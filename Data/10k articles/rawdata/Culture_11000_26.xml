The '''Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Gujranwala (BISE Gujranwala)''' is a body corporate under section 3(2) of Punjab Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Act 1976.  The [[Gujranwala]] city is located on the famous GT road 68&amp;nbsp;km on north side from Lahore and 220&amp;nbsp;km on southern side from the capital city of Islamabad &amp; Rawalpindi.The campus of Board is 1&amp;nbsp;km away from Lohianwala Bypass, GT road. This Board conducted its first examination in 1976.

== History ==
 
Board started functioning by obtaining buildings on rent. These building were actually residential  houses in the area of Satellite Town, Gujranwala. First building acquired on rent was 162-D satellite town Gujranwala. Then during the tenure of Qari Ghulam Sadiq Chairman with his devoted team Ch. Nisar Ahmad Secretary and Mr. Abdul Sattar Rashid Security Officer acquired a piece of land comprising 231 kanals or 28.8 acres near sialkot bypass, Lohianwala under Punjab Land Acquisition Act 1894 and started construction of its own campus. The boundary wall was completed during the tenure of Prof. Muhammad Amin, Chairman and under his supervision a team composed of Ch.

'''Cohousing'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/44/C0464450.html Cohousing definition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416055527/http://www.bartleby.com/61/44/C0464450.html |date=16 April 2009 }} (American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[intentional community]] of private homes clustered around shared space. Each attached or single family home has traditional amenities, including a private kitchen. Shared spaces typically feature a common house, which may include a large kitchen and dining area, laundry, and recreational spaces. Shared outdoor space may include parking, walkways, open space, and gardens. Neighbors also share resources like tools and lawnmowers.

Households have independent incomes and private lives, but neighbors collaboratively plan and manage community activities and shared spaces. The legal structure is typically a [[homeowner association]] or [[housing cooperative]]. Community activities feature regularly-scheduled shared meals, meetings, and workdays. Neighbors gather for parties, games, movies, or other events. Cohousing makes it easy to form clubs, organize child and elder care, and carpool.

Cohousing facilitates interaction among neighbors and thereby provides social, practical, economic, and environmental benefits.&lt;ref name="McCamant, Kathryn 1994"&gt;McCamant, Kathryn; Durrett, Charles. "Cohousing: A Contemporary Approach to Housing Ourselves." Berkeley, Ca.: Ten Speed Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Durrett, Charles 2009"&gt;Durrett, Charles. "Senior Cohousing: A Community Approach to Independent Living." Gabriola Island, B.C.: New Society Publishers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Cohousing communities generally share a set of common characteristics.

Cohousing communities are usually structured - in principle and often in [[architecture]] - to encourage frequent interactions and the formation of close relationships between their members. Neighbors are encouraged to cooperate within the community and to care for their neighbors. Cohousing developments are usually intentionally limited to around 20-40 homes and frequently feature large [[common area]]s for residents to interact in.

While cohousing developments are designed to encourage community, residents usually still have as much [[personal privacy]] as they want. Residents are able to choose how much they engage in order to find the right balance between their privacy and the community.

Decision making in cohousing communities is often based on forming a consensus within the community. Residents have shared space which they can all use, usually saving money; however, residents can still manage their own space to appeal to them.

==Origins==
The modern theory of cohousing originated in [[Denmark]] in the 1960s among groups of [[family|families]] who were dissatisfied with existing housing and communities that they felt did not meet their needs. Bodil Graae wrote a newspaper article titled "Children Should Have One Hundred Parents,"&lt;ref&gt;Graae, Bodil. "Børn skal have Hundrede Foraeldre", "Politiken" [Copenhagen], April 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; spurring a group of 50 families to organize around a community project in 1967. This group developed the cohousing project [[Sættedammen]], which is the oldest known modern cohousing community. Another key organizer was Jan Gudmand Høyer who drew inspiration from his architectural studies at Harvard and interaction with experimental U.S. communities of the era. He published the article "The Missing Link between Utopia and the Dated Single Family House" &lt;ref&gt;Gudmand-Høyer, Jan. "Det manglende led mellem utopi og det foraeldede en familiehus." "Information" 26 June 1968&lt;/ref&gt; in 1968, converging a second group.

The Danish term ''bofællesskab'' (living community) was introduced to [[North America]] as ''cohousing'' by two American [[architect]]s, Kathryn McCamant and [[Charles Durrett]], who visited several cohousing communities and wrote a book about it.&lt;ref name="McCamant, Kathryn 1994"/&gt; The book resonated with some existing and forming communities, such as Sharingwood in Washington state and N Street in California, who embraced the cohousing concept as a crystallization of what they were already about.  Though most cohousing groups seek to develop multi-generational communities, some focus on creating senior communities.  Charles Durrett later wrote a handbook on creating senior cohousing.&lt;ref name="Durrett, Charles 2009"/&gt; The first community in the United States to be designed, constructed and occupied specifically for cohousing is [[Muir Commons]] in Davis, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCamant|first=Kathryn |author2=Charles Durrett |author3=Ellen Hertzman|title=Cohousing: A Contemporary Approach to Housing Ourselves|edition=2nd|year=1994|publisher=Ten Speed Press|isbn=0-89815-539-8|page=208|quote=Muir Commons is the first cohousing community to be built in the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norwood|first=Ken|author2=Kathleen Smith|title=Rebuilding Community in America: Housing for Ecological Living, Personal Empowerment, and the New Extended Family|year=1995|publisher=Shared Living Resource Center|isbn=0-9641346-2-4|page=111|quote=Muir Commons was the first CoHousing community to be built entirely new in the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Architect]]s, Kathryn McCamant and [[Charles Durrett]] were responsible for the programming and the design of the site plan, common house and private houses.

There are precedents for [[List of New York City housing cooperatives|cohousing in the 1920s in New York]] with the [[housing cooperative|cooperative apartment housing]] with shared facilities and good social interaction. The [[Siheyuan]], or quadrangle design of housing in China has a shared courtyard and is thus similar in some respects to cohousing.

==Growth==
Cohousing communities are part of the new cooperative economy in the United States and are predicted to expand rapidly in the next few decades as individuals and families seek to live more sustainably, and in community with neighbors. Since the first cohousing community was completed in the U.S. – Muir Commons in Davis, California, now celebrating 25 years – more than 160 communities have been established in 25 states plus the District of Columbia, with more than 125 in process. For a listing of cohousing communities visit [http://www.cohousing.org/directory www.cohousing.org/directory]. Most cohousing communities are intergenerational with both children and elders; in recent years, senior cohousing focused on older adult needs have grown. These communities come in a variety, but are often environment friendly and socially sustainable.

Hundreds of cohousing communities exist in [[Denmark]] and other countries in northern [[Europe]]. In [[Canada]], there are 11 completed communities, and approximately 19 in the forming or development phase (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20131205153200/http://www.cohousing.ca/summary.htm]). There are more than 300 cohousing communities in the [[Netherlands]] (73 mixed-generation and 231 senior cohousing), with about 60 others in planning or construction phases.
&lt;ref name="FGW"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Community Addresses in The Netherlands
  | publisher = Federatie Gemeenschappelijk Wonen
  | url = http://www.gemeenschappelijkwonen.nl/?choice=88/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also communities in [[Australia]] (see [http://www.communities.org.au/ Cohousing Australia]), the [[United Kingdom]] (see UK Cohousing Network http://www.cohousing.org.uk for information, Threshold Centre Cohousing Community http://www.thresholdcentre.org.uk/ offers training), and other parts of the world.

Cohousing started to develop in the UK at the end of the 1990s. The movement has gradually built up momentum and there are now 14 purpose built cohousing communities. A further 40+ cohousing groups are developing projects and new groups are forming all the time. Cohousing communities in the UK range from around 8 households to around 30 households. Most communities are mixed communities with single people, couples and families but some are only for people over 50 and one is only for women over 50 years. The communities themselves range from new developments built to modern eco standards to conversions of everything from farms to Jacobean mansions to former hospital buildings and are in urban, rural and semi- rural locations.

==Design==
Because each cohousing community is planned in its context, a key feature of this model is its flexibility to the needs and values of its residents and the characteristics of the site. Cohousing can be [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]] or [[rural]]. The physical form is typically compact but varies from low-rise apartments to [[townhouse]]s to clustered [[detached house]]s. They tend to keep [[auto-free zones|cars to the periphery]] which promotes walking through the community and interacting with neighbors as well as increasing safety for children at play within the community. Shared green space is another characteristic, whether for gardening, play, or places to gather.  When more land is available than is needed for the physical structures, the structures are usually clustered closely together, leaving as much of the land as possible "open" for shared use.  This aspect of cohousing directly addresses the growing problem of [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].

[[Image:SunwardPanorama2003.jpg|frame|center|The Sunward Cohousing community illustrating greenspace preservation, tightly clustered housing, and parking on periphery, [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], 2003.]]

In addition to "from-scratch" new-built communities (including those physically retrofitting/re-using existing structures), there are also "retrofit" (aka "organic") communities in which neighbors create "intentional neighborhoods" by buying adjacent properties and removing fences. Often, they create common amenities such as Common Houses after the fact, while living there. N Street Cohousing in Davis, CA, is the canonical example of this type; it came together before the term Cohousing was popularized in the United States.

Cohousing differs from some types of [[intentional community|intentional communities]] in that the residents do not have a shared economy or a common set of beliefs or [[religion]], but instead invest in creating a socially rich and interconnected community. A non-hierarchical structure employing a [[consensus decision-making]] model is common in managing cohousing. Individuals do take on leadership roles, such as being responsible for coordinating a [[garden]] or facilitating a meeting.

==Ownership form==
Cohousing communities in the U.S. currently rely on one of two existing legal forms of real estate ownership: individually titled houses with common areas owned by a [[homeowner association]]([[condominium]])s or a [[housing cooperative]]. Condo ownership is most common because it fits financial institutions' and cities' models for multi-unit owner-occupied housing development. U.S. banks lend more readily on single-family homes and condominiums than [[housing cooperative]]s. [[Charles Durrett]] points out that rental cohousing is a very likely future model, as it already is being practiced in Europe.

Cohousing differs from standard condominium development and master-planned subdivisions because the development is designed by, or with considerable input from, its future residents.  The design process invariably emphasizes consciously fostering social relationships among its residents.  Common facilities are based on the actual needs of the residents, rather than on what a developer thinks will help sell units.  Turnover in cohousing developments is typically very low, and there is usually a waiting list for units to become available.

In Europe the term "joint building ventures" has been coined to define the form of ownership and housing characterized as cohousing. According to the European Urban Knowledge Network (EUKN): "Joint building ventures are a legal federation of persons willing to build who want to create owner-occupied housing and to participate actively in planning and building."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eukn.org/E_library/Housing/Housing_Policy/Housing_Need/Guideline_of_Joint_Building_Ventures_in_Hamburg EUKN, Guideline of Joint Building Ventures in Hamburg] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140812040026/http://www.eukn.org/E_library/Housing/Housing_Policy/Housing_Need/Guideline_of_Joint_Building_Ventures_in_Hamburg |date=12 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Corps Marko-Guestphalia Aachen''' is a fraternity (''[[Studentenverbindung]]'') in [[Aachen]], Germany, founded on December 2, 1871. It is one of 162 ''[[German Student Corps]]'' in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Latvia and Hungary today. The Corps is a member of the [[Weinheimer Senioren-Convent]] (WSC), the second oldest federation of classical European [[Corporation (university)|fraternal corporations]], with roots dating back to the 15th century and fraternities founded in several European countries.&lt;ref name="DieCorps"&gt;Die Corps. "Was sind die Corps? - Who are the Corps?" http://www.die-corps.de/interessenten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klimczuk"&gt;Klimczuk, Stephen &amp; [[Gerald Warner|Warner, Gerald]].

Membership in the fraternity is open to [[Honour|honorable]] men&lt;ref name="duel" /&gt; studying at one of Aachen's [[University|universities]] and is based exclusively on personality, good moral standing, and strength of character.&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;Die Corps. "Prinzipien der Corps" An article explaining the principles of being a Corps Student: http://www.die-corps.de/prinzipien.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Corps Marko-Guestphalia value and engage in the tradition of academic fencing&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt; as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure. Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s, Marko-Guestphalia's members wear the traditional [[couleur]], colored stripes, in green-white-black. The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, stemming from diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt; While many of their members stem from the west-Rhine region of Germany, Marko-Guestphalia enjoys a strong membership of international students (examples include Denmark, India, Italia, Serbia, Turkey, USA, Peru), similar to the internationally very open character of the RWTH.

== Fundamentals and principles ==
Like all ''German Student Corps'', Marko-Guestphalia expects tolerance from its members in [[German Student Corps#Politics|political]], [[German Student Corps#Sciences|scientific]] and [[List of members of German student corps|religious]] affairs.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt; Members are encouraged to have their own point of view about the world and be able to argue it, but Marko-Guestphalia as an entity always remains neutral. This ''[[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]]'' is a fundamental pillar of all Corps and differentiates them from fraternities who require a certain political or religious affinity.&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; The fraternity encourages freshly admitted (pledging "fox") members with diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds to prove themselves as valuable Corps brothers, purely on the basis of personal [[ethos|character]] and [[recognition (sociology)|merit]], before becoming eligible to be fully incorporated (''Rezeption'').&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt; The fraternity has about 300 members of all ages (including alumni) coming from or currently residing in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa. Every full member is a member for life.

Members of the Corps Marko-Guestphalia value and practice the tradition of engagements in ''[[academic fencing]]'', or ''"Mensur"'' in German, with members of other old-school fraternities. Academic fencing, originating in the [[German school of fencing]], is understood as a way to exercise good judgement and prove character,&lt;ref name="duel" /&gt; allowing participants to show determination by standing their ground under pressure, while enhancing the bonds between the Corps brothers at the same time.&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fechten"&gt;Die Corps. "Hoch bitte – Los!" An article explaining the role of academic fencing at Corps: http://www.die-corps.de/fechten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] described one of these fencing duels/challenges in his day and age; his description is remarkably similar to current practices.&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2c" /&gt; Marko-Guestphalia's members identify themselves wearing the traditional ''couleur'', colored stripes, as well as caps and/or other specific garments at official occasions. This tradition, known as "wearing colors" (German: ''Farben tragen''), provides means to recognize members of other fraternities and, likewise, identification for the Corps brothers with each other and their traditions.&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;

''Activity'' and ''responsibility'' are two fundamental expectations for fraternity members. With the goal to achieve members who are prepared to become active leaders in society, every Corps brother is expected to hold a leadership position at least once for a term ("Semester") while a student. Members are further encouraged to organize internal and open fraternity events that draw attention from other fraternities and guests from industry, academia, politics and other active societies.&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; Allocating the necessary resources appropriately and living up to set expectations teaches responsibility.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt; All members must show active participation in the regular fraternity Convents, providing the foundation for the fraternity's members to meet and discuss past, present and future developments. Decisions are cast in a democratic manner, sometimes after intense debates. Participation at such Convents teaches a better understanding of proper argumentation, group dynamics and critical analysis of other members' views, plans and arguments, thereby preparing its participants to become active members of society.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt; Similarly, every member must finish his higher educational degree with good academic standing in order to advance to the status of ''Alter Herr'' (alumnus).

Long-term guidance is expected from and provided by said ''Alte Herren'', who often remain very engaged and well connected with the fraternity. Every year at the end of May, student and alumni members of all German Student Corps meet in one of two cities ([[Weinheim]] and [[Bad Kösen]]) for three days to refresh their bonds with their fraternity and friends from the entire Corps network (WSC/[[Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband|KSCV]]).&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; In addition to these international meetings once a year, alumni join the student members for multiple local meetings, lasting an evening or a weekend. These regular meetings result in strong bonds spanning the generations within the fraternity.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;

=== Foundation ===
[[File:SchlägerOvBMuseumFriedrichsruh.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s student sword and helmet, comparable to those used by the fraternity's members then and now.]]
The fraternity was founded by three fraternity students of other fraternities on December 2, 1871 who had come to the [[RWTH Aachen University|Royal Rheinian-Westphalian Polytechnical School at Aachen]] for their graduate studies. The fraternity grew quickly and joined the [[Weinheimer Senioren-Convent]] (WSC) on May 17, 1872.

=== Today ===
The fraternity has official relationships with the [[Corps Saxo-Thuringia München]] in Munich and a close relationship with the other Corps of the ''[[Blaues Kartell]]'' with member fraternities [[Corps Altsachsen Dresden]], Corps Hannoverania Hanover and [[Corps Berlin]].

'''''Cosmos and Psyche: Intimations of a New World View''''' is a 2006 book by cultural historian [[Richard Tarnas]], in which the author proposes the existence of relationships between planetary transits and events in the lives of major historical figures, as well as cultural events.

==Summary==
Tarnas's first book, ''[[The Passion of the Western Mind]]'' serves as an introduction to ''Cosmos and Psyche''.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Grasse, "Cosmos and Psyche: An Interview with Richard Tarnas" ''The Mountain Astrologer'', issue #124, Dec/Jan 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Tarnas acknowledges that astrology's status in contemporary thought is, as he puts it, "the gold standard for superstition".&lt;ref&gt;Keiron Le Grice, [http://www.archai.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/LeGrice-–-The-Birth-of-a-New-Discipline-–-Archai-Issue-1.pdf The "Birth of a New Discipline: Archetypal Cosmology in Historical Perspective"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's objective is to challenge the [[materialism|materialistic]] and [[dysteleology|dysteleological]] assumptions of the [[Modernity|modern]] world view, and to set forth evidence for a correspondence between [[planetary alignment]]s and patterns of human history. The book attempts to provide an archetypal cosmology to accompany Tarnas's proposed [[participatory epistemology]], "in which human beings are regarded as an essential vehicle for the creative selfunfolding of reality".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Freeman, 'A Daniel Come to Judgement? Dennett and the Revisioning of Transpersonal Theory',  ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'', 13, No. 3, 2006, pp.95–109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.N. Ferrer, ''Revisioning Transpersonal Theory'' p.115 (New York: SUNYPress, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for ''Cosmos and Psyche'' began when Tarnas realized that the climax of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s cultural revolution]] took place precisely during the only Uranus-Pluto conjunction in the 20th century. For Tarnas, the characteristics of the astrological entity [[Uranus]] match with those of the Greek mythical figure [[Prometheus]] better than with those of the conservative mythological figure [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]. Tarnas associates the astrological planet Uranus with freedom and change, while [[Pluto]] is associated with evolution, instinct, and ''[[eros]]''. Thus in Tarnas's theory, the apparent relationships ([[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunctions]], [[Opposition (planets)|oppositions]], and [[Square (astrological aspect)|squares]]) of Uranus and Pluto have momentous potential for human history. (Tarnas's research has not found significant correlation between the zodiac signs and human events.) Tarnas further observed that a Uranus-Pluto opposition occurred during the [[French Revolution]]. Like the 1960s, the French Revolution featured the characteristics of Uranus-Pluto alignment: revolution through the manifestation of the suppressed. These historical-astrological coincidences or [[synchronicity|synchronicities]] led Tarnas to further explore the relationship of pivotal moments in Western cultural history to the conjunctions, oppositions, and squares of the outer planets. The historical events analyzed include the [[Reformation]], the [[Renaissance]], [[Romanticism]], the [[Scientific Revolution]], the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[Modernism]], [[Postmodernism]], etc.

In the book Tarnas discusses the correspondences between planetary transits and the biographies of such figures as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[William Blake]], [[Walt Whitman]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. Tarnas believes that the correspondences between historical events and astrological alignments are consistently astonishing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OLaJ2HhW2zcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cosmos+and+psyche&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZcLYT8uTEsjMhAeP87i6Aw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=astonishing&amp;f=false google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarnas uses [[C. G. Jung]]'s concept of [[synchronicity]], or meaningful [[coincidence]], to argue that there is an [[Synchronicity|acausal]] connection between the outer world and the human psyche.

Tarnas does not argue for a causal relationship between the planets and human events:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the perspective I am suggesting here, reflecting the dominant trend in contemporary astrological theory, the planets do not "cause" specific events any more than the hands on a clock "cause" a specific time.  Rather, the planetary positions are indicative of the cosmic state or archetypal dynamics at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmos and Psyche, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
Thomas Meaney panned ''Cosmos and Psyche'' in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', writing that the premise may sound "like an elaborate joke". Calling it "unadulterated [[crackpottery|crack-pottery]]", he wrote that Tarnas's observations were vacuous, opining that they "...drain human events of meaning rather than fill them with significance."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113779467499152337?mod=googlewsj "Writer's Block: Cosmos &amp; Psyche"] ''The Wall Street Journal'' JANUARY 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews were more positive. In ''[[The Oakland Tribune#ANG .26 InsideBayArea.com|Inside Bay Area]]'', Esther Fields opined that "...[n]ot only does it challenge modern assumptions about how the world works, but it also points the way toward a new way of understanding your place in the cosmos...and shows how we are on the brink of world changes as great as those of the time of Galileo and Copernicus."&lt;ref&gt;Esther Fields, "Spring into a great read" [http://www.insidebayarea.com/localnews/ci_3672310 insidebayarea.com] ''Inside Bay Area'' 4 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Anthroposophist]] Frederick Dennehy opined in ''Lilipoh'' magazine that "Tarnas’ deeply radical hypothesis is that the disenchantment of the modern universe is unreal – the result of a “simplistic epistemology” and moral positioning totally inadequate to the depths, complexity and grandeur of the cosmos."&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Dennehy, "The Disenchantment of the Modern Universe and the Tale of Two Suitors" [http://www.lilipoh.com/articles/2006/summer/the_disenchantment_of_the_modern_universe_and_the_tale_of_two_suitors.aspx lilipoh.com] Lilipoh #44 - Summer 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Observer]]'', astrologer Neil Spencer favorably contrasted Tarnas's book ''Cosmos and Psyche'' to the writings of [[Richard Dawkins]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'In effect, the objective world has been ruled by the Enlightenment, the subjective world by Romanticism,' Richard Tarnas says in his remarkable book Cosmos &amp; Psyche, an attempt to heal that schism, to 're-enchant' the cosmos and redeem what he calls the 'pathos' of the modern condition. By contrast, Dawkins' one-eyed view turns reason, as Blake warned, into the enemy of imagination and of art.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Spencer,[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/aug/12/features.review "The Dawkins delusion: science good, the rest bad"] ''[[The Observer]]'', Sunday 12 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[John Heron]] critiqued the methodology and conclusions of ''Cosmos'' in the journal ''Network Review'', describing 18 internal problems with Tarnas' theory.&lt;ref&gt;John Heron, "A commentary on Richard Tarnas' Cosmos and Psyche'" ''Network Review: Journal of the Scientific and Medical Network'', No. 95, Winter 2007, pp. 11-16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following issue of ''Network Review'', Keiron Le Grice responded point-by-point to Heron's critique.&lt;ref&gt;"A Response to John Heron’s commentary on Cosmos and Psyche" [http://www.scimednet.org/pdf/ntwrk96.pdf scimednet.org] ''Network Review'' Winter 2007 p13 pub by Scientific &amp; Medical Network&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rob Brezsny]], American astrologer, opined that ''Cosmos and Psyche'' is "the definitive astrology book of the 21st century—probably the 20th century, too."&lt;ref&gt;Damon Orion, [http://alibi.com/feature/41461/Sign-Language.html alibi.com] "Sign Language: A skeptic’s cosmic quest for a reason to believe in astrology"&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'' magazine [[Jordi Pigem]] opined, &lt;blockquote&gt;In the last ten years, landmark works...have been reflecting and kindling a growing awareness that nature is not merely a sum of molecules obeying physical and chemical laws, but a living, sensuous, and ensouled matrix in which we fully participate and belong. Tarnas' ''Cosmos and Psyche'' extends this rising awareness beyond the bounds of the biosphere. Our psyche is not only deeply connected with our immediate natural environment, but with the whole of the cosmos encompassing us, with the rhythms of the planets we can see above us on clear nights. Searching beneath the depths of the psyche, Tarnas has found the heights of the cosmos. ''Cosmos and Psyche'' may radically transform the way we see cultural and political history, individual life journeys, and our sense of participation in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;"Towards a Meaningful Universe", ''[[Tikkun (magazine)]]'', May–June 2007, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Daniel Pinchbeck]], writing in ''Reality Sandwich'', opined that ''Cosmos'' was "scrupulously researched and carefully argued", and that it advances "a radical thesis...which seeks to revive astrology as a serious intellectual discipline and provide a cosmological missing link between the human world and the greater universe in which we are embedded." Pinchbeck writes that ''Cosmos'' may offer "a transformative matrix for reconceiving our relationship to the cosmos."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Pinchbeck, "[http://www.realitysandwich.com/psyching_out_cosmos Psyching Out The Cosmos]" 20 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent extension to the [[Death and culture|cultural relationship with death]] is the increasing number of people who die having created a large amount of digital content, such as [[social media]] profiles, that will remain after death. This may result in concern and confusion, because of automated features of dormant accounts (e.g. birthday reminders), uncertainty of the deceased's preferences that profiles be deleted or left as a memorial, and whether information that may violate the deceased's privacy (such as email or browser history) should be made accessible to family.

Issues with how this information is sensitively dealt with are further complicated as it may belong to the service provider (not the deceased) and many do not have clear policies on what happens to the accounts of deceased users. While some sites, including [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], have policies related to death, others remain dormant until deleted due to inactivity or transferred to family or friends. It is expected that the accounts of deceased people will outnumber those of active users unless providers include specific policies and accounts' management tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://what-if.xkcd.com/69/|title=When, if ever, will Facebook contain more profiles of dead people than of living ones?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital inheritance==
{{Main|Digital inheritance}}
''Digital inheritance'' is the process of handing over (personal) [[Digital media|digital assets]] to (human) [[Beneficiary|beneficiaries]]. These digital assets include [[digital estate]]s and the right to use them. It may include bank accounts, writings, photographs, and social interactions.

There are several services that offer to keep multiple passwords, sending them to people of personal choice after death. Some of these send the customer an email from time to time, prompting to confirm that that person is still alive, and failure to respond to multiple emails makes the service provider to assume that the person has deceased, and will thereafter give out the passwords as previously requested.&lt;ref name=Duffy2012/&gt; The ''Data Inheritance'' function from SecureSafe gives an "activator code" that the customer will hand to another trustworthy person of personal choice, and in the event of death that person then enters the code into Secure Safe's system to get access to the deceased person's digital inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whathype.com/when-you-die-will-your-digital-data-die-with-you/ |title=When You Die Will Your Digital Data Die With You? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=whathype.com |publisher= |access-date=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy Locker and [https://www.safebeyond.com/ SafeBeyond] require two verifiers who both must confirm the death, as well as providing a death certificate, before any passwords will be handed out.&lt;ref name=Duffy2012&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2410635,00.asp |title=Get Organized: Passing on Your Passwords |last1=Duffy |first1=Jill |last2= |first2= |date=2012-10-08 |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=PCMag Digital Group |access-date=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those who are paranoid about their online Privacy, platforms like LifeBank offer a helpful secure capability to store all internet account passwords offline whilst ensuring that a trusted person is given permission to access the individual's LifeBank when they die.  This gives the inheritor the ability to access and edit accounts, including deleting information or indeed the entire account.

'''Democracy Day''' is a [[Holidays in Nigeria|public holiday]] in [[Nigeria]]. Until, June 6, 2018, it used to be held annually on [[May 29]]. It was a tradition that held for 18 years, beginning in 2000. It now holds on June 12.

May 29, celebrated as Nigeria's Democracy Day, was a public holiday to commemorate the restoration of democracy in the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]], when the newly elected [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] took office as the [[President of Nigeria]] in May 1999 ending multiple decades of military rule that began in 1966 and had been interrupted only by a brief period of democracy from 1979 to 1983.

On June 6, 2018, eight days after May 29, 2018 had been celebrated as Democracy Day, the President Buhari-led Federal Government of Nigeria declared June 12 to be the new Democracy Day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://punchng.com/buhari-declares-june-12-democracy-day-honours-abiola-with-gcfr/|title=Buhari declares June 12 Democracy Day, honours Abiola with GCFR|work=Punch Newspapers|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This was done to commemorate the democratic election of [[Moshood Abiola|MKO Abiola]] on June 12, 1993, in what has been adjudged to be Nigeria's freest and fairest elections. It was, however, cancelled by the [[Ibrahim Babangida]] Junta.

==Background==
After gaining independence in 1960 from [[Great Britain]], Nigeria fell prey to [[Nigerian civil war|civil war]] and the first of so many military coups in 1966.  Democracy was briefly restored from 1979 to 1983 to the country, but for most of its independent history, Nigeria was ruled by a series of [[Nigerian military juntas of 1966–1979 and 1983–1998|military juntas]]. The last major military ruler, Gen. [[Sani Abacha]], died suddenly in 1998. His successor, Gen. [[Abdulsalami Abubakar]] promised a transition to democracy, and accordingly a new [[Constitution of Nigeria|constitution]] was adopted on May 5th, 1999. Elections were held and retired Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who had previously governed Nigeria as a military ruler, was elected the new president. 

The end of military rule brought about a new era of regular elections as well as the return of civil liberties, free press and an end to arbitrary arrests and torture, although human rights violations still occur regularly. Nigeria also began a long campaign against the bureaucratic and military corruption that had paralyzed its economy and severely tarnished its international reputation.

'''''Dol hareubangs''''', also called '''''tol harubangs''''', '''''hareubangs''''', or '''''harubangs''''', are large rock statues found on [[Jeju Island]] off the southern tip of [[South Korea]].  They are considered to be gods offering both protection and fertility and were placed outside of gates for protection against [[demon]]s travelling between realities.

==Description==
Dol hareubangs are carved from porous [[basalt]] ([[volcanic rock]]) and can be up to three metres high. The statues' faces feature grinning expressions, bulging eyes without pupils, a long, broad nose, and slight smile, and their hands rest on their bellies, one slightly above the other. In sets of two, one has a higher left hand, and the other a higher right hand. The hat is commonly described as [[phallic]] or [[mushroom]]-like.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Etymology==
The name ''dol hareubang'' derives from the Korean word for "stone" (''dol'' 돌), plus the [[Jeju dialect]] word ''hareubang'' (하르방), meaning "grandfather" or "senior" (''harabeoji'' [할아버지] in Standard Korean), and was coined in the mid-20th century.  Other earlier names for the statues include ''beoksumeori'', ''museongmok'', and ''useongmok''.  ''Beoksumeori'', meaning [[shamanism|shaman]] head, is used in the former area of Jeongui ''[[Hyeon]]'' (county), ''museongmok'' in Daejeong Hyeon and Jeongui Hyeon, and ''useongmok'' only in Jeju Hyeon.  Historically, the ''[[Tamna]] Chronicles'' called them  ''ongjungseok'' (옹중석/翁仲石), but this usage is unknown today.

==History==
[[Image:Korea jeju harubang.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A ''dol hareubang'' in the [[National Museum of Korea]] in Seoul]]
There are three main theories as to the origin of ''dol hareubangs'': either that they were introduced by visitors from the sea, that they are a counterpart to the ''[[jangseung]]s'' (totem poles) of mainland Korea, or that they spread with shamanic mushroom culture.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  ''Jangseungs'' are also called ''beoksu'' in southern Korea, and this similarity with the name ''beoksumeori'' lends credence to the second theory.
   
According to the ''Tamnaji'' a work dealing with the geography of Jejudo, the first dolhareubang was manufactured in 1754.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yoo|first1=Myeonng-jong|title=100 Cultural Symbols of Korea|date=September 10, 2008|publisher=Discovery Media|location=431, king’s garden office hotel 3rd complex, 72, naesoo-dong, Jongno-gu. seoul, korea|page=110|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dol hareubangs'' produced from 1763 to 1765 once stood outside the eastern, western, and southern gates of the [[Jeju City]] fortress as guardian deities.

In 2014, a [[Korea Aerospace University]] Professor Woo Sil-ha found a Chinese seokinsang (石人像, stone man statue) [http://www.ihalla.com/upimages/gisaimg/201410/29_479354.jpg strikingly similar] to ''dol hareubang'' in the Jianping Museum, [[Chaoyang, Liaoning]], China. The seokinsang which is of Chinese [[Liao dynasty]] (907–1125) was discovered in December 2011 in Heishui, [[Jianping County]], [[Liaoning]], China. The Professor said that the origin of ''dol hareubang'' requires re-examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="제주 돌하르방-중국 요나라 석인상 매우 유사"…돌하르방 기원 논쟁 재점화 |trans-title="Jeju Dol hareubang - Very similar to Seokinsang of Chinese Liao dynasty"...

==''Dol hareubangs'' today==
[[Image:Dol Hareubang at Hyeopjae Beach.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A ''dol hareubang'' at Hyeopjae Beach on [[Jeju Island]]]]
''Dol hareubangs'' have become the symbol of Jeju Island, and replicas of various sizes are sold as tourist souvenirs.  The statues are sometimes sold as sources of fertility, and small replicas are sometimes given to women with fertility problems. The origin of this may have more to do with Jeju Do's present-day status as a "honeymoon island" than tradition.

[[File:Comedy and tragedy masks without background.svg|upright=0.9|right|thumb|Comedy and tragedy masks]]
'''Drama''' is the specific [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of [[fiction]] [[Mimesis|represented]] in [[performance]]: a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[mime]], [[ballet]], etc, performed in a [[theatre]], or on [[Radio drama|radio]] or television.&lt;ref name="elam98"&gt;Elam (1980, 98).&lt;/ref&gt; Considered as a genre of [[poetry]] in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and the [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] modes ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of [[dramatic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Fergusson]] writes that "a drama, as distinguished from a [[Lyric poetry|lyric]], is not primarily a composition in the verbal medium; the [[Dialogue (fiction)|words]] result, as one might put it, from the underlying [[Dramatic structure|structure of incident]] and [[Character (arts)|character]]. As [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]] remarks, 'the poet, or "maker" should be the maker of [[Plot (narrative)|plots]] rather than of verses; since he is a poet because he [[Mimesis|imiates]], and what he imitates are [[Action (philosophy)|actions]]'" (1949, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The term "drama" comes from a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "[[Action (philosophy)|action]]" ([[Classical Greek]]: {{lang|grc|δρᾶμα}}, ''drama''), which is derived from "I do" ([[Classical Greek]]: {{lang|grc|δράω}}, ''drao''). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional [[Genre|generic]] division between [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. 

In English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages), the word "[[Play (theatre)|play]]" or "game" (translating the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''pleġan'' or [[Latin]] ''ludus'') was the standard term used to describe drama until [[William Shakespeare]]'s time—just as its creator was a "play-maker" rather than a "dramatist" and the building was a "play-house" rather than a "[[Theater (building)|theatre]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wickham (1959, 32—41; 1969, 133; 1981, 68—69). The sense of the creator of plays as a "maker" rather than a "writer" is preserved in the word "[[playwright]]." [[The Theatre]], one of the first purpose-built playhouses in London, was "a self-conscious latinism to describe one particular playhouse" rather than a term for the buildings in general (1967, 133). The word 'dramatist' "was at that time still unknown in the English language" (1981, 68).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The use of "drama" in a more narrow sense to designate a specific ''type'' of [[play (theatre)|play]] dates from the modern era. "Drama" in this sense refers to a play that is ''neither'' a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, [[Émile Zola|Zola's]] ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' ([[1873 in literature|1873]]) or [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov's]] ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' ([[1887 in literature|1887]]). It is this narrower sense that the [[film]] and [[television]] industries, along with [[film studies]], adopted to describe "[[Drama (film and television)|drama]]" as a [[Film genre|genre]] within their respective media. "[[Radio drama]]" has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance, it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of [[radio]].&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 894–900).&lt;/ref&gt;

The enactment of drama in [[theatre]], performed by [[actor]]s on a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] before an [[audience]], presupposes [[Collaboration|collaborative]] modes of production and a [[collective]] form of reception. The [[Dramatic structure|structure of dramatic texts]], unlike other forms of [[literature]], is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.&lt;ref&gt;Pfister (1977, 11).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mime is a form of drama where the action of a story is told only through the movement of the body. Drama can be combined with [[music]]: the dramatic text in [[opera]] is generally sung throughout; as for in some ballets dance "expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [https://www.britannica.com/art/dance/Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Musical theatre|Musicals]] include both spoken [[dialogue]] and [[song]]s; and some forms of drama have [[incidental music]] or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue ([[melodrama]] and Japanese [[Noh|Nō]], for example).&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;See the entries for "opera", "musical theatre, American", "melodrama" and "Nō" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Closet drama]] describes a form that is intended to be read, rather than performed.&lt;ref name="closet"&gt;''[[Manfred]]'' by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], for example, is a good example of a "[[Verse drama and dramatic verse|dramatic poem]]." See the entry on "Byron (George George)" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Improvisational theatre|improvisation]], the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.&lt;ref name="impro"&gt;Some forms of improvisation, notably the [[Commedia dell'arte]], improvise on the basis of 'lazzi' or rough outlines of scenic action (see Gordon (1983) and Duchartre (1929)). All forms of improvisation take their cue from their immediate response to one another, their characters' situations (which are sometimes established in advance), and, often, their interaction with the audience. The classic formulations of improvisation in the theatre originated with [[Joan Littlewood]] and [[Keith Johnstone]] in the UK and [[Viola Spolin]] in the USA; see Johnstone (1981) and Spolin (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Western drama==
===Classical Greek drama===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Greece}}
[[File:Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks - Princeton Art Museum.jpg|thumb|right|''Relief of a seated poet ([[Menander]]) with masks of New Comedy'', 1st century BC – early 1st century AD, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]
[[Western culture|Western]] drama originates in [[classical Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54), and Ley (2007, 206). Taxidou notes that "most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct" (2004, 104). Brown writes that [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek drama]] "was essentially the creation of [[classical Athens]]: all the dramatists who were later regarded as classics were active at Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the time of the [[Athenian democracy]]), and all the surviving plays date from this period" (1998, 441). "The dominant culture of [[Classical Athens|Athens in the fifth century]]", Goldhill writes, "can be said to have invented [[theatre]]" (1997, 54).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatrical culture]] of the [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] produced three [[genre]]s of drama: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]]. Their origins remain obscure, though by the 5th century BC they were [[institution]]alised in [[Agon|competitions]] held as part of [[Athenian festivals|festivities]] celebrating the god [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13–15) and Banham (1998, 441–447).&lt;/ref&gt; Historians know the names of many ancient Greek dramatists, not least [[Thespis]], who is credited with the innovation of an actor ("''hypokrites''") who speaks (rather than sings) and impersonates a [[Character (arts)|character]] (rather than speaking in his own person), while interacting with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] and its leader ("''[[coryphaeus]]''"), who were a traditional part of the performance of non-dramatic poetry ([[dithyramb]]ic, [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[Epic poetry|epic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 441–444). For more information on these ancient Greek dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Greek dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Greek dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a small fraction of the work of five dramatists, however, has survived to this day: we have a small number of complete texts by the tragedians [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], and the comic writers [[Aristophanes]] and, from the late 4th century, [[Menander]].&lt;ref&gt;The theory that ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' was not written by [[Aeschylus]] would bring this number to six dramatists whose work survives.&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus' historical tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'' is the oldest surviving drama, although when it won first prize at the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]] competition in 472 BC, he had been writing plays for more than 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 8) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–16).&lt;/ref&gt; The competition ("''[[agon]]''") for tragedies may have begun as early as 534 BC; official records ("''didaskaliai''") begin from 501 BC when the [[satyr play]] was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13, 15) and Banham (1998, 442).&lt;/ref&gt; Tragic dramatists were required to present a [[tetralogy]] of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play (though exceptions were made, as with Euripides' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'' in 438 BC). [[Comedy]] was officially recognized with a prize in the competition from 487 to 486 BC.

Five comic dramatists competed at the City [[Dionysia]] (though during the [[Peloponnesian War]] this may have been reduced to three), each offering a single comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 18) and Banham (1998, 444–445).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is traditionally divided between "old comedy" (5th century BC), "middle comedy" (4th century BC) and "new comedy" (late 4th century to 2nd BC).&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 444–445).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Roman drama===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Rome}}
[[File:Statuette actor Petit Palais ADUT00192.jpg|thumb|An ivory statuette of a Roman actor of [[tragedy]], 1st century CE.]]
Following the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BC) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BC, Rome encountered [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]].&lt;ref name="h43"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43).&lt;/ref&gt; From the later years of the republic and by means of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; [[Theater of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 36, 47).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43). For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 46–47).&lt;/ref&gt; The first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]] were the [[Tragedy|tragedies]] and [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] that [[Livius Andronicus]] wrote from 240 BC.&lt;ref name="h47"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]] also began to write drama.&lt;ref name="h47" /&gt; No plays from either writer have survived. While both dramatists composed in both [[genres]], Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies; their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama.&lt;ref name="h47" /&gt;

By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a [[guild]] of writers (''collegium poetarum'') had been formed.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47–48).&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman comedies that have survived are all ''[[fabula palliata]]'' (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: [[Plautus|Titus Maccius Plautus]] (Plautus) and [[Terence|Publius Terentius Afer]] (Terence).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48–49).&lt;/ref&gt; In re-working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] in dividing the drama into [[episode]]s and introduced musical accompaniment to its [[dialogue]] (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence).&lt;ref name="h49"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49).&lt;/ref&gt; The action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from [[eavesdropping]].&lt;ref name="h49" /&gt;

Plautus, the more popular of the two, wrote between 205 and 184 BC and twenty of his comedies survive, of which his [[farce]]s are best known; he was admired for the [[wit]] of his dialogue and his use of a variety of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meters]].&lt;ref name="h48"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48).&lt;/ref&gt; All of the six comedies that Terence wrote between 166 and 160 BC have survived; the complexity of his plots, in which he often combined several Greek originals, was sometimes denounced, but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour.&lt;ref name="h48" /&gt; No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians—[[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]], and [[Lucius Accius]].&lt;ref name="h49" /&gt;

From the time of the empire, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].&lt;ref name="h50"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 50).&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49–50).&lt;/ref&gt; Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.&lt;ref name="h50" /&gt;

===Medieval===
{{Main article|Medieval theatre}}
[[File:Castle of Perseverance staging.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stage drawing from a 15th-century [[vernacular]] [[morality play]] ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' (as found in the [[Macro Manuscript]]).]]
Beginning in the [[early Middle Ages]], churches staged dramatised versions of biblical events, known as [[liturgical drama]]s, to enliven annual celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76, 78). Many churches would have only performed one or two [[liturgical drama]]s per year and a larger number never performed any at all.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest example is the [[Easter]] trope ''Whom do you Seek? (Quem-Quaeritis)'' (c. 925).&lt;ref name="Brockett_76"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76).&lt;/ref&gt; Two groups would sing responsively in [[Latin]], though no impersonation of [[Character (arts)|characters]] was involved. By the 11th century, it had spread through Europe to [[Russia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[Italy]]; excluding [[Al-Andalus|Islamic-era Spain]].

In the 10th century, [[Hrosvitha]] wrote six plays in Latin modeled on [[Terence]]'s comedies, but which treated religious subjects.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 77).&lt;/ref&gt; Her plays are the first known to be composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western drama of the post-Classical era.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"/&gt; Later, [[Hildegard of Bingen]] wrote a [[music]]al drama, ''Ordo Virtutum'' (c. 1155).&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"/&gt;

One of the most famous of the early [[Secularity|secular]] plays is the courtly [[pastoral]] ''[[Jeu de Robin et Marion|Robin and Marion]]'', written in the 13th century in French by [[Adam de la Halle]].&lt;ref&gt;Wickham (1981, 191; 1987, 141).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Interlude of the Student and the Girl]]'' (c. 1300), one of the earliest known in English, seems to be the closest in tone and form to the contemporaneous French [[farce]]s, such as ''[[The Boy and the Blind Man]].''&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 9, 11, 38, 45), Dillon (2006, 213), and Wickham (1976, 195; 1981, 189–190). In ''Early English Stages'' (1981), Wickham points to the existence of ''[[The Interlude of the Student and the Girl]]'' as evidence that the old-fashioned view that [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] began in England in the 1550s with ''[[Gammer Gurton's Needle]]'' and ''[[Ralph Roister Doister]]'' is mistaken, ignoring as it does a rich tradition of [[Medieval theatre|medieval comic drama]]; see Wickham (1981, 178).&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of plays survive from [[France]] and [[Germany]] in the [[late Middle Ages]], when some type of religious drama was performed in nearly every European country. Many of these plays contained [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s, and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt; In England, trade guilds began to perform [[vernacular]] "[[mystery plays]]," which were composed of long cycles of a large number of playlets or "pageants," of which four are [[Extant literature|extant]]: [[York Mystery Plays|York]] (48 plays), [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] (24), [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] (32) and the so-called "[[N-Town Plays|N-Town]]" (42). ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play]]'' from the Wakefield cycle is a farcical story of a stolen sheep that its [[protagonist]], Mak, tries to pass off as his new-born child asleep in a crib; it ends when the shepherds from whom he has stolen are summoned to the [[Nativity of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morality plays]] (a modern term) emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished in the early [[Elizabethan era]] in England. Characters were often used to represent different ethical ideals. ''[[Everyman]]'', for example, includes such figures as Good Deeds, Knowledge and Strength, and this characterisation reinforces the conflict between good and evil for the audience.  ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' (c. 1400—1425) depicts an archetypal figure's progress from birth through to death. ''[[Horestes]]'' (c. 1567), a late "hybrid morality" and one of the earliest examples of an English [[revenge play]], brings together the classical story of [[Orestes]] with a [[Vice (character)|Vice]] from the medieval [[Allegory|allegorical]] tradition, alternating comic, [[slapstick]] scenes with serious, [[Tragedy|tragic]] ones.&lt;ref&gt;Spivack (1958, 251-303), Bevington (1962, 58-61, 81-82, 87, 183), and Weimann (1978, 155).&lt;/ref&gt; Also important in this period were the folk dramas of the [[Mummers Play]], performed during the [[Christmas]] season. Court [[masque]]s were particularly popular during the reign of [[Henry VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 101-103).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabethan and Jacobean===
{{Main article|English Renaissance theatre}}
One of the great flowerings of drama in [[England]] occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries. Many of these plays were written in verse, particularly [[iambic pentameter]]. In addition to Shakespeare, such authors as [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Thomas Middleton]], and [[Ben Jonson]] were prominent playwrights during this period. As in the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], historical plays celebrated the lives of past kings, enhancing the image of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] monarchy. Authors of this period drew some of their storylines from [[Greek mythology]] and [[Roman mythology]] or from the plays of eminent Roman playwrights such as [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].

===English Restoration comedy===
{{Main article|Restoration comedy}}
[[File:Colley Cibber as Lord Foppington in The Relapse by John Vanbrugh engraving.jpg|thumb|[[Colley Cibber]] as the extravagant and affected Lord Foppington, "brutal, evil, and smart", in [[John Vanbrugh|Vanbrugh's]] ''[[The Relapse]]'' (1696).]]

[[Restoration comedy]] refers to English comedies written and performed in England during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710. [[Comedy of manners]] is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy.&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur [https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; After [[London theatre closure 1642|public theatre had been banned]] by the [[Puritan]] regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 with the Restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] signalled a renaissance of [[English drama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hatch|first1=Mary Jo|title=The Three Faces of Leadership: Manager, Artist, Priest|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration comedy is known for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness, urbane, cosmopolitan [[wit]], up-to-the-minute topical writing, and crowded and bustling plots. Its dramatists stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] plays, and even from [[Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Classics|classical]] comedies, combining the various plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized "variety" within as well as between plays. Restoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of the first professional female playwright, [[Aphra Behn]], in the 1680s is an important exception. In the mid-1690s, a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are significantly different from each other.

The unsentimental or "hard" comedies of [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]], and [[George Etherege]] reflected the atmosphere at Court and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic [[machismo|macho]] lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]] (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). The single play that does most to support the charge of [[obscenity]] levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's masterpiece ''[[The Country Wife]]'' (1675), whose title contains a [[Lascivious behavior|lewd]] [[pun]] and whose notorious "china scene" is a series of sustained [[double entendre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|ROI9FhR6URI|The "China scene" from Wycherley's play}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the "softer" comedies of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] and [[John Vanbrugh]] set out to appeal to more socially diverse audience with a strong middle-class element, as well as to female spectators. The comic focus shifts from young lovers outwitting the older generation to the vicissitudes of marital relations. In Congreve's ''[[Love for Love]]'' (1695) and ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700), the give-and-take set pieces of couples testing their attraction for one another have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the latter's famous "Proviso" scene. Vanbrugh's ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'' (1697) has a light touch and more humanly recognisable characters, while ''[[The Relapse]]'' (1696) has been admired for its throwaway wit and the characterisation of Lord Foppington, an extravagant and affected [[burlesque]] [[fop]] with a dark side.&lt;ref&gt;''The Provoked Wife'' is something of a Restoration [[problem play]] in its attention to the subordinate legal position of married women and the complexities of "divorce" and separation, issues that had been highlighted in the mid-1690s by some notorious cases before the [[House of Lords]].&lt;/ref&gt; The tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out by the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did.&lt;ref&gt;Interconnected causes for this shift in taste were [[demographic]] change, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, [[William III of England|William]]'s and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]'s dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]] (founded in 1692). When [[Jeremy Collier]] attacked Congreve and Vanbrugh in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'' in 1698, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place.&lt;/ref&gt; At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of ''The Way of the World'', Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by [[sentimental comedy]] and the drama of exemplary morality.

===Modern and postmodern===
The pivotal and innovative contributions of the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th-century]] Norwegian dramatist [[Henrik Ibsen]] and the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th-century]] German [[theatre practitioner]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] dominate modern drama; each inspired a tradition of imitators, which include many of the greatest playwrights of the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1993, 25–26) and Moi (2006, 17). Moi writes that "Ibsen is the most important playwright writing after Shakespeare. He is the founder of modern theater. His plays are world classics, staged on every continent, and studied in classrooms everywhere. In any given year, there are hundreds of Ibsen productions in the world." Ibsenites include [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Arthur Miller]]; Brechtians include [[Dario Fo]], [[Joan Littlewood]], [[W. H. Auden]] [[Peter Weiss]], [[Heiner Müller]], [[Peter Hacks]], [[Tony Kushner]], [[Caryl Churchill]], [[John Arden]], [[Howard Brenton]], [[Edward Bond]], and [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]].&lt;/ref&gt; The works of both playwrights are, in their different ways, both [[Modernism|modernist]] and [[Realism (theatre)|realist]], incorporating formal [[Experimental theatre|experimentation]], [[meta-theatre|meta-theatricality]], and [[Social criticism|social critique]].&lt;ref&gt;Moi (2006, 1, 23–26). Taxidou writes: "It is probably historically more accurate, although methodologically less satisfactory, to read the [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalist movement in the theatre]] in conjunction with the more anti-illusionist aesthetics of the theatres of the same period. These interlock and overlap in all sorts of complicated ways, even when they are vehemently denouncing each other (perhaps particularly when) in the favoured mode of the time, the manifesto" (2007, 58).&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the traditional theoretical discourse of genre, Ibsen's work has been described as the culmination of "[[Tragedy#Modern development|liberal tragedy]]", while Brecht's has been aligned with an [[Historicization|historicised]] comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1966) and Wright (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important playwrights of the modern era include Antonin Artaud, [[August Strindberg]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Ernst Toller]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Dario Fo]], [[Heiner Müller]], and [[Caryl Churchill]].

== Opera ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
[[Opera|Western opera]] is a dramatic art form that arose during the [[Renaissance]] in an attempt to revive the [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|classical Greek drama]] in which dialogue, dance, and song were combined. Being strongly intertwined with [[Classical music|western classical music]], the opera has undergone enormous changes in the past four centuries and it is an important form of theatre until this day. Noteworthy is the major influence of the German 19th-century composer [[Wagner|Richard Wagner]] on the opera tradition. In his view, there was no proper balance between music and theatre in the operas of his time, because the music seemed to be more important than the dramatic aspects in these works. To restore the connection with the classical drama, he entirely renewed the operatic form to emphasize the equal importance of music and drama in works that he called "[[music drama]]s".

[[Chinese opera]] has seen a more conservative development over a somewhat longer period of time.

== Pantomime ==
{{Main|Pantomime}}
[[Pantomime]] (informally '''panto'''),&lt;ref&gt;Lawner, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[musical theatre|musical comedy]] stage production, designed for family entertainment. It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom, generally during the Christmas and New Year season and, to a lesser extent, in other English-speaking countries. Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing, employs gender-crossing actors, and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or [[Folklore|folk tale]].&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid-Walsh, Jacqueline. "Pantomime", ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', Jack Zipes (ed.), Oxford University Press (2006), {{ISBN|9780195146561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer (1969), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.

These stories follow in the tradition of [[fable]]s and [[Folklore|folk tale]]s. Usually, there is a lesson learned, and with some help from the audience, the hero/heroine saves the day. This kind of play uses [[stock character]]s seen in masque and again [[commedia dell'arte]], these characters include the villain (doctore), the clown/servant (Arlechino/Harlequin/buttons), the lovers etc. These plays usually have an emphasis on [[moral dilemma]]s, and good always triumphs over evil, this kind of play is also very entertaining making it a very effective way of reaching many people.

Pantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture dating back to classical theatre. It developed partly from the 16th century [[commedia dell'arte]] tradition of Italy, as well as other European and British stage traditions, such as 17th-century [[masque]]s and [[music hall]].&lt;ref name=Reid/&gt; An important part of the pantomime, until the late 19th century, was the [[harlequinade]].&lt;ref name=HistoryIBY&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/Factsheets/The%20History%20of%20Pantomime.pdf "The History of Pantomime"], It's-Behind-You.com, 2002, accessed 10 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Britain the word "pantomime" is usually used to mean '''[[Mime artist|miming]]''', rather than the theatrical form discussed here.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Webster's New World Dictionary]]'', World Publishing Company, 2nd College Edition, 1980, p. 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mime==
[[Mime artist|Mime]] is a theatrical medium where the action of a story is told through the movement of the body, without the use of speech. Performance of mime occurred in [[Ancient Greece]], and the word is taken from a single masked dancer called ''Pantomimus'', although their performances were not necessarily silent.&lt;ref&gt;Gutzwiller (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Medieval]] Europe, early forms of mime, such as [[Mummers Play|mummer play]]s and later [[dumbshow]]s, evolved. In the early nineteenth century [[Paris]], [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]] solidified the many attributes that we have come to know in modern times, including the silent figure in whiteface.&lt;ref&gt;Rémy (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Copeau]], strongly influenced by [[Commedia dell'arte]] and Japanese [[Noh]] theatre, used masks in the training of his actors. [[Étienne Decroux]], a pupil of his, was highly influenced by this and started exploring and developing the possibilities of mime and refined [[corporeal mime]] into a highly sculptural form, taking it outside of the realms of [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]]. [[Jacques Lecoq]] contributed significantly to the development of mime and [[physical theatre]] with his training methods.&lt;ref name=Callery&gt;Callery (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballet==
While some ballet emphasises "the lines and patterns of movement itself" dramatic dance "expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [https://www.britannica.com/art/dance/Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; Such ballets are theatrical works that have characters and "tell a story",&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; Dance movements in ballet "are often closely related to everyday forms of physical expression, [so that] there is an expressive quality inherent in nearly all dancing", and this is used to convey both action and emotions; mime is also used.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'', which tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse, [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ballet ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', based on Shakespeare's famous play, and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', which tells tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets.

== Creative drama ==
Creative drama includes dramatic activities and games used primarily in educational settings with children. Its roots in the United States began in the early 1900s. [[Winifred Ward]] is considered to be the founder of creative drama in education, establishing the first academic use of drama in Evanston, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich (1974, 75–80).&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest form of [[India]]n drama was the [[Sanskrit drama]].&lt;ref name="RSZ12"&gt;Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1st century AD and the 10th was a period of relative peace in the [[history of India]] during which hundreds of plays were written.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 70) and Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquests]] that began in the 10th and 11th centuries, theatre was discouraged or forbidden entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 72) and Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in an attempt to re-assert indigenous values and ideas, village theatre was encouraged across the subcontinent, developing in a large number of regional languages from the 15th to the 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 72), Richmond (1998, 516), and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Indian theatre developed during the [[British Raj|period of colonial rule]] under the [[British Empire]], from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1998, 516) and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sanskrit theatre====
{{Main|Sanskrit drama}}
The earliest-surviving fragments of [[Sanskrit drama]] date from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 516–517).&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516"&gt;Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient ''[[Vedas]]'' ([[hymn]]s from between 1500 and 1000 BC that are among the earliest examples of [[History of literature#India|literature]] in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of [[dialogue]]) and the [[ritual]]s of the [[Vedic period]] do not appear to have developed into theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516"/&gt; The ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'' by [[Patañjali]] contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.&lt;ref name="Richmond517"&gt;Richmond (1998, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise on [[grammar]] from 140 BC provides a feasible date for the beginnings of [[theatre in India]].&lt;ref name="Richmond517"/&gt;

The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is ''[[Natyashastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' (''Nātyaśāstra''), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BC to 200 AD) and whose authorship is attributed to [[Bharata Muni]]. The ''Treatise'' is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses [[acting]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]], architecture, [[Costume design|costuming]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account of the origin of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond517"/&gt;

Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of [[Sanskrit literature]].&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii"&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii).&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised [[stock character]]s, such as the hero (''nayaka''), heroine (''nayika''), or clown (''vidusaka''). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. It was patronized by the kings as well as village assemblies. Famous early playwrights include [[Bhasa]], [[Kalidasa]] (famous for ''[[Vikramōrvaśīyam|Vikrama and Urvashi]]'', ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram|Malavika and Agnimitra]]'', and ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|The Recognition of Shakuntala]]''), [[Śudraka]] (famous for ''[[Mṛcchakatika|The Little Clay Cart]]''), [[Asvaghosa]], [[Daṇḍin]], and [[Harsha|Emperor Harsha]] (famous for ''[[Nagananda]]'', ''[[Ratnavali]],'' and ''[[Priyadarsika]]''). ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|Śakuntalā]]'' (in English translation) influenced [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1808–1832).&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii"/&gt;

====Modern Indian drama====
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
[[Rabindranath Tagore]] was a pioneering modern playwright who wrote plays noted for their exploration and questioning of nationalism, identity, spiritualism and material greed.&lt;ref name="Banham1051"&gt;Banham (1998, 1051).&lt;/ref&gt; His plays are written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and include ''Chitra'' (''Chitrangada'', 1892), ''The King of the Dark Chamber'' (''Raja'', 1910), ''[[The Post Office (play)|The Post Office]]'' (''Dakghar'', 1913), and ''Red Oleander'' (''Raktakarabi'', 1924).&lt;ref name="Banham1051"/&gt;
[[Girish Karnad]] is a noted playwright, who has written a number of plays that use history and mythology, to critique and problematize ideas and ideals that are of contemporary relevance. Karnad's numerous plays such as ''Tughlaq'', ''Hayavadana'', ''[[Taledanda]]'', and ''Naga-Mandala'' are significant contributions to Indian drama. [[Vijay Tendulkar]] and [[Mahesh Dattani]] are amongst the major Indian playwrights of the 20th century. Mohan Rakesh in Hindi and [[Danish Iqbal]] in Urdu are considered architects of new age Drama. Mohan Rakesh's Aadhe Adhoore and Danish Iqbal's ''Dara Shikoh'' are considered modern classics.

====Modern Urdu drama of India and Pakistan====
{{Original research|section|date=December 2011}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
Urdu Drama evolved from the prevailing dramatic traditions of North India shaping Rahas or Raas as practiced by exponents like [[Nawab Wajid Ali Shah]] (1822 – 1887) of [[Awadh]]. His dramatic experiments led to the famous [[Inder Sabha]] of Amanat and later this tradition took the shape of Parsi Theatre. Agha Hashr Kashmiri is the culmination of this tradition.

Urdu theatre tradition has greatly influenced modern [[Indian theatre]]. Theatre has flourished in [[Urdu]] (which was called [[Hindi]] by early writers), along with [[Gujarati language|Gujrati]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. Urdu drama has had an important influence on [[Hindi film industry|Bombay Film industry]] and all the early works of Urdu theatre (performed by Parsi Companies) were made into films. Urdu dramatic tradition has existed for more than a 100 years.

Prof Hasan, Ghulam Jeelani, J.N,Kaushal, Shameem Hanfi, Jameel Shaidayi, etc. belong to the old generation, contemporary writers like Danish Iqbal, Sayeed Alam, Shahid Anwar, Iqbal Niyazi, and Anwar are a few [[postmodern]] playwrights actively contributing in the field of Urdu Drama.

Sayeed Alam is known for his wit and humour and more particularly for plays like 'Ghalib in New Delhi', 'Big B' and many other works, which are regularly staged for large audiences. ''Maulana Azad'' is his most important play both for its content and style.

Danish Iqbal's play ''[[Dara Shikoh]]'' directed by [[M. S. Sathyu]] is a modern classic that uses newer theatre techniques and a contemporary perspective. His other plays are ''[[Sahir]]''. on the famous lyricist and revolutionary poet. ''Kuchh Ishq kiya Kuchh Kaam'' is another play written by Danish which is basically a Celebration of [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz|Faiz]]'s poetry, featuring events from the early part of his life, particularly the events and incidents of pre-partition days which shaped his life and ideals. ''Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan'' – another play inspired from Faiz's letters written from various jails during the [[Rawalpindi Conspiracy]] days. He has written 14 other plays including ''Dilli Jo Ek Shehr Thaa'' and ''Main Gaya Waqt Nahin hoon''. Shahid's ''Three B'' is also a significant play. He has been associated with many groups like 'Natwa' and others. Zaheer Anwar has kept the flag of Urdu theatre flying in [[Kolkata]]. Unlike the writers of previous generation Sayeed, Shahid, Danish Iqbal and Zaheer do not write bookish plays but their work is a product of performing tradition. Iqbal Niyazi of [[Mumbai]] has written several plays in Urdu, his play ''AUR KITNE JALYANWALA BAUGH?'' won a National award other awards. Hence this is the only generation after Amanat and Agha Hashr who actually write for stage and not for libraries.

===China===
{{Main article|Theatre of China}}
[[File:1958 CPA 2262.jpg|thumb|A 1958 [[U.S.S.R.]] [[postage stamp]] commemorating [[Guan Hanqing]], one of the great Chinese dramatists, who is renowned for his "[[zaju]]" plays.]]

Chinese theatre has a long and complex history. Today it is often called [[Chinese opera]] although this normally refers specifically to the popular form known as [[Beijing opera]] and [[Kunqu]]; there have been many other forms of theatre in China, such as [[zaju]].

===Japan===
{{Main article|Theatre of Japan}}
Japanese [[Noh|Nō drama]] is a serious dramatic form that combines drama, music, and dance into a complete aesthetic performance experience. It developed in the 14th and 15th centuries and has its own musical instruments and performance techniques, which were often handed down from father to son. The performers were generally male (for both male and female roles), although female amateurs also perform Nō dramas. Nō drama was supported by the government, and particularly the military, with many military commanders having their own troupes and sometimes performing themselves. It is still performed in Japan today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iijnet.or.jp/NOH-KYOGEN/english/english.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050715090014/http://www.iijnet.or.jp/NOH-KYOGEN/english/english.html| archivedate=2005-07-15| accessdate=2013-02-27| deadurl=yes| title=Background to Noh-Kyogen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kyōgen]] is the comic counterpart to Nō drama. It concentrates more on dialogue and less on music, although Nō instrumentalists sometimes appear also in Kyōgen. [[Kabuki]] drama, developed from the 17th century, is another comic form, which includes dance.

[[Image:EWIS.jpg|thumb|right|Types of External cromatic 
 wall insulation systems (EWI Systems pictured above)]]

An '''external wall insulation''' system (or EWIS) is a thermally insulated, protective, decorative exterior [[cladding (construction)|cladding]] procedure involving the use of expanded [[polystyrene]], [[mineral wool]], polyurethane foam or phenolic foam, topped off with a reinforced cement based, mineral or synthetic finish and [[plaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.maloneassociatesltd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/The-Risky-Business-of-Covering-Up.pdf|title = The risky business of covering up|last = Malone|first = Joe|date = 1 December 2013|journal = Construction, Research and Innovation Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thickness of thermal insulation is dependent on whatever type is required in order to create a partition with a heat [[transmission factor]] of U=0.25-0.3 W/m2K. When calculating the actual insulation requirements, consideration must be given to current Building Regulation standards. Consideration must also be given to exposure and durability, and whether the structure might be subjected to vandalism etc. In many older properties, special attention is required for concrete beams or lintels which act as [[thermal bridges]] providing poor insulation.

==Types==

External wall insulation systems generally comprise firstly an insulation layer (an element which helps to achieve the requisite thermal performance); and secondly,a protected weatherproof finish (usually a [[Stucco|render]], although brick slips, tiles, and decorative boards can also be used). Insulating render can also be an advantage in certain locations. Choice of types and sizes will depend on the substrate and design exposure requirements.

Dry finishes are usually fixed to the substrate by means of timber [[batten]]s independently fixed to the substrate.

Any system selected and installed, should be certified by a notified body.

===Traditional finishes===

A selection of traditional finishes is currently utilised within the external wall insulation industry. Dry-dash render is a traditional render application commonly used. By this method, dry dashing aggregate is thrown onto the wet render to create a natural aggregate finish. Available in a wide variety of colours, sizes and textures, the practice is relatively cheap. Manufactured aggregates such as ceramics and glass can be used for more specialised projects, but the costs will be greater than for projects using natural aggregates.

Scratch plaster render is a coloured cementitious render scratched while the surface is still workable, but after the initial setting has taken place. The surface of the render is removed by the action of the scratching tool, and approximately {{convert|2|to|3|mm}} of render are removed exposing the open matrix of the aggregate mix. The true colour of the render is exposed with a light even texture.

Rough-cast render consists of a top-coat render and aggregate mix thrown onto a backing coat in a [[slurry]] form, the aggregate being totally encapsulated within the cementitious slurry. The aggregate may be any hard stone of an equal graded size to suit the particular application and creates a “lumpy texture” finish. This method is traditionally widely used in Scotland.

An innovation is the inclusion of [[silicone]] water-proofers in pre-blended and pre-packed proprietary renders. This development increases the specification and capabilities of polymer renders, particularly for exposed or coastal areas. It is applied in the conventional manner and is now readily available in all the usual colours.

Tyrolean finishes are sprayed cementitious mixes, pre-coloured and applied by a hand-held machine. This finish is widely used throughout the UK as an economical, easily applied colourful finish for all forms of building type. It has medium-term durability under average conditions.{{vague|date=May 2011}}

Smooth/painted finishes consist of masonry paint, and are applied to a good rendered surface to give a smooth coloured effect, free of the imperfections that the more natural aggregate finishes can sometimes deliver. A very wide selection of light colours are available.

Textured coatings are applied by roller or trowel to an approximate thickness of {{convert|1.5|to|3|mm}}, and are usually [[Acrylate polymer|acrylic]] or silicone-based for waterproofing and long term durability. They produce an even, flat-textured, finish.

Acrylic variants are easily applied, and are considered “high performance” finishes. Some cheaper variants might result in the loss [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of surface brightness over a relatively short life span. High quality acrylics can provide a longer term durability, colour stability, and crack resistance compared to polymer cement finishes. Acrylic variants are available in a very wide range of colours.

Silicone variants are more resistant to marine environments than acrylics, as they have superior water resistance, but they can be more costly, and come in a smaller range of colours.

Brick slips are a thin facing applied over an insulant to provide a traditional “brick” wall finish. Slips can either be manufactured by [[extrusion]] or cut from real bricks. Specialist waterproof coloured pointing mortars are used to complete the effect. Commercially available brick slip systems have been developed to include support for the brick slip finish, certified by [[BBA/BRE]]. The brick slips usually have a size of about 210-240 x 50-71 x 20&amp;nbsp;mm (length x height x width).&lt;ref&gt;Klinkerriemchen / The size from Brick slips [http://www.renowall.de/klinkerriemchen.php "Klinkerriemchen / Brick slips"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Simulated brick renders can also be replicated in coloured polymer to a high standard. Two coloured layers of polymer-modified external cementitious render are applied in {{convert|3|to|4|mm}} layers onto a coloured backing. The “brick” pattern is cut into the top layer, exposing an under-layer of differing colour representing the cement joints.

Simulated stone renders are made from coloured [[polymer]]. Two coloured layers of polymer-modified external cementitious render are applied in {{convert|3|to|4|mm}} layers onto a specified backing. The “stone” pattern is cut into the top layer exposing an under-layer of differing colour to represent the cement joints.

[[Terracotta]] tiles are usually of clay burnt material imported from Europe. These proprietary systems are secured by a system of extruded aluminium rail systems fixed securely to the substrate with insulation material inserted within the void. Special pressed metal profiles and [[Lock (water transport)#Cill|cills]] are added to make them waterproof.

Timber boards, aluminium or [[PVC]] “sidings” can be installed over insulation to provide additional alternatives to the traditional render and applied finishes. The boards are usually of [[shiplap]] profile, and either [[cedar wood|cedar]] or treated [[softwood]]. Aluminium or PVC systems are also available as alternatives.

Traditional tile hanging finishes can be applied onto conventional timber support structures and insulated with the required type and thickness of insulation. Suitable consideration has to be given to ventilation passages to avoid [[interstitial condensation]].

==Reducing Carbon Emissions==
With the UK aiming to reduce its carbon emissions by 80% by the year 2050,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reducing the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-the-uk-s-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-80-by-2050|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the British government has offered up to £6,000 cashback to homeowners who install EWI at their solid wall property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Deal: energy saving for your home|url=https://www.gov.uk/green-deal-energy-saving-measures/get-money-back-from-the-green-deal-home-improvement-fund|website=Department of Energy and Climate Change|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Wales, where the housing stock is in particular need of being updated to become energy efficient, has seen a surge in applications for this scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dobson|first1=Ben|title=High take up of external wall insulation in Swansea|url=http://www.sbmenergyservices.co.uk/blog/high-take-up-of-external-wall-insulation-in-swansea|website=SBM Energy Services|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

External wall insulation is a great and confirmed way to reduce energy usage needed to heat up the building. Installing it is a part of and [[eco home]] or [[carbon neutral home]] idea.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.kanler.com/2015/03/13/going-green-easy-on-the-planet-and-your-wallet/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product Requirements==
Particular product requirements need to be met such as the external wall insulation product reaching a particular u-value in order to make the building sufficiently thermally insulated and therefore be used for a green deal project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alumasc Exterior Building Products Product Datasheets|url=http://www.alumascfacades.co.uk/downloads/product-datasheets/|website=Alumasc Facades|accessdate=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dampness==
The application of External Wall Insulation can help to deal with rain penetration problems through solid walls by blocking wind-driven rain. However, it can also make the problem worse if poor detailing (e.g. around eaves) allows water to pass behind the external wall insulation where it can become trapped. A high standard of design and installation should therefore be insisted upon. The dangers of not adequately designing and specifying these systems is dealt with in a research paper written by Joe Malone and published in the CIOB's Construction, Research and Innovation Journal (Volume 4, Issue 4, Dec 2013 The Risky Business of Covering Up)

External Wall Insulation should only be applied to walls that do not suffer from [[Damp (structural)|pre-existing dampness problems]]. The Energy Saving Trust give the following advice.&lt;ref name="Choosing external wall insulation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Insulation/Solid-wall-insulation/Choosing-external-wall-insulation|website=energysavingtrust.org.uk|publisher=Energy Saving Trust|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"The main damp issue to be avoided with external wall insulation is rising damp. If you already have a problem with this, then it will have to be fixed before the insulation is fitted, otherwise you run the risk of trapping the damp inside the wall structure and so making the problem worse."''

'''Feminist ethics''' is an approach to [[ethics]] that builds on the belief that traditionally ethical theorizing has under-valued and/or under-appreciated [[women]]'s [[moral]] experience, which is largely male dominated, and it therefore chooses to re imagine ethics through a holistic [[feminist]] approach to transform it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-ethics/ Tong, R. and Williams N., Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Feminist Ethics, First published Tue May 12, 1998; substantive revision Mon May 4, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Feminist [[philosophers]] critique traditional ethics as pre-eminently focusing on men's [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] with little regard for women's viewpoints. Caring and the [[moral]] issues of private life and family responsibilities were traditionally regarded as trivial matters. Generally, women are portrayed as ethically immature and shallow in comparison to men. Traditional ethics prizes masculine cultural traits like "independence, autonomy, intellect, will, wariness, hierarchy, domination, culture, transcendence, product, asceticism, war, and death,"&lt;ref name="Jaggar, Feminist Ethics, 1992"&gt;Jaggar, "Feminist Ethics," 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and gives less weight to culturally [[feminine]] traits like "interdependence, community, connection, sharing, emotion, body, trust, absence of hierarchy, nature, immanence, process, joy, peace, and life."&lt;ref name="Jaggar, Feminist Ethics, 1992"/&gt; Should women embody or use any traditionally masculine cultural traits they are seen as other or as an attempt to be more like men.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hooks, B. (1994). Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom, New York:Routledge. Google Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional ethics has a "male" orientated convention in which moral reasoning is viewed through a framework of rules, rights, universality, and impartiality and becomes the standard of a society. The "female" approaches to moral reasoning emphasizes relationships, responsibilities, particularity, and partiality.&lt;ref name="Jaggar, Feminist Ethics, 1992"/&gt;

==Historical background==
Feminist ethics developed from [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s '[[Vindication of the Rights of Women]]' published in 1792.&lt;ref name="womhist.alexanderstreet.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Abruzzese|first1 =Jaclyn|last2 =Brayne|first2=Allison|last3 = Shastri|first3 = Julie |last4 = Sakofsky|first4 = Rachel|last5 = Hewitt|first5= Nancy|last6 = Sklar |first6 = Kathryn|date = Spring 2002|url = http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/awrm/intro.htm|title = From Wollstonecraft to Mill: What British and European Ideas and Social Movements Influenced the Emergence of Feminism in the Atlantic World, 1792-1869?|website = Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600-2000| publisher = Alexander Street Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the new ideas from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], individual feminists being able to travel more than ever before, generating more opportunities for the exchange of ideas and advancement of women's rights.&lt;ref name="docsouth.unc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Jennifer L.|title=The Mothers of a Movement: Remembering 19th-Century Feminists|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/highlights/feminists.html|website=Documenting the American South|publisher=The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; With new [[social movements]] like [[Romanticism]] there developed unprecedented optimistic outlook on human capacity and destiny. This optimism was reflected in [[John Stuart Mill]]'s essay [[The Subjection of Women]] (1869).&lt;ref name="womhist.alexanderstreet.com"/&gt; Feminist approaches to ethics, were further developed around this period by other notable people like [[Catherine Beecher]], [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Lucretia Mott]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] with an emphasis on the gendered nature of [[morality]], specifically related to 'women's morality'.&lt;ref name="docsouth.unc.edu"/&gt;

===Charlotte Perkins Gilman===
The American writer and sociologist [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] imagined a fictional "[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]". In this male-free society, women produce their daughters through [[parthenogenesis]] and live a superior morality. This women-centered society valued both industriousness and motherhood while discouraged individualistic competitive approaches to life. Gilman thought that in such a scenario women could relate cooperatively as there would be no requirement to dominate each other. Herland cultivates and combines the best "feminine" virtues and the best "masculine" virtues together as co-extensive with human [[virtue]]. If a society  wants to be virtuous, according to Gilman, it should exemplify the fictional utopia of Herland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Gilman|first = Charlotte Perkins |title = Herland|url = https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gilman/charlotte_perkins/herland/|date =1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; However so long as women are [[Codependence|dependent]] on men for economic support, women will continue to be known for their servility and men for their arrogance. Women need to be men's economic equals before they can develop truly human moral virtue, this is a perfect blend of pride and humility that we call [[self-respect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Gilman| first = Charlotte Perkins| title = Women and Economics|location = Boston|publisher = Small, Maynard, &amp; Co.|date = 1898|url = http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/gilman/economics/economics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist care ethics==
{{main|Ethics of care}}
[[Carol Gilligan]] and [[Nel Noddings]] are exponents of a feminist care ethics which criticize traditional ethics as deficient to the degree they lack, disregard, trivialize or attack women's cultural values and virtues.&lt;ref name="Noddings, N. 1984"&gt;Noddings, N., Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th-century feminist ethicists developed a variety of care focused feminist approaches to ethics in comparison to non-feminist care-focused approaches to ethics, feminist ones tend to appreciate the impact of gender issues more fully.&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, C., In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press., 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist care-focused ethicists note the tendencies of patriarchal societies not to appreciate the value and benefits of women's ways of loving, thinking, working and writing and tend to view females as subordinate.&lt;ref name="Noddings, N. 1984"/&gt; This is why some social studies make a conscious effort to adopt feminist ethics, rather than just the traditional ethics of studies. An example of this was Roffee and Waling's 2016 study into microaggressions against the LGBTIQ community. Even though it was focused on the LGBTIQ community the feminist ethics were better suited, as they are more considerate to the vulnerabilities and needs of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306325028|title=James Roffee &amp; Andrea Waling Resolving ethical challenges when researching with minority and vulnerable populations: LGBTIQ victims of violence, harassment and bullying}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical fields also fail to recognize that ethics plays an often negative part in the LGBTIQ community in how they receive treatment and what treatments are given as options to them. As well a how women are also treated within medical fields.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohrmann|first=M|date=2015|title=Feminist Ethics and Religious|url=|journal=Journal of Religious Ethics|volume=43(2)|pages=185-192|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist justice ethics==
{{Main|Feminist justice ethics}}
[[Feminist justice ethics]] is a feminist view on morality which seeks to engage with, and ultimately transform, traditional universal approaches to [[ethics]].&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 68"&gt;Hutchings, Kimberley. "Ethics." In ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'', edited by Laura J Shepherd, 68. New York: Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like most types of feminist ethics, feminist justice ethics looks at how gender is left out of mainstream ethical considerations.  Mainstream ethics are argued to be male-oriented.  However, feminist justice ethics does differ considerably from other feminist ethics.  A universal set of ethics is a significant part of feminist justice ethics &lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 69"&gt;Hutchings, Kimberley. "Ethics." In ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'', edited by Laura J Shepherd, 69. New York: Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;but depending on the geographical location, such as the difference between the Global North and Global South, may differ in how justice is applied and may change what is considered justice. Feminist justice ethics is clear in dividing "thick" morality from "thin" morality.  Other ethical approaches that define themselves by differentiating groups from one another through culture or other phenomena are regarded as "thick" accounts of morality.  Feminist justice ethics claims that "thick" accounts of morality, as opposed to "thin" accounts of morality, are intrinsically prone to eroding valid feminist critique.&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 68"/&gt;

==Feminist ethics and the future==
Feminist ethicists believe there is an obligation for women's differing points of view to be heard and then to fashion an inclusive consensus view from them. To attempt to achieve this and to push towards gender equality with men together is the goal of feminist ethics. The fixing of these issues are important in modern times because of the shifting view points as well as what has considered to be 'ethical' in terms of treatment and how women, in particular, women's bodies should be treated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

"The goal of feminist ethics is the transformation of societies and situations where women are harmed through violence, subordination and exclusion. When such injustices are evident now and in the future, radical feminist activists will continue their work of protest and action following careful appraisal and reflection"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLellan|first1=Betty|title=Unspeakable: A feminist ethic of speech|date=February 2010|publisher=OtherWise Publications|isbn=978-0-646-51778-0|page=240|url=http://feministagenda.org.au/home/otherwise-publications/unspeakable/}}&lt;/ref&gt; With violence, it once again circles back to masculine behavior and traditional ethics that such behavior and treatment was encourages. In today's society, the twentieth century, it is becoming less socially acceptable to commit violence against women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Feminist ethics and International Relations ==
{{Main|Feminism (international relations)}}
{{Feminism sidebar |theory}}
Feminist theories and that of ethics broaden the scope of the predominantly masculine sphere of International Relations. This is especially important for issues of the private realm to take stage into the public which includes issues such as children's rights, gender violence and discrimination, gender relations in war torn societies, and other similar issues which remain difficult to appear relevant in the mainstream discussions of ethics in international relations. The feminist dialogues of ethics are almost inescapably present to the private realm and are known to only shadow dominant 'male' paradigms of ethics in the public realm. This is especially a reality in discussion of ethics in International Relations where it is predominantly built on a language of violence, technologies or economics and what are known to be the masculine topics of discussion.

See '''Kimberly Hutchings''' discussion in "Ethics" for further detail on the foundations of the theory in International Relations  &lt;ref&gt;Hutchings, Kimberly. "Ethics ." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . 2009 . 61-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selection of Authors and applied theory  in International Relations ===
{{Split|Overview of Feminist Ethics Scholars|date=November 2018}}
'''Alison Watson''' &lt;ref&gt;"Children Born of Wartime Rape: Rights and Representations ." International Feminist Journal of Politics (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson discusses the issue of children born of wartime rape and uses feminist theory of ethics in addressing these marginalized issues. The invisibility is emphasized in the traditional construction within much of the existing international discourse of motherhood as a 'private sphere activity'   where important focused issues such as children of wartime rape can be lost in translation of international dialogue and minimally touched upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Alison|title=Children Born of Wartime Rape: RIghts and Representations|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|year=2007|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist theory of ethics is provided in terms of broadening theoretical dialogues of international relations and addressing issues that remain marginalized.

'''Puechguirbal''' &lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that failure to broaden the current scope of ethics in peacekeeping operations and rebuilding strategies, surrounding arms and violence, results in failing to meet the needs of both men and women. Puechguirbal argues that conflict is a 'gendered experience' and discusses the importance of peacekeeping operations keeping in check the differential impacts of war on women, men, boys and girls in post conflict society so as to not further marginalize the most vulnerable groups of the population&lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009: 171&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, peacekeeping operations are heavily masculine in the sense that security revolves around the cessation of hostilities and disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009: 163&lt;/ref&gt; Peacebuilding operations must shift the focus from solely disarming and cessation of hostilities against gang members to social constructions of violence against women, men, and children that is embedded in societies broken apart by conflict. Gender issues have not been part of mandates of peacekeeping missions&lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009:170&lt;/ref&gt; and  urges women to take a more active role in political processes in post-conflict reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009:163&lt;/ref&gt; Applying Feminist ethics in peacekeeping and re-building strategies can reach a wider range of issues as well as deemed not of dire importance in dialogues of International Relations. Current strategies are not reaching target goals of generating peace and cessation of   gender violence and sexual abuses that continue to reach high levels in incidences. This remains a residue of post-conflict societies that must be addressed. Implementing feminist ethics generates greater peacekeeping and peacebuilding strategies for gendered strategies to meet the needs of both genders so as to be implemented into not only the institutions but society.

== Feminist ethics and Being Transgender. ==
When applying feminist ethics and care, it is important to consider in what way does that apply to those who are transgender, either Female to Male or Male to Female. As there is a historical with ethics being deeply rooted in religious ethics. For those who are transgender and wish to be identified as their preferred gender have to apply either masculine or feminine ethics in both appearance and thinking to pass. One notable mention is when “Halberstam claims that surgical intervention in the case of “sex-change” serves to “fictionalize” gender (i.e., render or expose as artificial) … a masculine performing butch lesbian, for example…”&lt;ref&gt;•	Halberstam, Judith, 1994, “F2M: The making of female masculinity”, in ''The lesbian postmodern'', Laura Doan (ed.), New York: Columbia University Press, 210–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 2010, the only [[flag]] used to represent [[New Caledonia]], an overseas territory of France, was the [[flag of France]], a [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolor]] featuring three vertical bands coloured [[blue]] ([[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|hoist side]]), [[white]], and [[red]] known to English speakers as the '''French Tricolour''' or simply the '''Tricolour'''. However, in July 2010 the [[Congress of New Caledonia]] voted in favour of a wish to fly the [[Kanak people|Kanak]] flag alongside the French tricolor.&lt;ref name="congress"&gt;[http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/pacifique/ncal-voeu-drapeau2010.htm Transcript from the official text in french, see discussion for a translated version]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voeux"&gt;[http://www.juridoc.gouv.nc/JuriDoc/jdJ201.nsf/JoncP/2010-06341/$File/2010-6341.pdf?OpenElement&amp;root=2010&amp;page=6341 Voeux n° 1 du treize juillet 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Two official flags of New Caledonia on same flagpole.png|thumb|left|Official flags side by side on the same flagpole, Nouméa, March 2011.]]
In 2008 the government of New Caledonia debated the introduction of an official regional flag and anthem, as required by the [[Nouméa Accord|Accord de Nouméa]]. A flag in fairly widespread unofficial use was the flag of the [[Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front]] (FLNKS), a political party favoring independence for New Caledonia, but the French tricolor would remain the only flag used for the next two years.

In July 2010 the [[Congress of New Caledonia]] voted in favour of a wish to fly the [[Kanak people|Kanak]] flag alongside the French tricolor in the territory.&lt;ref name="voeux"/&gt;&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;  On 17 July 2010, French Prime minister [[François Fillon]] took part in a ceremony in Nouméa where the FLNKS flag was hoisted alongside the French tricolor.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |first=Bonnie|last=Malkin|title=New Caledonia adopts second flag in compromise over French rule |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/newcaledonia/7900494/New-Caledonia-adopts-second-flag-in-compromise-over-French-rule.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher= |date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flnks flag"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2010/07/17/01002-20100717ARTFIG00310-fillon-hisse-les-drapeaux-francais-et-kanak-a-noumea.php |title=FLNKS flag |language=French |date=17 July 2010 |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the debate on finding a permanent official regional flag continued.

The adoption of the Kanak flag proved controversial.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; Some New Caledonians argued for a completely new flag for New Caledonia, which would incorporate designs from both the French tricolor and the Kanak flags.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; Such new flag would aim to promote a "common destiny" for ethnic Kanaks and ethnic French residents in New Caledonia.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

==FLNKS political flag==
The FLNKS flag, first adopted by the party in 1980, is composed of three horizontal stripes of [[blue]] ([[Pantone]] 286c), [[red]] (Pantone 032c) and [[green]] (Pantone 347c) charged with a [[yellow]] (Pantone 102c) disc of a diameter two-thirds the height of the flag centered at a position of one-third the width of the flag, measured from the hoist side.  The disc is fibrated [[black]] and defaced with a vertical symbol, also black.

The blue symbolizes both the sky and more importantly the ocean surrounding New Caledonia.  The red symbolizes the blood shed by the [[Kanak people|Kanaks]] in their struggle for [[independence]], [[socialism]], and unity.  The green symbolizes the land itself and by extension the ancestors buried within it.  The yellow disc is a representation of the sun and the symbol upon it consists of a ''[[Flèche faîtière|flèche faitière]]'', a kind of arrow that adorns the roofs of Kanak houses thrust through ''tutut'' shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/nc%7Dflnks.html|title=Front de Libération National Kanak Socialist (Political party, New Caledonia)|date=2014-04-27|accessdate=2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provincial flags==
New Caledonia is divided into three provinces, each with its own flag.

'''Jan Leopold Tyranowski''' (9 February 1901 – 15 March 1947) was a [[Polish people|Polish]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://catholicsaints.info/venerable-jan-leopold-tyranowski/|title=Venerable Jan Leopold Tyranowsi|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an ardent admirer and follower of the [[Discalced Carmelite]] charism – but was not of their order – and was a central figure in the [[spiritual formation]] of Karol Józef Wojtyła who became [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref name=AT&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://aleteia.org/2017/01/07/how-a-tailor-in-nazi-occupied-territory-brought-the-world-a-pope/|title=How a tailor in Nazi-occupied territory brought the world a pope|publisher=Aleteia|date=7 January 2017|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was both the leader and student mentor of his friend's college parish of Saint Stanisław Kostka in the 1940s as well as a small group he ran on the behalf of the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] during the wartime period.&lt;ref name=CW&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Blog/5392/a_papal_tutor_of_heroic_virtue.aspx|title=A papal tutor of heroic virtue|date=1 February 2017|publisher=The Catholic World Report|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/94434|title=Venerable Jan Leopold Tyranowski|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His old friend launched the beatification process on 28 April 1997 and titled him as a [[Servant of God]] while the confirmation of his [[heroic virtue]] at the beginning of 2017 allowed for [[Pope Francis]] to title him as [[Venerable]].

==Life==
Jan Leopold Tyranowski was born on 9 February 1901 in Kraków to Jan Tyranowski and Apolonia Hrobak.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;

His father had plans for him and directing him to the [[accounting profession]] which he studied for. He obtained his high school diploma to enter accounting but this was something cut short in 1930 when he suffered from a chronic and debilitating stomach ailment that forced him to quit. He began to work in his father's tailor shop and inherited it after his death and so made this the focus of his life alongside his mother who aided him.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; When he assumed tailoring his stress reduced and he seemed to become much happier and active in his parish. He liked to be a loner and kept to himself and never married nor had children; he liked taking photos as well as gardening and had an avid interest in science and foreign languages.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; In 1935 he attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and listened to a sermon a [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian priest]] gave that would forever change his life and broaden his spiritual horizons. The priest said in the sermon that "it is not difficult to become a saint" and this had a profound impact on his own thinking on what it meant to be a saint and aspire for [[Universal call to holiness|personal holiness]]. He became an ardent admirer and devotee to [[Saint John of the Cross]] and [[Saint Teresa of Ávila]] after reading their spiritual writings and he soon became enthralled with the [[Carmelite]] charism despite never joining them as a religious or secular member.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt;

At the end of May 1941 one of the last Salesian priests asked him to assume control of a religious group of men and he accepted this and organized meetings of fifteen teenagers or young adults and called them "Living Rosary" groups.&lt;ref name=CW/&gt; He continued the meetings in his apartment during the war and aided the Salesians whenever possible during the war due to an extensive number of them being apprehended as prisoners. The [[Gestapo]] even once discovered one such meeting but dismissed it as the gatherings of a religious fanatic. It was at these meetings that he first met Karol Józef Wojtyła – the future [[Pope John Paul II]] – in February or March 1940 during a retreat at the local parish.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Sometime in 1946 he fell ill with pulmonary tuberculosis and suffered great pain over the next several months due to the intensity of the disease that later claimed his life in 1947.&lt;ref name=CW/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; He managed to attend Wojtyła's [[ordination]] as a priest on 1 November 1946 just a few months before his death. He was first buried at the [[Rakowicki Cemetery]] but was exhumed on 26 March 1998 and was buried in the church of Saint Stanisław Kostka that the Salesians of Don Bosco manage in [[Dębniki, Kraków|Kraków's district of Dębniki]].&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=AT/&gt;

===Relationship with John Paul II===
The future pope found the man intense to an almost unbearable degree but soon came to see something of profound import in him. Later in life Wojtyła stated: "What he tried to teach us was new. He wanted to pull new listeners to this new life". The future pope went on to state that Tyranowski made the effort to teach them new things that were unknown to them or what people were unwilling to learn and accept. The future pope was also introduced to the writings of the [[Carmelite]] Saint John of the Cross after Tyranowski exposed him to it; John of the Cross would come to be one of the great inspirations in the life of Wojtyla.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt;&lt;ref name=CW/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was one of those unknown [[saint|saints]], hidden amid the others like a marvelous light at the bottom of life, at a depth where night usually reigns. He disclosed to me the riches of his inner life, of his mystical life. In his words, in his [[spirituality]] and in the example of a life given to God alone, he represented a new world that I did not yet know. I saw the beauty of a soul opened up by grace.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mieczyslaw Malinski]] – a friend of Wojtyła's and a member of Tyranowski's group who later became a [[priest]] was also skeptical at first about this religious eccentric but came to accept Tyranowski's teachings as something deep and insightful. Malinski stated later that "Jan's influence with [Karol] was gigantic. I can safely say that if it wasn't for him neither Wojtyla nor I would have become priests".&lt;ref name=AT/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Wojtyla wrote in May 1949:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This man was not a fiction or a symbol, but a real living person. His name was Tyranowski. Jan Tyranowski. He lived in [[Krakow]], in Debniki, at 15 Rozana Street. He was born in 1900 and died in March 1947 ... His family was of a typical suburban [[middle class]] ... It is worth noting that Jan’s demeanor, for example, the way he wore his watch, his expressions, all of the many details that reflect the social environment, were totally consistent with that environment. The entire difference was hidden within, and it was from within that all his external habits obtained their particular character. Jan guided his inner life according to the book "Mistyka" by Father Semenenko. Later, however, Saint John of the Cross and [[Thérèse of Lisieux|Saint Thérèse of the Child Jesus]] became his chief spiritual masters. They were not only his masters, they led him to discover himself, they explained and justified his own life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Beatification process==
The Salesians of Don Bosco – whom he aided during [[World War II]] – took charge of the cause for beatification. His old friend John Paul II started the beatification cause on 28 April 1997 after the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] issued the "[[nihil obstat]]" and titled him as a [[Servant of God]]. The diocesan process spanned from 30 September 1997 until 15 March 2000 when it closed and it later received C.C.S. validation on 16 November 2001 before the C.C.S. received the [[Positio]] dossier from the postulation in 2011.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The theologians met and approved the dossier's contents on 15 September 2015 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 17 January 2017. The confirmation of his life of [[heroic virtue]] allowed for [[Pope Francis]] to title him as [[Venerable]] on 20 January 2017.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The current [[postulator]] for the cause is the Salesian priest Pierluigi Cameroni while the previous postulator was the Salesian bishop [[Enrico dal Covolo]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Portrait by [[Boris Kustodiyev]] ([[Portrait of Chaliapin (Kustodiev painting)]]), 1921.]]
In [[sewing]] and [[tailor]]ing, a '''lining''' is an inner layer of [[fabric]], [[fur]], or other material inserted into [[clothing]], [[hat]]s, [[luggage]], [[curtain]]s, [[handbag]]s and similar items.

Linings provide a neat inside finish and conceal [[interfacing]], padding, the raw edges of [[seam (sewing)|seams]], and other construction details.  A lining reduces the wearing strain on clothing, extending the useful life of the lined garment.  A smooth lining allows a [[coat (clothing)|coat]] or [[jacket]] to slip on over other clothing easily, and linings add warmth to cold-weather wear.&lt;ref&gt;Editors of Creative Publishing (2005), pp. 24, 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaeffer (2007), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Linings are typically made of solid colors to coordinate with the garment [[textile|fabric]], but patterned and contrasting-colored linings are also used.  Designer [[Madeleine Vionnet]] introduced the ensemble in which the coat was lined in the fabric used for the dress worn with it,&lt;ref&gt;Brockman (1965), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; and this notion remains a characteristic of the [[Chanel]] suit, which often features a lining and blouse of the same fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Shaeffer (2007), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

In tailoring, home sewing, and [[ready-to-wear]] clothing construction, linings are usually completed as a unit before being fitted into the garment shell.  In [[haute couture]], the sleeves and body are usually lined separately before assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Shaeffer (2007), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Some specialized types of lining include the following:

==Interlining== 
This is an additional layer of fabric between the lining and the outer garment shell.  Insulating interlinings for winter garments are usually sewn to the individual lining pieces before the lining is assembled.&lt;ref&gt;Editors of Creative Publishing (2005), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial or half lining==
This type lines only the upper back and front of the garment, concealing the shoulder pads and interfacings,&lt;ref&gt;Editors of Creative Publishing (2005), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; with or without sleeves.

==Zip-in, zip-out, snap-out or button-in lining (sometimes called a "liner")== 
This is a warm removable lining for a jacket, coat, or [[raincoat]] that is held in place with a [[zipper]], [[snap fastener]]s, or [[buttons]].  Garments with removable linings are usually lined with a lightweight fabric as well, to provide a neat finish when the warm lining is not worn.

[[File:Hpan Khoun, the Jumping Game, Ye Myat Tun, Discover Myanmar.jpg|thumb|Children of Set Set Yo Village in Myanmar demonstrating the fifth and final round of [[Hpan Khone]], or "High Jump Game."  This traditional game is played by children in Myanmar.  A similar game called [[Luksong tinik]] is played by Pilipino children.]]

'''Luksong tinik''' (English: "jumping over thorns") is a popular game in the [[Philippines]]. It is originated in [[Cabanatuan]] city, Philippines, played by two teams with equal numbers of players. Each team designates a leader, the ''nanay'' (mother), while the rest of the players are called ''anak'' (children). The players chosen to be ''nanay'' are usually the ones who can jump the highest. The game involves players sitting on the ground and other players jumping over parts of their body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/filipino_games/luksong_tinik.htm|title= Luksong Tinik|accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Basically you just jump over people's feet which is meant to be the tinik which one foot/hand of the 2 players sitting on the ground will be added after all players have jumped the 1st round

In [[Myanmar]], this game is known as [[Hpan Khone]] and is played mostly by females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/sports/21011-the-encyclopedia-of-myanmar-games-volume-ii.html|title= The encyclopedia of Myanmar Games|accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are interesting former military sites in the [[Baltic states]], which used to be occupied by the [[Soviet Union]]. 

* [[Plokštinė missile base]], a former Soviet nuclear launch site in [[Žemaitija National Park]] (Samogitia National Park), [[Lithuania]]

== Sites in Nicaragua ==

* Former Battlefield site during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. The revolution involved a war campaign led by the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN) to violently oust the Somoza dictatorship in 1978–79. A strategic battle was campaigned on Colina (Hill) 155, located in [[O Parks, WildLife, and Recreation]], [[El Ostional]], [[Rivas, Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ni.geoview.info/colina_155,1951635385n|title=Colina 155, Rivas, Nicaragua|website=ni.geoview.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mudik''', or '''Pulang Kampung''', is an [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] term for the activity where migrants or migrant workers return to their hometown or village during or before major holidays, especially [[Lebaran]] ([[Eid al-Fitr]]).&lt;ref name="JPMudik"&gt;{{cite news |title = Lebaran and local pride in the annual ‘mudik’ custom | author = Donny Syofyan | date = 13 July 2015 | newspaper =The Jakarta Post| url =http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/07/13/lebaran-and-local-pride-annual-mudik-custom.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the mudik homecoming travel before Lebaran takes place in most Indonesian urban centers, the highlight is on the nation's largest urban agglomeration; [[Greater Jakarta]], as millions of Jakartans exit the city by various means of transportation, overwhelming train stations and airports and also clogging highways, especially the [[Trans-Java toll road]] and Java's [[North Coast Road (Java)|Northern Coast Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Mass exodus to begin in Jakarta this weekend | author = Callistasia Anggun Wijaya | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | location = Jakarta | date = 1 July 2016 | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/07/01/mass-exodus-to-begin-in-jakarta-this-weekend.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation of this homecoming tradition is of course to visit one's family, especially parents. However, people might seek to come to their hometown during this period to attend a rare opportunity: a gathering of members of the extended family, the seldomly seen relatives that are normally scattered in other cities, other provinces or even overseas.

Mudik for Eid al-Fitr, or its similar traditions, exists in countries with [[Muslim]] majorities, such as [[Indonesia]],  [[Malaysia]], [[Pakistan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =Cerita Mudik di Pakistan | date = 17 July 2015 |newspaper = Republika | url =http://www.republika.co.id/berita/internasional/global/15/07/17/nrm7eu-cerita-mudik-di-pakistan |language = Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [https://www.kaskus.co.id/thread/51fc9f233fcb172318000000 ''Tradisi Mudik di Bangladesh''], [[Kaskus]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar annual homecoming traditions are also observable in various parts of the world, including [[Chinese New Year]] in China, Thai [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]], [[Christmas]] in Europe, [[Divali]] in India and [[Thanksgiving]] in [[Americas|America]], where family members are expected to come home during these specific holidays.

== Etymology ==
The term ''mudik'' in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means "to sail or to travel to ''udik'' (upstream, inland) by the river".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Mudik | work = Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (KBBI) | url =http://kbbi.web.id/mudik |language =Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''mudik'' or ''udik'' is also found in local Indonesian languages, including [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Minangkabau language|Minang]], [[Betawi language|Betawi]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] languages.

== History ==
The tradition to visit one's hometown, home village or family ancestral home is not a new tradition in [[Indonesian history]]. Manuscripts dated from the [[Majapahit]] period describes that nobles and royals often travelled from the capital city in [[Trowulan]] to their ancestral home, in order to honor and appease ancestral spirits. In [[Bali]]nese tradition, [[Balinese Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Balinese people]] came home to their hometowns or their home villages during [[Galungan]] and Kuningan sacred days, as they believed it marks the time when the ancestral spirits visit their descendants in the mortal world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Warga Mudik Galungan, Denpasar Sepi |date = 31 January 2012 | author = Muhammad Hasanudin | newspaper = Kompas |url = http://regional.kompas.com/read/2012/01/31/15165221/Warga.Mudik.Galungan.Denpasar.Sepi |language =Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most parts of Indonesia where [[Islam in Indonesia|Islam]] is the majority, the homecoming or ''mudik'' tradition is most often conducted in the month of [[Ramadhan]], between a week to several days prior to [[Lebaran]] ([[Eid al-Fitr]]). Nevertheless, other ethnicities such as the [[Madurese people|Madurese]] are known to conduct their ''mudik'' tradition prior to [[Eid al-Adha]] instead. [[Christianity in Indonesia|Indonesian Christians]], on the other hand, might travel to their hometown prior to [[Christmas]].

The term ''mudik'' to coin the specific homecoming activity, started to enter common Indonesians' vocabulary since the 1970s. It is suggested that in 1970s, during the start of [[Suharto]]'s centralized [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order regime]], the prominence of [[Jakarta]] as the center of the nation's politics, administrative and economic activities prompted massive urbanization, where the population of rural Javanese villages flocked and migrated to Jakarta and surrounding areas ([[Greater Jakarta]]) seeking jobs and economic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work =Intisari | title =Asal Mula Mudik | author = Yoyok Prima Maulana | date = 28 July 2014 |url =http://intisari-online.com/read/asal-mula-mudik |language =Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the migrants came from rural Javanese areas; nevertheless, Jakarta also attracted migrants from all over Indonesia. These newcomer migrants, that still nurture their links to their hometowns in rural Java or other corners in Indonesia, were actively involved in the annual mudik travel.

Outside of Java, Mudik homecoming is also significantly observable in [[Sumatra]], especially in [[West Sumatra]], [[Riau]], [[Jambi]], [[South Sumatra]] corridors, where numbers of migrant workers, especially [[Minangkabau people|Minang]] ''perantauan'' (migrant) return to their hometown to celebrate Idul Fitri.

== Scale ==
The government of Indonesia provides additional transportation to handle the massive surge of travellers in several days prior to and after the Lebaran. In 2013 there were around 30 million people travelling to their hometowns during Lebaran. They spent a total sum of around 90 trillion [[rupiah]] (around US$9 billion)&lt;ref name="Kompas"&gt;{{id}} {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in rural areas. The numbers of Indonesians that take ''mudik'' or ''pulang kampung'' travel is quite tremendous. In 2017 it was estimated that the people that took annual ''mudik'' travel reached 33 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bisnis.liputan6.com/read/2998922/jumlah-pemudik-2017-diprediksi-mencapai-33-juta-orang|title=Jumlah Pemudik 2017 Diprediksi Mencapai 33 Juta Orang|author=Septian Deny|work=liputan6.com|language=id|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers is approximately equal to the whole population of [[Malaysia]] (31 million, 2017 est.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/my.html|title=Malaysia, The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This causes massive traffic jams and a sudden rise of demand and volume of intercity transportation.

== Impacts ==

=== Transportation ===
[[File:Pemudik Stasiun Jatinegara.jpg|thumb|right|Train passenger waiting for their train in [[Jatinegara Station]] during Mudik travel.]]
The demand for [[Rail transport in Indonesia|train]] and [[Transport in Indonesia#Air transport|airplane]] tickets usually spikes a month or two prior to Lebaran, prompting an unusually higher cost for tickets for highly sought days of departure. Some airlines might add extra flights or operate larger airplanes to deal with the surge in demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Airlines Ajukan 90 Extra Flight untuk Lebaran |url=https://www.cnbcindonesia.com/news/20180425191505-4-12506/airlines-ajukan-90-extra-flight-untuk-lebaran |accessdate=9 June 2018 |work=CNBC Indonesia |date=25 April 2018 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian train operator [[Kereta Api Indonesia]] usually offers additional train trips or introduces longer trains with more cars in order to meet the demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bempah |first1=Ramdhan Triyadi |title=PT KAI Siapkan 16 Kereta Tambahan untuk Antisipasi Lonjakan Pemudik |url=https://regional.kompas.com/read/2018/05/04/10122711/pt-kai-siapkan-16-kereta-tambahan-untuk-antisipasi-lonjakan-pemudik. |accessdate=9 June 2018 |work=Kompas |date=4 May 2018 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private operators of intercity and interprovince buses usually charge higher ticket costs during this period.

The heaviest burdens faced during mudik are [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] and travel delays on [[public transport]] or the existing [[road network]].

The impact is indeed tremendous as millions of buses, cars and motorcycles jam the roads and highways, causing kilometres of traffic jams each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/09/01/govt-says-roads-ready-lebaran-exodus.html | title =Govt says roads ready for Lebaran exodus |newspaper = [[The Jakarta Post]] |date = 1 September 2010 | accessdate = 2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The massive congestion usually occurs along [[Trans-Java toll road]] and Java's [[North Coast Road (Java)|Northern Coast Road]]. 
[[File:Java Transportation Network.svg|thumb|right|340px|The Java's [[North Coast Road (Java)|Northern Coast Road]] is usually heavily clogged during the annual Mudik travel.]]

The mudik travellers take various modes of transportation to reach their hometowns. Some of them might even ride a [[motorcycle]]. Although it might be done for short range of travel, the police and authority have discouraged this practice, citing the motorcycle's potential danger and unsuitablity for mid- to long-range mudik travel. Large numbers of mudik accidents involve motorcyclists. To reduce mudik travellers using motorcycles, the government tried to lure motorcyclists away from mudik travel by offering ''mudik gratis'', or free mudik program. The program offers motorcyclists a free service to send their motorcycles via railways, trucks or ships to their towns separately, while they travel with another mode of transportation instead. Despite initial success in reducing mudik motorcyclists in 2014 and 2015, the number of mudik motorcyclists spiked in 2016 to 5.6 million motorcycles.&lt;ref name="BBC-1"/&gt;

=== Business ===
The sudden exodus of large numbers of migrant workers — most of them are low-skilled labourers, domestic helpers, and those who work in service sectors — has created a void in Jakarta and other major cities' daily activities, as numbers of business, services, establishments, ''[[warung]]'' and restaurants are closed for Lebaran. The sudden loss of occupants after Mudik is also observable on relatively empty Jakarta streets during Lebaran, which normally suffers from clogged traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Mudik: a blessing for some Jakarta residents | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | location = Jakarta | date = 5 July 2016| url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/07/05/mudik-a-blessingfor-some-jakarta-residents.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the wealthier classes — who do not participate in mudik travel —  often go to local hotels or overseas to accommodate the absence of their domestic servants, drivers, and even security guards.

'''Māori culture''' is the [[culture]] of the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]] (an Eastern [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] people) and forms a distinctive part of [[Culture of New Zealand|New Zealand culture]].

Within the Māori community, and to a lesser extent throughout New Zealand as a whole, the word '''''Māoritanga''''' is often used as an approximate synonym for Māori culture, the [[Māori language|Māori]] suffix ''-tanga'' being roughly equivalent to the qualitative noun ending "-ness" in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|title=Glossary|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/glossary|website=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|accessdate=19 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahu|first1=Paenga, Maria Dawn Te|title=Te Māoritanga: wellbeing and identity. Kapa haka as a vehicle for Māori health promotion|url=http://aut.researchgateway.ac.nz/handle/10292/530|publisher=Auckland University of Technology|accessdate=19 November 2016|language=en|date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been three distinct but overlapping cultural eras—before widespread European contact, the 1800s in which Māori began interacting with European visitors and settlers, and the modern era since the beginning of the 20th century. Culture in the modern era has been shaped by increasing [[urbanisation]], closer contact with New Zealanders of European descent (or ''[[Pākehā]]'') and revival of traditional practices.

Traditional arts make up a large section of [[New Zealand art]] and include [[whakairo]] (carving), [[Māori traditional textiles|raranga]] (weaving), [[kapa haka]] (group performance), [[Whakapapa|whaikorero]] (oratory), and [[tā moko]] (tattoo). Practitioners often follow the techniques of their ancestors, but today Māoritanga also includes contemporary arts such as film, television, [[Māori poetry|poetry]] and theatre.

Pre-European [[Māori mythology|Māori stories and legends]] were handed down orally and through weavings and carvings. Some surviving ''Te Toi Whakairo'', or carving, is over 500-years-old. ''Tohunga Whakairo'' are the great carvers—the master craftsmen. The Māori believed that the gods created and communicated through the master craftsmen. Carving has been a ''[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]'' art, subject to the rules and laws of ''tapu''. Pieces of wood that fell aside as the carver worked were never thrown away, neither were they used for the cooking of food. Women were not permitted near ''Te Toi Whakairo''.

The [[Māori language]] is known natively as ''te reo Māori'', or shortened to ''te reo'' (literally, the language). At the beginning of the twentieth century, it looked like ''te reo'' as well as other aspects of Māori life would disappear. In the 1980s however, government-sponsored schools taught ''te reo'', educating those of European descent as well as Māori.

==Polynesian settlement of New Zealand==
Māori cultural history is inextricably tied into the culture of [[Polynesia]] as a whole. [[Aotearoa]] (New Zealand) is the southwestern corner of the [[Polynesian Triangle]], a region of the Pacific Ocean with three island groups at its corners: [[Hawaiian Islands|the Hawai{{okina}}i islands]], Rapa Nui ([[Easter Island]]), and New Zealand ([[Aotearoa]] in Māori).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.maori.com/aotearoa|title=Aotearoa - The Maori Name for New Zealand|last=Limited|first=Maori Tourism|website=www.maori.com|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The many island cultures within the Polynesian Triangle share similar languages derived from a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|proto-Malayo-Polynesian language]] used in southeastern Asia 5,000 years ago. Polynesians also share cultural traditions such as religion, social organisation, myths, and material culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Polynesia|title=Polynesian culture {{!}} cultural region, Pacific Ocean|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists believe that all Polynesians have descended from a south Pacific proto-culture created by an [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] (Malayo-Polynesian) people that had migrated from southeastern Asia.

The other main Polynesian cultures are [[Easter Island|Rapa Nui]] (now known as Easter Island), [[Hawaii|Hawaiʻi]], [[Marquesas]], [[Samoa|Sāmoa]], [[Tahiti]], [[Tonga]], and [[Cook Islands]].

Over the last five millennia, a sequence of complicated and remarkable transoceanic treks were performed in an unprecedented accomplishment of navigation and curiosity. The final segments of these feats were across extreme and unmatched distances: to Hawaii, Rapanui, and Aotearoa.  &lt;ref&gt; Alice Te Punga Somerville , ''Once Were Pacific: Maori Connections to Oceania'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2009), 17. 
 &lt;/ref&gt;  

===Voyage to Aotearoa===
{{main|Polynesian navigation}}Polynesian seafarers were ocean navigators and [[astronomy|astronomers]]. Polynesians would travel long distances by sea. The strong female presence among early settlers in New Zealand suggests Polynesian migration voyages were not accidental but deliberate. The most current reliable evidence strongly indicates that initial settlement of New Zealand occurred around 1280 CE from the [[Society Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;The Search of Ancient New Zealand. p223. H Campbell and G  Hutchings. GNS. Penguin. Auckland 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lowe |first=David J. |title=Polynesian settlement of New Zealand and the impacts of volcanism on early Maori society: an update |url=http://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/10289/2690/1/Lowe%202008%20Polynesian%20settlement%20guidebook.pdf |accessdate=2010-01-18 |isbn=978-0-473-14476-0 |journal=Guidebook for Pre-conference North Island Field Trip A1 'Ashes and Issues' |date=November 2008 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1769 the experienced Society Island navigator [[Tupaia (navigator)|Tupaia]] joined [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] in the [[HMS Endeavour|Endeavour]] on his voyage south.  Despite a gap of many hundreds of years Tupaia was able to understand the Maori language which was very similar to the language he spoke. His presence and ability to translate avoided much of the friction between other European explorers and Maori in New Zealand.

European sailors, including Cook, found Polynesian sailors lost at sea, suggesting that by mid 18th century Polynesians had lost the art of very long distance navigation.&lt;ref&gt;Aphrodite's Island. Ch 10 Tupaia's ship. Anne Salmond. Penguin. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moa-hunter period===
Researchers often label the time from about 1280 to about 1450 the "Moa-hunter period" - after the [[moa]], the large flightless bird that formed a large part of the diet of the early settlers. Nine different moa species occurred commonly in the south-east and east of the South Island. In the far South it was too cold to grow the [[Sweet potato|kūmara sweet potato]] . Large quantities of [[Cordyline australis|tī]] tubers were eaten that were slow-cooked in large ''umu'' or ''[[hāngi]]'' (earth ovens) to get rid of poison and to produce a slightly sweet pulp. Shellfish, fish, sharks and seals were also common foods. Native dogs (kurī) and rats were brought from the Pacific Islands. The introduction of rats undoubtedly had more impact on New Zealand wildlife than any other organism apart from humans.&lt;ref&gt;In Search Of Ancient NZ.p 223&lt;/ref&gt; The dogs were used for hunting but also as food.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p 10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
The  Society Island colonists explored New Zealand to find suitable stone for tool-making. The main stone source areas included [[Mayor Island]], Taupo and Kerikeri for obsidian (volcanic glass); prospectors soon found ''pounamu'' (greenstone or jade) and argillite (''pakohe'') resources in the South Island in the Reefton and Nelson areas. Stone served in all aspects of Polynesian life: from chopping wood to cutting and slicing food, as anchors for ''waka'' and fishing nets, as hangi stones for retaining the heat in a slow-cooking earth oven, as drills using chert, and for stone clubs.

Archaeological evidence in early proto-Māori settlements, especially at the [[Wairau Bar]] that was intensively studied by [[Roger Duff]],&lt;ref name="DNZB Duff"&gt;{{DNZB|last=Davidson|first=Janet|id=5d27|title=Roger Shepherd Duff|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows some typical East Polynesian cultural practices, including burial methods and the use of hangi (earth ovens).

Two Polynesian artifacts link early settlers to Polynesia. One, a turret shell only found in the South Pacific islands, most notably in the Society Islands, has been reworked into a small chisel found at Wairau Bar and dated to about 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Pacific Archaeology Vol 2. No 2 2011. J. Davidson et al.&lt;/ref&gt; The other is a 6&amp;nbsp;cm long Polynesian pearl fishing lure found at Tairua in 1962. This lure has been reliably dated to the early- to mid-14th century. It was found at a typical small coastal moa-hunters' site which has been interpreted as an itinerant hunting camp (whakaruruhau).&lt;ref&gt;CFG Heritage Ltd. Louise Furey. 2009. Report to Historical Places Trust.2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of Mayor Island [[obsidian]] on the [[Kermadec Islands]], halfway between New Zealand and Polynesia, strongly suggests return journeys were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Michael|title=The Penguin History of New Zealand|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New Zealand|isbn=0 14 301867 1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new environment offered challenges to the settlers.  Its cold climate meant that tropical staple crops needed careful cultivation to survive, and some failed to grow locally.  [[Sweet potato|Kūmara]] was an important crop that arrived with the Polynesian settlers.  Much of the activity to produce kūmara became ritualised – it was even associated with Rongomātāne (Rongo), a high-ranking atua (god).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Adds|first=Peter|title= Kūmara - Religious aspects|url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/kumara/page-4|work= Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate= 1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kūmara featured in some whakataukī (proverbs): "Kaore te kūmara e kōrero mo tōna māngaro" (the kūmara does not speak of its own sweetness) encouraged people to be modest.

However, there were also new opportunities.  Māori learned to use local resources like [[pounamu]], native timber, [[Phormium|''harakeke'']] and the abundant birdlife, producing practical tools or food, as well as beautiful ornaments and items of clothing.

Seasonal activities included gardening, fishing and the hunting of birds. Main tasks were segregated for men and women, but there were also a lot of group activities involving food gathering and food cultivation.

== Culture in the Classic period==
Māori artifacts began to change around the 15th century from East Polynesian style to one more recognisably "classical" Māori,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Michael|title=The Penguin History of New Zealand|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New Zealand|isbn=0 14 301867 1|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; a style which persisted well into the contact period in the 18th and 19th centuries.  At the same time, Māori groups became less nomadic, more settled in defined territories, and more dependent on gardening as a food source.  Reliance on stored food such as kūmara tubers meant that stores needed to be protected from marauding neighbours.  The widespread construction of large fortifications called [[pā]] on prominent hills and spurs dates from this time, as evidence of the development of a more martial, tribal culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Michael|title=The Penguin History of New Zealand|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New Zealand|isbn=0 14 301867 1|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key concept regulating social and economic exchange was utu, which is sometimes translated as revenge but better translated as "reciprocity" or "balanced exchange".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Michael|title=The Penguin History of New Zealand|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New Zealand|isbn=0 14 301867 1|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economically, this took the form of gift exchange. This was governed by three basic principles. Firstly giving had to have the appearance of being free and spontaneous, without stipulation of a return present. Secondly a strict system of obligation was in force whereby the receiver was bound to not only reciprocate but to increase the value of the reciprocated gift. Thirdly the system demanded that further social obligation had now been established to continue the exchanges. Failure to respond meant loss of mana or influence. Where parties had traveled a long way to give a present it was expected that the return gift be immediate but often due to seasonal food supplies it was accepted that a return gift would be given at some later date when supplies allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Primitive Economics of the New Zealand Maori. R Firth. 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

While a gift conveyed an obligation to return the favour, so did an insult.  The response might be a martial one.  Historian Angela Ballara describes warfare as a "learned, culturally determined [response] to offences against the rules of Māori society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ballara|first=Angela|title=Taua  "Musket Wars", "Land Wars", or Tikanga? Warfare in Maori Society in Early Nineteenth Century|year=2003|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0143018892|page=cited in King, p82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Judith Binney says that maintaining and increasing the mana of whanau and hapu and loyalty within the group are unquestionably at the heart of Māori cultural concepts. She says that Māori cultural history is confusing to the uninformed as it consists of narrative-myths that stretch far back in time. Also confusing is that chronological time is irrelevant or distorted&lt;ref&gt;Stores Without End. J. Binney, p 182&lt;/ref&gt; to the  Māori cultural story, so a person living in the present may narrate a story about their family or hapu that happened centuries ago; nonetheless, the narrator appears as a contemporary figure in the myth. A key element of cultural leadership is to link the narrator to a well known historical figure with mana (prestige/authority power).&lt;ref&gt;Stories Without End, J Binney, pp. 78-85&lt;/ref&gt; This is why being able to recite the family history is so important. In Māori culture names of people and places are fluid. Individuals may change their name several times or have several different names that they use depending on the cultural situation. In the past, hapu changed names if they moved to another area where an alternative name was more positive. One of the main reasons for name fluidity was access to resources. As a hapu moved seasonally to utilise different resources its name changed to reflect an ancestor who had historical cultural rights to that resource. Binney says that being connected to a powerful hapu with many well known ancestors was important for protection and survival.
As Māori communication was almost totally oral until well into the contact period, oral myth-narratives became more varied to match the needs of each hapu or whanau.

Tapu is a key concept within Maori culture, that sustains structure and social order. It can be seen as a legal or religious concept, that is centered on the idea of being "forbidden" and "sacred." When a person, place, or thing is considered to be "tapu," it is often distinguished as something in high value and importance, being set aside by the gods. &lt;ref&gt; Hans Mol, ''Fixed and the Fickle : Religion and Identity in New Zealand'' (Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1981), 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mana is a cultural concept of the Māori, meaning a sacred power or authority. Tapu is similar to mana. Together, they keep the harmony of things. Mana is sacred power bestowed by the gods on the ancestral lineage of chiefs, or tohunga. While the mana itself is a supernatural gift, the chief is free to waste or magnify it.  &lt;ref&gt; Hans Mol, ''Fixed and the Fickle: Religion and Identity in New Zealand'' (Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Press,1981), 15. &lt;/ref&gt;

The word "utu" is often associated with the word 'revenge'. However, in a broader sense, "utu" is meant as the preservation of balance and harmony within a civilization. In the concept of "utu", a fault must always be corrected. However, the means by which this is accomplished may vary greatly by case. In the context of a gift exchange, "utu" creates and preserves social connections and commitments. "Utu" recovers balance in the event that social relations are interrupted. A version of "utu", "muru", is defined as the confiscation of a person's possessions as reparation for a misdeed against an individual, community, or society. &lt;ref&gt; "The Boyd Incident,"  Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 20 December 2012, retrieved on 10 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;


===Disease===
Classic Māori viewed disease as a punishment for breaking tribal tapu but [[tohunga]] recognised that some families were prone to certain disease. The standard practice of tohunga was to isolate the victim in a small shelter. The most common serious disease was tuberculosis (''kohi''), which was present in the colonizing Polynesians. Classic Māori did not recognise the symptoms as being from one disease. Kohi was considered the work of demons and caused by [[Makutu]] (witchcraft).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hiroa|first1=Te Rangi|title=Medicine Amongst the Maoris, in Ancient and Modern Times|date=1910|location=tuberculosis|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-BucMedi-t1-body-d1-d13-d4.html|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toke toke was the name of the devil that caused tubercular bone disease. Tuberculosis of the neck glands was called hura or hone. This was very common. Tubercular ulcers were called poka poka. The early European explorer and painter, Earle, noted in 1827 that these diseases were common even in isolated inland districts such as Taupo. His Māori advisers said the diseases were very old. Leprosy was another common disease. Māori legends had the disease arriving with the canoe that bought the Ngati Whatua to New Zealand. The Māori name was Ngerengare or Tuwhenua or Tukawaiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hiroa|first1=Te Rangi|title=Medicine Amongst the Maoris, in Ancient and Modern Times|date=1910|page=74|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz//tm/scholarly/tei-BucMedi-t1-body-d1-d13-d5.html|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lepers were carefully isolated and avoided as it was recognised the disease was contagious. Two places-a location on  Maungatautari mountain, near Cambridge and a cave at Oremu in Taupo have been recognised as  places where lepers were isolated. Treatment of leprosy was by mixing two plants -Kawakawa and Ngaio with either dog or human excreta. The treatment did not work if a dog was touched according to Māori lore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medicine Amongst the Maoris, in Ancient and Modern Times|author=Te Rangi Hiroa|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-BucMedi.html|year=1910|pages=70–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earle recognised that tohunga used a range of plants to treat minor skin ailments. Much later European doctors advocated investigation of the medicinal properties of  plants commonly used in Māori medicine.

===Food===
Eating shellfish such as mussels and oysters was very common. During summer sea fish such as kahawai were caught using bone or [[Lygodium articulatum|mangemange]] hooks, 2 piece lures or large flax nets. In creeks and lakes, eels were caught in large numbers when migrating along known waterways using hinaki,  a long cone shaped net. Birds such as ducks were targeted during the moulting season and young birds such as Petrels and Gannets were taken from nests and cooked in their own fat to preserve them. Such preserved birds were favourite gifts to fulfill social gift obligations.  Māori closely observed the natural world to take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Native  pigeons ate Miro berries which made them thirsty. Māori carved wooden bowls equipped with multiple neck snares and placed these in  Miro trees to catch these large birds.

Evidence from many recent Eastern Golden Bay excavations, especially at Tata Beach, shows that in middens local shellfish and fish bones were most prominent, followed by dog (kuri) bones and rat bones. Less common were bones from small birds and sea mammals. The Tata beach site and other nearby sites such as Takapou were in use during the late "Moa hunter" period-1450 up to 1660, well into the "Classic Māori" period. The coastal sites showed that Māori had created man made soils in the sand dunes ranging from small to very large(over 100M2). The natural soil A horizons had been modified by placing dark, humus rich soil near the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Current Anthropology. Vol. 53, No 6. Dec 2012. Gardens of Rongo. I. Barber University of Otago.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was widespread in Māori communities where kūmara was grown, although in many cases free-draining sand, gravels and pumice were mixed with humus rich loam. Kūmara are slow growing in the temperate NZ climate and need free-draining sub soils. In the Eastern Golden Bay north facing slopes were favoured.&lt;ref&gt;Gardens of Rongo. I. Barber.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buildings===
[[File:Pataka.jpg|thumb|Pataka with [[tekoteko]]]]
The standard building in a classic Māori settlement was a simple sleeping ''whare puni'' (house/hut) about 2 metres x 3 metres with a low roof, an earth floor, no window and a single low doorway. Heating was provided by a small open fire in winter. There was no chimney.

Material used in construction varied between areas, but raupo reeds, flax and totara bark shingles for the roof were common.&lt;ref&gt;Te Papa Museum of NZ. Wharepuni.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar small ''whare'', but with interior drains, were used to store kūmara on sloping racks.

In the classic period a higher proportion of ''whare'' were located inside ''pa'' than was the case after contact with Europeans. A chief's ''whare'' was similar but larger—often with full headroom in the centre, a small window and  a partly enclosed front porch. In times of conflict the chief lived in a ''whare'' on the ''tihi'' or summit of a hill pa. In colder areas, such as in the North Island central plateau, it was common for ''whare'' to be partly sunk into the ground for better insulation.

Food was not cooked in the sleeping ''whare'' but in the open or under a ''kauta'' (lean-to). Saplings with branches and foliage removed were used to store and dry items such as fishing nets or cloaks. Valuable items were stored in pole-mounted storage shelters called ''pataka''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John White (ethnographer)|John White]] ''The Ancient History of the Maori, His Mythology and Traditions''. Volume V1 (1888). Pataka. Online at [[NZETC]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other constructions were large racks for drying split fish.

During the construction of important buildings, slaves were sometimes used as a sacrifice. This practice was done in order to express the buildings' significance and to secure the gods' protection. For smaller buildings, small animals were sacrificed to distinguish it from other buildings and to exhibit its uniqueness. &lt;ref&gt;Hans Mol, ''Fixed and the Fickle : Religion and Identity in New Zealand'' (Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1981), 13. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture change by contact with Europeans in the 1800s==
Because of the very small number of Europeans who visited New Zealand in the 18th and early 19th century, the core values of Māori culture were little altered. [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] estimated there were only 1100 Europeans in the North Island in 1839, with 200 being missionaries, and a total of about 500–600 Europeans in the Bay of Islands.&lt;ref&gt;The Meeting Place. O'Malley, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The northern Māori population at the time has been estimated by Ian Poole at about 30,000 to 40,000.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

For decades, missionaries had very little influence over Māori in the north. Missionaries were appalled at the violent, seemingly arbitrary nature of Māori behaviour. They had no influence on warfare, slavery, sexual abuse of women, killing of female children or revenge killings. Cannibalism continued as before, except that increasingly Māori learnt to be less boastful about this act. However, by 1840, the custom was all but abolished.&lt;ref&gt;The Meeting Place. V. O'Malley. p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

In the coastal South Island the Māori population was very small. Whalers set up shore stations along the southern and eastern coasts and formed Māori–European working communities. In the early 1800s it was common for chiefs to provide whalers with Māori wives, often their daughters. By the 1820s, European men had married about 200 Māori women in the coastal area between modern Christchurch and Invercargill, about half of all the marriageable aged women in the South Island - in fact Māori men were finding it hard to compete for wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Ḿalley|first=Vincent|title=The Meeting Place: Māori and Pākehā Encounters: 1642–1840|publisher= Auckland University Press|location=Auckland, New Zealand |year=2012 |page=320 |isbn=9781869405946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact with Europeans enabled Māori to access the material culture of England, then the most advanced industrial nation in the world. By 1800, the desire for iron objects such as large ships' nails overcame apprehension about boarding an anchored ship and this drove Māori trading behaviour, lasting until 1840.&lt;ref&gt;The Meeting Place. V O'Malley.P32&lt;/ref&gt; Desirable steel objects and blankets were at first traded for fish. Māori were generally very curious about European culture after initial misunderstandings and apprehension, with Māori showing great ability to accept changes and integrating these into their normal way of life&lt;ref&gt;The Meeting Place. V O'Malley. Auckland University Press. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Climates of War''. E. Bohan. p 29&lt;/ref&gt; Marion Du Fresne gave northern Māori potatoes, wheat, onions, goats, pigs, chickens and other food to raise. Potatoes and pigs rapidly became a key part of Māori agriculture in the north, but the new food was almost exclusively reserved for trading purposes, with Māori still eating fish and fern roots, supplemented by [[kūmara]]. Later, as Māori grew large areas of potatoes (Hongi Hika had a 40-acre potato field), whalers would call into the Bay of Islands in particular to trade for fresh supplies.

One significant change was the immediacy of reciprocation in trade. In tradition Māori tikanga, when an item was given there was no expectation of immediate response as gifted items were mainly food, which was governed by seasonal supply. When dealing with Europeans, Māori learnt that immediate payment was expected. Gift giving was a different matter in Māori culture. Gifts were given to recognise mana (power or authority).&lt;ref&gt;The Meeting Place. O'Malley. p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Burial practices also changed to incorporate aspects of Christianity. Bodies were usually buried in the ground by the mid 1840s although sometimes coffins, decorated with Maori motifs were used, suspended in trees or on poles as drawn by J. Polack. These were highly tapu.&lt;ref&gt;Voyages. p 147. P Moon. Penguin 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Moon. p 195. Quoting artist George Angas.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular influences===
Gradually, the Māori learned to trade for money instead of goods. This was rare before 1834 but became increasingly common as more Māori worked as sailors on European ships, where they gained a good reputation as being strong capable workers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

By 1839 a large proportion of the Māori trade in goods was paid for in cash, with Māori showing a strong preference for coins rather than paper banknotes. Northern Māori learnt that they could more easily hide cash from their relatives avoiding the traditional obligatory sharing of goods with their ''hapu''. The period 1835 to 1840 completed the revolution in the north Māori economy with Māori abandoning many of their former trading habits and adopting those of the Europeans to the point where Māori became dependent on the flow of European goods to maintain their new way of life.&lt;ref&gt;The Meeting Place. V. O'Malley.P130-135.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The effect of trading increased the influence of chiefs over their ''hapu''. Northern traders assumed that the chief was the organizational head of the ''hapu'' and all trade went through him including payments for goods purchased. O'Malley says this gave chiefs much more influence, especially after 1835, because trade was so regular. He says that in pre-contact times the power of chiefs was never very great, largely being restricted to directing warfare.&lt;ref&gt;The Meeting Place.V. O'Malley. p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Early European observers noted that at ''hapu'' and ''whanuau hui''(meetings) every person, including women, had their say and the chief had no more influence than any other person on the final decision. Where a chief had great mana, especially powers of persuasion, chiefs had more influence because of their personality rather than any recognised authority.
 
Not all iwi had regular contact with Europeans. The French explorer D'Urville visited Tasman Bay in 1827 and using knowledge he had picked up at the Bay of Islands was able to communicate with local Māori. He found that although they had some passing awareness of Europeans—they seemed to know about firearms—the extent of their understanding was far less than that of the Northern Māori.&lt;ref&gt;A Savage Country, Moon. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Waikato regular contact did not start until five decades after contact in the north of New Zealand. It was not until Ngāti Toa was forced out of Kawhia in 1821 that the bulk of the Tainui people had contact with Europeans. In 1823 a man called Te Puaha visited the Bay of Islands bringing back with him a Captain Kent who arrived by ship at Kawhia.

By 1859 trade was the main area in which Māori interacted with Europeans. Trade was an area that Māori expected to control. From first contact they had sold or exchanged fresh foodstuffs initially for high value goods such as axes and later for money. Grey was keen to encourage Māori trade and commerce and established new laws to empower them in 1846. Māori brought numerous cases under this legislation and won. This was their first and most successful legal experience.&lt;ref&gt;Climates of War.p36. E Burke. Hazard Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Māori had begun to include European concepts into their own cultural behaviour.

===Agriculture===
The introduction of European foods changed many aspects of Māori agriculture. Under tradition, Māori agriculture land was abandoned after a few crops because of reduced production. This was the common pattern apart from a few very fertile alluvial river valleys. Fertiliser was not used&lt;ref&gt;Historical Frictions. M. Belgrave. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; although Māori had devised various techniques to enhance production such as the addition of pumice or similar materials to improve drainage on heavy soils. Māori allowed gardens to revert to shrubs and plantations were shifted to another area.

The warmer climate of the north and northern and central coastal regions allowed better growth of subtropical plants such as kūmara, yam and gourds. In Auckland, and on Mayor Island, volcanic land was cleared of rocks which were used for low shelter walls. In some areas piles of volcanic rock which kept warm at night, were used to train the vines of gourds.

Many special techniques had been devised to grow and especially to store kūmara so it did not rot. Careful storage and use of tapu was essential to prevent unauthorised use. Seed kūmara in particular were highly tapu. The main problem for kūmara growers were native caterpillars. Early European explorers reported that Māori often ringed a garden with burning vegetation in an attempt to control caterpillars. The introduction of foreign weeds which thrived was a significant issue from the 1820s but offset by the widespread growth of the introduced potato.

European farms and the methods they used became a cultural and economic magnet for Māori&lt;ref&gt;Historical Frictions.M. Belgrave. P110.&lt;/ref&gt; in the North, in Auckland and later in the Te Awamutu area of the Waikato. Under the tuition of missionaries, Māori learnt to mass-produce food, especially potatoes, far in excess of their own needs for trading into the late 1850s. In 1858 European numbers equalled Māori numbers and increasingly European farmers were able to supply towns such as Auckland. At the same time the strong market demand for supplying food to the gold rush markets in Australia and California ended.

Māori continued to use traditional fern roots—aruhe—as a normal part of their diet into the mid-19th century.

=== Land dealings===
{{POV section|date=April 2015}}
Many Europeans entered into dealings with Māori to obtain land for their use. In some cases settlers thought they were buying land to obtain equivalent to freehold title under British law; Māori now claim that the various deeds signed by Māori were more limited and conditional, stopping short of outright alienation. They claim that the use of the word "tuku" in deeds, meaning to let or allow or give freely, was not the same as selling. In 1997 the Waitangi Tribunal found that before the Treaty, Māori customs with respect to the land applied, and no valid sales could have been concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Waitangi Tribunal,"[https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_68635760/Muriwhenua%20Land.pdf Muriwhenua Land Report]", p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, such as Dr Vincent O'Malley and history professor Michael Ballard, argue that the Tribunal ignored a large volume of documentary evidence that ran counter to its findings while upholding oral traditions that were incapable of being corroborated.&lt;ref&gt;The Meeting Place.V.O'Malley. Auckland University Press 2012.P147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Māori, especially after 1830, were eager to have Europeans living on their land under their protection so they could benefit from European knowledge. Missionaries on the other hand were keen to buy land so they could grow their own food to make them less dependent on tribal "protectors", who sometimes used food supplies to coerce them. Missionaries sought the ownership of land to enjoy financial security. Settlers allowed Maori to stay on the land they had "bought" and often continued to give presents to tribal chiefs, often prompted by the chiefs themselves, in order to maintain friendly relationships. These compromises stopped with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.&lt;ref&gt;The Meeting Place. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason for Māori to "sell" land to missionaries was to protect the title of the land from other tribal competitors. Māori who had converted to Christianity wanted to protect their land without resorting to warfare. Some degree of control passed to the missionaries who Māori trusted to allow them continued access and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz/WhyaTreaty.html|title=The Treaty of Waitangi|website=www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1840 generally older chiefs were reluctant to sell while younger chiefs were in favour. The situation was complicated as Māori often had overlapping rights on poorly defined land. The settlers and the government also had very limited access to trained surveyors and even freehold land boundaries were ill-defined. Surveying was a relatively new skill, invented in USA in the late 18th century, and involved much hard physical work especially in hill country. New farmers were able to purchase a small freehold farm from Māori on which they established their homestead and farm buildings. They then entered into leases with Māori owners for much larger areas of land. Short term leases gave Māori a powerful position as there was a large demand for grazing land.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The Native Lands Act was a policy enforced by the government in 1865, which allowed the Māori people to obtain individual titles for their land to sell. This act abolished the traditional shared landholdings and made it easier for European settlers to directly purchase land for themselves. &lt;ref&gt;M. P. K. Sorrenson, ''Ko te Whenua te Utu / Land Is the Price : Essays on Maori History, Land and Politics'' (Auckland: Auckland University Press, 2014), 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slaves===
There is little direct information on Māori slaves before the Musket Wars but it seems as though slavery was most likely present as the use of the term mokai indicates. Also Ngati Mutanga argued before the Native Land Court in 1870 that their enslavement of [[Moriori people|Morori]] was traditional Māori tikanga.

The British had outlawed slavery by 1807 but missionaries in New Zealand were in no position to force Māori to follow suit. Missionaries such as Henry Williams wrote of the fate of slaves being brought to the Bay of Islands by returning war canoes. Whanau who had lost a close relative in battle were seen to carry out immediate and bloody ''utu.'' Generally only female slaves were kept as they were less threat and more useful as potato farmers and partners. Potatoes could be grown by slaves, as they were not subject to the [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] restrictions around [[kūmara]] growing.&lt;ref&gt;''"The Meeting Place"'', p127&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834 Ngapuhi, partly due to the influence of  missionaries such as Henry Williams, freed slaves they had captured in earlier wars,&lt;ref&gt;Outcasts of the Gods. The struggle over slavery in Maori Society NZ . Ch 9. H. Petrie. Auckland University Press.

The only place in New Zealand where slavery was common after 1835 was in the Chatham Islands where North Taranaki tribes Ngati Tama and Ngati Mutanga invaded and launched a massacre of about 10% of the local Moriori, and enslaved the remainder who were forbidden to marry or continue any aspects of their own unique culture. Slavery continued on the island until about 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Moriori.M. King. Penguin 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missionaries===
CMS missionaries insisted Maori abandon cannibalism and child infanticide before they could be baptised. They tried to discourage polygamy. Some early missionaries had sympathy for abandoned wives but Henry Williams was adamant that polygamy disqualified Maori from baptism. CMS missionaries also outlawed the use of further ''moko,'' taking part in lewd dances and practising customary funeral rites.&lt;ref&gt;The Meeting Place, Vincent O'Malley.P175.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic missionaries who arrived 20 years after the Church of England CMS missionaries were less concerned with stopping these customary practices before Christian conversion. They reasoned that they could influence Maori more effectively after baptism and were subsequently successful in attracting many converts in the western Hokianga district, away from the dominant CMS influence.

Missionaries did not arrive in the Waikato until about 1834-5. CMS Mission Stations were established at Manakau, Maraetai, Waikato Heads, Kaitotehe opposite Tuapiri, Te Awamutu, Kopua and Kawhia. Missionaries helped explain the Treaty of Waitangi to Tainui in 1840.

===Education===
According to oral information Maori were familiar with the concept of schooling in tradition times as taught by tohunga (witch doctor/shaman). Bishop Selwyn took adult Maori to Sydney where they experienced limited schooling to learn English. When missionaries back in arrived in the Bay of Islands they realised that if they were going to introduce Christianity and change what they considered to be barbaric practices like cannibalism, slavery, lewd dancing and having multiple wives, they would need to establish schools. Both the missionaries and their wives constructed schools and provided slates and bibles as reading material. The first school was established by T. Kendal in 1816. Recently original slates and written material from that period in the Bay of Islands has been located, photographed and published. Some adults attended school but most pupils were the sons or daughter of chiefs or other persons of status.
By 1853 Mr and Mrs Ashwell had been running a mission school at Taupiri in the Waikato for 50 Maori girls for 3 years. The girls learnt arithmetic and reading.&lt;ref&gt;Voyagers.p63. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1860s Governor Grey had provided money to support a trade school near Te Awamutu in the Waikato. The aim was to produce Maori workers who were literate but could also work with, and repair, agricultural machinery as used on farms and in the new flour mills. In 1863 the renegade Rewi Maniapoto attacked and burnt down the school, stealing the printing press. He aimed to kill leading Europeans in the area but they had been warned by friendly Maori and left before the attack. Because of the negative influence of Maniapoto and other anti government factions, the school had previously had poor attendance, with as few as 10 boys attending regularly. All teaching by missionaries was in Maori and this continued in the native schools until  1900 when at the insistence of the Young Maori Party Maori MPs, schools started teaching in English. Influential Maori MPs [[Āpirana Ngata|Ngata]] and [[Māui Pōmare|Pōmare]] insisted that Maori be taught modern ways and sponsored the Suppression of Tohungaism Act in parliament. Pōmare in particular worked hard to banish ancient Maori concepts and practices that caused harm in the Maori community.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, Maui Pomare.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maori Newspapers (Niupepa)===
Maori were quick to learn the power of the printed word. The first Maori newspaper appeared in 1842. A number of different newspapers such as Te Pipiwharauroa and Te Korimako  were written in Maori by Maori to convey information to a widespread Maori audience, often of a political or ideological nature. Although print runs were often small it was common for a newspaper to be passed around a whole hapu. Although the government printed newspapers in Maori such as Te Karere Maori, the Kingitanga movement was anxious to convey their own message to Maori. Whereas the government and missionaries often used their newspapers as an educational tool -to inform Maori of British and later New Zealand laws and customs, the Kingitanga countered this with arguments for self-determination. Maori newspapers eagerly reported on events from overseas that showed groups such as the Irish challenging British sovereignty to obtain home rule.&lt;ref&gt;Far From Home. p 124-134 L. Fraser and A. McCarthy. Otago University Press. Dunedin 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First Māori interpretation of Christianity===
In the  1830s Te Atua Wera started the Papahurihia Faith in opposition to the missionaries. It mixed Christian, Judaic and Māori customary influences. They held services on Saturday and called themselves Hurai or Jews. Te Atua Wera reverted to the more customary role of a tohunga figure by the late 1830s. Te Atua Wera taught that heaven was a place where there was  happiness, no cold or hunger with an abundance of flour, sugar, muskets, ships, murder and voluptuousness.&lt;ref&gt;The Meeting Place.V.O'Malley p 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Māori kingship===
{{Main|Māori King Movement}}
From the time of their arrival in New Zealand, Māori lived in tribes that functioned independently under the leadership of their own chiefs. However, by the 1850s Māori were faced with increasing numbers of British settlers, political marginalisation and growing demand from the Crown to purchase their lands. From about 1853 Māori began reviving the ancient tribal ''runanga'' or chiefly war councils where land issues were raised and in May 1854 a large meeting—attracting as many as 2000 Māori leaders—was held at Manawapou in south Taranaki where speakers urged concerted opposition to selling land.&lt;ref name="dalton"&gt;{{cite book | last =Dalton | first = B.J.  | title = War and Politics in New Zealand 1855–1870| publisher =Sydney University Press |  year = 1967 | location =Sydney | pages =62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by a trip to England during which he had met [[Queen Victoria]], Te Rauparaha's son, [[Tamihana Te Rauparaha]], used the ''runanga'' to promote the idea of forming a Māori kingdom, with one king ruling over all tribes.&lt;ref name="sinclair"&gt;{{cite book | last =Sinclair | first =Keith| title = A History of New Zealand | publisher =Penguin | edition =2000 | year = 2000 | location =Auckland | pages =115–117  | isbn =0-14-029875-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kotahitanga'' or unity movement was aimed at bringing to Māori the unity that was an obvious strength among the Europeans.&lt;ref name="dalton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sinclair" /&gt; It was believed that by having a monarch who could claim status similar to that of Queen Victoria, Māori would be able to deal with [[Pākehā]] (Europeans) on equal footing.

Several North Island candidates who were asked to put themselves forward declined,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = In search of a king - Maori king movement | work = New Zealand History Online | publisher =History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage | date=20 December 2012 | url =http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/the-maori-king-movement/in-search-of-a-king | accessdate = 25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
but in February 1857 [[Wiremu Tamihana]], a chief of the [[Ngāti Hauā]] ''iwi'' in eastern Waikato, proposed the elderly and high-ranking Waikato chief [[Pōtatau Te Wherowhero|Te Wherowhero]] as an ideal monarch and despite his initial reluctance he was crowned at [[Ngaruawahia]] in June 1858, later adopting the name Pōtatau Te Wherowhero or simply Pōtatau.&lt;ref name="potatau"&gt;{{cite web | title = Potatau agrees to be king | work = New Zealand History Online | publisher =History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage | date=20 December 2012 | url =http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/the-maori-king-movement/potatau-te-wherowhero | accessdate = 25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daltonpot"&gt;{{cite book | last =Dalton | first = B.J.  | title = War and Politics in New Zealand 1855–1870| publisher =Sydney University Press |  year = 1967 | location =Sydney | pages =68–72, 83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was widespread respect for the movement's efforts in establishing a "land league" to slow land sales, Pōtatau's role was strongly embraced only by Waikato Māori, with ''iwi'' of North Auckland and south of Waikato showing him scant recognition. Over time the King Movement came to have a flag, a council of state, a code of laws, a "King's Resident Magistrate", police, a bank, a surveyor and a newspaper, ''Te Hokioi'', all of which gave the movement the appearance of an alternative government.&lt;ref name="stuart"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Park | first = Stuart   | title =Te Peeke o Aotearoa - The Bank of King Tawhiao  | journal = New Zealand Journal of History  | volume = 26  | pages = 161–183 | publisher = Department of History, University of Auckland| location =  | date = October 1992   | url = http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/docs/1992/NZJH_26_2_04.pdf | accessdate = 16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pōtatau was succeeded at his death in 1860 by [[Tāwhiao|Matutaera Tāwhiao]], whose 34-year reign coincided with the military [[Invasion of Waikato|invasion of the Waikato]], which was partly aimed at crushing the Kingitanga movement, with the government viewing it as a challenge to the supremacy of the British monarchy. Five Māori monarchs have subsequently held the throne, including [[Dame Te Atairangikaahu]], who reigned for 40 years until her death in 2006. Her son Tūheitia is the current king.  The historic traditions such as the poukai (annual visits by the monarch to marae) and the koroneihana (coronation celebrations) continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Papa and Meredith|first=Rahui and Paul|title='Kīngitanga – the Māori King movement - Te Ātairangikaahu, 1966–2006, and Tūheitia, 2006–|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/kingitanga-the-maori-king-movement/page-7|work=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand| publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage | accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Māori monarch is a non-constitutional role with no legal power from the perspective of the New Zealand government. Reigning monarchs retain the position of paramount chief of several important tribes and wield some power over these, especially within Tainui.&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{cite web|last=Foster|first=Bernard|title=TE KĪNGITANGA|url=http://www.naumaiplace.com/site/owairaka/home/page/731/king-movement/|work=TE KĪNGITANGA|publisher=Department of Internal Affairs, Wellington|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/the-maori-king-movement/te-kingitanga/introduction|title=NZ History – The Māori King Movement|publisher=Ministry of Culture and Heritage|date=3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of children===
The records of early European visitors suggest that Māori children were indulged and led a rather carefree life, full of play. An early French explorer, Julien Crozet, commented that ‘[the women] seemed to be good mothers and showed affection for their offspring. I have often seen them play with the children, caress them, chew the fern root, pick at the stringy parts, and then take it out of their mouth to put it into that of their nurslings. The men were also very fond of and kind to their children.’ French missionary Jean-Simon Bernard wrote, disapprovingly, in 1844: ‘The children here are completely free; the parents never do anything to them. They never beat them and do not allow anyone else to beat them.’ &lt;ref name="Two Worlds"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salmond|first=Anne|title=Two worlds: first meetings between Maori and Europeans, 1642–1772|year=1993|publisher=Viking|location=Auckland|page=422|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/nga-matua-maori-parenting/page-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Paul Moon writes of reports by missionaries of  young girls being forced  into the sex trade  by their families with the object of obtaining valuable  and scarce English goods in the 1820s. He describes how, when a new ship arrived, the fathers came to take girls as young as 10 out of school.&lt;ref name=Moon&gt;{{cite book|last=Moon|first=Paul|title=A Savage Country: The Untold Story of New Zealand in the 1820s|year=2012|publisher=Penguin|location=New Zealand|isbn=0143567381|pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moon says that infanticide was widespread in Maori settlements—particularly the killing of baby girls, slaves captured in battle or half-caste children.&lt;ref&gt;This Horrid Practice p 123-124. P. Moon. Penguin. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Census figures in the 19th century showed a marked male/female imbalance throughout the North Island amongst Māori children.&lt;ref&gt;Maori Abortion Practices in pre and early European New Zealand, R. Hunton, NZ Medical Journal, December 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1857-8 Maori census recorded 32,329 males and only 23,928 females.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics of Nz for 1861. Taken from the 1857–58 Native census. Aboriginal Native Population. Appendix H.&lt;/ref&gt;

The killing of children could be the take (cause) of war. In 1815 two Ngāti Maniapoto boys were killed by the north Taranaki Ngati Tama iwi while they were visiting friends at Motuawa near the Mokau heads. This led to a Ngāti Maniapoto reprisal raid when warriors pretended to be peaceful visitors and launched a surprise attack on Ngati Tama.&lt;ref&gt;. Tainui. L. Kelly. p. 297-298.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of whāngai (adopting or fostering children) has been, and still is, important within Māori whānau. It is the practice of raising nieces, nephews, cousins and other wider-family members as if they were members of the immediate family. Whāngai are adopted children who are raised with a whānau, most often as another member of that whānau, like a brother or sister.&lt;ref name="Te Ara Maori Parenting"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiro|first=Cindy|title=Ngā mātua – Māori parenting - Whānau and whāngai|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/nga-matua-maori-parenting/page-2|work=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand| publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage | accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1978 to 1987 the Māori child-homicide rate was 1.15 times the non-Māori rate. However, between 1991 and 2000, the Māori rate rose to more than 3.5 times the non-Māori rate and from 2001 to 2005 the Māori child-homicide rate was around 2.4 times that of non-Māori.&lt;ref name="Te Ara Maori Parenting" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiro|first=Cindy|title='Ngā mātua – Māori parenting - Abuse and discipline|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/nga-matua-maori-parenting/page-4|work=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand| publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage | accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of a response to these statistics, national Māori child-advocacy organisation Te Kāhui Mana Ririki was formed in 2008.

===Tā Moko===
Face carving/tattooing was a traditional practice especially by men of rank but also by women. The facial tattoo gives details of the wearers lineage status, origin and possibly exploits.&lt;ref&gt;A Savage Country.P. Moon. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the arrival of Europeans tattooing was a  sacred activity with many rituals.

=== Mokomokai ===
Later in their desire to obtain European muskets and powder in the 1820s, northern Māori produced a profusion of tattooed severed heads for sale to traders. At least two different methods of preserving heads were used. The head was severed from the body and emptied of its contents, with the nostrils and inside of the skull stuffed with flax. At the neck the skin was sewn together to allow a passage for the hand. Then it was rolled up in leaves and steamed at a low to moderate heat until all the moisture had gone. The head was either smoked over a fire or left in the air to dry. This caused the flesh to become hard and tough. The facial features, hair, and teeth were as perfect as in life, nor did they decay.&lt;ref&gt;''A Savage Country''. P. Moon. pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Various reasons have been put forward for the rationale behind the traditional use of dried dead heads. One possibility is that it was a reminder of the deceased, another as a trophy made from the heads of slain enemies. Enemies' heads were displayed on poles as a macabre totem of victory. A third possibility was that it was a ritualistic way of capturing the enemies' mana, as heads of chiefs in particular were very tapu. Heads might be returned in an effort to settle a tribal disagreement, but they were never traded.&lt;ref&gt;''A Savage Country''. P. Moon. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Māori quickly learnt that missionaries were repulsed by dried heads and hid them from view. In the 1820s, one European – Craik – was left with the impression that northern Māori had gone to war with the specific purpose of obtaining heads to trade for gunpowder. Another Māori offered to go and shoot some people who had killed his son if the European would give him some gunpowder to obtain heads. Māori quickly changed a centuries-old sacred practice to meet the demands for dried heads. The demand for military hardware by Māori seemed to override any older traditional practices or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;''A Savage Country''. P. Moon. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824 a French captain obtained an imperfect smoked head (it had been partly chewed by a dog) in exchange for one pound of gunpowder.&lt;ref&gt;''A Savage Country''. P. Moon. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
The normal Māori method of travel was on foot. The North Island had an extensive network of single lane one metre wide  tracks that traversed beaches, plains, valleys and mountain passes. Some of these tracks were used by many iwi and were considered neutral territory. Missionaries who travelled with Māori guides found that at river crossings canoes were left for the use of any traveller.&lt;ref&gt;Tainui. L. Kelly.2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1840 and 1850 numbers of explorers, artists, government officials including Governor Grey traveled inland with the aid of Maori guides. The guides carried heavy loads and would carry Europeans across creeks. Crossing swamps was common. Although they carried some food they relied on purchasing basic foodstuffs such as potatoes or native pigeons  from Maori settlements. The most popular payment was in tobacco which was in great demand. In more remote areas travelers sometimes found Maori living by themselves and growing a few potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;Voyages. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canoes (''[[waka (canoe)|waka]])'' were used extensively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waka-canoes/page-1 "Waka – canoes "], Te Ara&lt;/ref&gt; These ranged from small river-going boats, to the large ''waka taua'' sea-going war vessels carrying up to 80 paddlers, and up to {{convert|40|m|ft}} long&lt;ref&gt;.[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waka-canoes/3 "Waka taua"], Te Ara&lt;/ref&gt; Waka were used extensively for long range travel down the east coast and to cross Cook Strait. In 1822-23 Te Rauparaha who had established a base by capturing Kapiti Island, reconnoitered the upper South Island in waka before launching a seaborne invasion the following year against Ngai Tahu and Rangitane iwi. Te Rauparahaa later hired a European ship to attack Akoroa Harbour.&lt;ref&gt;Penguin History of New Zealand. M. King. This showed that Te Rauparaha was prepared to use Western technology to further his own  goals.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] who followed several war parties reported as many as 50 waka taua travelling together at one time, although he reported they only went out to sea in relatively calm weather. From 1835 large numbers of European ships entered the Bay of Islands every year with Henry Williams reporting an average of 70-80 ships per year. Many Māori men worked on the ships, with a reported average of eight Māori seamen per whaling ship. 10m long whaleboats began to be used by Māori. They could be both rowed and sailed.&lt;ref&gt;The Meeting Place.V.O'Malley.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s as Māori with the active encouragement of Grey embraced trade were gradually able to develop a large fleet of small trading schooners and similar craft. All the initial European centres had been supported by Maori. In Auckland and Northland Māori dominated shipping trade. In 1851 51 vessels were registered and 30 smaller vessels licensed. By 1857 there were 37 schooners. The fleet increased steadily during the Tasman trade boom of 1853–56. Māori paid customs duties to the government and invested heavily in vessels, so suffered considerably when a dramatic market slump hit New Zealand especially effecting the Auckland -Waikato- Hauraki area.&lt;ref&gt;Climates of War. E. Bohan.p36-37.&lt;/ref&gt; During the musket war period and for a time afterwards, Maori,  isolated from their tribal support by these devastating conflicts, hid in isolated places, living off patches of vegetables they grew in tiny gardens. This practice was very common in Taranaki which had been devastated by Waikato attacks in particular. European explorers, such as Dieffenbach, often stumbled upon these survivors while exploring. He described these whare as hotbeds for rats and vermin.&lt;ref&gt;P. Moon. p. 111. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buildings===
The traditional Māori whare continued to be used in rural areas in particular well into the post contact period. They were usually very small with a dirt floor and full of vermin, especially fleas. In winter a central fire was lit that filled the whare with smoke which slowly filtered through the roof.&lt;ref&gt;Voyagers. p 157. P. Moon Penguin 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Even as late as 1849 George Cooper the assistant private secretary to George Grey described a village in the relatively affluent lower Eastern Waihou River area as "a wretched place, containing about a dozen miserable raupo huts all tumbling to pieces".&lt;ref&gt;Voyages.p 211. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 11. In the 19th century settlements were hapu-based, and 5 buildings became standardized-the sleeping whare, Kauta or communal cookhouse/shelter, whata or wood store, pataka or storehouse and increasingly from the 1870s wharepuni or community meeting house. Significant finance and mana was invested in increasingly elaborate meeting houses which became a source of hapu or iwi pride and prestige. A meeting house was likely to have  outside carvings and increasingly as European tools were used, intricate interior carving and woven panels depicting  tribal history. Rotorua became a centre of carving excellence under the encouragement of the Māori MPs in the Young Māori party. Intinerant specialist carvers travelled widely, employing their skills in many locations. Meeting houses became places for tribal celebrations or political meetings, especially after the 1860s Land Wars. They were a place to display largesse and enhance  mana with elaborate feasts and entertainment. By the 20th century Wharepuni were common and averaged 18–24m long by 8m wide. There were no Māori buildings of this size in pre European days.
As Māori became familiar with European building construction and design they incorporated features such as chimneys and fireplaces and made use of bigger doorways and windows as well as sawn timber but even by the turn of the 19th century toilet facilities were often primitive, despite the urgings of the Māori MPs Pomare and Ngata who worked hard to improve the standard of Māori dwellings over their many years in office.&lt;ref&gt;Nga Iwi O Te Motu. p47 M. King. Reed.  Auckland 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maori MPs.NZ History online.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clothing===
{{see also|Māori traditional textiles}}
From the early sealing days Māori working in sealing camps in the South Island had adopted European style clothing. Traditional clothing made from flax and dog skins had gone out of common use by 1850 everywhere. This type of clothing took a long time to make and did not offer much protection or warmth. European clothing had become widely available from itinerant peddlers who also sold pipes, tobacco, axes, billies, buckets and other household items Māori could not make. The blanket was the most common item in use. It was worn as a kilt, cloak or shawl. Blankets were used at night to partly replace the fires lit inside a sleeping whare which, without chimneys, "had a detrimental effect on eyesight and lungs". From the end of the 19th century and continuing into the present, traditional clothing is only used on ceremonial occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Nga Iwi O Te Motu. p46-47.M. King. Reed. Auckland. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural changes in the 20th century==
[[File:New Zealand Maori Culture 002 (5397152967).jpg|thumb|Modern Māori culture]]

Māori continued to experience significant cultural change during this century. In 1900 few Māori lived in urban settlements. It was rare for any Māori to live in a European settlement. This changed very slowly. There were only 1,766 Māori in Auckland in 1935. By 1936 only 11.2% of Māori lived in urban areas. By 1945 this had risen to 19% and by 1971 to 68%. These changes reflect a significant alteration in the basis for income and employment-from working on hapu-based rural land to working mainly in construction, freezing works or labouring. The dominant factors influencing this shift were the burgeoning Māori population and the inability of the land to support the increasing population. During the 1930s and 1940s MP Ngata had passed land legislation to help Māori make better use of their remaining tribal land. Māori were handicapped in using and developing the land for modern agriculture as much Māori land was steep, remote, erosion prone with high rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;Nga Iwi O Te Motu. pp. 101-107. M. King. Reed. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  European farmers who owned their land freehold mechanized to gain higher productivity, using bank loans for the new equipment. Māori were unable to gain loans as their land was generally tribal land and could not be used for securing individual loans. Leasing land to European farmers gave Māori a steady income but this was spread among many people. 
Māori farming was often based on a different system of values and  not driven by European goals of efficiency and high productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Nga Iwi O Te Motu. p. 103 M. King.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from jobs, another  attraction to urban migration were the monetary, recreational and lifestyle attractions of the city. Many Māori felt that success lay in the city rather than the country. King describes this as a "fantasy contagion-the realty did not live up to the myth but this did not stop the fantasy or the migration".&lt;ref&gt;Nga Iwi O Te Motu. p 104.M. King. Reed. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other changes were a rising birth rate. In 1955, the Māori birth rate was nearly double the European rate at 43.6 compared to 26 per 1000. At the same time Māori had less qualifications. In 1956  6.5% of Māori held professional, managerial or clerical jobs compared to 26.7% non Māori. As a result, only 3.36% of Māori earned 700 pounds or more per annum compared to 18.6% for non Māori.&lt;ref&gt;King. p 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
Māori were significantly impacted by changing economic circumstances such as the drop in wool prices. This made Māori more vulnerable to economic and social deprivation. King says that the lower Māori educational attainment lead to lower income jobs, which led to lower income, poor housing, and poor health, which in turn led to higher rates of crime.&lt;ref&gt;King p 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

These ingredients were potential causes of racial tension. They were seen by the wider community as "Māori problems". By the 1970s and 1980s enough urbanized Māori had reached positions of influence to bring about a gradual but radical change to the thinking of governments. Their advocacy was underscored by an increasing willingness to use vigorous protest to push Mana Māori. Young urban radicals beat up a group of University students taking a comical view of Māori dance. Protestors occupied Bastion Point which was claimed as Māori land and resisted police arrest. In Raglan local Māori protesters reclaimed ownership of land used as an airstrip and golf course.

Educated urban Māori advocated the teaching of Māori language and the inclusion of a Māori point of view in all aspects of education.
Māori began to express their ideas in new political movements with Māori voters switching from supporting the Labour party to alternatives such as the Māori lead New Zealand First party in 1992. The introduction of MMP (Mixed Member Proportional) elections in 1996 had the effect of giving minority groups of any shades, more influence. The 1996 election produced 14 Māori MPs with 3 in cabinet. Māori MP Winston Peters, was the deputy Prime minister. This gave Māori an unprecedented voice in the nation's political executive.
 
This position set high expectations for positive results from the Treaty of Waitangi Tribunal which was set up to investigate Māori grievances against historical New Zealand governments in relation to the treaty. From the early 1990s a series of favourable outcomes from the treaty tribunal resulted in a large flow of capital in the form of land, primary resources and cash from the government to various Māori iwi and hapu.&lt;ref&gt;Nga Iwi O Te Motu. pp. 115-118. M. King. Reed. Auckland. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest tribal deals approached $1 billion although many were far smaller. This gave iwi and hapu organizations a source of financial security they had not had previously. To 2013 the total paid by government exceeds $4 billion. These resulted in more cohesive tribal organization as all assets went to tribal or hapu organizations. In 2012 it was estimated that the total value of Māori controlled assets was about $400 billion.

From the early 1970s [[Māori protest movement|a new generation of radicals]] arose demanding more Māori influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/maori-language-week/history-of-the-maori-language|title=Māori Language Week – History of the Māori language|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the demands were for increased "tino rangatiratanga". The expression, an abstraction of the word for aristocracy, had been coined by Henry Williams in the Treaty of Waitangi to convey the idea of "chieftainship".  However, the term was often used by Māori to express the idea of political rights for all Māori not just the rangatira class, or the idea of Māori sovereignty or Māori independence.

==Marae==
[[File:TeAuoteWhenua2.jpg|thumb|right|A carved representation in contemporary style of Te Au-o-te-whenua, an ancestor of the Kawerau-ā-Maki people.]]

{{Main|Marae}}
The most appropriate venue for any Māori cultural event is a ''[[marae]]'', which is an enclosed area of land where a meeting house or ''[[wharenui]]'' (literally "big house") stands. A ''marae'' is the centre for much of Māori community life. Generally the [[Māori language]] is used in ceremonies and speeches, although translations and explanations are provided when the primary participants are not Māori speakers. Increasingly, New Zealand schools and universities have their own ''marae'' to facilitate the teaching of Māori language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tourism.net.nz/new-zealand/about-new-zealand/maori-culture.html|title=Maori Culture New Zealand, Maori Culture, Traditions and Tourism|last=Guide|first=New Zealand Tourism|website=www.tourism.net.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''marae'' is a communal ceremonial centre where meetings and ceremonies take place in accordance with traditional protocols. The ''marae'' symbolises group unity and generally consists of an open cleared area in front of a large carved meeting house, along with a dining hall and other facilities necessary to provide a comfortable stay for visiting groups. On the marae official functions take place including formal welcomes, celebrations, weddings, christenings, reunions, and ''[[tangihanga]]'' (funerals). The older people have the authority on the marae, and they impart, primarily through [[oral tradition]], traditions and cultural practices to the young people. These include [[genealogy]], [[spirituality]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], and politics, and arts such as [[music composition]], performance, [[weaving]], or carving.

=== Marae protocols ===
The details of the protocols, called "''tikanga''"&lt;ref name="Mead2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mead|first=S. M.|title=Tikanga Māori: Living by Māori values|year=2003|page=8|publisher=Huia Publishers|location=Wellington, New Zealand|isbn=1-877283-88-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "''kawa''",&lt;ref name="Mead2003" /&gt; vary by [[iwi]] but in all cases locals and visitors have to respect certain rules especially during the rituals of encounter. When a group of people come to stay on a marae, they are considered ''manuhiri'' (guests) while the hosts of the marae are known as ''[[tāngata whenua|tangata whenua]]''. Should other groups of manuhiri arrive, the ''manuhiri'' who arrived previously are considered ''tangata whenua'' for the purposes of formally welcoming the new group.

=== Marae food ===
Although marae have modern cooking facilities, the traditional ''[[hāngi]]''  is still used to provide meals for large groups because the food it produces is considered flavourful. The hāngi consists of a shallow hole dug in the ground, in which a fire is prepared and stones are placed on the top. When the stones are hot, prepared food is placed on top of them, meat first and then vegetables such as the kūmara, potatoes and pumpkin. The hāngi is then covered with leaves or mats woven out of [[Flax in New Zealand|harakeke flax]], or wet sacks, and soil is then heaped over the hāngi to seal in the heat to cook the food.

=== Marae events ===
Like in pre-European times, marae continue to be the location of many ceremonial events, including birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries. The most important event located at marae are [[tangihanga]]. Tangihanga are the means by which the dead are farewelled and the surviving family members supported in Māori society. As indicated by Ka'ai and Higgins, "the importance of the tangihanga and its central place in marae custom is reflected in the fact that it takes precedence over any other gathering on the marae" (p.&amp;nbsp;90).&lt;ref&gt;Ka'ai, T. M., &amp; Higgins, R. (2004). Te ao Māori – Māori world-view. In T. M. Ka'ai, J. C. Moorfield, M. P. J. Reilly, &amp; S. Mosely (Eds.), ''Ki te whaiao: An introduction to Māori culture and society'' (pp. 13–25). Auckland. New Zealand: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marae oral tradition ===
The history of individual tribal groups is kept by means of narratives, songs and chants, hence the importance of music, story and poetry. Oratory, the making of speeches, is especially important in the rituals of encounter, and it is regarded as important for a speaker to include allusions to traditional narrative and to a complex system of proverbial sayings, called ''whakataukī''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.korero.maori.nz/forlearners/proverbs.html "Whakataukī – Proverbs"], korero.maori.nz website&lt;/ref&gt; Oral traditions include songs, calls, chants, haka and formalised speech patterns that recall the history of the people.

==Events and activities==
Significant Māori cultural events or activities include:

*The "[[tangihanga|tangi]]" is a Maori funeral. It almost always takes place on the home marae of the deceased. The rituals followed are essentially Christian. The tangi begins with a powhiri to welcome guests. It is normal for Maori to travel very long distances to attend the tangi of a loved one. Often black clothes are worn, following Victorian practices. Guests will speak formally about the deceased on the Marae atea often referring to tribal history and using humour. Pathos is commonly used to create a feeling of comfort and unity. Speeches are supported by Waiata(songs). The whanau of the deceased sit by the coffin on the wharenui porch but do not speak or reply. The family may often hold or display photos of the deceased or important ancestors. A tangi may go on for several days, especially for a person of great mana. Rainfall during a tangi is seen as a divine sign of sorrow.&lt;ref&gt;Te Ara, The Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Tangihanga death customs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8630203/Understanding-a-tangi Stuff NZ. Understanding a Tangi] May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''hui'' or meeting, usually on a ''marae''. It begins with a ''[[pōwhiri]]'' (a welcome). If a visitor is noteworthy, he or she may be welcomed with an aggressive challenge by a warrior armed with a ''[[taiaha]]'' (traditional fighting staff), who then offers a token of peace, such as a fern frond, to the visitor. Acceptance of the token in the face of such aggression is a demonstration of the courage and ''[[mana]]'' (authority, charisma, prestige, dignity) of the visitor. The ''pōwhiri'' is highly structured, with speeches from both hosts and guests following a traditional format, their sequence dictated by the ''kawa'' (protocol) of that place, and followed by ''[[Māori music|waiata]]'', songs. ''Hui'' are held for business, for festivities or for rites of passage such as baptism, marriage and death. It is appreciated if foreign guests can say a few words in Māori and sing a song they are familiar with as a group.
* The ''[[haka]]'' – an action chant, often described as a "war dance", but more a chant with hand gestures and foot stomping, originally performed by warriors before a battle, proclaiming their strength and prowess by way of abusing the opposition. Now, this procedure is regularly performed by New Zealand representatives of [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[rugby league]] teams before a game begins. There are many different ''haka''; though, one, "''Ka mate''" by [[Te Rauparaha]], is much more widely known than any other.
* ''[[Kapa haka]]'' (''[[haka]]'' groups) often come together to practice and perform cultural items such as ''waiata'' or songs, especially action songs, and ''haka'' for entertainment. ''[[Poi (performance art)|Poi]]'' dances may also form part of the repertoire. Traditional instruments sometime accompany the group, though the guitar is also commonly used. Many New Zealand schools now have a ''kapa haka'' as part of the Māori studies curriculum. Today, national ''kapa haka'' competitions are held where groups are judged to find the best performers; these draw large crowds. The common expression "''kapa haka group''" is strictly speaking, a [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]].
* ''[[Koha (custom)|Koha]]'' are gifts to the hosts, often of food or traditional items, though money is most commonly used today. Traditionally, the essence of ''koha'' is that it is voluntary and comes from the heart, so to specify the amount is contrary to its spirit. Increasingly, it is common for the koha to be a fixed sum per head that is communicated to the guests in private, so there is no embarrassment. Recipients rely on the donors' ''[[Māori language|aroha]]'' (empathy), ''manaakitanga'' (cherishing) and ''wairua'' (spirit) to ensure that it is enough. Thanks for ''koha'' are accordingly warm.
* [[Matariki]], "Māori New Year", celebrates the first rising of the [[Pleiades]] in late May or early June. Traditionally the actual time for the celebration of Matariki varies, with some [[iwi]] celebrating it immediately, others waiting until the rising of the next [[full moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maoriparty.org/index.php?pag=nw&amp;id=1116&amp;p=hon-tariana-turia-weekly-beehive-chat-stars-are-set-for-a-happy-maori-new-year.html|title=Stars are set for a happy Māori New Year |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716084848/http://www.maoriparty.org/index.php?pag=nw&amp;id=1116&amp;p=hon-tariana-turia-weekly-beehive-chat-stars-are-set-for-a-happy-maori-new-year.html |archive-date=16 July 2011 |author=[[Tariana Turia]] |date=|website=maoriparty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/ranginui-the-sky/4/4 |title=Winter stars – Ranginui – the sky | work=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage |date=2012-11-14 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a day where they pay respect to the people they have lost but also gain over the last year that has passed.

The '''national anthem of Guatemala''' was written by [[José Joaquín Palma]] (1844–1911) and composed by Rafael Álvarez Ovalle..

==Etymology==
The anthem is often erroneously titled "Guatemala Feliz!" from its opening lyrics, but the anthem has no official name and is only referred to in the country as the ''Himno Nacional''.

==History==
The anthem was adopted in 1896 as the winning entry in a competition held by the government. The lyrics were modified slightly in 1934 by Professor Jose Maria Bonilla Ruano, a Spanish grammar scholar. Some verses were softened in their bloody context while others were enhanced in their poetic beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalanthems.info/gt.htm |title=Guatemala |publisher=nationalanthems.info |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the author of the song's original lyrics was not known until 1911, when on his deathbed, [[José Joaquín Palma]] revealed that he had authored the lyrics.
&lt;!--
In 1879, the literary society "El Porvenir" tried unsuccessfully to create a national anthem for Guatemala. Until 1889, the president of [[Guatemala]], general [[Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián]], called a competition to choose the music that would complement the lyrics of a poem written by the poet Ramón P. Molina. In this contest distinguished composers took part, and the winner was awarded to the music presented by [[Rafael Álvarez Ovalle]].

In 1896, the government of General [[José María Reyna Barrios | José María Reina Barrios]] called for a new contest, "Considering that a National Anthem is lacking in [[Guatemala]], because that which is still known today that name, not only suffers from notable defects, but has not been officially declared as such; and that it is convenient to endow the country with a hymn that, because of its lyrics and music, responds to the lofty ends in which all cultured people offer this kind of compositions. Of this new contest the work of [[Rafael Álvarez Ovalle]] was awarded again, this time musicalizing a poem protected by the pseudonym "Anonymous".

The triumph granted again to maestro Álvarez Ovalle cost him the most bitter moments of his existence, as there was discontent among those who did not win, who even made their complaint reach the first president. Reina Barrios, in the presence of the members of her cabinet, other personalities and masters of musical art, returned to listen to all the compositions that competed in the contest, having been elected again unanimously, that of the maestro [[Rafael Álvarez Ovalle]].

Regarding the lyrics, the qualifying jury determined the following:

{{quote|
Text of the report rendered by the jury that qualified the literary contest, composed of Messrs. F. Castañeda, J. Joaquín Palma and José Leonard.

«Guatemala, October 27, 1896.
Mr. Minister of Public Instruction.
Present. &lt;br /&gt;
In compliance with the honorable commission with which you served to favor us, entrusting us with the qualification of the "national anthems" presented to this secretariat, by virtue of the contest opened by the agreement of July 24 last, we have examined the twelve compositions that object you had to send us with date 15 of the current one. Encouraged by the best wishes, and with the aim of making the designation required by the aforementioned agreement, we have met several times, and after a long and careful examination, we have the honor of manifesting to you that, in our opinion, the hymn that begins with the words '' Happy Guatemala '' and takes the foot of '' Anonymous '' in parentheses, is the one that best responds to the conditions of the call and deserves, therefore, the prize offered. So we have the honor of issuing the report that the secretariat of his worthy position asked us, writing us with all consideration and appreciation, Mr. Minister, very attentive and safe servers. &lt;br /&gt;
José Leonard, J. J. Palma, F. Castañeda ».}}

As can be seen, the Cuban poet [[José Joaquín Palma]] was a member of the qualifying jury.

The premiere of the National Anthem took place in the literary lyric act celebrated in the [[Teatro Colón (Guatemala)]] on Sunday night, March 14, 1897, as one of the main points of the program of celebrations of the [[Central American Exhibition ]], having been awarded the gold medal and honor diploma by the teacher [[Rafael Álvarez Ovalle]].

The author of the lyrics of the National Anthem of Guatemala remained in the deepest mystery until [[1911]], in which it was discovered that its author was the poet [[José Joaquín Palma]], as it revealed on his deathbed he was the author of the lyrics of the hymn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12773">The '''obsolete Finnish units of measurement''' consist mostly of a variety of units traditionally used in [[Finland]] that are similar to those that were traditionally used in other countries and are still used in the United Kingdom ([[imperial units]]) and the United States ([[United States customary units]]).

Very few of these units are sometimes still used in everyday speech and even when buying and measuring things as shorthand for similar amounts in the metric system. For example, ''kappa'' (sometimes called ''isokappa'') is still used at markets to measure exactly 5 liters of potatoes. When ordering firewood, some customers (and even dealers) use ''syli'' to refer to a cubic meter, but some old people use the term to refer to various much larger amounts of firewood.

Most Finnish obsolete units of measurement were identical to [[Swedish units of measurement]], including units of length being based on the Swedish "foot" (29.69&amp;nbsp;cm) that was defined in 1605, since Finland was part of Sweden from the Middle Ages to 1809, but later some [[Obsolete Russian weights and measures|Russian]] units were also used.

The measurements were first standardized by law in 1665 and were revised in 1735. Before this, measurements often varied between towns. The king's bailiff in the town of [[Porvoo]], for example, used two sets of measures: a big one for collecting tax in kind from the populace and a smaller set to remit the assets to the king, keeping the difference for himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} However, nowadays the proverb ''mitata Porvoon mitalla'' (to measure in Porvoo units) has a positive meaning of measuring in excess or generously.

Certain units were standardized to the [[metric system]] in 1861, and Finland fully converted to the metric system in 1880.

'''Old French''' ({{lang|fro|franceis}}, {{lang|fro|françois}}, {{lang|fro|romanz}}; [[French language|Modern French]]: {{lang|fr|ancien français}}) was the language spoken in Northern France from the 8th century to the 14th century.  
In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the ''[[langue d'oïl]]'', contrasting with the ''[[langue d'oc]]'' or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to [[Middle French]], the language of the [[French Renaissance]], specifically based on the dialect of the [[Île-de-France]] region.

The place and area where Old French was spoken natively roughly extended to the northern half of the [[Kingdom of France]] and its vassals (including parts of the [[Angevin Empire]], which during the 12th century remained under [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] rule), and the duchies of [[Upper Lorraine|Upper]] and [[Lower Lorraine]] to the east (corresponding to modern north-eastern [[France]] and Belgian [[Wallonia]]), but the influence of Old French was much wider, as it was carried to [[Norman England|England]],  [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and the [[Crusader states]] as the language of a feudal elite and of commerce.{{sfn|Kinoshita|2006|p=3}}

==Areal and dialectal divisions==
{{further information|Langue d'oïl|Gallo-Romance}}
[[File:Map France 1180-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of France in 1180, at the height of the [[feudalism|feudal system]].
The [[crown lands of France|possessions of the French king]] are in light blue, vassals to the French king in green, [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] possessions in red. Shown in white is the [[Holy Roman Empire]] to the east, the western fringes of which, including [[Upper Burgundy]] and [[duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], were also part of the Old French areal.]]

The [[areal linguistics|areal]] of Old French in contemporary terms corresponded to the northern parts of the [[medieval France|Kingdom of France]] (including [[Anjou]] and [[duchy of Normandy|Normandy]], which in the 12th century were ruled by the [[Angevin Empire|Plantagenet kings of England]]), [[Upper Burgundy]] and the [[duchy of Lorraine]]. The [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman dialect]] was also spread to [[Norman England|England]] and [[Norman Ireland|Ireland]], and during the [[crusades]], Old French was also spoken in  the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], and in the [[Principality of Antioch]] and the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in the [[Outremer|Levant]].
 
As part of the emerging [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]] dialect continuum, the ''langues d'oïl''  were contrasted with the  ''[[Occitan language|langue d'oc]]'' (the emerging [[Occitano-Romance languages|Occitano-Romance]] group, at the time also called [[Provençal (dialect)|Provençal]]), adjacent to the Old French area in the south-west, and with the [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic]] group to the south-east. The [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]] group developed in Upper Burgundy, sharing features with both French and Provençal; it may have begun to diverge from the  ''langue d'oïl''  as early as the 9th century, and is attested as a distinct Gallo-Romance variety by the 12th century.

Dialects or variants of Old French included:
*[[Burgundian language (Oïl)|Burgundian]] in [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], then an independent [[duchy]] whose capital was at [[Dijon]];
*[[Picard language|Picard]] of [[Picardy]], whose principal cities were [[Calais]] and [[Lille]]. It was said that the Picard language began at the east door of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], so far-reaching was its influence;
*[[Old Norman]], in [[Normandy]], whose principal cities were [[Caen]] and [[Rouen]]. The [[Norman conquest]] of [[England]] brought many Norman-speaking aristocrats into the British Isles. Most of the older Norman (sometimes called "French") words in [[English language|English]] reflect its influence, which became a conduit for the introduction into the Anglo-Norman realm, as did Anglo-Norman control of Anjou and Gascony and other continental possessions. [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] was a language that reflected a shared culture on both sides of the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref name="Lusignan"&gt;Lusignan, Serge. ''La langue des rois au Moyen Âge: Le français en France et en Angleterre''. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the language declined and fell, becoming [[Law French]], a jargon spoken by lawyers that was used in [[English law]] until the reign of [[Charles II of England]]. [[Norman language|Norman]], however, still survives in Normandy and the [[Channel Islands]], as a regional language; 
*[[Walloon language|Wallon]], around [[Namur (city)|Namur]], now in [[Wallonia]], [[Belgium]];
*[[Gallo language|Gallo]] of the [[Duchy of Brittany]];
*[[Lorrain language|Lorrain]] of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]].

==History==
===Evolution from Vulgar Latin===
Beginning with [[Plautus]]’s time (254–184 {{smallcaps|b.c.}}), one can see phonological changes between [[Classical Latin]] and what is called [[Vulgar Latin]], the common spoken language of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Vulgar Latin differed from Classical Latin in phonology and morphology as well as exhibiting lexical differences. However they were mutually intelligible until the 7th century when Classical Latin 'died' as a daily spoken language, and had to be learned as a second language (though it was long thought of as the formal version of the spoken language).&lt;ref&gt;Jozsef Herman, Trans. Roger Wright, Vulgar Latin, 1997, 'The end of the history of Latin,' pp. 109-115, {{ISBN|0-271-02000-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vulgar Latin was the ancestor of the [[Romance languages]], including Old French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iedo.brillonline.nl/dictionaries/content/latin/index.html |title=Brill Online Dictionaries |publisher=Iedo.brillonline.nl |accessdate=2013-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617111122/http://iedo.brillonline.nl/dictionaries/content/latin/index.html |archivedate=2013-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/508379/Romance-languages |title=Romance languages - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzU3RIV2BWIC&amp;q=down+the+spine#v=snippet&amp;q=%22The%20predominance%20of%20the%20Latin%20language%22&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Italic |title=Definition of Italic in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English) |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Romance |title=Definition of Romance in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English) |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Latin influences===
==== Gaulish ====
{{further information|List of French words of Gaulish origin}}

Some [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] words influenced Vulgar Latin and, through this, other Romance languages. For example, classical Latin ''[[wikt:equus|equus]]'' was uniformly replaced in Vulgar Latin by ''[[wikt:caballus|caballus]]'' ‘nag, work horse’, derived from Gaulish ''caballos'' (cf. [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|ceffyl}}, [[Breton language|Breton]] {{lang|br|kefel}}),&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise''. Paris: Errance, 2003, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; giving Modern French ''[[wikt:cheval|cheval]]'', Occitan ''caval'' (''chaval''), Catalan ''[[wikt:cavall|cavall]]'', Spanish ''[[wikt:caballo|caballo]]'', Portuguese ''[[wikt:cavalo|cavalo]]'', Italian ''[[wikt:cavallo|cavallo]]'', Romanian ''[[wikt:cal|cal]]'', and, by extension, English ''[[wikt:cavalry|cavalry]]''.
An estimated 200 words of Gaulish etymology survive in modern French, for example [[wikt:chêne|''chêne'']] ‘oak tree’ and [[wikt:charrue|''charrue'']] ‘plough’.&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre (2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;389–90) lists 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Within historical phonology and studies of [[language contact]], various phonological changes have been posited as caused by a Gaulish substrate, although there is some debate. One of these is considered certain, because this fact is clearly attested in the Gaulish-language [[epigraphy]] on the pottery found at [[la Graufesenque]] ({{small|A.D.}} 1st century). There, the Greek word ''paropsid-es'' (written in Latin) appears as ''paraxsid-i''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Yves Lambert]], ''La Langue gauloise'' (Paris: Errance, 1994), 46-7. {{ISBN|978-2-87772-224-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consonant clusters /ps/ and /pt/ shifted to /xs/ and /xt/, e.g. Latin ''capsa'' &gt; ''*kaxsa'' &gt; ''caisse'' ({{abbr|≠|unlike}} Italian ''cassa'') or ''captīvus'' &gt; ''*kaxtivus'' &gt; OF ''chaitif''&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; (mod. ''chétif''; cf. Irish ''cacht'' ‘servant’; ≠ Italian ''cattiv-ità'', Portuguese "cativo", Spanish ''cautivo''). This phonetic evolution is parallel to the shift of the Latin cluster /kt/ in Old French (Latin ''factum'' &gt; ''fait'', ≠ Italian ''fatto'', Portuguese ''feito'', Spanish ''hecho''; or ''lactem''* &gt; ''lait'', ≠ Italian ''latte'', Portuguese ''leite'', Spanish ''leche'').

The [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] [[Gaulish language]] is thought to have survived into the 6th century in France, despite considerable cultural Romanization.&lt;ref name=Helix&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurence Hélix| title=Histoire de la langue française|ISBN=978-2-7298-6470-5|publisher=Ellipses Edition Marketing S.A.|page=7|quote=Le déclin du Gaulois et sa disparition ne s'expliquent pas seulement par des pratiques culturelles spécifiques: Lorsque les Romains conduits par César envahirent la Gaule, au 1er siecle avant J.-C., celle-ci romanisa de manière progressive et profonde.

==== Frankish ====
{{further information|List of French words of Germanic origin}}

The pronunciation, vocabulary, and syntax of the Vulgar Latin spoken in [[Roman Gaul]] in [[Late Antiquity]] was modified by the [[Old Frankish language]], spoken by the [[Franks]] who settled in Gaul from the 5th century and conquered the entire Old French-speaking area by the 530s.
The name ''français'' itself is derived from the name the Franks.

The Old Frankish language had a definitive influence on the development of Old French, which partly explains why the earliest attested Old French documents are older than the earliest attestations in other Romance languages (e.g. [[Strasbourg Oath]]s, [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Cerquiglini]], ''La naissance du français'', Presses Universitaires de France, 2nd edn., chap. 3, 1993, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the result of an earlier gap created between Classical Latin and its evolved forms, which slowly reduced and eventually severed the intercomprehensibility between the two. The [[Old Dutch|Old Low Franconian]] influence is also believed to be responsible for the differences between the ''langue d′oïl'' and the [[Occitan language|''langue d′oc'']] (Occitan), being that various parts of Northern France remained bilingual between Latin and Germanic for some time,&lt;ref&gt;Cerquiglini 53&lt;/ref&gt; and these areas correspond precisely to where the first documents in Old French were written. 

This Germanic language shaped the popular Latin spoken here and gave it a very distinctive identity compared to the other future Romance languages. The very first noticeable influence is the substitution of the Latin melodic accent by a Germanic stress&lt;ref&gt;Cerquiglini 26.&lt;/ref&gt; and its result was [[diphthongization]], differentiation between long and short vowels, the fall of the unaccented syllable and of the final vowels:
* Latin ''decimus'', ''-a'' ‘tenth’ &gt; OF ''disme'' &gt; F ''dîme'' ‘tenth’ (&gt; E ''dime''; Italian ''decimo'', Portuguese ''décimo'', Spanish ''diezmo'')
* [[Vulgar Latin|VL]] ''dignitate'' &gt; OF ''deintié'' (&gt; E ''dainty''; Italian ''dignità'', Romanian ''demnitate'')
* VL ''catena'' &gt; OF ''chaeine'' (&gt; E ''chain''; Occitan, Portuguese ''cadeia'', Spanish ''cadena'', Italian ''catena'')

Additionally, two phonemes that had long since died out in Vulgar Latin were reintroduced: {{IPA|[h]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} (&gt; OF ''g(u)-'', ONF ''w-'' cf. [[Picard language|Picard]] ''w-''):
* VL ''altu'' &gt; OF ''halt'' ‘high’ (influenced by OLF ''*hōh'' ; ≠ Italian, Portuguese and Spanish ''alto'', Occitan ''naut'')
* L ''vespa'' &gt; F ''guêpe'', Picard ''wèpe'', Wallon ''wèsse'', all ‘wasp’ (influenced by OLF ''*wapsa'' ; ≠ Occitan ''vèspa'', Italian and Portuguese ''vespa'', Spanish ''avispa'')
* L ''viscus'' &gt; F ''gui'' ‘mistletoe’ (influenced by OLF ''*wīhsila'' ‘morello’ with analogous fruits, when they are not ripe; ≠ Occitan ''vesc'', Italian ''vischio'')
* LL ''vulpiculu'' ‘fox kit’ (from L ''vulpes'' ‘fox’) &gt; OF ''golpilz'', Picard ''woupil'' ‘fox’ (influenced by OLF ''*wulf'' ‘wolf’; ≠ Occitan ''volpìlh'', Old Italian ''volpiglio'', Spanish ''vulpeja'' ‘vixen’)

On the opposite, the Italian, Portuguese and Spanish words of Germanic origin borrowed from French or directly from Germanic retain {{IPA|/gw/}} ~ {{IPA|/g/}}, e.g. It, Sp. ''guerra'' ‘war’, alongside {{IPA|/g/}} in French ''guerre''). In these examples, we notice a clear consequence of bilingualism, that sometimes even changed the first syllable of the Latin words. One example of a Latin word influencing an Old Low Franconian loan is ''framboise'' ‘raspberry’, from OF ''frambeise'', from OLF ''*brāmbesi'' ‘blackberry’ (cf. Dutch ''braambes'', ''braambezie''; akin to German ''Brombeere'', English dial. ''bramberry'') blended with LL ''fraga'' or OF ''fraie'' ‘strawberry’, which explains the replacement {{IPA|[b]}} &gt; {{IPA|[f]}} and in turn the final ''-se'' of ''framboise'' added to OF ''fraie'' to make ''freise'', modern ''fraise'' (≠ Wallon ''frève'', Romanian ''fragă'', Romansh ''fraja'', Italian ''fragola'', ''fravola'' ‘strawberry’).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=frambuesa |title=Etymology of '&amp;#39;frambuesa'&amp;#39; (Spanish) |publisher=Buscon.rae.es |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Portuguese ''framboesa'' ‘raspberry’ and Spanish ''frambuesa'' are French loans.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope (1934) estimated that perhaps still 15% of the vocabulary of modern French derives from Germanic sources (while the proportion was larger in Old French, because the French language borrowed heavily from Latin and Italian).
&lt;!-- Nevertheless a large number of words like [[wiktionary:haïr|''haïr'']] "to hate" (≠ Latin ''odiare'' &gt; Italian ''odiare'' / Occitan ''asirar'') or [[wiktionary:honte|''honte'']] "shame" (≠ Latin ''verēcundia'' &gt; Occitan and Portuguese ''vergonha'', Italian ''vergogna'', Spanish ''vergüenza'') are still common.--&gt;

===Earliest written Old French===
At the third [[Council of Tours]] in 813, priests were ordered to preach in the vernacular language (either Romance or Germanic), since the common people could no longer understand formal Latin.

The earliest documents said to be written in the Gallo-Romance that prefigures French – after the [[Reichenau Glosses|Reichenau]] and [[Kassel glosses]] (8th and 9th centuries) – are the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] (treaties and charters into which King [[Charles the Bald]] entered in 842):

{{quote|Pro Deo amur et pro Christian poblo et nostro commun salvament, d’ist di en avant, in quant Deus savir et podir me dunat, si salvarai eo cist meon fradre Karlo, et in aiudha et in cadhuna cosa...

(For the love of God and for the Christian people, and our common salvation, from this day forward, as God will give me the knowledge and the power, I will defend my brother Charles with my help in everything...)}}

The second-oldest document in Old French is the [[Eulalia sequence]], which is important for linguistic reconstruction of Old French pronunciation due to its consistent spelling.

The royal [[House of Capet]], founded by [[Hugh Capet]] in 987, inaugurated the development of northern French culture in and around [[Île-de-France]], which slowly but firmly asserted its ascendency over the more southerly areas of [[Aquitaine]] and Tolosa ([[Toulouse]]). The [[Capetian dynasty|Capetians]]' ''[[langue d'oïl]]'', the forerunner of modern standard French, did not begin to become the common speech of all of France, however, until after the [[French Revolution]].

===Transition to Middle French===
{{further information|Middle French}}
In the Late Middle Ages, the Old French dialects diverged into a number of distinct ''langues d'oïl'', among which [[Middle French]] proper was the dialect of the [[Île-de-France]] region.
During the [[early modern France|Early Modern period]], French now becomes established as the official language of the Kingdom of France throughout the realm, also including the ''langue d'oc''-speaking territories in the south. 
It was only in the 17th to 18th centuries – with the development especially of popular literature of the ''[[Bibliothèque bleue]]'' – that a standardized [[Classical French]] spread throughout France alongside the regional dialects.

==Literature==
{{main article|Medieval French literature}}
The material and cultural conditions in [[territorial evolution of France|France and associated territories]] around the year 1100 triggered  what [[Charles Homer Haskins]] termed the "[[Renaissance of the 12th century]]", resulting in a profusion of creative works in a variety of genres. Old French gave way to [[Middle French]] in the mid-14th century, paving the way for early [[French Renaissance literature]] of the 15th century.

The earliest extant French literary texts date from the ninth century, but very few texts before the 11th century have survived. The first literary works written in Old French were [[hagiography|saints' lives]].  The ''[[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalie]]'', written in the second half of the 9th century, is generally accepted as the first such text.

At the beginning of the 13th century, [[Jean Bodel]], in his ''[[Chanson de Saisnes]]'', divided medieval French narrative literature into three subject areas: the [[Matter of France]] or Matter of [[Charlemagne]]; the [[Matter of Rome]] ([[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] in an ancient setting); and the [[Matter of Britain]] ([[Arthurian romance]]s and [[Breton lai]]s). The first of these is the subject area of the ''[[Chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]'' ("songs of exploits" or "songs of (heroic) deeds"), [[epic poem]]s typically composed in [[decasyllable|ten-syllable]] [[assonance]]d (occasionally [[rhyme]]d) ''[[laisse]]s''.  More than one hundred ''chansons de geste'' have survived in around three hundred manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;''La Chanson de Roland.'' Edited and Translated into Modern French by Ian Short.  Paris: Livre de Poche, 1990. p. 12.  {{ISBN|978-2-253-05341-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The oldest and most celebrated of the ''chansons de geste'' is ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' (earliest version composed in the late 11th century).

[[Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube]] in his ''[[Girart de Vienne]]'' set out a grouping of the ''chansons de geste'' into three [[literature cycle|cycle]]s: the ''Geste du roi'' centering on Charlemagne, the ''[[Geste de Garin de Monglane]]'' (whose central character was [[William of Gellone|William of Orange]]), and the ''Geste de [[Doon de Mayence]]'' or the "rebel vassal cycle", the  most famous characters of which were [[Renaud de Montauban]] and [[Girart de Roussillon]].
A fourth grouping, not listed by Bertrand, is the ''[[Crusade cycle]]'', dealing with the [[First Crusade]] and its immediate aftermath.

[[Jean Bodel]]'s other two categories—the "Matter of Rome" and the "Matter of Britain"—concern the French [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] or ''roman''. Around a hundred verse romances survive from the period 1150–1220.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Antoine Adam, Georges Lerminier, and Édouard Morot-Sir, eds. ''Littérature française.'' "Tome 1: Des origines à la fin du XVIIIe siècle," Paris: Larousse, 1967, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1200 on, the tendency was increasingly to write the romances in prose (many of the earlier verse romances were adapted into prose versions), although new verse romances continued to be written to the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Antoine Adam, Georges Lerminier, and Édouard Morot-Sir, eds. ''Littérature française.'' "Tome 1: Des origines à la fin du XVIIIe siècle," Paris: Larousse, 1967, p. 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The most important romance of the 13th century is the ''[[Romance of the Rose]]'' which breaks considerably from the conventions of the chivalric adventure story.

Medieval French [[lyric poetry]] was indebted to the poetic and cultural traditions in [[Southern France]] and [[Provence]]—including [[Toulouse]], [[Poitiers]], and the [[Aquitaine]] region—where ''langue d'oc'' was spoken ([[Occitan language]]); in their turn, the Provençal poets were greatly influenced by poetic traditions from the [[Muslim Spain|Hispano-Arab world]].  
The Occitan or Provençal poets were called [[troubadour]]s, from the word ''trobar'' "to find, to invent".  Lyric poets in Old French are called ''[[trouvères]]''.

By the late 13th century, the poetic tradition in France had begun to develop in ways that differed significantly from the troubadour poets, both in content and in the use of certain fixed forms. The new poetic (as well as musical: some of the earliest medieval music has lyrics composed in Old French by the earliest composers known by name) tendencies are apparent in the ''[[Roman de Fauvel]]'' in 1310 and 1314, a satire on abuses in the medieval church, filled with medieval [[motet]]s, [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]]s, [[Rondeau (music)|rondeaux]] and other new secular forms of poetry and music (mostly anonymous, but with several pieces by [[Philippe de Vitry]], who would coin the expression ''[[ars nova]]''  to distinguish the new musical practice from the music of the immediately preceding age).  The best-known poet and composer of ''ars nova'' secular music and chansons of the incipient [[Middle French]] period was [[Guillaume de Machaut]].

Discussions about the origins of non-religious theater (''théâtre profane'') – both drama and farce—in the Middle Ages remain controversial, but the idea of a continuous popular tradition stemming from Latin comedy and tragedy to the 9th century seems unlikely.
Most historians place the origin of medieval ''drama'' in the church's liturgical dialogues and "tropes".  [[Mystery play]]s were eventually transferred from the monastery church to the chapter house or refectory hall and finally to the open air, and the vernacular was substituted for Latin.  In the 12th century one finds the earliest extant passages in French appearing as refrains inserted into [[liturgical drama]]s in Latin, such as a [[Saint Nicholas]] (patron saint of the student clercs) play and a [[Saint Stephen]] play.
An early French dramatic play is ''[[Le Jeu d'Adam]]'' (c. 1150) written in octosyllabic rhymed couplets with Latin stage directions (implying that it was written by Latin-speaking clerics for a lay public).
   
A large body of [[fable]]s survive in Old French; these include (mostly anonymous) literature dealing with the recurring trickster character of [[Reynard]] the [[Fox]].  Marie de France was also active in this genre, producing the ''[[Ysopet]]'' (Little [[Aesop]]) series of fables in verse. Related to the fable was the more bawdy ''[[fabliau]]'', which covered topics such as cuckolding and corrupt clergy.  These ''fabliaux'' would be an important source for [[Chaucer]] and for the Renaissance short story (''conte'' or ''nouvelle'').

==Phonology==
{{See also|Phonological history of French}}
Old French was constantly changing and evolving.  However, the form in the late 12th century, as attested in a great deal of mostly poetic writings, can be considered standard.  The writing system at this time was more phonetic than that used in most subsequent centuries.  In particular, all written consonants (including final ones) were pronounced, except for ''s'' preceding non-[[stop consonant]]s and ''t'' in ''et'', and final ''e'' was pronounced {{IPAblink|ə}}.  The phonological system can be summarised as follows:&lt;ref&gt;The chart is based on phonologies given in Laborderie, Noëlle, ''Précis de Phonétique Historique'', Nathan 1994; and in Rickard, Peter, ''A History of the French Language'', 2nd edition, Routledge 1989, pp. 47-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notes:
*All [[obstruent]]s (plosives, fricatives and affricates) were subject to [[word-final devoicing]], which was usually indicated in the orthography.
*The [[affricate]]s {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/dz/}}, {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, {{IPA|/dʒ/}} became [[fricative]]s ({{IPA|[s]}}, {{IPA|[z]}}, {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, {{IPA|[ʒ]}}) in [[Middle French]].
**{{IPA|/ts/}} had three spellings &amp;ndash; ''c'' before ''e'' or ''i'', ''ç'' before other vowels, or ''z'' at the end of a word &amp;ndash; as seen in '''''c'''ent'', ''chan'''ç'''on'', ''pri'''z''''' ("a hundred, song, price").
**{{IPA|/dz/}} was written as ''z'', as in ''do'''z'''e'' "twelve", and did not occur word-initially.
*{{IPA|/ʎ/}} (''l [[mouillé]]''), as in ''conse'''il''''', ''trava'''ill'''ier'' ("advice, to work"), became {{IPA|/j/}} in [[French language|Modern French]].
*{{IPA|/ɲ/}} appeared not only in the middle of a word, but also at the end, as in ''poi'''ng''''' "fist". At the end of a word, {{IPA|/ɲ/}} was later lost, leaving a [[nasalized vowel]].
*{{IPA|/h/}} was found only in Germanic loanwords and was later lost (although it is [[transphonologization|transphonologized]] as the so-called [[aspirated h]] that blocks [[liaison (French)|liaison]]). In native Latin words, {{IPA|/h/}} was lost early on, as in ''om'', ''uem'', from Latin ''homō''.

At the end of words it was also devoiced to {{IPA|[θ]}}. In some texts it was sometimes written as ''dh'' or ''th'' (''aiudha, cadhuna, Ludher, vithe''). By 1100 it disappeared altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tables synoptiques de phonologie de l'ancien français|year=1908|publisher=Oxford Clarendon Press|url=https://archive.org/stream/tablessynoptique00bert#page/12/mode/1up|author=Berthon, H.

===Vowels===
In Old French, the nasal vowels were not separate phonemes but only [[allophone]]s of the oral vowels before a nasal consonant. The nasal consonant was fully pronounced; ''bon'' was pronounced {{IPA|[bõn]}} (Modern French {{IPA|[bɔ̃]}}). Nasal vowels were present even in [[open syllable]]s before nasals where Modern French has oral vowels, as in ''bone'' {{IPA|[bõnə]}} (Modern French ''bonne'' {{IPA|[bɔn]}}).

** {{IPA|/o/}} would later appear again when {{IPA|/aw/}} [[monophthongize]]d and also when {{IPA|/ɔ/}} closed in certain positions (such as when it was followed by original {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/z/}} but not by {{IPA|/ts/}}, which later became {{IPA|/s/}}).
** {{IPA|/õ/}} may have similarly been closed to {{IPA|/ũ/}}, in at least in some dialects, since it was borrowed into [[Middle English]] as {{IPA|/uːn/}} &gt; {{IPA|/aʊn/}} (Latin ''computāre'' &gt; OF ''conter'' &gt; English ''count''; Latin ''rotundum'' &gt; OF ''ront'' &gt; English ''round''; Latin ''bonitātem'' &gt; OF ''bonté'' &gt; English ''bounty''). In any case, traces of such a change were erased in later stages of French, when the close nasal vowels {{IPA|/ĩ ỹ õ~ũ/}} were opened to become {{IPA|/ɛ̃ œ̃ ɔ̃/}}.
* {{IPA|/ə̃/}} may have existed in the unstressed third-person plural verb ending ''-ent'', but it may have already passed to {{IPA|/ə/}}, which is known to have happened by the Middle French period at the latest.

Notes:
*In Early Old French (up to about the mid-12th century), the spelling {{angle bracket|ai}} represented a diphthong {{IPA|/aj/}} instead of the later [[monophthong]] {{IPA|/ɛ/}},&lt;ref&gt;Zink (1999), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; and {{angle bracket|ei}} represented the diphthong {{IPA|/ej/}}, which merged with {{IPA|/oj/}} in Late Old French (except when it was nasalized).
*In Early Old French, the diphthongs described above as "rising" may have been falling diphthongs ({{IPA|/ie̯/}}, {{IPA|/yj/}}, {{IPA|/ue̯/}}). In earlier works with vowel [[assonance]], the diphthong written {{angle bracket|ie}} did not assonate with any pure vowels, which suggests that it cannot have simply been {{IPA|/je/}}.
*The pronunciation of the vowels written {{angle bracket|ue}} and {{angle bracket|eu}} is debated. In the first records of Early Old French, they represented and were written as {{IPA|/uo/, /ou/}}, and by [[Middle French]], they had both merged as {{IPA|/ø ~ œ/}}, but the transitional pronunciations are unclear.
*Early Old French had additional triphthongs {{IPA|/iej/}} and {{IPA|/uoj/}} (equivalent to diphthongs followed by {{IPA|/j/}}); these soon merged into {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɥi/}} respectively.
*The diphthong {{angle bracket|iu}} was rare and had merged into {{angle bracket|ui}} by Middle French (OF ''tiule'' &gt; MF ''tuile'' 'tile'; OF ''siure'' &gt; Late OF ''suire'' &gt; MF ''suivre'' 'follow').

====Hiatus====
In addition to diphthongs, Old French had many instances of [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] between adjacent vowels because of the loss of an intervening consonant. Manuscripts generally do not distinguish hiatus from true diphthongs, but modern scholarly transcription indicates it with a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]], as in Modern French:
*Latin ''audīre'' &gt; OF ''oïr'' {{IPA|/oˈir/}} 'hear'
*Vulgar Latin *''vidūtum'' &gt; OF ''veü'' {{IPA|/vəˈy/}} 'seen'
*Latin ''rēgīnam'' &gt; OF ''reïne'' {{IPA|/rəˈinə/}} 'queen'
*Latin ''pāgēnsem'' &gt; OF ''païs'' {{IPA|/paˈis/}} 'country'
*Latin ''augustum'' &gt; OF ''aoust'' {{IPA|/aˈust/}} 'August'
*Latin ''patellam'' &gt; OF ''paele'' {{IPA|/paˈɛlə/}} 'pan'
*Late Latin ''quaternum'' &gt; OF ''quaïer'' {{IPA|/kwaˈjer/}} 'booklet, quire'
*Late Latin ''aetāticum'' &gt; OF ''aage'', ''eage'' {{IPA|/aˈad͡ʒə/ ~ /əˈad͡ʒə/}} 'age'

==Grammar==
===Nouns===
Old French maintained a two-case system, with a [[nominative case]] and an [[oblique case]], for longer than did some other Romance languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Case distinctions, at least in the masculine [[grammatical gender|gender]], were marked on both the [[definite article]] and the noun itself. Thus, the masculine noun ''li veisins'' "the neighbour" (Latin ''vicīnus'' {{IPA|/wɪˈkiːnʊs/}} &gt; Proto-Romance *''vecínos'' {{IPA|/veˈt͡sinos/}} &gt; OF ''veisins'' {{IPA|/vejˈzĩns/}}; Modern French ''le voisin'' {{IPA|/vwazɛ̃/}}) was declined as follows:

{|class="wikitable"

|-

|}

In later Old French, the distinctions had become moribund. As in most other Romance languages, it was the [[oblique case]] form that usually survived to become the Modern French form: ''l'enfant'' "the child" represents the old oblique (Latin accusative ''īnf'''ā'''ntem''); the Old French nominative was ''li enfes'' (Latin '''''ī'''nfāns''). There are some cases with significant differences between nominative and oblique forms (derived from Latin nouns with a stress shift between the nominative and other cases) in which either it is the nominative form that survives or both forms survive with different meanings:
*Both OFr ''li sire'', ''le sieur'' (Latin ''s'''e'''iior'', ''seii'''ō'''rem'') and ''le seignor'' (nom. &lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;''sendra'';&lt;ref&gt;The Old French nominative ''sendra'', inherited from Latin ''senior'', appears only in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] before it become obsolete.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin ''s'''e'''nior'', ''seni'''ō'''rem'') survive in the vocabulary of later French (''sire'', ''sieur'', ''seigneur'') as different ways to refer to a feudal [[lord]].
*Modern French ''[[wikt:sœur|sœur]]'' "sister" is the nominative form (Old French ''[[wikt:suer|suer]]'' &lt; Latin nominative ''s'''o'''ror''); the Old French oblique form ''seror'' (&lt; Latin accusative ''sor'''ō'''rem'') no longer survives.
*Modern French ''[[wikt:prêtre|prêtre]]'' "priest" is the nominative form (Old French ''[[wikt:prestre|prestre]]'' &lt; ''pr'''e'''sbyter''); the Old French oblique form ''[[wikt:prevoire|prevoire]]'', later ''[[wikt:provoire|provoire]]'' (&lt; ''presb'''y'''terem'') survives only in the Paris street name ''Rue des Prouvaires''.
*Modern French indefinite pronoun ''[[wikt:on|on]]'' "one" continues Old French nominative ''[[wikt:hom|hom]]'' "man" (&lt; ''h'''o'''mō''); ''[[wikt:homme|homme]]'' "man" continues the oblique form (OF ''[[wikt:home|home]]'' &lt; ''h'''o'''minem'').

In a few cases in which the only distinction between forms was the nominative ''-s'' ending, the ''-s'' was preserved in spelling to distinguish otherwise-homonymous words. An example is ''[[wikt:fils|fils]]'' "son" (&lt; Latin nominative ''f'''ī'''lius''), spelled to distinguish it from ''[[wikt:fil|fil]]'' "wire".  In this case, a later [[spelling pronunciation]] has resulted in the modern pronunciation {{IPA|/fis/}} (earlier {{IPA|/fi/}}).

As in Spanish and Italian, the neuter gender was eliminated, and most old neuter nouns became masculine. Some Latin neuter plurals were reanalysed as feminine singulars: Latin ''gaudium'' was more widely used in the plural form ''gaudia'', which was taken for a singular in Vulgar Latin and ultimately led to modern French ''la joie'', "joy" (feminine singular).

Nouns were declined in the following [[declension]]s:

|}

Class I is derived from the Latin [[first declension]]. Class Ia mostly comes from Latin feminine nouns in the [[third declension]]. Class II is derived from the Latin [[second declension]]. Class IIa generally stems from second-declension nouns ending in ''-er'' and from third-declension masculine nouns; in both cases, the Latin nominative singular did not end in ''-s'', which is preserved in Old French.

The classes show various analogical developments: ''-es'' from the accusative instead of ''-∅'' (''-e'' after a consonant cluster) in Class I nominative plural (Latin ''-ae''), ''li pere'' instead of ''*li peres'' (Latin ''illi patres'') in Class IIa nominative plural, modelled on Class II, etc.

Class III nouns show a separate form in the nominative singular that does not occur in any of the other forms. IIIa nouns ended in ''-'''ā'''tor'', ''-āt'''ō'''rem'' in Latin and preserve the stress shift; IIIb nouns also had a stress shift, from ''-ō'' to ''-'''ō'''nem''. IIIc nouns are an Old French creation and have no clear Latin antecedent. IIId nouns represent various other types of third-declension Latin nouns with stress shift or a change of consonant (''s'''o'''ror'', ''sor'''ō'''rem; '''ī'''nfāns, īnf'''ā'''ntem; pr'''e'''sbyter, presb'''y'''terem; s'''e'''iior, seii'''ō'''rem; c'''o'''mes, c'''o'''mitem).

Regular feminine forms of masculine nouns are formed by adding an ''-e'' to the masculine stem unless the masculine stem already ends in ''-e''. For example, ''[[wikt:bergier|bergier]]'' (shepherd) becomes ''[[wikt:bergiere|bergiere]]'' (Modern French ''[[wikt:berger|berger]]'' and ''[[wikt:bergère|bergère]]'').

===Adjectives===
Adjectives agree in terms of [[Grammatical number|number]], gender and case with the noun that they are qualifying. Thus, a feminine plural noun in the nominative case requires any qualifying adjectives to be feminine, plural and nominative. For example, in ''femes riches'', ''[[wikt:riche#Old French|riche]]'' has to be in the feminine plural form.

Adjectives can be divided into three declensional classes:&lt;ref&gt;Moignet (1988, p. 26–31), Zink (1992, p. 39–48), de La Chaussée (1977, p. 39–44)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Class I corresponding roughly to [[Latin declension#First and second declension adjectives|Latin 1st- and 2nd-declension adjectives]]
*Class II corresponding roughly to [[Latin declension#Third declension adjectives|Latin 3rd-declension adjectives]]
*Class III containing primarily the descendants of [[Latin declension#Comparative and superlative forms of adjectives|Latin synthetic comparative forms]] in ''-ior'', ''-iōrem''.

Class I adjectives have a feminine singular form (nominative and oblique) ending in ''-e''. They can be further subdivided into two subclasses, based on the masculine nominative singular form. Class Ia adjectives have a masculine nominative singular ending in ''-s'':
:''[[wikt:bon#Old French|bon]]'' "good" (&lt; Latin ''[[wikt:bonus#Latin|bonus]]'', &gt; modern French ''[[wikt:bon#French|bon]]'')
:{| class="wikitable"

| ''bons'' || ''bon'' 
| rowspan="2" | ''bone'' || rowspan="2" | ''bones'' 
| ''bon''
|-
! Oblique
| ''bon'' || ''bons'' || —
|}

For Class Ib adjectives, the masculine nominative singular ends in ''-e'', like the feminine. There are descendants of Latin second- and third-declension adjectives ending in ''-er'' in the nominative singular:
:''aspre'' "harsh" (&lt; Latin ''[[wikt:asper#Latin|asper]]'', &gt; modern French ''[[wikt:âpre#French|âpre]]'')
:{| class="wikitable"

| ''aspre'' 
| rowspan="2" | ''aspre'' || rowspan="2" | ''aspres'' 
| ''aspre''
|-
! Oblique
| ''aspres'' || —
|}

For Class II adjectives, the feminine singular is not marked by the ending ''-e'':
:''[[wikt:granz#Old French|granz]]'' "big, great" (&lt; Latin ''[[wikt:grandis#Latin|grandis]]'', &gt; modern French ''[[wikt:grand#French|grand]]'')
:{| class="wikitable"

| ''granz''/''grant'' || rowspan="2" | ''granz'' 
| ''grant''
|-
! Oblique
| ''grant'' || ''granz'' || ''grant'' || —
|}
An important subgroup of Class II adjectives is the present participial forms in ''-ant''.

Class III adjectives have a stem alternation, resulting from stress shift in the Latin third declension and a distinct neuter form: 
:''[[wikt:meillor#Old French|mieudre]]'' "better" (&lt; Latin ''[[wikt:melior#Latin|melior]]'', &gt; modern French ''[[wikt:meilleur#French|meilleur]]'')
:{| class="wikitable"

| ''mieudre'' || rowspan="2" | ''meillors'' 
| ''mieuz''
|-
! Oblique
| ''meillor'' || ''meillors'' || ''meillor'' || —
|}

In later Old French, Classes II and III tended to be moved across to Class I, which was complete by Middle French. Modern French thus has only a single adjective declension, unlike most other Romance languages, which have two or more.

===Verbs===
Verbs in Old French show the same extreme phonological deformations as other Old French words.  Morphologically, however, Old French verbs are extremely conservative in preserving intact most of the Latin alternations and irregularities that had been inherited in [[Proto-Romance]]. Old French has much less analogical reformation than Modern French has and significantly less than the oldest stages of other languages (such as [[Old Spanish]]) despite the fact that the various [[phonological development]]s in Gallo-Romance and Proto-French led to complex alternations in the majority of commonly-used verbs.

For example, the Old French verb ''laver'' "to wash" (Latin ''lav'''ā'''re'') is conjugated ''je lef'', ''tu leves'', ''il leve'' in the [[present indicative]] and ''je lef'', ''tu les'', ''il let'' in the [[present subjunctive]], in both cases regular phonological developments from Latin indicative ''l'''a'''vō'', ''l'''a'''vās'', ''l'''a'''vat'' and subjunctive ''l'''a'''vem'', ''l'''a'''vēs'', ''l'''a'''vet''. The following paradigm is typical in showing the phonologically regular but morphologically irregular alternations of most paradigms:
*The alternation ''je lef'' ~ ''tu leves'' is a regular result of the final [[devoicing]] triggered by loss of final /o/ but not /a/.
*The alternation ''laver'' ~ ''tu leves'' is a regular result of the diphthongization of a stressed [[open syllable]] /a/ into /ae/ &gt; {{IPA|/æ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/e/}}.
*The alternation ''je lef'' ~ ''tu les'' ~ ''il let'' in the subjunctive is a regular result of the simplification of the final clusters /fs/ and /ft/, resulting from loss of /e/ in final syllables.
Modern French, on the other hand, has ''je lave'', ''tu laves'', ''il lave'' in both indicative and subjunctive, reflecting significant analogical developments: analogical borrowing of unstressed vowel /a/, analogical ''-e'' in the first singular (from verbs like ''j'entre'', with a regular ''-e'' ) and wholesale replacement of the subjunctive with forms modelled on ''-ir''/''-oir''/''-re'' verbs. All serve to eliminate the various alternations in the Old French verb paradigm. Even modern "irregular" verbs are not immune from analogy: For example, Old French ''je vif'', ''tu vis'', ''il vit'' (''vivre'' "to live") has yielded to modern ''je vis'', ''tu vis'', ''il vit'', eliminating the unpredictable ''-f'' in the first-person singular.

The [[simple past]] also shows extensive analogical reformation and simplification in Modern French, as compared with Old French.

The Latin [[pluperfect]] was preserved in very early Old French as a past tense with a value similar to a [[preterite]] or [[imperfect]]. For example, the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia]] (878 AD) has past-tense forms such as ''avret'' (&lt; Latin ''habuerat''), ''voldret'' (&lt; Latin ''voluerat''), alternating with past-tense forms from the Latin perfect (continued as the modern "simple past"). [[Old Occitan]] also preserved this tense, with a [[conditional mood|conditional]] value; [[Spanish language|Spanish]] still preserves this tense (the ''-ra'' imperfect subjunctive), as does [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (in its original value as a pluperfect indicative).

====Verb alternations====
In Latin, stress was determined automatically by the number of syllables in a word and the [[syllable weight|weight]] (length) of the syllables. That resulted in certain automatic stress shifts between related forms in a paradigm, depending on the nature of the suffixes added. For example, in ''p'''e'''nsō'' "I think", the first syllable was stressed, but in ''pens'''ā'''mus'' "we think", the second syllable was stressed. In many Romance languages, vowels diphthongized in stressed syllables under certain circumstances but not in unstressed syllables, resulting in alternations in verb paradigms: [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''pienso'' "I think" vs. ''pensamos'' "we think" (''pensar'' "to think"), or ''cuento'' "I tell" vs. ''contamos'' "we tell" (''contar'' "to tell").

In the development of French, at least five vowels diphthongized in stressed, [[open syllable]]s. Combined with other stress-dependent developments, that yielded 15 or so types of alternations in so-called [[Irregular verb|strong verbs]] in Old French. For example, {{IPA|/a/}} diphthongized to {{IPA|/ai/}} before [[nasal stop]]s in stressed, open syllables but not in unstressed syllables, yielding ''aim'' "I love" (Latin '''''a'''mō'') but ''amons'' "we love" (Latin ''am'''ā'''mus'').

In Modern French, the verbs in the ''-er'' class have been systematically levelled. Generally, the "weak" (unstressed) form predominates, but there are some exceptions (such as modern ''aimer''/''nous aimons''). The only remaining alternations are in verbs like ''acheter''/''j'achète'' and ''jeter''/''je jette'', with unstressed {{IPA|/ə/}} alternating with stressed {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and in (largely-learned) verbs like ''adhérer/j'adhère'', with unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} alternating with stressed {{IPA|/ɛ/}}. Many of the non-''er'' verbs have become obsolete, and many of the remaining verbs have been levelled. A few alternations remain, however, in what are now known as [[irregular verbs]], such as ''je tiens'', ''nous tenons''; ''je dois'', ''nous devons'' and ''je meurs'', ''nous mourons''.

Some verbs had a more irregular alternation between different-length stems, with a longer, stressed stem alternating with a shorter, unstressed stem. That was a regular development stemming from the loss of unstressed [[Romance languages#Intertonic vowels|intertonic vowels]], which remained when they were stressed:
*''j'aiu''/''aidier'' "help" &lt; ''adi'''ū'''tō'', ''adiūt'''ā'''re''
*''j'araison''/''araisnier'' "speak to" &lt; ''adrati'''ō'''nō'', ''adratiōn'''ā'''re''
*''je deraison''/''deraisnier'' "argue" &lt; ''dērati'''ō'''nō'', ''dēratiōn'''ā'''re''
*''je desjun''/''disner'' "dine" &lt; ''disiēi'''ū'''nō'', ''disiēiūn'''ā'''re''
*''je manju''/''mangier'' "eat" &lt; ''mand'''ū'''cō'', ''mandūc'''ā'''re''
*''je parol''/''parler'' "speak" &lt; ''*par'''au'''lō'', ''*paraul'''ā'''re'' &lt; ''parabolō'', ''parabolāre''

The alternation of ''je desjun'', ''disner'' is particularly complicated; it appears that ''disiēiūnāre'' &gt; [[Western Romance]] {{IPA|/desjejuˈnare}} &gt; {{IPA|/desjejˈnare/}} (preliminary intertonic loss) &gt; {{IPA|/desiˈnare/}} ([[triphthong]] reduction) &gt; {{IPA|/disiˈnare/}} ([[metaphony (Romance languages)|metaphony]]) &gt; {{IPA|/disˈner/}} (further intertonic loss and other proto-French developments). Both stems have become full verbs in Modern French: ''déjeuner'' "to have lunch" and ''dîner'' "to dine".  Furthermore, ''déjeuner'' does not derive directly from ''je desjun'' (&lt; ''*disi(ēi)ūnō'', with total loss of unstressed ''-ēi-''). Instead, it comes from Old French ''desjeüner'', based on the alternative form ''je desjeün'' (&lt; ''*disiē(i)ūnō'', with loss of only ''-i-'', likely influenced by ''jeûner'' "to fast" &lt; Old French ''jeüner'' &lt; ''je jeün'' {{IPA|/d͡ʒe.ˈyn/}} "I fast" &lt; ''iē(i)ūnō'': ''iē-'' is an initial rather than intertonic so the vowel ''-ē-'' does not disappear).

The '''Forum of Corporations''', or the '''Piazzale delle Corporazioni''', was the principal center of commerce and trade for the [[Roman Empire]] mainly during the Age of [[Augustus]]. Located in the major port city of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], this open-air market was essential for Rome as a place of varying and exotic goods from foreign lands. Merchants gathered here to sell anything from grain and shipping services to elephants and giraffes.

Rebuilt in the 2nd century AD, The Forum of Corporations was also representative of the many diverse cultures that made up the Roman Empire. Oil importers, grain importers, rope-makers, and ship builders from corporations spanning across the empire came here to benefit from Ostia’s positioning at the mouth of the [[Tiber River]] which easily facilitated the importation and transportation of goods into the empire.

== Structure ==
The forum was enclosed by a wall made of brick surfaced with stucco and measured 100  meters by 80 meters. A total of 61 rooms, each which was 4 meters by 4 meters, opened up to the forum. The rooms were separated by a wooden partition and were arranged based on geographical origin of the merchant or business, the majority which were based in Africa.

There is also a temple in the middle of the forum to Annona Augusta, the Divinity of Imperial Supplies, or Ceres Augusta. This temple served as a guild temple and reflects the role of religion in all aspect of Roman life, including business.

[[File:Mosaic Elephant.jpg|thumb|200px|An example of the mosaics found in the Forum of Corporations]]

The most notable detail of the Forum of Corporations are the intricate black and white mosaics that lie in front of each shop. These mosaics indicated the professional associations of each vendor as well as inspired a sense of nostalgia for the distant homes of each of the merchants. The forum was adjacent to the theater of Ostia and people would also pass through the forum before and after performances.

== Center for Guilds ==
The Piazzale dell Corporazioni was often the home of the offices for approximately 40 guilds. These guilds were religious associations that dealt mainly with grain trade and navigation through Ostia, which served as the main food supply source for Rome. There were six divisions of guilds: Grain Shipping and Related Services, Commerce, Transport, Trades, Civil Service, Cults (Hermansen). The guilds represented a bridge between international and domestic relations through trading, worship and banquets.

[[File:Scheme of FOC.jpg|thumb|Basic outline of the structure of the Forum]]

Many guilds used the temple in the center of the Forum of Corporations as a meeting place where they would worship, and hold banquets and assemblies. The various perennial religious ceremonies that they celebrated were performed at the temple.

[[File:caledonian-pict.jpg|thumb|right|A Caledonian or Pict, as represented in a 19th-century history book]]

* Pulp fiction author [[Robert E. Howard]] wrote extensively about his romanticized version of the Picts, especially in his short stories revolving around the fictional character [[Bran Mak Morn]], but also in many other of his stories.  In his [[Conan the Barbarian]] series, the Picts are described as very similar in culture to the [[indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands]], especially the [[Iroquois]] or [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]].
* [[Rudyard Kipling]] devotes several chapters to the Picts in his book ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]''.
* Historical fantasy author [[Juliet Marillier]]'s series ''[[The Bridei Chronicles]]'' tells of the Picts and [[Gaels]] in the sixth century A.D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.julietmarillier.com/books/brideihistoricalnotes.html The Official Site | Bridei Series]. Juliet Marillier. Retrieved on 2014-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nancy Farmer (author)|Nancy Farmer]]'s series ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' depicts fictional Picts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nancyfarmerwebsite.com/trolls-trilogy.html Trolls Trilogy - Nancy Farmer's official home page]. Nancyfarmerwebsite.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his poem "An Irish Monk on Lindisfarne", [[Gael Turnbull]] wrote,&lt;ref name=turnbull1&gt;{{cite book |last=Turnbull |first=Gael |chapter= An Irish Monk on Lindisfarne |title= While Breath Persist |page=12ff |isbn=0-88984-133-0 |year=1992 |publisher= The Porcupine's Quill, Inc. |location=Erin, Ontario }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turnbull2&gt;Turnbull, Gael.

{{quote|On the road coming, five days' travel, a Pict woman&lt;br&gt;(big mouth and small bones) gave me shelter, and&lt;br&gt;laughed (part scorn, part pity) at my journey.}}
* [[Anne Rice]] also wrote of fictional Picts, crafting them into the [[Táltos|Taltos]] for her book series ''[[The Lives of the Mayfair Witches]]''.
* [[Karen Marie Moning]] also wrote about the Picts for her third novel of the [[Karen Marie Moning#Highlander Series|Highlander Series]] ''The Highlander's Touch''.
* Another use of the Picts in a fantasy setting comes in [[Jacqueline Carey]]'s [[Kushiel's Legacy]] fantasy series concerning the Kingdom of Alba and the Picts, and their dealings with Terre D'Ange.
* [[Matthew Stover]]'s [[Bronze Age]] fantasy novels ''[[Iron Dawn (novel)|Iron Dawn]]'' and ''[[Jericho Moon]]'' chronicle the adventures of Barra Coll Eigg Rhum, a Pictish princess.
* The 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan The Barbarian]]'' features bodybuilder [[Franco Columbu]] in a cameo as a blue-tattooed Pictish scout.
* The 2004 film ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'' depicts Celts and Picts (called "Woads" in the film) as tattooed and painted savage forest people, led by the dark magician [[Merlin]]. Originally enemies to [[King Arthur|Arthur]] and his knights, they later unite to defeat the Saxons at [[Badon Hill]].
* [[Neil Marshall]]'s 2010 film ''[[Centurion (film)|Centurion]]'' features a conflict between a band of Picts and the [[Legio IX Hispana|Roman Ninth Legion]].
* In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s [[Discworld]] novels, particularly those featuring the Lancre witches, the Picts are an obvious influence on the [[Nac Mac Feegle]], a race of tiny wood-fairies whose speech is influenced by Scottish Gaelic and who are tattooed with blue war-paint. In ''[[Carpe Jugulum]]'', they are called "Pictsies."
* [[Arthur Ransome]], celebrated author of the classic [[Swallows and Amazons]] series of books, titled the eleventh book of the series "[[The Picts and the Martyrs]]". Published in 1943, it features the adventures of a group of children holidaying in the [[Lake District]].  In the book, two of the children are unexpectedly forced to live secretly in a ruined house in the woods, and they become "Picts". Another two must endure the unwanted presence of their Great Aunt, thus becoming "Martyrs". A general description of historical Picts is given by one of the children when they first take that name, and a somewhat more detailed explanation is given later by a parent in a letter.
* Jack Dixon's ''The Pict'',&lt;ref name=Freiert&gt;{{cite book|last=Freiert|first=Jeff|title=Best New Writing 2008|year=2008|publisher=Hopewell Publications|isbn=9781933435268|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; historical fiction, is told from the point of view of the 1st century Picts who resisted invasion by two Roman legions, the Ninth and the Twentieth, led by [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] in 83 C.E. The main character (Calach) is the Caledonian leader ([[Calgacus]]) who united the twenty Pictish tribes against the Roman invasion. The antagonist (Agricola) is sent by the emperor to conquer the whole of the British Isles or not return to Rome. The story offers an alternative to [[Tacitus]]'s account of the battle of [[Mons Graupius]], and it credits the unified Pictish resistance with a pivotal role in the development of the Scottish nation.
* British rock band [[Pink Floyd]] performed a song on their 1969 ''[[Ummagumma]]'' album entitled "[[Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict]]."
* In the 2011 film ''[[The Eagle (2011 film)|The Eagle]]'', directed by Kevin Macdonald, and starring Channing Tatum, Jamie Bell and Donald Sutherland. Adapted by Jeremy Brock from Rosemary Sutcliff's historical adventure novel ''[[The Eagle of the Ninth]]'' (1954), the film tells the story of a young Roman officer searching to recover the lost Roman eagle standard of his father's legion in the northern part of Great Britain. The story is based on the Ninth Spanish Legion's supposed disappearance in Britain. Aquila decides to recover it. Despite the warnings of his uncle and his fellow Romans, who believe that no Roman can survive north of Hadrian's Wall, he travels north into the territory of the "Picts", accompanied only by his slave, Esca.
* In the 2012 game ''[[Civilization V: Gods &amp; Kings]]'', the Pictish Warrior is the unique unit of the Celtic civilization.
* In the 2013 volume ''[[Asterix and the Picts]]'', Asterix and Obelix meet the Picts.
* The Charlemagne downloadable content was released for the 2012 game ''[[Crusader Kings II]]''. The Picts are an existing culture, but may later become Scottish.
* In the 2015 game ''[[Total War: Attila]]'' the Picts are a playable faction in the Celts DLC Culture Pack.
* The 2017 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode ''[[The Eaters of Light]]'' is set in Scotland at the time of the Picts' wars with the Romans.
* In the 2017 video game [[Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice]], the player character is a Pictish woman.
* The 2018 strategy game ''[[Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia]]'' features the Pictish kingdom of [[Circenn]] as a playable faction.

==Fairies and Picts==
[[David MacRitchie]] was an outspoken proponent of the [[euhemerism|euhemeristic]] origin of [[fairy|fairies]] being the folk memory of Picts.&lt;ref&gt;Macculloch, 1932: "The origin of fairies in a small race of men [though it should be remembered that all fairies are not small] was strongly advocated in more recent times by Mr. David MacRitchie."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 1986; 1998: 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued they were rooted in a real diminutive or pygmy-statured indigenous population that lived during the late [[Neolithic Britain|Stone Age]] across the British Isles, especially Scotland:

{{Quote|"Postulations based on the premise that fairies constitute a folk memory of former races, conquered peoples who were pushed out beyond the periphery of settled areas, have fuelled the imagination of many scholars on this subject. Of particular significance was a theory advanced by [[David MacRitchie]] that fairies were an actual race of small or 'little' people, the original Pict[ish] peoples of Scotland."&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Cowan, 2001: 20f.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

MacRitchie developed what became known as the "Pygmy-Pict theory" in his ''The Testimony of Tradition'' (1890) and ''Fians, Fairies and Picts'' (1893) regarding fairies to have been folk memories of the aboriginal Picts who in his view were of very small size, pointing to findings of short doors (3 – 4&amp;nbsp;ft in height) of chambers, underground dwellings, [[long barrows]], as well as quoting old literature such as [[Adam of Bremen]]'s ''[[Historia Norwegiæ]]'' which describe the Picts of [[Orkney]] as "only a little exceeding pygmies in stature". The folklorist [[John Francis Campbell]], who MacRitchie cited, had also written in his ''[[Popular Tales of the West Highlands]]'' (1860–62):

{{Quote|"I believe there once was a small race of people in these islands, who are remembered as fairies [...] the fairy was probably a Pict."&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Cowan, 2001: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Robert Louis Stevenson]] described so the Picts in his Heather Ale poem:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Rudely plucked from their hiding,''
   ''Never a word they spoke:''
''A son and his aged father—''
   ''Last of the dwarfish folk.''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Modern archaeological studies demonstrate that the Picts were not significantly different in height to present-day occupants of Scotland.

The '''Chair in Medieval and Renaissance English''' is a [[List of Professorships at the University of Cambridge|professorship]] in [[English literature|English]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. It was created in 1954 for [[C. S. Lewis]], and is unusual among professorships in this field in uniting 'medieval' and 'renaissance' categories and fields of study.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24208">'''Public participation''' ('''citizen participation''') is a political principle or practice, and may also be recognised as a right. The terms public participation, often called P2 by practitioners, is sometimes used interchangeably with the concept or practice of [[stakeholder engagement]] and/or popular participation.

Generally public participation seeks and facilitates the involvement of those potentially affected by or interested in a decision. This can be in relation to individuals, governments, institutions, companies or any other entities that affect public interests.  The principle of public participation holds that those who are affected by a decision have a right to be involved in the decision-making process. Public participation implies that the public's contribution will influence the decision.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iap2.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=4 |title=IAP2 Core Values for the Practice of Public Participation |publisher=Iap2.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co-intelligence.org/CIPol_publicparticipation.html |title=Principles of Public Participation |publisher=Co-intelligence.org |date=2008-05-23 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public participation may be regarded as a way of [[empowerment]] and as vital part of democratic governance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In the context of [[knowledge management]] the establishment of ongoing '''participatory processes''' is seen by some in the facilitator of [[collective intelligence]] and inclusiveness, shaped by the desire for the participation of the whole community or society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Public participation is part of "people centred" or "human centric" principles, which have emerged in [[Western world|Western]] culture over the last thirty
years, and has had some bearings of [[education]], [[business]], [[public policy]] and international relief and development programs. Public participation is advanced by the [[humanism|humanist]] movements. Public participation may be advanced as part of a "people first" paradigm shift. In this respect public participation may challenge the concept that "big is better" and the logic of centralized
hierarchies, advancing alternative concepts of "more heads are better than one" and arguing that public participation can sustain productive and durable change.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/pubs/ptdv1000.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711143102/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/pubs/ptdv1000.pdf |date=July 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of public participation in economic and human development was enshrined in the 1990 [[African Charter for Popular Participation in Development and Transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africaaction.org/african-initiatives/chartall.htm African Charter for Popular Participation in Development and Transformation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502170947/http://www.africaaction.org/african-initiatives/chartall.htm |date=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 practitioners established the International Association for Public Practitioners in order to respond to the increasing interest in the practice, and in turn established the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Association for Public Participation|url = http://www.iap2.org/|website = www.iap2.org|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is well established globally and the International Association of Public Participation now has affiliate organizations across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Association for Public Participation - Affiliates|url = http://www.iap2.org/?page=Affiliates|website = www.iap2.org|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Budgeting ===
{{Main|Participatory budgeting}}

Participatory budgeting is a process of democratic deliberation and decision-making, in which ordinary city residents decide how to allocate part of a municipal or public budget. Participatory budgeting is usually characterized by several basic design features: identification of spending priorities by community members, election of budget delegates to represent different communities, facilitation and technical assistance by public employees, local and higher level assemblies to deliberate and vote on spending priorities, and the implementation of local direct-impact community projects.
Participatory budgeting may be used by towns and cities around the world, and has been widely publicised in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]], were the first full participatory budgeting process was developed starting in 1989.

=== Development ===
{{Main|Participatory development|Participatory planning|Participatory rural appraisal}}

In economic development theory, there is a school of [[participatory development]]. The desire to increase public participation in humanitarian aid and development has led to the establishment of a numerous context-specific, formal methodologies, matrices, pedagogies and ad hoc approaches. These include conscientization and praxis; [[Participatory action research]] (PAR), [[Participatory rural appraisal|rapid rural appraisal]] (RRA) and participatory rural appraisal (PRA); [[appreciation influence control analysis]] (AIC); "open space" approaches; [[Objectives Oriented Project Planning]] (ZOPP); [[vulnerability analysis]] and [[capacity analysis]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

=== Media ===

=== Public policy ===
{{See also|Participatory democracy}}

In some countries public participation has become a central principle of [[public policy]] making. In the UK it has been observed that all levels of [[government]] have started to build [[citizen]] and [[stakeholder engagement]] into their policy-making processes. This may involve large-scale [[Public consultation|consultation]]s, [[focus group]] research, online discussion forums, or deliberative citizens' juries. There are many different public participation mechanisms, although these often share common features (for a list over 100, and a typology of mechanisms, see Rowe and Frewer, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, G. and Frewer, L.J. (2005) A typology of public engagement mechanisms, Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, 30 (2), 251-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public participation is viewed as a tool, intended to inform planning, organising or funding of activities. Public participation may also be used to measure attainable objectives, evaluate impact, and identify lessons for future practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.involve.org.uk/evaluation/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927001316/http://www.involve.org.uk/evaluation/ |date=September 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States public participation in administrative rulemaking refers to the process by which proposed rules are subject to public comment for a specified period of time. Public participation is typically mandatory for rules promulgated by executive agencies of the US government.  Statutes or agency policies may mandate [[public hearing]]s during this period.&lt;ref name="Ali Assari"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Assari|first=Ali|author2=T.M.

== Public trust ==
In recent years loss of [[public trust]] in authorities and politicians  has become a widespread concern in many democratic societies. Public participation is a regarded as one potential solution to the crisis in public trust and governance, particularly in the UK, Europe, and other democracies. The idea is that public should be involved more fully in the policy process in that authorities seek public views and participation, instead of treating the public as simply passive recipients of policy decisions.

The underlying assumption by political theorists, social commentators, and even politicians is that public participation increase public trust in authorities, improving citizen political efficacy, enhancing democratic ideals and even improving the quality of policy decisions. However, the assumed benefits of public participation in restoring public trust are yet to be confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, G. and Frewer, L.J. (2000) Public participation methods: A framework for evaluation, Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, 25 (1), 3-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, G. and Gammack, J.G. (2004) Promise and perils of electronic public engagement, Science and Public Policy, 31 (1), 39-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifr.ac.uk/Science/Partnership/RCS/public_perception.html |title=Public participation (science in society) |publisher=Ifr.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accountability and transparency==
{{main|Radical transparency}}
Public participation may also be viewed as accountability enhancing. The argument being that public participation can be a means for the participating communities to hold public authorities accountable for implementation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Nazrul Islam, Nazrul Isable Martinez and Wang Xi, "Environmental Law in Developing Countries: Selected Issues, IUCN, 2002, pg.7&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom citizens are used to ensure the fair and humane detention of prisoners. Volunteers comprise the [[Independent Monitoring Board]] that reports on the fair and humane detention of prisoners and detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roffee|first=James A.|date=2017-01-01|title=Accountability and Oversight of State Functions: Use of Volunteers to Monitor Equality and Diversity in Prisons in England and Wales|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2158244017690792|journal=SAGE Open|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2158244017690792|doi=10.1177/2158244017690792|issn=2158-2440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environment and sustainable development ==
In recent years public participation has become to be seen as a vital part of addressing environmental problems and bringing about [[sustainable development]]. In this context the limits of solely relying on technocratic bureaucratic monopoly of decision making, and it is argued that public participation allows governments to adopt policies and enact laws that are relevant to communities and take into account their needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Public participation is recognised as an environmental principle, see [[Environmental Principles and Policies]], and has been enshrined in the [[Rio Declaration]].

=== Public participation in environmental governance ===
With growing complexities of the environmental issues, public participation has come to the fore in academic analysis concerning the contemporary debates about [[environmental governance]].

There have emerged a number of arguments in favour of a more participatory approach, which stress that public participation is a crucial element in environmental governance that contributes to better [[Decision-making|decision making]]. It is recognised that environmental problems cannot be solved by government alone.&lt;ref&gt;Pring, G. and Noé, S.Y. (2002) 'The Emerging International Law of Public Participation Affecting Global Mining, Energy, and Resource Development' in Zillman, D.M., Lucas, A. and Pring, G.(eds) ''Human Rights in Natural Resource Development: Public Participation in the Sustainable Development of Mining and Energy Resources'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, P 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in environmental decision-making effectively links the public to environmental governance. By involving the public, who are at the root of both causes and solutions of environmental problems, in environmental discussions, transparency and accountability are more likely to be achieved, thus secures the democratic legitimacy of decision-making that good environmental governance depends on.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Bulkeley, H. and Mol, A.P.J. (2003), 'Participation and Environmental Governance: Consensus, Ambivalence and Debate', ''Environmental Values'' '''12''' (2): 143–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/opinion/view/20080721-149784/Public-participation-in-Environmental-Governance |title=Ramos, G. Public participation in Environmental Governance |publisher=Globalnation.inquirer.net |date=2008-07-21 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, a strong public participation in environmental governance could increase the commitment among stockholders, which strengthens the compliance and enforcement of environmental laws. GIS can provide a valuable tool for such work (see [[GIS and environmental governance]]). In addition, some opponents argue that the right to participate in environmental decision-making is a procedural right that "can be seen as part of the fundamental right to environmental protection".&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Du Plessis, A. (2008), 'Public Participation, Good Environmental Governance and Fulfillment of Environmental Rights', ''Potchefstroom Electronic Law Journal'', '''11'''(2): 170-201.(4)&lt;/ref&gt; From this ethical perspective, environmental governance is expected to operate within a framework coinciding the "constitutional principle of fairness (inclusive of equality)", which inevitably requires the fulfillment of "environmental rights" and ultimately calls for the engagement of public.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; Further, in the context of considerable scientific uncertainties surrounding environmental issues, public participation helps to counter such uncertainties and bridges the gap between scientifically-defined environmental problems and the experiences and values of stakeholders.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, F. (2000) ''Citizens, Experts and the Environment'', Durham, NC: Duke University Press, p.222.&lt;/ref&gt; Through joint effort of the government and scientists in collaboration with the public, better governance of environment is expected to be achieved by making the most appropriate decision possible.

Although broad agreements exist, the notion of public participation in environmental decision-making has been subject to a sustained critique concerning the real outcome of participatory environmental governance. Critics argue that public participation tends to focus on reaching a consensus between actors who share the same values and seek the same outcomes. However, the uncertain nature of many of the environmental issues would undermine the validity of public participation, given that in many cases the actors come to the table of discussion hold very different perceptions of the problem and solution which are unlikely to be welded into a consensus due to the incommensurability of different positions.&lt;ref&gt;Pellizzoni, L. (2003): 'Uncertainty and Participatory Democracy', ''Environmental Values'' '''12'''(2): 195-224.&lt;/ref&gt; This may run the risk of expert bias, which generates further exclusion as those who are antagonistic to the consensus would be marginalised in the environmental decision-making process, which violates the assumed advantage of participatory approach to produce democratic environmental decisions. This raises the further question of whether consensus should be the measure of a successful outcome of participation.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, S. (2000). 'Engaging the public: information and deliberation in environmental policy', ''Environment and Planning A'', 32: 1141–8.&lt;/ref&gt; As Davies suggests, participative democracy could not guarantee the substantive environmental benefits 'if there are competing views of what the environment should be like and what it is valuable for'.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, A. (2001). 'What silence knows – planning, public participation and environmental values', ''Environmental Values'', 10: 77–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, who should be involved at what points in the process of environmental decision-making and what is the goal of this kind of participation become central to the debates on public participation as a key issue in environmental governance.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

=== Citizen science ===
{{Main|Citizen science}}

Citizen science is a coined term commonly used to describe the participation of non-scientists in scientific research.

Liz Richardson, a Visiting Fellow in the Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion (CASE) at the London School of Economics and an editor for the journal Local Government Studies, has long advocated for the greater inclusion of non-professional scientists in policy research. She emphasizes that it is academia's responsibly to facilitate the "democratization of policy research" noting several benefits of having citizens involved in not just the contribution of data, but also the framing and development of research itself (2014). She notes that the biggest disadvantage of citizen science is the reliance on using citizens as only contributing members of the scientific endeavors and pushes for a more community-based participatory research method which would include laypeople in the entirety of the research process while emphasizing the scientific method popularized by citizen science.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Liz. "Engaging the Public in Policy Research: Are Community Researchers the Answer?" Politics and Governance, vol. 2, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2017 article, Colin Chapman and Crona Hodges outline what they believe to be the key to success in applying citizen science to policy development: data which is "suitable, robust, and of a known quality for evidence-based policy making" (2017). They identified several barriers to applying citizen science to policy development including a lack of suitability between the data collected and the policy in question and skepticism regarding the data collected by non-experts.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Colin and Crona Hodges. "Can Citizen Science Seriously Contribute to Policy Development?: A Decision Maker's View." Analyzing the Role of Citizen Science in Modern Research. IGI Global, 2017. 246-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Right to public participation ==
In some jurisdictions the right to public participation is enshrined by law. The right to public participation may also be conceived of as [[human right]], or as manifestation of the right to [[freedom of association]] and [[freedom of assembly]]. As such the [[Netherlands]], Germany, Denmark and Sweden, have public participation and [[freedom of information]] provisions in their legal systems since before the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encora.eu/coastalwiki/Public_participation_legislation |title=Public participation legislation - Coastal Wiki |publisher=Encora.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Democracy]] and public participation are closely connected democratic societies have incorporated public participation rights into their laws for centuries. For example, in the US the right to petition has been part of the first Amendment of the [[US constitution]] since 1791.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; More recently, since the 1970s in New Zealand numerous laws (e.g.: health, local government, environmental management) require government officials to "consult" those affected by a matter and take their views into consideration when making decisions.

Effective public participation depends on the public having accessing to accurate and comprehensive information. Hence laws regarding public participation often deal with the issue of the [[right to know]], access of information and [[freedom of information]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The right to participation may also be advanced in the context of [[Equality of opportunity|equality]] and [[group rights]], meant to ensure equal and full participation of a designated group in society. For example, in the context of disabled people.

===Rio Declaration on Environment and Development===
{{main|Rio Declaration on Environment and Development}}
The [[Rio Declaration]] of 1992 enshrines public participation in its 27 principles. Principle 10 states that "environmental issues are best handled with participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level". The [[Rio Declaration]] continues, drawing a close link between access to [[information]] and public participation: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the national level, each individual shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities, including information on hazardous materials and activities in their communities, and the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. States shall facilitate and encourage public awareness and participation by making information widely available. Effective access to judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=78&amp;ArticleID=1163 |title=Rio Declaration - Rio Declaration on Environment and Development - United Nations Environment Programme |publisher=UNEP |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ===
{{main|Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities}}
The 2006 [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] recognised that "disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others" and that "persons with disabilities continue to face barriers in their participation as equal members of society."

The Convention makes participation of disabled one of its principles, stating "The principles of the present Convention shall be:...Full and effective participation and inclusion in society;", subsequently    enshrining the right of disabled to participate fully and equally in the community, education, all aspect of life (in the context of habilitation and [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]]), political and public life, cultural life, leisure and sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml |title=Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities |publisher=Un.org |date=2007-03-30 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''remix service''' is a service (company or organization) that provides [[remix]]ed music to [[disc jockey]]s.

==History==
In the United States, the [[disco]] craze of the late 1970s led to the release of extended "disco" versions of songs, most of which were released on [[12-inch single|12" vinyl singles]]. Many of these were not easily [[Beatmixing|beatmixed]], so DJs started to laboriously edit songs by splicing [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape copies, making their own, unique versions that were better structured for a dancefloor.

1977 saw the creation of the first remix service, Disconet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.djsportal.com/en/pioneer/index.php?id=disconet| title=Disconet Story| work=DjsPortal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These companies gathered DJs and producers together to create monthly, promotional-only compilation albums containing re-edits, remixes, or [[List of musical medleys|medleys]] that were intended specifically for club DJs.

By 1994, there was a saturation of remix services, most of which typically remixed the same tracks as their competitor. At that point, the RIAA got involved and began notifying remix services that they needed to have clear permission from publishers or face litigation. Coincidentally, the services that survived the fallout (Ultimix, X-mix, Hot Tracks, Wicked Mix) all featured remixers that currently had radio mix-shows. In exchange for allowing remixing of certain tracks, remixers could be counted on by the labels to help "break" the new song they were trying to promote by featuring the track heavily in their mix-show.

While some services decided to ultimately cease operations, mixes began to pop up at most DJ record shops. It should be noted that an effort was made by one of the larger services to clear a way for all services to become legal. The idea was for every service to pay either a flat fee or a percentage of sales to a commission who would then allocate the money to the publishers whose tracks were used. This idea was rebuffed by the labels.

==Modern mixes==
Over the years, the remixes featured on these compilations have varied from simple edits, adding a mixable intro and outro to a song, or full-fledged, digital, multi-track remixes that barely resemble the original track. Many remix services have focused on a specific style of music (such as [[hip-hop]] or [[rock (music)|rock]]) or type of remix (such as [[house music|house]] mixes of pop hits).

As of 2006, there have been over 50 official remix services worldwide with at least as many spinoffs, although most of these companies (including Disconet) have long since folded due to financial or legal reasons. All remix services are required to get the original [[record label]] or artists' permission to edit and release a track, but many bootleg services exist that do not.

==Distribution==
Most of these companies required a DJ subscription agreement to buy the records or CDs, and each issue was typically limited in quantity from 100 to several thousand. Many of these compilations have become sought after collectors items as a result. Once in a while a remix service version of a song is released commercially by the artist's record label, but 99% of remix service mixes are sold only to DJs on the compilations.

==Notable companies==
Some of these companies helped launch the careers of many well-known remixers/producers.

[[Chris Cox (DJ)|Chris Cox]] (formerly of [[Thunderpuss]]) worked for [[Hot Tracks (remix service)|Hot Tracks]] (now Select Mix). [[Armand Van Helden]] created mixes for Mega-Mixx and X-Mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xmix.com| title=XMix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Markus Schulz]], [[C. L. McSpadden]] and [[Aaron Scofield|Aaron "The Pimp" Scofield]] made mixes for Powerhouse - after the company folded Scofield and McSpadden offered remixes through Culture Shock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/cultureshockremix| title=About Culture Shock| work=CultureShockRemix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Schulz releases remixes and original compositions through his own Coldharbour Recordings label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.markusschulz.com| title=MarkusSchulz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Liebrand]] released numerous remixes with DMC. A few companies/artists besides Schulz have also developed their own commercial record labels to release new tracks.

The UK-based DMC remix service probably has the most members in the world, with offices in nearly every country, and that they sponsor the yearly World DJ Championships as well as releasing many commercial compilations.

==Megamixes==
Many remix services issues also contain [[megamix]]es. A megamix contains multiple songs mixed together, sometimes in rapid succession. They can consist of a single artist (just [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] songs, etc.) or multiple artists. Some may follow a theme as well (Christmas, only songs that have "queen" in the title, only [[David Morales (Disc Jockey)|David Morales]] mixes, etc.). Often megamixes are also called medleys.

Megamixes are also commonly found on commercial releases, sometimes using the same mix previously released to DJs on a remix service. The earlier [[Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers|Jive Bunny &amp; The Mastermixers]] series of 50s and 60s megamixes were originally released on the [[Music Factory]] Mastermix service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mastermixdj.com/paris/frameset.asp|title=MasterMix.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617185030/http://www.mastermixdj.com/paris/frameset.asp|archivedate=2008-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among modern services, Ultimix is well known for producing several megamixes every year based on popular songs of the year ("flashback medleys") as well as some single artist megamixes. Culture Shock has the "Hit "AC" Megamixes" on their main series derived from their now defunct [[Radio programming|radio show]], as well as a satellite series entitled "Use Alternative Routes" which contains [[Modern rock|Modern Rock]] megamixes. Similarly, the UK-based DMC and Music Factory Mastermix remix services frequently include megamixes on their issues.

Chao's parents were instrumental in her decision to pursue acting;&lt;ref name="fandangobio"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.fandango.com/search?q=Riosalind+Chao&amp;mode=general|title= Rosalind Chao Biography|accessdate= 2007-12-30|publisher= [[Fandango (ticket service)|Fandango]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; she began at the age of five in a California-based [[Peking opera]] traveling company at the instigation of her parents who were already heavily involved, and during the summers they sent her to [[Taiwan]] to further develop her acting.&lt;ref name="20080201OCR"&gt;{{cite news | first = Paul | last = Hodgins | title = A career made from scratch | url = http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/rosalind-89509-chao-actress.html | work = [[The Orange County Register]] | publisher = [[Terry Horne]] | location = [[Santa Ana, California]], united states | date = February 1, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 | quote = Former Star Trek actress Rosalind Chao talks about her latest work with playwright Neil LaBute. }}&lt;/ref&gt; She later performed in [[television advertisement|television commercials]] and [[guest appearance|guest starred]] on TV series in her [[adolescence|teenage years]].  Her first acting role was in the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', but she was first noticed performing in another CBS sitcom: 1972's short-lived ''[[Anna and the King (TV series)|Anna and the King]]'' as the eponymous king's ([[Yul Brynner]]) eldest daughter.&lt;ref name="y!bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800126114/bio|title=Rosalind Chao Biography|work=[[Yahoo!

Dropping out of acting, Chao enrolled in the communications department at the [[University of Southern California]] where she earned her degree in journalism.  However, after spending a year as a radio newswriting [[internship|intern]] at the CBS-owned Hollywood radio station [[KNX (AM)|KNX]],&lt;ref name="20080201OCR"/&gt; she soon returned to acting.&lt;ref name="y!bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fandangobio"/&gt;

Remembering Chao from ''Anna and the King'',&lt;ref name="fandangobio"/&gt; television producer [[Burt Metcalfe]] provided her big break with the role of Soon-Lee, a South Korean refugee, in the final episodes of the TV series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''.&lt;ref name="y!bio"/&gt; Soon-Lee [[war bride|married]] longtime starring character [[Maxwell Klinger]] ([[Jamie Farr]]) in the series finale "[[Goodbye, Farewell and Amen]]",&lt;ref name="gf&amp;amen"&gt;{{cite episode| title        = Goodbye, Farewell and Amen| episodelink  = Goodbye, Farewell and Amen| series       = M*A*S*H| serieslink   = M*A*S*H (TV series)

Chao continued playing the character in the ''M*A*S*H'' sequel: 1983's ''[[AfterMASH]]'', her first role billed at co-starring status.&lt;ref name="AfterMASH"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mash4077tv.com/articles/aftermash/|title= AfterMASH: Main Article|accessdate= 2007-12-30|author= RJ|format= embedded video|publisher= MASH4077TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chao regularly portrayed the Japanese exo-botanist [[Keiko O'Brien]] (née Ishikawa) on both ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''  with eight appearances in the former and 19 in the latter before ''DS9''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s end in 1999.  In 2010, a preliminary casting memo for ''The Next Generation'' from 1987 was published, revealing that Chao was originally considered for the part of ''Enterprise'' security chief [[Tasha Yar]].&lt;ref name="trektoday20100826"&gt;{{cite web| url         = http://www.trektoday.com/content/2010/08/star-trek-the-next-generation-casting-memo-unearthed/| title       = Star Trek: The Next Generation Casting Memo Unearthed| author      = T'Bonz| date        = August 26, 2010| publisher   = | location    = | accessdate  = 2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- to really keep this section, it needs more weight to Ms. Chao, not plot.  I've culled and trimmed, and will look for such in Star Trek materials before doing anything with --&gt;

==Personal life==
While doing theatre at the Mark Taper Forum, Chao met [[Simon Templeman]]; the couple would eventually wed. They have two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://showbizgeek.com/what-ever-happened-to-the-cast-of-star-trek-the-next-generation/|title=What Ever Happened To... the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation?|publisher=Show Biz Geek|date=January 17, 2014|accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ForutuneWheel.jpg|right|thumb|From an edition of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio's]] ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]'' showing Lady Fortune spinning her wheel.]]
In medieval and ancient philosophy the '''Wheel of Fortune''', or '''''Rota Fortunae''''', is a symbol of the capricious nature of [[destiny|Fate]]. The wheel belongs to the goddess [[Fortuna (mythology)|Fortuna]] (Greek equivalent [[Tyche]]) who spins it at random, changing the positions of those on the wheel: some suffer great misfortune, others gain windfalls.  Fortune appears on all paintings as a woman, sometimes blindfolded, "puppeteering" a wheel.

==Origins==
The origin of the word is from the "wheel of fortune" - the [[zodiac]], referring to the [[Celestial spheres]] of which the 8th holds the stars, and the 9th is where the signs of the zodiac are placed. The concept was first invented in Babylon and later developed by the [[Hellenistic Greece|ancient Greeks]].

The concept somewhat resembles the ''[[Bhavacakra]]'', or Wheel of Becoming, depicted throughout Ancient Indian art and literature, except that the earliest conceptions in the Roman and Greek world involve not a two-dimensional wheel but a three-dimensional sphere, a metaphor for the world.  It was widely used in the Ptolemaic perception of the universe as the [[zodiac]] being a wheel with its "signs" constantly turning throughout the year and having effect on the world's fate (or fortune).

[[Image:PeuerbachSuperioribus2.png|225px|right|thumb|Ptolemaic model of the spheres for Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn with [[epicycle]], eccentric [[deferent]] and [[equant]] point.  [[Georg von Peuerbach]], ''Theoricae novae planetarum'', 1474.]]
[[Vettius Valens]], a second century BC astronomer and astrologer, wrote:
::There are many wheels, most moving from west to east, but some move from east to west.
::Seven wheels, each hold one heavenly object, the first holds the moon...
::Then the eighth wheel holds all the stars that we see...

::And the ninth wheel, the wheel of fortunes, moves from east to west, 
::and includes each of the twelve signs of fortune, the twelve signs of the zodiac.
::Each wheel is inside the other, like an onion's peel sits inside another peel, and there is no empty space between them.{{cite quote|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Christine de Pizan, Folio 41r 'Wheel of Fortune' from Epitre d'Othéa; Les Sept Sacrements de l'Eglise, c. 1455 at Waddesdon Manor (cropped).jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Jean Mielot]] to [[Christine de Pizan]]'s ''Epitre d'Othéa; Les Sept Sacrements de l'Eglise'', c. 1455 at [[Waddesdon Manor]]]]

In the same century, the Roman tragedian [[Pacuvius]] wrote:

{{quote|text=Fortunam insanam esse et caecam et brutam perhibent philosophi,&lt;br /&gt;
Saxoque instare in globoso praedicant volubili:&lt;br /&gt;
Id quo saxum inpulerit fors, eo cadere Fortunam autumant.&lt;br /&gt;
Caecam ob eam rem esse iterant, quia nihil cernat, quo sese adplicet; &lt;br /&gt;
Insanam autem esse aiunt, quia atrox, incerta instabilisque sit; &lt;br /&gt;
Brutam, quia dignum atque indignum nequeat internoscere.

Philosophers say that Fortune is insane and blind and stupid,&lt;br /&gt;
and they teach that she stands on a rolling, spherical rock:&lt;br /&gt;
they affirm that, wherever chance pushes that rock, Fortuna falls in that direction.&lt;br /&gt;
They repeat that she is blind for this reason: that she does not see where she's heading;&lt;br /&gt;
they say she's insane, because she is cruel, flaky and unstable;&lt;br /&gt;
stupid, because she can't distinguish between the worthy and the unworthy.|sign=[[Pacuvius]]|source=''Scaenicae Romanorum Poesis Fragmenta. Vol. 
1'', ed. O. Ribbeck, 1897}}

The idea of the rolling ball of fortune became a [[literary topos]] and was used frequently in declamation.  In fact, the ''Rota Fortunae'' became a prime example of a trite topos or [[meme]] for [[Tacitus]], who mentions its rhetorical overuse in the ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]''.

===Boethius===

The goddess and her Wheel were eventually absorbed into Western medieval thought. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] philosopher [[Boethius]] (c. 480-524) played a key role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patch|first1=H.R.|title=The Goddess Fortuna in Medieval Literature|date=1927|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing both her and her Wheel in his ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|Consolatio Philosophiae]]''. For example, from the first chapter of the second book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know the manifold deceits of that monstrous lady, Fortune; in particular, her fawning friendship with those whom she intends to cheat, until the moment when she unexpectedly abandons them, and leaves them reeling in agony beyond endurance.

[...]

Having entrusted yourself to Fortune's dominion, you must conform to your mistress's ways. What, are you trying to halt the motion of her whirling wheel? Dimmest of fools that you are, you must realize that if the wheel stops turning, it ceases to be the course of chance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boethius|title=The Consolation of Philosophy|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-954054-9|pages=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In the middle ages ==
[[Image:Edward Burne-Jones - The Wheel of Fortune.jpg|thumb|left|''The Wheel of Fortune'' by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], 1875-83]]

===Religious instruction===
The Wheel was widely used as an [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|allegory]] in medieval literature and art to aid religious instruction. Though classically Fortune's Wheel could be favourable and disadvantageous, medieval writers preferred to concentrate on the tragic aspect, dwelling on downfall of the mighty - serving to remind people of the temporality of earthly things. In the [[morality play]] ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'' (c. 1495), for instance, Death comes unexpectedly to claim the protagonist. Fortune's Wheel has spun Everyman low, and Good Deeds, which he previously neglected, are needed to secure his passage to heaven.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] used the concept of the tragic Wheel of Fortune a great deal. It forms the basis for the ''[[Monk's Tale]]'', which recounts stories of the great brought low throughout history, including [[Lucifer]], [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], [[Samson]], [[Hercules]], [[Nebuchadnezzar]], [[Belshazzar]], [[Nero]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]] and, in the following passage, [[Peter I of Cyprus]].

:O noble Peter, Cyprus' lord and king,
:Which Alexander won by mastery,
:To many a heathen ruin did'st thou bring;
:For this thy lords had so much jealousy,
:That, for no crime save thy high chivalry,
:All in thy bed they slew thee on a morrow.
:And thus does Fortune's wheel turn treacherously
:And out of happiness bring men to sorrow.
~ Geoffrey Chaucer, ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', The Monk's Tale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/gchaucer/bl-gchau-can-monk.htm |title=The Monk's Tale, Modern English - Canterbury Tales - Geoffrey Chaucer (1340?-1400) |publisher=Classiclit.about.com |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortune's Wheel often turns up in medieval art, from manuscripts to the great [[Rose window]]s in many medieval cathedrals, which are based on the Wheel. Characteristically, it has four shelves, or stages of life, with four human figures, usually labeled on the left ''regnabo'' (I shall reign), on the top ''regno'' (I reign) and is usually crowned, descending on the right ''regnavi'' (I have reigned) and the lowly figure on the bottom is marked ''sum sine regno'' (I am without a kingdom). [[Dante]] employed the Wheel in the ''[[The Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'' and a "[[Wheel of Fortune (Tarot card)|Wheel of Fortune]]" trump-card appeared in the [[Tarot]] deck (circa 1440, Italy).

===Political instruction===
[[Image:CarminaBurana wheel.jpg|thumb|right|The wheel of fortune from the ''[[Carmina Burana|Burana Codex]]''; The figures are labelled "Regno, Regnavi, Sum sine regno, Regnabo": I reign, I reigned, My reign is finished, I shall reign]]
In the medieval and renaissance period, a popular genre of writing was "'''[[Mirror-of-princes writing|Mirrors for Princes]]'''", which set out advice for the ruling classes on how to wield power (the most famous being ''[[The Prince]]'' by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]). Such political treatises could use the concept of the Wheel of Fortune as an instructive guide to their readers. [[John Lydgate]]'s ''Fall of Princes'', written for his patron [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] is a noteworthy example.

Many [[Arthurian]] [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] of the era also use the concept of the Wheel in this manner, often placing the [[Nine Worthies]] on it at various points.

&lt;blockquote&gt;...fortune is so variant, and the wheel so moveable, there nis none constant abiding, and that may be proved by many old chronicles, of noble [[Hector]], and [[Troilus]], and [[Alexander the Great|Alisander]], the mighty conqueror, and many mo other; when they were most in their royalty, they alighted lowest. 
~ [[Lancelot]] in [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Chapter XVII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/lit/epics/LeMortedArthur/chap247.html |title=Le Morte d' Arthur - Chapter XVII |publisher=Worldwideschool.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411043318/http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/lit/epics/LeMortedArthur/chap247.html |archivedate=2016-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like the Mirrors for Princes, this could be used to convey advice to readers. For instance, in most romances, Arthur's greatest military achievement - the conquest of the [[Roman Empire]] - is placed late on in the overall story. However, in Malory's work the Roman conquest and high point of [[King Arthur]]'s reign is established very early on. Thus, everything that follows is something of a decline. Arthur, Lancelot and the other [[Knights of the Round Table]] are meant to be the paragons of [[chivalry]], yet in Malory's telling of the story they are doomed to failure. In medieval thinking, only [[God]] was perfect, and even a great figure like King Arthur had to be brought low. For the noble reader of the tale in the Middle Ages, this moral could serve as a warning, but also as something to aspire to. Malory could be using the concept of Fortune's Wheel to imply that if even the greatest of chivalric knights made mistakes, then a normal fifteenth-century noble didn't have to be a paragon of virtue in order to be a good knight.

===Carmina Burana===
The Wheel of Fortune motif appears significantly in the ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' (or ''Burana Codex''), albeit with a postclassical phonetic spelling of the genitive form ''Fortunae''.  Excerpts from two of the collection's better known poems, "''Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi'' (Fortune, Empress of the World)" and "''Fortune Plango Vulnera'' (I Bemoan the Wounds of Fortune)," read:

==Later usage==
Fortune and her Wheel have remained an enduring image throughout history. Fortune's wheel can also be found in Thomas More's ''Utopia''.

===Shakespeare===
[[File:Wheel of fortune.png|thumb|210px|Wheel of fortune in [[Sebastian Brant]]`s ''[[Narrenschiff]]'', woodcut by A. Dürer]]
[[William Shakespeare]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'' wrote of the "slings and arrows of outrageous fortune" and, of fortune personified, to "break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel." And in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', Act 3 Scene VI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/shakespeare/henryV/16/ |title=King Henry V by William Shakespeare: Act 3. Scene VI |publisher=Online-literature.com |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the lines:

:''Pistol:''
:''Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart
:''And of buxom valor, hath by cruel fate''
:''And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel''
:''That goddess blind,''
:''That stands upon the rolling restless stone—''
:''Fluellen:''
:''By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is painted blind, with a muffler afore his eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning, and inconstant, and mutability, and variation. And her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls, and rolls, and rolls.''
:''Pistol:''
:''Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;''
Shakespeare also references this Wheel in ''[[King Lear]]''. The Earl of Kent, who was once held dear by the King, has been banished, only to return in disguise. This disguised character is placed in the stocks for an overnight and laments this turn of events at the end of Act II, Scene 2:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/70/4322.html |title=Act II. Scene II. King Lear. Craig, W.J., ed. 1914. The Oxford Shakespeare |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Fortune, good night, smile once more; turn thy wheel!''

In Act IV, scene vii, King Lear also contrasts his misery on the "wheel of fire" to Cordelia's "soul in bliss".

Rosalind and Celia also discuss Fortune, especially as it stands opposed to Nature, in ''As You Like It'', Act I, scene ii.

===Victorian era===
In [[Anthony Trollope]]'s novel ''[[The Way We Live Now]]'', the character Lady Carbury writes a novel entitled ''The Wheel of Fortune'' about a heroine who suffers great financial hardships.

===Modern day===
Selections from the ''Carmina Burana'', including the two poems quoted above, were set to new music by twentieth-century classical composer [[Carl Orff]], whose well-known "[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|O Fortuna]]" is based on the poem ''Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi''.

==== Literature ====
[[Fortuna]] does occasionally turn up in modern literature, although these days she has become more or less synonymous with [[wiktionary:Lady Luck|Lady Luck]]. Her Wheel is less widely used as a symbol, and has been replaced largely by a reputation for fickleness. She is often associated with gamblers, and [[dice]] could also be said to have replaced the Wheel as the primary metaphor for uncertain fortune. In his novel, ''[[The Club Dumas]]'', [[Arturo Pérez-Reverte]] includes a wheel of fortune in one of the [http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4495/3071/1600/8NGc.jpg illustrations that accompany the text]. Ignatius J. Reilly, the central protagonist of [[John Kennedy Toole]]'s novel ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'', states that he believes the Rota Fortunae to be the source of all men's fate.

==== Popular music ====
[[Jerry Garcia]] recorded a song entitled "The Wheel" (co-written with [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]] and [[Bill Kreutzmann]]) for his 1972 solo album ''Garcia'', and performed the song regularly with the [[Grateful Dead]] from 1976 onward. The song "[[Wheel in the Sky]]" by [[Journey (band)|Journey]] from their 1978 release ''[[Infinity (Journey album)|Infinity]]'' also touches on the concept through the lyrics "''Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin' / I don't know where I'll be tomorrow''". The song "Throw Your Hatred Down" by [[Neil Young]] on his 1995 album ''[[Mirror Ball (Neil Young album)|Mirror Ball]]'', recorded with [[Pearl Jam]], has the verse "The wheel of fortune / Keeps on rollin' down". The Trip-Hop group Massive Attack refer to the Wheel of Fortune on their track "Hymn Of The Big Wheel" on the 1991 album [[Blue Lines]].

==== Folk music====
Several old folk tunes mention the wheel of fortune, most notably 'Fakenham Fair' with its chorus lyrics of 'So spin me around on the merry-go-round/Give the wheel of fortune a whirl'.

==== Film and television ====
Various games of chance involve spinning a wheel marked with preset outcomes, mirroring the "wheel of fortune" concept. This is notably done on the long-running, internationally syndicated game show [[Wheel of Fortune in different countries|''Wheel of Fortune'']], where contestants win or lose money determined by the spin of the wheel. Such a wheel is also featured in the game show ''[[The Price Is Right]]'', in the "[[Showcase Showdown]]" segment. In the 1985 film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'', such a wheel was used to determine punishments for criminals.

The 1994 film ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]'' refers often to the Rota Fortunae concept, especially in its use of circles as a visual motif. In the TV series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (2002), the main character, Malcolm Reynolds, says "The Wheel never stops turning, Badger" to which Badger replies "That only matters to the people on the rim". In the science fiction TV series ''[[Farscape]]'', the third-season episode "Self-Inflicted Wounds (Part 2): Wait for the Wheel" has main character Crichton mention that his grandmother told him that fate was like a wheel, alternately bringing fortunes up and down.

==== Games ====
The video game series character [[Kain (Legacy of Kain)]] used the wheel of fate. In the&amp;nbsp;[[Fable (video game series)|''Fable''&amp;nbsp;video game series]], the wheel of fortune appears twice, somehow perverted. The Wheel of Unholy Misfortune is a torture device in&amp;nbsp;''[[Fable II]]''. It is found in the Temple of Shadows in Rookridge. The Hero can use the wheel to sacrifice followers to the shadows. In&amp;nbsp;''[[Fable III]]'', Reaver's Wheel of Misfortune is a device that, once activated, sends to The Hero a round of random monsters.

The Wheel of Fortune is featured in a ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' card by that name that forces all players to discard their hands and draw new ones.

{{Jainism}}
'''''Sallekhana''''' ([[IAST]]: {{IAST|sallekhanā}}), also known as '''''Samlehna''''', '''''Santhara''''',  '''''Samadhi-marana''''' or '''''Sanyasana-marana''''';&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is a supplementary vow to the [[Ethics of Jainism|ethical code of conduct]] of [[Jainism]]. It is the religious practice of voluntarily fasting to death by gradually reducing the intake of food and liquids.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=179–181}} It is viewed in Jainism as the thinning of human passions and the body,{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=115}} and another means of destroying rebirth-influencing [[karma]] by withdrawing all physical and mental activities.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=179–181}} It is not considered as a suicide by Jain scholars because it is not an act of passion, nor does it deploy poisons or weapons.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=179–181}} After the ''sallekhana'' vow, the ritual preparation and practice can extend into years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Sallekhana'' is a vow available to both for Jain [[Jain monasticism|ascetics]] and [[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|householders]].{{sfn|Battin|2015|p=47}} Historic evidence such as ''nishidhi'' engravings suggest ''sallekhana'' was observed by both men and women, including queens, in Jain history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in the modern era, death through ''sallekhana'' has been a relatively uncommon event.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=181}}

There is debate about the practice from a [[right to life]] and a [[freedom of religion]] viewpoint. In 2015, the [[Rajasthan High Court]] banned the practice, considering it [[suicide]]. Later that year, the [[Supreme Court of India]] stayed the decision of the Rajasthan High Court and lifted the ban on ''Sallekhana''.&lt;ref name=Milind/&gt;

==Vow==
{{See also|Ethics of Jainism}}

{{anchor|Mahavrata}}There are Five Great vows prescribed to followers of Jainism; ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]]'' (non-violence), ''[[Satya]]'' (not lying), ''[[Asteya]]'' (not stealing), ''[[Brahmacharya]]'' (chastity), and ''[[Aparigraha]]'' ([[non-possession]]).{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=4}} A further seven supplementary vows are also prescribed, which include three ''Gunavratas'' (merit vows) and four ''Shiksha vratas'' (disciplinary vows). The three ''Gunavratas'' are:  ''Digvrata'' (limited movements, limiting one's area of activity), ''Bhogopabhogaparimana'' (limiting use of consumable and non-consumable things), and ''Anartha-dandaviramana'' (abstain from purposeless sins). The ''Shikshavratas'' include: ''[[Samayika]]'' (vow to meditate and concentrate for limited periods), ''Desavrata'' (limiting movement and space of activity for limited periods), ''Prosadhopavāsa'' (fasting for limited periods), and ''Atithi-samvibhag'' (offering food to the ascetic).{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=87-91}}{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=5}}&lt;ref&gt;Pravin K. Shah, [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/12vows.htm Twelve Vows of Layperson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511072328/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/12vows.htm |date=11 May 2016 }}, Jainism Literature Center, Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sallekhana'' is treated as a supplementary to these twelve vows. However, some Jain teachers such as [[Kundakunda]], [[Devasena (Jain monk)|Devasena]], Padmanandin, and Vasunandin have included it under ''Shikshavratas''.{{sfn|Williams|1991|p=166}}

''Sallekhana'' ({{lang-sa|Sallikhita}}) means to properly 'thin out', 'scour out' or 'slender' the passions and the body through gradually abstaining from food and drink.{{sfn|Kakar|2014|p=174}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=179–181}} ''Sallekhana'' is divided into two components: ''Kashaya Sallekhana'' (slenderising of passions) or ''Abhayantra Sallekhana'' (internal slendering) and  ''Kaya Sallekhana'' (slenderising the body) or ''Bahya Sallekhana'' (external slendering).{{sfn|Settar|1989|p=113}} It is described as "facing death voluntarily through fasting".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to [[Jain texts]], ''Sallekhana'' leads to ''Ahimsa'' (non-violence or non-injury), as a person observing ''Sallekhana'' subjugates the passions, which are the root cause of ''Himsa'' (injury or violence).{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=116}}

==Conditions==
[[File:Sallekhana.pdf|thumb|alt=Sallekhana as expounded in the Jain text, Ratna Karanda Sravakachara|''Sallekhana'' as expounded in the Jain text, ''Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra'']]
While ''Sallekhana'' is prescribed for both ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|householders]]'' and [[Jain monasticism|ascetics]], Jain texts describe conditions when it is appropriate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=181}}{{sfn|Tukol|1976|pp=7–8}} It should not be observed by a householder without guidance of a Jain ascetic.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=231}}

Sallekhana is always voluntary, undertaken after public declaration, and never assisted with any chemicals or tools. The fasting causes thinning away of body by withdrawing by choice food and water to oneself. As death is imminent, the individual stops all food and water, with full knowledge of colleagues and spiritual counsellor.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=16}} In some cases, Jains with terminal illness undertake ''sallekhana'', and in these cases they ask for permission from their spiritual counsellor.{{sfn|Battin|2015|p=46}}{{refn|group=note|According to Somasundaram, ''Sallekhana'' is allowed in Jainism when normal religious life is not possible because of old age, extreme calamities, famine, incurable disease or when a person is nearing their death.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Somasundaram|first=Ottilingam|last2=Murthy|first2=AG Tejus|last3=Raghavan|first3=DVijaya|date=2016-10-01|title=Jainism – Its relevance to psychiatric practice; with special reference to the practice of Sallekhana|url=http://www.indianjpsychiatry.org/text.asp?2016/58/4/471/196702|journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=58|issue=4|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.196702|pmc=5270277|pmid=28197009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228111528/http://www.indianjpsychiatry.org/text.asp?2016%2F58%2F4%2F471%2F196702|archivedate=28 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} For a successful ''sallekhana'', the death must be with "pure means", voluntary, planned, undertaken with calmness, peace and joy where the person accepts to scour out the body and focuses his or her mind on spiritual matters.{{sfn|Battin|2015|p=47}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=179–181}}

''Sallekhana'' differs from other forms of ritual deaths recognized in Jainism as appropriate.{{sfn|Battin|2015|p=48}} The other situations consider ritual death to be better for a mendicant than breaking his or her [[#Mahavrata|Five Great vow]]s (''Mahavrata'').{{sfn|Battin|2015|p=48}} For example, celibacy is one of the Five vows, and ritual death is considered better than being raped or seduced or if the mendicant community would be defamed. A ritual death under these circumstances by consuming poison is believed to be better and allows for an auspicious rebirth.{{sfn|Battin|2015|p=48}}

==Procedure==
The duration of the practice can vary from a few days to years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Mascarenhas |first=Anuradha |title=Doc firm on Santhara despite HC ban: I too want a beautiful death |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/doc-firm-on-santhara-despite-hc-ban-i-too-want-a-beautiful-death |work=[[The Indian Express]] |date=25 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204114602/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/doc-firm-on-santhara-despite-hc-ban-i-too-want-a-beautiful-death/ |archivedate=4 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth part of the ''Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra'' describes ''Sallekhana'' and its procedure{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|pp=58–64}} as follows— {{quote|Giving up solid food by degrees, one should take to milk and whey, then giving them up, to hot or spiced water. 
[Subsequently] giving up hot water also, and observing fasting with full determination, he should give up his body, trying in every possible way to keep in mind the [[Namokar Mantra|pancha-namaskara mantra]].|Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra (127–128){{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|pp=58–64}}}}

Jain texts mention five transgressions (''Atichara'') of the vow: the desire to be reborn as a human, the desire to be reborn as a divinity, the desire to continue living, the desire to die quickly, and the desire to live a sensual life in the next life. Other transgressions include: recollection of affection for friends, recollection of the pleasures enjoyed, and longing for the enjoyment of pleasures in the future.{{sfn|Williams|1991|p=170}}{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=10}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=111}}

{{anchor|three forms}}The ancient Svetambara Jain text ''[[Acharanga Sutra]]'', dated to about 3rd or 2nd century BCE, describes three forms of ''Sallekhana'': the ''Bhaktapratyakhyana'', the ''Ingita-marana,'' and the ''Padapopagamana''. In ''Bhaktapratyakhyana'', the person who wants to observe the vow selects an isolated place where he lies on a bed made of straw, does not move his limbs, and avoids food and drink until he dies. In ''Ingita-marana'', the person sleeps on bare ground. He can sit, stand, walk, or move, but avoids food until he dies. In ''Padapopagamana'', a person stands "like a tree" without food and drink until he dies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another variation of ''Sallekhana'' is ''Itvara'' which consists of voluntarily restricting oneself in a limited space and then fasting to death.{{sfn|Battin|2015|p=48}}

==History==

===Textual===
The ''[[Acharanga Sutra]]'' ({{circa|5th century BCE|1st century BCE}}) describes [[#three forms|three forms]] of the practice. Early [[Svetambara]]{{refn|group=note|[[Svetambara]] and [[Digambara]] are two major sects of Jainism. See [[Jain schools and branches]].}} text ''Shravakaprajnapti'' notes that the practice is not limited to ascetics. The [[Vyākhyāprajñapti|Bhagavati Sūtra]] (2.1) also describes ''Sallekhana'' in great detail, as it was observed by Skanda Katyayana, an ascetic of [[Mahavira]]. The 4th century text ''[[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]],'' and the Svetambara text ''Nava-pada-prakarana,'' also provide detailed descriptions. The ''Nava-pada-prakarana'' mentions seventeen methods of "voluntarily chosen death", of which it approves only three as consistent with the teachings of Jainism.{{sfn|Williams|1991|p=166}} The practice is also mentioned  in the 2nd century CE [[Sangam period|Sangam era]] poem ''Sirupanchamoolam''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The ''Panchashaka'' makes only a cursory mention of the practice and it is not described in ''Dharmabindu'' – both texts by [[Haribhadra]] ({{circa|5th century}}). In the 9th century text "[[Ādi purāṇa]]" by [[Jinasena]] the [[#three forms|three forms]] are described. ''Yashastilaka'' by [[Somadeva Suri|Somadeva]] (10th century) also describes the practice. Other writers like Vaddaradhane (10th century) and Lalitaghate also describe the ''Padapopagamana'', one of its forms. [[Hemchandra]] ({{circa|11th century}}) describes it in a short passage despite his detailed coverage of the observances of householders (''Shravakachara'').&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://isjs.in/sites/isjs.in/files/docs/Nishidhi%20Stones%20by%20A.%20Sundara.pdf|title=Nishidhi Stones and the ritual of Sallekhana|last=Sundara|first=A.|date=|website=International School for Jain Studies|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228111226/https://www.isjs.in/sites/isjs.in/files/docs/Nishidhi%20Stones%20by%20A.%20Sundara.pdf|archive-date=28 February 2018|dead-url=|access-date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|1991|p=166}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=179–181}}

According to ''[[Tattvartha Sutra]]'', "a householder willingly or voluntary adopts ''Sallekhana'' when death is very near."{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=10}} According to the medieval era Jain text, ''[[Puruşārthasiddhyupāya]]'', both the ascetics and the householder should "court voluntarily death at the end of life", thinking that only sallekhana is a pious death.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|pp=112–115}} The ''Silappadikaram'' (Epic of the Anklet) by the Jain prince-turned-monk, Ilango Adigal, mentions ''Sallekhana'' by the Jain nun, Kaundi Adigal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Archeological===
In [[South India]], especially [[Karnataka]], a [[hero stone|memorial stone]] or footprint is erected to commemorate the death of person who observed ''Sallekhana''. This is known as ''Nishidhi'', ''Nishidige'' or ''Nishadiga''. The term is derived from the Sanskrit root ''Sid'' or ''Sad'' which means "to attain" or "waste away".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These ''Nishidhis'' detail the names, dates, the duration of the vow, and other austerities performed by the person who observed the vow. The earliest ''Nishidhis'' (6th to 8th century) mostly have an inscription on the rock without any symbols. This style continued until the 10th century when footprints were added alongside the inscription. After the 11th century, ''Nishidhis'' are inscribed on slabs or pillars with panels and symbols. These slabs or pillars were frequently erected in ''[[mandapa]]''s (pillared pavilions), near ''[[basadi]]'' (temples), or sometimes as an inscription on the door frame or pillars of the temple.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[Shravanabelgola]] in Karnataka, ninety-three ''Nishidhis'' are found ranging from circa 6th century to the 19th century. Fifty-four of them belong to the period circa 6th to the 8th century. It is believed that a large number of ''Nishidhis'' at Shravanabelgola follow the earlier tradition. Several inscriptions after 600 CE record that [[Chandragupta Maurya]] ({{circa|300 BCE}}) and his teacher [[Bhadrabahu]] observed the vow atop [[Chandragiri Hill]] at Sharavnabelagola. Historians such as [[Radha Kumud Mukherjee|R. K. Mookerji]] consider the accounts unproven, but plausible.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=39–41}}{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=19–20}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sebastian |first=Pradeep |title=The nun's tale |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-literaryreview/the-nuns-tale/article662328.ece |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=15 September 2010 |orig-year=1 November 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114053258/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-literaryreview/the-nuns-tale/article662328.ece |archivedate=14 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Mallick |first=Anuradha |last2=Ganapathy |first2=Priya |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/468410/on-spiritual-quest.html |title=On a spiritual quest |date=29 March 2015 |work=[[Deccan Herald]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924052938/http://www.deccanherald.com/content/468410/on-spiritual-quest.html |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice have dated it to 840 or 869 CE by its textual context.{{sfn|Rice|1982|p=13}} The memorial stone has a unique depiction in [[frieze]] of the ritual death (''Sallekhana'') of King Ereganga Nitimarga I ({{reign|853|869}}) of the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]]. It was raised by the king's son Satyavakya.{{sfn|Sarma|1992|p=17}}{{sfn|Sarma|1992|p=204}} In Shravanabelgola, the Kuge Brahmadeva pillar has a ''Nishidhi'' commemorating Marasimha, another Western Ganga king. An inscription on the pillar in front of Gandhavarna Basadi commemorates Indraraja, the grandson of the [[Rashtrakuta]] King Krishna III, who died in 982 after observing the vow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The inscriptions in South India suggest ''sallekhana'' was originally an ascetic practice which later extended to Jain householders. Its importance as an ideal death in the spiritual life of householders ceased by about the 12th century. The practice was revived in 1955 by the Digambara monk Acharya Santisagara.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=179–181}}

===Modern===
''Sallekhana'' is a respected practice in the [[Jain community]].{{sfn|Kakar|2014|p=173}} It has not been a "practical or general goal" among [[Svetambara]] Jains for many years. It was revived among [[Digambara monk]]s.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=179–181}} In 1955, Acharya [[Shantisagar]], a Digambara monk took the vow because of his inability to walk without help and his weak eye-sight.{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=98}}{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=100}}{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=104}} In 1999, Acharya [[Vidyanand]], another Digambara monk, took a twelve-year-long vow.{{sfn|Flügel|2006|p=353}}

Between 1800 and 1992, at least 37 instances of ''Sallekhana'' are recorded in Jain literature. There were 260 and 90 recorded Sallekhana deaths among Svetambara and Digambara Jains respectively between 1993 and 2003. According to Jitendra Shah, the Director of L D Institute of Indology in [[Ahmedabad]], an average of about 240 Jains practice ''Sallekhana'' each year in India. Most of them are not recorded or noticed.&lt;ref name=iex&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=74730 |title='Over 200 Jains embrace death every year' |work=Express India |date=30 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714055021/http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=74730|archive-date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistically, ''Sallekhana'' is undertaken both by men and women of all economic classes and among the educationally forward Jains. It is observed more often by women than men.{{sfn|Braun|2008|pp=913–924}}

== Legality and comparison with suicide ==
Jain texts make a clear distinction between the ''Sallekhana'' and suicide.{{sfn|Chapple|1993|p=102}} Its dualistic theology differentiates between soul and matter. Soul is reborn in the Jain belief based on accumulated karma, how one dies contributes to the karma accumulation, and a pious death reduces the negative karmic attachments.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=179–181}}{{sfn|Battin|2015|pp=46–48}}{{sfn|Pechilis|Raj|2013|p=90}} The preparation for ''sallekhana'' must begin early, much before the approach of death, and when death is imminent, the vow of ''Sallekhana'' is observed by progressively slenderising the body and the passions.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|pp=114–115}}

The comparison of ''Sallekhana'' with suicide is debated since the early time of Jainism. The early Buddhist Tamil epic ''Kundalakesi'' compared it to suicide. It is refuted in the contemporary Tamil Jain literature such as in ''Neelakesi''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Professor S. A. Jain cites differences between the motivations behind suicide and those behind Sallekhana to distinguish them:{{cquote
|It is argued that it is suicide, since there is voluntary severance of life etc. No, it is not suicide, as there is no passion. Without attachment etc, there is no passion in this undertaking. A person who kills himself by means of poison, weapon etc, swayed by attachment, aversion or infatuation, commits suicide. But he who practices holy death is free from desire, anger and delusion. Hence it is not suicide.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|pp=116–117}}}}

[[Champat Rai Jain]], a Jainist scholar wrote in 1934:

{{cquote|Soul is a simple substance and as such immortal. Death is for compounds  whose dissolution is termed disintegration and death when it has reference to a living organism, that is a compound of spirit and matter. By dying in the proper way will is developed, and it is a great asset for the future life of the soul, which, as a simple substance, will survive the bodily dissolution and death. The true idea of ''Sallekhana'' is only this that when death does appear at last one should know how to die, that is one should die like a man, not like a beast, bellowing and panting and making vain efforts to avoid the unavoidable.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1934|p=179}}}}

Modern era Indian activists have questioned this rationale, calling the voluntary choice of death as an evil similar to [[sati (practice)|sati]], and have attempted to legislate and judicially act against this religious custom.{{sfn|Battin|2015|pp=47–48}} Article 21 of the [[Constitution of India]], 1950, guarantees the [[right to life]] to all persons within the territory of India and its states. In ''Gian Kaur vs The State Of Punjab'', the state high court ruled, "... 'right to life' is a natural right embodied in Article 21 but suicide is an unnatural termination or extinction of life and, therefore, incompatible and inconsistent with the concept of right to life".&lt;ref name="GK1"&gt;{{cite web | title=Smt.

''Nikhil Soni vs Union of India'' (2006), a case filed in the [[Rajasthan High Court]], citing the ''[[Aruna Shanbaug case|Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug vs Union Of India]]'' case related to [[Euthanasia in India|euthanasia]], and the ''Gian Kaur'' case, argued, "No person has a right to take his own life consciously, as the right to life does not include the right to end the life voluntarily." So the petitioner cited ''Sallekhana'' as a suicide and thus punishable under Section 309 (attempt to commit suicide).&lt;ref name="NK2003"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nikhil Soni vs Union Of India &amp; Ors. on 10 August, 2015 | website=Indian Kanoon | date=24 May 2003 | url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/173301527/ | accessdate=24 April 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228111528/https://indiankanoon.org/doc/173301527/ | archivedate=28 February 2018 | df=dmy-all }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The case also extended to those who helped facilitate the deaths of individuals observing ''Sallekhana,'' finding they were culpable under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) with aiding and abetting an act of suicide. It was also argued that ''Sallekhana'' "serves as a means of coercing widows and elderly relatives into taking their own lives".{{sfn|Braun|2008|pp=913–924}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kumar |first1=Nandini K. |year=2006 |title=Bioethics activities in India |journal=Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal |volume=12 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S56–65 |pmid=17037690}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to commit suicide was a crime under [[Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code|Section 309]] of the [[Indian Penal Code]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/customs/fasting_1.shtml|title=Religions: Jainism: Fasting|date=2009-09-10|work=[[BBC]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707200636/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/customs/fasting_1.shtml|archivedate=7 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the Jain community argued that prohibiting the practice is a violation of their [[freedom of religion in India|freedom of religion]], a [[fundamental right]] guaranteed by Article 15 and Article 25 of the Constitution of India.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of India/Part III|article 15 of India Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NK2003"/&gt;{{sfn|Braun|2008|pp=913–924}} The book ''Sallekhana Is Not Suicide'' by former Justice [[T. K. Tukol]] was widely cited in the court&lt;ref name="NK2003"/&gt; which opined that "''Sallekhana'' as propounded in the Jaina scriptures is not suicide."{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=Preface}}

The [[Rajasthan High Court]] stated that "[The Constitution] does not permit nor include under Article 21 the right to take one's own life, nor can it include the right to take life as an essential religious practice under Article 25 of the Constitution". It further added that it is not established that ''Sallekhana'' is an essential practise of Jainism  and therefore not covered by Article 25 (1). So the High Court banned the practice in August 2015 making it punishable under Sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 309 (attempt to commit suicide).&lt;ref name="IBNlive 2015"&gt;{{citation |last=Vashishtha |first=Swati |title=Rajasthan HC bans starvation ritual 'Santhara', says fasting unto death not essential tenet of Jainism |work=News 18 |date=10 August 2015 |url=http://www.news18.com/news/india/rajasthan-hc-bans-starvation-ritual-santhara-says-fasting-unto-death-not-essential-tenet-of-jainism-1035893.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011060852/http://www.news18.com/news/india/rajasthan-hc-bans-starvation-ritual-santhara-says-fasting-unto-death-not-essential-tenet-of-jainism-1035893.html |archivedate=11 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Jain community held nationwide protest marches against the ban on ''Sallekhana''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |agency=Indo Asian News Service |url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/jain-community-protests-ban-religious-fast-death-154804860.html |title=Jain community protests ban on religious fast to death |date=24 August 2015 |work=[[Yahoo News]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016011023/https://in.news.yahoo.com/jain-community-protests-ban-religious-fast-death-154804860.html |archivedate=16 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ghatwai |first=Milind |last2=Singh |first2=Mahim Pratap |title=Jains protest against Santhara order |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/jains-protest-against-santhara-order |work=[[The Indian Express]] |date=25 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826144823/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/jains-protest-against-santhara-order/ |archivedate=26 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |agency=[[Press Trust of India]] |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/silent-march-by-jains-against-rajasthan-high-court-order-on-santhara/articleshow/48652929.cms |title=Silent march by Jains against Rajasthan High Court order on 'Santhara' |work=[[The Economic Times]] |date=24 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827025719/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/silent-march-by-jains-against-rajasthan-high-court-order-on-santhara/articleshow/48652929.cms |archivedate=27 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocate Suhrith Parthasarathy criticised the judgement of the High Court and wrote, "''Sallekhana'' is not an exercise in trying to achieve an unnatural death, but is rather a practice intrinsic to a person's ethical choice to live with dignity until death." He also pointed out that the Supreme Court in the ''Gian Kaur'' case explicitly recognises the right to live with human dignity within the ambit of right to life. He further cited that the Supreme Court wrote in the said case, "[The right to life] may include the right of a dying man to also die with dignity when his life is ebbing out. But the right to die with dignity at the end of life is not to be confused or equated with the right to die an unnatural death curtailing the natural span of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Parthasarathy |first=Suhrith |title=The flawed reasoning in the Santhara ban |url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-flawed-reasoning-in-the-santhara-ban/article7572183.ece |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=24 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114053258/http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-flawed-reasoning-in-the-santhara-ban/article7572183.ece |archivedate=14 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GK1"/&gt;

== In Hinduism and Buddhism ==
There are similar practices in other religions like [[Prayopavesa]] in [[Hinduism]],{{sfn|Timms|2016|p=167}} and [[Sokushinbutsu]] in [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Hayes|2016|p=16}}

The ancient and medieval scholars of Indian religions discussed suicide, and a person's right to voluntarily choose death. Suicide is broadly disapproved and discouraged by Buddhist, Hindu and Jaina texts.{{sfn|Arvind Sharma|1988|p=102}}{{sfn|Olivelle|2011|p=208 footnote 7}} The ''[[Satapatha Brahmana]]'' of Hinduism, for example, in section 10.2.6 discusses the nature of cyclic life and rebirth, and concludes that "therefore, one should not depart before one's natural lifespan", states David Brick, an Indologist at the Yale University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brick|first1=David|title=The Dharmasastric Debate on Widow Burning|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=April–June 2010|volume=130|issue=2|pages=203–223|jstor=23044515}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for those who have renounced the world ([[sannyasa|sannyasi]], sadhu, yati, bhikshu), the Indian texts discuss when ritual choice of death is appropriate and what means of voluntarily ending one's life are appropriate.{{sfn|Olivelle|2011|pp=207–229}} The ''[[Sannyasa Upanishads]]'', for example, discuss many methods of religious death, such as slowing then stopping consumption of foods and drinks to death (similar to ''sallekhana''), walking into a river and drowning, entering fire, path of the heroes, and the Great Journey.{{sfn|Olivelle|2011|pp=208–223}}{{refn|group=note|The heroic path is explained as dying in a [[Just war theory|just battle]] on the side of [[dharma]] (right, good), and equivalent. The Great Journey is walking north without eating till one dies of exhaustion.{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=134 footnote 18}} A similar practise known as ''Vadakirutthal'' (literally facing north) was prevalent in [[Sangam period]] in Tamilnadu. It is mentioned in Tamil anthologies such as in ''Puranaanooru''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

Scholars disagree whether "voluntary religious death" discussed in [[Indian religions]] is same as other forms of suicide.{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=134 footnote 18}}{{sfn|Olivelle|1978|pp=19–44}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sprockhoff | first=Joachim Friedrich | title=Die Alten im alten Indien Ein Versuch nach brahmanischen Quellen | journal=Saeculum | publisher=Bohlau Verlag | volume=30 | issue=4 | year=1979 | language=German| doi=10.7788/saeculum.1979.30.4.374 | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[logic]], the '''semantics of logic''' is the study of the [[semantics]], or [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s, of [[formal language|formal]] and (idealizations of) [[natural language]]s usually trying to capture the pre-theoretic notion of [[logical consequence|entailment]].

==Overview==
The truth conditions of various sentences we may encounter in [[argument]]s will depend upon their meaning, and so logicians cannot completely avoid the need to provide some treatment of the meaning of these sentences.  The semantics of logic refers to the approaches that logicians have introduced to understand and determine that part of meaning in which they are interested; the logician traditionally is not interested in the sentence as uttered but in the [[proposition]], an idealised sentence suitable for logical manipulation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Until the advent of modern logic, [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Organon]]'', especially ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', provided the basis for understanding the significance of logic.  The introduction of [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]], needed to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]], rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that governed Aristotle's account, although there is a renewed interest in [[term logic]], attempting to find calculi in the spirit of Aristotle's syllogistic but with the generality of modern logics based on the quantifier.

The main modern approaches to semantics for formal languages are the following:
* '''Model-theoretic semantics''' is the archetype of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[semantic theory of truth]], based on his [[T-schema]], and is one of the founding concepts of [[model theory]].  This is the most widespread approach, and is based on the idea that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of interpretation functions from them to some predefined mathematical domains: an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of [[first-order predicate logic]] is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of [[individual]]s, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values "true" and "false".  Model-theoretic semantics provides the foundations for an approach to the theory of meaning known as [[Truth-conditional semantics]], which was pioneered by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]].  [[Kripke semantics]] introduces innovations, but is broadly in the Tarskian mold.
* '''[[Proof-theoretic semantics]]''' associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences. [[Gerhard Gentzen]], [[Dag Prawitz]] and [[Michael Dummett]] are generally seen as the founders of this approach; it is heavily influenced by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy, especially his aphorism "meaning is use".
* '''[[Truth-value semantics]]''' (also commonly referred to as ''substitutional quantification'') was advocated by [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]] for modal logics in the early 1960s and later championed by Dunn, Belnap, and Leblanc for standard first-order logic. [[James Garson]] has given some results in the areas of adequacy for [[intensional logic]]s outfitted with such a semantics. The truth conditions for quantified formulas are given purely in terms of truth with no appeal to domains whatsoever (and hence its name ''truth-value semantics'').
* '''[[Game semantics|Game-theoretical semantics]]''' has made a resurgence lately mainly due to [[Jaakko Hintikka]] for logics of (finite) partially ordered quantification which were originally investigated by [[Leon Henkin]], who studied [[Henkin quantifier]]s.
* '''[[Probabilistic semantics]]''' originated from H. Field and has been shown equivalent to and a natural generalization of truth-value semantics. Like truth-value semantics, it is also non-referential in nature.

'''Seto''' (''seto kiil´'';&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Seto+language%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search Seto language @ google scholar]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-et|setu keel}}) is a dialect of [[South Estonian]] spoken by 12,549 people.&lt;ref name="Statistikaamet" /&gt; It is sometimes identified as a dialect of [[Võro language|Võro]], or the two are described as one language, Seto-Võro. However, the ethnic identity of [[Setos]] (''Setokõsõq'') and [[Võros]] (''Võrokõsõq'') is quite distinct; Setos mostly inhabit the area near [[Estonia]]'s southeastern border with [[Russia]] in [[Setomaa]], and are primarily [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], while Võros are traditionally [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and live in [[Võru County]].

== Incidence and prevalence of schizophrenia ==
For both men and women, [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of schizophrenia onset peaks at multiple points across the lifespan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For men, the highest frequency of incidence onset occurs in the early twenties and there is evidence of a second peak in the mid-thirties. For women, there is a similar pattern with peaks in the early twenties and middle age.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=Richard J.|last2=Addington|first2=Jean|last3=Viswanathan|first3=Ananth C.|last4=Lewis|first4=Shôn W.|last5=Cotter|first5=Jack|last6=Yung|first6=Alison R.|last7=Abel|first7=Kathryn M.|date=2016-02-16|title=How Age and Gender Predict Illness Course in a First-Episode Nonaffective Psychosis Cohort|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4088/jcp.14m09369|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|pages=e283–e289|doi=10.4088/jcp.14m09369|issn=0160-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also demonstrated a tertiary peak for women in the early sixties. Men have higher frequency rates of onset than women from the early twenties to middle age, and women have higher frequency rates of onset starting in late middle age. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castle|first=David J.|last2=Wessely|first2=Simon|last3=Murray|first3=Robin M.|date=May 1993|title=Sex and Schizophrenia: Effects of Diagnostic Stringency, and Associations with Premorbid Variables|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjp.162.5.658|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=162|issue=05|pages=658–664|doi=10.1192/bjp.162.5.658|issn=0007-1250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies of [[prevalence]] rates of schizophrenia estimate that the lifetime likelihood of developing the disorder is 0.3%-0.7%, and did not find evidence of sex differences. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGrath|first=J.|last2=Saha|first2=S.|last3=Chant|first3=D.|last4=Welham|first4=J.|date=2008-05-14|title=Schizophrenia: A Concise Overview of Incidence, Prevalence, and Mortality|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/epirev/mxn001|journal=Epidemiologic Reviews|volume=30|issue=1|pages=67–76|doi=10.1093/epirev/mxn001|issn=0193-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saha|first=Sukanta|last2=Chant|first2=David|last3=Welham|first3=Joy|last4=McGrath|first4=John|date=2005-05-31|title=A Systematic Review of the Prevalence of Schizophrenia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020141|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=2|issue=5|pages=e141|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020141|issn=1549-1676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical presentation ==
Symptom expression systematically differs between men and women. Women are more likely to experience high levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., low mood, [[anhedonia]], fatigue) at illness onset and over the course of illness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Men are more likely to experience more [[Negative symptom|negative symptoms]] than women at illness onset. There is conflicting evidence related to sex differences in the expression of [[positive symptoms]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some studies have found that women are more likely to experience positive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Jill M.|last2=Link|first2=Bruce G.|date=1988-01|title=Gender and the expression of schizophrenia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-3956(88)90078-7|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=22|issue=2|pages=141–155|doi=10.1016/0022-3956(88)90078-7|issn=0022-3956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=C.Z.|last2=Wu Qianjin|date=1994-02|title=Popula tion Aging in China: The Demographic Implications|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000944559403000103|journal=China Report|volume=30|issue=1|pages=29–51|doi=10.1177/000944559403000103|issn=0009-4455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found no significant sex differences in the expression of positive symptoms.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Vera A.|last2=Castle|first2=David J.|last3=Jablensky|first3=Assen V.|date=2008-01|title=Do Women Express and Experience Psychosis Differently from Men?

== Course of illness and treatment outcomes ==
Age at illness onset likely contributes to observed sex differences in course of illness and treatment outcomes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Increased negative and [[Schizophrenia|cognitive symptoms]] and poorer overall treatment outcomes are both related to younger age at onset, while fewer negative and cognitive symptoms are associated with older age at onset.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Linda S.|last2=Harrow|first2=Martin|last3=Rosen|first3=Cherise|last4=Faull|first4=Robert|last5=Strauss|first5=Gregory P.|date=2008-11|title=Sex differences in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders: a 20-year longitudinal study of psychosis and recovery|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2008.03.004|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|volume=49|issue=6|pages=523–529|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2008.03.004|issn=0010-440X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are consistent with the differences patterns of symptom expression observed in men and women and the relative age of onset for each gender. Men are more likely to experience poorer overall outcomes than women because of the relationship between younger age at onset and symptom severity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Clinical trials examining sex differences in the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic medications found greater rates of symptom reduction in women compared to men.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, women are at a greater risk for experiencing weight gain and developing [[metabolic syndrome]] as a result of antipsychotic medication use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goff|first=Donald C.|last2=Sullivan|first2=Lisa M.|last3=McEvoy|first3=Joseph P.|last4=Meyer|first4=Jonathan M.|last5=Nasrallah|first5=Henry A.|last6=Daumit|first6=Gail L.|last7=Lamberti|first7=Steven|last8=D'Agostino|first8=Ralph B.|last9=Stroup|first9=Thomas S.|date=2005-12|title=A comparison of ten-year cardiac risk estimates in schizophrenia patients from the CATIE study and matched controls|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2005.08.010|journal=Schizophrenia Research|volume=80|issue=1|pages=45–53|doi=10.1016/j.schres.2005.08.010|issn=0920-9964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The steroids and hormones associated with [[Sexual differentiation|sex differentiation]] during [[Prenatal development|fetal development]] have critical effects on neuronal development in humans, and there is evidence that these hormones have implications for sex differences in brain abnormalities observed in adults with schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] studies have revealed more severe brain damage in men diagnosed with schizophrenia than women.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1995-05|title=Effects of diagnosis, laterality, and gender on brain morphology in schizophrenia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1176/ajp.152.5.704|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=152|issue=5|pages=704–714|doi=10.1176/ajp.152.5.704|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, larger lateral and third ventricles and reduced volumes of critical regions such as the [[hippocampus]], [[amygdala]], and [[Prefrontal lobe|prefrontal]] cortical regions have been observed in men.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These brain abnormalities likely contribute to the observed short-term and long-term memory deficits in men diagnosed with schizophrenia. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Han|first1=M.|last2=Huang|first2=X.

=== Social and environmental factors ===

==== Social cognition and social functioning ====
Premorbid [[Social skills|social functioning]] and [[social cognition]], robust predictors of relapse in this population, differ significantly between men and women.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritsner|first=Michael S.|last2=Arbitman|first2=Marina|last3=Lisker|first3=Alexander|last4=Ponizovsky|first4=Alexander M.|date=2011-10-02|title=Ten-year quality of life outcomes among patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder II.

==== Substance abuse and dependence ====
Substance abuse is also highly correlated with poorer functional outcomes and can significantly influence the course of illness.

'''Skin whitening''' is the use of substances, mixtures, or physical treatments to lighten skin color. Sometimes, the terms "lightening", "brightening", "depigmentation" and "bleaching" are also used. Skin whitening treatments work by reducing the skin's [[melanin]] content. Many agents have been shown to be effective in skin whitening. Some agents have beneficial side effect including: antioxidants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Hesperidin, A Popular Antioxidant Inhibits Melanogenesis via Erk1/2 Mediated MITF Degradation| last1=Lee| first1=Heun Joo| last2=Lee| first2=Woo Jin| last3=Chang| first3=Sung Eun| last4=Lee| first4=Ga-Young| year=2015| journal=Int.

Other agents are a significant risk to health, such as [[Mercury poisoning|mercury]]-based methods.

==Uses==
Specific zones of [[hyperpigmentation]] such as [[lentigo]] spots, [[mole (skin marking)|moles]], and [[birthmark]]s may be depigmented to match the surrounding skin. In cases of [[vitiligo]] unaffected skin may be lightened to achieve a more uniform appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cosmetic-treatments/skin-lightening/?|title=Skin lightening|website=nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms of action==

[[Melanin]] is the main substance responsible for the color of the skin. Melanin is class of dark [[polymer]]s generated by the body through the process of [[melanogenesis]]. Among the melanin pigmenting the skin and hair, two types can be distinguished based on its chemical composition and biological route of synthesis: the black/brown [[eumelanin]] and the red/yellow [[pheomelanin]]. The variation of [[skin color]] among individuals is mostly because of variation of the content of melanin in the skin. Skin with little or no melanin is [[white skin|almost white]]. Other factors influence skin color in a lesser degree, including the amount of blood in blood vessels (because of the color of blood), skin thickness and content of [[carotenoid]]s in skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=You Are What You Eat: Within-Subject Increases in Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Confer Beneficial Skin-Color Changes|last1=Whitehead|first1=Ross D.|last2=Re|first2=Daniel|last3=Xiao|first3=Dengke|last4=Ozakinci|first4=Gozde|last5=Perrett|first5=David I.|year=2012|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=3|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032988|pmc=3296758|pmid=22412966|pages=e32988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fruit, Vegetable and Dietary Carotenoid Intakes Explain Variation in Skin-Color in Young Caucasian Women: a Cross-Sectional Study|last1=Pezdirc|first1=Kristine|last2=Hutchesson|first2=Melinda J.|last3=Whitehead

Melanin in synthesized in [[melanosomes]] which are organelles produced in [[melanocytes]]. Melanocytes are cells dedicated to this function that are present in the skin, hair follicles, and other structures of the body. The synthesis of melanin (also called "melanogenesis" and "melanization") involves a chain of enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions and non-enzyme-catalyzed reactions.{{refn| group=notes| name=Melanin synthesis| The chemical pathways of the synthesis of melanin has been described by many papers; however, it is often oversimplified. The following references are suggested: Kondo, Hearing (2011),{{r|Kondo2011}} Chang (2009){{r|Chang2009}} and Slominski et al. (2004).{{r|Slominski2004}}}} The main precursor to melanin is [[tyrosine|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-tyrosine]]. The first step of melanogenesis is the conversion of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-tyrosine to [[L-DOPA|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-DOPA]]; this is the first and rate-limiting step and is catalyzed by the enzyme [[tyrosinase]] (TYR).{{r|Slominski2004|p=1163}} Other enzymes involved in the synthesis include [[tyrosinase-related protein 1]] (TRP1) and [[tyrosinase-related protein 2]] (TRP2); TRP2 is also known as "dopachrome tautomerase" (DCT). &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-tyrosine is taken by the melanocytes from the intercellular medium, then transported to the melanosomes. &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-tyrosine is also synthesized within the melanocytes from [[phenylalanine|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine]] by the enzyme [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]] (PAH).{{r|Slominski2004|p=1164}}

Melanosomes are transferred to [[keratinocyte]]s (the most abundant cell type in the skin). Most of the melanin of skin is found in keratinocytes. Additionally, melanocytes interact with keratinocytes through chemical signaling. See [[#Preventing the transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes|§ Preventing the transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes]].

Skin whitening agents work by reducing the presence of melanin in the skin. To accomplish this, there are several possible mechanism of actions:{{refn|group=notes|"In addition to inhibition of tyrosinase catalytic activity, other approaches to treat hyperpigmentation include inhibition of tyrosinase mRNA transcription, aberration of tyrosinase glycosylation and maturation, acceleration of tyrosinase degradation, interference with melanosome maturation and transfer, inhibition of inflammation-induced melanogenic response, and acceleration of skin turnover. Accordingly, a huge number of depigmenting agents or whitening agents developed by those alternative approaches have been successfully identified and deeply reviewed in many articles [''references omitted'']."{{r|Chang2009}}}}{{r|Ebanks2009}}
*[[#Inhibition of the activity of tyrosinase|Inhibition of the activity of tyrosinase]]: The catalytic action of tyrosinase is inhibited (slowed or nearly stopped) by the skin whitening agent.
*Inhibition of the expression or activation of tyrosinase: The antimelanogenic agent causes that less tyrosinase is generated or that tyrosinase is not activated to its functional form.
*Scavenging of the intermediate products of melanin synthesis.

===Inhibition of the activity of tyrosinase===
{{further|enzyme inhibitor}}

Many tyrosinase inhibitors have been discovered or developed.  Many inhibitors of tyrosinase are known; most are of the reversible type.{{refn|group=notes|"In contrast to the huge number of reversible inhibitors has been identified, rarely irreversible inhibitors of tyrosinase were found until now. These irreversible inhibitors, which are also called specific inactivators, can form irreversibly covalent bond with the target enzyme and then inactivate it."{{r|Chang2009}}}} For a review of tyrosinase inhibitors see Chang (2009).&lt;ref name=Chang2009 /&gt; Reviews of patents on tyrosinase inhibitors have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Tyrosinase inhibitors: a patent review (2011-2015)| url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sultan_Ullah/publication/292142798_Tyrosinase_inhibitors_A_patent_review_2011-2015/links/56e9030308aea51e7f3b6d39.pdf| year=2016| author=Ullah, Sultan| display-authors=etal| journal=Expert.

Evaluation of effectivity:{{refn|group=notes|"Inhibitor strength is usually expressed as the inhibitory IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value, which is the concentration of an inhibitor needed to inhibit half of the enzyme activity in the tested condition. However, for the tyrosinase inhibitors in the literature, the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values are incomparable due to the varied assay conditions, including different substrate concentrations, varied incubation time, and different batches of commercial tyrosinase. Fortunately, in most studies conducted to discover new tyrosinase inhibitors, a well-known tyrosinase inhibitor such as kojic acid is often used as a positive standard at the same time. Hence, in order to compare the inhibitors described in different literature in a more practical manner, a relative inhibitory activity (RA), which is calculated by dividing the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of kojic acid with that of a newly found inhibitor in the same report, is used to express and compare the inhibitory strength of an inhibitor with others in this review."{{r|Chang2009}}}} The potency (how little of a substance is needed to achieve an effect) of ''reversible'' inhibitors is usually given in terms of its [[IC50|IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is highly dependent on the assay conditions, making it incomparable among different assays (unless designed to be comparable). It is customary practice in studies of tyrosinase inhibitors to assay one or several well known inhibitors as a positive control and point of comparison. The ''relative activity'' (RA) of a compound under investigation is its activity divided by the activity of the positive control; in turn the ''activity'' of a compound is usually defined as 1/IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. The RA is less dependent on assay conditions that the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and is suitable to compare the results of different assays provided the same positive control was used. The positive control is commonly [[#Kojic acid|kojic acid]].

Upregulation of tyrosinase caused by tyrosinase inhibitors: Several skin whitening agents including some which are tyrosinase inhibitors have been found to cause an ''increase'' in the expression of tyrosinase (which by itself would increase melanin synthesis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Examining the Impact of Skin Lighteners In Vitro| last1=Gruber| first1=James V.| last2=Holtz| first2=Robert| year=2013| journal=Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity| doi=10.1155/2013/702120| pmc=3655678| pmid=23738040| volume=2013| pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Chang2012}}

===Inhibition of the expression or activation of tyrosinase===
{{see also|transcription factor|hormone|receptor (biochemistry)}}
[[Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor]] (MITF) is the master [[transcription factor]] that controls the expression of TYR, TRP1 and TRP2, [[MART1]], [[PMEL17]] and many other important proteins involved in the function of melanocytes.{{refn|group=notes|name=MITF|"The transcriptional level is the first stage by which the expression of tyrosinase and related melanogenic enzymes may be modulated. Influential in this process, the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor that regulates melanocyte cellular differentiation as well as the transcription of melanogenic enzymes (tyrosinase, TYRP1 and TYRP2) and melanosome structural proteins (MART-1 and PMEL17) [''references omitted'']."{{r|Ebanks2009}}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"In addition to being involved in the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of melanocytes, MITF is the master regulator of melanogenesis in melanocytes via binding to the M box of a promoter region and regulating the gene expression of tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2 [''references omitted''].

====The MC1R receptor and cAMP====
The [[melanocortin 1 receptor]] (MC1R) is a [[transmembrane receptor|transmembrane]] and [[G-protein coupled receptor|G-protein coupled]] receptor expressed in melanocytes. MC1R is an important target for the regulation of melanogenesis.{{r|Chen2014}}{{r|Rodríguez2014}}{{r|Yamaguchi2009}} [[Agonist|Agonism]] (i.e.: activation) of MC1R increases the ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin and increases the generation of melanin overall.

MC1R/cAMP signaling pathway:{{r|group=notes|Signaling pathways}}{{r|group=notes|MC1R}}{{r|Chen2014}}{{r|Rodríguez2014}}{{r|Lee2013}} Activation of MC1R causes activation of [[adenylyl cyclase]] (AC), which produces [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP), which activates [[protein kinase A]] (PKA), which activates (by [[protein phosphorylation]]) [[cAMP response element-binding protein]] (CREB), which upregulates MITF (CREB is a transcription factor of MITF). Whitening agents that interfere with the MC1R/cAMP signaling pathway have been reviewed by Chang (2012).{{r|Chang2012}}

cAMP is degraded by [[phosphodiesterase]]s (PDE). The PDE5 inhibitors [[sildenafil]] and [[vardenafil]], the cAMP-promoter [[IBMX]] and [[8-CPT-cGMP]] (a [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate]] (cGMP) analogue) increase melanin synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=PDE5 inhibitor promotes melanin synthesis through the PKG pathway in B16 melanoma cells| author=Zhang, Xiaodong| display-authors=etal| year=2012| journal=J.

MC1R ligands: [[alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone]] (α-MSH),{{refn|group=notes|name=MC1R|"Alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), a peptide derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC), regulates melanogenesis ''via'' a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent pathway [''references omitted'']. When binding to its receptor, melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R), on the membrane of melanocytes, the hormone activates adenylate cyclase (AC) to produce cAMP as an intracellular second message ''via'' a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-type activation. cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which then activates the gene expression of MITF ''via'' phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Finally, MITF efficiently activates the melanogenesis-related enzymes and stimulates melanogenesis. Once α-MSH binds to MC1R, up to a 100-fold increase in melanogenesis attends. In addition to α-MSH, other POMC-derived peptides, such as β-MSH and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), also stimulate melanogenesis ''via'' the same pathway."{{r|Chang2012}}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"α-MSH binding to melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) on melanocytes in the basal epidermis generates the second messenger cAMP via interactions between MC1R and adenylyl cyclase, and leads to activation of protein kinase A and the cAMP responsive binding element (CREB) and microphthalmia (Mitf) transcription factors. CREB and Mitf directly enhance melanin production by raising levels of tyrosinase and other melanin biosynthetic enzymes. Thus, MSH-MC1R signaling leads to enhanced pigment synthesis by melanocytes and accumulation of melanin by epidermal keratinocytes.&lt;br /&gt;[''etcetera'']&lt;br /&gt;The MC1R is found on the surface of melanocytes where it binds to α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) and transmits differentiation signals into the cell through activation of adenylyl cyclase and generation of cAMP [''references omitted'']. cAMP signaling leads to activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) cascade which, in turn, leads to increased levels and/or activity of many melanogenic enzymes to enhance production and export of melanin by melanocytes [''references and figure omitted'']."{{r|D'Orazio2013}}}} [[beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone]] (β-MSH) and [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] are endogenous [[agonist]]s of MC1R.{{r|Slominski2004|p=1175}} [[Agouti signaling protein]] (ASIP) appears to be the only endogenous [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of MC1R.{{refn|group=notes|The assertion that ASIP is the only endogenous antagonist is found in Yamaguchi, Hearing (2009).{{r|Yamaguchi2009}}}} Synthetic MC1R agonists have been designed; examples include the peptides [[afamelanotide]] and [[melanotan II]].{{r|Chen2014}}

===Preventing the transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes===
{{see also|human skin#Structure|epidermis}}
Keratinocytes in the skin: Within the skin, melanocytes are present in the basal layer of the [[epidermis]]; from these melanocytes originate dendrites that reach [[keratinocytes]].{{refn|group=notes|name=Keratinocytes|"In the skin, melanocytes are situated on the basal layer which separates dermis and epidermis. One melanocyte is surrounded by approximately 36 keratinocytes. Together, they form the so-called epidermal melanin unit. The melanin produced and stored inside the melanocyte in the melanosomal compartment is transported via dendrites to the overlaying keratinocytes."{{r|Smit2009}}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Each melanocyte resides in the basal epithelial layer and, by virtue of its dendrites, interacts with approximately 36 keratinocytes to transfer melanosomes and protect the skin from photo-induced carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the amount and type of melanin produced and transferred to the keratinocytes with subsequent incorporation, aggregation and degradation influences skin complexion coloration [''reference omitted'']."{{r|Ebanks2009}}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wu, Hammer (2014) describe the number of keratinocytes per melanocyte as above 40.{{r|Wu2014}}}} Keratinocytes are the most abundant cell type in the epidermis.{{refn|group=notes|"Keratinocytes are the most abundant cells in the epidermis and are characterized by their expression of cytokeratins and formation of desmosomes and tight junctions with each other to form an effective physicochemical barrier."{{r|D'Orazio2013}}}} In the skin, there are approximately 36 keratinocytes per melanocyte.{{r|group=notes|Keratinocytes}} Keratinocytes are continuously generated in the basal layer of the epidermis and displace older keratinocytes of the skin towards the surface.

===Directly destroying existing melanin===
Several species of fungi produce enzymes that reduce pigmentation by degrading melanin.&lt;ref name=Nagasaki2008&gt;{{cite journal| title=Purification, characterization, and gene cloning of Ceriporiopsis sp. strain MD-1 peroxidases that decolorize human hair melanin| last1=Nagasaki| first1=Kenji| last2=Kumazawa| first2=Masaro| last3=Murakami| first3=Shuichiro| last4=Takenaka| first4=Shinji| last5=Koike| first5=Kenzo| last6=Aoki| first6=Kenji| year=2008| journal=Appl.

===Non-pharmacological treatments===
Most skin-lightening treatments, which can reduce or block some amount of melanin production, are aimed at inhibiting [[tyrosinase]]. Many treatments use a combination of topical lotions or gels containing melanin-inhibiting ingredients along with a sunscreen, and a prescription [[retinoid]]. Depending on how the skin responds to these treatments, [[exfoliant]]s ‒either in the form of topical cosmetic or chemical peels‒ and [[laser]]s may be used. New development using [[LED]] systems are also showing good results.&lt;ref name="Rendon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DermatologicSurgery2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Drugs in Dermatology|year=2004|pages=27–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|year=2003|pages=966–972|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2003.02017.x|volume=42|issue=12|title=Safety and efficacy of 4% hydroquinone combined with 10% glycolic acid, antioxidants, and sunscreen in the treatment of melasma|last1=Guevara|first1=Ian L|last2=Pandya|first2=Amit G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Archives of Dermatology|date=December 2002|pages=1578–1582|doi=10.1001/archderm.138.12.1578|volume=138|issue=12|title=Efficacy of Glycolic Acid Peels in the Treatment of Melasma|last1=Hurley|first1=Mary E|last2=Guevara|first2=Ian L|last3=Gonzales|first3=Rose Mary|last4=Pandya|first4=Amit G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Whitening agents==

===Pre-melanin synthesis===

===During melanin synthesis===

====Hydroquinone====
{{Main|Hydroquinone}}

In medical literature, hydroquinone is considered the primary topical ingredient for inhibiting melanin production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Cutis|date=March 2006|pages=177–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Drugs in Dermatology|date=September–October 2005|pages=592–597}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Cosmetic Science|date=May–June 1998|pages=208–290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Dermatological Surgery|date=May 1996|pages=443–447|doi= 10.1016/1076-0512(96)00065-9|volume=22|last1=Garcia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its components have potent antioxidant abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Natural Products|date=November 2002|pages=1605–1611|doi=10.1021/np020128p|volume=65|issue=11|title=New Antioxidant Hydroquinone Derivatives from the Algicolous Marine Fungus Acremonium sp|last1=Abdel-Lateff|first1=Ahmed|last2=König|first2=Gabriele M|last3=Fisch|first3=Katja M|last4=Höller|first4=Ulrich|last5=Jones|first5=Peter G|last6=Wright|first6=Anthony D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Topical [[hydroquinone]] comes in 2% (available in cosmetics, often as [[monobenzone]]) to 4% (or more) concentrations (available from a physician or by prescription), alone or in combination with [[tretinoin]] 0.05% to 0.1%. Research has shown hydroquinone and tretinoin to prevent sun- or hormone-induced [[melasma]].&lt;ref name="DermatologicSurgery2006" /&gt;

Hydroquinone is a strong inhibitor of melanin production, meaning that it prevents dark skin from making the substance responsible for skin color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Dermatological Science|date=August 2001|pages=68–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydroquinone does not bleach the skin but lightens it, and can only disrupt the synthesis and production of melanin [[hyperpigmentation]]. It has been banned in some European countries (e.g. [[France]]) because of fears of a cancer risk. However, other European countries (e.g. [[Spain]]) have both prescription and nonprescription formulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listado de medicamentos que contienen HIDROQUINONA|url=https://www.vademecum.es/medicamentos-principio-activo-hidroquinona_4475_1|website=Vademecum.es|accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some concerns about hydroquinone's safety on skin have been expressed, but the research when it comes to topical application indicates negative reactions are minor or a result of using extremely high concentrations or from other skin-lightening agents such as [[glucocorticoid]]s or [[mercury iodine]]. Any perceived risk is most likely applicable for African women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=British Journal of Dermatology|date=March 2003|pages=493–500|doi= 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05161.x|pmid=12653741|volume=148|issue=3|title=Skin diseases associated with the cosmetic use of bleaching products in women from Dakar, Senegal|last1=Mahe|first1=A|last2=Ly|first2=F|last3=Aymard|first3=G|last4=Dangou|first4=J.M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hydroquinone has been shown to cause [[leukemia]] in mice and other animals. The European Union banned it from cosmetics in 2001, but it shows up in bootleg creams in the developing world. It is sold in the United States as an over-the-counter drug, but with a concentration of hydroquinone not exceeding 2 percent.

Because of hydroquinone's action on the skin, it can be an irritant, particularly in higher concentrations of 4% or greater and predictably when combined with tretinoin. Some medications have been created that combine 4% hydroquinone with tretinoin and a form of [[cortisone]]. The cortisone is included as an [[anti-inflammatory]]. The negative side effect of repeated application of cortisone is countered by the positive effect of the tretinoin so that it does not cause thinning of skin and damage to collagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Drugs in Dermatology|date=July–August 2004|pages=377–381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resorcinol====
{{Main|Resorcinol}}
Resorcinol or m-hydroquinone is often used in skin-lightener cosmetics in countries where free hydroquinone is prohibited.

====Arbutin====
Some of alternative lighteners are derived from natural sources of hydroquinone. These include ''[[Mitracarpus scaber]]'' extract, ''Uva ursi'' ([[bearberry]]) extract, ''Morus bombycis'' ([[mulberry]]), ''Morus alba'' ([[white mulberry]]), and ''Broussonetia papyrifera'' ([[paper mulberry]]). All of these contain [[arbutin]] (technically known as hydroquinone-β-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucoside), which can inhibit melanin production. Pure forms of arbutin are considered more potent for affecting skin lightening.

Arbutin is derived from the leaves of [[bearberry]], [[cranberry]], [[mulberry]] or [[blueberry|blueberry shrubs]], and also is present in most types of [[pear]]s. It can have [[melanin]]-inhibiting properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | year = 1996 | pages = 765–769 | title = Arbutin: mechanism of its depigmenting action in human melanocyte culture | volume = 276 | pmid = 8632348 | last1 = Maeda | first1 = K | last2 = Fukuda | first2 = M | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbutin and other plant extracts are considered safe alternatives to commonly used [[depigmenting agents]] to make the skin fairer. Medical studies have shown the efficiency of arbutin for skin lightening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10529-007-9605-1 | title = Inhibitory effects of arbutin-β-glycosides synthesized from enzymatic transglycosylation for melanogenesis | year = 2007 | last1 = Jun | first1 = So-Young | last2 = Park | first2 = Kyung-Min | last3 = Choi | first3 = Ki-Won | last4 = Jang | first4 = Min Kyung | last5 = Kang | first5 = Hwan Yul | last6 = Lee | first6 = Sang-Hyeon | last7 = Park | first7 = Kwan-Hwa | last8 = Cha | first8 = Jaeho | journal = Biotechnology Letters | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 743–8 | pmid = 18040603}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2013}} There are patents controlling its use for skin lightening.  Arbutin actually exists in two isomers, alpha and beta. The alpha isomer offers higher stability over the beta isomer and is the preferred form for skin lightening indications.

====Kojic acid====
[[Kojic acid]] is a by-product in the fermentation process of malting rice for use in the manufacturing of [[sake]], the Japanese rice wine. Some research shows kojic acid to be effective for inhibiting melanin production.&lt;ref&gt;''Archives of Pharmacal Research'', August 2001, pages 307–311.&lt;/ref&gt; However, kojic acid is an unstable ingredient in cosmetic formulations. Upon exposure to air or sunlight it can turn brown and lose its efficacy. Many cosmetic companies use kojic dipalmitate as an alternative because it is more stable in formulations. However, there is no research showing kojic dipalmitate to be as effective as kojic acid, although it is a good antioxidant. Further, some controversial research has suggested that kojic acid may have [[carcinogenic]] properties in large doses.&lt;ref&gt;''Mutation Research, Genetic Toxicology and Environmental Mutagenesis'', June 2005, pages 133–1450 and ''[[Toxicological Sciences]]'', September 2004, pages 43–49.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other further studies show that kojic acid is not carcinogenic, but can cause [[allergic contact dermatitis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Serra-Baldrich | first1 = E. | last2 = Tribô | first2 = M.

====Azelaic acid====
[[Azelaic acid]] is a component of grains, such as [[wheat]], [[rye]], and [[barley]]. It is applied topically in a cream formulation at a 10–20% concentration. Azelaic acid is used to treat [[acne]], but there also is research showing it to be effective for skin discolorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baliña|first=Luis M.|author2=Graupe, Klaus |title=The Treatment of Melasma 20% Azelaic Acid versus 4% Hydroquinone Cream|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|date=December 1991|volume=30|issue=12|pages=893–895|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4362.1991.tb04362.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research also indicates azelaic acid may be an option for inhibiting melanin production.&lt;ref name="Rendon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rendon|first=Marta|author2=Berneburg, Mark |author3=Arellano, Ivonne |author4= Picardo, Mauro |title=Treatment of melasma|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|date=May 2006|series=Supplement 2|volume=54|issue=5|pages=S272–S281|doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2005.12.039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vitamin C====
[[Vitamin C]] and its various forms ([[ascorbic acid]], magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, etc.) are considered an effective antioxidant for the skin and help to lighten skin.{{medcn|date=December 2013}} One study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid= 8317379 | year= 1993 | last1= Johnston | first1= CS | last2= Meyer | first2= CG | last3= Srilakshmi | first3= JC | title= Vitamin C elevates red blood cell glutathione in healthy adults | volume= 58 | issue= 1 | pages=103–5 | journal= The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition }}&lt;/ref&gt; found it raises [[glutathione]] levels in the body. Another study found that brownish guinea pigs given vitamin C, [[vitamin E]] and [[L-cysteine]], simultaneously, led to lighter skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/biof.552210182 | title = Effect of simultaneous administration of vitamin C, L-cysteine and vitamin E on the melanogenesis | year = 2004 | last1 = Fujiwara | first1 = Yoko | last2 = Sahashi | first2 = Yumiko | last3 = Aritro | first3 = Mitsumi | last4 = Hasegawa | first4 = Satoko | last5 = Akimoto | first5 = Koji | last6 = Ninomiya | first6 = Shinji | last7 = Sakaguchi | first7 = Yasue | last8 = Seyama | first8 = Yousuke | journal = BioFactors | volume = 21 | pages = 415–8 | pmid = 15630239 | issue = 1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Glutathione====
[[Glutathione]] is a tripeptide molecule found in mammalian bodies. It is an [[antioxidant]] that plays an important role in preventing [[oxidative damage]] to the skin. In addition to its many recognized biological functions, glutathione has also been associated with skin lightening ability. While skin whitening reduces melanin which serves as the natural protection from UV exposure, glutathione's antioxidant property also protects the skin from UV radiation .

A double-blind placebo-controlled study found glutathione to be effective as a skin whitening agent and in reducing dark spots; the dose regime was 500&amp;nbsp;mg per day (split in 2 equal doses per day) for 2–4 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Glutathione as an oral whitening agent: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study| last1=Arjinpathana| first1=Nutthavuth| last2=Asawanonda| first2=Pravit| year=2012| journal=J.

Glutathione is an ingredient in some cosmetics preparations. [https://thehealthbase.com/glutathione-skin-whitening-soap/ Glutathione for skin whitening] is available in cream, soap, lotion, nasal spray and injectable form. Glutathione that is applied on the skin in the form of lotion is not efficiently absorbed by the skin cells as the [[thiol group]] undergoes rapid formation of disulfide. When taken orally, glutathione is hydrolyzed by enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract resulting in reduced bioavailability. The level of glutathione increased in smalls amounts temporarily when large oral doses were administered.&lt;ref name="pmid1362956"&gt;{{cite journal| title=The systemic availability of oral glutathione| author1=Witschi| first1=A.| last2=Reddy| first2=S.| last3=Stofer| first3=B.| last4=Lauterburg| first4=B. H.| year=1992| journal=European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology| volume=43| issue=6| doi=10.1007/BF02284971| pmid=1362956| pages=667–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the effectiveness of externally administered glutathione is slowed down by its inability to cross cell membranes efficiently and its rapid degradation by enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract. On the contrary, intravenous glutathione delivers very high doses directly into the systemic circulation and is the preferred mode of administering glutathione. However, this method of administrating the antioxidant might flood the cells with glutathione that may cause [[reductive stress]]. This might expose people to potential health risks associated with long-term use of high dose of glutathione. Of all the glutathione products, glutathione tablet remains the most effective type.

Glutathione can be combined with many other agents like vitamin C to increase its absorption, [[N-acetyl cysteine]] to boost its level, and other antioxidants like vitamin E. Some oral intake of glutathione could have dangerous effect when combined with other skin whitening agents such as hydroquinone which is a carcinogenic element and [[monobenzone]] which causes irreversible [[depigmentation]].

===Post-melanin synthesis===

====Alpha hydroxy acids====
[[Alpha hydroxy acid]]s (AHAs){{snd}} primarily in the form of [[lactic acid]] and [[glycolic acid]]{{snd}} are the most researched forms of AHAs because they have a molecular size that allows effective penetration into the top layers of skin. It is generally assumed that in and of themselves AHAs in concentrations of 4% to 15% are not effective for inhibiting melanin production and will not lighten skin discolorations in that manner. It is believed that their benefit is in helping cell turnover rates and removing unhealthy or abnormal layers of superficial skin cells (exfoliation) where hyperpigmented cells can accumulate. However, other research has shown that lactic and glycolic acids can indeed inhibit melanin production separate from their actions as an exfoliant on skin.&lt;ref&gt;''Experimental Dermatology'', January 2003, supplemental. pages 43–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chemical peel#Alpha hydroxy acid peels|Alpha hydroxy acid peels]] (using 50% concentrations or greater) may remove skin discolorations. Only a qualified physician should perform these types of facial peels.&lt;ref&gt;''Dermatologic Surgery'', February 2005, pages 149–154; ''Journal of Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery'', April 2004, pages 97–102; ''Cutis'', February 2004, supplemental, pages 18–24; ''Dermatologic Therapy'', June 2004, pages 196–205; and ''Dermatological Surgery'', June 1999, pages 450–454.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other/ungrouped===

====Depigmenting agents====
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Most commonly, [[depigmentation]] of the skin is linked to people born with [[vitiligo]], which produces differing areas of light and dark skin. These individuals, if they so decided to use a lightening process to even out their skin tone, could apply a topical cream containing the organic compound [[monobenzone]] to lessen the remaining pigment. Monobenzone may cause destruction of [[melanocytes]] and permanent depigmentation. An alternate method of lightening is to use the chemical [[mequinol]] over an extended period of time. Increasingly, people who are not afflicted with the vitiligo experiment with lower concentrations of monobenzone creams in the hope of lightening their skin tone evenly.  However, monobenzone is not recommended for skin conditions other than vitiligo.

====Mercury====
Many skin whiteners contain toxic [[mercury (element)|mercury]], such as [[mercury(II) chloride]] or [[ammoniated mercury]] as the [[active ingredient]].  However, mercury has been banned in most countries for use in skin whitening (1976 in Europe, 1990 in the USA) because it accumulates on skin and it can have the opposite results in the long term.  As late as January 2016, the FDA published a warning not to use a particular brand of whitener{{snd}} Viansilk's "Crema Piel De Seda" ("Silky Skin Cream"), sold in the United States due to its mercury content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FDA Warns Consumers Not to Use Viansilk’s "Crema Piel De Seda" ("Silky Skin Cream")|url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm483831.htm|website = Drugs: Drug Safety and Availability|access-date = January 30, 2016|date = January 29, 2016|publisher = USFDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tranexamic acid====
[[Tranexamic acid]] is sometimes used in skin whitening as a topical agent, injected into a lesion,  and taken by mouth, both alone and as an adjunct to laser therapy; as of 2017 its safety seemed reasonable but its efficacy for this purpose was uncertain because there had been no large scale randomized controlled studies nor long term follow-up studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=LL|last2=Baibergenova|first2=A|title=Melasma: systematic review of the systemic treatments|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|volume=56|issue=9|pages=902–908|date=27 February 2017|doi=10.1111/ijd.13578|pmid=28239840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taraz|first1=M|last2=Niknam|first2=S|last3=Ehsani|first3=AH|title=Tranexamic acid in treatment of melasma: A comprehensive review of clinical studies|journal=Dermatologic Therapy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=e12465|date=30 January 2017|doi=10.1111/dth.12465|pmid=28133910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other====
Other options with some amount of research regarding their potential skin lightening abilities are [[licorice]] extract (specifically [[glabridin]]).

There is also a small amount of research showing oral supplements of [[pomegranate]] extract, [[ellagic acid]], [[vitamin E]], and [[ferulic acid]] can inhibit melanin production.&lt;ref&gt;''Experimental Dermatology'', August 2005, pages 601–608; ''Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry'', December 2005, pages 2368–2373; ''International Journal of Dermatology'', August 2004, pages 604–607; ''Journal of Drugs in Dermatology'', July–August 2004, pages 377-381; ''Facial and Plastic Surgery'', February 2004, pages 3–9; ''Dermatologic Surgery'', March 2004, pages 385–388; ''Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering'', March 2005, pages 272–276; ''Journal of Biological Chemistry'', November 7, 2003, pages 44320–44325; ''Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry'', February 2003, pages 1201–1207; ''International Journal of Cosmetic Science'', August 2000, pages 291–303; and ''Anti-Cancer Research'', September–October 1999, pages 3769–3774.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laser treatments==
Both ablative and nonablative lasers can have a profound effect on [[melasma]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. However, the results are not always consistent, and problems have been reported (such as hypo- or hyperpigmentation). Laser treatments of this kind are more likely to result in problems for those with darker skin tones.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology'', May 2006, supplemental, pages 262–271; ''Dermatologic Therapy'', January 2001, page 46; ''Journal of Cosmetic and Laser Therapy'', March 2005, pages 39–43; ''Journal of Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery'', April 2004, pages 97–102; ''Journal of Drugs in Dermatology'', November–December 2005, pages 770–774; ''Dermatologic Surgery'', October 2005, page 1263; and ''Lasers in Surgery and Medicine'', April 2000, pages 376–379.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cryosurgery==
Another alternative to laser treatment is [[cryosurgery]] using liquid nitrogen. Controlled destruction of skin cells causes the skin to naturally regenerate itself. Excess melanin comes to the surface and peels off in a few days. This is particularly useful in sensitive areas like the genitals where laser treatment could leave a scar. Efficacy of the treatment depends on the depth of the pigment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0515/p2365.html Cryosurgery for Common Skin Conditions - American Family Physician].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverse effects==
There is evidence to suggest that some types of skin-whitening products use active ingredients, such as mercurous chloride and [[hydroquinone]], which can be harmful. Hydroquinone is not available without a prescription in Europe. It is only available when prescribed by a medical doctor (e.g. a general practitioner). This is also the case in many other countries, where hydroquinone can only be prescribed by a doctor for certain skin conditions.

A test of common skin lightening creams available in [[Nigeria]] showed that they caused [[mutations]] in bacteria and were possibly [[carcinogenic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akortha|first=E.E. |author2=Niemogha, M.T. |author3=Edobor, O.|title=Mutagenic and Genotoxic Screening of Eight Commonly used Skin Whitening Creams in Nigeria |journal=Bayero Journal of Pure and Applied Sciences|date=1 June 2012|volume=5|issue=1|pages=5–10|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/bajopas/article/view/80929/71155|accessdate=25 December 2012|doi=10.4314/bajopas.v5i1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study that examined skin whitening creams in [[Mexico]] found a high concentration of mercury in several of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mercury Levels in Locally Manufactured Mexican Skin-Lightening Creams|author1=Peregrino, C.

==Society and culture==
In India, the sales of skin lightening creams in 2012 totaled around 258 tons and in 2013 sales were about $300 million.&lt;ref&gt;Narayan, A.  Bloomberg Business Week, A Lucrative Promise for India's men: Whiter skin, Dec 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Narayan|first1=Adi|title=A Lucrative Promise for India's Men: Whiter Skin|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-05/makers-of-skin-lightening-creams-target-indias-men|work=Bloomberg News|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013 the global market for skin lighteners was projected to reach US$19.8 billion by 2018 based on sales growth primarily in Africa, Indian-Asia, and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDougall|first1=Andrew|title=Skin lightening trend in Asia boosts global market|url=http://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Market-Trends/Skin-lightening-trend-in-Asia-boosts-global-market|publisher=Cosmetics Design Asia|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]] many skin whiteners are illegal due to possible adverse effects.  Such products are frequently still sold even after shops have been prosecuted.  [[Trading standards]] departments lack resources to deal with the problem effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45085674|title=Skin-whitening creams: The battle against illegal products|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=6 August 2018|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34470">'''Student engagement''' occurs when "students make a psychological investment in learning. They try hard to learn what school offers. They take pride not simply in earning the formal indicators of success (grades), but in understanding the material and incorporating or internalizing it in their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Newmann, F. (1992) ''Student Engagement and Achievement in American Secondary Schools''. [[Teachers College Press]]. pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the U.S. college dropout rate for first-time-in college degree-seeking students is nearly 50%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nscresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/NSC_Signature_Report_8_StateSupp.pdf|title = Completing College: A State-Level View of Student Attainment Rates (Signature Report No. 8a)|date = February 2015|access-date = February 23, 2016|website = |publisher = National Student Clearinghouse Research Center|author = Shapiro, D.|author2 = Dundar, A.|author3 = Wakhungu, P.|author4 = Yuan, X.|author5 = Harrell, A.|last-author-amp = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is increasingly seen as an indicator of successful [[classroom]] [[Education|instruction]], and as a valued outcome of [[school reform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waston|first1=Sarah|title=BENEFITS AND STRATEGIES OF STUDENT ENGAGEMENT|url=http://edufena.net/benefits-and-strategies-of-student-engagement/|website=Edufena|publisher=Sarah Watson|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was identified in 1996 as "the latest [[buzzword]] in education circles."&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, G. Kenny, D. and Dumont, R. (1995) ''Mission and Place: Strengthening Learning and Community Through Campus Design.'' Oryx/Greenwood. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Students are engaged when they are involved in their work, persist despite challenges and obstacles, and take visible delight in accomplishing their work.&lt;ref&gt;Schlechty, P. (1994). "Increasing Student Engagement." Missouri Leadership Academy. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Student engagement also refers to a "student's willingness, need, desire and compulsion to participate in, and be successful in, the learning process promoting higher level thinking for enduring understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Bomia, L., Beluzo, L., Demeester, D., Elander, K., Johnson, M., &amp; Sheldon, B. (1997). "The impact of teaching strategies on intrinsic motivation." Champaign, IL: ERIC Clearinghouse on Elementary and Early Childhood Education. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Student engagement is also a usefully ambiguous term for the complexity of 'engagement' beyond the fragmented domains of cognition, behaviour, emotion or affect, and in doing so encompass the historically situated individual within their contextual variables (such as personal and familial circumstances) that at every moment influence how engaged an individual (or group) is in their learning.

==Definitions==
Student engagement is frequently used to, "depict students' willingness to participate in routine school activities, such as attending class, submitting required work, and following teachers' directions in class."&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, E. (2003) "Assessing student engagement rates," ERIC Clearinghouse on Assessment and Evaluation. ERIC identifier: ED482269.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is also increasingly used to describe meaningful student involvement throughout the learning environment, including students participating in [[curriculum]] design, [[classroom management]] and school building climate.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2005) ''[http://www.soundout.org/MSIGuide.pdf Guide to Students as Partners in School Change.]'' Olympia, WA: SoundOut. Retrieved 2/20/08.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often used to refer as much to student involvement in extra-curricular activities in the campus life of a school/college/university which are thought to have educational benefits as it is to student focus on their curricular studies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]] (2007), ''A large and liberal education': higher education for the 21st century'', Melbourne: Australian Scholarly Publishing &amp; Trinity College, University of Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a number of studies student engagement has been identified as a desirable trait in schools; however, there is little consensus among students and educators as to how to define it.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, L., &amp; Parsons, J. (2011). Improving Student Engagement. [[Current Issues in Education]], 14(1), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, student engagement is defined according to one of the most popular measures of student engagement - the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kezar|first=Adrianna J.|last2=Kinzie|first2=Jillian|date=2006-03-08|title=Examining the Ways Institutions Create Student Engagement: The Role of Mission|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/194611|journal=Journal of College Student Development|volume=47|issue=2|pages=149–172|doi=10.1353/csd.2006.0018|issn=1543-3382}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other studies have shown that student engagement overlaps with, but is not the same as, student [[motivation]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharan, S. Shachar, H. and Levine, T. (1999) ''The Innovative School: organization and instruction. Praeger/Greenwood. p. 85.''&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the lack of consensus on what student engagement is (and what it is not), researchers have begun to offer suggestions for moving the educational literature towards a unified conceptualization of student engagement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahu|first=Ella R.|date=2013-06-01|title=Framing student engagement in higher education|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2011.598505|journal=Studies in Higher Education|volume=38|issue=5|pages=758–773|doi=10.1080/03075079.2011.598505|issn=0307-5079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fredricks|first=Jennifer A|last2=Blumenfeld|first2=Phyllis C|last3=Paris|first3=Alison H|date=2004-03-01|title=School Engagement: Potential of the Concept, State of the Evidence|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00346543074001059|journal=Review of Educational Research|language=en|volume=74|issue=1|pages=59–109|doi=10.3102/00346543074001059|issn=0034-6543}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balwant|first=Paul T.|date=2017-02-28|title=The meaning of student engagement and disengagement in the classroom context: lessons from organisational behaviour|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0309877X.2017.1281887|journal=Journal of Further and Higher Education|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–13|doi=10.1080/0309877x.2017.1281887|issn=0309-877X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These researchers generally adopt a combination of [[psychology|psychological]] and socio-cultural perspectives to represent student engagement as three dimensions including affect, behavior, and cognition. Using these perspectives, some researchers have further borrowed from work psychology research to suggest that the 'engaged' part of student engagement means that student harness themselves to their role, and thus show a high level of activation or energy&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burch|first=Gerald F.|last2=Heller|first2=Nathan A.|last3=Burch|first3=Jana J.|last4=Freed|first4=Rusty|last5=Steed|first5=Steve A.|date=2015-05-19|title=Student Engagement: Developing a Conceptual Framework and Survey Instrument|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08832323.2015.1019821|journal=Journal of Education for Business|volume=90|issue=4|pages=224–229|doi=10.1080/08832323.2015.1019821|issn=0883-2323}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In light of these recent studies, one definition of student engagement is that it is "''highly activated and pleasurable emotional, behavioural and cognitive involvement in academic activities''"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Student engagement is used to discuss students' attitudes towards school, while student ''dis''engagement identifies withdrawing from school in any significant way.&lt;ref&gt;Willms, J.D. (2003) ''Student Engagement at School: a sense of belonging and participation: Results from PISA 2000.'' Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. p. i.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
Student engagement requires that teachers actively seek to create the conditions that foster this reaction. The first step to whole-school improvement in the area of student engagement is for the entire building faculty to share a definition of student engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Berardi, L. and Gerschick, T. (nd) [http://www.teachtech.ilstu.edu/additional/tips/facEngage.php "University Faculty Members' Perceptions of Student Engagement: An Interview Study.] Center for Teaching, Learning and Technology. Retrieved 7/2/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Other steps include clear articulation of learning criteria with clear, immediate, and constructive feedback; show students the skills they need to be successful are within their grasp by clearly and systematically demonstrating these skills, and; demonstrate engagement in learning as a valuable aspect of their personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, R. Silver, H. and Robinson, A. (1995) "What do students want (and what really motivates them)?" ''Educational Leadership.'' September. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships between students and adults in schools, and among students themselves, are a critical factor of student engagement. This is especially true among students considered to be at-risk and without other positive adult interaction.&lt;ref&gt;McCombs, B.L., &amp; Pope, J.E. (1994). "Motivating hard to reach students." Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several strategies for developing these relationships, including acknowledging [[student voice]], increasing [[intergenerational equity]] and sustaining [[youth-adult partnerships]] throughout the learning environment.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2005) [http://www.soundout.org/MSIStories.pdf Stories of meaningful student involvement.] Olympia, WA: CommonAction. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been multiple formats identified for this type of engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, D. and Meece, J. (1992) ''Student Perceptions in the Classroom.'' Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Survey of Student Engagement]] identifies dozens of everyday indicators of student engagement throughout colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.longwood.edu/assessment/Survey/Freshman/NSSE_Definitions.htm Definitions]. Longwood University. Retrieved 7/2/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indicators==
The term "student engagement" has been used to depict students' willingness to participate in routine school activities, such as attending classes, submitting required work, and following teachers' directions in class.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, E. (2003). [http://PAREonline.net/getvn.asp?v=8&amp;n=13 "Alternative approaches to assessing student engagement rates."] ''Practical Assessment, Research &amp; Evaluation, 8''(13). Retrieved 7/2/07.&lt;/ref&gt; That includes participating in the activities offered as part of the school program&lt;ref&gt;Natriello, G. (1984). "Problems in the evaluation of students and student disengagement from secondary schools." ''Journal of Research and Development in Education, 17'' p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and student participation in school reform activities.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2005) [http://www.soundout.org/MSIGuide.pdf Meaningful student involvement: Guide to students as partners in school change.] Olympia, WA: CommonAction. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Students] who are engaged show sustained behavioral involvement in learning activities accompanied by a positive emotional tone. They select tasks at the border of their competencies, initiate action when given the opportunity, and exert intense effort and concentration in the implementation of learning tasks; they show generally positive emotions during ongoing action, including enthusiasm, optimism, curiosity, and interest.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, E.A., &amp; Belmont, M.J. (1993). "Motivation in the classroom: Reciprocal effects of teacher behavior and student engagement across the school year." ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 85''(4). p. 572.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another study identified five indicators for student engagement in college. They included the level of [[academic]] challenge, [[active learning|active]] and [[collaborative learning]], student-faculty interaction, enriching education experiences and a supportive learning environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, G. Kenny, D. and Dumont, R. (1995) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Indicators of the absence of student engagement include unexcused absences from classes, cheating on tests, and damaging school property.&lt;ref name="Chapman, E. 2003"&gt;Chapman, E. (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The opposite of engagement is disaffection. Disaffected [students] are passive, do not try hard, and give up easily in the face of challenges... [they can] be bored, depressed,
anxious, or even angry about their presence in the classroom; they can be withdrawn
from learning opportunities or even rebellious towards teachers and classmates.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, E.A., &amp; Belmont, M.J. (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Engagement is more than what student listen &amp; do. A high level of engagement results in better learning, and the learner will be emotionally connected, feel satisfied with the course &amp; the institution.&lt;ref&gt;(Fredrick et al. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; proposes a frame work in terms of Emotional, Behavioral &amp; Cognitive.&lt;ref&gt;Newmann et al. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted that the engagement is related with the Mastery of academic work.&lt;ref&gt;Strong et al. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; described the process of student engagement. The author stated that the student engagement stimulates the curiosity.;;&lt;ref&gt;Christenson &amp; Anderson, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newmann, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt; identified four dimensions including academic, Affective, Behavioral, &amp; Cognitive

==Measuring student engagement==
Assessing student engagement is seen as an essential step towards a school becoming a successful proponent.&lt;ref&gt;(2005) [http://www.utc.edu/news/qep.php "UTC working to enhance student engagement"]. University of Tennessee - Chattanooga. Retrieved 7/2/07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Critical pedagogy|Critical educators]] have raised concerns that definitions and assessments of student engagement are often exclusive to the values represented by dominant groups within the learning environment where the analysis is conducted.&lt;ref&gt;Hurtado, S. (1999) "Reaffirming Educators Judgment: Educational Value of Diversity." ''Liberal Education'', Spring, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several methods to measure student engagement. They include self-reporting, such as [[course evaluation|surveys]], questionnaires, checklists and rating scales. [https://www.glisser.com/student-engagement/ Technology], such as [[audience response systems]], can be used to aid this process. Researchers also use direct observations, work sample analyses, and focused [[case study|case studies]].&lt;ref name="Chapman, E. 2003"/&gt;

===Measuring student engagement among student-athletes===

[[Student athlete]]s create one of the dominant groups in most learning environments in the United States of America. Most high schools and universities in the U.S. maintain a large [[student athlete]] population. Measuring how and why student athletes at colleges/universities engage with their surrounding academic and professional communities helps educational institutions better understand how they can help student athletes "make the most of the rich academic environment."&lt;ref name="sienasaints1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sienasaints.com/engagement/index.html |title=Siena Saints Official Athletic Site - Siena College |publisher=Sienasaints.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measurement through comparison====
The body of literature concerning college student athletes and how they spend their time has increased in recent years. Many educators and scholars have inquired whether participating in college athletics enhances or detracts from a student athlete’s college experience and whether participation in a sport negatively or positively affects other areas of a student-athlete’s college life. When analyzing the career of any college student or [[student athlete]] researchers often measure personal development to determine whether the student is happy and having a fulfilling college experience.&lt;ref name="sienasaints1"/&gt; For a student-athlete, personal development, a necessary ingredient to leading a successful life, includes participation in activities outside the sphere of one’s sport and interaction with non-athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gayles|first=Joy|title=Influence of Student Engagement and Sport Participation on College Outcomes among Division I Student Athletes|url=http://0-muse.jhu.edu.library.lausys.georgetown.edu/journals/journal_of_higher_education/v080/80.3.gayles.html|publisher=Ohio State University Press|author2=Shouping Hu|location=The Journal of Higher Education|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Student athletes and non-student athletes====
Many scholars approach research concerning student athletes by comparing student athletes to non-athletes. In studies, such as those presented in the article, "A Comparison of Athletes and Nonathletes at Highly Selective Colleges: Academic Performance and Personal Development",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/40197362 "A Comparison of Athletes and Nonathletes at Highly Selective Colleges: Academic Performance and Personal Development"]&lt;/ref&gt; which look at the behavior of students and student athletes, results have shown that student athletes perceive themselves as less intelligent, but more sociable than non-athletes.&lt;ref name="aries597"/&gt; Surveys asking student athletes about their engagement with other groups on campus have found that the majority of student athletes engages in extracurricular activities and spends more than half of its time interacting with non-athletes. A trend in results developed as well; freshman student athletes proved to be more socially outgoing than senior student-athletes who admitted to spending more time with teammates.&lt;ref name="gayles317"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gayles|first=Joy|title=Influence of Student Engagement and Sport Participation on College Outcomes among Division I Student Athletes|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jhe/summary/v080/80.3.gayles.html|publisher=Ohio State University Press|author2=Shouping Hu|location=The Journal of Higher Education|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some literature that attempts to explain student athlete involvement in extracurricular activities looks at factors such as the profile of the sport, the educational, social, economic and cultural background of athletes and characteristics of the institution, which may or may not support and foster student-athletes’ involvement in groups and clubs outside of their team.&lt;ref name="gayles317"/&gt; In determining levels of student engagement among college [[student athlete]]s, methods of comparison between student athletes and non-athletes, females and males, [[NCAA]] divisions and revenue generating and non-revenue generating sports have proven helpful. Some researchers believe that differences in how non-athletes and student athletes perceive themselves may determine their level of involvement on college/university campuses. Research has shown that “high-commitment athletes were distinguished from non-athletes by their lower perception of themselves throughout college as smart, intellectual, and artistic/creative, and a higher perception of themselves as socially skilled, outgoing, confident and good leaders.”&lt;ref name="aries597"&gt;{{cite web|last=Aries|first=Elizabeth|title=A Comparison of Athletes and Nonathletes at Highly Selective Colleges: Academic Performance and Personal Development|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.library.lausys.georgetown.edu/stable/40197362|publisher=Springer|accessdate=13 March 2012|author2=Danielle McCarthy|author3=Peter Salovey|author4=Mahzarin R. Banaji|location=Research in Higher Education|pages=577–602}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the contrasts in where non-athletes and student athletes believe their strengths lie, “high-commitment athletes were as likely as non-athletes to report every year that they had grown as a person, pursued new activities and interests, gotten to know people from different backgrounds, and found a place at the college/university.”&lt;ref name="aries597"/&gt;

====Comparisons by gender====
Many studies have shown that “on average, [[student athlete]]s are as engaged in most educationally purposeful activities as their peers.”&lt;ref name="umbach10"&gt;{{cite web|last=Umbach|first=Paul|title=Intercollegiate Athletes and Effective Educational Practices: Winning Combination or Losing Effort?|url=http://nsse.iub.edu/pdf/research_papers/athletes.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2012|author2=Megan M. Palmer|author3=George D. Kuh|author4=Stephanie J. Hannah|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other comparisons have been made among student athletes in order to better understand which kind of student athlete pursues greater educational engagement. For example, when “compared with male non-athletes, male student athletes are as challenged academically, interact with faculty as frequently, and participate as often in active and collaborative learning activities,” however, “female student athletes" when compared to female non-athletes "are more likely to interact with faculty and participate in active and collaborative learning activities.”&lt;ref name="umbach10"/&gt;  The size of the institution has also been studied as a possible factor in determining a student athlete’s engagement. Some researchers argue that “more selective, smaller schools with low student-faculty ratios have higher levels of engagement, as well as schools classified as baccalaureate institutions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Porter|first=Stephen|title=Institutional Structures and Student Engagement|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.library.lausys.georgetown.edu/stable/40197601|publisher=Springer|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comparisons by division====
Within the [[NCAA]], colleges and universities are placed in one of three classifications: [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]], [[Division III (NCAA)|Division II]] and [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]]. Research suggests that [[student athlete]]s from each division differ in their behavior and levels of engagement. For instance, “for both men and women, students at Division III schools report higher levels of academic challenge...” and “interact with faculty more than students at Division I and Division II schools.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Umbach|first=Paul|title=Intercollegiate Athletes and Effective Educational Practices: Winning Combination or Losing Effort?|url=http://nsse.iub.edu/pdf/research_papers/athletes.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2012|author2=Megan M. Palmer|author3=George D. Kuh|author4=Stephanie J. Hannah|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such findings have caused some to conclude that student athletes at "small residential liberal arts colleges (most of which are Division III schools)" are more engaged than student athletes in Division I and Division II institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Umbach|first=Paul|title=Intercollegiate Athletes and Effective Educational Practices: Winning Combination or Losing Effort?|url=http://nsse.iub.edu/pdf/research_papers/athletes.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2012|author2=Megan M. Palmer|author3=George D. Kuh|author4=Stephanie J. Hannah|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in the levels of student-athlete engagement among institutions from different divisions may be explained by stated philosophies of each division. Institutions that compete at the Division III level “offer athletics because of its inherent educational value” and view athletics as an extension of the school’s “educational mission.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=The National Collegiate Athletic Association|title=NCAA Division III Governance Issues Booklet|year=September 2008|pages=69–70|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/DIII_MC_PC/Misc/Governance_Issues.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Member institutions of Division II broaden the focus of Division III members and place an equal amount of emphasis on academic, athletic and social success. According to the NCAA Division II Philosophy Statement, “the Division II approach provides growth opportunities through academic achievement, learning in high-level athletics competition and development of positive societal attitudes in service to community.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Go Argos.com|url=http://www.goargos.com/page.asp?articleID=3707|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated philosophy of Division I institutions places less emphasis on the personal, social and intellectual growth of their student-athletes and states that its “ultimate goal is for student-athletes to graduate” because “a college degree gives student-athletes more options in life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The National Collegiate Athletic Association|title=The National Athletic Collegiate Athletic Association|url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Academics/Academic+Division+I+landing+page|publisher=NCAA|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Increasing student engagement==

Several methods have been demonstrated to promote higher levels of student engagement.  Instructors can enhance student engagement by encouraging students to become more active participants in their education through setting and achieving goals and by providing collaborative opportunities for educational research, planning, teaching, evaluation, and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2005) ''[http://www.soundout.org/MSIGuide.pdf Meaningful Student Involvement Guide to Students as Partners in School Change].'' Olympia, WA: SoundOut. Retrieved 10/20/10.&lt;/ref&gt; Providing teachers with training on how to promote student autonomy was beneficial in enhancing student engagement by providing students with a more autonomous environment, rather than a controlling environment.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve,J. ,Jang, H., Carrell, D.,  Jeon, S. and Barch, J. 2004. Enhancing Students’ Engagement by Increasing Teachers’ Autonomy Support. Motivation and Emotion, Vol. 28, 147-169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another method of promoting student engagement is through the use of learning communities, a technique that has a group of students taking the same classes together.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Zhao, C. and G.D. Kuh. 2004. Adding Value: Learning Communities and Student Engagement. Research in Higher Education, Vol. 45, 115-138.&lt;/ref&gt; By being part of a group taking the same classes, students show an increase in academic performance and collaborative skills.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; Increasing student engagement is especially important at the university level in increasing student persistence.&lt;ref&gt;Kuh, G.D., Cruce, T.M. and R. Shoup. 2008. Unmasking the Effects of Student Engagement on First-Year College Grades and Persistence. The Journal of Higher Education, Vol.79, 540-563.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also increase students’ mastery of challenging material.&lt;ref&gt;Hake, R.R. 1997.

=== Learning communities ===
{{main|Learning community}}
One method that has been gaining popularity in University teaching is the creation or encouragement of learning communities (Zhao and Kuh 2004).  Learning communities are widely recognized as an effective form of student engagement and consist of groups of students that form with the intention of increasing learning through shared experience.  Lenning and Ebbers (1999) defined four different types of learning communities:
1. Curricular communities which consist of students co-enrolled in multiple courses in the same field of study.
2. Classroom learning communities that focus on group learning activities in the classroom.
3. Residential learning communities that are formed off-campus that provide out of the classroom learning and discussion opportunities.
4. Student-type learning communities that are created for special groups of students.
Within learning communities, students are able to interact with peers who share similar interests and stimulate conversation about the topic.  Such conversations are beneficial because they expose the members of the community to new ideas and methods.  Students that are a part of such communities are therefore able to generate and construct their knowledge and understanding through inquisitive conversations with peers, as opposed to being given information by the instructor.  This type of engagement in the field leads to a deep understanding of the material and gives the student a personal connection to the topic (Zhao and Kuh 2004).

Organizing classrooms into learning communities allows instructors to constantly gather evidence of student learning to inform and improve their professional practice. They use common assessments and make results from those assessments easily accessible and openly shared among members of the team in order to build on individual and team strengths and to identify and address areas of concern. Results are then used to identify students who are experiencing difficulty and need additional time and support for learning as well as students who are highly proficient and require enrichment and extension. Learning community programs also improve students' interpersonal dialogue, collaboration, and experiential learning within the context of diversity, these programs address a decreasing sense of community and connection and allow students to relate their college-level learning to larger personal and global questions.

=== Connected learning ===
The connected learning educational approach is based on evidence that suggests that the most resilient, adaptive, and effective learning involves individual interest as well as social support to overcome adversity and provide recognition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ito|display-authors=etal|date=2013|title=Connected Learning: An Agenda For Research and Design|url=https://dmlhub.net/wp-content/uploads/files/Connected_Learning_report.pdf|journal=Digital Media and Research Hub|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research conducted by the Digital Media and Learning Research Hub, connected learning “advocates for broadened access to learning that is socially embedded, interest-driven, and oriented toward educational, economic, or political opportunity.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Connected learning environments are learning communities where the walls that separate student learning in and out of school are taken down, opportunities outside of traditional school organizational systems are created, and curricula and instruction is better aligned with student interests.

Connected learning results when a pupil is able to pursue a passion or interest of theirs with the support of peers and caring adults and links their learning and interests to academic achievement, career success, and/or civic engagement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The critical components that encompass connected learning environments include: 1) greater depth and breadth of interests, 2) peer, adult, and institutional learning supports, and 3) greater academic orientation.

The connected learning approach calls for a central focus to include the linking of deep “vertical” expertise with horizontal expertise and creating connections to other cultural domains and practices, and also expects an outcome of the learning approach to be to deepen and expand each student’s areas of interests and expertise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A successful connected learning environment can deepen and expand each student’s interests, expertise, and knowledge by challenging them to learn and explore content outside of their “islands of expertise,” and emphasizing the importance of dialogue and connection practices.

Connected learning environments allow students to be embedded in social networks and communities of different interests and expertise that they can call upon for help, feedback, and mentorship. Connected learning environments are characterized by their “low barriers to entry and a multiplicity of roles, ways of participating, and improving and gaining expertise.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The goal of connected learning is to integrate the peer culture, academics, and interests in the way that each individual student is best reached.

=== Displaying work in the community ===
Student engagement represents two critical features of collegiate quality. The first is the amount of time and effort students put into their studies and other educationally purposeful activities. The second is how the institution deploys its resources and organizes the curriculum and other learning opportunities to get students to participate in activities that decades of research studies show are linked to student learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsse.iub.edu/html/about.cfm|title=About NSSE|website=NSSE|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== School climate ===
{{main|School climate}}
The J. Erik Jonsson Community School (3 year-old-5th grade) in Dallas, TX has a simple formula for success: "Powerful Pedagogy + trusting relationships = student engagement" (Journal of Staff Development, 2008).  The majority of research is done is early education (Pre-School-5th), but this sentiment rings equally true in higher education.  Accomplishing that end is nearly impossible in introductory, general education classes with class enrolments reaching up to 300 students at some schools but relationship-building is a skill that is under-appreciated in the "college experience".
In Australia many schools offer an integrated program developed by [[Hands On Learning Australia]] which provides a type of micro-climate for students experiencing disengagement to develop trusting relationships in the context of practical, construction based, tasks.

A '''Sun scoop'''  or sunscoop is a [[Refueling and Overhaul|refueling]] technique for starships seen in science fiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8225">[[File:Sustained Silent Reading in Laos 2013.jpg|thumb|Children in a Lao primary school on their first day of a Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) program. This village, in Kasi district of Laos, was the site of the first SSR program in Laos. It was set up by Big Brother Mouse, which publishes and distributes books to promote reading and literacy, with an emphasis on easy and fun books that children are eager to read.]]'''Sustained silent reading''' ('''SSR''') is a form of school-based recreational reading, or '''free voluntary reading''', where students read silently in a designated time period every day in school.  An underlying assumption of SSR is that students learn to read by reading constantly. Successful models of SSR typically allow students to select their own books and require neither testing for comprehension nor book reports.  Schools have implemented SSR under a variety of names, such as "Drop Everything and Read (DEAR)", "Free Uninterrupted Reading (FUR)", or "Uninterrupted sustained silent reading (USSR)".

==Value of Sustained silent reading==

===Advocates' perspective===
According to advocates such as [[Stephen Krashen]], SSR has been shown to lead to gains in several literacy domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krashen|first=Stephen|title=False Claims About Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, Skills vs. Whole Language, and Recreational Reading|url=http://www.nochildleft.com/2003/may03reading.html|publisher=No Child Left|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krashen looked at a large number of studies to see what conclusions were supported by empirical evidence.

He found that in respect to reading comprehension, SSR is successful; 51 of 54 studies found that students in an SSR program scored as well as, or better than, other students in this regard. It is most successful when used for longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, S. 2007. "Extensive reading in English as a foreign language by adolescents and young adults: A meta-analysis." ''International Journal of Foreign Language Teaching'' 3(2): 23-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, SSR was shown to create a reading habit. Several years after participating in a program, students reported more reading.&lt;ref&gt;Greaney, V., and M. Clarke. 1973. "A longitudinal study of the effects of two reading methods on leisure-time reading habits." In ''Reading: What of the future?'' ed. D. Moyle. London: United Kingdom Reading Association, pp. 107-14, cited in ''Free Voluntary Reading'' by Stephen Krashen.&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that a single SSR session was enough to change attitudes about reading. Long-term effects of SSR include better vocabularies, better writing skills, better spelling, and greater knowledge of literature, science, and "practical knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, Stephen D., 2011. ''Free Voluntary Reading.'' Santa Barbara: Libraries Unlimited, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies noted that children in poor neighborhoods had less access to books at home and in libraries, and often the books available to them were not books that they wanted to read.&lt;ref&gt;Worthy, J., M. Moorman, and M. Turner. 1999. What Johnny likes to read is hard to find in school. Reading Research Quarterly 34(10): 12-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Prize-winning books were often not especially popular with children. Comic books, on the other hand, are often not available in libraries, but are popular with many boys, and reading comics was found to increase reading of other books.&lt;ref&gt;Ujiie, J., and S. Krashen. 1996. Is comic book reading harmful? Comic book reading, school achievement, and pleasure reading among seventh graders. California School Library Association Journal 19(2): 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three studies showed that providing rewards for reading did not improve reading development. Krashen believes this is because the presence of a reward suggests that an activity is work, and makes it less appealing.&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, Stephen D., 2011. ''Free Voluntary Reading.'' Santa Barbara: Libraries Unlimited, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In two studies, teachers noted fewer discipline problems when an SSR program was being used.&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, Stephen D., 2011. ''Free Voluntary Reading.'' Santa Barbara: Libraries Unlimited, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates also point out that students in SSR programs have more positive attitudes toward reading than students who do not participate in SSR programs.

===National Reading Panel analysis of sustained silent reading studies===
The [[National Reading Panel]] (NRP) in the United States meta-analyzed all quasi-experimental and experimental studies of SSR and challenged the claim that SSR has positive effects. The panel stated that the literature contained insufficient numbers of quasi-experimental or experimental studies on SSR to validate its use as a sound educational practice. The panel also noted that the absence of quantitative evidence was not evidence against the practice in itself.  They recommended further study of SSR.

Jim Trelease is one of many reading advocates who has disputed the impartiality of these findings. He points out that the NRP included only 14 research tests in their summary, out of 54 studies he identified that might have been used. In 10 of the studies used by NRP, SSR students performed the same as other students, and in 4 studies, SSR students did better.&lt;ref&gt;Trelease, Jim, ''The Read-Aloud Handbook'' Penguin Books, 2006. E-book version, no page reference available.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some argue the NRP is not impartial at all. In fact, the NRP only included studies that were verifiable and with scientifically credible designs. The NRP had rigorous guidelines for the studies it would include. For example, the NRP did not include studies without control groups. The fact that the NRP only analyzed 14 SSR studies, shows that the other studies were not scientifically credible. 

In the full group of 54 studies, SSR students performed better in 25, worse in 3, and the same in 24. SSR students scored worse only in short-term studies of less than 7 months. In studies that lasted one year or longer, SSR students did better in 8 of 10, and there was no difference in the other two. The NRP found that most of the SSR studies were not valid or verifiable. Many studies were simply correlational. Thus, only 14 studies actually followed guidelines that could make them statistically significant. Of these studies, SSR was found ineffective.  

"Where do these negative SSR feelings come from?" Trelease asks. "Perhaps from the wonderful folks who make all those workbooks, textbooks, and score sheets that wouldn't be bought and used in class during the time students were lounging around reading books, magazines, and newspapers and getting so good at reading they might need even fewer of those sheets next year." There is some support for this charge: A blog titled "Why Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) Doesn't Work" is posted by the publisher of four workbooks that sell for $89.99 each.&lt;ref&gt;http://penningtonpublishing.com/blog/reading/why-sustained-silent-reading-ssr-doesn’t-work/ accessed August 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, SSR was found ineffective by the NRP, not by publishing companies.

==Sustained silent reading practices==
A range of practices have been associated with SSR, and some advocates suggest that teacher models of reading behavior (i.e., teachers read while the students read), a long-term commitment to SSR, availability of multiple level, high-interest texts, and a sense of reading community are particularly relevant.

==Free voluntary reading (FVR)==
'''Free voluntary reading''' ('''FVR''') or '''recreation reading''', related to the [[comprehensible input|comprehension hypothesis]], is an educational theory that says many student gains in reading can be encouraged by giving them time to read what they want without too many evaluative measures.  Sustained silent reading is a method of implementing recreational and FVR theory.

==In popular culture==
*DEAR and SSR play a cameo role in the [[Ramona Quimby]] series of children's books by [[Beverly Cleary]], in which young Ramona uses her assignment as an excuse not to talk to an annoying younger child.

'''The Art Genome Project''' is the search technology behind [[Artsy (website)|Artsy]].

The Art Genome Project's search technology is the product of an ongoing art-historical study—undertaken by a team of contributors with art-historical backgrounds at Artsy—seeking to define the characteristics which distinguish and connect works of art, architecture, ancient artifacts and design.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Its primary aim is to provide Artsy users dynamic search categories and explain similarities among art and artists. Currently, there are 1000+ "[[genes]]" (i.e. attributes of art) in the project’s taxonomy, including art-historical movements, subject matter, and formal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumgeek.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/interview-matthew-israel-on-the-art-genome-project/|title=Interview: Matthew Israel on The Art Genome Project|work=museum geek}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genes are the product of Artsy’s team and their engagement with (and feedback from) the museums, galleries, curators, critics and art historians present on Artsy’s platform.

There are two general parts of the project: 1) Conceiving and defining such characteristics, referred to as "[[gene]]s," and 2) Applying these genes to artists and artworks—creating "[[genome]]s" for both—for the artsy.net site.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Importantly, unlike tags, which are binary, genes are applied with values ranging from 0 to 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_artsy/all/1|title=Art.sy's 'Genome' Predicts What Paintings You Will Like - WIRED|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seminarstogo.wordpress.com/2012/10/14/the-art-genome-project/|title=The Art Genome Project|work=Seminars To Go}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value indicates the degree of relevance of a gene to an artist or work of art. While not seen by users, such gene values account for the strength of a relationship between artists and artworks. It also enables similarity to be expressed in a more nuanced way&lt;{{cn|date=March 2018}} than it might be with just tags because one can weigh various attributes of an artist or work of art to establish which might be the most or less important. Furthermore, such nuance allows for matching potential collectors with artworks based on their tastes and preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_artsy/all/1|title=Art.sy's 'Genome' Predicts What Paintings You Will Like - WIRED|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Anita. "Works for Me: A Recommendation Engine Takes On Fine Art." Time Magazine (June 4, 2012), 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artsy’s "genes" create various opportunities for discovering and learning about the artist and artworks. If users search for an artist, they can see "related" artists and if they search for an artwork, they can see "related" artworks. Genes (with definitions) also appear on their own pages and provide the backbone for Artsy’s Browse page.

The Art Genome Project provides [[metadata]] for search (and similarity) results based on the principles of [[information retrieval]] (TF/IDF) and presents results in a [[User experience design|UX]]-driven search product.

Matthew Israel, an art historian, is the Director of The Art Genome Project.&lt;ref&gt;http://matthewisraelprojects.tumblr.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precedents for The Art Genome Project ==

The Art Genome Project has often been compared to [[Pandora Radio|Pandora's]] [[Music Genome Project]], and was originally developed in consultation with Pandora’s Joe Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/artsy-launch/|title=Two Years In Coming, Art.sy Finally Brings Pandora’s Genome Project To The Wacky World Of Art|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping-the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html?pagewanted=1&lt;/ref&gt; Both aim to create comprehensive (though by no means exhaustive) analyses of types of art by identifying a set of criteria, which both call "genes". These are both broadly applicable to their respective art forms, as well as useful for generating interesting connections for users. Importantly, while The Art Genome is currently one extensive list of genes for all works of art, Pandora has separate genomes (lists of genes) for each genre of music.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The Music Genome Project and TAGP are examples of [[Big Data]], which is a sector of [[algorithm]]ic technology that synthesizes data to predict what users will prefer. Artsy’s genome is user facing, allowing users to navigate genes manually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domusweb.it/en/design/2013/04/22/retooling_history.html|title=Retooling history|work=domusweb.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netflix]] also makes customized recommendations to users based on the qualities of the movies that they enjoy. [[Amazon (website)|Amazon Art]] makes suggestions to users based on their browsing and purchasing history.

Museums and galleries as well as other online art image databases, such as [[Google Art Project]] and [[Artstor]], digitize artworks for public access, but beyond providing basic metadata (artist, title, date, medium) these databases do not extensively classify works of art or create connections between them.

== The Art Genome Project and Other Taxonomies for Artwork ==

Art historians, libraries and image archives have long used classification systems, art cataloging standards or metadata, and created taxonomies, such as The Getty Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/|title=Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (Getty Research Institute)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to systematize the description of artworks. Classification is one of the major foundations of the discipline of art history.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Most college and university art history surveys are based on such an idea of classification, to provide students with a way of grasping the history of art and a jumping-off point for more focused research. Unlike other types of classification, The Art Genome's taxonomy was designed for the purposes of establishing similarities between artists and artworks.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

=== Genes versus Tags ===

In the words of Matthew Israel, Director of The Art Genome Project, "Genes are not tags — though we have many tags on the site — because tags are binary (something is either tagged "dog" or not). Genes, in contrast, can range from 0-100, thus capturing how strongly a gene applies to a specific artist or artwork. This nuanced connection between works of art is impossible with a simple tagging mechanism."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quora.com/What-is-The-Art-Genome-Project&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, The Art Genome Project does incorporate over 6000 tags for content (iconography) in artwork as well as certain materials and mediums, which do not need the nuance of genes.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Reception ==

=== Positive Reception ===
Digtalmeetsculture.net calls TAGP "user-friendly," "intelligent and orchestrated behind the scenes by the Artsy experts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/article/artsy-all-the-world%E2%80%99s-art-freely-accessible/|title=ARTSY, all the world’s art freely accessible|work=Digital meets Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex.com highlighted genes in their article "15 Awesome Genes on Artsy"  to show "just how incredible their project is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/art-design/2012/11/15-awesome-genes-on-artsy/|title=15 Awesome Genes on Artsy|author=Cedar Pasori|work=Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New York Times, the [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum|Cooper-Hewitt]] Museum’s director of new and emerging media Seb Chan said, "sites like Art.sy were not meant to replace museums, galleries or books, but rather to help the public, especially art neophytes, stretch the boundaries of their taste. ‘You shouldn’t need to be a scholar to discover works of art that you might be fascinated by,’ he said. ‘You go to museums and you browse — chancing upon things is what it’s all about. The Art Genome is another way of creating serendipitous connections.’"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping-the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Olivares praised The Art Genome’s comprehensiveness, objectivity and ability to accommodate future revisions: "Unlike books, which can only be modified between editions, the website is made of millions of layers of edits that can be reworked at any time… [and] [u]nlike the opinionated and subjectively ordered history book, this neutral and re-configurable database will allow us to access any work of art or design, within any imaginable order, and instantly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domusweb.it/en/design/2013/04/22/retooling_history.html|title=Retooling history|work=domusweb.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Criticism around The Art Genome Project centers on "its classification system, which rubs some artists the wrong way."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Anita. "Works for Me: A Recommendation Engine Takes On Fine Art." Time Magazine (June 4, 2012), 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have questioned the accuracy of the connections made through genes: "'I don't think what I am doing has anything to do with [[Cindy Sherman]],' says British artist Jonathan Smith after being told the site links his work to hers via a staged-photography gene. 'That sounds like something a programmer would think of."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Anita. "Works for Me: A Recommendation Engine Takes On Fine Art." Time Magazine (June 4, 2012), 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have highlighted the subjective nature of genes and expressed a concern that they might be applied reductively.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping-the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Descent of Anansi''''' is a 1982 [[science fiction]] novel by American writers [[Steven Barnes]] and [[Larry Niven]].

== Plot summary==

A space station-manufactury attempts to become commercially independent from its Government backers by exporting super-strong nanowire that can only be manufactured in free-fall.

Following an attempt to sabotage their first delivery and hijack the cargo, the intrepid crew realise they can escape the hijackers. Their shuttle ''Anansi'' can become a modern-day version of [[Anansi|its namesake]], an African Spider-god, by descending to Earth on a thread.

The physics of tidal forces are explained, and the possibilities of orbital tethers to accelerate payloads into higher orbits (or indeed de-orbit shuttles without retro-rockets) are woven into a [[hard science fiction]] thriller. The Anansi incident, Falling Angel, and other elements of the story are used as background in the Dream Park series, also written by Larry Niven and Steven Barnes - particularly ''The Barsoom Project'', the second of the series.

There are several differences in pronunciation between Standard and Tunisian Arabic. [[Nunation]] does not exist in Tunisian Arabic, and short [[vowels]] are frequently omitted, especially if they would occur as the final element of an [[open syllable]], which was probably encouraged by the Berber [[substratum]].&lt;ref name="jabe2"&gt;Jabeur, M. (1987). A sociolinguistic study in Rades, Tunisia. Unpublished PhD dissertation. Reading: University of Reading.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wise"&gt;Wise, H. (1983). Some functionally motivated rules in Tunisian phonology. Journal of Linguistics, 19(01), 165-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are some more specific characteristics related to Tunisian Arabic like the phenomenon of [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]].&lt;ref name="wise"/&gt;

==Metathesis==

Metathesis is the shift of the position of the first vowel of the word.&lt;ref name="wise" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chekili"&gt;Chekili, F. (1982). The morphology of the Arabic dialect of Tunis (Doctoral dissertation, University of London).&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs when the unconjugated verb or unsuffixed noun begins with CCVC, where C is an ungeminated consonant and V is a short vowel.&lt;ref name="wise" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chekili"  /&gt;&lt;ref name="suny"&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/suyeon/www/Suyeon_Yuns_website/Presentations_files/ALS27_Suyeon.pdf Yun, S. (2013). To Metathesize or Not to Metathesize: Phonological and Morphological Constraints. XXVIIth Annual Arabic Linguistics Symposium. Massachusetts Institute of Technology.]&lt;/ref&gt; When a suffix is added to this kind of noun or when the verb is conjugated, the first vowel changes of position and the verb or noun begins with CVCC.&lt;ref name="wise" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chekili" /&gt;&lt;ref name="suny" /&gt;

For example:
* ''(he) wrote'' in Tunisian Arabic becomes كتب ''kt'''i'''b'' and ''(she) wrote'' in Tunisian Arabic becomes كتبت ''k'''i'''tbit''.&lt;ref name="wise" /&gt;
* ''some stuff'' in Tunisian Arabic becomes دبش ''db'''a'''š'' and ''my stuff'' in Tunisian Arabic becomes دبشي ''d'''a'''bšī''.&lt;ref name="wise" /&gt;

==Stress==

Stress is not phonologically distinctive&lt;ref name="chekili" /&gt; and is determined by the word's syllable structure. Hence, 
* it falls on the ultimate syllable if it is doubly closed:&lt;ref name="chekili" /&gt; سروال ''sir'''wāl''''' (trousers).
* Stress falls on all the word if there is only one syllable within it:&lt;ref name="chekili" /&gt; مرا '''''mṛa''''' (woman).
* Affixes are treated as part of the word:&lt;ref name="chekili" /&gt; نكتبولكم ''nikt'''bū'''lkum'' (we write to you).

For example:
* جابت '''''jā'''bit'' (She brought).&lt;ref name="chekili" /&gt;
* ما جابتش ''mā jā'''bitš''''' (She did not bring).&lt;ref name="chekili" /&gt;

== Assimilation ==

Assimilation is a phonological process in Tunisian Arabic.&lt;ref name="chekili" /&gt; The possible assimilations are:

==Phonemes==

===Consonants===

Tunisian Arabic ''[[qāf]]'' has {{IPAblink|q}} and {{IPAblink|ɡ}} as reflexes in respectively sedentary and nomadic varieties: ''he said'' is {{IPA|[qɑːl]}} instead of {{IPA|[ɡɑːl]}}). However, some words have the same form {{IPAblink|ɡ}} whatever the dialect: ''cow'' is always {{IPA|[baɡra]}}&lt;ref name="baccouchel"&gt;{{fr}} Baccouche, T. (1972). Le phonème 'g' dans les parlers arabes citadins de Tunisie. Revue tunisienne de sciences sociales, 9(30-31), 103-137.&lt;/ref&gt; (the /g/ deriving from an originally Arabic [q]), and a specific species of ''date'' is always {{IPA|[digla]}}&lt;ref name="Dico Karmous"&gt;Abdellatif, K. (2010). Dictionnaire «le Karmous» du Tunisien&lt;/ref&gt; (the /g/ deriving from an originally Semitic [q] - e.g. [[Aramaic]]: /diqla/: date tree).

Interdental fricatives are also maintained for several situations, except in the Sahil dialect.&lt;ref name="dialecit"&gt;{{it icon}} DURAND, O. (2007). L'arabo di Tunisi: note di dialettologia comparata. ''Dirāsāt Aryūliyya. Studi in onore di Angelo Arioli'', 241-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Tunisian Arabic merged {{IPAslink|dˤ}} {{angbr|{{lang|ar|ض}}}} with {{IPAslink|ðˤ}} {{angbr|{{lang|ar|ظ}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;Boussofara-Omar, H. (1999). Arabic Diglossic Switching in Tunisia: An Application of Myers-Scotton's MLF Model (̂Matrix Language Frame Model). (Doctoral dissertation, University of Texas at Austin).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phonetic notes:'''
* /p/ and /v/ are found in borrowed words and are usually replaced by /b/, like in ''ḅāḅūr'' and ''ḅāla''. However, they are preserved in some words, like ''pīsīn''  and ''talvza''.&lt;ref name="chekili" /&gt;
* /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡z/ are rarely used, for example ''tšīša'', ''dzīṛa'' and ''dzāyir''.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00593352/document Ben Farah, A. (2008). Les affriquées en dialectal tunisien. In Atlas linguistique de Tunisie.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Like in [[Standard Arabic]], ''[[shadda]]'' "[[gemination]]" is very likely to occur in Tunisian. For example, ''ha'''dd'''ad'' هدد meaning to threaten.&lt;ref name="chekili" /&gt;

* Unlike other Maghrebi dialects,{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} short [[Ḍammah|u]] and [[Kasrah|i]] are [[Vowel reduction|reduced]] to {{IPA|[o]}} and {{IPA|[e]}} when written between two consonants unless when they are in stressed syllables.&lt;ref&gt;Abou Haidar, L. (1994). Norme linguistique et variabilité dialectale: analyse formantique du système vocalique de la langue arabe. ''Revue de Phonétique Appliquée'', 110, 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Belkaid, Y. (1984). Arabic vowels, modern literature, spectrographic analysis. ''Phonetic Works Strasbourg Institution'', 16, 217-240.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syllables and pronunciation simplification===
As well as those characteristics, Tunisian Arabic is also known for differently pronouncing words according to their orthography and position within a text.&lt;ref&gt;Ghazali, S., Hamdi, R., &amp; Barkat, M. (2002). Speech rhythm variation in Arabic dialects. In Speech Prosody 2002 International Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, D., &amp; Verhoeven, J. (2002). Frequency analysis of Arabic vowels in connected speech. Antwerp papers in linguistics., 100, 77-86.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is known as pronunciation simplification&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, R. A. (1977). Arguments for a Non-transformational Grammar. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and has four rules:
* [iː] and [ɪ], at the end of a word, are pronounced [i] and [uː]. Also, [u] is pronounced [u] and [aː]. [ɛː], [a] and [æ] are pronounced [æ].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Barkat, M. (2000). Détermination d'indices acoustiques robustes pour l'identification automatique des parlers arabes. De la caractérisation…… à l'identification des langues, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barkat-Defradas, M., Vasilescu, I., &amp; Pellegrino, F. (2003). Stratégies perceptuelles et identification automatique des langues. Revue PArole, 25(26), 1-37.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, yībdā is practically pronounced as {{IPA|[jiːbdæ]}}&lt;ref name="douzlr"&gt;{{de icon}} Ritt-Benmimoun, V. (2005).

* If a word finishes with a vowel and the next word begins with a short vowel, the short vowel and the space between the two words are not pronounced ([[Elision]]).&lt;ref name="wise" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heath, J. (1997). Moroccan Arabic phonology. Phonologies of Asia and Africa (including the Caucasus), 1, 205-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

WestEd was formed in 1995 when the Southwest Regional Educational Laboratory (SWRL), located in Los Alamitos, California, merged with the [[Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development]] (FWL), located in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Profiles of the regional educational laboratories (SuDoc ED 1.302:P 94/13), page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; SWRL and FWL were established in 1966, shortly after the passage of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] (ESEA) (Pub.L. 89-10, 79 Stat. 27, 20 U.S.C. ch.70), a United States federal statute enacted April 11, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;From U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 79, p. 27 - 58 http://nysl.nysed.gov/uhtbin/cgisirsi/M8BhPv34Ie/NYSL/7400017/524/79170&lt;/ref&gt; The Act funded several areas of primary and secondary education including professional development, instructional materials, resources to support educational programs, and parental involvement promotion. FWL and SWRL were established under ESEA (1965) Title IV, which established funding for educational research and training.

==Research and Technical Assistance Centers==
WestEd operates several federal research and technical assistance centers.

===Regional Educational Laboratory West===
The [[United States Department of Education]] Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Program is a network of ten laboratories. &lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/about/&lt;/ref&gt; 

WestEd was awarded the contract to operate the Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) West (serving [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Nevada]], and [[Utah]]) for the current period, running from January 2012 through the end of 2016. &lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/west/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Under the current contract, REL West partners with regional educators to form research alliances dedicated to addressing regional needs and increasing the use of data and evidence in education decision-making. &lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/west/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

WestEd has operated REL West since the REL Program's inception in 1966. In the previous contract cycle (2006–2011), REL West published over 30 peer-reviewed studies &lt;ref&gt;http://relwest-archive.wested.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and held 36 technical assistance events bridging research, policy, and practice, with well over 2,000 participants. &lt;ref&gt;http://relwest.wested.org/events&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, REL West also delivered over 200 written responses to education questions from regional stakeholders and provided technical assistance to numerous state education agencies, state boards of education, legislators, local schools and districts, and professional associations.

===California Comprehensive Center===
The federal Comprehensive Centers Program is administered by the United States Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, School Support and Rural Programs. &lt;ref&gt; http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oese/sst/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www2.ed.gov/programs/newccp/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Comprehensive Centers Program supports 22 comprehensive centers to help increase state capacity to assist districts and schools meet their student achievement goals. &lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ed.gov/programs/newccp/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reading Apprenticeship===
WestEd's Reading Apprenticeship program is a research-based instructional framework that is supposed to improve the teaching effectiveness of content-area middle and high school teachers, literacy coaches, and teacher educators.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wested.org/project/reading-apprenticeship/&lt;/ref&gt; The approach helps adolescent students become more confident, engaged, and strategic readers.&lt;ref&gt;R. Schoenbach and C. Greenleaf, "Fostering Adolescents' Engaged Academic Literacy." In L. Christenbury, R. Bomer, and P. Smagorinsky (2009). New York: The Guilford Press. {{ISBN|978-1-59385-829-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Litman and C. Greenleaf, "Traveling Together over Difficult Ground: Negotiating Success with a Profoundly Inexperienced Reading in an Introduction to Chemistry Class." In K. Hinchman and H. Sheridan-Thomas (2008). Best Practices in Adolescent Literacy Instruction. New York: The Guilford Press. {{ISBN|978-1-59385-692-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, WestEd received a federal Investing in Innovation (i3) grant to address the persistent academic achievement gaps in the nation's high schools by scaling up the Reading Apprenticeship model of academic literacy instruction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readingapprenticeship.org/cs/ra/view/sli_r/13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.data.ed.gov/grants/investing-in-innovation/applicant/15273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www2.ed.gov/programs/innovation/2010/applications.html#validation&lt;/ref&gt; This collaborative effort is providing research-based, discipline-focused professional development to 2,800 high school of biology, U.S. history, and English language arts; and is reaching more than 400,000 students in 300 schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.data.ed.gov/grants/investing-in-innovation/applicant/15273&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wested.org/research_study/reading-apprenticeship-improving-secondary-education-raise/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, WestEd received another i3 grant from the U.S. Department of Education to adapt a rigorously researched face-to-face Reading Apprenticeship professional development model into an alternative web-based model for high school science teachers: Internet-Based Reading Apprenticeship Improving Science Education (iRAISE). During the three-year grant period, 150 teachers and 33,000 students will be impacted by the iRAISE professional development. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.readingapprenticeship.org/cs/ra/view/sli_r/15&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first Reading Apprenticeship study was conducted in 1996-1997 in one San Francisco public high school. Students gained an average of two years growth in seven months of instruction measured on a standardized reading comprehension test, while engaging in rigorous, academic work rather than remediation focused on basic skills.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbach, R., C. Greenleaf, C. Cziko, and L. Hurwitz (1999). Reading for Understanding: A Guide to Improving Reading in Middle and High School Classrooms. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass/John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-7879-5045-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guzzetti, B. (2007). Literacy for the New Millennium: Adolescent literacy. Praeger. {{ISBN|978-0-275-98994-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program tenets and the results were published in the book, ''Reading for Understanding'' (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass), which recently had its second edition published.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.josseybass.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470608315.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, A Randomized Controlled Study of the Efficacy of Reading Apprenticeship Professional Development for High School History and Science Teaching and Learning was funded by the [[Institute of Education Sciences]], National Center for Education Research.&lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/funding/grantsearch/details.asp?ID=339&lt;/ref&gt; Reading Apprenticeship is one of only two supplemental literacy programs selected by the [[Institute of Education Sciences]] for a rigorous evaluation, initiated in 2006.

In 2008, the Enhanced Reading Opportunities Study, also funded by the [[Institute for Education Sciences]], reported that Reading Apprenticeship Academic Literacy had a positive and statistically significant impact on reading comprehension test scores (0.14 standard deviation; p-value = 0.015).&lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20094036/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'No Effects' Studies Raising Eyebrows" (April 1, 2009) Education Week, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 Final Report of the Enhanced Reading Opportunities Study indicated, “Overall, the findings from these reports show that over the course of ninth grade, the ERO programs [Reading Apprenticeship Academic Literacy and Xtreme Reading] improved students’ reading comprehension skills and helped them perform better academically in their high school course work.” &lt;ref&gt; Somers, M.-A., Corrin, W., Sepanik, S., Salinger T., Levin, J., and Zmach, C. (2010). The Enhanced Reading Opportunities Study Final Report: The Impact of Supplemental Literacy Courses for Struggling Ninth-Grade Readers (NCEE 2010-4021).

This is accomplished through "training-of-trainers" institutes, regional outreach activities, training materials, and demonstration programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cainclusivechildcare.org/bt/ Retrieved October 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the California Map to Inclusive Child Care project provides a statewide system of support, information and resources for families and providers to facilitate barrier–free access to inclusive child care for children birth to 21.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cainclusivechildcare.org/camap/index.html Retrieved October 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

PITC worked with the Administration for Children, Youth, and Families to develop the Early Head Start program, and has presented training institutes and technical assistance for more than 500 programs serving families with children from birth to three.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca S. New and Moncrieff Cochran. Early Childhood Education [Four Volumes]  An International Encyclopedia. Praeger Publishers, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; PITC staff have worked with representatives of 19 states, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pitc.org/pub/pitc_docs/ww.html&lt;/ref&gt; and over 7,500 trainers, college faculty, and program directors have attended PITC training modules since 1990. In 2002, the [[National Center for Children in Poverty]] selected PITC as a model initiative to support infants, toddlers, and their families. The Center for Child and Family Studies and the University of Cincinnati are codeveloping an online associate degree program for early Head Start teachers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uc.edu/news/NR.aspx?id=10648 Retrieved October 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Making Sense of SCIENCE===
Making Sense of SCIENCE (formerly "Understanding Science") is a nationally field-tested professional development program that helps teachers learn major concepts of K-8 science, examine how children make sense of those concepts, and analyze and improve their science teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, J. I., Daehler, K., &amp; Shinohara, M. (2003, Fall). Connecting all the pieces: Using an
evaluation mosaic to answer an impossible question. Journal of Staff Development, 24, 36-
41.&lt;/ref&gt; Making Sense of SCIENCE professional development modules help teachers actively learn science in combination with student thinking and teaching. Each module focuses on cases of actual classroom practice that illustrate students’ science ideas and highlight an important teaching dilemma, one that any teacher might face.&lt;ref&gt;Daehler, K. R., &amp; Shinohara, M. (2001). A complete circuit is a complete circle: Exploring the potential of case materials and methods to develop teachers’ content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge of science.

Connecting all the pieces: Mosaic approach to evaluation makes a complete picture. Journal of Staff Development, 24 (4), 36-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers engage in hands-on science activities that parallel those of students in the cases, examine student work, and critically analyze classic instructional activities and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Shinohara, M., &amp; Daehler, K. R. (2006). Developing a case-based science curriculum for teacher learning: Practical lessons learned. In A. Lieberman &amp; L. Miller (Eds.), Competence and community.

Distributed by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, Southfield, MI.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal investigators are Kirsten Daehler and Mayumi Shinohara.

In 2005, the [[Institute of Education Sciences]], National Center for Education Research funded the development of three teacher professional development courses in the Making Sense of SCIENCE series that address challenging physical science and earth science topics: heat and energy, plate tectonics, and climate and weather.&lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/funding/grantsearch/details.asp?ID=522&lt;/ref&gt; This development grant includes three small, randomized controlled studies to assess the potential efficacy of each of these courses separately to improve teacher content knowledge and student learning, and the reduction of the science achievement gap between English learners and English-proficient speakers. A fourth study will assess the potential efficacy of the entire sequence of courses on teacher knowledge and student science achievement. In 2009 the [[Institute of Education Sciences]] funded a [[Cluster randomised controlled trial|randomized-cluster]] experimental design study, Impact of the Making Sense of SCIENCE Professional Development Model on Science Achievement of English Language Learner Students, to evaluate the effects of WestEd's Making Sense of SCIENCE model of professional development &amp;mdash; an approach that emphasizes inquiry-based instruction practices that depend less on English proficiency, textbook knowledge, and direct instruction &amp;mdash; on student achievement in science, especially English language learner students.&lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/projects/rct_87.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Science Foundation]] has funded a large-scale study, Learning Science for Teaching: Effects of Content-Rich and Practice-Based Professional Development Models on Teacher Content Knowledge, Classroom Practice, and Student Learning, examining the effects of promising professional development models on teachers, classrooms, and students.&lt;ref&gt;http://cse.edc.org/tpc/projects/default.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12785&amp;org=EHR&amp;from=fund&lt;/ref&gt;
