      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4597">'''Abiku''' is a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word that can be translated as "predestined to death". It is from (abi) "that which possesses" and (iku) "death".

== Definition ==
Abiku refers to the spirits of children who die before reaching puberty; a child who dies before twelve years of age being called an Abiku, and the spirit, or spirits, who caused the death being also called Abiku.

Not only is an ''abiku'' a spirit of a child who dies young, the belief is that the spirit returns to the same mother multiple times to be reborn multiple times. It is the belief that the spirit does not ever plan to "stay put in life" so it is "indifferent to the plight of its mother and her grief."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3334754|title=The Concept of Abiku|last=Mobolade|first=Timothy|date=September 1, 1973|publisher=UCLA James S.

The spirits themselves are believed to live in trees, especially the iroko, baobab and silk-cotton species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mythicalcreatureslist.com/mythical-creature/Abiku|title=Abiku - mythical creature|website=mythicalcreatureslist.com|access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
"[[Ben Okri|Ben Okri's]] novel ''[[The Famished Road]]'' is based upon an abiku. [[Debo Kotun|Debo Kotun's]] novel ''[[Abiku (novel)|Abiku]]'', a political satire of the Nigerian military oligarchy, is based upon an abiku. [[Gerald Brom|Gerald Brom's]] illustrated novel, ''[[The Plucker]]'', depicts a child's toys fighting against an abiku," as described by Pulse. An Abiku Child's return also occures in the writing of Slovenian Novelist [[Gabriela Babnik]], in her novel [[Koža iz bombaža]]. We also see [[Wole Soyinka]]'s poem 'Abiku' rely heavily on this occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mounira|first=Soliman,|date=January 1, 2004|title=From Past to Present and Future: The Regenerative Spirit of the Abiku|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-126387266/from-past-to-present-and-future-the-regenerative|journal=Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics|issue=24|issn=1110-8673}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pulse.ng/books/nigerian-poetry-3-african-poems-about-abiku-you-should-read-id4241698.html|title=Nigerian Poetry: 3 African poems about Abiku you should read - Pulse Books - Pulse|last=Quadri|first=Zaynab|access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/wole-soyinka-abiku/|title=Wole Soyinka (Abiku) Poem by African Poems - Poem Hunter|newspaper=PoemHunter.com|language=en-EN|access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theluminafoundation.org/writers-contributors/18-aderonke-adesola-adesanya/61-wole-soyinka-s-protracted-struggle-with-abiku-the-metaphor-of-the-nigerian-state|title=Wole Soyinka’s Protracted Struggle With Àbíkú, the Metaphor of the Nigerian State|last=|first=|date=|website=www.theluminafoundation.org|publisher=|access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
A review of the oral histories around ''abiku'' note that:

"Such accounts (sometimes they are just hasty definitions) often mix facts about ''àbíkú'' with facts about ''[[Ogbanje|ògbánje]]''; represent àbíkú as homogeneous across time and space; fail to distinguish between popular and expert, official and heretical, indigenous and exogenous discourses of àbíkú; assume that the belief in àbíkú has a psychological rather than ontological origin; and hastily appropriate àbíkú to serve as a symbol for present-day, metropolitan concepts and concerns."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Acamapichtli'''  ({{lang-nci-IPA|Ācamāpichtli|aːkamaːˈpit͡ʃt͡ɬi}}, meaning "Handful of reeds") was the first ''[[tlatoani]]'', or ruler, of the [[Aztecs]] (or Mexica) of [[Tenochtitlan]], and founder of the Aztec imperial dynasty.&lt;ref name="Aguilar-Moreno"&gt;{{cite book | last = Aguilar-Moreno | first = Manuel | title = Handbook to Life in the Aztec World | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2007 | location = Oxford and New York | isbn = 978-0-19-533083-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became ruler in 1375 and reigned for 19 years.

== Biography ==

=== Family and early life ===
Acamapichtli was not a native of Tenochtitlan. Blood relationships between rulers were an important aspect of politics in 14th century Mexico, and as relative newcomers, the Mexicans were at a disadvantage. On the death of [[Tenoch]] in 1375, the elders of the Mexica ''[[calpulli|calpultin]]'' decided to elect a ''tlatoani'' who could secure the fledgling city's position through ties to powerful groups in the region. They sent a delegation to the leaders of [[Culhuacán (altepetl)|Culhuacan]]. Although the Culhua had only recently ejected the Mexica from [[Tizaapan]], some intermarriage had taken place between the two peoples during their period of association. Acamapichtli was the product of one such union. His father, [[Opochtli Iztahuatzin]], was a Mexica leader, while his mother [[Atotoztli I]] was the daughter of the King [[Coxcoxtli]] and sister of King [[Huehue Acamapichtli]]. He also had ties to the [[Acolhua]] of [[Coatlinchan]]. In addition to these concrete ties, the Culhua nobility claimed direct descent from the [[Toltecs]], making their bloodline particularly prestigious.

The Spanish colonial historians [[Diego Durán]], [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl]], and [[Fernando Alvarado Tezozómoc]] each mention Acamapichtli's maternal uncle, who occupied the throne of Culhuacan in 1324.

=== Reign ===
[[File:Acamapichtli, the First Aztec King (Reigned 1376–95) WDL6718.png|thumbnail|left|Acamapichtli as depicted in the [[Tovar Codex]].]]
Acamapichtli began his rule as ''cihuacóatl'' (governor). At the time of his designation he was 20 years old, living in [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]] with his mother. After his acceptance of the throne, he was brought to Tenochtitlan and made his entry into the city with great pomp. He married [[Ilancueitl]], daughter of the then ruler of [[Culhuacán (altepetl)|Culhuacán]], Acolmiztli.


To integrate these ties with the city of Tenochtitlan, Acamapichtli took a wife from each Tenochtitlan ''[[calpulli]]'' (in addition to his first wife Ilancuetl).

In the same year, Tenochtitlan's sister city of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] also installed an outsider as ''tlatoani'' &amp;mdash; [[Cuacuapitzahuac]], son of [[Tezozomoc (Azcapotzalco)|Tezozómoc]], ''tlatoani'' of the [[Tepanec]] city of [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]], the other major power in the region.

Despite Acamapichtli's Culhua ancestry, his city rapidly fell into the Tepanec orbit and became a tributary of Azcapotzalco. During his reign Mexica forces fought for Azcapotzalco against various city states, notably [[Chalco, México|Chalco]], and were eventually allowed to wage war on their own. Expeditions were sent against Cuauhnahuac (modern [[Cuernavaca]]) and [[Xochimilco]].

Tribute was due to the Tecpanec rulers every full moon, a tribute said to be oppressive and capricious. In spite of the hostility of Azcapotzalco, Tenochtitlan progressed. The island on which the city was situated (and the only territory subject to its rule) was enlarged to the east with the addition of dirt and rock. The Mexica were careful, however, to maintain a proper distance from the mainland, for defensive purposes in the event of war.

Built in the middle of [[Lake Texcoco]], Tenochtitlan suffered from limited farmland. Acamapichtli built up the city's agricultural base by expanding the ''[[chinampa]]'' system ("floating" gardens) around the island, and by capturing lakeshore chinampas from other cities, particularly [[Xochimilco]]. He also made improvements to the city's architecture &amp;mdash; the earliest excavated level of the [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan|Great Pyramid]], Temple II, dates to his reign.

During his reign, the city was divided into four neighborhoods or ''[[calpulli]]s'': Moyotlán in the southwest; Zoquipan in the southeast; Cuecopan in the northwest; and Atzacualco in the northeast. Houses of cane and reeds were replaced with houses of stone. A great temple, or ''[[teocalli]]'', was also constructed. It is said that during his reign, the first Aztec laws were made.

In 1382, Acamapichtli was named ''tlatoani''. He was crowned with even more pomp than before, at the altar of [[Huitzilopochtli]]. He ascended the steps accompanied by the highest-ranking warriors. He was anointed with oil and water by the chief priest, who placed on his head the crown or ''xiuhuitzolli''. This same ceremony was repeated in all the subsequent Aztec coronations, with the difference that, from 1427, the new ''tlatoani'' was accompanied by the rulers of [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]] and [[Tlacopan]], the other two towns of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]].

Acamapichtli was an astute politician who strengthened his position more by alliances with his neighbors than by wars (of which there were only two or three during his reign). He avoided difficulties with the more powerful rulers, in the case of Tezozómoc, by paying the demanded tribute. Tezozómoc asked for a chinampa cultivated with beautiful flowers, and the Aztecs formed one, raised the flowers, and floated the chinampa to him over the lake.

===Heirs and succession===
Acamapichtli's first wife bore him no children, so he took another wife, [[Tezcatlan Miyahuatzin]]. She was the mother of [[Huitzilíhuitl]], who succeeded to the throne after the death of his father. Another son of Acamapichtli, [[Itzcóatl]], also became ''tlatoani'' in 1427. He was the son of a beautiful slave Acamapichtli had bought in the market of Azcapotzalco. She was of noble birth, but had been captured and enslaved. Although ''tlatoani'' was not strictly a hereditary title, candidates were clearly restricted to a small class of princes, and all later Aztec rulers descended from Acamapichtli.

Before his death, Acamapichtili called together the chiefs of the four neighborhoods into which he had divided the city, and asked them to elect his successor. Before the death of Acamapichtili, they chose his eldest son Huitzilíhuitl. Acamapichtili approved the election, and then died. After the death of his father, Huitzilíhuitl consolidated his power by ordering a new election, with more electors, including important warriors and priests.

==Personal life==
Among his wives were [[Ilancueitl]], [[Tezcatlan Miyahuatzin]], [[Huitzilxotzin]], and [[Xiuhcuetzin]].{{cn|date=September 2016}}

{{Eras of the Halakha}}
'''Achai Gaon''' (also known as '''Ahai of Shabḥa''' or '''Aha of Shabḥa''', [[Hebrew]]: '''רב אחא [אחאי] משַׁבָּחָא''') was a leading scholar during the period of the [[Geonim]], an 8th-century [[Talmud]]ist of high renown. He enjoys the distinction of being the first rabbinical author known to history after the completion of the [[Talmud]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle='Ahai|display='A&amp;#7717;ai|volume=1|page=429}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he never actually became the Gaon of either of the two [[Talmudic academies in Babylonia|academies]], the description "Gaon" attached to his name is a misnomer.

== Story of Gaonic Period ==
The [[Gaon (Hebrew)|gaon]] of [[Pumbedita]] having died, Aḥa was universally acknowledged to be the fittest man to succeed him. But a personal grudge entertained by the [[exilarch]] [[Solomon bar Ḥasdai]] induced the latter to pass over Aḥa, and to appoint [[Natronai ben Nehemiah]], Aḥa's secretary, a man considerably his inferior in learning and general acquirements. Highly incensed at this slight, the eminent scholar left [[Babylonia]] and settled in [[Israel (region)|Israel]], about 752-753, where he remained until his death. Notwithstanding [[Steinschneider]] (''Cat. Bodl.'' s.v.), who erroneously assigns 761 as the year, the exact date of his demise is unknown.

It must have been in Israel that Aḥa wrote his book entitled שאלתות ("Quæstiones" in the sense of disquisitions), as the title evinces; for this Aramaic word is employed in the sense of quæstio (the scientific investigation of a matter) by the Jews of Israel only ([[Shab.]] 30a). "Sheilta" is of Palestinian origin, as is shown by the words buẓina and bisha, which accompany it. [[S. Mendelsohn]] is quite correct in his explanation of the term (''Rev. Ét. Juives,'' xxxii. 56). If, therefore, [[Simeon Kayyara]] made use of the "Sheiltot" in his ''Halakhot Gedolot'', as is now certain, the statement of [[Abraham ibn Daud]] (according to whom Simeon's work was completed in 750) must be erroneous, since Aḥa did not leave Palestine before 752; and we know that [[Samuel Gaon]], whose successor he was to have become, did not die before 751-752. There are also other evidences of Palestinian influence in Aḥa's work. For example, his treatise indicates that besides the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (which, in the nature of things, was his chief authority) he made frequent use of the [[Jerusalem Talmud|Yerushalmi]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Ginzberg]], in his ''Geonica'', argues that all the alleged quotations from the Jerusalem Talmud can in fact be traced to other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; and of Palestinian [[Midrashim]], [[Leviticus Rabbah]], [[Ecclesiastes Rabbah]], and [[Tanḥuma]], all of which at this time were quite unknown in Babylonia (indeed, even [[Saadia Gaon]], almost two hundred years later, knew comparatively little of them).

== Aḥa's ''Sheiltot'' ==
The  ''Sheiltot'', also known as ''Sheiltot d’Rav Achai'' or ''Sheiltos'', is a collection of homilies (at once learned and popular) on [[Halakha|Jewish law]] and ethics.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  The whole character of the "Sheiltot" is Palestinian; and, as such, they are quite distinct from the contemporary synopses of [[Yehudai Gaon]] and Simeon Kayyara, which confine themselves to important decisions of the Talmud, with the omission of all discussions, and with the addition of short elucidations of words.

Aḥa's method is quite different from that of the Babylonian rabbis, who, caring little for the instruction of the common people, wrote scholastically. The ''Sheiltot,'' on the contrary, were written for thoughtful laymen. Aḥa's treatises upon Biblical and rabbinical precepts, numbering 190 or 191 (see Mendelsohn, l.c. 59), with additions from later writers, were written with special reference to the practice of such moral duties as benevolence, love, respect for parents, and love of truth. They are based upon the order of the [[parashot]], the weekly readings from the Law.

The beginning of the fourth "Sheilta," which is based upon the weekly lesson on "[[Noah]]," may serve as a specimen of the "Sheiltot." Stealing or robbery was explicitly forbidden to the [[Israelites]]; and the divine punishment for the transgression of this command is more severe than for other crimes. Thus, it is found that in the history of Noah, those of the generation of the [[Biblical Flood|Deluge]] suffered their hard fate solely on account of their violence, as it is said ([[Gen.]] vi. 13), "The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them." This moral condemnation is elaborated by Aḥa, who quotes from the Talmud and [[Midrash]] many passages concerning the baseness and godlessness of such crimes. He follows this statement—preceded by the introductory formula, "It is, however, questionable" (Beram ẓarik)—with casuistic inquiries; as, for example, whether it is proper to include in the designation of robbery, for which the Law ordains a twofold restitution, the case of a theft committed in the interest of the victim.

This illustration serves to show that the work is not intended for scholars alone, but also for popular instruction; and that the statement, so often repeated since the time of [[Meiri]], that the ''Sheiltot'' was a book merely for the instruction of youth, is also baseless. It is more probable that it is a collection of [[aggadic]]-[[halakic]] sermons, which Aḥa delivered in Palestine, where certainly he was held in high regard. With the decline of rabbinical knowledge in Palestine, Aḥa would have found but few pupils for pure halakic instruction; and he therefore endeavored to add aggadic elements to his lectures, in obedience to the general disposition of the Palestinians, who just then favored Aggadah.

This view best explains the word "derashah" (lecture), which occurs about thirty times in the ''Sheiltot,'' in connection with the citation of passages from the Talmud. If the supposition be true that the ''Sheiltot'' were derived from sermons, they may properly be considered, in the form in which they appear, as extracts or abstracts of such sermons, giving the introduction and the conclusion of the original derashah; while of the derashah proper—which no doubt consisted of aggadic and halakic quotations from Talmud and Midrash—only the heading is mentioned. Considering them as portions of sermons, the frequent repetitions that occur in the ''Sheiltot'' are not strange, as this would happen to the best of preachers; while it would be difficult to explain them if they were found in the strictly literary productions of one man. Of course, there can be no certain conclusions concerning the composition of the "Sheiltot" until the manuscript has been examined. The printed text, while it contains much matter of later date, lacks much that, according to older authorities, was formerly included. An accurate edition of the ''Sheiltot'' would be very valuable for textual criticism of the Babylonian Talmud, as indeed for Aramaic philology in general, since Aḥa wrote in the [[Aramaic]] vernacular.

Aḥa's work very soon won great esteem, and the work ''[[Halakot Gedolot]]'', which does not date from the year 750, but belongs to the oldest literature of the [[gaonic]] times, copies no less than one hundred and fifty passages from the ''Sheiltot.'' [[Sherira Gaon]] and his son, [[Hai Gaon]], mention the book by title; and it was likewise freely consulted by [[Rashi]] and the author of the ''[[Aruk]]''.

== Editions ==
(1) The first edition of the "Sheiltot" appeared in Venice, 1546, and was succeeded by the following: (2) An edition with a short commentary by [[Isaiah Berlin]] (Dyhernfurth, 1786); (3) another under the title תועפות ראם, with the commentary of [[Isaac Pardo]], Salonica, 1800–01; (4) with an extended commentary by [[Naphtali Ẓebi Judah Berlin]] (Wilna, 1861, 1864, 1867), which latter edition contains the commentary of Isaiah Berlin, as well as a number of variant readings taken from a manuscript of the year 1460, and a short commentary by [[Saul ben Joseph]], who probably lived in the first half of the 14th century. Manuscripts of the ''Sheiltot,'' but with essential divergences from the printed text, are to be found among the Hebrew manuscripts in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, Nos. 308, 309, and in the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford, Nos. 539, 540, 1317. In the latter library may be found also the hitherto unprinted commentaries by [[Solomon ben Shabbethai]] (541), and [[Johanan ben Reuben]] (542). (5) A variorum edition with extensive notes and alternative manuscript readings, along with commentaries from medieval manuscripts, by Samuel K. Mirsky, in five volumes, the final one posthumous, (New York &amp; Jerusalem, 1960-1974).

'''Alcimus''' (from {{lang-grc-gre|Ἄλκιμος}} ''Alkimos'', "valiant" or [[Hebrew]] אליקום ''Elyaqum'', "God will rise"), also called Jacimus, or Joachim ({{lang|grc|Ἰάκειμος}}), was a [[List of High Priests of Israel|High Priest of Israel]] for three years, 162–159 BCE, who espoused the [[Seleucid|Syria]]n cause.&lt;ref&gt;The record of his career may be found in [[1 Maccabees]] 7:4-50; 9:1-57; [[2 Maccabees]] 14; see also [[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' XII, 9-11; XX, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
According to [[1 Maccabees]] he was a descendant of the Biblical [[Aaron]], brother of [[Moses]], but not in the high-priestly line;&lt;ref&gt;1 Macc 7:14; also Ant, XX, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and being ambitious for the office of high priest, he traveled to [[Antioch]] to secure the assistance of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] king [[Demetrius I Soter]], who had just overthrown [[Antiochus V Eupator|Antiochus Eupator]].  Alcimus was of the Hellenizing party, and therefore bitterly opposed by the [[Maccabees]].

Demetrius sent an army under [[Bacchides (general)|Bacchides]] to establish Alcimus in the high priesthood at [[Jerusalem]].  The favor with which Alcimus was received by the Jews at Jerusalem on account of his Aaronic descent was soon turned to hate by his cruelties.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Smith |first=William |authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer) |title=Alcimus (1) |editor=[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |pages=102 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location=Boston |year=1867 |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0111.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028160524/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0111.html |archivedate=2007-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   When Bacchides and his army returned to Antioch, the [[Hasmonean]] [[Judah Maccabee]] attacked and overcame Alcimus, and drove him also to Syria.  There he secured from Demetrius another army, led by [[Nicanor (Syrian general)|Nicanor]], who, failing to overcome Judah by treachery, attacked him directly, but was defeated and killed.  A third and greater army, under Bacchides again, was dispatched to reinstall Alcimus.  Judah was defeated and killed, Alcimus established as high priest and a strong garrison left in Jerusalem to maintain him.  But he did not long enjoy his triumph, since he died soon after, while he was pulling down the wall of the temple that divided the court of the Gentiles from that of the Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' xii. 9. § 7&lt;/ref&gt;

His successor as High Priest is unknown, though some scholars suggest that this was the [[Teacher of Righteousness]], later founder of the [[Essenes]].

{{For|the work by George Berkeley|Alciphron (book)}}
'''Alciphron''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀλκίφρων}}) was an [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Sophism|sophist]], and the most eminent among the Greek [[Epistolography|epistolographers]].  Regarding his life or the age in which he lived we possess no direct information whatsoever.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Schmitz |first=Leonhard |authorlink= |title=Alciphron |editor=[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |pages=103 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location=Boston |year=1867 |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0112.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612053152/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0112.html |archivedate=2008-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
We possess under the name of Alciphron 116 fictional letters, in 3 books, the object of which is to delineate the characters of certain classes of men by introducing them as expressing their peculiar sentiments and opinions upon subjects with which they were familiar.  The classes of persons which Alciphron chose for this purpose are fishermen, country people, parasites, and ''[[hetaera]]e'' or [[Athens|Athenian]] [[courtesan]]s.  All are made to express their sentiments in the most graceful and elegant language, even where the subjects are of a low or obscene kind.  The characters are thus somewhat raised above their common standard, without any great violation of the truth of reality.

The form of these letters is exquisitely beautiful, and the language is the pure [[Attic Greek|Attic dialect]], such as it was spoken in the best times in familiar but refined conversation at [[Athens]], even though the imaginary writers are country people, fishermen, parasites and courtesans.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alciphron|volume=1|page=523}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city from which the letters are dated is, with a few exceptions, Athens and its vicinity; and the time, wherever it is discernible, is the period after the reign of [[Alexander the Great]].  The new [[Attic comedy]] was the principal source from which the author derived his information respecting the characters and manners which he describes, and for this reason these letters contain much valuable information about the private life of the Athenians of that time.

It has been said that Alciphron was an imitator of [[Lucian]]; but besides the style, and, in a few instances, the subject matter, there is no resemblance between the two writers: the spirit in which the two treat their subjects is totally different. Both derived their materials from the same sources, and in style both aimed at the greatest perfection of the genuine Attic Greek.  Classical scholar [[Stephan Bergler]] has remarked that Alciphron stands in the same relation to [[Menander]] as Lucian to [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref name="DGRBM"/&gt;

==Date==
Some earlier critics placed him, without any plausible reason, in the 5th century BCE.  The classical scholar [[Stephan Bergler]], and others who followed him, placed Alciphron in the period between [[Lucian]] and [[Aristaenetus]], that is, between 170 and 350 CE, while others again assign to him a date even earlier than the time of Lucian. Among the letters of Aristaenetus there are two between Lucian and Alciphron;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristaenetus]], i. 5 and 22&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been inferred that Alciphron was a contemporary of Lucian.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"/&gt;

==Editions==
The first edition of Alciphron's letters is that of Italian printer [[Aldus Manutius]], in his collection of the ''Greek Epistolographers'', [[Venice]], 1499, [[4to]].  This edition, however, contains only those letters which, in more modern editions, form the first two books.  Seventy-two new letters were added from a Vienna and a Vatican manuscript by [[Stephan Bergler]], in his edition ([[Leipzig]], 1715, [[8vo]].) with notes and a [[Latin]] translation. These seventy-two [[epistle]]s form the third book in Bergler's edition.  J. A. Wagner, in his edition ([[Leipzig]], 1798, 2 vols, [[8vo]].), with the notes of Bergler), added two new letters entire, and fragments of five others.  One long letter, which as of the 19th century had not been published entire in English, exists in several [[Paris]] manuscripts.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"/&gt;

'''Andre David Sennwald''' (August 4, 1907 — Jan 12, 1936) was a [[Film criticism|motion picture critic]] for ''[[The New York Times]]''.

==Life==
After graduating from [[Columbia University School of Journalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FE0bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9EsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2829%2C3966440|title=New York Critic Killed By Blast|date=Jan 13, 1936|via= Google News Archive Search|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sennwald was hired as a reporter for ''The New York Times'' in 1930. As the film critic [[Mordaunt Hall]] gave up his post in October 1934, Sennwald became his successor.&lt;ref name="KauffmannHenstell1972"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanley Kauffmann|authorlink1=Stanley Kauffmann|author2=Bruce Henstell|title=American film criticism, from the beginnings to Citizen Kane: reviews of significant films at the time they first appeared|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWpZAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Andre+Sennwald|accessdate=26 December 2016|year=1972|publisher=Liveright|isbn=978-0-87140-557-9|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3538">'''Arturo Berutti''' (c. 27 March 1862 in [[San Juan, Argentina]] - 3 January 1938 in [[Buenos Aires]]) was an Argentinian composer of [[classical music]] and [[libretto]]s. He was best known for his notable theme ''Pampa'' (1897). The opera was based on the life of [[Juan Moreira]]. One of the influential Argentinian opera composers of the late 19th and early 20th century and his music was influenced by the Italian opera. In 1895, he composed the opera ''Taras Bulba'' inspired on the novel by [[Nikolai Gogol]].

==Life==
He was born on 14 March 1858 or on 27 March 1862 in [[San Juan, Argentina]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Many sources give 1858, but his birth registration was also given as 27 March 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; Berutti studied law in Buenos Aires. Thanks to his winning talent in 1884, with scholarship at the music stadium and he was able to study in Europe. He began his education at the [[Leipzig Conservatory]] with [[Carl Reinecke]] and [[Salomon Jadassohn]] and later studied in Paris, France, in 1889 and Milan, Italy, by 1890, where he was interested with the lyrics in Italian and in 1892, he composed his first classical operas ''Vendetta'' and ''Evangelina''. He returned to his native Argentina in 1896 to focus on his composition work of writing various operas, the mostly on under his South American libretto issues. He was a pioneer of Argentine lyrics. He was also a music professor of [[Gilardo Gilardi]], where he was studied with him in Buenos Aires. He was also of his predominant production lyrics, what in much cases combined issues of Argentine [[folklore]] music. Berutti composed including with [[symphony]], [[sonata]] and [[song]]s. Between his script highlights the treaty translation of the [[harmony]] of Salomon Jadassohn. Berutti died on 3 January 1938, aged 76 or 80 in Buenos Aires.

'''Billy Murcia''' (October 9, 1951 – November 6, 1972) was the original drummer for the [[New York Dolls]].&lt;ref name=Jacobson&gt;Jacobson, Mark. [http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/features/music2002/n_7736/ "The Icon: Doll Face"], ''[[New York (magazine)]]'', September 23, 2002. Accessed May 28, 2009. "Then came the sad pictures: Johnny and Jerry, RIP, and Billy Murcia too, their first drummer, a Colombian from Jackson Heights, dead in a London bathtub."&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], and raised in [[Jackson Heights, New York]], USA.&lt;ref name=Jacobson/&gt;

Billy Murcia and [[Sylvain Sylvain]] both attended Quintano's School for Young Professionals, in the late sixties. It was at Quintano's that they met [[Johnny Thunders]], also a student there. They made their musical debut in 1967, in a band called "The Pox".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punkmodpop.free.fr/criminals_pic.htm|title=Criminals|author=|date=|work=|publisher=The Mod Pop Archives|accessdate=1 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927172009/http://punkmodpop.free.fr/criminals_pic.htm|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They owned and co-managed a clothing business called "Truth and Soul". Murcia was a fundamental ingredient of the original New York Dolls sound and played during their now-legendary series of weekly shows at the [[Mercer Arts Center]].

While on a brief tour of England in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wVgywyV-2WEC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22Billy+Murcia%22+dead+OR+death+OR+died&amp;cd=10#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Billy%20Murcia%22%20dead%20OR%20death%20OR%20died&amp;f=false New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation with Blondie, Iggy Pop, and ...] By Gary Valentine. Thunder's Mouth Press. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Murcia was invited to a party where he passed out from an accidental overdose. In an attempt to revive him he was put in a bathtub and force-fed coffee, which resulted in asphyxiation and death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/article2397258.ece Living (and dead) dolls] By Peter Shapiro The Times May 21, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He died before the New York Dolls recorded their first album and was later replaced by [[Jerry Nolan]] in 1973. The final gig of their tour, at the Manchester Hardrock, was canceled, and the band flew back to [[New York City]]. Murcia can be heard playing live with the New York Dolls on ''[[Lipstick Killers The Mercer Street Sessions 1972|Lipstick Killers: The Mercer Street Sessions]]''.

[[Johnny Thunders]] wrote a song called "Billy Boy", in honor of his friend and former band member.

The song "[[Time (David Bowie song)|Time]]", from [[David Bowie]]'s ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' album, references Murcia and his untimely demise.

[[File:Shimmering bees drive hornet away.ogv|thumb|A population of bees shimmers in response to a predator.]]

'''Biological organization''' is the [[hierarchy]] of [[complex systems|complex]] [[biology|biological]] [[structures]] and [[systems]] that define [[life]] using a [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] approach.&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|Berg|Martin|2002|pp=9&amp;ndash;10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional hierarchy, as detailed below, extends from [[atom]]s to [[biosphere]]s. The higher levels of this scheme are often referred to as an '''ecological organization''' concept, or as the [[Branches of science|field]],  [[#Fundamentals|hierarchical ecology]].

Each level in the hierarchy represents an increase in organizational [[wikt:complexity|complexity]], with each "object" being primarily composed of the previous level's basic unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle behind the organization is the concept of ''[[emergence]]''—the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and irrelevant at the lower levels.

The biological organization of life is a fundamental premise for numerous areas of [[scientific research]], particularly in the [[Medicine|medical sciences]]. Without this necessary degree of organization, it would be much more difficult—and likely impossible—to apply the study of the effects of various [[physical phenomenon|physical]] and [[chemical phenomenon|chemical]] phenomena to [[diseases]] and [[physiology]] (body function). For example, fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]] and [[behavioral neuroscience]] could not exist if the brain was not composed of specific types of cells, and the basic concepts of [[pharmacology]] could not exist if it was not known that a change at the cellular level can affect an entire organism. These applications extend into the [[ecological]] levels as well. For example, [[DDT]]'s direct [[insecticide|insecticidal]] effect occurs at the [[subcellular]] level, but affects higher levels up to and including multiple [[ecosystem]]s. Theoretically, a change in one [[atom]] could change the entire [[biosphere]].

==Levels==
[[File:Levels of Organization.svg|thumb|The simplest unit of life is the atom, like oxygen. Two or more atoms is a molecule, like a dioxide. Many small molecules may combine in a chemical reaction to make up a macromolecule, such as a phospholipid. Multiple macromolecules form a cell, like a club cell. A group of cells functioning together as a tissue, for example, Epithelial tissue. Different tissues make up an organ, like a lung. Organs work together to form an organ system, such as the Respiratory System. All of the organ systems make a living organism, like a lion. A group of the same organism living together in an area is a population, such as a pride of lions. Two or more populations interacting with each other form a community, for example, lion and zebra populations interacting with each other.  Communities interacting not only with each other but also with the physical environment encompass an ecosystem, such as the Savanna ecosystem. All of the ecosystems make up the biosphere, the area of life on Earth.]]
The simple standard biological organization scheme, from the lowest level to the highest level, is as follows:&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"/&gt;

|-
| colspan="3" style="vertical-align:middle;text-align:left" |''For levels larger than Biosphere or Ecosphere, see [[Earth's location in the Universe]]''
|-
|}

More complex schemes incorporate many more levels. For example, a molecule can be viewed as a grouping of [[chemical element|elements]], and an atom can be further divided into [[subatomic particle]]s (these levels are outside the scope of biological organization). Each level can also be broken down into its own hierarchy, and specific types of these biological objects can have their own hierarchical scheme. For example, [[genome]]s can be further subdivided into a hierarchy of [[gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level in the hierarchy can be described by its lower levels. For example, the organism may be described at any of its component levels, including the atomic, molecular, cellular, histological (tissue), organ and organ system levels. Furthermore, at every level of the hierarchy, new functions necessary for the control of life appear. These new roles are not functions that the lower level components are capable of and are thus referred to as ''[[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent properties]]''.

Every organism is organised, though not necessarily to the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postlethwait|Hopson|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism can not be organised at the [[histological]] (tissue) level if it is not composed of tissues in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Witzany | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Biological Self-organization | url = | journal = International Journal of Signs and Semiotic Systems | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
Empirically, a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems we observe in nature exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity. [[Systems theory|System]] hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the empirical foundations for a [[Branches of science|field]] that would be, from the 1980s, '''hierarchical ecology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margalef|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wicken|Ulanowicz|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pumain|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|Jørgensen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical foundations are summarized by thermodynamics.
When [[biological systems]] are modeled as [[physical system]]s, in its most general abstraction, they are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|thermodynamic open systems]] that exhibit [[self-organization|self-organised]] behavior, and the [[Set theory|set/subset]] relations between [[dissipative structures]] can be characterized in a hierarchy.

A simpler and more direct way to explain the fundamentals of the "hierarchical organization of life", was introduced in [[Ecology]] by [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]] and others as the "[[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]'s hierarchical principle";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|1969|pp=192–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon&lt;ref&gt;Simon's texts at {{doi|10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_4}}, [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705161014/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html |date=July 5, 2015 }} or [http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ johncarlosbaez/2011/08/29 transcriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531145800/https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ |date=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized that hierarchy "''emerges almost inevitably through a wide variety of evolutionary processes, for the simple reason that &lt;u&gt;hierarchical structures are stable&lt;/u&gt;''".

To motivate this deep idea, he offered his "parable" about imaginary watchmakers.

:{|
!Parable of the Watchmakers
|-
|
There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang frequently; new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?

The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to put down a partly assembled watch (for instance, to answer the phone), it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements.

Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten components each. Ten of these subassemblies could be put together to make a larger sub-assembly. Finally, ten of the larger subassemblies constituted the whole watch. Each subassembly could be put down without falling apart.

'''Cephalo-pelvic disproportion''' exists when the capacity of the pelvis is inadequate to allow the fetus to negotiate the birth canal. This may be due to a small pelvis, a [[Pelvis|nongynecoid pelvic formation]], a large fetus, an unfavorable orientation of the fetus, or a combination of these factors. Certain medical conditions may distort pelvic bones, such as [[rickets]] or a pelvic [[fracture]], and lead to CPD.

Transverse diagonal measurement has been proposed as a predictive method.&lt;ref name="pmid10955423"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liselele HB, Boulvain M, Tshibangu KC, Meuris S |title=Maternal height and external pelvimetry to predict cephalopelvic disproportion in nulliparous African women: a cohort study |journal=BJOG |volume=107 |issue=8 |pages=947–52 |date=August 2000 |pmid=10955423 |doi= 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2000.tb10394.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=1470-0328&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=107&amp;issue=8&amp;spage=947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
A large fetus can be one case of CPD. A large fetus can be caused by [[gestational diabetes]], [[postterm pregnancy]], genetic factors, and [[Gravidity and parity|multiparity]].

The shape of the pelvis can also be a cause of CPD. The pelvis may be too small, or the shape of the pelvis may be malformed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanpregnancy.org/labor-and-birth/cephalopelvic-disproportion/|title=Cephalopelvic Disproportion (CPD): Causes and Diagnosis|website=American Pregnancy Association|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter women are more likely to suffer from CPD&lt;ref name="pmid10955423"/&gt; as are adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKenry|first=Patrick C.|last2=Walters|first2=Lynda Henley|last3=Johnson|first3=Carolyn|date=1979-01-01|title=Adolescent Pregnancy: A Review of the Literature|jstor=583263|journal=The Family Coordinator|volume=28|issue=1|pages=17–28|doi=10.2307/583263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of CPD may be made when there is [[Prolonged labour|failure to progress]], but not all cases of prolonged labour are the result of CPD. Use of ultrasound to measure the size of the fetus in the womb is controversial, as these methods are often inaccurate and may lead to unnecessary [[Caesarean section|caesarian section]]; a trial of labour is often recommended even if size of the fetus is estimated to be large.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Theoretically, [[pelvimetry]] may identify cephalo-pelvic disproportion. However, a woman's pelvis loosens up before birth (with the help of hormones). A [[Cochrane review]] in 2017 found that there was too little evidence to show whether pelvimetry is beneficial and safe when the baby is in [[cephalic presentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pelvimetry for fetal cephalic presentations at or near term for deciding on mode of delivery|url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD000161/PREG_pelvimetry-fetal-cephalic-presentations-or-near-term-deciding-mode-delivery|date=2017-03-30|author=Pattinson R, Cuthbert A, Vannevel V|website=[[Cochrane collaboration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in 2003 came to the conclusion that pelvimetry does not change the management of pregnant women, and recommended that all women should be allowed a trial of labor regardless of pelvimetry results.&lt;ref name="Blackadar2004"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Blackadar CS, Viera AJ| title=A retrospective review of performance and utility of routine clinical pelvimetry. | journal=Fam Med | year= 2004 | volume= 36 | issue= 7 | pages= 505-7 | pmid=15243832 | doi= | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=15243832  }} &lt;/ref&gt; It considered routine performance of pelvimetry to be a waste of time, a potential liability, and an unnecessary discomfort.&lt;ref name="Blackadar2004"/&gt;

== Treatment ==
In the case of a fetus being too large, some obstetricians recommend [[Labor induction|induction of labour]] for earlier delivery. Diagnosis of CPD in active labour will usually result in a [[Caesarean section|Caesarian section.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18273">'''Charles Duncombe''' (28 July 1792 &amp;ndash; 1 October 1867) was a leader in the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] in 1837 and subsequent [[Patriot War]]. He was an active [[The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)|Reform politician]] in the 1830s, and produced several important legislative reports on banking, lunatic asylums, and education.

== Early life ==
He was the eldest son of Thomas and Rhoda Tyrill Duncombe, born July 28, 1792 in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. He studied medicine at the college of the One Hundred and One Members of the Medical Society of the City of New York, graduating in 1819. He then settled in [[Delaware, Ontario|Delaware, Upper Canada]], and in 1824 he established the first medical school in Upper Canada with Dr [[John Rolph (politician)|John Rolph]], in [[St. Thomas, Ontario|St. Thomas]], under the patronage of Colonel [[Thomas Talbot (Upper Canada)|Thomas Talbot]].

== Freemasonry ==
Debates within Upper Canada on the nature of the relationship of the provincial Grand Lodge and the English Grand Lodge paralleled political discussions on the colony's constitution. Those Freemasons who immigrated from the United States favoured an independent Provincial Grand Lodge. Duncombe was a [[Freemason]], serving as first master of the Mount Moriah lodge at Westminster. In 1836, in a move that presaged the Rebellion, he set up a Grand Lodge independent from the British lodges and became its first Grand Master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=J. Ross|title=The History of Freemasonry in Canada Vol. 1|year=1899|publisher=Hunter Rose Co|location=Toronto|pages=390–410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duncombe's Grand Lodge was short-lived, but he soon helped found another during the [[Patriot War]] that followed the [[Upper Canada Rebellion|Rebellion]]: the [[Hunters' Lodges|Hunters' Lodge]]. The Hunters' Lodge was patterned on Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinchen|first=Oscar A.|title=The Rise and Fall of the Patriot Hunters|year=1956|publisher=Bookman Associates|location=New York|pages=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last known Masonic activity was to establish a Masonic lodge in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] in 1852.

== Reform politics ==

=== Upper Canada Legislature ===
{{main|The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)}}
Duncombe was elected in 1828 to the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada|Legislative Assembly]] as a representative for Oxford County. He was originally a Reformer in the same vein as [[Robert Baldwin]], but was attracted by [[William Lyon Mackenzie]]'s more [[The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)|radical reform movement]].

In 1836, Duncombe made extensive reports to a parliamentary committee of reformers on prisons, asylums and education based on an extensive tour of American facilities. In his report on prisons, Duncombe argued crime was the result of social injustice, and not just the product of individual error. He argued that government had the responsibility to not merely punish the offender, but to rectify the social conditions that produced the offender. This, he argued, was particularly true for juvenile offenders. He viewed penitentiaries as "schools for criminals" and sought their eradication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=Peter|title="Terror to Evil-Doers": Prisons and Punishments in Nineteenth-Century Ontario|year=1998|publisher=The Osgoode Society/University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=129–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Doctor Charles Duncombe's Report upon the Subject of Education, made to the Parliament of Upper Canada, 25th February, 1836." called for a radical expansion of common school education in the province. He rejected the [[grammar school]] model pursued by the [[Family Compact]] and argued for practical education; the classics were of limited use in the real world for which education should kill students. A bill based on Duncombe's report passed the assembly on 4 April 1836, only to be rejected by the Family Compact dominated Legislative Council. Many of its provisions, however, would be introduced under after the Rebellion including elective school boards, female education, creation of normal schools, prescribed textbooks, and non-sectarian religious instruction.

The 1836 provincial elections were marked by widespread violence by the Orange Order, and claims of voter fraud. The Lt. Governor, Sir [[Francis Bond Head]] was in charge of the elections but intervened directly in favour of the Tories in the campaign. The Reformers complained that he issued illegal land patents to new immigrants to entice them to vote for Tory candidates. When the new Tory dominated Assembly refused to hear their petition, Duncombe was charged with presenting it to the British government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Craig|first=Gerald M.|title=Upper Canada: The Formative Years 1784-1841|year=1963|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|location=Toronto|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He travelled to London, England in the summer of 1836 but was refused an audience by the Colonial Office. Duncombe was all the more disillusioned when his 14-year-old son was killed before his return in November. Like [[Samuel Lount]], his fellow reform Assemblyman and  rebellion organizer, he virtually withdrew from public life in 1837.

=== Rebellion &amp; Hunters' Lodges ===
{{Campaignbox Upper Canada Rebellion}}
{{main|Upper Canada Rebellion|Patriot War}}
In December 1837, Duncombe heard reports of Mackenzie's rebellion in [[Toronto]]. Duncombe, with [[Robert Alway]], Finlay Malcolm, Eliakim Malcolm, [[Enoch Moore (loyalist turned rebel)|Enoch Moore]] and [[Joshua Gwillen Doan|Joshua Doan]], gathered about 200 men on 8 December and marched towards Toronto; this is sometimes known as the '''Western Rising'''. A few hundred more rebels joined them on their march, but they dispersed near [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] on December 13 when they learned of Mackenzie's defeat, and that a militia under Colonel [[Allan MacNab]] was on their way to stop them. Duncombe and Eliakim Malcolm fled to the United States. Duncombe was a central organizer of the [[Hunters' Lodges|Hunters' Lodge]], a secret Masonic-like military organization with its Grand Lodge in Cleveland. This organization inducted more than 40,000 men into lodges spread across the Great Lakes and St Lawrence region. They launched the [[Patriot War]] in 1838-39, almost bringing the United States and the United Kingdom to war. The organization also declared a provisional Republic of Canada at a convention in Cleveland in September 1838, at which Duncombe established a Republican Bank of Canada to finance the war.&lt;ref name="Kinchen 1956 37–8, 133–5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinchen|first=Oscar|title=The Rise and Fall of the Patriot Hunters|year=1956|publisher=Bookman Associates|location=New York|pages=37–8, 133–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Duncombe remained there for the rest of his life, despite being pardoned in 1843. Joshua Doan was executed in 1839.

=== The Story of His Escape ===
      Main Article: The History of the County Brant, 1883, p.&amp;nbsp;395
Local History of Burford Township Ontario speaks of Dr. Charles Duncombe and his escape from Canada. A writer was able to give it from the statement of the gentleman who, by his intrepidity and knowledge of the Western part of the Ontario frontier, aided an escape and which recalls those of some of Scott's Jacobite heroes a century before. Charles Tilden, Uncle of Dr. Hagel of Toronto, Ontario, was, with several of the Hagel family among the Scotland insurgents. Living near Amherstberg, he happened to be specially well acquainted with the entire western frontier, and noticed that although Sir Francis Head's agents had placed guards all along the line to prevent the escape of "rebels", now that a month had passed from the first excitement, the vigilance was much relaxed. Tilden went to see Duncombe, who, in the depth of winter (January, 1838, was a specially cold season), was kept hid in a hay-loft, and supplied with food by stealth by those who left the house as if to feed the cattle. Tilden urged him to attempt escape disguised as a woman, which Duncombe's smooth round face rendered it possible enough. The attempt was dangerous; a reward had been offered for his head, and all over the country the noble savages of the Grand River reserve were on the lookout for his scalp and the blood-money it would bring. They left the house next day in an old-fashioned farmers box sleigh.  Tilden drove, Mrs. Shennick and Duncombe sat side by side, the latter disguised as an elderly farmer's wife. Mrs. Shennick's little girl, a child of nine years, was taught to address him as "Auntie". All day they drove along without molestation; at night they stopped at a country hotel, where there not being sufficient accommodation, Charles Tilden had to sleep in another a room for the hotel staff, while the three women had a room to themselves. Unable to sleep from the excitement of his position, Dr. Duncombe sat up all night. At early dawn they drove away breakfastless, and arrived after several hours' drive at the crossing place, which was at a village opposite what is now Marine City, Michigan. They drove into the yard of the tavern where were the soldiers of a party in command of a sergeant, posted there to watch the crossing place, and if possible arrest the "rebel Chief". Very calmly Tilden watered his horses, and then addressing the sergeant in command as "Captain", asked if the ice was safe. The sergeant asked whence he came. Tilden replied, truly enough, that he came from London, and he was going with his Aunt and Mother to visit some friends, whose names he mentioned, on the opposite coast of Michigan. The sergeant ordered one of his men to accompany them across the ice.  Then they get half way for the rest of the river, the young soldier said that they could easily find their way for the rest of the track, and was about to leave them. Dr. Duncombe handed Charles Tilden fifty cents for the soldier, and while the latter was thanking them, felt very much inclined to send Dr. Duncombe's compliments to the sergeant who had furnished them with a guide, but refrained lest he should spoil the chance of some other unfortunate who might try the same stratagem for evading the blood-hounds of the Family Compact Government. In a few minutes he stood "a free man" on a free soil." They entered a store to buy some food, and Duncombe careless about preserving his disguise soon attracted attention.  It became known that the Canadian Republican, Dr. Duncombe, a crowd gathered. He escaped capture, which in those days would have been certain death. He had a long and prosperous career in the U.S. lay before him. He was included in the general amnesty, and his Buford property was restored to him. Charles Tilden's son lived in possession of a farm of two hundred acres which Dr. Duncombe deeded to him as an acknowledgment of his father's generous friendship.&lt;ref&gt;The History of the County Brant, 1883, p.395. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MAKING PUMPS AT KOMOKA FOR ABOUT 70 YEARS Charles N.D Tilden, in 94th Year, Tells of Early Manufacturing CONTENDS WOODEN PUMP BETTER THAN METAL ONE Recalls Father Having Aided Rebel Leader To Escape At Detriot, By Myrtle E. Home, London Free Press, October 13, 1928&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Duncombe was the first known physician in Sacramento, California practicing medicine in 1851. He would later be elected to State Legislature in 1858, but was denied a seat  for not being a citizen. He was elected the following year but was denied a seat. It was in 1862 he became a citizen, he took his place in the State Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Charles Duncombe (B-16-32) Pioneer, Patriot, and Traitor by John Bettencourt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcitycemetery.com/charlesduncombe.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free Banking ===
Until 1835, all banks in Upper Canada required a legislative charter; this left them subject to political corruption and manipulation, as was the case with the largest of them, the [[Bank of Upper Canada]]. The Bank of Upper Canada was controlled by the [[Family Compact]] and used by them to control the province's money supply and trade. Reformers tried several legislative strategies, including attempts to incorporate credit unions such as the [[Farmers' Storehouse Company|Farmers' Storehouse company]]. This came to an end in 1835 when Charles Duncombe produced a "Report on Currency" for the Legislative Assembly which demonstrated the legality of the Scottish [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock bank system]] in Upper Canada.

The difference between the English [[Chartered company|chartered banks]] and the Scottish joint stock banks is that the Scottish banks were considered partnerships and hence didn't need a legislated Act in order to operate.  The joint stock banks thus lacked [[limited liability]], and every partner in the bank was responsible for the bank's debts to the full extent of their personal property. The chartered banks, in contrast, protected their shareholders with [[limited liability]] and hence from major loss; they thus encouraged speculation. The Scottish joint-stock banks followed a "[[hard money policy]]." They avoided speculative risk because if they failed, their shareholders were responsible for the full loss. Since the banks did not require a legislated charter, many more banks could be founded, and they were more competitive and freer from political influence and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=Union is Strength: W.L. Mackenzie, the Children of Peace and the Emergence of Joint Stock Democracy in Upper Canada|year=2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=154–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Duncombe's report, the Farmers' Bank and the [[Bank of the People]] were founded on a joint stock basis, until the Family Compact conspired to make them illegal in 1838. The Bank of the People funded [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] newspaper, ''The Constitution'' in 1836.

Similar issues existed in the United States where the chartered banks were accused of creating a "monied aristocracy" responsible for the financial panic of 1837-8. The Equal Rights Party (the [[Locofocos]]) called for the introduction of the Scottish system, called by them "[[Free Banking]]". The Patriot War has been described as "Locofocoism with a Gun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonthius|first=Andrew|title=The Patriot War of 1837-1838: Locofocoism with a Gun?|journal=Labour/Le Travail|year=2003|volume=52|pages=9–43|doi=10.2307/25149383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Hunters' Lodges held their convention in Cleveland in September 1838, Duncombe presented "An address to the Different Lodges on the Subject of a Joint-Stock Company Bank" in which he proposed financing the Patriot War with a republican bank. The Bank was established for a short period.&lt;ref name="Kinchen 1956 37–8, 133–5"/&gt;

Duncombe continued to pursue the idea of joint stock banking after the end of the Patriot War, publishing a lengthy book on the subject: ''[https://archive.org/details/duncombesfreeban00duncrich Duncombe’s Free Banking: An essay on Banking, Currency, Finance, Exchanges and Political Economy]'' (Cleveland: Sanford &amp; Co., 1841). In it, he argued that a democratic state depended upon Free Banking.

=== California State Assembly ===
[[File:Birds-eye view of Sacramento 1857.jpg|thumb|300px|Birds-eye view of Sacramento, ca. 1857]]
After his activity in the Patriot War, Duncombe moved from Cleveland to Rochester, in 1841. He practised medicine there until he  moved to [[Sacramento County, California]] in 1849 at the beginning of the [[California Gold Rush]]. Although one of the first doctors to arrive in Sacramento, he did not qualify to practise in the state until 1851. He married Lucy Millard of California in 1857.  He was elected to the Sacramento city council.&lt;ref name="Willis 1913 126"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willis|first=William|title=History of Sacramento County|year=1913|publisher=Historic Record Company|location=Los Angeles|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, he was elected to the [[California State Assembly]] as one of four members from Sacramento County, but was disqualified because it was argued that he gave up his American citizenship when he allowed himself to be elected to a foreign (Canadian) legislature.  He became an American citizen and was elected again in 1863 as one of the county's five representatives.&lt;ref name="Willis 1913 126"/&gt; He died in Hicksville, California in 1867 after a severe case of [[sunstroke]] and buried in the Masonic Section of the [[Sacramento Historic City Cemetery]] in [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref name="burial"&gt;{{cite web| title=Sacramento Historic City Cemetery Burial Index| publisher=Old City Cemetery Committee| url=http://www.oldcitycemetery.com/images/PDF/CemeteryIndex.pdf| year=2005| accessdate=April 6, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626173633/http://www.oldcitycemetery.com/images/PDF/CemeteryIndex.pdf#| archive-date=2011-06-26| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2644">'''Conrad I''' (died 18 February 1159) was the [[Duke of Merania]] from 1152 until his death. Thitherto he had been the [[vogt|advocate]] of St Andreas at [[Freising]] since 1150 and [[Count of Dachau]] (as '''Conrad II''') from 1152.

==Origin==
Conrad was the elder of two sons of [[Conrad I of Dachau]], a member of the [[House of Wittelsbach]]. His younger brother was Arnold III. of Dachau. Their father Conrad I of Dachau was a son of Arnold I. of [[Scheyern]], who was the youngest son of [[Otto I, Count of Scheyern]].

==Life==
Conrad inherited Dachau from his father and lands in Dalmatia which had formerly been the [[March of Carniola]] from his mother, Willibirg, who had inherited them from Adelaide, daughter of [[Poppo II of Carniola]]. Conrad married Adelaide, daughter of [[Henry, Duke of Lower Lorraine]], sometime before 1140. They had no children and Conrad remarried after her death (before 1146). His second wife, Matilda of Falkenstein, gave him one son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Merania|Conrad II]], who inherited Merania and, in 1172, Dachau.

Conrad was in [[Bamberg]] in February 1152, when King [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] died there. In late June or early July 1152, the [[Emperor Frederick I|Frederick I]] granted Conrad the title of duke for his lands around the [[Kvarner Gulf]], possibly as a reward for helping Frederick secure the throne after the king's death. He used the title ''dux Meranus'' to refer to his coastal territory, but Bishop [[Otto I of Freising]], in his history of Frederick's reign, calls him "Duke of Dalmatia and Croatia".&lt;ref&gt;John B. Freed (2016), ''Frederick Barbarossa: The Prince and the Myth'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; He was also sometimes called "Duke of Dachau", but he was still officially a count there.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Arnold (1991), ''Princes and Territories in Medieval Germany'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1156, Conrad gave Dachau to his younger brother [[Arnold of Dachau|Arnold]]. Conrad died in battle at [[Bergamo]] and was buried in [[Scheyern]].

[[Image:DeadParrot.png|right|thumb|300px|Mr Praline ([[John Cleese]]) (right) attempts to return his dead Norwegian Blue parrot to the shopkeeper ([[Michael Palin]])]]

The "'''Dead Parrot Sketch'''", alternatively and originally known as the "'''Pet Shop Sketch'''" or "'''Parrot Sketch'''", is a [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. It was written by [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]] and initially performed in the show's first series, in the eighth episode ("Full Frontal Nudity", which first aired 7 December 1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus: All the Words, Volume One | first1 = Graham | last1 = Chapman | first2 = John | last2 = Cleese | first3 = Terry | last3 = Gilliam | first4 = Eric | last4 = Idle | first5 = Terry | last5 = Jones | first6 = Michael | last6 = Palin | editor-first = Roger | editor-last = Wilmut | year = 1989 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-679-72647-0 | page = 320 (Appendix)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sketch portrays a conflict between disgruntled customer [[Mr Praline]] (played by Cleese) and a shopkeeper ([[Michael Palin]]), who argue whether or not a recently purchased "Norwegian Blue" [[parrot]] is dead. It pokes fun at the many [[euphemism]]s for death used in [[British culture]].

The "Dead Parrot" sketch was inspired by a "Car Salesman" sketch that Palin and Chapman had done in ''[[How to Irritate People]]''. In it, Palin played a [[car salesman]] who repeatedly refused to admit that there was anything wrong with his customer's (Chapman) car, even as it fell apart in front of him. That sketch was based on an actual incident between Palin and a car salesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The First 28&lt;s&gt;0&lt;/s&gt; Years of Monty Python |last=Johnson |first=Kim "Howard" |year=1999 |location=New York |publisher=Thomas Dunne Books |isbn=0-312-16933-7|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Monty Python Live at Aspen]]'', Palin said that this salesman "had an excuse for everything". John Cleese said on the same show that he and Chapman "believed that there was something very funny there, if we could find the right context for it". In early drafts of what would become the Dead Parrot Sketch, the frustrated customer was trying to return a faulty [[toaster]] to a shop. Chapman realised that it needed to be "madder", and came up with the parrot idea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/jman8132/grahmchapman jman8132 at sites.google]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Cleese and Palin have done many versions of the "Dead Parrot" sketch for various television shows, record albums, and live performances. "Dead Parrot" was voted the top [[alternative comedy]] sketch in a [[Radio Times]] poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4052641.stm |title=Python Dead Parrot is top sketch |accessdate=31 March 2007 |date=29 November 2004 |publisher=BBC  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{listen|filename=Parrot sketch.ogg|title=The Dead Parrot sketch performed on ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' in 1969|description=Listen to a clip from the sketch.}}

==Plot==
[[File:Dead Parrot O2 Arena.jpg|thumb|Dead Parrot sketch at [[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]] in 2014]]
Mr. Praline (Cleese) enters the pet shop to register a complaint about the dead Norwegian Blue parrot (parrots are not endemic to [[Norway]]) just as the shopkeeper (Palin) is preparing to close the establishment for lunch. Despite being told that the bird is deceased and that it had been nailed to its perch, the proprietor insists that it is "pining for the [[fjord]]s" or simply "stunned".&lt;ref name=AllTheWords-p104&gt;''All the Words: Volume One''. pp. 104-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the exasperated Praline attempts to wake up the parrot, the shopkeeper tries to make the bird move by hitting the cage, and Praline erupts into a rage after banging "Polly Parrot" on the counter. After listing several euphemisms for death ("is no more", "has ceased to be", "bereft of life, it rests in peace", and "this is an ex-parrot") he is told to go to the pet shop run by the shopkeeper's brother in [[Bolton]] for a refund. That proves difficult, however, as the proprietor of that store (who is really the shopkeeper, save for a fake moustache) claims this is [[Ipswich]], whereas the railway station attendant ([[Terry Jones]]) claims he is actually in Bolton after all.&lt;ref name=AllTheWords-p104/&gt;

Confronting the shopkeeper's "brother" for lying, the shopkeeper claims he was playing a prank on Praline by sending him to Ipswich, which was a [[palindrome]] for Bolton; Praline points out that the shopkeeper was wrong because a palindrome for Bolton would have been "Notlob". 

Just as Praline has decided that "this is getting too silly", Graham Chapman's no-nonsense [[The Colonel (Monty Python)|Colonel]] bursts in and orders the sketch stopped.&lt;ref name=AllTheWords-p104/&gt;

==Variations of the sketch==

In the 1971 film ''[[And Now For Something Completely Different]]'', the sketch ends with the shopkeeper explaining that he always wanted to be a [[lumberjack]] and, ignoring Mr Praline's protests of that being irrelevant, begins singing "[[The Lumberjack Song]]".

The ''[[Monty Python Live at Drury Lane]]'' album features a live version of the sketch, which is slightly different from the TV version. Praline's rant about the deceased parrot includes "He fucking snuffed it!"  Also, the sketch ends with the shopkeeper saying that he has a slug that does talk. Cleese, after a brief pause, says, "Right, I'll have that one, then!" According to Michael Palin's published diary, Palin changed his response in order to throw Cleese off. During this performance something occurs on stage that does not translate into audio, but causes the audience to break into hysterics upon Cleese's follow-up line "Now that's what I call a dead parrot".

The 1976 [[Monty Python Live at City Center]] performance ended with the slug lines, followed by:
:''Shopkeeper'': (long, long pause) ... Do you want to come back to my place?
:''Mr Praline'': I thought you'd never ask.

On the [[Rhino Records]]' compilation ''Dead Parrot Society'', a live performance from ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' in 1976 has Palin cracking up while Cleese declares "Pining for the fjords? What kind of talk is that?" The audience cheers this bit of [[breaking character]], but Palin quickly composes himself and Cleese declares "Now, look! This is nothing to laugh at!" before proceeding with the sketch. This version is included in the book and CD set ''The Best British Stand-Up and Comedy Routines'', along with a transcript of the sketch and the [[Four Yorkshiremen sketch]].

In his appearance on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', Cleese appears as a pirate attempting to take over a spaceship during a "Pigs In Space" sketch. At the end of the sketch, he demands of the smart-mouthed talking parrot on his shoulder, "Do you want to be an ex-parrot?"

In 1989's ''[[The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball]]'', a benefit for [[Amnesty International]], the sketch opens similarly, but ends very differently:
:''Mr Praline'': It's dead, that's what's wrong with it.
:''Shopkeeper'': So it is. 'Ere's your money back and a couple of holiday [[voucher]]s.
:''(audience goes wild)''
:''Mr Praline'': ''(looks completely flabbergasted)'' Well, you can't say [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] hasn't changed some things.

In a 1997 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' performance of the sketch, Cleese added a line to the rant: "Its metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians!" In an interview on NPR's ''[[Fresh Air]]'', Palin attributed an almost dead audience to his seeing guests reverently mouthing the words of the sketch, rather than laughing at it. To end the sketch, Palin asked Cleese, "Do you want to come back to my place?" to which Cleese said, "I thought you'd never ask!"

In his published diary, [[Michael Palin]] recalls that during the filming of ''Monty Python's [[Life of Brian]]'' in [[Tunisia]], [[Spike Milligan]] (who happened to be there on holiday) regaled the Pythons with his own version of the Dead Parrot sketch, but changed "Norwegian Blue" to "Arctic Grey".

In a 2002 interview with [[Michael Parkinson]], John Cleese said that when he and Palin were performing the sketch on [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]], Palin made him laugh by saying, when asked if his slug could talk, "It mutters a bit" instead of "Not really." When Cleese eventually stopped laughing, he couldn't remember where they were in the sketch. He turned to the audience and asked them what the next line was, and people shouted it at him, causing him to wonder, "What is the point of this?" He also says that when he and Palin were asked to do the sketch for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' they sat down together to try to remember the lines, and when they got stuck they considered just going out and stopping somebody on the street to ask how it went, since everybody seemed to have it memorised.

[[Margaret Thatcher]] famously used the sketch in a speech at the [[Conservative Party Conference]] in 1990, referring to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and their symbol being a dove, before ending the speech by commenting, "[[And Now for Something Completely Different|And now for something completely different]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ6TgaPJcR0 |title=Margaret Thatcher does the Dead Parrot Sketch |publisher=YouTube |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' ran the front-page headline "This party is no more...it has ceased to be...this is an EX-party" for an article about a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] conference.

[[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] made a ''[[South Park]]'' version of the sketch depicting [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] angrily returning a dead [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] to [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s shop. Most of the lines are the same in the original sketch. It ends when [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animations play around with Cartman and everything is crushed by the giant foot.

Cleese and Palin acted out the sketch during the Python's reunion in [[The O2]] in July 2014, [[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]]. The sketch ended with the shopkeeper saying he has a selection of cheeses, transitioning into the [[Cheese Shop Sketch]]. The entire sketch ended like the City Centre performance, with the shopkeeper offering Mr Praline to come back to his place, and Mr Praline replying "I thought you'd never ask."
In their final performance on 20 July (which was broadcast live to many theatres all over the world), whilst listing the metaphors for the parrot's death, Cleese added the line "it had expired and gone to meet Dr. [[Graham Chapman|Chapman]]" after which both Cleese and Palin did a thumbs-up to the sky.

In the episode of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' from 13 November 2015, John Cleese is a guest on the show. At the end of the big furry hat segment (where Colbert and in this specific instance Cleese, create nonsensical rules), Cleese says, "Do you want to come back to my place?" and Stephen answers, "I thought you'd never ask."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwH04FeeVlQ&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further uses==
At [[Graham Chapman]]'s memorial service, John Cleese began his [[eulogy]] by reprising euphemisms from the sketch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHk9WC7fnQ | title=Graham Chapman's funeral | medium=Video | date=1989 | people=John Cleese, Eric Idle | location=London, England, United Kingdom | publisher=YouTube | accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 there was a follow up with their ''Live at Aspen'', with the supposed ashes of Chapman. Midway through the interview, [[Terry Gilliam]] put his feet up on the table and knocked the urn off, spilling the ashes and prompting a frantic, [[slapstick]] attempt to clean him up with a dustpan and brush, and subsequently a [[dustbuster]]. 

In an anniversary concert [[Jasper Carrott]] had allowed his fans to pick the material. He opened the performance by announcing this then saying "I've had some funny requests; somebody from Newark wanted me to do the dead parrot sketch". {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Part or all of the dead parrot sketch is quoted in several television programmes, among them the "Life of Python" sketch from ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' (a parody of the ''[[Friday Night, Saturday Morning]]'' debate on ''[[Life of Brian]]'') and "The Early Bird", an episode from the [[List of Death in Paradise episodes#Series 3 (2014)|third season]] of ''[[Death in Paradise (TV series)|Death in Paradise]]''.

==Precedents==
A joke dated {{circa}} AD 400, recently translated from Greek, shows similarities to the Parrot sketch. It was written by Hierocles and Philagrius and was included in a compilation of 265 jokes titled ''[[Philogelos]]: The Laugh Addict''. In the Greek version, a man complains to a slave-merchant that his new slave has died. The slave-merchant replies, "When he was with me, he never did any such thing!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3454319/Dead-Parrot-sketch-is-1600-years-old.html | title = Dead parrot sketch is 1600 years old: It's long been held that the old jokes are the best jokes - and Monty Python's Dead Parrot sketch is no different | first = Stephen | last = Adams | work = The Telegraph | date = 13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mark Twain]]'s humorous short story "A Nevada Funeral", two characters use a series of [[euphemism]]s for death including '[[Kick the bucket|kicked the bucket]]' and 'departed to that mysterious country from whose bourne no traveller returns'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mark | last = Twain | author-link = Mark Twain | title = A Nevada Funeral  | work = North Otago Times | volume = XVIII | issue = 825 | page = 4 | date = 18 April 1873 | url = http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NOT18730418.2.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, [[Tony Hancock]] and [[Sid James]] performed a similar sketch involving a dead tortoise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/arcarti/hancock-tortoise-1959 |title= Hancock tortoise 1959 |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, [[Benny Hill]] performed a sketch entitled "The Taxidermist" (written by [[Dave Freeman (British writer)|Dave Freeman]]) on ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'' in which he attempted to pass off a stuffed duck as a parrot (blaming its different appearance on "the steaming" and "the shrinkage"). [[John Cleese]] later admitted that he watched Hill's show during this period, but didn't recall this particular piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewisohn|first1=Mark|title=Funny Peculiar: The True Story of Benny Hill|date=2002|publisher=Sidgwick &amp; Jackson|location=London|isbn=0-330-39340-5|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s [[Freddie Davies|Freddie "Parrot Face" Davies]] included an obviously stuffed caged parrot as part of his stage routine, occasionally complaining that he had been swindled by the seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pm7zk |title= Blackpool: Big Night Out |publisher=BBC |date=6 January 2013 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar|state=collapsed}}
In human [[social behavior|social affairs]], '''discrimination''' is treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction towards, a person based on the group, class, or category to which the person is perceived to belong.

Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and [[institution]]s in every part of the world, including in territories where discrimination is generally looked down upon. In some places, controversial attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination—but they have sometimes been called [[reverse discrimination]].

==Etymology==
The term ''discriminate'' appeared in the early 17th century in the English language. It is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''discriminat-'' 'distinguished between', from the verb ''discriminare'', from ''discrimen'' 'distinction', from the verb ''discernere''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of discrimination; Origin|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/discriminate?q=discriminate|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the [[American Civil War]] the term "discrimination" generally evolved in [[American English]] usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable [[Social group|group]] or social category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Introduction to sociology |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc. |year=2009 |edition=7th |location=New York |page=324 |medium=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Discrimination" derives from Latin, where the verb ''discrimire'' means "to separate, to distinguish, to make a distinction".

==Definitions==
Moral philosophers have defined discrimination as ''disadvantageous'' treatment or consideration. This is a comparative definition. An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against. They just need to be treated ''worse'' than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to black children out of a racist attitude, then they would be acting in a discriminatory way despite the fact that the people they discriminate against actually benefit by receiving a donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lippert-Rasmussen |first=Kasper |year=2006 |title=Private Discrimination: A Prioritarian, Desert-Accommodating Account |journal=San Diego Law Review |volume=43 |pages=817–856}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1755-2567.2010.01080.x|title = Discrimination in Terms of Moral Exclusion| journal=Theoria| volume=76| issue=4| pages=314–332|year = 2010|last1 = Horta|first1 = Oscar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this discrimination develops into a source of oppression. It is similar to the action of recognizing someone as 'different' so much that they are treated inhumanly and degraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nVIJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;q=equality|title=Anti-Discriminatory Practice: Equality, Diversity and Social Justice|last=Thompson|first=Neil|date=2016-05-12|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137586667|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Realistic competition'' is driven by self-interest and is aimed at obtaining material resources (e.g., food, territory, customers) for the in-group (e.g., favouring an in-group in order to obtain more resources for its members, including the self).
# ''Social competition'' is driven by the need for self-esteem and is aimed at achieving a positive social status for the in-group relative to comparable out-groups (e.g., favouring an in-group in order to make it better than an out-group).
# ''Consensual discrimination'' is driven by the need for accuracy{{clarify|date=February 2012}} and reflects stable and legitimate intergroup status hierarchies (e.g., favouring a high-status in-group because it is high status).

The [[United Nations]] stance on discrimination includes the statement:  "Discriminatory behaviors take many forms, but they all involve some form of exclusion or rejection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/discrim/id_8_ud_print.asp |title=United Nations CyberSchoolBus: What is discrimination? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601211521/http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/discrim/id_8_ud_print.asp |archivedate=2014-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; International bodies [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] work towards helping ending discrimination around the world.

==Types==

===Age===
{{Main|Ageism|Adultism}}
Ageism or age discrimination is discrimination and stereotyping based on the grounds of someone's age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Ageism|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ageism?q=ageism|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a set of beliefs, norms, and values which used to justify discrimination or subordination based on a person's age.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickKatsiaficas1987"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=George R.|last2=Katsiaficas|first2=George N.|last3=Kirkpatrick|first3=Robert George|author4=Mary Lou Emery|title=Introduction to critical sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdf2QupEaHgC&amp;pg=PA261|accessdate=28 January 2011|year=1987|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=978-0-8290-1595-9|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ageism is most often directed towards old people, or adolescents and children.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson J and Ferraro K, Thirty Years of Ageism Research. In Nelson T (ed). Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice Against Older Persons. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php "Young and Oppressed"]. youthrights.org.

Age discrimination in hiring has been shown to exist in the United States.  Joanna Lahey, professor at The Bush School of Government and Public Service at [[Texas A&amp;M]], found that firms are more than 40% more likely to interview a young adult job applicant than an older job applicant.&lt;ref&gt;Lahey, J. (2005) [https://ideas.repec.org/p/crr/issbrf/ib33.html Do Older Workers Face Discrimination?] Boston College. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414230847/https://ideas.repec.org/p/crr/issbrf/ib33.html |date=April 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, Stijn Baert, Jennifer Norga, Yannick Thuy and Marieke Van Hecke, researchers at [[Ghent University]], measured comparable ratios in Belgium. They found that age discrimination is heterogeneous by the activity older candidates undertook during their additional post-educational years. In Belgium, they are only discriminated if they have more years of inactivity or irrelevant employment.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, S., Norga, J., Thuy, Y., Van Hecke, M.

In a survey for the [[University of Kent]], England, 29% of respondents stated that they had suffered from age discrimination.  This is a higher proportion than for [[Sexism|gender]] or [[Racism|racial]] discrimination. [[Dominic Abrams]], social psychology professor at the university, concluded that ageism is the most pervasive form of prejudice experienced in the UK population.&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/media/how_ageist_is_britain.pdf How Ageist is Britain?] London: Age Concern. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027165812/http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/media/how_ageist_is_britain.pdf |date=October 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caste===
{{See also|Caste}}

According to [[UNICEF]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], [[caste]] discrimination affects an estimated 250 million people worldwide.&lt;ref name="unicef 1"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_discrimination.html Discrimination], UNICEF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/08/29/global1815.htm|title=Global Caste Discrimination|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newint.org/issue380/facts.htm Caste - The Facts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811033342/http://www.newint.org/issue380/facts.htm |date=August 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination based on caste, as perceived by [[UNICEF]], is mainly prevalent in parts of [[Asia]], ([[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Japan]]), [[Africa]] and others.&lt;ref name="unicef 1"/&gt; {{As of|2011}}, there were 200 million [[Dalit]]s or [[Scheduled Castes]] (formerly known as "untouchables") in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idsn.org/news-resources/idsn-news/read/article/india-official-dalit-population-exceeds-200-million/128/|title=India: Official Dalit population exceeds 200 million|date=29 May 2013|publisher=International Dalit Solidarity Network|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability===
{{Main|Disability discrimination}}

Discrimination against people with [[Disability|disabilities]] in favor of people who are not is called [[ableism]] or [[disablism]]. Disability discrimination, which treats non-disabled individuals as the standard of 'normal living', results in public and private places and services, education, and social work that are built to serve 'standard' people, thereby excluding those with various disabilities. Studies have shown, employment is needed to not only provide a living but to sustain mental health and well-being. Work fulfils a number of basic needs for an individual such as collective purpose, social contact, status, and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vornholt|first=Katharina|author2=Sjir Uitdewilligen |author3=Frans J.N. Nijhuis |title=Factors Affecting the Acceptance of People with Disabilities at Work: A Literature Review|journal=Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation|date=December 2013|volume=23|issue=4|pages=463–75|doi=10.1007/s10926-013-9426-0|pmid=23400588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person with a disability is often found to be socially isolated and work is one way to reduce isolation.

In the United States, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] mandates the provision of equality of access to both buildings and services and is paralleled by similar acts in other countries, such as the [[Equality Act 2010]] in the UK.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Language===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
{{Main|Linguistic discrimination}}
[[File:Corsican nationalism.jpg|thumb|Nationalists in [[Corsica]] sometimes spray-paint or shoot traffic signs in [[French language|French]].]]
Diversity of language is protected and respected by most nations who value cultural diversity.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} However, people are sometimes subjected to different treatment because their preferred language is associated with a particular group, class or category. Notable examples are the [[Anti-French sentiment in the United States]] as well as the [[Anti-Quebec sentiment]] in Canada targeting people who speak the French language. Commonly, the preferred language is just another attribute of separate [[ethnic group]]s.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} Discrimination exists if there is prejudicial treatment against a person or a group of people who either do or do not speak a particular language or languages.

Another noteworthy example of linguistic discrimination is the backdrop to the [[Bengali language movement|Bengali Language Movement]] in erstwhile Pakistan, a political campaign that played a key role in the creation of [[Bangladesh]]. In 1948, [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] declared [[Urdu]] as the national language of [[Pakistan]] and branded those supporting the use of [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the most widely spoken language in the state, as enemies of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[1971 Bangladesh genocide#CITEREFHossainTollefson2006|Hossain &amp; Tollefson 2006]], p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language discrimination is suggested to be labeled '''[[linguicism]]''' or '''logocism'''.{{by whom|date=January 2012}} Anti-discriminatory and inclusive efforts to accommodate persons who speak different languages or cannot have fluency in the country's predominant or "official" language, is [[bilingualism]] such as official documents in two languages, and [[multiculturalism]] in more than two languages.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Name===
Discrimination based on a person's name may also occur, with research suggesting the presence of discrimination based on name meaning, pronunciation, uniqueness, gender affiliation, and racial affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Silberzhan | first1 =Raphael | title =It Pays to be Herr Kaiser | journal =Psychological Science | volume =24 | issue =12 | pages =2437–2444 | date =May 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Laham | first =Simon | title =The name-pronunciation effect: Why people like Mr. Smith more than Mr. Colquhoun | journal =Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume=48 | issue =2012 | pages =752–756 | date =December 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Cotton | first =John  | title =The "name game": affective and hiring reactions to first names | journal =Journal of Managerial Psychology | volume =23 | issue =1 | pages =18–39 | date =July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Bertrand | first =Marianne | title =Are Emily and Brendan More Employable than Lakisha and Jamaal? | journal =The American Economic Review | volume =94 | issue =4 | pages =991–1013 |  date =September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Easton | first=Stephen | title=Blind recruiting study suggests positive discrimination common in the APS | newspaper=The Mandarin | publisher=The Mandarin | date=June 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has further shown that real world recruiters spend an average of just six seconds reviewing each résumé before making their initial "fit/no fit" screen-out decision and that a person's name is one of the six things they focus on most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith | first =Jacquelyn | title =Here's What Recruiters Look At In The 6 Seconds They Spend On Your Résumé | newspaper =Business Insider | publisher =Business Insider | date =November 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  France has made it illegal to view a person's name on a résumé when screening for the initial list of most qualified candidates.

===Nationality===
Discrimination on the basis of [[nationality]] is usually included in [[Employment discrimination|employment laws]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/discrimination_civil_rights/publication_erd_14009_pweb.htm Race, Color, National Origin and Ancestry], State of Wisconsin {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024061935/http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/discrimination_civil_rights/publication_erd_14009_pweb.htm |date=October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see above [[Discrimination#Employment|section for employment discrimination]] specifically). It is sometimes referred to as bound together with racial discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race and National Origin Discrimination|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/faq/race-origin.html|website=Office for Civil Rights|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be separate. It may vary from laws that stop refusals of hiring based on nationality, asking questions regarding origin, to prohibitions of firing, forced retirement, compensation and pay, etc., based on nationality.

Discrimination on the basis of nationality may show as a "level of acceptance" in a sport or work team regarding new team members and employees who differ from the nationality of the majority of team members.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Schwieren, [http://sgr.sagepub.com/content/39/6/643.abstract Mechanisms Underlying Nationality-Based Discrimination in Teams.

In the [[UAE]] and other [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] states, for instance, nationality is not frequently given to residents and expatriates. In the workplace, preferential treatment is given to full citizens, even though many of them lack experience or motivation to do the job. State benefits are also generally available for citizens only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/emiratisation-wont-work-if-people-dont-want-to-learn|title=Emiratisation won't work if people don't want to learn|author=Ayesha Almazroui|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Region===
{{see also|Regional discrimination in China}}
Regional or geographic discrimination is discrimination based on the region in which a person lives or was born. It differs from national discrimination in that it may not be based on national borders or the country the victim lives in, but is instead based on prejudices against a specific region of one or more countries. Examples include discrimination against Chinese born in countryside far from city within China, and discrimination against [[Americans]] from the [[Southern United States|southern]] or [[Northern United States|northern]] regions of the United States. It is often accompanied by discrimination based on accent, dialect, or cultural differences.&lt;ref name="Accent"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/a/accent-discrimination/ | title=Accent Discrimination Law and Legal Definition|publisher=USLegal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
{{Main|Religious discrimination}}

{{Status of religious freedom}}
[[File:Lotshampa refugees in Beldangi Camp.jpg|thumb|In the 1990s, [[Bhutan]] [[Bhutanese refugees|expelled or forced to leave]] its Hindu population in the name of preserving its Buddhist culture and identity.]]
Religious discrimination is valuing or treating a person or group differently because of what they do or do not believe or because of their feelings towards a given religion. For instance, the indigenous Christian population of the [[Balkans]], known as the "rayah" or the "protected flock", was discriminated against under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Kanun–i–Rayah. The word is sometimes translated as 'cattle' rather than 'flock' or 'subjects' in order to emphasize the Christian population's inferior status to that of the Muslim rayah.&lt;ref&gt;Maan Z. Madina, ''Arabic-English Dictionary of the Modern Literary Language'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;{{explain|Was this "discrimination" only expressed by the meaning of a single word? If so, this can hardly be an illustrative example of religious discrimination and should be replaced with a better example.|date=November 2015}}

Restrictions upon [[Jew]]ish occupations were imposed by Christian authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to religious Jews, pushing them into marginal roles considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and [[moneylending]], occupations only tolerated as a "necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0718_050718_ashkenazim.html Did Discrimination Enhance Intelligence of Jews?]". National Geographic News. July 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghetto]]s and were not allowed to own land.

In a 1979 consultation on the issue, the United States commission on civil rights defined religious discrimination in relation to the civil rights guaranteed by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for [[Freedom of Religion]] (in the United States secured by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied "the equal protection of the laws, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1979: ''Religious discrimination. A neglected issue. A consultation sponsored by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Washington. D.C., April 9–10, 1979''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex, sex characteristics, gender, and gender identity===
{{Main|Sexism}}
{{See also|Misogyny|Misandry|Discrimination against intersex people|Transphobia||Discrimination towards non-binary gender persons}}

Though gender discrimination and sexism refer to beliefs and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] in relation to the [[gender]] of a person, such beliefs and attitudes are of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. '''Sex discrimination''', on the other hand, may have legal consequences. Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature is considered a form of [[prejudice]] and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.

Sexual discrimination can arise in different contexts. For instance, an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or by an [[employer]] not hiring or promoting, unequally paying, or wrongfully terminating, an employee based on their gender. [[Image:OECD gender wage gap.svg|thumb|350px|The gender gap in median earnings of full-time employees according to the [[OECD]] 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[OECD]]|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/57/40846335.pdf|title=OECD Employment Outlook 2008 – Statistical Annex OECD, Paris|year=2008|page=358|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206221033/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/57/40846335.pdf|archivedate= December 6, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] Sexual discrimination can also arise when the dominant group holds a bias against the minority group. One such example is Wikipedia. In the Wikipedian community, around 13 percent of registered users are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Glott, R., Schmidt, P., &amp; Ghosh, R. A.|date=March 2010|title=Wikipedia survey—Overview of results|work=UNI-MERIT| url=http://www.wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414165445/http://wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf|archivedate=April 14, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates gender imbalances, and leaves room for [[systemic bias]]. Women are not only more harshly scrutinized, but the representation of women authors are also overlooked. Relative to men, across all source lists, women have a 2.6 greater odds of omission in Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Reagle, J., &amp; Rhue, L.|year=2011|title=Gender Bias in Wikipedia and Britannica|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=5|pages=1138–1158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an educational setting, there could be claims that a student was excluded from an educational institution, program, opportunity, loan, student group, or scholarship because of their gender. In the housing setting, there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on their gender. Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal loan terms based on one's gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilson, F.|year=2003|title=Organizational Behaviour and Gender|edition=2nd|location=Aldershot|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754609001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with other forms of unlawful discrimination, there are two types of sex discrimination – direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. Direct sex discrimination is fairly easy to spot – 'Barmaid wanted', but indirect sex discrimination, where an unnecessary requirement puts one sex at a disproportionate disadvantage compared to the opposite sex, is sometimes less easy to spot, although some are obvious – 'Bar person wanted – must look good in a mini skirt'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/sex-discrimination|title=Sex Discrimination|website=Citation.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another setting where there is usually gender discrimination is when one is refused to extend their credit, refused approval of credit/loan process, and if there is a burden of unequal loan terms based on one's gender.

Socially, sexual differences have been used to justify [[gender role|different roles for men and women]], in some cases giving rise to claims of primary and secondary roles. While there are alleged non-physical differences between men and women, major reviews of the academic literature on gender difference find only a tiny minority of characteristics where there are consistent psychological differences between men and women, and these relate directly to experiences grounded in biological difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyde | first1 = J.

Gregory, ''Women and Workplace Discrimination: Overcoming Barriers to Gender Equality,'' Piscataway, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] had concluded that women often experience a "[[glass ceiling]]" and that there are no societies in which women enjoy the same opportunities as men.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, ''Glass Ceilings and Open Doors,'' Fordham Law Review,  64.2, 1995, pp.291-449; Carol Hymowitz and Timothy Schellhardt, ''The Glass Ceiling: Why Women Can’t Seem to Break the Invisible Barrier that Blocks them from the Top Jobs,'' The Wall Street Journal, 4, March 24, 1986, pp.10-40&lt;/ref&gt; The term "glass ceiling" is used to describe a perceived barrier to advancement in employment based on discrimination, especially sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bolton, Joe R. Feagin ''Black in Blue: African-American Police Officers and Racism,'' Routledge, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States in 1995, the Glass Ceiling Commission, a government-funded group, stated: "Over half of all Master's degrees are now awarded to women, yet 95% of senior-level managers, of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies are men. Of them, 97% are white." In its report, it recommended [[affirmative action]], which is the consideration of an employee's gender and race in hiring and promotion decisions, as a means to end this form of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Glass Ceiling Commission"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2010}}, women accounted for 51% of workers in high-paying management, professional, and related occupations. They outnumbered men in such occupations as public relations managers, financial managers, and human resource managers.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/QS-womenwork2010.htm Quick Stats on Women Workers, 2010]". [[U.S. Department of Labor]], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], ''Employment and Earnings, 2010 Annual Averages and the Monthly Labor Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, women are found to experience a [[sticky floor]]. While a glass ceiling implies that women are less like to reach the top of the job ladder, a sticky floor is defined as the pattern that women are, compared to men, less likely to start to climb the job ladder. A sticky floor is related to gender differences at the bottom of the wage distribution. It might be explained by both employer discrimination and gender differences in career aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, S., De Pauw, A.-S., Deschacht, N. (Forthcoming) [Do Employer Preferences Contribute to Sticky Floors?] Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intersex]] persons experience [[Discrimination against intersex people|discrimination]] due to innate, atypical [[sex characteristics]]. Multiple jurisdictions now protect individuals on grounds of ''intersex status'' or ''[[sex characteristics]]''. South Africa was the first country to explicitly add intersex to legislation, as part of the attribute of 'sex'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2005-022.pdf Judicial Matters Amendment Act, No. 22 of 2005], Republic of South Africa, Vol. 487, Cape Town, 11 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia was the first country to add an independent attribute, of 'intersex status'.&lt;ref name="expmem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22legislation%2Fems%2Fr5026_ems_1fcd9245-33ff-4b3a-81b9-7fdc7eb91b9b%22 |title=Australian Parliament, Explanatory Memorandum to the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Bill 2013 |publisher= |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219231017/http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p%3Bquery%3DId%3A%22legislation/ems/r5026_ems_1fcd9245-33ff-4b3a-81b9-7fdc7eb91b9b%22 |archivedate=19 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/21774/welcome-senate-inquiry-anti-discrimination/ We welcome the Senate Inquiry report on the Exposure Draft of the Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill 2012], [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]], 21 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Malta was the first to adopt a broader framework of 'sex characteristics', through legislation that also ended modifications to the sex characteristics of minors undertaken for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref name="gate-malta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transactivists.org/2015/04/08/making-depathologization-a-matter-of-law-a-comment-from-gate-on-the-maltese-act-on-gender-identity-gender-expression-and-sex-characteristics/ |title=Making depathologization a matter of law.

[[Transgender]] individuals, whether male-to-female, female-to-male, or [[genderqueer]], often experience [[transphobia|transphobic]] problems that often lead to dismissals, underachievement, difficulty in finding a job, social isolation, and, occasionally, violent attacks against them. 

Nevertheless, the problem of gender discrimination does not stop at transgender individuals or with women. Men are often the victim in certain areas of employment as men begin to seek work in office and childcare settings traditionally perceived as "women's jobs". One such situation seems to be evident in a recent case concerning alleged YMCA discrimination and a Federal Court Case in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;''Noack v YMCA of Greater Houston Area'', 132, S. Ct.425 (US, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The case actually involves alleged discrimination against both men and black people in childcare, even when they pass the same strict background tests and other standards of employment. It is currently being contended in federal court, as of fall 2009.{{Update inline|date=October 2018|reason=The case mentioned has most likely been decided.|?=yes}}

Discrimination in slasher films is relevant. Gloria Cowan had a research group study on 57 different slasher films. Their results showed that the non-surviving females were more frequently sexual than the surviving females and the non-surviving males. Surviving as a female slasher victim was strongly associated with the absence of sexual behavior. In slasher films, the message appears to be that sexual women get killed and only the pure women survive, thus reinforcing the idea that female sexuality can be costly.&lt;ref name=Cowan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowan|first=Glora|author2=O'Brien, Margaret|title=Gender and Survival vs. Death in Slasher Films: A Content Analysis|journal=Sex Roles|year=1990|volume=23|pages=187–196|doi=10.1007/BF00289865|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One's sexual orientation is a "predilection for homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality".&lt;ref&gt;''World English Dictionary'', [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+orientation "Sexual Orientation"]&lt;/ref&gt; Like most minority groups, homosexuals and bisexuals are vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination from the majority group. They may experience hatred from others because of their sexual preferences; a term for such hatred based upon one's sexual orientation is often called [[homophobia]]. Many continue to hold negative feelings towards those with non-heterosexual orientations and will discriminate against people who have them or are thought to have them. People of other uncommon sexual orientations also experience discrimination. One study found its sample of heterosexuals to be more prejudiced against [[asexuality|asexuals]] than to homosexuals or bisexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Intergroup bias toward "Group X": Evidence of prejudice, dehumanization, avoidance, and discrimination against asexuals |first1=Cara C. |last1=MacInnis |first2=Gordon |last2=Hodson |journal=Group Processes Intergroup Relations |doi=10.1177/1368430212442419 |volume=15 |number=6 |pages=725–743 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employment discrimination based on sexual orientation varies by country.

{{further|LGBT rights by country or territory}}
A number of countries, especially those in the [[Western world]], have passed measures to alleviate discrimination against sexual minorities, including laws against anti-gay hate crimes and workplace discrimination. Some have also legalized same-sex marriage or civil unions in order to grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the [[United Nations]] passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights.

In the US, a government policy known as [[affirmative action]] was instituted to encourage employers and universities to seek out and accept groups such as [[African Americans]] and women, who have been subject to discrimination for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography on Race, Gender and Affirmative Action|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~eandersn/biblio.htm |work=Race, Gender, and Affirmative Action|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some attempts at antidiscrimination have been criticized as reverse discrimination. In particular, minority quotas (for example, [[affirmative action]]) may discriminate against members of a dominant or majority group or other minority groups. In its opposition to race preferences, the American Civil Rights Institute's [[Ward Connerly]] stated, "There is nothing positive, affirmative, or equal about 'affirmative action' programs that give preference to some groups based on race."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acri.org/pr_7_25_07.html American Civil Rights Institute | Press Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214072218/http://www.acri.org/pr_7_25_07.html |date=December 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations documents===
Important UN documents addressing discrimination include:
* The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is a declaration adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 10 December 1948. It states that:" ''Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html The Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208080853/http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |date=December 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (ICERD) is a United Nations convention. The Convention commits its members to the elimination of [[racial discrimination]]. The convention was adopted and opened for signature by the United Nations General Assembly on 21 December 1965, and entered into force on 4 January 1969.
* The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW) is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly. Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women, it came into force on 3 September 1981.
* The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] is an international human rights instrument treaty of the United Nations. Parties to the Convention are required to promote, protect, and ensure the full enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities and ensure that they enjoy full equality under the law. The text was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 13 December 2006, and opened for signature on 30 March 2007. Following ratification by the 20th party, it came into force on 3 May 2008.

==Theories==
[[Social theories]] such as [[egalitarianism]] assert that [[social equality]] should prevail. In some societies, including most developed countries, each individual's civil rights include the right to be free from government sponsored social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weblocator.com/attorney/mn/law/concivrig.html#30 |title=Civil rights |accessdate=2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a belief in the capacity to perceive pain or suffering shared by all animals, "abolitionist" or "vegan" egalitarianism maintains that the interests of every individual (regardless its species), warrant [[equal consideration of interests|equal consideration]] with the interests of humans, and that not doing so is "[[speciesist]]".&lt;ref name="singerethics-sentience"&gt;{{cite book |title=Practical Ethics |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |origyear=1993 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-43971-8 |edition=Second |pages=57–58 |chapter=Equality for Animals? |quote=If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. ... This is why the limit of sentience&amp;nbsp;... is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others. ... Similarly those I would call 'speciesists' give greater weight to their own species when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of other species.|title-link=Practical Ethics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labeling theory===
Discrimination, in [[labeling theory]], takes form as mental categorization of minorities and the use of [[stereotype]]. This theory describes difference as deviance from the norm, which results in internal devaluation and [[social stigma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Slattery| first=M. | year=2002 | title=Key Ideas in Sociology | publisher=Nelson Thornes| isbn=978-0-7487-6565-2 | pages=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be seen as discrimination. It is started by describing a "natural" social order. It is distinguished between the fundamental principle of fascism and social democracy.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} The [[Nazis]] in 1930s-era Germany and the pre-1990 [[Apartheid]] government of South Africa used racially discriminatory agendas for their political ends. This practice continues with some present day governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adam|first1=Heribert|title=Anti-Semitism and Anti-Black Racism: Nazi Germany and Apartheid South Africa|journal=Telos|date=1 July 1996|volume=1996|issue=108|pages=25–46|doi=10.3817/0696108025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game theory===
Economist [[Yanis Varoufakis]] (2013) argues that "discrimination based on utterly arbitrary characteristics
evolves quickly and systematically in the experimental laboratory", and that neither classical [[game theory]] nor [[neoclassical economics]] can explain this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 11: Evolving domination in the laboratory

|year=2013
|title=Economic Indeterminacy: A personal encounter with the economists' peculiar nemesis
|series=Routledge Frontiers of Political Economy
|isbn=978-0415668491
|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Varoufakis and Shaun Hargreaves-Heap (2002) ran an experiment where volunteers played a computer-mediated, multiround [[hawk-dove game]] (HD game).  At the start of each session, each participant was assigned a color at random, either red or blue.  At each round, each player learned the color assigned to his or her opponent, but nothing else about the opponent.  Hargreaves-Heap and Varoufakis found that the players' behavior within a session frequently developed a discriminatory convention, giving a [[Nash equilibrium]] where players of one color (the "advantaged" color) [[pure strategy|consistently]] played the aggressive "hawk" strategy against players of the other, "disadvantaged" color, who played the acquiescent "dove" strategy against the advantaged color.  Players of both colors used a [[mixed strategy]] when playing against players assigned the same color as their own.

The experimenters then added a [[prisoners' dilemma|cooperation]] option to the game, and found that disadvantaged players usually cooperated with each other, while advantaged players usually did not.  They state that while the equilibria reached in the original HD game are predicted by [[evolutionary game theory]], game theory does not explain the emergence of cooperation in the disadvantaged group.  Citing earlier psychological work of [[Matthew Rabin]], they hypothesize that a norm of differing entitlements emerges across the two groups, and that this norm could define a "fairness" equilibrium within the disadvantaged group.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]

==State vs. free market==

It is debated as to whether or not [[market (economics)|markets]] discourage discrimination brought about by the state. One argument is that since discrimination restricts access to customers and incurs additional expense, market logic will punish discrimination. Opposition by companies to "Jim Crow" segregation laws is an example of this.&lt;ref name=roback&gt;Jennifer Roback, "The Political Economy of Segregation: The Case of Segregated Streetcars." Journal of Economic History 56, no. 4 (December 1986): 893–917.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative argument is that markets don't necessarily undermine discrimination, as it is argued that if discrimination is profitable by catering to the "tastes" of individuals (which is the point of the market), then the market will not punish discrimination. It is argued that microeconomic analysis of discrimination uses unusual methods to determine its effects (using explicit treatment of production functions) and that the very existence of discrimination in employment (defined as wages which differ from marginal product of the discriminated employees) in the long run contradicts claims that the market will function well and punish discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Toikka, The Welfare Implications of Becker’s Discrimination Coefficient, 13 J. ECON. THEORY 472, 472 (1976);  Glen G. Cain, The Economic Analysis of Labor Market Discrimination: A Survey, in 1 HANDBOOK OF LABOR ECONOMICS 693, 774 (Orley Ashenfelter &amp; Richard Layard eds., 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For review of the literature in regard to the last two points see [http://www.glima.info/pdf/Employment-Discrimination-Paper-final.pdf Menahem Pasternak, Employment Discrimination: Some Economic Definitions, Critique and Legal Implications, 33 N.

'''Do-it-yourself biology''' ('''DIY biology''', '''DIY bio''') is a growing [[biotechnology|biotechnological]] [[social movement]] in which individuals, communities, and small organizations study biology and life science using the same methods as traditional research institutions. DIY biology is primarily undertaken by individuals with extensive research training from academia or corporations, who then mentor and oversee other DIY biologists with little or no formal training. This may be done as a [[hobby]], as a [[not-for-profit]] endeavor for community learning and [[open-science]] [[innovation]], or for profit, to start a [[business]].

==History==
The term "biohacking" as well as the concept of do-it-yourself biology has been known as early as 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Forum: Roses are black, violets are green – The emergence of amateur genetic engineers|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12516984-100-forum-roses-are-black-violets-are-green-the-emergence-of-amateur-genetic-engineers/|website = New Scientist|accessdate = 2015-10-25|language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = That which is not forbidden is Mandatory|last = Katz|first = J.

Biohacking entered the [[San Francisco]] programmer and [[Maker culture|maker]] communities as early as 2005, through simple demonstrations of basic experiments. As DIYbio experiments became the focus of [[SuperHappyDevHouse]] hackers, the hobby gained additional momentum.

In 2005 Rob Carlson wrote in an article in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'': "The era of garage biology is upon us. Want to participate?  Take a moment to buy yourself a  lab on [[eBay]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.05/view.html?pg=2?tw=wn_tophead_5 |title=Splice It Yourself: Who needs a geneticist? Build your own  lab. |author=Rob Carlson |journal=Wired |date=May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then set up a garage lab the same year, working on a project he had previously worked at the [[Molecular Sciences Institute]] in Berkeley, California.&lt;ref name="nature2010"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Garage : Life hackers |author=Heidi Ledford | journal= Nature |year=2010 |volume=467|issue=7316 |pages=650–2| doi= 10.1038/467650a |pmid = 20930820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[DIYbio (organization)|DIYbio organization]] was founded by Jason Bobe and Mackenzie Cowell and its first meeting held.&lt;ref name="pbs3"&gt;{{cite web|title = PBS News Hour|date = 31 Dec 2008|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IIWH6Hhcnc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Genspace]] opened the first community biology lab,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DIY Biotech Hacker Space Opens in NYC|url = https://www.wired.com/2010/12/genspace-diy-science-laboratory/|journal = Wired|accessdate = 2017-07-25|date = 2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten months later it was followed by [[BioCurious]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Make|url = http://makezine.com/2011/10/14/biocurious-officially-opens-test-dna-build-equipment-find-a-cofounder-and-more//|website = Make|publisher = Make |accessdate = 2017-07-25|date = 2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victoria Makerspace]]. Many other labs and organizations followed, including but not limited to Counter Culture Labs in Oakland, CA, Baltimore Underground Science Space in Baltimore, MD, TheLab in Los Angeles, CA and Denver Biolabs in Denver, CO.

In 2016, the first conference to focus specifically on biohacking was announced to take place in Sept. in Oakland, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Biohack the Planet Conference |url = http://biohacktheplanet.com/ |website = Biohack the Planet|publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==
The DIYbio movement seeks to revise the notion that one must be an academic with an advanced degree to make any significant contribution to the biology community. It allows large numbers of small organizations and individuals to participate in research and development, with spreading knowledge a higher priority than turning profits.&lt;ref name="econ"&gt;{{cite news|title = Rob Carlson on synthetic biology|url = http://video.economist.com/?fr_story=706e536c2a60f103f23adcc3f0c0c76150dfbe6b|work = The Economist|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111009112915/http://video.economist.com/?fr_story=706e536c2a60f103f23adcc3f0c0c76150dfbe6b|archivedate = 2011-10-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivations for DIY biology include (but aren't limited to) lowered costs, entertainment, medicine, biohacking, life extension, and education. Recent work combining [[open-source hardware]] of microcontrollers like the [[Arduino]] and [[RepRap]] 3-D printers, very low-cost [[scientific instruments]] have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joshua M. 2012. "[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6100/1303.summary Building Research Equipment with Free, Open-Source Hardware.]" ''Science'' '''337''' (6100): 1303–1304.[https://mtu.academia.edu/JoshuaPearce/Papers/1867941/Open_Source_Research_in_Sustainability open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community laboratory space ===
Many organizations maintain a laboratory akin to a wet-lab [[makerspace]], providing equipment and supplies for members.  Many organizations also run classes and provide training. For a fee (usually between $50 and $100), members can join some spaces and do experiments on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BUGSS Membership|url = http://www.bugssonline.org/payment.html  |website = BUGSS|publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Biocurious Membership|url = http://biocurious.org/join/ |website = Biocurious |publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Counter Culture Labs Membership|url = https://counterculturelabs.org/?page_id=136 |website = Counter Culture Labs |publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open source equipment ===
The DIY biology movement attempts to make available the tools and resources necessary for anyone, including non-professionals, to conduct biological engineering. One of the first pieces of [[open source]] laboratory equipment developed was the Dremelfuge by Irish biohacker Cathal Garvey, which uses a 3D printed tube holder attached to a [[Dremel]] [[rotary tool]] to spin tubes at high speeds, replacing often expensive centrifuges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DremelFuge - A One-Piece Centrifuge for Rotary Tools|url = http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1483 |website = Thingiverse |publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-17 | date = 2009-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other devices like [[Thermal cycler|PCR machines]] have been recreated extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://makezine.com/2011/07/06/dna-is-now-diy-openpcr-ships-worldwide/|work = Make|title =DNA is now DIY|date = 2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lava-amp.com/|work = LavaAmp|title = Pocket PCR for pennies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Coffee Cup - PCR Thermocycler costing under 350$|url = http://www.instructables.com/id/Coffee-Cup-PCR-Thermocycler-costing-under-350/ |website = Instructables |publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-17 | date = 2009-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times, more complex devices have been created such as the OpenDrop digital microfluidics platform&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OpenDrop|url = http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenDrop/ |website = OpenDrop |publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the DIY NanoDrop&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DIY NanoDrop|url = http://hackteria.org/wiki/index.php/DIY_NanoDrop |website = DIY NanoDrop |publisher = Hackteria |accessdate = 2016-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both developed by GaudiLabs. Opentrons makes open-source, affordable lab robots, and got its start as a DIY biology collaboration at Genspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landoni|first1=Boris|title=Interview to Open Trons {{!}} Open Electronics|url=http://www.open-electronics.org/interview-to-open-trons/|accessdate=1 November 2016|work=Open Source Electronics|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advocacy ===
Most advocacy in biohacking is about the safety, accessibility and future legality of experimentation. Todd Kuiken of the [[Woodrow Wilson Center]] proposes that through safety and self-governance, DIY biologists won't be in need of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Todd Kuiken|title = Governance: Learn from DIY biologists|volume = 531|issue = 7593|pages = 167–168|journal = Nature Magazine|accessdate = 2016-06-19|date = 2016-03-09|url = http://www.nature.com/news/governance-learn-from-diy-biologists-1.19507|doi = 10.1038/531167a|pmid = 26961642}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Josiah Zayner]] has proposed that safety is inherent in biohacking and that accessibility should be the foremost concern as there is large underrepresentation of social and ethnic minorities in biohacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last = Steph Yin|title = Is DIY Kitchen CRISPR A Class Issue?|work = Popular Science |accessdate = 2016-06-19|date = 2016-05-03|url = http://www.popsci.com/is-bringing-crispr-to-kitchens-class-issue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research topics ==
Many biohacking projects revolve around the modification of life and molecular and genetic engineering.&lt;ref name=Hicks&gt;{{Cite web|last = Jennifer Hicks |title = The Biohacking Hobbyist|work = Forbes|accessdate = 2016-06-19|date = 2014-03-15|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2014/03/15/move-over-hackers-biohackers-are-here/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioinformatics ===
[[Bioinformatics]] is another popular target for do-it-yourself biology research. As in other fields, many [[programming language]]s can be used in DIY biology, but most of the languages that are used are those with large [[bioinformatics]] [[library (computing)|libraries]].

Examples include [[BioPerl]] or [[BioPython]], which use the languages [[Perl]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], respectively.

=== Genetic engineering ===
Genetic Engineers are a subculture of biohackers as one of the most accessible forms of biohacking is through engineering microorganisms or plants. Experiments can range from using plasmids to fluorescent bacteria, controlling gene expression using light in bacteria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Biocurious Meetup|url = http://www.meetup.com/BioCurious/events/231696709/ |website = Meetup |publisher = Meetup |accessdate = 2016-06-17 | date = 2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; even using [[CRISPR]] to engineer the genome of bacteria or yeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bay Area biologist's gene-editing kit lets do-it-yourselfers play God at the kitchen table|url = http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_29372452/bay-area-biologists-gene-editing-kit-lets-do|website = San Jose Mercury News |publisher = San Jose Mercury News |accessdate = 2016-06-17 | date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medicine ===
Restricted access to medical care and medicine has pushed biohackers to start experimenting in medically related fields. The Open Insulin project aims to make the recombinant protein [[insulin]] more accessible by creating an open source protocol for expression and purification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = These Biohackers Are Creating Open-Source Insulin|url = http://www.popsci.com/these-biohackers-are-making-open-source-insulin |publisher = Popular Science |accessdate = 2016-06-17 | date = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments that have involved medical treatments include a whole body [[microbiome]] transplant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Bitter Pill|work = The Verge|date = 2016-05-04|url = https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/4/11581994/fmt-fecal-matter-transplant-josiah-zayner-microbiome-ibs-c-diff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of open source artificial [[pancreas]]es&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tech-savvy Families use homebuilt diabetes device|work = Wall Street Journal|date = 2016-05-09|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-savvy-families-use-home-built-diabetes-device-1462728637}}&lt;/ref&gt; for diabetics.

=== Implants ===
Grinders are a subculture of biohackers that focus on implanting technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Biohackers are implanting LEDs under their skin|work = Motherboard|date = 2015-11-09|url = http://motherboard.vice.com/read/biohackers-are-implanting-led-lights-under-their-skin}}&lt;/ref&gt; or introducing chemicals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = This Biohacker Used Eyedrops To Give Himself Temporary Night Vision|work = Gizmodo|date = 2016-03-27|url = http://io9.gizmodo.com/this-biohacker-used-eyedrops-to-give-himself-temporary-1694016390}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the body to enhance or change their bodies' functionality. 

Some biohackers can now sense which direction they face using a magnetic implant that vibrates against the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/06/first-humans-sense-where-north-is-cyborg-gadget|title=Meet the first humans to sense where north is|last=Thaddeus-Johns|first=Josie|date=2017-01-06|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
In 2000, controversial and self-described "[[transgenic]] artist" [[Eduardo Kac]] appropriated standard laboratory work by biotechnology and genetics researchers in order to both utilize and critique such scientific techniques. In the only putative work of transgenic art by Kac, the artist claimed to have collaborated with a French laboratory (belonging to the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique) to procure a green-fluorescent rabbit: a rabbit implanted with a [[green fluorescent protein]] [[gene]] from a type of jellyfish [''Aequorea victoria''] in order for the rabbit to fluoresce green under [[ultraviolet light]]. The claimed work came to be known as the "GFP bunny", and which Kac called ''[[Alba (rabbit)|Alba]]''. This claim by Kac has been disputed by the scientists at the lab who noted that they had performed the exact same experiment (i.e., the insertion of the jellyfish GFP protein-coding gene) on numerous other animals (cats, dogs, etc.) previously and did not create ''Alba'' (known to the researchers only as "Rabbit Number 5256") under the direction of Kac. The laboratory consequently kept possession of the transgenic rabbit which it had created and funded and the "transgenic art" was never exhibited at the Digital Avignon festival [2000] as intended. Kac -- claiming that his rabbit was the first GFP bunny created in the name of Art -- used this dispute to popularize the issue as one of disguised censorship by launching a "Free Alba" campaign. A doctored photo of the artist holding a day-glow-green tinted rabbit appears on his website. &lt;ref&gt;"I Love My Glow Bunny" by Christopher Dickey {copyright 2001 by Christopher Dickey}. First published in ''Wired'' and reprinted in ''Best American Science Writing 2002'' {Editor: Matt Ridley}, HarperCollins''Publishers''&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the [[Critical Art Ensemble]] have written books and staged multimedia performance interventions around this issue, including ''The Flesh Machine'' (focusing on [[in vitro fertilisation]], [[biometrics|surveillance of the body]], and [[liberal eugenics]]) and ''Cult of the New Eve'' (In order to analyze how, in their words, "Science is the institution of authority regarding the production of knowledge, and tends to replace this particular social function of conventional Christianity in the west").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.critical-art.net/CONE.html|title=Critical Art Ensemble|work=critical-art.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and concerns==
Biohacking experiences many of the same criticisms as [[synthetic biology]] and [[genetic engineering]] already receive, plus other concerns relating to the distributed and non-institutional nature of the work, involving potential hazards with lack of oversight by professionals or governments. Concerns about biohackers creating pathogens in unmonitored garage laboratories led the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) to begin sending its representatives to DIYbio conferences in 2009.&lt;ref name="nature2010"/&gt;  The arrest and prosecution of some members for their work with harmless [[microbe]]s, such as artivist [[Steve Kurtz]], has been denounced as [[political repression]] by critics who argue the U.S. government has used [[USA PATRIOT Act|post-9/11 anti-terrorism powers]] to intimidate artists and others who use their art to criticize society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090210231205/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=19246 Scientist pleads guilty to mailing bacteria for 'bio-art']&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing regulations are not specific to this field, so that the possibility of pathological organisms being created and released unintentionally or intentionally by biohackers has become a matter of concern, for example, in the spirit of the re-creation of the 1917 [[flu virus]] by [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]] researchers in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Nature|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7060/full/437794a.html|title = The 1918 flu virus is resurrected|volume = 437|issue = 7060|doi = 10.1038/437794a|pmid = 16208326|date = October 2005|pages = 794–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US the [[FBI Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate]] has worked with the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]'s National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity to convene a series of meetings to discuss biosecurity, which have included discussions of amateur biologists and ways to manage the risks to society it poses.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Zimmer for the New York Times.  March 5, 2012 [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/health/amateur-biologists-are-new-fear-in-making-a-mutant-flu-virus.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; Amateurs Are New Fear in Creating Mutant Virus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prepared by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in conjunction with the Association of American Universities, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation [http://www.aau.edu/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=13876 Bridging Science and Security for Biological Research: A Discussion about Dual Use Review and Oversight at Research Institutions Report of a Meeting September 13-14, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8.16}}  At the National Institutes of Health, National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity&lt;ref&gt;[http://osp.od.nih.gov/office-biotechnology-activities/biosecurity/nsabb NSABB Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; leads efforts to educate the public on "[[Dual-use technology|dual use]] research of concern", for example with websites like "Science Safety Security".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phe.gov/s3/Pages/default.aspx Science Safety Security official website]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, [[DIYbio]] organized conferences to attempt to create codes of ethics for biohackers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = The role of codes of conduct in the amateur biology community|url = http://societyofbiologyblog.org/codes-of-conduct-in-the-amateur-biology-community/|accessdate = 4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat Mooney, executive director of [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]], is a critic of biohacking who argues that&amp;mdash;using a [[laptop]] computer, published [[gene sequence]] information, and mail-order [[synthetic DNA]]&amp;mdash;just about anyone has the potential to construct genes or entire [[genome]]s from scratch (including those of the lethal pathogens) in the near-future.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} A 2007 ETC Group report warns that the danger of this development is not just bio-terror, but "bio-error".&lt;ref name="ETC Group 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author = [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]]|title = Extreme Genetic Engineering: An Introduction to Synthetic Biology|date = January 2007|url = http://openwetware.org/images/e/e4/Synbioreportweb.pdf|format = PDF|accessdate = 2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While no DIYbio project to date has involved harmful agents,{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} the fear remains in the minds of both regulators and laypersons. However, it is often pointed out that DIYbio is at too early a stage to consider such advanced projects feasible, as few successful transformative genetics projects have been undertaken yet. It is also worth noting that, while an individual could conceivably do harm with sufficient skill and intent, there exist biology labs throughout the world with greater access to the technology, skill and funding to accomplish a [[Biological warfare|bioweapon]]s project.

While detractors argue that do-it-yourself biologists need some sort of supervision, enthusiasts argue that uniform supervision is impossible and the best way to prevent accidents or malevolence is to encourage a culture of transparency, where, in essence, do-it-yourself biologists would be peer reviewed by other biohackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Seed Magazine|url = http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/the_biohacking_hobbyist/|title = The Biohacking Hobbyist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enthusiasts argue that fear of potential hazards should be met with increased research and education rather than closing the door on the profound positive impacts that distributed biological technology will have on human health, the environment, and the standard of living around the world.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web |title = DIYbio/FAQ|url = http://openwetware.org/wiki/DIYbio/FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the lack of precedent regarding such a business model, the DIYbio founders see this as an opportunity to be innovators in regulatory and safety policy.&lt;ref name="pbs3"/&gt;

[[Image:Walhall by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|"Valhalla" (1905) by [[Emil Doepler]].]]
In [[Norse mythology]], the '''einherjar''' ([[Old Norse]] "single (or once) fighters"&lt;ref name=ORCHARD36LINDOW104&gt;Orchard (1997:36) and Lindow (2001:104).&lt;/ref&gt;) are those who have died in battle and are brought to [[Valhalla]] by [[valkyrie]]s. In Valhalla, the einherjar eat their fill of the nightly-resurrecting beast [[Sæhrímnir]], and valkyries bring them [[mead]] (which comes from the udder of the goat [[Heiðrún]]). The einherjar prepare daily for the events of [[Ragnarök]], when they will advance for an immense battle at the field of [[Vígríðr]].

The einherjar are attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], the poem ''[[Hákonarmál]]'' (by the 10th century [[skald]] [[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]]) as collected in ''[[Heimskringla]]'', and a stanza of an anonymous 10th century poem commemorating the death of [[Eric Bloodaxe]] known as ''[[Eiríksmál]]'' as compiled in ''[[Fagrskinna]]''.

An [[etymology|etymologically]] connection exists between the einherjar and the [[Harii]] (a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic peoples]] or figures form early Germanic folklore attested in the 1st century AD), and scholars have connected the einherjar to the eternal battle of [[Hjaðningavíg]] and the [[Wild Hunt]]. The einherjar have been the subject of works of art and poetry.

==Attestations==
===''Poetic Edda''===
[[Image:Hild, Thrud and Hløkk by Frølich.jpg|thumb|Three valkyries bearing ale in Valhalla (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]].]]
In the poem ''[[Vafþrúðnismál]]'', [[Odin]] engages the wise [[jötunn]] [[Vafþrúðnir]] in a game of wits. Disguised as ''[[List of names of Odin|Gagnráðr]]'', Odin asks Vafþrúðnir  "where men fight in courts every day." Vafþrúðnir responds that (here ''einherjar'' is translated as ''einheriar''):

{{cquote|All the Einheriar fight in Odin's courts&lt;br&gt;
every day;&lt;br&gt;
they choose the slain and ride from battle;&lt;br&gt;
then they sit more at peace together.&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON46&gt;Larrington (1999:46).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the poem ''[[Grímnismál]]'', Odin (disguised as ''[[List of names of Odin|Grímnir]]'') tells the young [[Agnarr Geirröðsson|Agnar]] that the cook [[Andhrímnir]] boils the beast [[Sæhrímnir]], which he refers to as "the best of pork", in the container [[Eldhrímnir]], yet adds that "but few know by what the einheriar are nourished."&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON54&gt;Larrington (1999:54).&lt;/ref&gt; Further into ''Grímnismál'', Odin gives a list of valkyries (Skeggjöld, Skögul, Hildr, [[Þrúðr]], Hlökk, Herfjötur, Göll, Geirahöð, Randgríð, Ráðgríð, and Reginleif), and states that they bear ale to the einherjar.&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON57&gt;Larrington (1999:57).&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the poem, another reference to the einherjar appears when Odin tells the king [[Geirröd]] (unaware that the man he has been torturing is Odin) that Geirröd is drunk, and that Geirröd loses much when he loses his favor and the favor of "all the Einherjar."&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON59&gt;Larrington (1999:59).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'', the hero [[Sinfjötli]] [[flyting|flyts]] with Guðmundr. Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been a female, including that he was "a witch, horrible, unnatural, among Odin's valkyries" and that all of the einherjar "had to fight, headstrong women, on your account".&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON119&gt;Larrington (1999:119)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Prose Edda''===
[[Image:Valkyrie (1834-1835) by H. W. Bissen.jpg|thumb|"Valkyrie" (1834–1835) by [[Herman Wilhelm Bissen]].]]
In the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', the einherjar are introduced in chapter 20. In chapter 20, [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|Third]] tells [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (described as king [[Gylfi]] in disguise) that Odin is called ''Valföðr'' (Old Norse "father of the slain") "since all those who fall in battle are his adopted sons," and that Odin assigns them places in Valhalla and [[Vingólf]] where they are known as einherjar.&lt;ref name=FAULKES21&gt;Faulkes (1995:21).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 35, [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] quotes the ''Grímnismál'' valkyrie list, and says that these valkyries wait in Valhalla, and there serve drink, and look after tableware and drinking vessels in Valhalla. In addition, High says that Odin sends valkyries to every battle, that they allot death to men, and govern victory.&lt;ref name=FAULKES31&gt;Faulkes (1995:31).&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 38, High provides more detail about the einherjar. Gangleri says that "you say that all those men that have fallen in battle since the beginning of the world have now come to Odin in Val-hall. What has he got to offer them food? I should have thought that there must be a pretty large number there." High replies that it is true there are a pretty large number of men there, adding many more have yet to arrive, yet that "there will seem too few when [[Fenrir|the wolf]] comes." However, High adds that food is not a problem because there will never be too many people in Valhalla that the meat of Sæhrímnir (which he calls a [[boar]]) cannot sufficiently feed. High says that Sæhrímnir is cooked every day by the cook Andhrímnir in the pot Eldhrimnir, and is again whole every evening. High then quotes the stanza of ''Grímnismál'' mentioning the cook, meal, and container in reference.&lt;ref name=FAULKES32&gt;Faulkes (1995:32).&lt;/ref&gt;

Further into chapter 38, Gangleri asks if Odin consumes the same meals as the einherjar. High responds that Odin gives the food on his table to his two wolves [[Geri and Freki]], and that Odin himself needs no food, for Odin gains sustenance from wine as if it were drink and meat. High then quotes another stanza from ''Grímnismál'' in reference. In chapter 39, Gangleri asks what the einherjar drink that is as plentiful as their food, and if they drink water. High responds that it is strange that Gangleri is asking if Odin, the All-Father, would invite kings, earls, and other "men of rank" to his home and give them water to drink. High says that he "swears by his faith" that many who come to Valhalla would think that he paid a high price for a drink of water if there were no better beverages there, after having died of wounds and in agony. High continues that atop Valhalla stands the [[goat]] [[Heiðrún]], and it feeds on the foliage of the tree called [[Læraðr]]. From Heiðrún's [[udder]]s flow [[mead]] that fills a vat a day. The vat is so large that all of the einherjar are able to drink to their fullness from it.&lt;ref name=FAULKES33&gt;Faulkes (1995:33).&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 40, Gangleri says that Valhalla must be an immense building, yet it must often be crowded around the doorways. High responds that there are plenty of doors, and that crowding doesn't occur around them. In support, High again quotes a stanza from ''Grímnismál''. In chapter 41, Gangleri notes that there are very many people in Valhalla, and that Odin is a "very great lord when he commands such a troop". Gangleri then asks what entertainment the einherjar have when they're not drinking. High responds that every day, the einherjar get dressed and "put on war-gear and go out into the courtyard and fight each other and fall upon each other. This is their sport." High says that when dinner time arrives, the einherjar ride back to Valhalla and sit down to drink. In reference, High quotes a stanza from ''Grímnismál''.&lt;ref name=FAULKES34&gt;Faulkes (1995:34).&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 51, High foretells the events of Ragnarök. After the god [[Heimdallr]] awakens all the gods by blowing his horn [[Gjallarhorn]], they will assemble at a [[Thing (assembly)|thing]], Odin will ride to the well [[Mímisbrunnr]] and consult [[Mímir]] on behalf of himself and his people, the world tree [[Yggdrasil]] will shake, and then the [[Æsir]] and the einherjar will don their war gear. The Æsir and einherjar will ride to the field [[Vígríðr]] while Odin rides before them clad in a golden helmet, mail, and holding his spear [[Gungnir]], and heading towards the wolf Fenrir.&lt;ref name=FAULKES54&gt;Faulkes (1995:54).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In chapter 52, Gangleri asks what will happen after the heavens, earth, and all of the world are burned and the gods, einherjar and all of mankind have died, noting that he had previously been told that "everyone will live in some world or other for ever and ever." High replies with a list of locations, and then describes the re-emerging of the world after Ragnarök.&lt;ref name=FAULKES55-56&gt;Faulkes (1995:55–56).&lt;/ref&gt; The einherjar receive a final mention in the ''Prose Edda'' in chapter 2 of the book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', where a quote from the anonymous 10th century poem ''[[Eiríksmál]]'' is provided (see the '' Fagrskinna'' section below for more detail and another translation from another source):

{{cquote|What sort of dream is that, Odin?&lt;br&gt;
I dreamed I rose up before dawn&lt;br&gt;
to clear up Val-hall for slain people.&lt;br&gt;
I aroused the Einheriar,&lt;br&gt;
bade them get up to strew the benches,&lt;br&gt;
clean the beer-cups,&lt;br&gt;
the valkyries to serve wine&lt;br&gt;
for the arrival of a prince.&lt;ref name=FAULKES69&gt;Faulkes (1995:69).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Heimskringla''===
[[Image:Heimdallr and valkyries by Frølich.jpg|thumb|An illustration of valkyries encountering the god [[Heimdallr]] as they carry a dead man to Valhalla (1906) by [[Lorenz Frølich]].]]
At the end of the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' saga ''[[Hákonar saga góða]]'', the poem ''[[Hákonarmál]]'' (by the 10th century [[skald]] [[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]]) is presented. The saga relates that king [[Haakon I of Norway]] died in battle, and yet though he is Christian, he requests that since he has died "among heathens, then give me such burial place as seems most fitting to you." The saga relates that, shortly after, Haakon died on the same slab of rock that he was born upon, that he was greatly mourned by friend and foe alike, and that his friends moved his body northward to Sæheim in North [[Hordaland]]. Haakon was there buried in a large burial mound in full armor and his finest clothing, yet with no other valuables. Further, "words were spoken over his grave according to the custom of heathen men, and they put him on the way to Valhalla." The poem ''Hákonarmál'' is then provided.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER124-125"&gt;Hollander (2007:124–125).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Hákonarmál'', Odin sends forth the two valkyries Göndul and Skögul to "choose among the kings' kinsmen" and who in battle should dwell with Odin in Valhalla. A battle rages with great slaughter. Haakon and his men die in battle, and they see the valkyrie Göndul leaning on a spear shaft. Göndul comments that "groweth now the gods' following, since Hákon has been with host so goodly bidden home with holy godheads." Haakon hears "what the valkyries said," and the valkyries are described as sitting "high-hearted on horseback," wearing helmets, carrying shields and that the horses wisely bore them.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER125"&gt;Hollander (2007:125).&lt;/ref&gt; A brief exchange follows between Haakon and the valkyrie Skögul:

{{cquote|''Hákon said:''&lt;br&gt;
'Why didst Geirskogul grudge us victory?&lt;br&gt;
though worthy we were for the gods to grant it?'&lt;br&gt;
''Skogul said:''&lt;br&gt;
'Tis owing to us that the issue was won&lt;br&gt;
and your foemen fled.'&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER126"&gt;Hollander (2007:126).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Skögul says that they shall now ride forth to the "green homes of the godheads" to tell Odin the king will come to Valhalla. In Valhalla, Haakon is greeted by [[Hermóðr]] and [[Bragi]]. Haakon expresses concern that he shall receive Odin's hate ([[Lee Hollander]] theorizes this may be due to Haakon's conversion to Christianity from his native heathenism), yet Bragi responds that he is welcome:

{{cquote|'All einheriar shall swear oaths to thee:&lt;br&gt;
share thou the Æsir's ale, thou enemy-of-earls!&lt;br&gt;
Here within hast thou brethren eight,' said Bragi.&lt;ref name=HOLLANDER126&gt;Hollander (2007:126).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Fagrskinna''===
In chapter 8 of ''[[Fagrskinna]]'', a prose narrative states that, after the death of her husband [[Eric Bloodaxe]], [[Gunnhild Mother of Kings]] had a poem composed about him. The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as ''[[Eiríksmál]]'', and describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death. The poem begins with comments by Odin (as Old Norse ''Óðinn''):

{{cquote|'What kind of a dream is it,' said Óðinn,&lt;br&gt;
'in which just before daybreak,&lt;br&gt;
I thought I cleared Valhǫll,&lt;br&gt;
for coming of slain men?&lt;br&gt;
I waked the Einherjar,&lt;br&gt;
bade valkyries rise up,&lt;br&gt;
to strew the bench,&lt;br&gt;
and scour the beakers,

wine to carry,&lt;br&gt;
as for a king's coming,&lt;br&gt;
here to me I expect&lt;br&gt;
heroes' coming from the world,&lt;br&gt;
certain great ones,&lt;br&gt;
so glad is my heart.'&lt;ref name=FINLAY58&gt;Finlay (2004:58).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The god Bragi asks where a thundering sound is coming from, and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla—and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes [[Sigmund]] and [[Sinfjötli]] to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.&lt;ref name=FINLAY59&gt;Finlay (2004:59).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigmund asks Odin why he would expect Eric more than any other king, to which Odin responds that Eric has reddened his gore-drenched sword with many other lands. Eric arrives, and Sigmund greets him, tells him that he is welcome to come into the hall, and asks him what other lords he has brought with him to Valhalla. Eric says that with him are five kings, that he will tell them the name of them all, and that he, himself, is the sixth.&lt;ref name=FINLAY59/&gt;

==Theories and proposed etymological connections==
[[Image:Tangelgarda Odin.jpg|thumb|The 8th-century [[Tängelgårda stone]] depicts a figure leading a troop of warriors all bearing rings. [[Valknut]] symbols appear beneath his horse.]]

According to [[John Lindow]], Andy Orchard, and [[Rudolf Simek]], scholars have commonly connected the einherjar to the [[Harii]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] attested by [[Tacitus]] in his 1st-century AD work ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''.&lt;ref name=LINDOW104-105&gt;Lindow (2001:104–105).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ORCHARD36&gt;Orchard (1997:36).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SIMEK71&gt;Simek (2007:71).
&lt;/ref&gt;
Tacitus writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:As for the Harii, quite apart from their strength, which exceeds that of the other tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they cause panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so unexpected and hellish; in every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered.&lt;ref name=ORCHARD36/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lindow says that "many scholars think there may be basis for the myth in an ancient Odin cult, which would be centered on young warriors who entered into an ecstatic relationship with Odin" and that the name ''Harii'' has been [[etymology|etymologically]] connected to the ''-herjar'' element of ''einherjar''.&lt;ref name=LINDOW104-105/&gt; Simek says that since the connection has become widespread, "one tends to interpret these obviously living armies of the dead as religiously motivated bands of warriors, who led to the formation of the concept of the ''einherjar'' as well as the [[Wild Hunt]] [...]". Simek continues that the notion of an eternal battle and daily resurrection appears in book I of [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' and in reports of the eternal battle of [[Hjaðningavíg]].&lt;ref name=SIMEK71/&gt;

According to [[Guðbrandur Vigfússon]], the concept of the einherjar links directly to the Old Norse name ''[[Einar]]r''. Vigfússon comments that "the name Einarr is properly = einheri", and points to a relation to the term with the Old Norse common nouns ''einarðr'' (meaning "bold") and ''einörð'' (meaning "valour").&lt;ref name=VIGFUSSON121&gt;Vigfusson (1874:121).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gandalf Alfgeirsson''' ([[Old Norse]]: ''Gandálf Álfgeirsson'') was a legendary king of the petty kingdom [[Vingulmark]], in south-eastern [[Norway]] and south-western [[Sweden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sagan om Bilbo föddes i Västsverige|url=https://www.gp.se/resor/1.1676175-sagan-om-bilbo-foddes-i-vastsverige?m=print}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is portrayed in [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s saga ''[[Heimskringla]]''.

Heimskringla relates that Gandalf was given the kingdom of Alfheim by his father Alfgeir. A Gandalf, normally taken to be the same, fought with [[Halfdan the Black]] for overlordship of what would become Norway under Halfdan the Black's son [[Harald Fairhair]]. They reached an temporary agreement to share [[Vingulmork]] between them. In a later episode, apparently after Gandalf's death, his three sons, Hysing, Helsing, and Hake, attempted to ambush Halfdan the Black at night but he escaped into the forest. After raising an army, he returned and defeated the brothers, killing Hysing and Helsing. Hake fled from the country and Halfdan became king of all of Vingulmórk (possibly all of old Alfheim).

The stories of Gandalf and his sons was found in a place historically called [[Álfheimr (region)|Álfheimr]] which spans modern-day Bohuslän, in Sweden, Göta og Klara älv, originating in [[Trysil]], as well as [[Glåmma]], both the east and the west fold of Vingulmórk (cf. Oslo), the part of Alfheim given to King Guðrød Halfdanson by King Alfarinn as dowry, when princess Alfhild was married to the grandfather of [[Harald Fairhair]]. Olaf Geirstadalv's mother was, if not identical to Alfhild, his aunt called Olöf&lt;ref&gt;According to Þattr Olafs Geirstada alfs: http://heimskringla.no/wiki/%C3%9E%C3%A1ttr_%C3%93lafs_Geirsta%C3%B0a_%C3%A1lfs&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Family==
Gandalf's only known wife was Gauthild Gyrithe Alfsdottir. They had (presumably) four children, three sons and a daughter.
* Alfhild
* Hysing
* Helsing
* Haki

==Ancestry==
Gandalf's father was King Alfgeir.

[[File:Atlas-Agena 6 Launch.jpg|thumb|right|135px|The Atlas-Agena launches the Agena Target Vehicle for the intended Gemini 6 rendezvous mission, attempted October 25, 1965 but fails.]]
The original Gemini 6 mission, scheduled for launch on October 25, 1965 at 12:41 pm EDT, had a planned mission duration of 46 hours 47 minutes, completing a total of 29 orbits. It was to land in the western Atlantic Ocean south of Bermuda.

The mission was to include four dockings with the [[Agena Target Vehicle]]. The first docking was scheduled for five hours and forty minutes into the mission. The second was scheduled for seven hours and forty-five minutes, the third at nine hours and forty minutes, and the fourth and final docking at ten hours and five minutes into the mission. The final undocking would take place at 18 hours and 20 minutes into the mission. At 23 hours and 55 minutes into the mission, while the spacecraft passed over [[White Sands, New Mexico]], the crew was to attempt to observe a laser beam originating from the ground. The retrorockets were scheduled to be fired at 46 hours and 10 minutes into the mission over the Pacific Ocean on the 29th orbit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FBVEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zLAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=orbits%20gemini-6&amp;pg=2041%2C1887474 "Here Is The Condensed Flight Plan For Gemini 6"], ''Williamson, WV Daily News'', Oct 25, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

Original mission plans also included the first live television coverage of the recovery of a US spacecraft at sea from the recovery ship, the US aircraft carrier ''Wasp''. The ''Wasp'' was fitted with ground station equipment by [[ITT Corporation|ITT]] to relay live television, via the [[Intelsat I]] (nicknamed the "Early Bird") satellite.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7J1RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kWwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=carrier%20gemini-6&amp;pg=5351%2C3817722 "Live TV From Wasp For Gemini-6 Flight,"], ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', Oct 22, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original mission cancelled===
On October 25, 1965, Schirra and Stafford boarded their Gemini 6 craft to prepare for launch. Fifteen minutes later, the unmanned [[Atlas-Agena]] [[Agena target vehicle|target vehicle]] was launched. After a successful burn of the Atlas booster, the Agena's secondary engines fired to separate it from the Atlas. But immediately after the Agena's primary engine fired at the six-minute mark in its flight, [[telemetry]] was lost. A catastrophic failure apparently caused the vehicle to explode, as Range Safety was tracking multiple pieces of debris falling into the Atlantic Ocean. After 50 minutes, the Gemini launch was canceled.&lt;ref name=astronautix&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/flights/gemini6.htm Astronautix] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018015653/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/gemini6.htm |date=2010-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4uE9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VUgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=gemini-6&amp;pg=6642%2C4220986 "Gemini 6 Space Shot Fails"], ''Glasgow Herald'', Oct 26, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revised mission===
After reviewing the situation, NASA decided to launch an alternate ''Gemini 6A'' mission, eight days after the launch of [[Gemini 7]], which was scheduled as a 14-day long-duration mission in December. Gemini 6A would perform the first rendezvous of two spacecraft in orbit, using Gemini 7 as the target, though they would not dock. The crews also discussed the possibility of Stafford performing an EVA from 6A to 7, swapping places with Gemini 7 pilot [[Jim Lovell]], but the commander of Gemini 7, [[Frank Borman]], objected, pointing out that it would require Lovell to wear an uncomfortable EVA suit on a long-duration mission.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VpAUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-QQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=gemini-6&amp;pg=2131%2C3114713 "Toughest Space Assignment Yet By Gemini, They'll Try It Twice"], ''Ocala Star-Banner'', Oct 29, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight==

===First launch attempt===
[[File:Gemini 6 launch abort.jpg|thumb|left|The launch abort of Gemini 6A, attempted December 12, 1965.]]

The first attempt to launch the 6A mission (second attempt for Gemini spacecraft No. 6) was on December 12, 1965 at 9:54&amp;nbsp;a.m. EST.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt; All went well right up to ignition; the engines ignited, but after about 1.5 seconds they abruptly shut down. Since the clock had started in the spacecraft, mission rules dictated that Wally Schirra, as the commander, had to immediately pull the D-ring between his knees and activate the [[ejection seat]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://space1.com/Spacecraft_Data/Handbook_Illustrations/Gemini_Spacecraft/Gemini_Ejection_Seat/gemini_ejection_seat.html|title=Gemini Ejection Seat|website=space1.com|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; carrying the astronauts away from the disaster that would be the result of a fully fueled Titan II falling back onto LC-19. However, Schirra did not feel any movement and knew that the booster had not lifted, so he decided not to abort. His quick thinking probably saved the mission as the reliability of the Gemini ejector seats was questionable; the astronauts could have been badly injured from high g-forces as the seats had to launch them at least 800 feet, which was deemed a safe distance from an exploding Titan II.

In addition, the cabin interior had been soaking in pure oxygen for hours. Tom Stafford, in a NASA oral history in 1997, later recalled:

{{Quote|text=So it turns out what we would have seen, had we had to do that, would have been two Roman candles going out, because we were 15 or 16 psi, pure oxygen, soaking in that for an hour and a half. You remember the tragic fire we had at the Cape. (...) Jesus, with that fire going off and that, it would have burned the suits. Everything was soaked in oxygen. So thank God. That was another thing: NASA never tested it under the conditions that they would have had if they would have had to eject. They did have some tests at China Lake where they had a simulated mock-up of Gemini capsule, but what they did is fill it full of nitrogen. They didn't have it filled full of oxygen in the sled test they had.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/StaffordTP/TPS_10-15-97.pdf "ORAL HISTORY TRANSCRIPT, THOMAS P. STAFFORD"], ''Johnson Space Center Oral History Project'', Oct 15, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Young also recalled witnessing a test of the ejector seats where the test dummy was launched right through the capsule hatch, remarking, “That’s a hell of a headache, but a hell of a short one...” {{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Even if the astronauts had not been injured or killed, ejection would ruin the spacecraft and delay the mission for months.

About 40 minutes after the aborted launch, the booster and spacecraft were safed and the service tower raised up to it. After removing the propellants from the Titan II, the booster was checked out and they quickly uncovered the main culprit, which was an electrical plug that dropped out of the base of the booster prematurely. Testing revealed that some plugs came out more easily than others, so they were replaced by different ones that would stay in place properly.

However, the electrical plugs turned out to not be the only problem with the booster. Examination of telemetry also showed that the Titan actually began experiencing thrust decay before the plug dropped out. Engine No. 1 was unaffected and nearly reached 100% thrust at shutdown, while Engine No. 2 never transitioned to in-flight performance levels. Engineers spent all night combing through the first stage, but failed to find any cause for the thrust decay. Eventually however, one technician identified the problem, which was a plastic dust cover inside the gas generator that had been carelessly left inside when the booster was assembled months earlier at the Martin-Marietta plant, blocking the flow of oxidizer. The cover was removed and the Titan II cleared for another launch attempt.

Had the inadvertent electrical disconnect not occurred, the abort sensing system would have sent a shutoff command to the Titan at T+2.2 seconds due to the loss of Engine No. 2 chamber pressure. Since launcher release and liftoff would take place at T+3.2 seconds, a pad fallback still would not have occurred in this scenario and the astronauts would be safe.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/46236174/Launch-Vehicle-No-6-Flight-Evaluationx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rendezvous===
[[File:Gemini VI Launch - GPN-2000-000612.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Launch of Gemini 6A from Pad 19, December 15, 1965.]]
The Titan's batteries were replaced and the fuel prevalves, which had opened, were removed and it was decided to launch without them. The second attempt to launch the 6A mission (third attempt for Gemini spacecraft No. 6) was successful on December 15 at 8:37:26&amp;nbsp;a.m. EST. All went well through launch and ascent; first stage cutoff occurred at T+160 seconds and second stage cutoff at T+341 seconds. Spacecraft separation occurred at T+361 seconds and the crew entered a 161 by 259 kilometers orbit, or as per the actual flight specifications, a 100 by 161 nautical mile orbit.

The plan called for the rendezvous to take place on the fourth orbit of Gemini 6. Their first burn came 94 minutes after launch when they increased their speed by 5 meters (16½ feet) per second. Due to their lower orbit they were gaining on Gemini 7 and were only 730 miles, (or 1,175 kilometers), behind. The next burn was at two hours and eighteen minutes when Gemini 6A made a phase adjustment to put them on the same orbital inclination as Gemini 7. They now only trailed by {{convert|483|km|mi|sp=us}}.

The radar on Gemini 6A first made contact with Gemini 7 at three hours and fifteen minutes when they were {{convert|434|km|mi|sp=us}} away. A third burn put them into a 168 x 170 mile (270 by 274 kilometer) orbit. As they slowly gained, Schirra put Gemini 6A's computer in charge of the rendezvous. At five hours and four minutes, he saw a bright star that he thought was Sirius, but this was in fact Gemini 7.

[[Image:Gemini 6 Views Gemini 7.jpg|thumb|300px|The crew of Gemini 6A took this photo of Gemini 7 when they were about 7 meters apart]]
After several more burns, the two spacecraft were only 130 feet (40 meters) apart. The burns had only used 112&amp;nbsp;lbs. (51 kilograms) of fuel on Gemini 6A, giving plenty of fuel for some fly-arounds. During the next 270 minutes, the crews moved as close as one foot (30 centimeters), talking over the radio. At one stage the spacecraft were stationkeeping so well that neither crew had to make any burns for 20 minutes.

Schirra said that because there is no turbulence in space, "I was amazed at my ability to maneuver. I did a fly-around inspection of Gemini 7, literally flying rings around it, and I could move to within inches of it in perfect confidence".&lt;ref name="agle199809"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Agle |first=D.

This ensured that there would not be any accidental collisions while the astronauts slept.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7552360|title=The history of manned space flight|last=1944-|first=Baker, David,|isbn=051754377X|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=7552360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Christmas surprise===
{{See also|Music in space}}
The next day, before reentry,&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"/&gt; the crew of Gemini 6A had a surprise:

{{quote|...this is Gemini VI. We have an object, looks like a satellite going from north to south, up in a polar orbit. He's in a very low trajectory traveling from north to south and has a very high climbing ratio. It looks like it might even be a ... Very low. Looks like he might be going to reenter soon.

At that point, the sound of "[[Jingle Bells]]" was heard played on an eight-note [[Hohner]] "Little Lady" [[harmonica]] and a handful of small bells.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e30yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YrcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=gemini%20harmonica&amp;pg=2397%2C6613483 "NASA Mum on 'Jingling'"], ''Palm Beach Post'', Dec 17, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=HqfIEQKnkJU|title=The Song from Outer Space}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smithsonian Institution]] claims these were the first musical instruments played in space &lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian magazine, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and keeps the instruments on display.

===Reentry===
[[File:Schirra, Stafford and Gemini on Deck - GPN-2000-001412.jpg|thumb|upright|Schirra prepares to climb out of the capsule, on deck of the recovery ship]]
Gemini 6A fired its retro-rockets and landed within {{convert|18|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} of the planned site in the Atlantic Ocean northeast of [[Turks and Caicos]]. It was the first recovery to be televised live, through a transportable satellite earth station developed by [[ITT Corporation|ITT]] on the deck of the recovery aircraft carrier [[USS Wasp (CV-18)|USS ''Wasp'']].

The Gemini 7 and 6A missions were supported by the following U.S. Department of Defense resources: 10,125 personnel, 125 aircraft and 16 ships.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Insignia==
[[File:Ge06Patch emb.png|thumb|left|Original mission patch, showing the designation GTA-6]]

Walter Schirra explained the patch in the book ''All We Did Was Fly to the Moon'':
{{quote|The Gemini 6 patch is hexagonal in shape, reflecting the mission number; and the spacecraft trajectory also traces out the number "6". The Gemini 6 spacecraft is shown superimposed on the "twin stars" Castor and Pollux, for "Gemini".

I designed the patch to locate in the sixth hour of celestial right ascension. This was the predicted celestial area where the rendezvous should occur (in the constellation Orion). It finally did occur there.}}

The original patch had called the flight GTA-6 (for Gemini-Titan-Agena) and showed the Gemini craft chasing an Agena. It was changed when the mission was altered to depict two Gemini spacecraft.

[[File:John Quidor - The Headless Horseman Pursuing Ichabod Crane - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Headless Horseman Pursuing Ichabod Crane]]'', painting by [[John Quidor]] (1858).]]

The '''Headless Horseman''' has been a [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] of [[Europe]]an [[folklore]] since at least the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=mythicalcreaturesguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mythicalcreaturesguide.com/page/Headless+Horseman|title=Headless Horseman|publisher=Mythical Creatures Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Headless Horseman is traditionally depicted as a man upon horseback who is missing his head. Depending on the legend, the Horseman is either carrying his head, or is missing his head altogether, and is searching for it. Perhaps the most famous myth arises from the short story "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]," written in 1820 by [[Washington Irving]].

== In American folklore ==
{{main|Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)}}
[[File:The Headless Horseman.jpg|thumb|Cover page to Mayne Reid's version of the legend, published in 1865]]
The Headless Horseman is a fictional character from the short story "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]" by American author [[Washington Irving]]. The story, from Irving's collection of short stories entitled ''[[The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.]]'', has worked itself into known American folklore/legend through literature and film.

The legend of the Headless Horseman (also known as "the Headless Hessian of the Hollow") begins in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Traditional folklore holds that the Horseman was a [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian trooper]] who was killed during the [[Battle of White Plains]] in 1776. He was decapitated by an American cannonball&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/memoirsofmajorge00heatrich|title=Memoirs of Major General William Heath|last=Heath|first=William|last2=Abbatt|first2=William|date=1901|publisher=New York, W. Abbatt|others=University of California Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the shattered remains of his head were left on the battlefield while his comrades hastily carried his body away. Eventually they buried him in the cemetery of the [[Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow]], from which he rises as a malevolent ghost, furiously seeking his lost head. Modern versions of the story refer his rides to [[Halloween]], around which time the battle took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Henry John|date=24 January 2014|title=A Phantom is Born? 235 Years Ago|url=http://www.riverjournalonline.com/villages/sleepyhollow/2049-a-phantom-is-born-235-years-ago.html|journal=River Journal|location=Tarrytown, NY|publisher=River Journal Inc.|volume=|issue=|page=|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Headless Horseman''''' is also a novel by [[Thomas Mayne Reid|Mayne Reid]], first published in monthly serialized form during 1865 and 1866, and subsequently published as a book in 1866,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mOuBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22headless+horseman%2C+a+strange+tale+of+texas%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22headless%20horseman%2C%20a%20strange%20tale%20of%20texas%22&amp;f=false|title=The Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction|last=Sutherland|first=John|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781408203903|edition=second|location=Abingdon, Oxon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiug.30112002996210|title=The Headless Horseman: A Strange Tale of Texas|last=Reid|first=Mayne|publisher=Richard Bentley|year=1866|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the author's adventures in the United States. "''The Headless Horseman''" or "''A Strange Tale of Texas''" was set in [[Texas]] and based on a south Texas [[Folklore|folk tale]].

== In Irish folklore ==
The ''[[dullahan]]'' or ''dulachán'' ("dark man") is a headless, demonic fairy, usually riding a horse and carrying his head under his inner lower thigh (or holding it high to see at great distance). He wields a whip made from a human corpse's spine. When the ''dullahan'' stops riding, a death occurs. The dullahan calls out a name, at which point the named person immediately dies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scaryforkids.com/dullahan/ The Dullahan – Ireland's Headless Horseman] at Scary For Kids&lt;/ref&gt; In another version, he is the headless driver of a black carriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shee-eire.com/Magic&amp;Mythology/Fairylore/The-Dullahan/Page1.htm The Dullahan] at Shee-eire.com&lt;/ref&gt; A similar figure, the ''gan ceann'' ("without a head"), can be frightened away by wearing a gold object or putting one in his path.&lt;ref&gt;McKillop, James ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', 2004, cited at ''[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O70-ganceann.htm gan ceann]'', encyclopedia.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Scottish folklore==
The most prominent [[Scottish people|Scots]] tale of the headless horseman concerns a man named Ewen decapitated in a clan battle at Glen Cainnir on the [[Isle of Mull]]. The battle denied him any chance to be a [[tribal chief|chieftain]], and both he and his horse are headless in accounts of his haunting of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, David [http://www.scotlandsa.co.za/fcssa/2010/08/581/ The Headless Horseman]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at Federated Caledonian Societies South Africa&lt;/ref&gt;

==In English folklore==
The 14th century poem [[Gawain and the Green Knight]] features a headless horseman, the titular giant knight. After he is beheaded by [[Gawain|Gawain]] the Green Knight lifts his head up with one hand and rides from the hall, challenging Gawain to meet him again one year later.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight_(Neilson_translation)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In German folklore==
The [[German language|German]] Legends of the [[Brothers Grimm]] (''Deutsche Sagen'') recount two German folk tales of a headless horseman being spotted with their own eyes.

One is set near [[Dresden]] in [[Saxony]]. In this tale, a woman from Dresden goes out early one Sunday morning to gather acorns in a forest. At a place called "[[Verlorenes Wasser|Lost Waters]]", she hears a hunting horn. When she hears it again, she turns around and she sees a headless man in a long grey coat sitting on a grey horse.

In another German tale, set in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] in [[Lower Saxony]], a headless horseman called "the wild huntsman" blows a horn to warn hunters not to ride the next day, because they will meet with an accident.

In some German versions of the headless horseman, he seeks out the perpetrators of capital crimes. In others, he has a pack of black hounds with tongues of fire.

==In Indian folklore==
The ''jhinjhār'' is a headless horseman found in the folklore of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Unlike European depictions, this headless horseman is often portrayed as a heroic figure; folklore states that jhinjhārs are said to be born out of violent and wrongful deaths that occur in protecting innocents. Most stories about the jhinjhār describe it as a [[Rajput]] prince who lost its head while defending a village or caravan from bandits but refusing to back down even after being beheaded, while other versions describe it as a [[Mughal Army|Mughal]] cavalryman trying to defend its prince.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Legend of Sleepy Hollow U.S. Stamp.jpg|thumb|right|US postage stamp, 1974]]
===Comics===
The comic book series ''[[Chopper (graphic novel)|Chopper]]'', written by [[Martin Shapiro]], is a modern-day reimagining of the headless horseman. It features a headless outlaw biker on a motorcycle who collects the souls of sinners.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopfield nets serve as [[content-addressable memory|content-addressable ("associative") memory]] systems with [[Binary numeral system|binary]] threshold [[Artificial neuron|nodes]]. They are guaranteed to converge to a [[local minimum]], but will sometimes converge to a false pattern (wrong local minimum) rather than the stored pattern (expected local minimum). Hopfield networks also provide a model for understanding human memory.

==Structure==
[[Image:Hopfield-net.png|thumb|A Hopfield net with four units.]]
The units in Hopfield nets are binary threshold units, i.e. the units only take on two different values for their states and the value is determined by whether or not the units' input exceeds their threshold. Hopfield nets normally have units that take on values of 1 or -1, and this convention will be used throughout this page. However, other literature might use units that take values of 0 and 1.

Every pair of units ''i'' and ''j'' in a Hopfield network have a connection that is described by the connectivity weight &lt;math&gt; w_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;. In this sense, the Hopfield network can be formally described as a complete undirected graph &lt;math&gt; G = \langle V, f\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a set of [[Artificial neuron|McCulloch-Pitts neurons]] and &lt;math&gt;f:V^2 \rightarrow \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a function that links pairs of units to a real value, the connectivity weight.

The connections in a Hopfield net typically have the following restrictions:
* &lt;math&gt;w_{ii}=0, \forall i&lt;/math&gt; (no unit has a connection with itself)
* &lt;math&gt;w_{ij} = w_{ji}, \forall i,j&lt;/math&gt; (connections are symmetric)

The constraint that weights are symmetric guarantees that the energy function decreases monotonically while following the activation rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacKay|first=David J. C.|author-link=David J.C. MacKay|title=Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms|chapter=42. Hopfield Networks|year=2003|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=508|quote=This convergence proof depends crucially on the fact that the Hopfield network's connections are ''symmetric''. It also depends on the updates being made asynchronously.|isbn=978-0521642989}}&lt;/ref&gt; A network with asymmetric weights may exhibit some periodic or chaotic behaviour; however, Hopfield found that this behavior is confined to relatively small parts of the phase space and does not impair the network's ability to act as a content-addressable associative memory system.

==Updating==

Updating one unit (node in the graph simulating the artificial neuron) in the Hopfield network is performed using the following rule:

&lt;math&gt;s_i \leftarrow \left\{\begin{array}{ll} +1 &amp; \mbox {if }\sum_{j}{w_{ij}s_j}\geq\theta_i, \\
 -1 &amp; \mbox {otherwise.}\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the strength of the connection weight from unit j to unit i (the weight of the connection).
* &lt;math&gt;s_j&lt;/math&gt; is the state of unit j.
* &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; is the threshold of unit i.

Updates in the Hopfield network can be performed in two different ways:
* '''Asynchronous''': Only one unit is updated at a time. This unit can be picked at random, or a pre-defined order can be imposed from the very beginning.
* '''Synchronous''': All units are updated at the same time. This requires a central clock to the system in order to maintain synchronization. This method is viewed by some as less realistic, based on an absence of observed global clock influencing analogous biological or physical systems of interest.

===Neurons "attract or repel each other"===
The weight between two units has a powerful impact upon the values of the neurons. Consider the connection weight &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; between two neurons i and j. If &lt;math&gt;w_{ij} &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, the updating rule implies that:
* when &lt;math&gt;s_{j} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the contribution of j in the weighted sum is positive. Thus, &lt;math&gt;s_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is pulled by j towards its value &lt;math&gt;s_{i} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
* when &lt;math&gt;s_{j} = -1&lt;/math&gt;, the contribution of j in the weighted sum is negative. Then again, &lt;math&gt;s_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is pulled by j towards its value &lt;math&gt;s_{i} = -1&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the values of neurons i and j will converge if the weight between them is positive. Similarly, they will diverge if the weight is negative.

==Energy==

[[File:Energy landscape.png|thumb|right|500px|Energy Landscape of a Hopfield Network, highlighting the current state of the network (up the hill), an attractor state to which it will eventually converge, a minimum energy level and a basin of attraction shaded in green. Note how the update of the Hopfield Network is always going down in Energy.]]

Hopfield nets have a scalar value associated with each state of the network, referred to as the "energy", E, of the network, where:
:&lt;math&gt;E = -\frac12\sum_{i,j}{w_{ij}{s_i}{s_j}}+\sum_i{\theta_i}{s_i}&lt;/math&gt;

This value is called the "energy" because: the definition ensures that, when units are randomly chosen to update, the value of the energy, E, will either lower or stay the same. Furthermore, under repeated updating the network will eventually converge to a state which is a [[local minimum]] in the energy function (which is considered to be a [[Lyapunov function]]). Thus, if a state is a local minimum in the energy function it is a stable state for the network. Note that this energy function belongs to a general class of models in [[physics]], under the name of [[Ising model]]s; these in turn are a special case of [[Markov networks]], since the associated [[probability measure]], the [[Gibbs measure]], has the [[Markov property]].

==Initialization and running==

Initialization of the Hopfield Networks is done by setting the values of the units to the desired start pattern. Repeated updates are then performed until the network converges to an attractor pattern.  Convergence is generally assured, as Hopfield proved that the attractors of this [[nonlinear dynamical system]] are stable, not periodic or chaotic as in some other systems.  Therefore, in the context of Hopfield Networks, an attractor pattern is a final stable state, a pattern that cannot change any value within it under updating.

==Training==
Training a Hopfield net involves lowering the energy of states that the net should "remember". This allows the net to serve as a content addressable memory system, that is to say, the network will converge to a "remembered" state if it is given only part of the state. The net can be used to recover from a distorted input to the trained state that is most similar to that input. This is called associative memory because it recovers memories on the basis of similarity. For example, if we train a Hopfield net with five units so that the state (1, -1, 1, -1, 1) is an energy minimum, and we give the network the state (1, -1, -1, -1, 1) it will converge to (1, -1, 1, -1, 1). Thus, the network is properly trained when the energy of states which the network should remember are local minima.
*Note: In contrast to [[Perceptron#Learning algorithm|Perceptron]] training, the thresholds of the neurons are never updated.

===Learning rules===
There are various different learning rules that can be used to store information in the memory of the Hopfield Network. It is desirable for a learning rule to have both of the following two properties:
* ''Local'': A learning rule is ''local'' if each weight is updated using information available to neurons on either side of the connection that is associated with that particular weight.
* ''Incremental'': New patterns can be learned without using information from the old patterns that have been also used for training. That is, when a new pattern is used for training, the new values for the weights only depend on the old values and on the new pattern.&lt;ref name="storkey1991basins" /&gt;

These properties are desirable, since a learning rule satisfying them is more biologically plausible. For example, since the human brain is always learning new concepts, one can reason that human learning is incremental. A learning system that were not incremental would generally be trained only once, with a huge batch of training data.

===Hebbian learning rule for Hopfield networks===
The [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian Theory]] was introduced by Donald Hebb in 1949, in order to explain "associative learning", in which simultaneous activation of neuron cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells.&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, Donald Olding. The organization of behavior: A neuropsychological theory. Lawrence Erlbaum, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often summarized as "Neurons that fire together, wire together. Neurons that fire out of sync, fail to link".

The Hebbian rule is both local and incremental. For the Hopfield Networks, it is implemented in the following manner, when learning &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;
binary patterns:

&lt;math&gt; w_{ij}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{\mu=1}^{n}\epsilon_{i}^\mu \epsilon_{j}^\mu &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i^\mu&lt;/math&gt; represents bit i from pattern &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

If the bits corresponding to neurons i and j are equal in pattern &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, then the product  &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{i}^\mu \epsilon_{j}^\mu &lt;/math&gt; will be positive. This would, in turn, have a positive effect on the weight &lt;math&gt;w_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; and the values of i and j will tend to become equal. The opposite happens if the bits corresponding to neurons i and j are different.

===The Storkey learning rule===
This rule was introduced by [[Amos Storkey]] in 1997 and is both local and incremental. Storkey also showed that a Hopfield network trained using this rule has a greater capacity than a corresponding network trained using the Hebbian rule.&lt;ref name="storkey1997"&gt;Storkey, Amos. "Increasing the capacity of a Hopfield network without sacrificing functionality." Artificial Neural Networks – ICANN'97 (1997): [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.33.103&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf 451-456].&lt;/ref&gt; The weight matrix of an attractor neural network is said to follow the Storkey learning rule if it obeys:

&lt;math&gt; w_{ij}^{\nu} = w_{ij}^{\nu-1}
		    +\frac{1}{n}\epsilon_{i}^{\nu} \epsilon_{j}^{\nu} 
		    -\frac{1}{n}\epsilon_{i}^{\nu} h_{ji}^{\nu}
		    -\frac{1}{n}\epsilon_{j}^{\nu} h_{ij}^{\nu}
		    &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; h_{ij}^{\nu} = \sum_{k=1~:~i\neq k\neq j}^{n} w_{ik}^{\nu-1}\epsilon_{k}^{\nu} &lt;/math&gt; is a form of ''local field'' &lt;ref name="storkey1991basins"&gt;Storkey, Amos J., and Romain Valabregue. "The basins of attraction of a new Hopfield learning rule." Neural Networks 12.6 (1999): [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.19.4681&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf 869-876].&lt;/ref&gt; at neuron i.
		    
This learning rule is local, since the synapses take into account only neurons at their sides. The rule makes use of more information from the patterns and weights than the generalized Hebbian rule, due to the effect of the local field.

==Spurious patterns==
Patterns that the network uses for training (called ''retrieval states'') become attractors of the system. Repeated updates would eventually lead to convergence to one of the retrieval states. However, sometimes the network will converge to spurious patterns (different from the training patterns).&lt;ref name="hertz1991neural"&gt;Hertz, John A., Anders S. Krogh, and Richard G. Palmer. Introduction to the theory of neural computation. Vol. 1. Westview press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The energy in these spurious patterns is also a local minimum. For each stored pattern x, the negation -x is also a spurious pattern.

A spurious state can also be a linear combination of an odd number of retrieval states. For example, when using 3 patterns &lt;math&gt; \mu_1, \mu_2, \mu_3&lt;/math&gt;, one can get the following spurious state:

&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{i}^{\rm{mix}} = \pm \sgn(\pm \epsilon_{i}^{\mu_{1}} 
			         \pm \epsilon_{i}^{\mu_{2}}
			         \pm \epsilon_{i}^{\mu_{3}})
&lt;/math&gt;

Spurious patterns that have an even number of states cannot exist, since they might sum up to zero &lt;ref name="hertz1991neural" /&gt;

==Capacity==

The Network capacity of the Hopfield network model is determined by neuron amounts and connections within a given network. Therefore, the number of memories that are able to be stored is dependent on neurons and connections. Furthermore, it was shown that the recall accuracy between vectors and nodes was 0.138 (approximately 138 vectors can be recalled from storage for every 1000 nodes) (Hertz et al., 1991). Therefore, it is evident that many mistakes will occur if one tries to store a large number of vectors. When the Hopfield model does not recall the right pattern, it is possible that an intrusion has taken place, since semantically related items tend to confuse the individual, and recollection of the wrong pattern occurs. Therefore, the Hopfield network model is shown to confuse one stored item with that of another upon retrieval. Perfect recalls and high capacity, &gt;0.14, can be loaded in the network by Storkey learning method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Liou | first=C.-Y. | last2=Lin  | first2=S.-L. | title=Finite memory loading in hairy neurons |journal=Natural Computing |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=15–42 |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/s11047-004-5490-x |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11047-004-5490-x.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Liou | first=C.-Y. | last2=Yuan  | first2=S.-K. | title=Error Tolerant Associative Memory |journal=Biological Cybernetics |volume=81 | issue=4 | pages=331–342 |year=1999 |doi=10.1007/s004220050566 | pmid=10541936 |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s004220050566.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulterior models inspired by the Hopfield network were later devised to raise the storage limit and reduce the retrieval error rate, with some being able of [[one-shot learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=ABOUDIB |first1=Ala |last2=GRIPON |first2=Vincent |last3=JIANG |first3=Xiaoran |title=A study of retrieval algorithms of sparse messages in networks of neural cliques |journal=COGNITIVE 2014 : The 6th International Conference on Advanced Cognitive Technologies and Applications |date=2014 |pages=140–146 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01058303/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human memory==
The Hopfield model accounts for [[Association (psychology)|associative]] [[memory]] through the incorporation of memory vectors. Memory vectors can be slightly used, and this would spark the retrieval of the most similar vector in the network. However, we will find out that due to this process, intrusions can occur. In associative memory for the Hopfield network, there are two types of operations: auto-association and hetero-association. The first being when a vector is associated with itself, and the latter being when two different vectors are associated in storage. Furthermore, both types of operations are possible to store within a single memory matrix, but only if that given representation matrix is not one or the other of the operations, but rather the combination (auto-associative and hetero-associative) of the two. It is important to note that Hopfield’s network model utilizes the same learning rule as [[Hebbian theory|Hebb’s (1949) learning rule]], which basically tried to show that learning occurs as a result of the strengthening of the weights by when activity is occurring.

Rizzuto and Kahana (2001) were able to show that the neural network model can account for repetition on recall accuracy by incorporating a probabilistic-learning algorithm. During the retrieval process, no learning occurs. As a result, the weights of the network remain fixed, showing that the model is able to switch from a learning stage to a recall stage. By adding contextual drift they were able to show the rapid forgetting that occurs in a Hopfield model during a cued-recall task. The entire network contributes to the change in the activation of any single node.

McCulloch and Pitts' (1943) dynamical rule, which describes the behavior of neurons, does so in a way that shows how the activations of multiple neurons map onto the activation of a new neuron’s firing rate, and how the weights of the neurons strengthen the synaptic connections between the new activated neuron (and those that activated it). Hopfield would use McCulloch-Pitts's dynamical rule in order to show how retrieval is possible in the Hopfield network. However, it is important to note that Hopfield would do so in a repetitious fashion. Hopfield would use a nonlinear activation function, instead of using a linear function. This would therefore create the Hopfield dynamical rule and with this, Hopfield was able to show that with the nonlinear activation function, the dynamical rule will always modify the values of the state vector in the direction of one of the stored patterns.

'''Kathleen Gretchen "Kay" Williams''' (August 7, 1916 – May 25, 1983) was an American actress. She appeared in numerous uncredited [[bit part]]s throughout the 1940s before playing [[Hazel Dawn]] in [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[The Actress]]'' (1953).

==Career==
Williams was placed under contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1943 but appeared in uncredited bit parts for the remainder of the decade.&lt;ref name=upi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/05/26/Clark-Gables-widow-dead/6204422769600/|work=UPI|title=Clark Gable's widow dead|date=May 26, 1983|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her only credited role was playing actress [[Hazel Dawn]] in [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[The Actress]]'' (1953), written by [[Ruth Gordon]].

==Personal life==
Williams was married four times. Her first marriage to Charles Capps lasted from 1937 to 1939, after which she was married to Martin de Alzaga, an Argentinian cattle tycoon, from 1942 to 1943.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt; She was married to Adolph Bernard Spreckels II, a sugar heir, from 1945 until 1952, with whom she had two children (including [[Bunker Spreckels]]).&lt;ref name=upi/&gt; Williams was married to actor [[Clark Gable]] from 1955 until his death in 1960. The couple had one child.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;

==Death==
Williams, who had battled heart ailments during her life, left California to receive treatment at Methodist Hospital in [[Houston, Texas]], where she died of [[heart failure]] on May 25, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/27/obituaries/kay-gable-65-is-dead-mother-of-film-star-s-son.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Kay Gable, 65, Is Dead; Mother of Film Star's Son|date=May 27, 1983|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term and field of study was invented without any scientific support by [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lt. Col.]] [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]] (US Army, Ret.) of the Killology Research Group in his 1996 book ''[[On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society]]''.&lt;ref name="Wardrip-FruinHarrigan2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wardrip-Fruin|first1=Noah|last2=Harrigan|first2=Pat|title=First Person: New Media as Story, Performance, and Game|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaY9cMnOCUoC&amp;pg=PT102|date=January 2004|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-262-23232-6|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SteuterWills2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steuter|first1=Erin|last2=Wills|first2=Deborah|title=At War with Metaphor: Media, Propaganda, and Racism in the War on Terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIEFAL2YkrMC&amp;pg=PA64|date=15 July 2009|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-3031-5|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The soldier's choice==
Grossman claims in his book ''On Killing'' that soldiers are faced with four options once they have entered into combat.&lt;ref name=grossman&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Grossman | first1 = Dave | authorlink=Dave Grossman (author)  |title = On killing : the psychological cost of learning to kill in war and society | year = 1996 | publisher = Little, Brown | location = Boston | isbn = 978-0-316-33000-8 | pages = 367|oclc= 32312539 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:
# Fight: as the name implies this is the standard that defines the soldiers role as actively trying to defeat the enemy by use of their training.
# Flight: this option involves the combatant fleeing the engagement.
# Posture: This action involves the soldier falsely showing active participation in combat. In actuality they are not being effective in deterring the enemy from success. This is a major point of concern for commanders as it is difficult to tell the difference between a soldier posturing or fighting.
# Submit: Submission to the enemy during an engagement is a direct act of surrender. In the animal kingdom, this is used by lesser combatants to prevent them from being injured after they can ascertain the triviality of their battle.

==The problem of non- or mis-firing soldiers==
[[S.L.A. Marshall]] did a study on the firing rates of soldiers in World War II. He found that the ratio of rounds fired vs. hits was low; he also noted that the majority of soldiers were not aiming to hit their targets.&lt;ref name=Slam&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Marshall | first1 = S. L. A. (Samuel Lyman Atwood) |authorlink= SLA Marshall| title = Men against fire: the problem of battle command | year = 2000 | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press | location = Norman, Okla. | isbn = 978-0-8061-3280-8 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a problem for the US military and its [[Allies of World War II|allies]] during World War II. New training implements were developed and hit rates improved. The changes were small, but effective. First, instead of shooting at [[Bullseye (target)|bull's-eye]] type targets, the [[United States Army]] switched to [[Metallic silhouette shooting|silhouette targets]] that mimic an average human. Training also switched from 300 yard slow fire testing to rapid fire testing with different time and distance intervals from 20 to 300 yards. With these two changes, hitting targets became a reaction that was almost automatic.

Some authors have discredited S.L.A. Marshall's book, stating that the book may be more of an idea of what was occurring and not a scientific study of what was happening. Other historians and journalists have outright accused Marshall of fabricating his study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fire Away |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/76997|first=Evan |last=Hunter |authorlink=Evan Hunter|publisher=[[Newsweek]] |date=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important factor that increased fire and hit rates is the development of camaraderie in training. Soldiers are taught that their actions do not only help or harm themselves, but the whole unit.&lt;ref name=kyle&gt;{{cite book | last = Kyle | first = Chris |authorlink= Chris Kyle| title = [[American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History]] | publisher = W. Morrow | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780062082374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{or|date=July 2016}} This recurring theme in recollections collected from war veterans is the idea that they were not fighting for themselves at the time but more concerned for the people to their left and right. This ideology is ancient and was recorded by [[Sun Tzu]] in his book ''[[The Art of War]]'': "If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst."&lt;ref name=Sunzi&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Sun Tzu | first1 = 6th century BC | last2 = Minford | first2 = John |author2link= John Minford| title = The Art of War | year = 2006 | publisher = Penguin Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-14-303752-1 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Increase in PTSD since World War II==

{{Tone|section|date=March 2015}}

Some research has been done to say that the increase of [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD) in the military is caused by the increase of firing rates.&lt;ref name =grossman /&gt; This brings up the classic debate of correlation vs. causation. Many believe that other factors have been influencing PTSD such as decompression time after conflicts, and the lack of moral sovereignty in engagements.&lt;ref name =grossman /&gt;

===World War II and Vietnam===

[[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] is viewed by some{{who|date=July 2016}} as a less popular war than World War II. Many people who were sent to fight there thought that there was no reason for the engagement and did not feel a moral obligation to fight. In World War II many felt that they were stopping an evil empire from overtaking the globe. This helped the World War II troops' mettle to be steadfast.{{or|date=July 2016}}

Another problem with PTSD rates after World War II is the fact that there is far less decompression time for the soldiers.&lt;ref name =grossman /&gt; During World War II the main way back home was on a boat trip that took weeks. This time was spent with others who had had similar experiences and could understand the problems faced by others.&lt;ref name =grossman /&gt; During Vietnam soldiers were sent via draft to one year rotations by plane. When you arrived to your unit it was usually by yourself and you were shunned. This shunning was a result of the senior members being afraid to befriend someone who had a much higher chance of being killed than the experienced combatants. Once your time in country was over you were once again sent back home by yourself. There may have been other veterans with you but they were from a plethora of other units and you did not know them well enough to share the hardships you had seen.

Finally one of the worst displays of environmental stressors was once you made it back home you were demonized by the public and discarded as a human being. Compare that to the treatment World War II veterans received when they came home from the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theatre]] or the [[Pacific Theatre of World War II|Pacific Theatre]]. Parades were thrown, everyone thanking the soldiers, even the invention of [[V sign|V for Victory]] was made to quickly show military members support. That symbol was changed into the [[Peace sign]] and used to show disapproval of the war in Vietnam just a few years later. These factors among many others caused Vietnam to have the highest postwar depression, suicide, and PTSD rates. To this day many are only now getting the counseling that they need to overcome the mental problems brought upon them from their service in Vietnam.&lt;ref name =grossman /&gt;

===Modern engagements===

In engagements in the modern era such as the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] through the [[Iraq War]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001-2014)|War in Afghanistan]] there is still a problem with a lack of decompression time. The training has improved so you train and deploy with the people you will be fighting with.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = Evan | title = Generation kill: Devil Dogs, Iceman, Captain America, and the new face of American war | publisher = Berkeley Caliber | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780425200407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But many times when you reach home you are given time off, and if one is in a reserve unit you most likely go back to work and only see your brothers in arms once a month. This lack of time to debrief and decompress can cause a feeling of isolation that only worsens the effects of PTSD. Grossman states in his book that everyone who experiences combat comes back with PTSD, the only question is to what extent their mind and psyche are damaged and how they cope with it.

==Claims==
Grossman's theory, based on the World War II research of S.L.A. Marshall, is that most of the population deeply resists killing another human. Some veterans and historians have cast doubt on Marshall's research methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Roger J. Spiller]] (Deputy Director of the Combat Studies Institute, US Army [[Command and General Staff College]]) argues in his 1988 article, "S.L.A. Marshall and the Ratio of Fire" (''[[Royal United Services Institute|RUSI]] [[RUSI Journal|Journal]]'', Winter 1988, pages 63–71), that Marshall had not actually conducted the research upon which he based his ratio-of-fire theory. "The 'systematic collection of data' appears to have been an invention."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

This revelation has called into question the authenticity of some of Marshall's other books and has lent academic weight to doubts about his integrity that had been raised in military circles even decades earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|title=Fire Away |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/76997
|first=Evan |last=Hunter |authorlink=Evan Hunter
|publisher=[[Newsweek]] |date=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of Marshall's work, modern military training was modified to attempt to override this instinct, by:
* using man-shaped targets instead of bullseye targets in marksmanship practice
* practicing and drilling how soldiers would actually fight
* dispersing responsibility for the killing throughout the group
* displacing responsibility for the killing onto an authority figure, i.e., the commanding officer and the military [[hierarchy]] (See the [[Milgram experiment]])

By the time of the United States involvement in the Vietnam War, says Grossman, 90% of U.S. soldiers would fire their weapons at other people.

He also says the act of killing is psychologically traumatic for the killer, even more so than constant danger or witnessing the death of others.

Grossman further argues that [[violence in television]], movies and [[violence in video games|video games]] contributes to real-life violence by a similar process of training and [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]].

In ''On Combat'' (Grossman's sequel to ''On Killing'', based on ten years of additional research and interviews) he addresses the psychology and physiology of human [[aggression]].

'''''La Calavera Catrina ''''' ('Dapper Skeleton', 'Elegant Skull') or '''''Catrina''''' '''''La Calavera Garbancera''''' is a 1910&amp;ndash;1913 [[zinc]] [[etching]] by the Mexican printmaker, cartoon illustrator and [[lithographer]] [[José Guadalupe Posada]].&lt;ref name="artoftheprint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/posada_jose_guadalupe_calaveracatrina.htm|title=Jose Guadalupe Posada, Calavera Catrina (Dapper Skeleton)|publisher=ArtofthePrint.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is offered as a satirical portrait of those Mexican natives who, Posada felt, were aspiring to adopt European aristocratic traditions in the pre-revolution era. ''La Catrina'' has become an icon of the Mexican Día de Muertos, or [[Day of the Dead]].

The zinc etching depicts a female skeleton dressed only in a hat, her ''chapeau en attende'' is related to European styles of the early 20th century. The original leaflet describes a person who was ashamed of their indigenous origins and dressed imitating the French style while wearing lots of makeup to make their skin look whiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mexican-folk-art-guide.com/catrina.html|title=La Catrina|work=Copal, Mexican Folk Art at its best Online.|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This description also uses the word ''garbancera'', a nickname given to people of indigenous ancestry who imitated European style and denied their own cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="rockypoint360"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rockypoint360.com/la-catrina-the-woman-of-mexico|title=La Catrina – The woman of Mexico|date=2012-10-30|work=Rocky Point 360|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorklatinculture.com/catrina/|title=Catrina La Calavera Garbancera is the icon of Día de los Muertos|date=2018-09-25|work=New York Latin Culture Magazine|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural importance ==
"La Catrina has become the referential image of Death in Mexico, it is common to see her embodied as part of the celebrations of Day of the Dead throughout the country; she has become a motive for the creation of handcrafts made from clay or other materials, her representations may vary, as well as the hat." – J.G. Posada&lt;ref name="rockypoint360" /&gt;

While the original work by Posada introduced the character, the popularity of La Calavera as well as her name is derived from a work by artist [[Diego Rivera]] in his 1947 completed mural ''[[Sueño de una Tarde Dominical en la Alameda Central]]'' ''(Dream of a Sunday afternoon along Central Alameda)''.

Rivera's mural was painted between the years 1946 and 1947, and is the principal work of the "Museo Mural Diego Rivera" adjacent to the Alameda in the historic center of [[Mexico City]]. It measures 15 meters long and it stood at the end of Alameda Park. The mural survived the 1985 earthquake, which destroyed the hotel, and was later moved across the street to the [[Museo Mural Diego Rivera]], built after the earthquake for the purpose of housing and displaying Rivera's restored mural.&lt;ref name="sfgate" &gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/mexico/mexicomix/article/La-Catrina-Mexico-s-grande-dame-of-death-2318009.php Mexico's grande dame of death]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic subtext ==

=== Image ===
[[File:Chapala181.JPG|thumb|upright|Figures by Michoacan artisan Emilio Barocio Yacobo at the 2015 ''Feria de los Maestros del Arte'' in [[Chapala, Jalisco]]]]
Rivera's mural depicts a culmination of 400 years of Mexico's major figures, which include himself, Posada, and his wife [[Frida Kahlo]]. Rivera took inspiration from the original etching and gave Calavera a body as well as more of an identity in her elegant outfit as she is poised between himself and Posada. The intent seemed to be to show the tradition of welcoming and comfort the Mexicans have with death and especially the identity of a [[Santa Muerte|Lady of the Dead]], harking back to the heritage of the Aztec goddess [[Mictecacihuatl]].  As explained by [[curator]] David de la Torre from the [[LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes]], a [[Mexican-American]] museum and cultural center in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], US, Catrina has come to symbolize not only [[Día de Muertos]] and the Mexican willingness to laugh at death itself, but originally Catrina was an elegant or well-dressed woman, so it refers to rich people,&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt; de la Torre said. "Death brings this neutralizing force; everyone is equal in the end. Sometimes people have to be reminded of that."

=== Culture ===
The culture of La Calavera has ties to political satire and is also a well-kept tradition as the original was inspired by the polarizing reign of dictator [[Porfirio Díaz]]. Díaz is lauded for modernizing and bringing financial stability to Mexico, but he also led his government in repression, corruption, and excess, and had an apparent obsession with European materialism and culture. Christine Delsol writes: "Concentration of fantastic wealth in the hands of the privileged few brewed discontent in the hearts of the suffering many, leading to the 1910 rebellion that toppled Diaz in 1911 and became the Mexican Revolution."&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;

=== Social Classes ===
She also symbolizes the contrasts between the upper and lower classes, for times were cruel. The social classes were extremely segmented and the highest class was the most fortunate, enjoying many privileges; in contrast, the lower classes were nearly invisible. To explain and rescue the folklore of honoring the memory of those who have passed away, while showing this off to high society, José Guadalupe Posada made caricatures of Death, one of these drawings being the famous Calavera with an elegant hat, though only representing the head and bust with a sophisticated and skeletal essence.&lt;ref name="rockypoint360" /&gt;

== Links to Mesoamerica ==

=== Aztecs ===
The calavera's ties to the past heritage of the Aztecs can be seen in various ways. The indigenous culture of skulls and the death-goddess [[Mictecacihuatl]] is common in [[pre-Columbian art]]. Lady of the Dead, Mictecacihuatl, was keeper of the bones in the underworld, and she presided over the ancient month-long Aztec festivals honoring the dead. Since the [[pre-Columbian era]], Mexican culture has maintained a certain reverence towards death,&lt;ref name="peña"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Araujo Peña |first=Sandra Alejandro |author2=Barbosa Ramírez Marisela |author3=Galván Falcón Susana |author4=García Ortiz Aurea |author5=Uribe Ordaz Carlos |title=El culto a la Santa Muerte: un estudio descriptivo |trans-title=The cult of Santa Muerte:A descriptive study |journal=Revista Psichologia |publisher=Universidad de Londres |location=Mexico City |url=http://www.udlondres.com/revista_psicologia/articulos/stamuerte.htm |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be seen in the widespread commemoration of the [[Day of the Dead]].&lt;ref name="MRamirez"&gt;{{cite news |title='Saint Death' comes to Chicago |first=Margaret |last=Ramirez |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/death-chicago-08,0,2114588.story |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Christian beliefs superimposed on the ancient rituals, those celebrations have evolved into today's Day of the Dead.&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;

=== Spain ===
As for the Spanish heritage (the death-orientation of the [[monastic orders]], [[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]], and ''[[memento mori]]'' traditions), it blended with the average Mexican's stoic, but far from humorless, view of death.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It should be noted that some find La Catrina to have closer ties to the Dance of Death than to the possible origins of the calavera in the art of ancient Mesoamerica. La Calavera differs markedly from the rigid sobriety of skulls carved by the Aztec or images of decomposing corpses depicted by the ancient Maya. In prints and various other art forms associated with the Day of the Dead—everything from papier-mâché to papel picado (perforated paper) to sugar and chocolate—images of the calavera are unmistakably humorous. The skeletons, often dressed in finery, move playfully and smile widely. In some ways, these animated figures are much closer visually to the European Dance of Death motif in which limber skeletons lead, lure, or drag unwitting mortals to their ends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/124/index.html Global art]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
Though these interpretations seem to ignore the full relationship that the Mexicans have with death, as well as the macabre humor that ties to the cycle of life, death and ceremony that the Aztecs had, it should be understood that few countries pay homage to death the way Mexico does; offerings, songs, respect and humor are all common Mexican expressions towards death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebra.aollatino.com/2010/11/01/what-does-death-mean-for-mexicans/ What does death mean for Mexicans]&lt;/ref&gt; The European ties are there both for comic effect as well as depicting the symbolic shell that Europe cloaked Mesoamerica in, but the native bones still lie within.

== Folk art ==

=== Purist ===
La Calavera Catrina today can be found in her more traditional form both in drawn works as well as sculptures made out of Oaxacan wood carvings, papier-mâché sculptures, majolica pottery, and [[Barro negro pottery|Barro negro black clay pottery]]. She is also coupled with male skeletons.

== Costume ==
Dressing as a "Catrina" is a popular costume in [[Day of the Dead]] celebrations in Mexico. Catrinas typically feature "[[Calavera#Face painting|sugar skull]]" make-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allure.com/story/dia-de-los-muertos-makeup-tradition|title=5 Things to Know Before Doing Dia de Los Muertos Makeup|last=Devash|first=Meirav|work=Allure|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* Works such as the screen print ''Sun Maid'' (''Raisins'') by [[Ester Hernandez|Ester Hernández]] in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] show the influence of Posada's earlier vision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://americanart.si.edu/education/corazon/galeria_06.cfm Sun Mad, Ester Hernández, [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The same might be said of the cover for [[Los Lobos]]' album ''[[La pistola y el corazón]]'', which depicts a pistol toting Catrina in a couple's embrace.

* A character based on La Calavera appears as a protagonist in the 2014 computer-animated film ''[[The Book of Life (2014 film)|The Book of Life]]'', where she is named "[[Santa Muerte|La Muerte]]" and is the queen of the deceased who are remembered by the living. She is referred to in the Latin American Spanish dub as "La Catrina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2262227/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv |title=The Book of Life (2014 film), Trivia |publisher=[[IMDb.com]] |quote=In the Spanish dubbing of the movie, La Muerte is called "La Catrina", this is obviously "Posada's Catrina" a popular iconic skeletal lady that has become associated with the festivities of the Día de Muertos. Her main attribute is a gorgeous hat. In the movie, the modern Mexican icon (La Catrina) and the classic icon (Lady Death), are fused in a single role as the ancient Mayan goddess of death, ruling over one of the lands of the dead.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See footnote.''

* Two educational video series, ''La Calavera'' and ''La Calavera: El úlitmo secreto'', were filmed in Mexico by [[Pearson Education]], and include various program components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PS1lMm&amp;PMDBSOLUTIONID=6724&amp;PMDBSITEID=2781&amp;PMDBCATEGORYID=811&amp;PMDBSUBSOLUTIONID=&amp;PMDBSUBJECTAREAID=&amp;PMDBSUBCATEGORYID=23498&amp;PMDbProgramId=6142&amp;elementType=programComponents La Catrina, Program Components, Pearson Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Both videos integrate language proficiency with culture, and follow the journey of Jamie González as she searches for the secrets of her mysterious great-grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PS1lMm&amp;PMDbSiteId=2781&amp;PMDbSolutionId=6724&amp;PMDbSubSolutionId=&amp;PMDbCategoryId=811&amp;PMDbSubCategoryId=23498&amp;PMDbSubjectAreaId=&amp;PMDbProgramId=6142 La Catrina, Overview, Pearson Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the [[MMORPG]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', during the first and second days of November, a Day of the Dead Celebration is held among the largest Capital Cities of the game. Each city has a Calavera, represented as a dancing female undead NPC dressed in a mariachi outfit. If the player dances with her, his or her player character will also take the appearance of an undead character with a similar outfit.

* In the ''[[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]]'', creatures called Calaveras painlessly welcome into the afterlife those who cannot accept death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/863052391|title=Pathfinder roleplaying game : Bestiary 4|last=Stephen.|first=Radney-MacFarland,|last2=K.|first2=Reynolds, Sean|last3=Dennis.|first3=Baker,|last4=Alexandur.|first4=Alexandrov,|last5=Jason.|first5=Bulmahn,|last6=Gary.|first6=Gygax,|last7=1947-2009.|first7=Arneson, Dave,|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Paizo Pub|isbn=9781601255754|oclc=863052391}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar in appearance to La Catrina, wearing a festive dress and carrying a bouquet of flowers.

* The video game ''[[Need for Speed: Payback]]'' features a crew leader by the name of "La Catrina" as the leader of her crew "Graveyard shift" and one of the first bosses you encounter. Her motto says "When you ride a Hundred Miles an hour, Every decision is Life and Death".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ea.com/games/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-payback/street-leagues/graveyard-shift?cid=37302&amp;ts=1507434703836&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lallah Rookh''', (? - Sept. 11, 1860),&lt;ref&gt;Kunzon, John. ''The One Horse Show'' 1962, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; was a female [[Asian elephant]] in [[Dan Rice]]'s [[circus]].  She was known for her [[tightrope walking]] act.

Lallah started her circus career in [[Franconi's Hippodrome]] under the name [[Jenny Lind]], which she kept from 1848 to 1851.  In 1851, she was renamed [[Romeo and Juliet|Juliet]] and paired with another elephant, [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]].  

Lallah worked with the animal trainer [[Charles Noyes]] who, in 1853, left Franconi's with Lallah and a white [[camel]] to join with Rice's circus in [[Columbus, Ohio]].  Rice renamed her Lallah Rookh after [[Lalla-Rookh|the popular poem by Thomas Moore]] and she began performing in the show two days after they arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Carlyon, David.  ''Dan Rice'' 2001, p.165-166&lt;/ref&gt;

Lallah was the first elephant in the United States to perform a [[head stand]] consistently.&lt;ref&gt;Carlyon, David.  ''Dan Rice'' 2001, p.192&lt;/ref&gt;  Her most famous feat was her tightrope walking act.  Lallah walked on a specially made rope, six inches in diameter and twenty feet long, which hung four feet off of the ground between two pairs of crossed beams.  Midway through her walk, Lallah would stop and raise her foreleg and Dan Rice would give her an [[American flag]] to hold in her trunk as she continued the rest of the way.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzon, John. ''The One Horse Show'' 1962, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1860, Rice had Lallah Rookh swim across the [[Ohio River]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] to drum up publicity for his new "Monster Show."  It took her 45 minutes to swim across the river.  A month later, Lallah died of a fever brought about by her swim.&lt;ref&gt;Carlyon, David.  ''Dan Rice'' 2001, p.294&lt;/ref&gt;

Flying Officer '''Leslie Hamilton''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DFC|MBE|sep=yes}}, was a British [[World War I|First World War]] [[flying ace]] credited with six aerial victories. He disappeared while attempting the first non-stop east-west flight across the Atlantic Ocean. His [[Fokker F.VII]]a, named ''St. Raphael'', was [[List of aerial disappearances|last seen]] over the mid-Atlantic by [[oil tanker]] SS ''Josiah Macy''.&lt;ref name="theaerodrome"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/england/hamilton2.php |title=Leslie Hamilton |work=The Aerodrome |year=2015 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I service==
Hamilton was commissioned into the Corps of Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant on 12 June 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=30 June 1916 |supp=y |issue=29650 |page=6588 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to lieutenant on 12 December 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30850 |date=16 August 1918 |page=9662 |supp=y |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and having transferred to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] to train as a pilot, was appointed a flying officer on 17 January 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30600 |date=26 March 1918 |page=3826 |supp=y |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton was posted to No. 17 Squadron stationed in [[Salonika]], Greece, flying a [[Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5|SE.5a]]. His first victory was on 21 April and was shared with fellow ace [[Acheson Goulding]]. After No. 17 Squadron was merged with No. 47 Squadron to form No. 150 Squadron, Hamilton scored five more wins. The four triumphs he notched between 4 May and 4 September were shared with other aces, such as [[Gerald Gibbs (RAF officer)|Gerald Gibbs]], [[Frederick Dudley Travers|Frederick Travers]], and [[Gerald Gordon Bell]]. Hamilton's sixth and last win, on 18 September 1918, was a solo one.&lt;ref name="ABT"&gt;Shores ''et.al.'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

He was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, which was [[gazetted]] in February 1919. His citation read:
:Lieutenant Leslie Hamilton. (Salonika)
::A gallant and skilful scout pilot who never hesitates to attack enemy formations, however superior in numbers. During recent operations he has rendered exceptional service. He has himself brought down, or assisted to bring down, six enemy machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=7 February 1919 |issue=31170 |page=2040 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post war RAF career==
Hamilton was granted a short-service commission in the RAF on 24 October 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=24 October 1919 |issue=31616 |page=13033 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; but relinquished both his temporary and short service commissions at his own request on 28 November,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=28 November 1919 |issue=31663 |page=14703 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was transferred to unemployed list.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=28 November 1919 |issue=31663 |page=14705 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he soon returned to RAF service, being granted another short service commission on 14 July 1920 with the rank of [[flying officer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=23 July 1920 |issue=31991 |page=7776 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 1921 he married Barbara Webber of [[Maidenhead]], Berkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200474.html |title=Personals: Married |issue=655 |volume=XIII |page=474 |journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |date=14 July 1921 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 he was serving in No. 24 Squadron, based at [[RAF Kenley|Kenley]], and in June he took part in the 3rd RAF Aerial Pageant at [[Hendon Aerodrome]], coming second in a race between [[Avro 504]]s, and with the rest his squadron giving a demonstration of formation flying in [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1922/1922%20-%200370.html |title=The Third R.A.F.

==Commercial career==
Hamilton acquired a [[Martinsyde Buzzard|Martinsyde F.6]] (G-EBDK) from [[F. P. Raynham]], and on 29 January 1925 he flew from London to [[St. Moritz]], Switzerland, via Paris, Zurich, and [[Chur]], a total distance of 450 miles, being airborne for eight hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1925/1925%20-%200082.html |title=London–St. Moritz Flight |issue=842 |volume=XVII |page=82 |journal=Flight |date=12 February 1925 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August he competed in two events at the Royal Aero Club Meeting at [[Lympne Aerodrome]], Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1925/1925%20-%200479.html |title=Royal Aero Club 1925 August Meeting at Lympne |issue=866 |volume=XVII |pages=479–480 |journal=Flight |date=30 July 1925 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton, along with [[Geoffrey de Havilland]], [[Hubert Broad]] and others, was a founder member of the British Private Aircraft Owners' Club on 17 February 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1926/1926%20-%200118.html |title=British Private Aircraft Owners' Club |issue=896 |volume=XVIII |page=110 |journal=Flight |date=25 February 1926 |accessdate=2 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike]] in May Hamilton was one of the pilots taking part a scheme organised by the Royal Aero Club to deliver newspapers by air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1926/1926%20-%200364.html |title=Air Transport |issue=909 |volume=XVIII |page=310 |journal=Flight |date=27 May 1926 |accessdate=2 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton also entered the 1926 King's Cup Race, but was obliged to withdraw as his engine was not ready in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1926/1926%20-%200485.html |title=The King's Cup Race |issue=916 |volume=XVIII |page=423 |journal=Flight |date=15 July 1926 |accessdate=2 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926–27 Hamilton operated a private flying taxi service in Switzerland and the South of France flying a [[Vickers Viking IV]] [[amphibious aircraft]] (G-EBED).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1927/1927%20-%200276.html |title=The Activities of Mr. Leslie Hamilton |issue=956 |volume=XIX |page=250 |journal=Flight |date=21 April 1927 |accessdate=2 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (A replica of G-EBED can be seen at [[Brooklands Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.brooklandsmuseum.com/index.php?/explore/aircraft-gliders-cockpit-sections/ |title=Powered Aircraft |work=Brooklands Museum |year=2015 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aircraft-photographs.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/aircraft-ww1-raf-vickers-54-viking-amphibious-biplane.html |title=Vickers 54 Viking Mk IV amphibious biplane |first=Craig |last=Moore |work=Surviving Restored World War One Aircraft 1914-1918 |year=2014 |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Atlantic flight and disappearance==
[[File:INT. OVERZICHT VLIEGTUIGEN - Schiphol - 20309429 - RCE.jpg|thumb|right|A Fokker VIIa, similar to ''St. Raphael'']]
Hamilton was then involved in an attempt to make the first flight across the Atlantic from east to west, flying from England to [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada. [[Princess Anne of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg|Princess Lowenstein-Wertheim]], a widowed aircraft enthusiast, provided the finance and the aircraft, a [[Fokker F.VII]]a (G-EBTQ) fitted with a 500&amp;nbsp;hp [[Bristol Jupiter]] engine, and named ''[[St. Raphael (aircraft)|St. Raphael]]''. The aircraft, flown by Hamilton and [[Frederick F. Minchin]] from [[Imperial Airways]], with Princess Lowenstein-Wertheim as passenger, took off from [[Upavon Aerodrome]], Wiltshire, on 31 August 1927 at 7.15 a.m. They flew along the south coast of Wales, across to Ireland, making their departure over the [[Aran Islands]]. The last confirmed sighting was made by the oil tanker SS ''Josiah Macy'' at 9.44 p.m in the mid-Atlantic. Around 6 a.m the next morning the Dutch steamer SS ''Blijdendijik'' reported seeing a white light travelling eastward in the sky when about 420 miles east-south-east of New York, which, if it were ''St. Raphael'', was far to the south of its intended route, suggesting that they were lost. The aircraft was never seen again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1927/1927%20-%200688.html |title=The Atlantic Flights |issue=976 |volume=XIX |page=634 |journal=Flight |date=8 September 1927 |accessdate=2 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of United States disasters by death toll''' is a list of notable disasters which occurred either in the [[United States]], at [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|diplomatic missions of the United States]], or incidents outside of the United States in which a number of U.S. citizens were killed. It does not include death tolls from the [[American Civil War]]. Due to [[inflation]], the monetary damage estimates are not comparable. Unless otherwise noted, the year given is the year in which the currency's valuation was calculated. This list is not comprehensive in general and [[epidemic]]s are not included.

A list of future observable astronomy events. These are by no means all events, but only the notable or rare ones. In particular, it does not include [[solar eclipse]]s or [[lunar eclipse]]s unless otherwise notable, as they are far too numerous to list (see below for articles with lists of all these). Nor does it list astronomical events that have yet to be discovered. And some points of the list miss the last date of the events.

All these dates are in a uniform time scale such as [[Terrestrial Time]]. When converted to our ordinary solar time or [[Universal Time]], which is decidedly non-uniform, via [[?T]], the dates would be about one day earlier. Because of this difference, these dates have no anniversary relation to historical dates and should not be linked to them. Furthermore, they are only astronomical dates, so they are given in the astronomical format of Year Month Day, which allows them to be ordered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12928">This is a list of '''massacres in the [[Italian Social Republic]]''' in which there were more than 100 victims. German troops in Italy often massacred civilians in retaliation for partisan activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= |title=Massacres with more than 100 victims|trans-title= |url=http://www.straginazifasciste.it/?page_id=349 |language=Italian |work=Atlas of Nazi and Fascist Massacres in Italy |location= |access-date=21 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To a lesser extent, war crimes were committed by the [[National Republican Army]] (fascist Italian army), usually against [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisans]], such as at the [[Salussola massacre]], where 20 partisans were executed. Partisans, in retaliation, sometimes also massacred captured Fascist soldiers, like at the [[Rovetta massacre]].

The surgeon having sewed him up very close, and wanting a knife to cut off the thread, made use of a candle that was at hand to burn it off; but the flame from the thread reaching the sheet, the spirits wherewith it was wet immediately taking fire, burnt so vehemently, that no endeavours could extinguish the flame.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2250">'''Meat emulsion''' is a two-phase system, with the dispersed phase consisting of either solid or liquid [[fat]] particles and the continuous phase being the water containing salts and dissolved, gelled and suspended [[proteins]]. Thus they can be classified as oil-in-water emulsion. Meat emulsion is not a true emulsion since the two phases involved are not liquids and the fat droplets in a commercial emulsion are larger than 50&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter and thus do not conform to one of the requirement of a classical emulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://meatsci.osu.edu/node/130|title=Meat Emulsions {{!}} Meat Science Extension|last=Knipe|first=C. Lynn|date=1987|website=meatsci.osu.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continuous phase mainly consists of water, water-soluble proteins and salt-soluble proteins. The dispersed phase or discontinuous phase consists of fat droplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | title = Principles of Meat Science | author1= Elton D. Aberle, et al. |  publisher = Kendall Hunt | location=   |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RGWeuZDopcQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Principles+of+Meat+Science+by+Elton+D.+Aberle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik5v_0w_LRAhXj34MKHXhqBFIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Principles%20of%20Meat%20Science%20by%20Elton%20D.%20Aberle&amp;f=false | date = 2001  | pages = 126 - 144  | isbn =  9780787247201 | accessdate = 2 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water-soluble proteins are [[sarcoplasm]]ic proteins such as [[myoglobin]] and other [[pigment]]s; salt-soluble proteins are [[myofibrillar]] proteins such as [[myosin]], [[actin]], and [[actinin]]s.{{clarify|this sentence doesn't make sense as written|date=September 2011}}

== Meat emulsifiers ==
When used in food products, iota [[carrageenan]] and [[sodium stearoyl lactylate]] (SSL) have a synergistic effect allowing for stabilizing/emulsifying that is not obtained with any other type of carrageenan (kappa/lambda) or with other emulsifiers ([[monoglyceride]]s, etc.). Sodium stearoyl lactylate combined with iota carrageenan is capable of producing emulsions under both hot and cold conditions using either vegetable or animal fat.

==Plot==
Kate Fitzgerald ([[Sofia Vassilieva]]) has [[acute promyelocytic leukemia]]. Conceived by [[in vitro fertilization]], her younger sister Anna ([[Abigail Breslin]]) was brought into the world as a [[Savior sibling|savior sister]]. She is a genetic match to her older sister and can donate compatible organs, blood, and tissue to help her. When Kate turns 15, she goes into [[renal failure]] and 11-year old Anna knows that she will be forced by her parents to donate one of her kidneys. She also realizes that she may not be able to live the life she wants to lead – she will not be able to play sports, drink alcohol, or be a mother in the future. Anna tells her parents that she does not want to be a donor and sues them for [[medical emancipation]] and the rights to her own body. Her father Brian ([[Jason Patric]]) understands her, though her domineering mother, Sara ([[Cameron Diaz]]), who leads an obsessive campaign to keep Kate alive, is indignant at her decision. Attorney Campbell Alexander ([[Alec Baldwin]]) agrees to work for Anna as her guardian [[ad litem]], suing for partial termination of [[Parents' rights movement|parental rights]]. He has agreed to take the case because he has [[epilepsy]], and is sympathetic to her predicament.

The film is interlaced with flashbacks that detail Kate and Anna's close relationship, as well as how Kate's illness has affected her siblings, including their brother, Jesse (Evan Ellingson). In a flashback, Kate meets a fellow cancer patient, Taylor Ambrose ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), whom she begins dating. He asks her to the hospital's prom for teen patients; there, they slow-dance, then have sex. A few days later, Kate begins to worry as she has not seen Taylor since the dance. She learns that Taylor has died and attempts suicide by overdosing on painkillers, but Anna stops her. Kate expresses hope that after she dies, she will see Taylor.

Kate makes a request to go to the beach one last time. Brian obtains permission and discharges her from the hospital for the day. Sara overreacts and demands that Kate be returned to the hospital immediately. Brian angrily refuses and threatens Sara with a divorce if she does not join them. Sara shows up at the beach, where they enjoy one final family outing.

During the hearing, Jesse reveals that Anna is actually acting under Kate's instruction; Kate, not wanting to live any longer, had persuaded Anna to refuse to donate her kidney. Anna had wanted to give Kate her kidney and had been upset at Kate's decision. Sara is finally forced to acknowledge what Kate has been trying to tell her all this time: she is ready to die. Later that day, Kate dies sleeping, with her mother by her side. After her death, Campbell states that Anna has won the case. The family moves on with their lives. Sara, who gave up practicing law to look after Kate, returns to work, Brian retires from firefighting and counsels troubled youths, and Jesse receives an arts scholarship in New York. Anna reveals that every year on Kate's birthday they go to [[Montana]], which was her "most favorite place in the world". She concludes that she was not born merely to save her sister, she was born because she had a sister, and that their relationship continues even in death.

==Production and cast changes==
Upon the original creation of the film adaptation, sisters [[Dakota Fanning]] and [[Elle Fanning]] were cast to play Kate and Anna respectively. However, when Dakota heard that she would be required to shave her head for the role, she dropped out of the film as then did Elle. The two sisters were replaced, with [[Abigail Breslin]] taking on the lead role as Anna Fitzgerald and [[Sofia Vassilieva]] on the role of Kate Fitzgerald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dakota Fanning Steps Down From 'My Sister's Keeper' Role|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2008/02/13/dakota_fanning_steps_down_from_my_sister|publisher=Starpulse.com|accessdate=January 12, 2012|date=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2500">The '''PRI disease resistant apple breeding program''' is a joint project of the [[Purdue University]], [[Rutgers University]], and the [[University of Illinois]], to breed [[apple]] [[cultivar]]s to be resistant to [[apple scab]]. PRI stands for 'P'urdue, 'R'utgers and 'I'llinois.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/pri/default.html About PRI]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
It was [[L. Fredric Hough]], then a graduate student at the University of Illinois that studied the papers of [[C. S. Crandall]] that carried out intensive studies early in the 20th century, of crosses between the cultivated apples and [[crab apple]]s, to be scab resistant.&lt;ref name=ISHS&gt;[http://www.actahort.org/books/595/595_7.htm ISHS]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Crandall didn't see any fruits of his investigations, and if not Hough, all his collection and experiments would be lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evercrispapple.com/_PDF/_Newsletters/2002newsletter.pdf 2002 Newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt; Hough's paper was published in 1944, and led to the 1945 collaboration with J. Ralph Shay. Hough then relocated to Rutgers and the collaborative effort was extended there.&lt;ref name=ISHS&gt;[http://www.actahort.org/books/595/595_7.htm ISHS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The program==
The modified [[backcross]] breeding strategy used cultivated [[apple]] with recurrent parents from selected susceptible members of the wild ancestral [[genus]] [[malus]]. Several Malus species were screened and utilized to incorporate their resistance factors into the more advanced pomological backgrounds.&lt;ref name=ISHS/&gt;

==Success==
[[File:Malus_'Pristine'_3.jpg|thumb|[[Pristine apple]], is one of the [[apple scab|scab]]-resistant cultivars, to be developed by "PRI", hence its name "PRI"stine.]]
By 2000, the PRI have already released a total of eighteen apple cultivars, containing the [[apple scab|scab]]-resistant ''Vf gene'' derived from [[Malus floribunda]] 821. Fifty-some PRI germplasm cultivars have also been released worldwide.&lt;ref name=ISHS/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3805">{{about|the pacifist organization||Peacemaker (disambiguation)}}
'''Peacemakers''' was an [[United States|American]] [[pacifist]] organization.  The name of the group was taken from a section of the Bible, the [[Beatitudes]] or Sermon on the Mount: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.”

The group was founded following a conference on “More Disciplined and Revolutionary Pacifist Activity” in [[Chicago]] in July 1948 to advocate [[nonviolent resistance]] in the service of peace, particularly [[conscription|draft]] resistance and [[tax resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won’t Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 446-447&lt;/ref&gt;  The group’s members vowed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) to refuse to serve in the armed forces in either peace or war; (2) to refuse to make or transport weapons of war; (3) to refuse to be conscripted or to register; (4) to consider to refuse to pay taxes for war purposes — a position already adopted by some; (5) to spread the idea of peacemaking and to develop non-violent methods of opposing war through various forms of non-cooperation and to advocate unilateral disarmament and economic democracy.[http://www.manasjournal.org/pdf_library/VolumeI_1948/I-32.pdf]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The group was organized largely by [[Ernest Bromley|Ernest]] and [[Marion Bromley]] and [[Juanita Nelson|Juanita]] and [[Wally Nelson]].&lt;ref name="Cooney"&gt;Cooney, Robert and Michalowski, Helen ''The Power of the People: Active Nonviolence in the United States'' (1987) p. 115-8&lt;/ref&gt; Among the organization’s other founders were [[A.J. Muste]], [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Ralph T. Templin]], [[Roy Kepler]], [[Cecil Hinshaw]], [[Milton Mayer]], [[Bayard Rustin]], [[George Houser]], and [[Horace Champney]]. &lt;!-- incomplete - anyone have the full list? --&gt; Many members came from the [[Committee for Nonviolent Revolution]], which had been formed two years before.&lt;ref name="Cooney" /&gt; Some other participants of note included [[Benny Bargen]], [[Dorothy Day]], [[Ralph DiGia]], [[Fyke Farmer]], [[Walter Gormly]], [[Ammon Hennacy]], [[Bradford Lyttle]], [[Maurice McCrackin]], [[Mary Stone McDowell]], [[Karl Meyer (activist)|Karl Meyer]], [[James Otsuka]], [[James Peck (pacifist)|Jim Peck]], [[Eroseanna Robinson]], [[Igal Roodenko]], [[Max Sandin]], [[George Willoughby (activist)|George Willoughby]], [[Lillian Willoughby]], and [[Edmund Wilson]].

The “Tax Refusal Committee” of Peacemakers is credited for founding the modern American war tax resistance movement.  Peacemakers published the first guide to war tax resistance in 1963. There had been examples of organized war tax resistance in America for centuries, largely in congregations of the [[historic peace churches]], but Peacemakers was the first non-sectarian organized war tax resistance group.

Peacemakers differed from other pacifist and nonviolent resistance organizations in its emphasis on small-scale, local, "cell"-based organization and [[intentional community|intentional communities]]. It had no national office, paid staff, or membership list. Some member groups organized funds to aid war resisters and people in the civil rights movement who had suffered reprisals.&lt;ref name="Cooney" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Platonism}}
'''Platonic idealism''' usually refers to [[Plato]]'s [[theory of forms]] or doctrine of ideas.

==Overview==
Some commentators hold that Plato argued that [[truth]] is an abstraction. In other words, we are urged to believe that [[Plato]]'s theory of ideals is an [[abstraction]], divorced from the so-called external world, of modern European philosophy, despite the fact Plato taught that ideals are ultimately real, and different from non-ideal things—indeed, he argued for a distinction between the ideal and non-ideal realm.

These commentators speak thus: for example, a particular tree, with a branch or two missing, possibly alive, possibly dead, and with the initials of two lovers carved into its bark, is distinct from the abstract form of Tree-ness.&lt;ref name=caps/&gt; A Tree&lt;ref name=caps/&gt; is the ideal that each of us holds that allows us to identify the imperfect reflections of trees all around us.

Plato gives the [[The divided line of Plato| divided line]] as an outline of this theory.  At the top of the line, the [[Form of the Good]]&lt;ref name="caps"&gt;
  In the field of philosophy, it has been customary to capitalize
  words that are concept names, such as "Search for Truth" (or
  "Goodness" or "Man"). Common ideals are Truth, Kindness, and
  Beauty. Such capitalization is not common in science, and
  hence, concepts such as "accuracy" and "gravity" are not often
  capitalized in scientific writing, but could be
  capitalized in philosophical papers.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is found, directing everything underneath.

Some contemporary linguistic philosophers construe "Platonism" to mean the proposition that [[universals]] exist independently of particulars (a universal is anything that can be predicated of a particular).

Platonism is an ancient school of [[philosophy]], founded by Plato; at the beginning, this school had a physical existence at a site just outside the walls of [[History of Athens|Athens]] called the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]], as well as the intellectual unity of a shared approach to philosophizing.

Platonism is usually divided into three periods:

# Early [[Platonism]]
# [[Middle Platonism]]
# [[Neoplatonism]]

Plato's students used the [[Hypomnema|hypomnemata]] as the foundation to his philosophical approach to [[knowledge]]. The hypomnemata constituted a material memory of things read, heard, or thought, thus offering these as an accumulated treasure for rereading and later meditation. For the Neoplatonist they also formed a raw material for the writing of more systematic treatises in which were given arguments and means by which to struggle against some defect (such as anger, envy, gossip, flattery) or to overcome some difficult circumstance (such as a mourning, an exile, downfall, disgrace).

Platonism is considered to be, in mathematics departments the world over, the predominant [[philosophy of mathematics]], especially regarding the [[foundations of mathematics]].

One statement of this philosophy is the thesis that mathematics is not created but discovered.
A lucid statement of this is found in an essay written by the British mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] in defense of pure mathematics. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanscientist.org/article/in-defense-of-pure-mathematics|title=In Defense of Pure Mathematics|date=2017-02-06|work=American Scientist|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Mathematician_s_Apology.html?id=beImvXUGD-MC|title=A Mathematician's Apology|last=Hardy|first=G. H.|date=1992-01-31|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521427067|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence in this thesis of clear distinction between mathematical and non-mathematical "creation" leaves open the inference that it applies to allegedly creative endeavors in art, music, and literature.

It is unknown if Plato's ideas of [[idealism]] have some earlier origin, but Plato held [[Pythagoras]] in high regard, and Pythagoras as well as his followers in the movement known as [[Pythagoreanism]] claimed the world was literally built up from numbers, an abstract, absolute form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19132">A '''post-detection policy''' ('''PDP'''), also known as a '''post-detection [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]]''', is a set of structured rules, standards, guidelines, or actions that [[government]]al or other organizational entities plan to follow for the "detection, analysis, verification, announcement, and response to" confirmed signals from [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilizations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SETI Protocols|url=http://www.setileague.org/iaaseti/protocol.htm|work=SETI Permanent Study Group|publisher=International Academy of Astronautics|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though no PDPs have been formally and openly adopted by any governmental entity, there is significant work being done by scientists and [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental organizations]] to develop cohesive plans of action to utilize in the event of detection. The most popular and well known of these is the “Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence", which was developed by the [[International Academy of Astronautics]] (IAA), with the support of the International Institute of Space Law.&lt;ref name="extraterrestrial1999"&gt;Billingham, John et al. 1999. Social Implications of the Detection of an Extraterrestrial Civilization (SETI Press, Mountain View, CA).&lt;/ref&gt; The theories of PDPs constitute a distinct area of research but draw heavily from the fields of [[SETI|SETI (the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)]], [[Active SETI|METI (Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)]], and [[Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence|CETI (Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence)]].

Scientist Zbigniew Paptrotny has argued that the formulation of post-detection protocols can be guided by three factors: terrestrial society's readiness to accept the news of ET detection, how the news of detection is released, and the comprehensibility of the message in the signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paprotny, Zbigniew |title=Signals from ETI detected — What next?|doi=10.1016/0094-5765(90)90133-6|bibcode=1987brig.iafcQ....P|year=1990|journal=Acta Astronautica|volume=21|issue=2|pages=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three broad areas and their related subsidiaries comprise the bulk of the content and discourse surrounding PDPs.

==Issues==

===Significance of transmission===
There are two proposed [[Scale (descriptive set theory)|scales]] for [[Quantification (science)|quantifying]] the significance of transmissions between Earth and potential extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI). The Rio Scale, ranging from 0 to 10, was proposed in 2000 as a means of quantifying the significance of a SETI detection. The scale was designed by Iván Almár and [[Jill Tarter]] to help policy-makers formulate an initial judgment on a detection’s potential consequences.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Michaud, Michael A.G. |title=Ten decisions that could shake the world|journal=Space Policy|volume=19|issue=2|year=2003|pages=131–136|doi=10.1016/S0265-9646(03)00019-5|url=http://www.setileague.org/iaaseti/decision.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale borrows heavily from the [[Torino Scale]], which is used to categorize the hazard of impact of [[Near-Earth object|near-earth objects]] (NEOs). The IAA SETI Permanent Study Group officially adopted this scale both as a means of bringing perspective to claims of ETI detection and as an acknowledgement that even false ETI detections could have disastrous consequences, which should be mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setileague.org/iaaseti/rioscale.htm IAA SETI Permanent Study Group: Rio Scale]. Setileague.org (2006-09-29). Retrieved on 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related metric is the [[San Marino Scale]] for quantifying potential hazard of deliberate transmissions from Earth. While the Rio Scale rests on the relatively well-accepted science of the search for extraterrestrial signals (SETI), the San Marino scale seeks to bring objectivity to the reciprocal enterprise – that of human civilization sending transmissions that could be found by extraterrestrial civilizations (METI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The San Marino Scale: a new analytical tool for assessing transmission risk|journal= Acta Astronautica|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.04.012|bibcode=2007AcAau..60...57A|year=2007|last1=Almar|first1=I|last2=Paulshuch|first2=H|volume=60|pages=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The San Marino Scale was first proposed in 2005 and was adopted by the IAA SETI Permanent Study Group in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setileague.org/iaaseti/smiscale.htm IAA SETI Permanent Study Group: San Marino Scale]. Setileague.org. Retrieved on 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature of detection===
Despite widespread belief, there is no [[Empirical|empirical knowledge]] concerning extraterrestrial life forms and civilizations. The implications of a detection of extraterrestrial life would vary greatly depending on the nature of that life, its location, and how human society reacts. Because of this lack of certainty, PDPs consider a variety of scenarios and the appropriate reactions. The formulation of a cohesive plan for a response to the detection of ETI would involve the development of [[Scenario planning|scenario-contingent strategies]] for managing the discovery and its consequences.

Some scenarios have received more attention than have others. For example, while a sizable amount of work has been done to predict the consequences of a [[radio telescope]] detection of ETI elsewhere in our galaxy, very little such effort has been used to identify the consequences of discovering [[Unicellular organism|single-celled life forms]] elsewhere in the [[Solar System]]. Confirmation of such [[fossil]]ized or living organisms on a nearby [[planet]] or [[moon]] could still have acute effects on individuals’ world-views and raise many ethical and practical issues.&lt;ref&gt;Dick, Steven K. “Response to the Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life.” (1999). Workshop on the Societal Implications of Astrobiology: Final Report. Ames Research Center: NASA Technical Memorandum (Final Report revised on January 20, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural and political considerations===
{{main|Cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact}}
Regardless of the nature of a confirmed detection, PDPs also place considerable emphasis on the range of likely reactions from different constituencies, including the press, various religious groups, political leaders, and the general public. The differences in reactions across the range of cultural and religious boundaries would be substantial. One possible strategy for development of more comprehensive PDPs is to undertake carefully planned [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural polls and other empirical studies]] based on analogues in the [[humanities]] and [[history]], the [[Social sciences|social]] and [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral sciences]], and even [[science fiction]] to determine likely reactions. Shortly after a confirmed detection, the timely application of relevant [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] data is likely to prove invaluable in implementing the appropriate policy as well as in the delivery of educational and [[public relations]] initiatives particular to the situation at hand.&lt;ref&gt;Vakoch, Douglas A. “Predicting Reactions to the Detection of Life beyond Earth.” (1999). Workshop on the Societal Implications of Astrobiology: Final Report. Ames Research Center: NASA Technical Memorandum (Final Report revised on January 20, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Another potential strategy is to explore the capacity of religion as a “resource to absorb the impact of discovery and to maintain beneficial relations with ETI.”&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Albert A., and Kathleen Connell (Eds.) (1999). Workshop on the Societal Implications of Astrobiology: Final Report. Ames Research Center: NASA Technical Memorandum (Final Report revised on January 20, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

PDPs also attempt to take into account the political aftermath of a detection and the ways in which both governmental and nongovernmental entities might use information. As Michael Michaud states, “We cannot assume that SETI is immune from the ancient motivations of egoism, power, and greed. Decisions that could affect the welfare of the human species might be made by small, non-representative elites.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

Once detection becomes public, decision-makers would exert influence by the way they evaluate the importance and handle the publicity of the discovery. It is possible that such actors would emphasize or minimize its importance to extract political advantage. The contact could be framed as a positive development that will benefit the nation and humankind. Likewise, it could be used to warn of potential dangers and provoke public anxieties. Each course of action would have profound effects on how the press and the general public react. Michaud posits that the more decipherable the information received from contact with ETI, the higher a chance there is for political reaction against alien cultural influences. [[Extremism|Extremist groups]], both religious and secular, could weigh in, attacking information from ETI as evil or immoral. It is possible that this would spark attempts to terminate communication by interfering with the signal or targeting the detecting technology with attacks. [[Albert Harrison (psychologist)|Albert Harrison]] has written that it would be “foolish and negligent” to fail to anticipate such reactions in the formulation of policies and plans.&lt;ref&gt;Albert A. Harrison, “Rethinking our Place in the Universe: Exploring the Societal Implications of NASA’s Astrobiology Program,” Space Times, January–February 2002, 4–9, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information sharing===
Following a confirmed detection, another important variable considered in a PDP is the speed with which the facts of the discovery would become public knowledge. For instance, should a signal of ET origin be sufficiently ambiguous or otherwise difficult to interpret, the detecting party may perceive a need to withhold information about the discovery to prevent unintended reactions from the general public or other political entities. Likewise, the detecting party could choose to limit information release in a bid to exploit the contact for personal gain.

At the [[international|international level]], the PDP of a [[Central government|national government entity]] would have the [[Legal authority|force of law]] to prevent, delay, or limit the release of information – especially if the detection is made by persons working for that agency or [[Government contractor|under government contract]]. This sort of information restriction scenario is more likely under circumstances in which the detecting party was the only holder of the technological capabilities required to communicate. The subsequent disclosure of those decisions could provoke international distrust, encouraging other nations to act unilaterally in their communication with ETI.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

===Signal comprehensibility and content===
{{Main|Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence}}
Depending on the nature of the first detection, policy- or decision-makers might have the opportunity to make a conscious decision about composing and sending a message. The ambiguity and content of signals sent both to and from Earth would have profound implications for what actions needed to be taken. A PDP that did not take signal comprehensibility into account would not be flexible enough to inform appropriate action. The area of SETI research known as CETI (Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence), is concerned with how humankind should carry out this communication and, to some extent, representation problems such as whether a response should be with one collective voice or if anyone with access to a transmitter should have the right to communicate.

The purpose and content of a response is also an issue that PDPs seek to make explicit. There is considerable disagreement as to how to effectively communicate meaning and intent across what would likely be formidable [[language barrier]]s. The message would need to be crafted in such a way that its content and delivery were unambiguous to receivers that may not even use written or verbal communication. Several [[mathematics|mathematic]], [[Pictorial language#Pictorial languages|pictorial]], [[ALGOL|algorithmic]], and [[Natural language|"natural"]] language theories have been developed and applied to the problem of CETI. A specific purpose or goal of outgoing transmissions may be covered by a PDP as well. Several possible functions exist, including: a description of our species and planet, a request for information, and/or the proposition of some course of action. However, in the absence of an [[Treaty|intergovernmental agreement]] or structures for building consensus on the subject, nations, groups, and individuals are free to act [[Autonomy|autonomously]]. It is precisely because the process of sculpting a collective message would be slow and laborious (but intensely important), that most scientists recommend having a PDP with some prescribed action laid out before contact is made.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

===Relative technological capabilities===
In considering post-detection courses of action, it is also useful to consider the relative technological capabilities both in relation to signal relay time and in relation to whether or not the ETI is thought to pose a militaristic threat. If the ETI in question is transmitting from outside the Solar System, there will be a significant lag in time between transmission and receipt by either party. The relative sophistication of the communication technology available to each party would play heavily into the feasibility of certain types and content of messaging. In a similar vein, the potential disparities in sophistication of weapons technology hold grave implications for how humankind should react to ETI. Due to the perceived risk of revealing the precise location of the Earth to alien civilizations, METI has been heavily criticized as irresponsible considering the lack of information available about any real or potential ETI threat. Even in the likely scenario that accurate locational coordinates of Earth were available, there is question as to whether humankind should reveal anything more about itself that could be a boon to hostile ETI. Notable among the critics of METI are British theoretical physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] and science fiction author [[David Brin]].

==Adopted and Proposed PDPs==

===The Brookings Report===
{{main|Brookings Report}}
"[[Brookings Report|Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs]]," often referred to as "the Brookings Report," was a 1960 report commissioned by [[NASA]] and created by the [[Brookings Institution]] in collaboration with NASA's Committee on Long-Range Studies. In a section titled, "The implications of a discovery of extraterrestrial life," the report considers possible post-detection scenarios and gives recommendations. Aimed at the political leadership that would be in a decision-making role immediately following a confirmed detection, it describes, among other things, the circumstances under which it may or may not be advisable to withhold such information from the public. The significance of this relatively small section of the report is a matter of controversy. As more of an analysis of fallout and pertinent considerations than an explicit PDP, the report does not specifically recommend a cover-up of evidence of extraterrestrial life. This possibility, however, is the context in which the Brookings report is often cited by ufologists and conspiracy theorists.

===IAA SETI Declaration of Principles===
The IAA, in an attempt to draw up universal guidelines on the immediate steps to be taken by the group or individual that makes a discovery, drafted the "Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setileague.org/iaaseti/protdet.htm "Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence"] ar setileague.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  The document has been endorsed by six international professional space societies and also constitutes an informal agreement among most of those carrying out SETI.&lt;ref name="extraterrestrial1999"/&gt;
The declaration proposes a set of nine post-detection protocols, listed below.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#International consultations should be initiated to consider the question of sending communications to extraterrestrial civilizations.
#Consultations on whether a message should be sent, and its content, should take place within the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space of the United Nations and within other governmental and non-governmental organizations, and should accommodate participation by qualified, interested groups that can contribute constructively to these consultations.
#These consultations should be open to participation by all interested States and should be intended to lead to recommendations reflecting a consensus.
#The United Nations General Assembly should consider making the decision on whether or not to send a message to extraterrestrial intelligence, and on what the content of that message should be, based on recommendations from the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and from governmental and non-governmental organizations.
#If a decision is made to send a message to extraterrestrial intelligence, it should be sent on behalf of all Humankind, rather than from individual States.
#The content of such a message should reflect a careful concern for the broad interests and wellbeing of Humanity, and should be made available to the public in advance of transmission.
#As the sending of a communication to extraterrestrial intelligence could lead to an exchange of communications separated by many years, consideration should be given to a long-term institutional framework for such communications.
#No communication to extraterrestrial intelligence should be sent by any State until appropriate international consultations have taken place. States should not cooperate with attempts to communicate with extraterrestrial intelligence that do not conform to the principles of this Declaration.
#In their deliberations on these questions, States participating in this Declaration and United Nations bodies should draw on the expertise of scientists, scholars, and other persons with relevant knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setileague.org/iaaseti/reply.htm IAA SETI Permanent Study Group: Proposed SETI Reply Protocols]. Setileague.org (2004-01-25). Retrieved on 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The document does not, however, carry the force of law or any other regulatory power.  Hence it can be ignored by public or private institutions should they choose to, without legal repercussions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

[[File:Queenie.JPG|thumb| Children on Queenie The Elephant at Melbourne Zoo, 1917]]

'''Queenie''' was an elephant who was used to give rides for children at [[Melbourne Zoo]] for 40 years.

Queenie was a very popular exhibit, with large crowds of children often gathering around her enclosure even when she was not giving rides. She was often teased by children and her keeper, Andrew Wilkie, said she would retaliate by using her trunk to "tumble such trespassers over in the dust". 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On one occasion, a group of about fifteen schoolboys were teasing Queenie by offering her nuts and fruit in turn and then withdrawing the food just as she reached for it. This game continued for a while until the elephant retreated to the pool behind her house. She returned some minutes later and, imitating their behaviour, held out her trunk to each boy in turn, withdrawing it before they would touch it. The boys were delighted with this variation of the game until, as if carrying out a pre-planned attack, she soaked them all thoroughly with a well-aimed spray of dirty water from her pool."

'''Richard M. Capobianco''' is an American philosophy professor and one of the leading commentators on the thought of the 20th century German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]]. His two books, ''Engaging Heidegger'' and ''Heidegger's Way of Being'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonehill.edu/directory/richard-capobianco/publications-research/ Publications &amp; Research by Richard M. Capobianco]&lt;/ref&gt; have led the way to a renewed appreciation of Heidegger's core concern with Being as temporal radiant emergence or manifestation. He has also brought Heidegger into closer proximity with American authors such as [[Walt Whitman]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[John Muir]], and [[E. E. Cummings]], and with English poets such as [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]].

==Background==
Capobianco received a B.A. in Economics and Philosophy from [[Hofstra University]] in 1979. He was inducted into [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1978. He is currently a Professor of Philosophy at [[Stonehill College]] in North Easton, MA. He earned his M.A. and Ph.D. in Philosophy at [[Boston College]], where his principal teacher and mentor was the preeminent Heidegger commentator [[William J. Richardson]], who also wrote the Foreword to his book ''Engaging Heidegger''. Capobianco teaches courses on [[Existentialism]], [[Hermeneutics]], [[American Philosophy]], and Aesthetics, and he has received several awards for teaching excellence, including a national recognition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonehill.edu/academics/areas-of-study/philosophy/stonehill-professors-featured-/ Stonehill Professors Featured in “The Best 300 Professors” by Princeton Review]&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Princeton Review]].

'''Richard John Seddon''' {{postnominals|country=NZL|size=100%|PC}} (22 June 1845 – 10 June 1906) was a New Zealand politician who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|15th Premier (Prime Minister) of New Zealand]] from 1893 until his death in office in 1906. 

First active in local politics, Seddon entered the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] as the member for [[Hokitika (New Zealand electorate)|Hokitika]] in 1879. Seddon became a key member of the nascent [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] under the leadership of [[John Ballance]]. When the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]] came to power in 1891 Seddon was appointed to several portfolios, including [[Minister of Works (New Zealand)|Minister of Public Works]].

Seddon succeeded to the leadership of the Liberal Party following Ballance's death in 1893, inheriting a bill for [[women's suffrage in New Zealand|women's suffrage]], which was passed the same year. Seddon's government achieved many social and economic changes, such as the introduction of [[old age pension]]s. An [[imperialist]] in foreign policy, his attempt to incorporate [[Fiji]] into New Zealand failed, but he successfully annexed the [[Cook Islands]] in 1901. He also purchased vast amounts of land from the [[Māori people|Māori]]. Seddon's government supported Britain with troops in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902) and supported preferential trade between British colonies. 

In office for thirteen years, Seddon is to date New Zealand's [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand by time in office|longest-serving head of government]]. Sometimes derisively known as "King Dick" for his autocratic style,{{sfn|Hamer|2014|p=1}} he has nonetheless been lauded as one of the greatest, most influential, and most widely known politicians in New Zealand history.

==Early life and family==
Seddon was born in [[Eccleston, St Helens|Eccleston]] near [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens, Lancashire, England]] in 1845. His father Thomas Seddon (born 1817) was a school headmaster, and his mother Jane Lindsay was a teacher. They married on 8 February 1842 at Christ Church, Eccleston. Richard was the third of their eight children.

Despite this background, Seddon did not perform well at school, and was described as unruly. Despite his parents' attempt to give him a [[classics|classical]] education, Seddon developed an interest in engineering, but was removed from school at age 12. After working on his grandfather Richard's farm at [[Barrow Nook]] Hall for two years,{{sfn|Brooking|2014|p=17}} Seddon was an apprentice at [[Robert Daglish|Daglish's]] [[Foundry]] in St Helens. He later worked at [[George Forrester and Company|Vauxhall foundry]] in [[Liverpool]],{{sfn|Hamer|2014|p=1}} where he attained a Board of Trade Certificate as a mechanical engineer.{{sfn|Brooking|2014|p=51}}

On 15 June 1862, at the age of 16, Seddon decided to emigrate to [[Australia]], on the [[SS Great Britain]].{{sfn|Brooking|2014|p=13}} He later provided his reasoning: "A restlessness to get away to see new, broad lands seized me: My work was irksome. I felt cramped."{{sfn|Brooking|2014|p=54}} He entered the railway workshops at [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]. He was caught by the gold fever and went to [[Bendigo]], where he spent some time in the diggings. He did not meet with any great success. In either 1865 or 1866, he became engaged to Louisa Jane Spotswood, but her family would not permit marriage until Seddon was more financially secure.

In 1866, Seddon moved to New Zealand's [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]]. Initially, he worked the goldfields in [[Waimea, New Zealand|Waimea]]. He is believed to have prospered here, and he returned briefly to Melbourne to marry Louisa. He established a store, and then expanded his business to include the sale of alcohol, becoming a [[Public house|publican]]. He was followed to the West Coast by his older sister Phoebe, younger brothers Edward and Jim and younger sister Mary.{{sfn|Brooking|2014|p=2}} Phoebe married William Cunliffe on 9 May 1863 at Holy Trinity Church Eccleston. Their son Bill was Labour MP [[David Cunliffe]]'s grandfather, making Richard Seddon David Cunliffe's great-great-uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.greystar.co.nz/content/cunliffe%E2%80%99s-great-uncle-dick|title=Cunliffe’s great-uncle Dick|work=Grey Star|date=|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local politics==
Seddon's first real involvement with politics was with various local bodies, such as the Arahura Road Board. In 1874 elected to the council of [[Westland Province]], representing Arahura. He lost this position with the [[Provinces of New Zealand|abolition of the provinces]] in 1876.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=100}} Gradually, Seddon became known along the West Coast as an advocate for miners' rights and interests, and he was frequently consulted over various political issues.

In 1877, Seddon was elected as the first Mayor of [[Kumara, New Zealand|Kumara]], which was to become a prominent goldmining town. He had staked a claim in Kumara the previous year, and had shortly afterwards moved his business there. Despite occasional financial troubles (he filed for bankruptcy in 1878{{sfn|Burdon|1955|p=40}}), his political career prospered.

Seddon first sought election to the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] in the [[New Zealand general election, 1875–76|1876 election]], standing for the [[Hokitika (New Zealand electorate)|Hokitika]] electorate. In the two-member electorate, he came fourth out of five candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Declaration of the Poll | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=WCT18760119.2.7 | accessdate=20 February 2015 | work=West Coast Times | issue=3219 | date=19 January 1876 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Zealand general election, 1879|1879 election]], he tried again, and was elected. He represented Hokitika to 1881, then [[Kumara (New Zealand electorate)|Kumara]] from 1881 to 1890, then [[Westland (New Zealand electorate)|Westland]] from 1890 to his death in 1906. His son [[Tom Seddon]] succeeded him as MP for Westland.

In Parliament, Seddon aligned himself with [[George Grey]], a former [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor]] turned Premier. Seddon later claimed to be particularly close to Grey, although some historians believe that this was an invention for political purposes. Initially, Seddon was derided by many members of Parliament, who mocked his "provincial" accent (which tended to drop the letter "h") and his lack of formal education. He nevertheless proved quite effective in Parliament, being particularly good at "stonewalling" certain legislation. His political focus was on issues of concern to his West Coast constituents. He specialised on mining issues, became a recognised authority on the topic, and chaired the goldfields committee in 1887 and 1888.{{sfn|Hamer|2006|p=}}

He aggressively proclaimed a populist anti-elitist philosophy in many speeches and toast. "It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy people and the landowners against the middle classes and the labouring classes," he explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[New Zealand House of Representatives]]|title=Parliamentary Debates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9roDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA171|year=1884|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberal Party==
{{main article|New Zealand Liberal Party}}
Seddon joined the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], led by [[John Ballance]], following the [[New Zealand general election, 1890|December 1890]] general election. Their platform was for reform in the areas of land and labour.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=89}} They were greatly helped by the abolition of [[plural voting]], which allowed landowners in each district they owned land in to vote in them.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=89}}

Seddon was sworn into his first [[Ministers of the New Zealand Government|ministerial]] positions when the Liberals came to power in January 1891.{{sfn|Hamer|2014|p=1}} He became  minister of public works, mines, defence, and marine. He promoted co-operative contract system for road-making and other public works projects.

Unlike Ballance who believed in [[classical liberalism]], Seddon did not have any great commitment to any ideology. Rather, he saw the Liberals as champions of "the common man" against large commercial interests and major landowners. His strong advocacy for what he saw as the interests of ordinary New Zealanders won him considerable popularity. Attacks by the opposition, which generally focused on his lack of education and sophistication (one opponent said that he was only "partially civilised") reinforced his growing reputation as an enemy of elitism.

Seddon quickly became popular across the country. Some of his colleagues, however, were not as happy, accusing him of putting [[populism]] ahead of principle, and of being an [[anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]]. John Ballance, now Premier, had a deep commitment to liberal causes such as [[women's suffrage]] and [[Māori people|Māori]] rights, which Seddon was not always as enthusiastic about. Nevertheless, many people in the Liberal Party believed that Seddon's popularity was a huge asset for the party, and Seddon developed a substantial following.

{{see also|Liberal Government of New Zealand}}
In 1892, Ballance fell seriously ill and made Seddon acting leader of the House. After Ballance's death in April 1893, the Governor [[David Boyle, 7th Earl of Glasgow]] asked Seddon, as the acting leader of the house, to form a new ministry. Despite the refusal of [[William Pember Reeves]] and [[Thomas Mackenzie]] to accept his leadership, Seddon managed to secure the backing of his Liberal Party colleagues as interim leader, with an understanding being reached that a full vote would occur when Parliament resumed sitting. Seddon's most prominent challenger was [[Robert Stout]], a former Premier for two separate terms. Like Ballance, Stout had a strong belief in classical liberal principles. Ballance himself had preferred Stout as his successor, but had died before being able to secure this aim. Stout was not a member of the House of Representatives at the time of Ballance's death, and only re-entered following the [[Inangahua by-election, 1893|by-election in Inangahua]] on 8 June 1893.

Despite Seddon's promise, however, there was no vote on the party leadership and therefore the premiership. By convincing his party colleagues that a leadership contest would split the party in two, or at least leave deep divisions, Seddon managed to secure a permanent hold on the leadership. Stout continued to be one of his strongest critics and led the campaign for women's suffrage despite Seddon's opposition. Eventually Stout left the Liberal Party in 1896 and remained in the house as an independent until 1898. In 1899 however, Seddon recommended Stout to the Governor as the next [[Chief Justice of New Zealand]].

=== Women's suffrage ===

{{main article|Women's suffrage in New Zealand}}
John Ballance, founder of the Liberal Party, had been a strong supporter of voting rights for women, declaring his belief in the "absolute equality of the sexes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/2b5/ballance-john|title=Story: Ballance, John|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|date=4 June 2013|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time women's suffrage was closely linked to the [[Temperance movement in New Zealand|temperance movement]], which sought prohibition of alcohol. As a former publican and self-styled "[[Champion of the Common Man]]" Seddon initially opposed women's suffrage. In July 1893, two months after Seddon became Premier, the second of two major [[1893 Women's Suffrage Petition|petitions for women's suffrage]] was presented to the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/womens-suffrage/about-the-petition|title=Women and the vote Page 7 – About the suffrage petition|date=|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This resulted in considerable debate within the Liberal Party. [[John Hall (New Zealand politician)|John Hall]], a former conservative premier, moved a Bill to enact women's suffrage. Seddon's opponents within the party, led by Stout (also an advocate of temperance), managed to gather enough support for the Bill to be passed despite Seddon's opposition. When Seddon realised that the passage of the bill was inevitable, he changed his position, claiming to accept the people's will. In actuality, however, he took strong measures to ensure that the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] would vote down the Bill, as it had done previously. Seddon's tactics in lobbying the Council were seen by many as underhand, and two Councillors, despite opposing suffrage, voted in favour of the bill in protest. The Bill was granted [[Royal Assent]] in September.

Nonetheless, at the [[New Zealand general election, 1893|1893 general election]] in November, Seddon's Liberal Party managed to increase its majority.

=== Alcohol licensing ===

{{main article|Alcohol in New Zealand}}
The debate on women's suffrage exposed deep divisions within the Liberal Party between more doctrinaire liberals, broadly led by Stout, and "popular" liberals, led by Seddon. This division was again highlighted by the debate over alcohol licensing. Seddon moved the radical Alcoholic Liquors Sale Control Bill in 1893&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/prohibition/page-4|title=PROHIBITION - The Act of 1893|publisher=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]|date=1966|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to introduce licensing districts where a majority could vote for continuance (continued liquor licensing in that district) or reduction of licences or no liquor licences at all. Votes were to be taken every three years at general elections and licensing districts were matched to electoral districts.
{{see also|New Zealand alcohol licensing referendums 1894–1987}}

=== Old-age pensions ===
One of the policies for which Seddon is most remembered is his Old-age Pensions Act of 1898, which established the basis of the [[welfare state]] later expanded by [[Michael Joseph Savage]] and the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]. Seddon put considerable weight behind the scheme, despite considerable opposition from many quarters. Its successful passage is often seen as a testament to Seddon's political power and influence.

=== Foreign policy ===
In the sphere of foreign policy, Seddon was a notable supporter of the [[British Empire]]. After he attended the [[First Colonial Conference|Colonial Conference in London in 1897]], he became known "as one of the pillars of British imperialism", and he was a strong supporter of the [[Second Boer War]] and sponsored preferential tariffs for trade with Britain. He is also noted for his support of New Zealand's own "imperial" designs – Seddon believed that New Zealand should play a major role in the [[Pacific Islands]] as a "Britain of the South". Seddon's plans focused mainly on establishing New Zealand dominion over [[Fiji]] and [[Samoa]]. However, his expansionist policies were discouraged by the [[British Government|Imperial Government]]. Only the [[Cook Islands]] came under New Zealand's control during his term in office.&lt;ref name="ENZ 1966"/&gt;

=== Immigration ===
{{Main|New Zealand head tax}}
Although Chinese immigrants were invited to New Zealand by the Dunedin Chamber of Commerce, prejudice against them quickly led to calls for restrictions on immigration. Following the example of anti-Chinese poll taxes enacted by California in 1852 and by Australian states in the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s, [[John Hall (New Zealand)|John Hall]]'s government passed the Chinese Immigration Act 1881. This imposed a £10 tax per Chinese person entering New Zealand, and permitted only one Chinese immigrant for every 10 tons of cargo. Richard Seddon's government increased the tax to £100 per head in 1896, and tightened the other restriction to only one Chinese immigrant for every 200 tons of cargo.

Seddon compared the Chinese people to monkeys, and so used the Yellow Peril to promote [[Racialism|racialist]] politics in New Zealand. In 1879, in his first political speech, Seddon said that New Zealand did not wish her shores "deluged with Asiatic Tartars. I would sooner address white men than these Chinese. You can't talk to them, you can't reason with them. All you can get from them is 'No savvy'."&lt;ref&gt;Burdon, Randal Mathews. ''King Dick: A Biography of Richard John Seddon'', Whitcombe &amp; Tombs, 1955, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style of government===
[[File:Richard John Seddon addressing a Liberal rally at Greytown, late 1890s.jpg|thumb|left|Seddon (far right) addressing a Liberal rally in [[Greytown, New Zealand|Greytown]], late 1890s]]
[[File:Richard John Seddon, Vanity Fair, 1902-04-17.jpg|right|thumb|Seddon caricatured by How for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1902]]
Seddon was a strong premier, and enforced his authority with great vigour. At one point, he even commented that "A president is all we require", and that [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet]] could be abolished. His opponents, both within the Liberal Party and in opposition, accused him of being an autocrat – the label "King Dick" was first applied to him at this point.

Seddon accumulated a large number of portfolios for himself, including that of [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] (from which he displaced [[Joseph Ward]]), [[Minister of Labour (New Zealand)|Minister of Labour]] (from which he displaced [[William Pember Reeves]]), [[Minister of Education (New Zealand)|Minister of Education]], [[Minister of Defence (New Zealand)|Minister of Defence]], [[Minister of Māori Affairs|Minister of Native Affairs]], and [[Minister of Immigration (New Zealand)|Minister of Immigration]].

Seddon was also accused of [[cronyism]] – his friends and allies, particularly those from the West Coast, were given various political positions, while his enemies within the Liberal Party were frequently denied important office. Many of Seddon's appointees were not qualified for the positions that they received – Seddon valued loyalty above ability. One account, possibly apocryphal, claims that he installed an ally as a senior civil servant despite the man being illiterate. He was also accused of [[nepotism]] – in 1905, it was claimed that one of his sons had received an unauthorised payment, but this claim was proved false.

Sir [[Carl Berendsen]] recalled seeing Seddon in 1906 as a Department of Education junior innocently bearing what was an unwelcome document. A replacement was needed for a small native school. The inspectors had picked out three outstanding candidates, but Seddon picked out the last on the lengthy list; he had no academic qualifications and had just been released from gaol for embezzlement. When the Premier appointed the gentlemen from gaol, Departmental officials returned the papers and called attention to his criminal record. Berendsen cowered in the corner while with a snarl Seddon grasped his pen and wrote once more in very large letters, "Appoint Mr X". Berendsen noted though that when an Editor was required for the new School Journal, Departmental officials had agreed on the best man, but the Massey Government (which had replaced the Liberal Government) was "quite shameless in devotion to the principle of the loaves and fishes ... and the Minister of the day appointed the third choice".{{sfn|Berendsen|2009|pp=50, 56}}

As Minister of Native Affairs, Seddon took a generally "sympathetic" but "[[paternalism|paternalistic]]" approach. As Minister of Immigration, he was well known for his hostility to Chinese immigration – the so-called "[[Yellow Peril]]" was an important part of his populist rhetoric, and he compared Chinese people to [[monkey]]s. In his first political speech in 1879 he had declared New Zealand did not wish her shores to be "deluged with Asiatic Tartars. I would sooner address white men than these Chinese. You can't talk to them, you can't reason with them. All you can get from them is 'No savvy'."

Successive governments had also shown a lack of firmness in dealing with Maori, he said:  "The colony, instead of importing [[Gatling gun]]s with which to fight Maori, should wage war with locomotives" ... pushing through roads and railways and compulsorily purchasing "the land on both sides".{{sfn|Scott|1975|loc=chpt. 10&lt;!-- the loc parameter should really be replace with a page range, e.g. "pp=72–86" --&gt;}}

==Freemasonry==
In 1868, Seddon became a [[Freemason]], being initiated into the Pacific Lodge in Hokitika.&lt;ref name="ENZ 1966"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burdon |first=Randal Mathews |authorlink=Randal Mathews Burdon |editor-last=McLintock |editor-first=A.H. |title=An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand | chapter=Seddon, Richard John |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/seddon-richard-john |accessdate=21 February 2015 |year=1966 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, while premier, he was elected Grand Master of New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/31274/richard-seddon-grand-master |title=Richard Seddon, Grand Master |date=16 November 2012 |website=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served in that role for two years.&lt;ref name="ENZ 1966"/&gt;

== Honours ==
Seddon attended Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and received her [[Queen Victoria Diamond Jubilee Medal|Jubilee Medal]] and an appointment in the [[Privy Council]]. In 1902 he attended the [[coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra]] and received his [[King Edward VII Coronation Medal|Coronation Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=1068571912|title=Object: Queen Victoria Diamond Jubilee Medal, 1897|publisher=[[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same visit, he received the [[Freedom of the Borough]] of his home-town St Helens during a visit there in July 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Mr. Seddon at St Helens |day_of_week=Monday |date=7 July 1900 |page_number=4 |issue=36813| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Freedom of the City of [[Edinburgh]] and an honorary degree [[LL.D.]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]] during a visit to the city later the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Colonial Premiers in Edinburgh |day_of_week=Monday |date=28 July 1902 |page_number=4 |issue=36831| }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also presented with the Honorary [[Freedom of the City|Freedom]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Tallow Chandlers]] on 8 August 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Mr Seddon at the Tallow Chandler´s Company|day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 August 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36842| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He twice refused a knighthood, wanting to be seen as a man of the people.&lt;ref name="nzhistory"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gavin McLean|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/richard-seddon|title=Richard Seddon - Biography|publisher=nzhistory.net.nz|accessdate=5 February 2015|date=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[Image:Richardseddongrave.JPG|thumbnail|250px|right|Richard Seddon's grave in [[Bolton Street Memorial Park]], [[Wellington]].]]
Seddon remained Prime Minister for 13 years, but gradually, calls for him to retire became more frequent. Various attempts to replace him with [[Joseph Ward]] met with failure.

In June 1906, while returning from a trip to Australia on the ship ''Oswestry Grange'', Seddon had a massive heart attack and died suddenly 12 days before his 61st birthday.{{sfn|Brooker|2014|p=261}} News of his death provoked numerous public gestures of grief, which included black-bordered displays in shop windows and several public monuments, including a memorial lamp post outside the St Helens Hospital in Pitt Street Auckland. Seddon was buried in [[Wellington]]'s [[Bolton Street Memorial Park]], with his grave being marked by a large monument.

==Legacy==
[[File:Portrait of Richard John Seddon 1907 by EVM.jpg|thumb|left|1907 portrait by [[Ellen von Meyern]]]]
[[File:Parliament House (Statue of Richard John Seddon 1845-1906).JPG|thumb|upright|Richard Seddon's statue stands outside Parliament Buildings in Wellington.]]
He is considered by academics and historians to be one of New Zealand's greatest and most revered Prime Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who was our best Prime Minister? {{!}} Jesse Mulligan, 1–4pm,  2:30 pm on  8 September 2016 {{!}} RNZ|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/afternoons/audio/201815361/who-was-our-best-prime-minister|publisher=Radio New Zealand|language=en-nz|date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Seddon's son [[Thomas Seddon (politician)|Thomas]] replaced him as MP for [[Westland (New Zealand electorate)|Westland]] in the by-election following his death. When Thomas met former [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1918, he expressed admiration for his late father, particularly the labour legislation his government passed.{{sfn|Seddon|1968|p=299}}

A statue of Seddon is located outside Parliament Buildings, and another has a prominent position in the West Coast town of [[Hokitika]]. A [[Seddon, New Zealand|town in New Zealand]] and a [[Seddon, Victoria|suburb]] of Melbourne, Australia are named after him. Wellington Zoo was originally created when a young lion was presented to Prime Minister Richard Seddon by the Bostock and Wombwell Circus. Seddon created the Zoo from this single specimen and the lion was later named King Dick in the Prime Minister's honour. The stuffed body of King Dick (the lion) is displayed on the ground floor of the [[Museum of Wellington City &amp; Sea]]. St Mary's Church in Addington, Christchurch also has a memorial bell tower to Richard Seddon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stmarysaddington.org/wordpress/history/|title=

The Duke of Argyll unveiled a memorial to Seddon in St.Paul's Cathedral, London, probably in 1910. It shows a portrait of Seddon with the inscription "

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7493">For women with '''[[systemic lupus erythematosus]]''' (SLE), '''[[pregnancy]]''' can present some particular challenges for both mother and child. 

While most infants born to mothers who have SLE are healthy, mothers with SLE as an [[intercurrent disease in pregnancy]] should remain under medical care until delivery. In general, women with SLE and, in addition, [[hypertension]], [[proteinuria]], and [[azotemia]] have an extra increased risk for pregnancy complications.&lt;ref name=medscape/&gt; Pregnancy outcomes in women with SLE who receive [[renal transplants]] are similar to those of transplant recipients without SLE.&lt;ref name=medscape/&gt;

Women pregnant and known to have [[Anti-Ro antibodies|anti-Ro]] (SSA) or [[anti-La antibodies]] (SSB) often have echocardiograms during the 16th and 30th weeks of pregnancy to monitor the health of the heart and surrounding vasculature.&lt;ref name=niams&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Lupus/default.asp |title=Handout on Health: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus |accessdate=2007-11-23 |date=August 2003 |work=The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases |publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contraception]] and other reliable forms of pregnancy prevention is routinely advised for women with SLE, since getting pregnant during active disease was found to be harmful. [[Lupus nephritis]] was the most common manifestation.

Of live births, approximately one third are delivered [[premature birth|prematurely]].&lt;ref name=medscape/&gt;

==Miscarriage==
SLE causes an increased rate of fetal death ''in utero'' and [[spontaneous abortion]] (miscarriage). The overall live-birth rate in SLE patient has been estimated to be 72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smyth|first=Andrew|author2=Guilherme H.M. Oliveira |author3=Brian D. Lahr |author4=Kent R.

Miscarriages in the [[first trimester]] appear either to have no known cause or to be associated with signs of active SLE.&lt;ref name=hopkins&gt;[http://www.hopkinslupus.org/lupus-info/lifestyle-additional-information/lupus-pregnancy/ Lupus and Pregnancy] by Michelle Petri. The Johns Hopkins Lupus Center. Retrieved May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Later losses appear to occur primarily due to the [[antiphospholipid syndrome]], in spite of treatment with [[heparin]] and [[aspirin]].&lt;ref name=hopkins/&gt; All women with lupus, even those without previous history of miscarriage, are recommended to be screened for [[antiphospholipid antibodies]], both the [[lupus anticoagulant]] (the RVVT and sensitive PTT are the best screening battery) and [[anticardiolipin antibodies]].&lt;ref name=hopkins/&gt;

==Neonatal lupus==
[[Neonatal lupus]] is the occurrence of SLE symptoms in an [[infant]] born from a mother with SLE, most commonly presenting with a rash resembling [[discoid lupus erythematosus]], and sometimes with systemic abnormalities such as [[heart block]] or [[hepatosplenomegaly]].&lt;ref name=Dorlands&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/neonatal+lupus thefreedictionary.com &gt; neonatal lupus] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers. Copyright 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Neonatal lupus is usually benign and self-limited.&lt;ref name=Dorlands/&gt; Still, identification of mothers at highest risk for complications allows for prompt treatment before or after birth. In addition, SLE can flare up during pregnancy, and proper treatment can maintain the health of the mother for longer.

==Aggravation of SLE==
Aggravation (or exacerbation) of SLE has been estimated to occur in about 20-30% pregnancies where the mother has SLE.&lt;ref name=medscape/&gt; Increased disease activity of SLE is expected during pregnancy because of increased levels of [[estrogen]], [[prolactin]], and certain [[cytokines]].&lt;ref name=medscape/&gt; However, a long time of remission before pregnancy decreases the risk of aggravation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Praticar Exercicios Durante Gravidez|url=https://barrigadesonho.com.br/blog/praticar-exercicios-durante-gravidez/|website=Barriga Sonho|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with an incidence of 7-33% in women who have been in remission for at least 6 months, and an incidence of 61-67% in women who have active SLE at the time of conception.&lt;ref name=medscape/&gt;

Renal disease flare-up is the most common presentation of SLE aggravation in pregnancy, and is seen equally in United States and European populations.&lt;ref name=medscape/&gt; [[Serositis]] with [[pleural effusion|pleural]] and [[pericardial effusion]]s are seen in up to 10% of these patients.&lt;ref name=medscape/&gt;

On the other hand, flares of SLE are uncommon during pregnancy and are often easily treated.&lt;ref name=medscape/&gt; The most common symptoms of these flares include [[arthritis]], [[rash]]es, and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].&lt;ref name=medscape&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/335055-overview Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Pregnancy] at Medscape. Author: Ritu Khurana. Chief Editor: David Chelmow. Updated: Sep 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in the [[postpartum period]], there  may be exacerbations of SLE due to decreased levels of anti-inflammatory steroids, elevated levels of [[prolactin]] and [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] changes.&lt;ref name=medscape/&gt;

In diagnosing an aggravation of SLE in pregnancy, there need to be a [[differential diagnosis]] from SLE-unrelated [[complications of pregnancy]] that may appear in a similar fashion. For example, [[chloasma]] may appear like the [[malar rash]] of SLE, [[proteinuria]] from [[preeclampsia]] may appear like that of [[lupus nephritis]], thrombocytopenia of the [[HELLP syndrome]] may appear like that of SLE, and pregnancy-related edema of joints can appear like arthritis of SLE.&lt;ref name=medscape/&gt;

==General preventive measures==
Continuing [[glucocorticoid]]s at the lowest effective dose and/or cautious use of [[azathioprine]] may be preferred in some patients, but needs to be weighed against potential adverse effects of such medications.&lt;ref name=medscape/&gt;

}}

== Education ==

Danino graduated from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] with Bachelor of Science degrees in [[physics]], [[mathematics]] and [[chemistry]]. He received a Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in [[bioengineering]] from the [[University of California, San Diego]], and completed [[Postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral training]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia University Biomedical Engineering: Tal Danino|url=http://bme.columbia.edu/tal-danino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Danino’s research focuses on the design and characterization of dynamic [[Synthetic biological circuit|gene circuits]] in [[microbes]] with applications such as cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, summarized in a 2015 [[TED talk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programming bacteria to detect cancer (and maybe treat it)|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/tal_danino_we_can_use_bacteria_to_detect_cancer_and_maybe_treat_it|website=TED.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his PhD thesis, he worked in Jeff Hasty's laboratory at UCSD, where he created synchronized oscillations in bacterial populations through [[synthetic biological circuits]] that combined [[Positive feedback|positive]] and [[negative feedback]] with a [[Reporter gene|fluorescent reporter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synthetic gene oscillators and their applications|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/36n4b0c4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting paper and corresponding video were published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A synchronized quorum of genetic clocks|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7279/full/nature08753.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a postdoctoral scientist at MIT, he worked in [[Sangeeta Bhatia]]'s laboratory at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, where he used [[probiotics]] to colonize [[tumors]] and detect their presence in urine via a color-changing molecule, resulting in a publication in [[Science Translational Medicine]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programmable probiotics for detection of cancer in urine|url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/289/289ra84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here he also characterized an engineered strain of [[Salmonella|S. typhimurium]] for the sustained release of cancer therapeutics, which was published in Nature in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synchronized cycles of bacterial lysis for in vivo delivery|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v536/n7614/full/nature18930.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He runs the Synthetic Biological Systems Laboratory at Columbia University, focuses on treating cancer with probiotic bacteria, in addition to dynamic gene circuit design of spatiotemporal behaviors.

== Artworks ==

Danino creates visual art involving bacteria and [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and encompassing various themes, often exploring the relationship of humans to microorganisms. His works have gained significant attention and have been featured in the [[New York Times]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gates Foundation Uses Art to Encourage Vaccination|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/arts/design/gates-foundation-uses-art-to-encourage-vaccination.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At M.I.T., Science Embraces a New Chaos Theory: Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/arts/design/at-mit-science-embraces-a-new-chaos-theory-art.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Atlantic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Devil Wears Pulsars|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-devil-wears-pulsars/384902/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wired magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Beautiful Wallpaper Made With Smallpox Vaccine|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/beautiful-wallpaper-made-smallpox-vaccine/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
He has collaborated with artists such as [[Vik Muniz]] in the ''Colonies'' series, where he developed a [[photolithography]] based printing process to create intricate patterns out of both bacterial and cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colonies: Vik Muniz And Tal Danino Turn Living Cells Into Art|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/colonies-turning-living-cells-into-art-video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turning cancer cells, bacteria into amazing art|url=https://www.cnet.com/pictures/transforming-cancer-cells-and-bacteria-into-works-of-art-pictures/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in collaboration with Vik Muniz and created by Bernardaud was the ''Petri'' collection, a set of porcelain dinner plates depicting [[pathogenic bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eating out of the petri dish: Vik Muniz and Tal Danino's bacterial tableware for Bernardaud|url=http://www.wallpaper.com/design/eating-out-of-the-petri-dish-vik-muniz-and-tal-daninos-bacterial-tableware-for-bernardaud}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VIK MUNIZ X TAL DANINO : Petri Set of Six Dinner Plates by Bernard|url=https://artmarkit.com/product/vik-muniz-x-tal-danino-petri-set-of-six-dinner-plates-by-bernardaud/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tal has worked with other artists such as [[Anicka Yi]], exploring concepts of biological identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sights (and Smells) of Anicka Yi's Bacteria Art Show|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_au/article/the-sights-and-smells-of-anicka-yis-bacteria-art-show}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anicka Yi's olfactory art|url=http://news.mit.edu/2015/anicka-yi-olfactory-art-0728}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Microuniverse'', he used artistic processes such as [[silk screening]] to display a variety of petri-dish grown bacterial colonies on different color backgrounds to show their wide range of growth morphologies, from rings to [[fractals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The most beautiful bacteria you'll ever see|url=http://ideas.ted.com/gallery-the-most-beautiful-bacteria-youll-ever-see/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Progressivism}}
{{Transhumanism}}
'''Techno-progressivism''' or '''tech-progressivism'''{{cn|date=March 2016}} is a stance of active support for the [[wikt:convergence|convergence]] of [[technological change]] and [[social change]]. Techno-progressives argue that technological developments can be profoundly [[empowerment|empowering]] and [[freedom (political)|emancipatory]] when they are regulated by legitimate [[democracy|democratic]] and [[accountable]] authorities to ensure that their [[social cost|cost]]s, [[risk]]s and [[cost-benefit analysis|benefits]] are all fairly shared by the actual [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] to those developments.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  The Trouble with "Transhumanism": Part Two|    date = 2004 |   url = http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/carrico20041222/| accessdate=2007-01-28|    authorlink = Dale Carrico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  Technoprogressivism Beyond Technophilia and Technophobia|    date = 2005 |   url = http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/carrico20060812/| accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stance==
Techno-progressivism maintains that accounts of [[Progress (history)|progress]] should focus on [[Scientific consensus|scientific]] and [[Technological change|technical]] dimensions, as well as [[ethics of technology|ethical]] and [[technology and society|social]] ones.  For most techno-progressive perspectives, then, the growth of scientific knowledge or the accumulation of technological powers will not represent the achievement of proper progress unless and until it is accompanied by a [[distributive justice|just distribution]] of the [[externality|costs, risks, and benefits]] of these new knowledges and capacities.  At the same time, for most techno-progressive [[social criticism|critic]]s and [[advocacy|advocates]], the achievement of [[participatory democracy|better democracy]], greater [[social justice|fairness]], less violence, and a wider [[civil libertarianism|rights culture]] are all desirable, but inadequate in themselves to confront the quandaries of contemporary technological societies unless and until they are accompanied by [[scientific progress|progress in science]] and technology to support and implement these values.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"/&gt;

Strong techno-progressive positions include support for the [[civil right]] of a [[person]] to either maintain or [[body modification|modify]] his or her own [[cognitive liberty|mind]] and [[morphological freedom|body]], on his or her own terms, through [[informed consent|informed, consensual]] recourse to, or refusal of, available therapeutic or enabling [[biomedical technology]].&lt;ref name="Carrico 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  The Politics of Morphological Freedom|    date = 2006 |   url = http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2006/08/politics-of-morphological-freedom.html| accessdate=2007-01-28|    authorlink = Dale Carrico}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2016}}

During the November 2014 [[Humanity+|Transvision Conference]], many of the leading [[transhumanist]] organizations signed the Technoprogressive Declaration. The Declaration stated the values of technoprogressivism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/tpdec2014 Technoprogressive Declaration - Transvision 2014, Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrasting stance==
{{Cleanup|reason=This section should move to [[Transhumanist politics]]|date=February 2018}}
{{Main article|Bioconservatism}}
[[Bioconservatism]] (a [[portmanteau]] word combining "[[biology]]" and "[[conservatism]]") is a stance of hesitancy about technological development especially if it is perceived to threaten a given [[social order]]. Strong bioconservative positions include opposition to [[Genetic engineering|genetic modification]] of [[transgenic plants|food crops]], the [[cloning]] and genetic engineering of [[livestock]] and [[pets]], and, most prominently, rejection of the genetic, prosthetic, and cognitive modification of human beings to overcome what are broadly perceived as current human biological and cultural limitations.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"/&gt;

Bioconservatives range in political perspective from [[right-wing politics|right-leaning]] religious and cultural [[conservatism|conservatives]] to [[left-wing politics|left-leaning]] [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] and [[appropriate technology|technology critics]]. What unifies bioconservatives is skepticism about [[medical]] and other [[biotechnology|biotechnological]] transformations of the [[biosphere|living world]].&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mander, Jerry (1991). ‘’In the Absence of the Sacred: The Failure of Technology and the Survival of the Indian Nations,’’, Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, California.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, Jeremy (1998). ‘’The Biotech Century: Harnessing the Gene and Remaking the World,’’ Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam, New York, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shiva, Vandana (2000). ‘’Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply,’’ South End Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically less sweeping as a critique of technological society than [[Neo-Luddism|bioluddism]], the bioconservative perspective is characterized by its defense of the [[natural]], deployed as a [[moral]] category.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"/&gt;

Although techno-progressivism is the stance which contrasts with bioconservatism in the [[biopolitical]] spectrum, both techno-progressivism and bioconservatism, in their more moderate expressions, share an opposition to unsafe, unfair, undemocratic forms of technological development, and both recognize that such developmental modes can facilitate unacceptable [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] and [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]], exacerbate injustice and incubate dangerous social discontent.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"/&gt;

{{Transhumanism}}

'''Transhumanism''' (abbreviated as '''H+''' or '''h+''') is an international [[school of thought|philosophical movement]] that advocates for the transformation of the [[human condition]] by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly [[human enhancement|enhance human]] intellect and physiology.&lt;ref name="Mercer"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Religion and Transhumanism: The Unknown Future of Human Enhancement|last = Mercer|first = Calvin|publisher = Praeger|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bostrom | first=Nick | authorlink = Nick Bostrom |title = A history of transhumanist thought|journal = [[Journal of Evolution and Technology]] |year = 2005 |url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/history.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate=February 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of [[emerging technologies]] that could overcome fundamental human limitations as well as the [[technoethics|ethical]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/fuller20150909|title=We May Look Crazy to Them, But They Look Like Zombies to Us: Transhumanism as a Political Challenge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; limitations of using such technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Techno-human Shell-A Jump in the Evolutionary Gap | publisher=Sunbury Press | author=Carvalko, Joseph | year=2012 | isbn=978-1620061657}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common transhumanist thesis is that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into different beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the current condition as to merit the label of [[posthuman#Transhumanism|posthuman]] beings.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt;

The contemporary meaning of the term "transhumanism" was foreshadowed by one of the first professors of [[Futures studies|futurology]], [[FM-2030]], who taught "new concepts of the human" at [[The New School]] in the 1960s, when he began to identify people who adopt technologies, lifestyles and [[worldview]]s "transitional" to posthumanity as                  "[[transhuman]]".&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; The assertion would lay the intellectual groundwork for the British philosopher [[Max More]] to begin articulating the principles of transhumanism as a [[futurist]] philosophy in 1990, and organizing in [[California]] an [[intelligentsia]] that has since grown into the worldwide transhumanist movement.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gelles 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=transhumanism&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Ctranshumanism%3B%2Cc0|title=Google Ngram Viewer |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by seminal works of [[science fiction]], the transhumanist vision of a transformed future humanity has attracted many supporters and detractors from a wide range of perspectives, including philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

==History==
===Precursors of transhumanism===
According to [[Nick Bostrom]], [[Self-transcendence|transcendentalist]] impulses have been expressed at least as far back as the quest for [[immortality]] in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], as well as in historical quests for the [[Fountain of Youth]], the [[Elixir of Life]], and other efforts to stave off aging and death.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt;

There is debate about whether the [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche]] can be considered an influence on transhumanism, despite its exaltation of the "[[Übermensch]]" (overman or superman), due to its emphasis on [[self-actualization]] rather than technological transformation.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorgner 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackford 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorgner 2012"/&gt; The transhumanist philosophies of [[Max More]] and [[Stefan Lorenz Sorgner]] have been influenced strongly by Nietzschean thinking.&lt;ref name="Sorgner 2009"/&gt; By way of contrast, The Transhumanist Declaration&lt;ref name="World Transhumanist Association 2002"/&gt; ''"...advocates the well-being of all sentience (whether in artificial intellects, humans, posthumans, or non-human animals)".

The late 19th to early 20th century movement known as [[Russian cosmism]] also incorporated some ideas which later developed into the core of the transhumanist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sovieteramuseum.com/?product=art-works-by-russian-cosmism-painter-xx-xxi-ct-catalogue-of-exhibition-2013|title=Art works by Russian cosmism painter XX – XXI ct.

===Early transhumanist thinking===
[[File:Hux-Oxon-72.jpg|thumb|150x200px|left|[[Julian Huxley]], the biologist who popularised the term ''transhumanism'' in an influential 1957 essay.]]
Fundamental ideas of transhumanism were first advanced in 1923 by the British geneticist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in his essay ''[[Daedalus; or, Science and the Future|Daedalus: Science and the Future]]'', which predicted that great benefits would come from the application of advanced sciences to human biology—and that every such advance would first appear to someone as blasphemy or perversion, "indecent and unnatural". In particular, he was interested in the development of the science of [[eugenics]], [[ectogenesis]] (creating and sustaining life in an artificial environment), and the application of genetics to improve human characteristics, such as health and intelligence.

His article inspired academic and popular interest. [[John Desmond Bernal|J. D. Bernal]], a crystallographer at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], wrote ''The World, the Flesh and the Devil'' in 1929, in which he speculated on the prospects of [[space colonization]] and radical changes to human bodies and intelligence through [[bionics|bionic implants]] and [[cognitive enhancement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Arthur C.|title=Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds|publisher=St Martin's Griffin, New York|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have been common transhumanist themes ever since.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005" /&gt;

The biologist [[Julian Huxley]] is generally regarded as the founder of transhumanism after using the term for the title of an influential 1957 article. The term itself, however, derives from an earlier 1940 paper by the Canadian philosopher W. D. Lighthall.&lt;ref name="Harrison and Wolyniak 2015"/&gt; Huxley describes transhumanism in these terms:
{{blockquote|Up till now human life has generally been, as Hobbes described it, 'nasty, brutish and short'; the great majority of human beings (if they have not already died young) have been afflicted with misery… we can justifiably hold the belief that these lands of possibility exist, and that the present limitations and miserable frustrations of our existence could be in large measure surmounted… The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself—not just sporadically, an individual here in one way, an individual there in another way, but in its entirety, as humanity.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1957"/&gt;}}

&lt;!-- [[File:2001 NAL.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', published in 1968, which deals with the transhumanist agenda.]]
 --&gt;Huxley's definition differs, albeit not substantially, from the one commonly in use since the 1980s. The ideas raised by these thinkers were explored in the [[science fiction]] of the 1960s, notably in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', in which an alien artifact grants transcendent power to its wielder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/163072-googles-glass-castle-the-rise-and-fear-of-a-transhuman-future/|title=Google's Glass Castle: The Rise and Fear of a Transhuman Future|author=Christopher Hutton|publisher=PopMatters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese [[Metabolist]] architects produced a manifesto in 1960 which outlined goals to "encourage active metabolic development of our society"&lt;ref&gt;Lin (2010), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; through design and technology. In the [[Metabolism (architecture)#Material and Man|Material and Man]] section of the manifesto, Noboru Kawazoe suggests that:&lt;blockquote&gt;After several decades, with the rapid progress of communication technology, every one will have a “brain wave receiver” in his ear, which conveys directly and exactly what other people think about him and vice versa. What I think will be known by all the people. There is no more individual consciousness, only the will of mankind as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kenzo Tange and the Metabolist Movement: Urban Utopias of Modern Japan|last = Lin|first = Zhongjie|publisher = Routledge|year = 2010|isbn = 9781135281984|location = |pages = 35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Artificial intelligence and the technological singularity===
The concept of the [[technological singularity]], or the ultra-rapid advent of superhuman intelligence, was first proposed by the British [[cryptologist]] [[I. J. Good]] in 1965:
{{blockquote|Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion,' and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.&lt;ref&gt;I.J. Good, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090420061605/http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Computing/Good-IJ/SCtFUM.html "Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine"] ([http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/pages/ultraintelligentmachine.html HTML] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128085512/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Good-Speculations-Concerning-the-First-Ultraintelligent-Machine.pdf |date=November 28, 2011 }}), ''Advances in Computers'', vol. 6, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Computer science|Computer scientist]] [[Marvin Minsky]] wrote on relationships between human and [[artificial intelligence]] beginning in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Minsky 1960"/&gt; Over the succeeding decades, this field continued to generate influential thinkers such as [[Hans Moravec]] and [[Raymond Kurzweil]], who oscillated between the technical arena and futuristic speculations in the transhumanist vein.&lt;ref name="Moravec 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 1999"/&gt; The coalescence of an identifiable transhumanist movement began in the last decades of the 20th century. In 1966, [[FM-2030]] (formerly F. M. Esfandiary), a [[futurist]] who taught "new concepts of the human" at [[The New School]], in [[New York City]], began to identify people who adopt technologies, lifestyles and world views transitional to [[posthumanity]] as "[[transhuman]]".&lt;ref name="FM-2030 1989"/&gt; In 1972, [[Robert Ettinger]] contributed to the conceptualization of "transhumanity" in his book ''Man into Superman.''&lt;ref name="Ettinger 1972" /&gt; FM-2030 published the ''Upwingers Manifesto'' in 1973.&lt;ref name="FM-2030 1973" /&gt;

===Growth of transhumanism===
The first self-described transhumanists met formally in the early 1980s at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], which became the main center of transhumanist thought. Here, [[FM-2030]] lectured on his "[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]" futurist ideology.&lt;ref name="FM-2030: Are You Transhuman" /&gt; At the [[EZTV (media company)|EZTV]] Media venue, frequented by transhumanists and other futurists, [[Natasha Vita-More]] presented ''Breaking Away'', her 1980 experimental film with the theme of humans breaking away from their biological limitations and the Earth's gravity as they head into space.&lt;ref name="EZTV Media"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition: Science Slightly Over the Edge"/&gt; FM-2030 and Vita-More soon began holding gatherings for transhumanists in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], which included students from FM-2030's courses and audiences from Vita-More's artistic productions. In 1982, Vita-More authored the ''Transhumanist Arts Statement''&lt;ref name="Vita-More 1982"/&gt; and, six years later, produced the cable TV show ''TransCentury Update ''on transhumanity, a program which reached over 100,000 viewers.

In 1986, [[K. Eric Drexler|Eric Drexler]] published ''[[Engines of Creation]]: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology,''&lt;ref name="Drexler 1986"/&gt; which discussed the prospects for [[nanotechnology]] and [[molecular assembler]]s, and founded the [[Foresight Institute]]. As the first non-profit organization to research, advocate for, and perform [[cryonics]], the Southern California offices of the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]] became a center for futurists. In 1988, the first issue of ''Extropy Magazine'' was published by [[Max More]] and Tom Morrow. In 1990, More, a strategic philosopher, created his own particular transhumanist doctrine, which took the form of the ''Principles of Extropy,'' and laid the foundation of modern transhumanism by giving it a new definition:&lt;ref name="More 1990"/&gt;

{{blockquote|Transhumanism is a class of philosophies that seek to guide us towards a posthuman condition. Transhumanism shares many elements of humanism, including a respect for reason and science, a commitment to progress, and a valuing of human (or transhuman) existence in this life. [...] Transhumanism differs from humanism in recognizing and anticipating the radical alterations in the nature and possibilities of our lives resulting from various sciences and technologies [...].}}

In 1992, More and Morrow founded the [[Extropy Institute]], a catalyst for networking futurists and brainstorming new [[memeplex]]es by organizing a series of conferences and, more importantly, providing a mailing list, which exposed many to transhumanist views for the first time during the rise of [[cyberculture]] and the [[cyberdelic]] counterculture. In 1998, philosophers [[Nick Bostrom]] and [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]] founded the [[World Transhumanist Association]] (WTA), an international non-governmental organization working toward the recognition of transhumanism as a legitimate subject of [[scientific inquiry]] and [[Policy|public policy]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2005"/&gt; In 2002, the WTA modified and adopted ''The Transhumanist Declaration.''&lt;ref name="World Transhumanist Association 2002"/&gt; ''The Transhumanist FAQ'', prepared by the WTA (later [[Humanity+]]), gave two formal definitions for transhumanism:&lt;ref name="What is Transhumanism"/&gt;
{{blockquote|
# The intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally improving the human condition through applied reason, especially by developing and making widely available technologies to eliminate aging and to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.
# The study of the ramifications, promises, and potential dangers of technologies that will enable us to overcome fundamental human limitations, and the related study of the ethical matters involved in developing and using such technologies.}}

In possible contrast with other transhumanist organizations, WTA officials considered that social forces could undermine their [[futurist]] visions and needed to be addressed.&lt;ref name = "Hughes 2004"/&gt; A particular concern is the equal access to [[human enhancement]] technologies across classes and borders.&lt;ref name="Utne"/&gt; In 2006, a [[transhumanist politics|political struggle]] within the transhumanist movement between the [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian right]] and the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal left]] resulted in a more [[centre-left]]ward positioning of the WTA under its former executive director [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]].&lt;ref name="Utne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Among the Transhumanists" /&gt; In 2006, the board of directors of the Extropy Institute ceased operations of the organization, stating that its mission was "essentially completed".&lt;ref name="Extropy Institute 2006" /&gt; This left the World Transhumanist Association as the leading international transhumanist organization. In 2008, as part of a rebranding effort, the WTA changed its name to "[[Humanity+]]".&lt;ref name="Newitz 2008" /&gt; In 2012, the transhumanist Longevity Party had been initiated as an international union of people who promote the development of scientific and technological means to significant life extension, that for now has more than 30 national organisations throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stambler |first=Ilia |title=The Longevity Party – Who Needs it?

The [[Mormon Transhumanist Association]] was founded in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About |url=http://transfigurism.org/pages/about/ |work=Mormon Transhumanist Association |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, it consisted of hundreds of members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Member Survey Results |url=http://transfigurism.org/pages/about/member-survey-results/ |work=Mormon Transhumanist Association |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first transhumanist elected member of a Parliament has been [[Giuseppe Vatinno]], in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/italy-elects-first-transhumanist-mp |title=Italy elects first transhumanist MP |publisher=Kurzweilai.net |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
{{See also|Outline of transhumanism}}
It is a matter of debate whether transhumanism is a branch of [[posthumanism]] and how this philosophical movement should be conceptualised with regard to transhumanism. The latter is often referred to as a variant or activist form of posthumanism by its [[Conservatism|conservative]],&lt;ref name="Fukuyama 2004"/&gt; [[Christianity|Christian]]&lt;ref name="Hook 2004"/&gt; and [[Progressivism|progressive]]&lt;ref name="The Hedgehog Review 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coenen 2007"/&gt; critics.

A common feature of transhumanism and philosophical posthumanism is the future vision of a new intelligent species, into which humanity will evolve and eventually will supplement or supersede it. Transhumanism stresses the evolutionary perspective, including sometimes the creation of a highly intelligent animal species by way of cognitive enhancement (i.e. [[biological uplift]]),&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004" /&gt; but clings to a "posthuman future" as the final goal of participant evolution.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2006"&gt;{{cite web | last = Bostrom | first = Nick | title = Why I Want to be a Posthuman When I Grow Up | url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/posthuman.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = December 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the idea of creating [[artificial intelligence|intelligent artificial beings]] (proposed, for example, by roboticist [[Hans Moravec]]) has influenced transhumanism.&lt;ref name="Moravec 1998" /&gt; Moravec's ideas and transhumanism have also been characterised as a "complacent" or "[[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]]" variant of posthumanism and contrasted with "[[cultural posthumanism]]" in [[humanities]] and [[the arts]].&lt;ref name="Cultural Critique 2003" /&gt; While such a "cultural posthumanism" would offer resources for rethinking the relationships between humans and increasingly sophisticated machines, transhumanism and similar posthumanisms are, in this view, not abandoning obsolete concepts of the "[[Agency (philosophy)|autonomous liberal subject]]", but are expanding its "[[prerogative]]s" into the realm of the [[posthuman]].&lt;ref name="Hayles 1999" /&gt; Transhumanist self-characterisations as a continuation of [[humanism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking correspond with this view.

Some [[Secular humanism|secular humanists]] conceive transhumanism as an offspring of the humanist [[freethought]] movement and argue that transhumanists differ from the humanist mainstream by having a specific focus on technological approaches to resolving human concerns (i.e. [[technocentrism]]) and on the issue of [[death|mortality]].&lt;ref name="Inniss 1998" /&gt; However, other progressives have argued that posthumanism, whether it be its philosophical or activist forms, amounts to a shift away from concerns about [[social justice]], from the [[social change|reform of human institutions]] and from other Enlightenment preoccupations, toward [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] longings for a [[Self-transcendence|transcendence]] of the human body in quest of more [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|exquisite]] ways of being.&lt;ref name="Winner 2005" /&gt;

As an alternative, humanist philosopher Dwight Gilbert Jones has proposed a renewed Renaissance humanism through DNA and genome repositories, with each individual genotype (DNA) being instantiated as successive phenotypes (bodies or lives via cloning, ''Church of Man'', 1978). In his view, native molecular DNA "continuity" is required for retaining the "self" and no amount of computing power or memory aggregation can replace the essential "stink" of our true genetic identity, which he terms "[http://genity.org/ genity]". Instead, DNA/genome stewardship by an institution analogous to the Jesuits' 400 year vigil is a suggested model for enabling humanism to become our species' common credo, a project he proposed in his speculative novel ''The Humanist – 1000 Summers'' (2011), wherein humanity dedicates these coming centuries to harmonizing our planet and peoples.

The philosophy of transhumanism is closely related to [[technoself studies]], an interdisciplinary domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of human identity in a technological society and focusing on the changing nature of relationships between humans and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Management Association, Information Resources|title=Public Affairs and Administration: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2S51CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2192|year=2015|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-8359-4|page=2192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aims ===
[[File:PPTCountdowntoSingularityLog.jpg|thumb|300px| Ray Kurzweil believes that a countdown to when "human life will be irreversibly transformed" can be made through plotting major world events on a graph.]]
While many transhumanist theorists and advocates seek to apply [[reason]], science and technology for the purposes of reducing poverty, disease, disability and malnutrition around the globe,&lt;ref name="What is Transhumanism" /&gt; transhumanism is distinctive in its particular focus on the applications of technologies to the improvement of human bodies at the individual level. Many transhumanists actively assess the potential for future technologies and innovative social systems to improve the quality of [[biocentrism (ethics)|all life]], while seeking to make the material reality of the human condition fulfill the promise of legal and political equality by eliminating [[Congenital disorder|congenital mental and physical barriers]].

Transhumanist philosophers argue that there not only exists a [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionist ethical imperative]] for humans to strive for progress and improvement of the human condition, but that it is possible and desirable for humanity to enter a [[transhuman]] phase of existence in which humans [[human enhancement|enhance themselves]] beyond what is naturally human. In such a phase, natural evolution would be replaced with deliberate participatory or [[directed evolution]].

Some theorists such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] think that the [[Accelerating change|pace of technological innovation is accelerating]] and that the next 50 years may yield not only radical technological advances, but possibly a [[technological singularity]], which may fundamentally change the nature of human beings.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"/&gt; Transhumanists who foresee this massive technological change generally maintain that it is desirable. However, some are also concerned with the possible dangers of extremely rapid technological change and propose options for ensuring that advanced technology is used responsibly. For example, Bostrom has written extensively on [[existential risk]]s to humanity's future welfare, including ones that could be created by emerging technologies.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"/&gt;

While many people believe that all transhumanists are striving for immortality, it is not necessarily true. Hank Pellissier, managing director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (2011–2012), surveyed transhumanists. He found that, of the 818 respondents, 23.8% did not want immortality.&lt;ref name="Pellissier, Hank 2012"&gt;Pellissier, Hank. "Do all Transhumanists Want Immortality? No? Why Not?" Futurist 46.6 (2012): 65-. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons argued were boredom, Earth's overpopulation and the desire "to go to an afterlife".&lt;ref name="Pellissier, Hank 2012"/&gt;

=== Empathic fallibility and conversational consent ===
{{See also|Uplift (science fiction)}}
Certain transhumanist philosophers hold that since all assumptions about what others experience [[fallibility|are fallible]], and that therefore all attempts to help or protect beings that are not capable of correcting what others assume about them no matter how well-intentioned are in danger of actually hurting them, all [[sentience|sentient]] beings deserve to be [[sapience|sapient]]. These thinkers argue that the ability to discuss in a [[falsifiability|falsification-based]] way constitutes a [[critical phenomena|threshold that is not arbitrary]] at which it becomes possible for an individual to speak for themself in a way that is not dependent on exterior assumptions. They also argue that all beings capable of experiencing something deserve to be elevated to this threshold if they are not at it, typically stating that the underlying change that leads to the threshold is an increase in the preciseness of the [[brain]]'s ability to discriminate. This includes increasing the neuron count and connectivity in animals as well as accelerating the development of connectivity in order to shorten or ideally skip non-sapient childhood incapable of independently deciding for oneself. Transhumanists of this description stress that the genetic engineering that they advocate is general insertion into both the somatic cells of living beings and in germ cells, and not purging of individuals without the modifications, deeming the latter not only unethical but also unnecessary due to the possibilities of efficient genetic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Human Purpose and Transhuman Potential: A Cosmic Vision of Our Future Evolution, Ted Chu 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The thinker's guide to ethical reasoning, Linda Elder and Richard Paul 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How to Think about Weird Things: Critical Thinking for a New Age Theodore Schick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ten Billion Tomorrows: How Science Fiction Technology Became Reality and Shapes the Future, Brian Clegg 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethics ===
{{Humanism}}
Transhumanists engage in [[interdisciplinary]] approaches to understand and evaluate possibilities for overcoming biological limitations by drawing on [[futurology]] and various fields of ethics.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Unlike many philosophers, social critics and activists who place a moral value on preservation of [[nature|natural]] systems, transhumanists see the very concept of the specifically [[Appeal to nature|natural]] as problematically nebulous at best and an obstacle to progress at worst.&lt;ref name="Bostrom, Sandberg 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Nick Bostrom|Bostrom, Nick]] &amp; [[Anders Sandberg|Sandberg, Anders]]| title = The Wisdom of Nature: An Evolutionary Heuristic for Human Enhancement| year = 2007| url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/evolution.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this, many prominent transhumanist advocates, such as Dan Agin, refer to transhumanism's critics, on the political right and left jointly, as "[[Bioconservatism|bioconservatives]]" or "[[neo-luddism|bioluddites]]", the latter term alluding to the 19th century [[luddite|anti-industrialisation]] social movement that opposed the replacement of human manual labourers by machines.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002"/&gt;

A belief of counter-transhumanism is that transhumanism can cause unfair human enhancement in many areas of life, but specifically on the social plane. This can be compared to steroid use, where athletes who use steroids in sports have an advantage over those who do not. The same scenario happens when people have certain neural implants that give them an advantage in the work place and in educational aspects.&lt;ref name="Tennison 2012"/&gt;

=== Currents ===
There is a variety of opinions within transhumanist thought. Many of the leading transhumanist thinkers hold views that are under constant revision and development.&lt;ref name="WTA FAQ 5.2"/&gt; Some distinctive currents of transhumanism are identified and listed here in alphabetical order:
* [[Democratic transhumanism]], a political ideology synthesizing [[liberal democracy]], [[social democracy]], [[radical democracy]] and transhumanism.&lt;ref name="Hughes A2002"/&gt;
*[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326693925_Extrapolitical_Theory_and_Postpoliticism Postpoliticism],  a transhumanist political proposal that aims to create a Postdemocratic state based on reason and free access of enhancement technologies to people. It tries to overcome the four traditional political theories (liberalism, socialism, nationalism, conservatism) while adding the best, if had, of them&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327756347_Extrapolitical_Theory_and_Postpoliticism_-_A_Transhumanist_Political_Theory|title=Extrapolitical Theory and Postpoliticism - A Transhumanist Political Theory|last=Gayozzo|first=Piero|date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Extropianism]], an early school of transhumanist thought characterized by a set of principles advocating a [[Proactionary principle|proactive approach]] to human evolution.&lt;ref name="More 1990"/&gt;
* [[Immortalism]], a moral ideology based upon the belief that radical [[life extension]] and [[Immortality#Technological immortality|technological immortality]] is possible and desirable, and advocating research and development to ensure its realization.&lt;ref name="imminst"/&gt;
* [[Libertarian transhumanism]], a political ideology synthesizing [[libertarianism]] and transhumanism.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002"/&gt;
* [[Postgenderism]], a social philosophy which seeks the voluntary elimination of [[gender]] in the human species through the application of advanced biotechnology and [[reproductive technology|assisted reproductive technologies]].&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008" /&gt;

=== Spirituality ===
Although many transhumanists are [[atheism|atheists]], [[agnosticism|agnostics]], and/or [[secular humanism|secular humanists]], some have [[religion|religious]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] views.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2005"/&gt; Despite the prevailing secular attitude, some transhumanists pursue hopes traditionally espoused by religions, such as [[immortality]],&lt;ref name =imminst/&gt; while several controversial [[new religious movement]]s from the late 20th century have explicitly embraced transhumanist goals of transforming the human condition by applying technology to the alteration of the mind and body, such as [[Raëlism]].&lt;ref name="Rael 2002"/&gt; However, most thinkers associated with the transhumanist movement focus on the practical goals of using technology to help achieve longer and healthier lives, while speculating that future understanding of [[neurotheology]] and the application of [[neurotechnology]] will enable humans to gain greater control of [[altered states of consciousness]], which were commonly interpreted as [[spiritual experience]]s, and thus achieve more profound [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]].&lt;ref name="Hughes BH 2004"/&gt; Transhumanist Buddhists have sought to explore areas of agreement between various types of Buddhism and Buddhist-derived meditation and mind expanding "neurotechnologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/cyborgbuddha|title=IEET Cyborg Buddha Project|work=ieet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have been criticised for appropriating mindfulness as a tool for transcending humanness.&lt;ref name="Evans 2014"/&gt;

Some transhumanists believe in the compatibility between the human mind and computer hardware, with the theoretical implication that human [[consciousness]] may someday be transferred to alternative media (a speculative technique commonly known as [[mind uploading]]).&lt;ref name="Sandberg 2000"/&gt; One extreme formulation of this idea, which some transhumanists are interested in, is the proposal of the [[Omega Point]] by Christian cosmologist [[Frank J. Tipler|Frank Tipler]]. Drawing upon ideas in [[Digital philosophy|digitalism]], Tipler has advanced the notion that the collapse of the [[Universe]] billions of years hence could create the conditions for the perpetuation of humanity in a [[simulated reality]] within a megacomputer and thus achieve a form of "[[posthuman God|posthuman godhood]]". Tipler's thought was inspired by the writings of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a [[paleontologist]] and [[Jesuit]] theologian who saw an evolutionary [[telos (philosophy)|telos]] in the development of an encompassing [[noosphere]], a global consciousness.&lt;ref name="tipler1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://jetpress.org/v20/steinhart.htm?pagewanted=all |title=Teilhard de Chardin and Transhumanism |author=Eric Steinhart |journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology |volume=20 |issue=1 |date=December 2008 |pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Transhumanism and Transcendence |author=Michael S. Burdett |page=20 |quote=...others have made important contributions as well. For example, Freeman Dyson and Frank Tipler in the twentieth century... |publisher=[[Georgetown University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-58901-780-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewed from the perspective of some [[Christian]] thinkers, the idea of mind uploading is asserted to represent a [[Transhumanism#Contempt for the flesh|denigration of the human body]], characteristic of [[gnostic]] manichaean belief.&lt;ref name="Pauls 2005"/&gt; Transhumanism and its presumed intellectual progenitors have also been described as [[Gnosticism in modern times|neo-gnostic]] by non-Christian and secular commentators.&lt;ref name="Giesen 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis 1999"/&gt;

The first dialogue between transhumanism and [[faith]] was a one-day conference held at the [[University of Toronto]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Walker 2005"/&gt; Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of transhumanism as offering no eternal truths nor a relationship with the [[divinity|divine]]. They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of [[postmodern]] [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] and [[anomie]]. Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of the transhumanist philosophy, which, far from being cynical, is rooted in [[optimistic]], idealistic attitudes that trace back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="TransVision 2004: Faith, Transhumanism and Hope Symposium"/&gt; Following this dialogue, [[William Sims Bainbridge]], a [[sociology of religion|sociologist of religion]], conducted a pilot study, published in the [[Journal of Evolution and Technology]], suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that individuals with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as being a direct, competitive (though ultimately futile) affront to their spiritual beliefs.&lt;ref name="Bainbridge"/&gt;

Since 2006, the [[Mormon Transhumanist Association]] sponsors conferences and lectures on the intersection of technology and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mormon Transhumanist Association |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/transfigurism |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, the [[American Academy of Religion]] holds a "Transhumanism and Religion" consultation during its annual meeting, where scholars in the field of [[religious studies]] seek to identify and critically evaluate any implicit religious beliefs that might underlie key transhumanist claims and assumptions; consider how transhumanism challenges religious traditions to develop their own ideas of the human future, in particular the prospect of human transformation, whether by technological or other means; and provide critical and constructive assessments of an envisioned future that place greater confidence in nanotechnology, robotics and information technology to achieve virtual immortality and create a superior posthuman species.&lt;ref name="AAR: Transhumanism and Religion Consultations"/&gt;

The physicist and transhumanist thinker [[Giulio Prisco]] states that "cosmist religions based on science, might be our best protection from reckless pursuit of superintelligence and other risky technologies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Turing Church | title=Religion as Protection From Reckless Pursuit of Superintelligence and Other Risky Technologies | date=September 9, 2014 | url=http://turingchurch.com/2014/09/09/religion-as-protection-from-reckless-pursuit-of-superintelligence-and-other-risky-technologies/ | author=Giulio Prisco | access-date=May 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisco also recognizes the importance of spiritual ideas, such as the ones of [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov]], to the origins of the transhumanism movement.

== Practice ==
While some transhumanists{{who|date=October 2014}} take an abstract and theoretical approach to the perceived benefits of emerging technologies, others have offered specific proposals for modifications to the human body, including heritable ones. Transhumanists are often concerned with methods of enhancing the human [[nervous system]]. Though some, such as [[Kevin Warwick]], propose modification of the [[peripheral nervous system]], the [[human brain|brain]] is considered the common denominator of personhood and is thus a primary focus of transhumanist ambitions.&lt;ref name="Walker 2002"/&gt;

In fact, Warwick has gone a lot further than merely making a proposal. In 2002 he had a 100 electrode array surgically implanted into the median nerves of his left arm in order to link his nervous system directly with a computer and thus to also connect with the internet. As a consequence, he carried out a series of experiments. He was able to directly control a robot hand using his neural signals and to feel the force applied by the hand through feedback from the fingertips. He also experienced a form of ultrasonic sensory input and conducted the first purely electronic communication between his own nervous system and that of his wife who also had electrodes implanted.&lt;ref name="doi10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369|noedit"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369| pmid = 14568806| title = The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems| journal = Archives of Neurology| volume = 60| issue = 10| pages = 1369–73| year = 2003| last1 = Warwick | first1 = K. | last2 = Gasson | first2 = M. | last3 = Hutt | first3 = B. | last4 = Goodhew | first4 = I. | last5 = Kyberd | first5 = P. | last6 = Andrews | first6 = B. | last7 = Teddy | first7 = P. | last8 = Shad | first8 = A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As proponents of [[self-improvement]] and [[body modification]], including [[transitioning (transgender)|gender transitioning]], transhumanists tend to use existing technologies and techniques that supposedly improve cognitive and physical performance, while engaging in routines and lifestyles designed to improve health and longevity.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 1993"/&gt; Depending on their age, some{{who|date=October 2014}} transhumanists express concern that they will not live to reap the benefits of future technologies. However, many have a great interest in [[life extension]] strategies and in funding research in [[cryonics]] in order to make the latter a viable option of last resort, rather than remaining an unproven method.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2004"/&gt; Regional and global transhumanist networks and communities with a range of objectives exist to provide support and forums for discussion and collaborative projects.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Technologies of interest ===
{{Main|Human enhancement technologies}}
[[File:Converging technologies.png|thumb|''Converging Technologies'', a 2002 report exploring the potential for synergy among nano-, bio-, info- and cogno-technologies, has become a landmark in near-future technological speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtec.org/ConvergingTechnologies/Report/welcome.htm |title=''Converging Technologies'' |publisher=Wtec.org |date= |accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Transhumanists support the [[emerging technologies|emergence]] and [[converging technologies|convergence]] of technologies including [[nanotechnology]], [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]] and [[cognitive science]] (NBIC), as well as hypothetical future technologies like [[simulated reality]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[superintelligence]], [[3D bioprinting]], [[mind uploading]], chemical brain preservation and [[cryonics]]. They believe that humans can and should use these technologies to become [[superhuman|more than human]].&lt;ref name="Naam 2005"/&gt; Therefore, they support the recognition and/or protection of [[cognitive liberty]], [[morphological freedom]] and [[procreative liberty]] as [[civil liberties]], so as to guarantee individuals the choice of using [[human enhancement technologies]] on themselves and their children.&lt;ref name="Sandberg 2001"/&gt; Some speculate that human enhancement techniques and other emerging technologies may facilitate more radical human enhancement no later than at the midpoint of the 21st century. Kurzweil's book ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'' and Michio Kaku's book ''[[Physics of the Future]]'' outline various human enhancement technologies and give insight on how these technologies may impact the human race.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaku|first=Michio|title=Physics of the Future|year=2011|publisher=Doubleday|location=United States|pages=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reports on the converging technologies and NBIC concepts have criticised their transhumanist orientation and alleged [[science fiction]]al character.&lt;ref name="The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004"/&gt; At the same time, research on brain and body alteration technologies has been accelerated under the sponsorship of the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], which is interested in the battlefield advantages they would provide to the [[supersoldier]]s of the United States and its allies.&lt;ref name="Moreno 2006"/&gt; There has already been a brain research program to "extend the ability to manage information", while military scientists are now looking at stretching the human capacity for combat to a maximum 168 hours without sleep.&lt;ref name="Managing Nano-Bio-Info-Cogno Innovations: Converging Technologies in Society"/&gt;

Neuroscientist [[Anders Sandberg]] has been practicing on the method of scanning ultra-thin sections of the brain. This method is being used to help better understand the architecture of the brain. As of now, this method is currently being used on mice. This is the first step towards uploading contents of the human brain, including memories and emotions, onto a computer.&lt;ref name="Sandberg 2009"/&gt;

== Arts and culture ==
{{Main|Transhumanism in fiction}}
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
Transhumanist themes have become increasingly prominent in various literary forms during the period in which the movement itself has emerged. Contemporary [[science fiction]] often contains positive renditions of technologically enhanced human life set in [[utopia]]n (especially [[techno-utopia]]n) societies. However, science fiction's depictions of enhanced humans or other posthuman beings frequently come with a cautionary twist. The more pessimistic scenarios include many [[horror fiction|horrific]] or [[dystopia]]n tales of human [[bioengineering]] gone wrong. In the decades immediately before transhumanism emerged as an explicit movement, many transhumanist concepts and themes began appearing in the speculative fiction of authors of the [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]] such as [[Robert A. Heinlein]] ([[Lazarus Long]] series, 1941–87), [[A. E. van Vogt]] (''[[Slan]]'', 1946), [[Isaac Asimov]] (''[[I, Robot]]'', 1950), [[Arthur C. Clarke]] (''[[Childhood's End]]'', 1953) and [[Stanisław Lem]] (''[[Cyberiad]]'', 1967).&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' (1945) contains an early critique of transhumanism.

In a series of science fiction novels by [[Neal Asher]], the protagonist is an augmented human who carries out missions for "Earth Central Security", an [[artificial intelligence]] and [[superhuman]] coalition. The author portrays a variety of augmentations in addition to the copying of memory and human minds into crystals and the presence of both benevolent and malevolent artificial intelligences.

The [[cyberpunk]] genre, exemplified by [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984) and [[Bruce Sterling]]'s ''[[Schismatrix]]'' (1985), has particularly been concerned with the modification of human bodies. Other novels dealing with transhumanist themes that have stimulated broad discussion of these issues include ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'' (1985), by [[Greg Bear]]; ''[[Lilith's Brood|The Xenogenesis Trilogy]]'' (1987–1989), by [[Octavia Butler]]; ''[[Beggars in Spain|The Beggar's Trilogy]]'' (1990–94), by [[Nancy Kress]]; much of [[Greg Egan]]'s work since the early 1990s such as ''[[Permutation City]]'' (1994) and ''[[Diaspora (novel)|Diaspora]]'' (1997); The [[Culture series]] of Iain M. Banks; ''The Bohr Maker'' (1995), by [[Linda Nagata]]; ''[[Altered Carbon]]'' (2002), by Richard K. Morgan; ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' (2003), by [[Margaret Atwood]]; ''[[The Elementary Particles]]'' (Eng. trans. 2001) and ''[[The Possibility of an Island]]'' (Eng. trans. 2006), by [[Michel Houellebecq]]; ''Mindscan'' (2005), by [[Robert J. Sawyer]]; the ''[[Commonwealth Saga]]'' (2002–10), by [[Peter F. Hamilton]]; and ''[[Glasshouse (novel)|Glasshouse]]'' (2005), by [[Charles Stross]]. Some of these works are considered part of the cyberpunk genre or its [[postcyberpunk]] offshoot.

[[Dan Brown]]'s novel ''[[Inferno (Dan Brown novel)|Inferno]]'' focuses on the theme of transhumanism. In an interview with ''Today'', Dan Brown said "Transhumanism is the ethics and science of using things like biological and genetic engineering to transform our bodies and make us a more powerful species".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/dan-brown-inferno-i-just-spent-3-years-hell-1C9909476|title=Dan Brown on 'Inferno': 'I just spent 3 years in hell'|work=Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictional transhumanist scenarios have also become popular in other media during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Such treatments are found in [[comic book]]s (''[[Captain America]]'', 1941; ''[[Iron Man]]'' 1963; ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'', 1997; ''[[The Surrogates]]'', 2006), [[film]]s (''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', 1968; ''[[Blade Runner]]'', 1982; ''[[Gattaca]]'', 1997, ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'', 2015), [[television series]] (the [[Cybermen]] of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', 1966; the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', 1989, ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', 2003, ''[[Black Mirror]]'', 2011), [[manga]] and [[anime]] (''[[Galaxy Express 999]]'', 1978; ''[[Appleseed (manga)|Appleseed]]'', 1985; ''[[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', 1989; ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', 1995; and the ''[[Gundam]]'' metaseries, 1979), [[video game]]s (''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', 1998; ''[[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]]'', 1999; ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'', 2000; ''[[EVE Online]]'', 2003; ''[[BioShock]]'', 2007; ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', 2004; ''[[Crysis]]'', 2007; ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]''; 2011;&lt;ref name="montrealmirror"/&gt; ''[[Deus Ex: Mankind Divided]]'', 2016) and [[role-playing game]]s.

Carnal Art, a form of [[sculpture]] originated by French artist [[Orlan]], uses the body as its medium and [[plastic surgery]] as its method.&lt;ref name="O'Bryan 2005"&gt;{{cite book| author = O'Bryan, C. Jill| title = Carnal Art:Orlan's Refacing| publisher = [[University of Minnesota Press]]| year = 2005| isbn = 0-8166-4322-9| oclc = 56755659}}&lt;/ref&gt; French biological anthropologist Dr. Judith Nicogossian also works on representations of the hybrid body.

== Debate{{anchor|Controversy}} ==
The very notion and prospect of human enhancement and related issues arouse public controversy.&lt;ref name="Garreau 2006"/&gt; Criticisms of transhumanism and its proposals take two main forms: those objecting to the likelihood of transhumanist goals being achieved (practical criticisms) and those objecting to the moral principles or worldview sustaining transhumanist proposals or underlying transhumanism itself (ethical criticisms). Critics and opponents often see transhumanists' goals as posing threats to [[humanism|human values]].

Some of the most widely known critiques of the transhumanist program are novels and fictional films. These works of art, despite presenting imagined worlds rather than philosophical analyses, are used as touchstones for some of the more formal arguments.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; Various arguments have been made to the effect that a society that adopts human enhancement technologies may come to resemble the [[dystopia]] depicted in the 1932 novel ''[[Brave New World]], ''by [[Aldous Huxley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UVRim2WvW50C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Various+arguments+have+been+made+to+the+effect+that+a+society+that+adopts+human+enhancement+technologies+may+come+to+resemble+the+dystopia+depicted+in+the+1932+novel+Brave+New+World,+by+Aldous+Huxley&amp;ots=g4onz4Zzf7&amp;sig=mgG6-iJrLCD-5YnRaI_Dc2JsKj0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution|last=Fukuyama|first=Francis|date=2003-05-01|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=9780374706180|location=|pages=7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On another front, some authors consider that humanity would already be transhuman, because medical advances in recent centuries have significantly altered our species. However, it would not be in a conscious and therefore transhumanistic way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casas|first1=Miquel|title=El fin del Homo sapiens: La naturaleza y el transhumanismo|date=2017|page= 112| publisher=2017|location=Madrid|isbn=9788416996353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feasibility ===
In a 1992 book, sociologist Max Dublin pointed to many past failed predictions of technological progress and argued that modern futurist predictions would prove similarly inaccurate. He also objected to what he saw as [[scientism]], fanaticism and [[nihilism]] by a few in advancing transhumanist causes. Dublin also said that historical parallels existed between [[Millenarianism|Millenarian]] religions and [[Historical materialism|Communist doctrines]].&lt;ref name="Dublin 1992"/&gt;

Although generally sympathetic to transhumanism, public health professor [[Gregory Stock]] is skeptical of the technical feasibility and mass appeal of the [[cyborgization]] of humanity predicted by Raymond Kurzweil, [[Hans Moravec]] and [[Kevin Warwick]]. He said that, throughout the 21st century, many humans would find themselves deeply integrated into systems of machines, but would remain biological. Primary changes to their own form and character would arise not from [[cyberware]], but from the direct manipulation of their [[genetics]], [[metabolism]] and [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref name="Stock 2002"/&gt;

In her 1992 book ''Science as Salvation'', philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] traces the notion of achieving immortality by [[Self-transcendence|transcendence]] of the material human body (echoed in the transhumanist tenet of [[mind uploading]]) to a group of male scientific thinkers of the early 20th century, including [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and members of his circle. She characterizes these ideas as "quasi-scientific dreams and prophesies" involving [[Escapism|visions of escape]] from the body coupled with "self-indulgent, uncontrolled power-fantasies". Her argument focuses on what she perceives as the [[pseudoscientific]] speculations and irrational, fear-of-death-driven fantasies of these thinkers, their disregard for [[layman|laymen]] and the remoteness of their [[eschatological]] visions.&lt;ref name="Midgley 1992"/&gt;

Another critique is aimed mainly at "[[algeny]]" (a portmanteau of ''alchemy'' and ''genetics''), which [[Jeremy Rifkin]] defined as "the upgrading of existing organisms and the design of wholly new ones with the intent of 'perfecting' their performance".&lt;ref name="Rifkin 1983"/&gt; It emphasizes the issue of [[biocomplexity]] and the unpredictability of attempts to guide the development of products of biological [[evolution]]. This argument, elaborated in particular by the biologist [[Stuart Newman]], is based on the recognition that [[somatic cell nuclear transfer|cloning]] and [[germline]] [[genetic engineering]] of animals are error-prone and inherently disruptive of embryonic [[morphogenesis|development]]. Accordingly, so it is argued, it would create unacceptable risks to use such methods on human embryos. Performing experiments, particularly ones with permanent biological consequences, on developing humans would thus be in violation of accepted principles governing research on human subjects (see the 1964 [[Declaration of Helsinki]]). Moreover, because improvements in experimental outcomes in one species are not automatically transferable to a new species without further experimentation, it is claimed that there is no ethical route to genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages.&lt;ref name="Newman 2003"/&gt;

As a practical matter, however, international protocols on human subject research may not present a legal obstacle to attempts by transhumanists and others to improve their offspring by germinal choice technology. According to legal scholar Kirsten Rabe Smolensky, existing laws would protect parents who choose to enhance their child's genome from future liability arising from adverse outcomes of the procedure.&lt;ref name="Smolensky 2006"/&gt;

Transhumanists and other supporters of human genetic engineering do not dismiss practical concerns out of hand, insofar as there is a high degree of uncertainty about the timelines and likely outcomes of genetic modification experiments in humans. However, [[bioethicist]] [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] suggests that one possible ethical route to the genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages is the building of [[computer model]]s of the [[human genome]], the proteins it specifies and the [[tissue engineering]] he argues that it also codes for. With the exponential progress in [[bioinformatics]], Hughes believes that a virtual model of genetic expression in the human body will not be far behind and that it will soon be possible to accelerate approval of genetic modifications by simulating their effects on virtual humans.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; [[Public health]] professor [[Gregory Stock]] points to [[Human artificial chromosome|artificial chromosomes]] as an alleged safer alternative to existing genetic engineering techniques.&lt;ref name = "Stock 2002"/&gt;

Thinkers{{who|date=October 2014}} who defend the likelihood of [[accelerating change]] point to a past pattern of exponential increases in humanity's technological capacities. Kurzweil developed this position in his 2005 book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]''.

=== Intrinsic immorality ===
It has been argued that, in transhumanist thought, humans attempt to substitute themselves for [[God]]. The 2002 [[Holy See|Vatican]] statement ''Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God,''&lt;ref name="International Theological Commission 2002"/&gt; stated that "changing the genetic identity of man as a human person through the production of an [[infrahuman]] being is radically immoral", implying, that "man has full right of disposal over his own biological nature". The statement also argues that creation of a superhuman or spiritually superior being is "unthinkable", since true improvement can come only through religious experience and "[[Divinization (Christian)|realizing more fully the image of God]]". Christian theologians and lay activists of several churches and denominations have expressed similar objections to transhumanism and claimed that Christians attain in the afterlife what radical transhumanism promises, such as indefinite [[life extension]] or the abolition of suffering. In this view, transhumanism is just another representative of the long line of [[utopian]] movements which seek to [[immanentize the eschaton|create "heaven on earth"]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell &amp; Kilner 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barratt 2006"/&gt; On the other hand, religious thinkers allied with transhumanist goals such as the theologians Ronald Cole-Turner and [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] hold that the doctrine of "co-creation" provides an obligation to use genetic engineering to improve human biology.&lt;ref name="Cole-Turner 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters 1997"/&gt;

Other critics target what they claim to be an instrumental conception of the human body in the writings of Marvin Minsky, [[Hans Moravec]] and some other transhumanists.&lt;ref name="Hayles 1999"/&gt; Reflecting a strain of [[feminism|feminist]] criticism of the transhumanist program, philosopher [[Susan Bordo]] points to "contemporary [[Body image|obsessions with slenderness, youth and physical perfection]]", which she sees as affecting both men and women, but in distinct ways, as "the logical (if extreme) manifestations of anxieties and fantasies fostered by our culture."&lt;ref name="Bordo 1993"/&gt; Some critics question other social implications of the movement's focus on [[body modification]]. Political scientist Klaus-Gerd Giesen, in particular, has asserted that transhumanism's concentration on altering the human body represents the logical yet tragic consequence of [[atomized individualism]] and body [[commodification]] within a [[consumer culture]].&lt;ref name="Giesen 2004"/&gt;

Nick Bostrom responds that the desire to [[rejuvenation (aging)|regain youth]], specifically, and transcend the natural limitations of the human body, in general, is pan-cultural and pan-historical, and is therefore not uniquely tied to the culture of the 20th century. He argues that the transhumanist program is an attempt to channel that desire into a scientific project on par with the [[Human Genome Project]] and achieve humanity's oldest hope, rather than a puerile fantasy or social trend.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt;

=== Loss of human identity ===
[[File:Amish vs modern transportation.jpg|thumb|In the U.S., the [[Amish]] are a religious group probably most known for their avoidance of certain modern technologies. Transhumanists draw a parallel by arguing that in the near-future there will probably be "humanish", people who choose to "stay human" by not adopting human enhancement technologies. They believe their choice must be respected and protected.&lt;ref name="Alexander 2000"/&gt;]]

In his 2003 book ''Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age'', [[environmental ethics|environmental ethicist]] [[Bill McKibben]] argued at length against many of the technologies that are postulated or supported by transhumanists, including [[germinal choice technology]], [[nanomedicine]] and [[life extension]] strategies. He claims that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to [[aging]], [[maximum life span]] and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to "improve" themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem [[Meaning of life|meaningful]] in a world where such limitations could be overcome technologically. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using as examples [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]] and the contemporary [[Amish]].&lt;ref name="McKibben 2003"/&gt;

[[Biopolitical]] activist [[Jeremy Rifkin]] and biologist [[Stuart Newman]] accept that biotechnology has the power to make profound changes in [[organism]]al identity. They argue against the genetic engineering of human beings because they fear the blurring of the boundary between human and [[Cultural artifact|artifact]].&lt;ref name="Newman 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Otchet 1998"/&gt; Philosopher Keekok Lee sees such developments as part of an accelerating trend in [[modernization]] in which technology has been used to transform the "natural" into the "artefactual".&lt;ref name="Lee 1999"/&gt; In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of "[[monster]]s" such as [[human clone]]s, [[human-animal hybrid|human-animal]] [[chimera (genetics)|chimeras]], or [[bioroid]]s, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from [[social structure|social]] and [[ecosystem|ecological]] systems are seen as problematic. The film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) and the novels ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys From Brazil]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'' (1896) depict elements of such scenarios, but Mary Shelley's 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' is most often alluded to by critics who suggest that biotechnologies could create [[objectification|objectified]] and [[anomie|socially unmoored]] people as well as [[untermensch|subhumans]]. Such critics propose that strict measures be implemented to prevent what they portray as [[dehumanization|dehumanizing]] possibilities from ever happening, usually in the form of an international [[ban (law)|ban]] on human genetic engineering.&lt;ref name="Darnovsky Crossroads"/&gt;

[[Science journalist]] [[Ronald Bailey]] claims that McKibben's historical examples are flawed and support different conclusions when studied more closely.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2003"/&gt; For example, few groups are more cautious than the Amish about embracing new technologies, but, though they shun television and use horses and buggies, some are welcoming the possibilities of [[gene therapy]] since inbreeding has afflicted them with a number of rare genetic diseases.&lt;ref name="Stock 2002"/&gt; Bailey and other supporters of technological alteration of human biology also reject the claim that life would be experienced as meaningless if some human limitations are overcome with [[enhancement technologies]] as extremely subjective.

Writing in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, Bailey has accused opponents of research involving the modification of animals as indulging in [[alarmism]] when they speculate about the creation of subhuman creatures with human-like intelligence and brains resembling those of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Bailey insists that the aim of conducting research on animals is simply to produce human [[health care]] benefits.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2001"/&gt;

A different response comes from transhumanist [[personhood theory|personhood theorists]] who object to what they characterize as the anthropomorphobia fueling some criticisms of this research, which science fiction writer [[Isaac Asimov]] termed the "[[Frankenstein complex]]". For example, [[Woody Evans]] argues that, provided they are [[self-aware]], human clones, human-animal chimeras and [[biological uplift|uplifted animals]] would all be unique persons deserving of respect, dignity, rights, responsibilities, and [[citizenship]].&lt;ref Name="Evans 2015"/&gt; They conclude that the coming ethical issue is not the creation of so-called monsters, but what they characterize as the "[[wisdom of repugnance|yuck factor]]" and "[[Human exceptionalism|human-racism]]", that would judge and treat these creations as monstrous.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glenn 2003"/&gt;

At least one [[public interest]] organization, the U.S.-based [[Center for Genetics and Society]], was formed, in 2001, with the specific goal of opposing transhumanist agendas that involve transgenerational modification of human biology, such as full-term [[human cloning]] and [[germinal choice technology]]. The [[Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future]] of the [[Chicago-Kent College of Law]] critically scrutinizes proposed applications of genetic and nanotechnologies to human biology in an academic setting.

=== Socioeconomic effects{{anchor|Genetic divide}} ===
Some critics of [[libertarian transhumanism]] have focused on the likely socioeconomic consequences in societies in which [[economic inequality|divisions between rich and poor]] are on the rise. [[Bill McKibben]], for example, suggests that emerging human enhancement technologies would be disproportionately available to those with greater financial resources, thereby exacerbating the gap between rich and poor and creating a "genetic divide".&lt;ref name="McKibben 2003"/&gt; Even [[Lee M. Silver]], the biologist and [[science writer]] who coined the term "[[reprogenetics]]" and supports its applications, has expressed concern that these methods could create a two-tiered society of genetically engineered "haves" and "have nots" if [[social safety net|social democratic reforms]] lag behind implementation of enhancement technologies.&lt;ref name="Silver 1998"/&gt; The 1997 film ''[[Gattaca]]'' depicts a [[dystopia]]n society in which one's [[social class]] depends entirely on genetic modifications and is often cited by critics in support of these views.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

These criticisms are also voiced by [[criticism of libertarianism|non-libertarian]] transhumanist advocates, especially self-described [[democratic transhumanist]]s, who believe that the majority of current or future [[social issues|social]] and [[environmental issues]] (such as [[unemployment]] and [[resource depletion]]) need to be addressed by a combination of political and technological solutions (like a [[guaranteed minimum income]] and [[alternative technology]]). Therefore, on the specific issue of an emerging genetic divide due to unequal access to human enhancement technologies, bioethicist James Hughes, in his 2004 book ''[[Citizen Cyborg|Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future]]'', argues that [[progressivism|progressives]] or, more precisely, [[techno-progressive]]s must articulate and implement public policies (i.e., a [[universal health care]] [[voucher]] system that covers human enhancement technologies) in order to attenuate this problem as much as possible, rather than trying to ban human enhancement technologies. The latter, he argues, might actually worsen the problem by making these technologies unsafe or available only to the wealthy on the local [[black market]] or in countries where such a ban is not enforced.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Sometimes, as in the writings of [[Leon Kass]], the fear is that various institutions and practices judged as fundamental to civilized society would be damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref name="Kass 2001"/&gt; In his 2002 book ''[[Our Posthuman Future]]'' and in a 2004 ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' magazine article, political economist and philosopher [[Francis Fukuyama]] designates transhumanism as the [[world's most dangerous idea]] because he believes that it may undermine the egalitarian ideals of [[democracy]] (in general) and [[liberal democracy]] (in particular) through a fundamental alteration of "[[human nature]]".&lt;ref name="Fukuyama 2004"/&gt; Social philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] makes a similar argument in his 2003 book ''The Future of Human Nature'', in which he asserts that moral autonomy depends on not being subject to another's unilaterally imposed specifications. Habermas thus suggests that the human "species ethic" would be undermined by embryo-stage genetic alteration.&lt;ref name="Habermas 2004"/&gt; Critics such as Kass, Fukuyama and a variety of authors hold that attempts to significantly alter human biology are not only inherently immoral, but also threaten the [[social order]]. Alternatively, they argue that implementation of such technologies would likely lead to the "naturalizing" of [[social hierarchy|social hierarchies]] or place new means of [[social control|control]] in the hands of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes. [[AI]] pioneer [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] criticizes what he sees as [[misanthropic]] tendencies in the language and ideas of some of his colleagues, in particular Marvin Minsky and [[Hans Moravec]], which, by devaluing the human organism per se, promotes a discourse that enables divisive and undemocratic social policies.&lt;ref name="Platt 1995"/&gt;

In a 2004 article in the libertarian monthly ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]],'' science journalist [[Ronald Bailey]] contested the assertions of Fukuyama by arguing that political equality has never rested on the facts of human biology. He asserts that [[liberalism]] was founded not on the proposition of effective equality of human beings, or ''de facto'' equality, but on the assertion of an equality in political rights and before the law, or ''de jure'' equality. Bailey asserts that the products of genetic engineering may well ameliorate rather than exacerbate human inequality, giving to the many what were once the privileges of the few. Moreover, he argues, "the crowning achievement of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is the principle of [[Toleration|tolerance]]". In fact, he says, political liberalism is already the solution to the issue of human and [[posthuman]] rights since in liberal societies the law is meant to apply equally to all, no matter how rich or poor, powerful or powerless, educated or ignorant, enhanced or unenhanced.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2004"/&gt; Other thinkers who are sympathetic to transhumanist ideas, such as philosopher [[Russell Blackford]], have also objected to the appeal to [[traditional values|tradition]] and what they see as [[alarmism]] involved in ''Brave New World''-type arguments.&lt;ref name="Blackford 2003"/&gt;

=== Specter of coercive eugenicism ===
Some critics of transhumanism see the old [[eugenics]], [[social Darwinist]], and [[master race]] ideologies and programs of the past as warnings of what the promotion of eugenic enhancement technologies might unintentionally encourage. Some fear future "[[Biopolitics|eugenics wars]]" as the worst-case scenario: the return of coercive state-sponsored [[genetic discrimination]] and [[Human rights violations#Human rights violations|human rights violations]] such as [[compulsory sterilization]] of persons with genetic defects, the killing of the institutionalized and, specifically, [[racial segregation|segregation]] and [[genocide]] of [[Social interpretations of race|''races'']]'' ''perceived as inferior.&lt;ref name="Black 2003"/&gt; Health law professor [[George Annas]] and technology law professor [[Lori Andrews]] are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to such human-[[posthuman]] [[caste]] warfare.&lt;ref name="Darnovsky Crossroads"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Annas 2002"/&gt;

The major transhumanist organizations strongly condemn the [[coercion]] involved in such policies and reject the [[scientific racism|racist]] and [[classist]] assumptions on which they were based, along with the [[pseudoscientific]] notions that eugenic improvements could be accomplished in a practically meaningful time frame through selective human breeding.&lt;ref name="Bashford545"&gt;{{cite book | title= The Oxford Handbook of The History of Eugenics | author= [[Bashford, A.]] and [[Levine, P.]] | page= 545| publisher = Oxford University Press | year= 2010 | isbn= 9780195373141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, most transhumanist thinkers advocate a "new eugenics", a form of [[egalitarian]] [[liberal eugenics]].&lt;ref name="WTA FAQ 3.2"/&gt; In their 2000 book ''From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice'', non-transhumanist bioethicists Allen Buchanan, Dan Brock, Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler have argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible (so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals' [[reproductive rights]] or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies) in order to maximize [[public health]] and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements.&lt;ref name="Buchanan 2000"/&gt; Most transhumanists holding similar views nonetheless distance themselves from the term "eugenics" (preferring "[[germinal choice]]" or "[[reprogenetics]]")&lt;ref name="Silver 1998"/&gt; to avoid having their position confused with the discredited theories and practices of early-20th-century eugenic movements.

=== Existential risks ===
{{see also|Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence}}
In his 2003 book ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', British [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Martin Rees]] argues that advanced science and technology bring as much risk of disaster as opportunity for progress. However, Rees does not advocate a halt to scientific activity. Instead, he calls for tighter security and perhaps an end to traditional scientific openness.&lt;ref name="Rees 2003"/&gt; Advocates of the [[precautionary principle]], such as many in the [[environmental movement]], also favor slow, careful progress or a halt in potentially dangerous areas. Some precautionists believe that [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]] present possibilities of alternative forms of cognition that may threaten human life.&lt;ref name="Arnall 2003"/&gt;

Transhumanists do not necessarily rule out specific restrictions on emerging technologies so as to lessen the prospect of [[existential risk]]. Generally, however, they counter that proposals based on the precautionary principle are often [[technorealism|unrealistic]] and sometimes even counter-productive as opposed to the [[technogaian]] current of transhumanism, which they claim is both realistic and productive. In his television series ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'', [[science historian]] [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] dissects several views on [[technological change]], including precautionism and the restriction of [[inquiry|open inquiry]]. Burke questions the practicality of some of these views, but concludes that maintaining the ''[[status quo]]'' of inquiry and development poses hazards of its own, such as a disorienting rate of change and the depletion of our planet's resources. The common transhumanist position is a pragmatic one where society takes deliberate action to ensure the early arrival of the benefits of safe, [[clean technology|clean]], [[alternative technology]], rather than fostering what it considers to be [[anti-science|anti-scientific views]] and [[technophobia]].

[[Nick Bostrom]] argues that even barring the occurrence of a singular [[Global catastrophic risk|global catastrophic event]], basic [[Malthusian]] and evolutionary forces facilitated by technological progress threaten to eliminate the positive aspects of human society.&lt;ref name="bostrom-evolution"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=The Future of Human Evolution|journal=Bedeutung|volume=284|issue=3|pages=8|date=2009|url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html|bibcode=2001SciAm.284c...8R|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0301-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One transhumanist solution proposed by Bostrom to counter existential risks is control of [[differential technological development]], a series of attempts to influence the sequence in which technologies are developed. In this approach, planners would strive to retard the development of possibly harmful technologies and their applications, while accelerating the development of likely beneficial technologies, especially those that offer protection against the harmful effects of others.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"/&gt;

===Authenticity of transhuman goals===
Lara Prendergast has stated that goals of transhumanism, such as trying to cut out food and sex, are inauthentic, because doing so would remove two of the great joys of life. She called transhumanism a part of 'the new narcissism'. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/08/why-are-modern-men-obsessed-with-self-improvement/&lt;/ref&gt;
