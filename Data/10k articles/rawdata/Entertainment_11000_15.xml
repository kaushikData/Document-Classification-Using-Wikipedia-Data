'''''Attack of the Killer Tomatoes''''' is a 1978 [[Musical film|musical]] [[dark comedy]] [[horror film]] produced by J. [[Stephen  Peace]] and John DeBello, and directed by John DeBello based upon an original idea by [[Costa Dillon]]. The screenplay was written by Dillon, Peace, and  DeBello. The film is a spoof of [[B movie]]s. Made on a budget less than [[United States dollar|US$]]100,000, the story involves [[tomato]]es becoming sentient by unknown means and revolting against humanity.    

The success of the film led to three sequels, all co-written by the same three writers and directed by DeBello.

==Plot==
The film opens with a scroll saying that when [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a precredits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's [[garbage disposal]]. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance with which she is covered is not blood, but tomato juice.

A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occurs (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'').  While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that no credible threat exists, the President puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes, led by a man named [[Mason–Dixon line|Mason Dixon]]. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, [[George Washington]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[Adolf Hitler]]; scuba diver Greg Colburn; [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter.

Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could "pass the ketchup." Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason. Meanwhile, the President sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency Mind Makers, where executive Ted Swan spends huge amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys, including a bumper sticker with "STP" for "Stop Tomato Program" on it, a satirical reference to both the real "[[whip inflation now]]" campaign with its widely ridiculed "WIN" slogan and [[STP_(motor_oil_company)|STP motor oil]] decals and bumper stickers which were commonplace in the 1970s. A human is revealed to be also plotting to stop Dixon when a masked assassin attempts to shoot him, but misses. A senate subcommittee meeting is held where one secret pamphlet is leaked to a newspaper editor, who sends Lois Fairchild on the story. While she tails Finletter, he mistakes her for a spy and trashes a hotel room attempting to kill her. He then chases the assassin as the masked man fails again to kill Dixon, but loses him.

Gretta is killed and further regression has led leaders to bring in tanks and soldiers to the West Coast in a battle that leaves the American forces in shambles. Dixon, walking among the rubble, sees a trail of tomato juice and decides to investigate. He ends up being chased by a killer tomato to an apartment where an oblivious child is listening to the radio. The tomato is about to kill Dixon, but suddenly flies out the window. Dixon peers out to see if it has died, and he spots the assassin hijacking his car. He chases the assassin in a "slow car chase" that has since been copied by other comedies. Dixon is eventually knocked out by his own car. Awakening, Dixon finds himself captured by Richardson. Though he did not create the killer tomatoes, he has discovered how to control them and plans to do so once civilization has collapsed - leaving him in control. He is about to reveal his secret of control to Dixon when Finletter charges in and runs him through with his sword. Dixon, picking up some strewn records, realizes that he has seen the  tomatoes retreat at the sound of the song "Puberty Love", but had not put two and two together until now. He orders Finletter to gather all remaining people and bring them to the stadium. Finletter remarks that "only crazy people" are left in the nearly deserted city, resulting in a motley assortment of people in costumes facing the attacking tomatoes at the stadium.

The tomatoes are cornered in a stadium. "Puberty Love" is played over the loudspeaker, causing the tomatoes to shrink and allowing the various people at the stadium to squash them by stomping on them repeatedly. Fairchild, meanwhile, is cornered by a giant tomato wearing earmuffs, hence cannot hear the music. Dixon saves her by showing the tomato the sheet music to "Puberty Love". He professes his love to her, in song. The film ends with a carrot that rises from the soil and says "All right, you guys. They're gone now."

The film also contains the first screen appearance of [[Dana Ashbrook]], then aged 10 or 11, as Boy on Boat (uncredited).

==Production==
The finished film contains footage of a real helicopter crash.  In a scene showing law enforcement officers firing their weapons to ward off tomatoes in a field, a $60,000 [[Hiller Aircraft]] UH-12E that had been rented for the production was supposed to have landed in the tomato patch behind the officers, but during the landing, its tail rotor struck the ground, causing the craft to spin out of control near the ground, roll over, and burst into flames.  The helicopter pilot escaped without serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.check-six.com/lib/Movie_Crash2.htm | title=Movie Crash from Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, July 11th, 1978 | accessdate=April 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crash was caught on film as the cameras were rolling at the time. The crash was later worked into the film.
&lt;!-- what? It was done saying of character Von Schauer who survived the crash saying the helicopter was attacked by a "kamikaze" tomato.
 --&gt;

==Music==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2015}}
The theme song, written by DeBello, describes the tomatoes' rampages through the world, describing that they have killed a man named Herman Farbage while he was taking out the garbage, that the mayor is on vacation to get out of stopping them, that they have scared off the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], and that they have even eaten the [[narrator]]'s sister. This theme song is used in different variations over the course of the series, here simply sounding like the score of an old monster movie with lyrics and a more catchy tune. All other music was written by [[Gordon Goodwin]] and Paul Sundfor with lyrics by Dillon, DeBello, and Peace.

The song "Puberty Love" was sung by the then-teenaged [[Matt Cameron]], who later became the drummer for [[Soundgarden]] and since 1998 has been the drummer for [[Pearl Jam]].

==Critical reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
The film received negative reviews and has become a [[cult film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tomatoes-ripe-a-redo-106635|title='Tomatoes' ripe for a redo|last=Goldstein|first=Gregg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 11, 2008|accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film "isn't even worthy of sarcasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1978/film/reviews/attack-of-the-killer-tomatoes-1200424541/|title=Review: 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|year=1978|accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Sequels===

* ''[[Return of the Killer Tomatoes]]!'' (1988)
* ''[[Killer Tomatoes Strike Back]]!'' (1990)
* ''[[Killer Tomatoes Eat France]]!'' (1991)

The sequel ''Return of the Killer Tomatoes'' picks up the story 10 years later. The film is notable for the casting of [[George Clooney]] in one of his first film roles.
 
American composer and orchestrator Gordon Goodwin, one of the original composers for the film, later wrote an Emmy-nominated, big-band piece inspired by the music for this film, to be played with his jazz ensemble [[Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band]].   

===Adaptations, parodies, and spin-offs===

* [[Kim Harrison]]'s book series ''The Hollows'' is based in a world where genetically engineered tomatoes killed off a significant portion of the human population.

'''''Battlerite''''' is a [[free-to-play]] team-based [[action game]] based on [[multiplayer online battle arena]] (MOBA) gameplay&lt;ref name="kotaku"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Allen|first1=Eric|title=Battlerite Is A True MOBA, And Thank God|url=https://compete.kotaku.com/battlerite-is-a-true-moba-and-thank-god-1820989224|website=Kotaku|accessdate=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PCG200k&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pcgamer.com/how-battlerite-already-found-200000-players-and-whats-coming-next/| title=How Battlerite already found 200,000 players, and what's coming next| author=Tom Marks| work=[[PC Gamer]]| date=October 7, 2016| accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Eric|title=Battlerite is bite-sized MOBA mayhem|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/battlerite-is-bite-sized-moba-mayhem/|website=PC Gamer|accessdate=April 19, 2018|date=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Allegra|title=Is Battlerite the next smash-hit MOBA?|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/22/13016470/battlerite-steam-gameplay|website=Polygon|accessdate=April 19, 2018|date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed and published by Stunlock Studios. The game is considered a [[spiritual successor]] to ''[[Bloodline Champions]]'' and is created by the same developers. An [[early access]] version of the game was released in September 2016, selling over 440,000 copies within three months, and was officially released on November 7, 2017.

In May 2018, the developers announced the development of a new free-to-play game mode based on the [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] genre planned to be released in the summer of the same year. In August 2018, the developers announced that the game mode would no longer be free and instead would be released as a standalone game planned to be released by the end of September of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/battlerite-developers-detail-battle-royale-bonuses-for-existing-owners/|title=Battlerite developer details battle royale bonuses for existing owners|publisher=[[PC_Gamer|PC Gamer]]|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Battlerite consists of two teams, with two or three players each, battling against each other. Before the game begins, each player chooses a unique playable character called a Champion with unique offensive, defensive, and movement abilities. Defeating every player on the enemy team wins the round for your team, and winning three rounds wins your team the game. Rounds have a timer of around two minutes, and when the timer runs out a Sudden Death boundary appears which gradually forces players into a small area in the center of the map. Games may be played on one of several maps, each favoring different strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Battlerite? Basics |url=https://guides.gamepressure.com/battlerite/guide.asp?ID=38416|accessdate=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike traditional [[multiplayer online battle arena|MOBA]] games, the goal of the game is not to destroy towers or other base structures. Additionally, players do not kill neutral units to gain resources, and therefore players cannot buy items or other resources in the game to augment their character's stats or abilities. This leads to an action-focused gameplay with in short matches compared to the longer strategy-focused games common in the genre.&lt;ref name="kotaku"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Battlerite'' received mainly favorable reviews from critics; on aggregate review website [[Metacritic]] the game attains an overall score of 85 out of 100.&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/battlerite/|title=Battlerite|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

PC Gamer gave the game a score of 89%, praising the game's pace, free-to-play model, and simplicity compared to other games in its genre.&lt;ref name="PCGamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/battlerite-review/|title=Battlerite Review|publisher=[[PC_Gamer|PC Gamer]]|accessdate=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, IGN's Ian Nowakowski gave Battlerite a score of 8.2/10. While criticizing the randomized progression rewards as "lackluster," Nowakowski concludes "Battlerite strikes true where it counts, and that’s in the arena. The teamfighting hits hard at the core of what makes competitive gaming so engaging hour after hour."&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/08/battlerite-review|title=Battlerite Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Battlerite quickly rose in popularity upon launch. Two weeks after the game launched on [[Steam_(software)|Steam]]'s [[Early Access]], Stunlock Studios claimed they had already amassed 200,000 players, despite the fact that at the time the game was pay-to-play.&lt;ref name="PCG200k"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of right now, Battlerite has a small player base. According to SteamCharts, in 2017 player count peaked in November with 44,850 players in that month; as of 2018 the average monthly peak has decreased to less than 4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steamcharts.com/app/504370#All|title=Battlerite|publisher=Steam Charts|accessdate=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PC Gamer included Battlerite in its list of the best free games on the [[Steam_(software)|Steam platform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-free-games-on-steam/|title=Best free Steam Games|publisher=[[PC_Gamer|PC Gamer]]|accessdate=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blerta''' (''"Bruno Lawrence's Electric Revelation and Travelling Apparition"'') was a [[New Zealand]] musical and theatrical co-operative active in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/blerta-revisited-2001|title=Blerta Revisited  {{!}} Film {{!}} NZ On Screen|website=www.nzonscreen.com|language=en|others=NZ On Screen|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.audioculture.co.nz/people/blerta|title=BLERTA - AudioCulture|last=Newman|first=Keith|date=9 May 2013|website=www.audioculture.co.nz|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/blerta-mn0001755320/biography|title=Blerta {{!}} Biography &amp; History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the idea of [[Bruno Lawrence]] to arrange a group of musicians, actors and friends, who would travel around New Zealand on a tour to get away from the pressure of the music and movie scene. He organised the travelling group, and in October 1971, they departed on their tour. The group travelled around New Zealand in a very distinctive red bus, concluding in January 1973 at the first large outdoor [[music festival in New Zealand]], [[The Great Ngaruawahia Music Festival]]&lt;ref name="Bruce Sergent"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sergent.com.au/music/blerta.html | title=Blerta | publisher=Bruce Sergent | accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; before heading up the eastern seaboard of Australia and performing at the 1973 [[Aquarius Festival]] at the [[Northern Rivers]] NSW [[hippie]] town of [[Nimbin, New South Wales|Nimbin]].

The group lived in a commune for many years. Three families, including Bruno Lawrence's and Geoff Murphy's, lived together. The group came to the attention of those in the New Zealand film industry and were at times employed to create work for TVNZ. The group were labeled as hippies during this time and were looked down upon by some in the industry despite the quality and nature of their work. 
 
Throughout the years that Blerta traveled the line up changed, over time members included Lawrence, [[Fane Flaws]], [[Beaver (singer)|Beaver]], [[Geoff Murphy]], [[Tony Barry]], [[Ian Watkin]], Mick Liber as well as many others, of which some had previously worked with Bruno in bands and others joined along the way&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noted.co.nz/archive/listener-nz-2013/from-our-archive-bruno-did-his-thing/|title=From our archive: Bruno did his thing  - The Listener|last=Noted|website=Noted|language=en|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The original line up was Bruno Lawrence, [[Corben Simpson]], Kemp Turirangi, Geoff Murphy, Alan Moon, Tony Littlejohn, Beaver, Eric Foley, and Chris Seresin. The great adventure and experience of Blerta finished in 1975 when the troupe went out with one last tour.

Although Bruno Lawrence and Geoff Murphy were friends for many years the two had a falling out five years prior to Bruno Lawrence's death. The two never reconciled and Murphy was absent from Lawrence's funeral.

The effect of '''[[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] on [[time perception]]''' has been studied with inconclusive results.&lt;ref name="Atakan"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=January 2012|title=The effect of cannabis on perception of time: a critical review|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|volume=18|issue=32|pages=4915–4922|issn=1873-4286|pmid=22716134|vauthors=Atakan Z, Morrison P, Bossong MG, Martin-Santos R, Crippa JA|doi=10.2174/138161212802884852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show consistently throughout the literature that most cannabis users self-report the experience of a slowed perception of time.&lt;ref name="Stolick"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kHcTOyXB7UC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Otherwise Law-Abiding Citizens: A Scientific and Moral Assessment of Cannabis Use|vauthors=Stolick M|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2008|isbn=9780739131619|location=Lanham, MD|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=December 2003|title=Being stoned: a review of self-reported cannabis effects|journal=Drug and Alcohol Review|volume=22|issue=4|pages=453–460|doi=10.1080/09595230310001613976|issn=0959-5236|pmid=14660135|vauthors=Green B, Kavanagh D, Young R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the laboratory, researchers have confirmed the effect of cannabis on the perception of time in both humans and animals.&lt;ref name="Iversen"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=June 2003|title=Cannabis and the brain|url=https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/126/6/1252/330602/Cannabis-and-the-brain|journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology|volume=126|issue=Pt 6|pages=1252–1270|issn=0006-8950|pmid=12764049|vauthors=Iversen L|doi=10.1093/brain/awg143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have sought to explain how cannabis changes the internal clock.

==Psychoactive effects==
Reports of the [[effects of cannabis]] on time perception can be found first in arts and literature, and then in medical reports and studies. Notable discussions of the effects occur in "Le Club des Hachichin" (1846), a work  by French poet [[Théophile Gautier]], and in ''[[Les Paradis Artificiels]]'' (1860), a work by [[Charles Baudelaire]].  French physician [[Jacques-Joseph Moreau]] studied the effects of cannabis with the help of Gautier and other artists who experimented with hashish in the [[Club des Hashischins]].&lt;ref name="Earleywine"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QUn92XLQqf8C&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Understanding Marijuana: A New Look at the Scientific Evidence|vauthors=Earleywine M|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780199881437|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreau published his findings in ''Hashish and Mental Illness: Psychological Studies'' (1846), noting that hashish caused "errors of time and space" and "time dragging".&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJgsAAAAYAAJ|title=The Marijuana Question: And Science's Search for an Answer|vauthors=Jones HC, Lovinger PW|publisher=Dodd, Mead|year=1985|isbn=0396083994|location=New York|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in 1958, South African physician [[Frances Ames]] studied the effects of cannabis extract, noting the "disordered time perception" experienced by her subjects where "brief periods seemed immensely long".&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;Jones, Helen Cc; Paul W. Lovinger (1985) ''The Marijuana Question and Science's Search for an Answer''. Dodd Mead. {{ISBN|0396083994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; American poet [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s "First Manifesto to End the Bringdown" (1966) noted that "the vast majority all over the world who have smoked the several breaths necessary to feel the effect, adjust to the strangely familiar sensation of Time slow-down."&lt;ref name="Ginsberg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/66nov/hoax.htm|title=The Great Marijuana Hoax: First Manifesto to End the Bringdown|date=November 1966|website=Atlantic Monthly|pages=104, 107–112|access-date=27 April 2017|vauthors=Ginsberg A}} ([https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/66nov/hoax2.htm part two of article])&lt;/ref&gt;  American physician [[Jerome Groopman]] of Harvard Medical School, reported that the "perception of time is altered, generally with perceived time faster than clock time" in people who have ingested cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;Groopman, Jerome. (February 20, 2014). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/feb/20/marijuana-high-and-low/ Marijuana: The High and the Low]. ''The New York Review of Books''. Retrieved August 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple review studies have confirmed these reports.&lt;ref name="Chait"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1992|title=Effects of smoked marijuana on human performance: a critical review|url=|journal=Marijuana/cannabinoids: Neurobiology and neurophysiology|volume=387|pages=423|vauthors=Chait LD, Pierri J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atakan" /&gt;

==In music==
Most notably, cannabis has had a long association among musicians and the music industry.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,777874,00.html|title=Music: The Weed, Teenage|last=|first=|date=19 July 1943|website=www.druglibrary.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429000225/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C777874%2C00.html|archive-date=29 April 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=27 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fachner, Jörg (July 2001).

Contrary to the effects produced by stimulant use, cannabis use is reported to give the performer or listener a subjective perception of time expansion, resulting in the overestimation of the passage of time.  Dosage and method of ingestion may lessen or accentuate this effect.  This subjective effect of time expansion is responsible for most of the anecdotal accounts in the literature. The effects of cannabis on musicians and those who listen to music are the subject of research in [[social pharmacology]] and [[music therapy]].&lt;ref name="Aldridge2006"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dewPBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Music and Altered States: Consciousness, Transcendence, Therapy and Addiction|vauthors=Aldridge D, Fachner J|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year=2006|isbn=9781843103738|location=Philadelphia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldridge2005"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9YPBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Case Study Designs in Music Therapy|vauthors=Aldridge D|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year=2005|isbn=9781843101406|location=Philadelphia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Booth"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mjn6sCiHoFIC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Cannabis: A History|vauthors=Booth M|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=9781409084891|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30845">'''Community media''' are any form of media that function in service of or by a community. It is the rise of all kinds of alternative, oppositional, participatory and collaborative media practices that have developed in the journalistic context of ‘community media,’ ‘we media,’ ‘citizens media,’ ‘grassroot journalism’ or any radical alternative to on and offline mainstream journalistic practices &lt;ref&gt;[http:/Deuze, M. (2006).7(3), 262-280. doi:10.1177/1464884906065512], "Ethnic media, community media and participatory culture. Journalism: Theory, Practice &amp; Criticism".&lt;/ref&gt;.  In other words, it is having access to or creating local alternatives to mainstream broadcasting &lt;ref&gt;[Milan, S. (2009) 19(4-5), 598-609. doi:10.1080/09614520902866421], "Four steps to community media as a development tool. Development in Practice".&lt;/ref&gt;, like local community newspapers, radio stations, or magazines&lt;ref&gt;[Opubor, A. E. (2000).1-25], If community media is the answer, what is the question. Promoting community media in Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;. Community Media aids in the process of building citizenship and raising social awareness. “Participation” and “access” are a large aspect in the rise of community media. Those who create media are being encouraged to involve themselves in providing a platform for others to express views. Community media is often given parameters when being defined by groups, but often challenges these boundaries with its broad yet narrow structure&lt;ref name="rennie-community-media" /&gt;.

Community media are generally defined as a distinct sector of the media for their independence, base in civil society and provision of a social service as opposed to seeking profits.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002150/215097e.pdf "Community Media: A Good Practice Handbook"] 2011. Retrieved 2018-07-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KEA European Affairs [http://keanet.eu/report/communitymedia.html "The State of Community Media in the European Union. Research Report Prepared for the European Parliament"] 2007. Retrieved 2018-07-27&lt;/ref&gt; They serve as a third sector of the media apart from private and public media and are important in giving communities a platform to express their concerns for local issues, engage in democratic debate and deliver a reliable access to information. However, there is no consensus on a definition as each region displays unique forms of community media.

==Modes of community media==
Community media can take all the forms of other conventional media, such as print, radio, television, Web-based and mixed media.

[[Community radio]] is particularly widespread around the world with radio stations being founded to inform their listeners on issues important to the community.

==Grassroots media==
[[Grassroots]] media is focused more specifically on media making by and for the local community that it serves making the discussion more narrow and precise.&lt;ref&gt;Riismandel, Paul [https://web.archive.org/web/20081006211953/http://www.mediageek.org/rfc/media.html "About Grassroots and Community Media"] September 1996. Retrieved 2013-04-30&lt;/ref&gt; It is essentially a subset focusing on small scale media projects which aim to bring different visions and perspectives to the "codes" ,that are so easily embedded in the social psyche.&lt;ref name = rennie-community-media&gt;{{cite book | last = Rennie | first = Ellie | title = Community Media: A Global Introduction (Critical Media Studies) | date = 2006-06-28 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | location = Lanham, Md | isbn = 978-0-7425-3925-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}{{clarify|date=May 2013}}

==Challenges==
Despite the social service they provide through their focus on local issues, community media often face a number of challenges, including unfavourable regulation, censorship, unfair licensing processes, inequitable access to the frequency spectrum, lack of formal recognition, low funding, lack of skilled journalists and media professionals, and competition from private and state broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO [https://en.unesco.org/community-media-sustainability/policy-series/defining "Community Media Sustainability Policy Briefs"] 2017.

=={{anchor|History by geographic area}}By region==

=== USA ===
{{relevance|date=May 2013}}&lt;!-- this text focusses on "public media" not "community media"--&gt; 
The first [[Public-access television]] station in the [[United States]] considered to be community media was set up in 1968 in Dale City, Virginia. It was managed by the city's Junior Chamber of Commerce and ran programming for two years without advertising. It closed due to lack of financing, equipment, and infrastructure.&lt;ref name = olson&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.geocities.com/iconostar/history-public-access-TV.html|title = The History Of Public Access Television|last = Olson|first = Bill|date=  2000-05-12|accessdate=2007-05-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615171239/http://www.geocities.com/iconostar/history-public-access-TV.html|archivedate=2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} Another early example of community media is found in the counter-culture video collectives of the 1960s and 1970s.

[[Videofreex]], Video Free America, and Global Village&lt;!-- Global Village (radio show) was a CBC radio show --&gt; used new technologies to the benefit of community interests. In addition, the [[Raindance Corporation]] founded by Michael Shamberg, Paul Ryan, and others became known as "[[guerrilla television]]." The premise of guerrilla television was to non-violently blaze a new trail for the creation of media as an alternative to broadcast television. This initial activity was made possible by Sony's introduction of the video [[Porta-Pak]].&lt;ref name = olson/&gt;{{rp|6}}

==== Current status ====
Community media in the US does have some lobbying efforts. One of these is the Alliance for Community Media, which “works to protect the interests of [communitymedia centers]”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allcommunitymedia.org/about-us|title=Alliance for Community Media|last=|first=|date=2017|website=allcommunitymedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not provide technical training for running multimedia operations rather, they work to support these centers through advocacy and education about what community media is.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A major resource for those seeking access to community media in the United States is the Community Media Database. The Community Media Database acts as a directory for the community media companies located around the United States. Here, users can use the interactive map to find community media access in their area, as well as other resources on organizations whose focus is to advance the cause of community media within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://communitymediadatabase.org/|title=Community Media Database|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance for Community Media also represents local community groups, public schools, religious institutions, colleges and universities, government officials, second language communities, and national institutions (NASA, the US Department ofEducation, the US Army).To become a single member of the alliance one must pay an fee of $200.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This fee is for those who work for the cause of Community Media and the ACM (e.g. staff, government officials, board directors). Supporters can pay a fee of only $50 and get membership to the regional group, single access to the ACM listserv, and discounted rates to ACM and Regional conferences and educational events. Examples of people who would get the supporter members are volunteers, students, and retirees. However anyone can sign up to get updates and newsletters from the ACM for free. An example of Community Media can be found in Washington, D.C., with a focus on the fight to gain statehood for D.C. One site for community media include the DCi Reporter which is an online website reporting D.C. area news and statehood news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dcireporter.com/|title=DCiReporter|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the public access, DCTV which has a wide variety of programming for D.C. residents, and also reports on D.C. statehood news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dctv.org/|title=DCTV|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Benton Foundation is a non-profit organization founded by Charles Benton in 1981 to ensure that media “serves the public interest and enhances democracy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.benton.org/about|title=Benton Foundation|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation seeks to raise awareness and accessibility to community within the United States. They also have a strong focus on ensuring that media contentis responsive and centralized to local communities.

=== Canada ===
Canada also has a central role in the development of community media and is by many considered the birthplace of community broadcasting.&lt;ref name = rennie-community-media/&gt;{{rp|48}} In the 1960s, the National Film Board of Canada set up a project called Challenge for Change which was a series of documentary films addressing socio-economic issues. Once again Sony's Porta-Pak proved revolutionary in Canada as well. In 1968, filmmakers Bonny Klein and Dorothy He`naut persuaded Challenge for Change to take on more local community issues. During the same year they trained members of the St. Jacques Citizens' Committee in video production. The committee went into the Montreal slums and captured interview footage with poor people and then presented the video in public meetings for discussion.&lt;ref name = olson/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The history of community radio dates back to amateur radio organizations that formed in 1906.&lt;ref name = rennie-community-media/&gt;{{rp|62}} From a historical perspective, the seminal example of community radio is Lewis Hill's [[Pacifica Radio]]. [[KPFA]] in Berkeley, California began broadcasting in 1949 after acquiring an FCC license for FM spectrum. This first Pacifica station was funded through listener support and philanthropic foundations. Pacifica's mandate, that Hill expressed as "to engage in any activity that shall contribute to the lasting understanding between nations and between the individuals of all nations, races, creeds, and colors," has served to frame the community media movement through its historical and technological development.&lt;ref name = rennie-community-media/&gt;{{rp|64}}

=== China ===
Community media in China serves as a tool for the propaganda department to promote its ideologies. It is a strictly government operated media includes television, radio and newspaper. This refers to the unique historical condition (Tiananmen Square Protests)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/root-of-the-tiananmen-square-protests-688411|title=What Caused the Tiananmen Square Protests?|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a wealthy and powerful Communist Party-governed state that lacks democracy. The Communist Party governs everything and everyone, and answers to thing but itself. It stands above the law. WeChat has all the features of Facebook Messenger, the usefulness of Venmo and Paypal. Users can post Moments on their walls, order taxi service or movie tickets, and in general utilize the app not just for communication but for daily services. Anything that is posted on or is sent out to friends on WeChat are being monitored by the Chinese government.

“Sina weibo” is like a Chinese microblog. There are almost 540 million people are users of Sina weibo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weibo.com/|title=Homepage Weibo|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a stage for people to post their comments, pictures, videos, articles and advertisements. Now, there are many celebrities using this stage to post advertisement and get more attention from people, not only the Chinese celebrities are using Sina weibo, there are some Korean, Hollywood celebrities are communicating with their followers through this special community media. Anyone can register an account and it has to be verified by the real ID. But people do not have to use their real information after resisting, and they are free to talk about their own life but if there are some information that against the political policy, then it will be deleted. 

===Bangladesh===
Community media are widely recognized by governments, international development agencies, and civil society organizations alike as key agents of participatory development. Their reach and practices are a unique way of reaching and involving people. This is particularly true of community radio, the most prevalent of all community media, which is a vital alternative both to state owned and commercial private radio. Community radio‘s affordability and reach make it a powerful agent of social change.

Recognition of community radio as a legitimate and key element in development efforts and the potential to empower marginalized and disenfranchised communities, has pushed a number of countries to introduce laws and regulations that acknowledge community radios as a distinct media sector. In those countries an enabling environment for community radios has been created.

Despite these advances, challenges persist at global and regional level and in their joint 2010 statement the four international special UN mandated rapporteurs on freedom of expression (*) expressed their concerns at the lack of specific legal recognition of the community broadcasting sector in licensing systems which are based on criteria that are appropriate to this sector as well as the failure to reserve adequate frequencies for community broadcasters or to establish appropriate funding support mechanism .

The Ministry of Information Government of People’s Republic of Bangladesh has declared Community Radio Installation, Broadcast and Operation Policy 2008, which was the citizens’ expectation since the year 1998. Accordingly in April, 2010, Ministry of Information has approved 14 Community Radio Stations to operate for the first time in the country.

After the approval of license Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has allocated frequency and then the Community Radio stations started broadcasting from 2011.

Now 14 Community Radio Stations are on-air in the country, aiming to ensure empowerment and right to information for the rural community. They are broadcasting altogether 120 hours program per day on information, education, local entertainment and development motivation activities. Around 536 Youth Women &amp; Youth are now working with those Stations throughout the country as rural broadcasters

These programs are quite supportive to the activities reflected in 6th 5-year plan of Government of Bangladesh, UN World Summit on the Information Society (UN WSIS) Action Plan, and UN Millennium Development Goals (UN MDGs) and UN Convention Against Corruption (UN CAC)

The success of the 1st batch of Community Radio stations has earned appreciation from all levels because of their commendable success. For that we give our thanks to those initiating organizations.

We are also giving thanks to the Ministry of Information that it is because of their good intention and sincere efforts which made possible a full-fledged community radio policy, the only one in South East Asia. India has got only a Guideline to operate Community Radio stations, while Nepal does not have any of this kind. In 2012 Ministry of Information has declared National Strategy for Community Radio to support implementation of Community Radio Installation, broadcast and Operation Policy.

Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication is promoting the advocacy with the government in relations to community radio with other organizations since its emergence from 2000. BNNRC has been addressing the community radio and community TV access issue for over a decade, helping to bridge the information gap of rural Bangladesh.

The reality of today is that the bondage between the community people and local-level community radio stations are getting strengthened day-by-day. Community Radio has now become their part of life. Community Radio becomes the instrument for the livelihood battle of the rural people.

Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication established the Community Media News Agency (CMNA), Community Media Academy (CMA) and Monthly Community Media to share development news &amp; building capacity for the Community Media sector in Bangladesh.

We have now started advocacy with the Government of Bangladesh to open up Community Television for Development. We hope that, community television will come into being within a short time in Bangladesh.

In this context the present status of community radio stations regarding social, economic and institutional sustainability can be pointed as below:

Social Sustainability:
i.	Management Committee formed at 14 Community Radio station level
ii.	Advisory Committee formed for each station that included UNO and Additional District Commissioner
iii.	2115 Listeners Clubs formed at CR Station level
iv.	The present number of CR listeners is around 46,47,000
v.	People of 67 Upazila under 13 districts now listen Community Radio Programs

Sustainability at Govt. level: 
i.	Ministry of Information declared Community Radio Installation, broadcast and operation Policy 2008.
ii.	Ministry of Information prepared and declared Community Radio Strategy 2012
iii.	Digital Bangladesh Strategy Paper-prepared by the Prime Minister’s Office
iv.	Charter of Chang 2008
Institutional Sustainability 
i.	Presently 14 community radio stations are broadcasting different stations
ii.	Every day all the stations are broadcasting a total of 109 hours program
iii.	Code of Conduct for Community Radio formulated 
iv.	Gender Policy for Community Radio prepared and published
iv.	Human Resource Development Policy formulation for Community Radio Stations (in process) 
v.	Financial Management Policy formulation (in process)

Economic Sustainability 
i.	Non-Profitable business model (under process) 
ii.	Funding of development partners
iii.	Facilitation of Initiating organization
iv.	Formulation and Implementation of Development Advertisement Policy 
v.	Sharing allocation of local and national budget/s.
vi.	Community Radio Development Fund creation and operation.

Potentials of Community Radio in Bangladesh
a.	Community Radio has created scope for the poor and marginalized community to raise their own voice; it becomes the voice for the voiceless. This neo-media outlets opened scope to establish their rights of Information and communication in social, political, cultural and environmental arena.

b.	Scope widened for poverty reduction and sustainable development because of the rights to raise voice of the community and accessibility to knowledge and information.

c.	Scope opened for exchange of dialogue between local elected representatives, govt. and NGO professionals for the sake of establishing good governance.

d.	Direct linkage established between the community and the main sectors reflected in MDGs and 6th 5-year plan.

e.	Scope created for Social debate, inclusion and preservation of cultural diversity by ensuring the inclusion of the marginalized community.

f.	Community Radio is now able to play more active role in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) due to establishment of effective linkage between the govt. departments and local/rural community.

Already the Community radio programs have been widely accepted among the local community.14 community radio stations presently covers more than 4.6 million listeners. This journey was not a bed of roses, we are to cross ups and downs-everyday we are to face newer challenges.

The Community Radios are becoming an active ground for organizing dialogues at rural level. These dialogues will help the rural mass to find out their own voice and ensure leverage their free opinion in respect of social, economic, political, cultural and environmental issues

===Europe===
{{unbalanced|date=May 2013}}
{{one source|date=May 2013}}
Community television and radio in Europe arose "from criticism of a monopolistic public service system that was considered out of touch".&lt;ref name = rennie-community-media/&gt;{{rp|78}} The experimental period of community media expression in Europe began in the 1970s after North American Public-access television was underway. It was therefore seen as a model but also understood that the media environments were structurally different.&lt;ref name = rennie-community-media/&gt;{{rp|82}}

A powerful community media example external to both North America and Europe is the Bolivian Miners' Radio of the 1940s. The station was established by the local miner's union and became an important tool for communication, resistance, and educational and cultural expression.&lt;ref name = rennie-community-media/&gt;{{rp|17}}

===Chile===

During the 1960s and 1970s, several catholic groups across Latin America drawing inspiration from [[liberation theology]], formed their own community media projects from Patagonia to the Rio Grande. They explored several diverse technologies including theater, dance, puppets, mural paint, loudspeakers in their alternative media projects. One of the key figures in this media restructuring process was the Catholic Bishop Juan Luis Ysern and his communication project Radio Estrella Del Mar(REM), located on the archipelago of Chiloe in Southern Chile. REM was first conceived as a medium that serves the communities in the region of Chiloe. Started during the period of Pinochet dictatorship, REM produced several radio shows and news features and still continues to broadcast locally produced programmes by the communities 24 hours a day. The current director of REM, Miguel Millar says: 

"The ultimate goal of the project is to ensure that both the administration of the radio and most of the programming stay under the control of the community."

[[UNESCO]] released the Community Media Sustainability Policy Series&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO [https://en.unesco.org/community-media-sustainability/policy-series "Community Media Sustainability Policy Series"] 2017. Retrieved 2018-07-27&lt;/ref&gt; to help community broadcasters overcome the obstacles they face in establishing and sustaining their operations. This series presents the following recommendations&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO [http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/news/community_media_sustainability_recommendations_en.pdf "International Seminar on Community Media Sustainability: Strengthening Policies and Funding. Recommendations"] 2015. Retrieved 2018-07-27&lt;/ref&gt; put forward by stakeholders and participants at an international seminar for Community Media Sustainability: Strengthening Policies and Funding event held by UNESCO in 2015 to promote a healthy policy environment:

''Definition of community broadcasting'': community broadcasters should be defined by their independent nature, community governance and focus on issues of local concern.

''Formal recognition'': community broadcasters should be considered separate from private and state media in a country’s laws and given the same protection afforded to other media.

''Licensing'': a country should ensure that licensing procedures are fair and transparent, as well as less demanding than the process for commercial media.

''Spectrum'': a minimum percentage of the broadcasting spectrum should be reserved for community media use.

''Provision of public funding'': countries should ensure that a continued source of funding is provided for community broadcasters to apply for to increase their sustainability.

''Access to Private Funding and Support'': community broadcasters should be allowed the right to utilize private sources of funding, such as income through advertising.

''Digital provisions'': countries should ensure that community media can access and afford opportunities in the digital space.

==Minorities==
Minorities are typically underrepresented in community media in the United States, according to a 2015 study by the [[American Society of News Editors]] and the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at [[Florida International University]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/09/15/how-community-media-can-encourage-minority-communities-to-engage/#5380c9d9203c|title=How Community Media Can Encourage Minority Communities To Engage|last=Stevens|first=Genia|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Forbes Community Voices are typically seen as SPS, however this is by a representative of the Forbes Agency Council so may be reliable?|date=June 2018}} Genia Stevens has stated that by "creating a space where minority communities have the tools to spread their message to a larger audience, community media provides a platform that allows authentic relationships to develop, grow and thrive".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Forbes Community Voices are typically seen as SPS, however this is by a representative of the Forbes Agency Council so may be reliable?|date=June 2018}}

These skills can be learned by different minority groups and this education can provide numerous opportunities.

[[File:Crashed Ice skater with downtown St. Paul, Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Crashed Ice skater in downtown [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]]]
'''Crashed Ice''' (full official name: ''[[Red Bull]] Crashed Ice'') is a world tour in the [[winter sport|winter]] [[extreme sport|extreme]] sporting event, ''[[ice cross downhill]]'' (or downhill ice cross), which involves downhill [[Ice skating|skating]] in an urban environment, on a track which includes steep turns and high vertical drops. The series was created and is managed by energy drinks company [[Red Bull]]. It is similar to [[ski cross]] and [[snowboard cross]], except with [[ice skates]] on an ice track, instead of skis or snowboards on a snow track.&lt;ref&gt;Red Bull, [http://www.redbull.com/cs/Satellite/en_INT/Article/Ice-Cross-Downhill-The-Sport-021242790121337 "Ice Cross - Downhill"] (accessed 2012-01-20)&lt;/ref&gt;

Competitors, having advanced from one of the tryouts in the prior months, race in heats of four skaters, with the top two advancing from each heat.  Racers, typically [[ice hockey]] players (however, the seven times single event winner [[Jasper Felder]] was a [[bandy]] player,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bandysidan.nu/player.php?SpelareID=219 Jasper Felder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bandysidan.nu/foton/dbf/2009_VM_USA_Jasper_F_Stor.JPG Image of Jasper Felder playing bandy for USA]&lt;/ref&gt; who in that sport represented [[United States national bandy team|USA]], while in ice cross dowhill represented [[Sweden]]), [[Ice hockey equipment|outfitted as such]], speed down the course’s turns, berms, and jumps.

==World championship era==
From 2010 onwards a points system was introduced. After the season, the skater with the most points is crowned the world champion. Points are awarded to the top 100 racers. Points are awarded starting with 1000 for the winner, after that 800, 600, 500 and decreasing to 0.5 for place 100.

For the 2015 season, the Riders Cup events were instituted. The events were designed to make the sport more accessible to more skaters. For these events, skaters can earn up to 25% of the points that the main events are awarded, with percentages decreasing with each placing. Meaning that the winner receives 250 points, which is 25% of the main event 1000 points and it decreases to 1% of the main event points for the 64th finisher, who receives 2.5 points. Any placings 65th and beyond do not score any points.

As well, a new wrinkle was added to the overall championship called the "throw out" rule. If a competitor competes in all of the stops, up to a maximum of 12 events in future years, the lowest main event score and the lowest Riders Cup score will be thrown out. This will give the skater an adjusted score for the overall championship. Thus, meaning that it is in the skater's best interest to compete in all events.

'''Cuban folk music''' includes a variety of traditional [[folk music]] of [[Cuba]], and has been influenced by the [[Spanish culture|Spanish]] and the [[African culture]] as well as the remaining indigenous population of the [[Caribbean]].

== Classification of genres ==

During the 1960s, a methodological organization was consistently applied to the Cuban popular music; and that methodology, called of the "generic complexes" was mainly based on the works of Cuban musicologist Argeliers León. In his book Del canto y el tiempo, León divided the study of Cuban popular music in several sections presented in the following order: ''Música yoruba'', ''Música bantú'', ''Música abakuá'', ''Música guajira'', ''El son'', ''La rumba'', ''La guaracha'', ''La canción y el bolero'', ''Música instrumental'', ''De la contradanza al danzón, al chachachá'' and ''Hacia el presente, en el presente''.

Dr. Olavo Alén says about the "generic complex system": "In his book Música Folklórica Cubana as well as in his opus masterpiece Del canto y el tiempo, he (León) shows us a panoramic view of our music departing fundamentally from the description of the original genres of Cuba. But those divisions proposed by Argeliers didn't pretend to be as rigorous as a scientific organization that would be in compliance with the classificatory principles of coherence, exclusivity, exhaustivity and most importantly, dychotomy."&lt;ref&gt;Alén Rodríguez, Olavo: Historia y teoría de los complejos genéricos de la música cubana, Revista Clave, Publicación del Instituto Cubano de la Música. ISSN 0864-1404. Año 12, Número 1, 2010, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Cuban popular music "Generic complex theory", Cuban folk music is classified as follows:

* [[Punto cubano]] Complex, with its variations Punto libre y Punto fijo. 
* [[Rumba]] Complex, with its components Yambú, [[Guaguancó]], Columbia, [[Conga]] and [[Comparsa]]. 
* [[Danzón]] Complex, with its variants [[Contradanza]], [[Danzón]], [[Danzonete]], [[Mambo (music)|Mambo]] and [[Cha-cha-chá (music)|Cha-cha-chá]]. 
* [[Son (music)|Son]] Complex, with its modalities [[Changüí]], Sucu-sucu and [[Guaracha]].
* [[Canción]] Complex, with its variants [[Bolero]] and [[Filin (music)|Filin]].&lt;ref&gt;Alén Rodríguez, Olavo: Historia y teoría de los complejos genéricos de la música cubana, Revista Clave, Publicación del Instituto Cubano de la Música. ISSN 0864-1404. Año 12, Número 1, 2010, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Generic  complex theory" has been refuted since long time ago by renowned musicologists such as Leonardo Acosta, which explains in his article titled "About the Generic Complexes and other matters":&lt;ref&gt;Acosta, Leonardo. De los complejos genéricos y otras cuestiones. Clave. Publicación del Instituto Cubano de la Música. Año 4, No. 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cita| ''Fortunately, the theology [sic.] of the generic complexes has been viewed with skepticism within the musicology circles from various countries, including Cuba, where some musicologists have oscillated between rejection, skepticism and depise…''}}

According to Cuban composer and musicographist [[Armando Rodríguez Ruidíaz]]:&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Ruidíaz, Armando: La metodología de los "Complejos Genéricos" y el análisis de la música popular cubana autóctona, 2017: https://www.academia.edu/31616832/La_metodolog%C3%ADa_de_los_Complejos_Gen%C3%A9ricos_y_el_an%C3%A1lisis_de_la_m%C3%BAsica_popular_cubana_aut%C3%B3ctona&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cita| ''Autochthonous Cuban popular music is indeed similar to a macroorganism in which all its components descend from a common origin and are related, in one way or another, through its entire evolutionary process, which is shown as the development of a formal and stylistic primeval prototype; the common ancestor of all posterior generic forms…  
''
''…the Spanish song-dances of sesquiáltera ([[hemiola]]) rhythm were the primeval starting point of the evolutionary process from which numerous Iberic-American autochthonous styles departed. The structure of those songs, which included its couplet-refrain as well as its [[hemiola]] rhythm from African origin, was replicated and modified in the American countries, thus originating diverse regional genres''.}}

From the elaboration and fusion process of the first Spanish song-dances with sesquiáltera rhythm that arrived in Cuba, such as the Sarabanda and Chacona from the 16th century, three main lines of generic evolution originated, which may be classified as follows:

1 – The "song-dances", which include in chronological order: the [[Punto cubano]] and Zapateo, The Cuban [[Guaracha]], the Rural [[Rumba]], and the Urban [[Rumba]],&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Ruidíaz, Armando: El origen de la música cubana: Mitos y Realidades, 2015: https://www.academia.edu/4832395/El_origen_de_la_m%C3%BAsica_cubana._Mitos_y_realidades&lt;/ref&gt; the popular [[conga]], the [[son (music)|son]], the [[mambo (music)|mambo]], the [[songo music|songo]] and the [[timba]].
 
2 – The "dance-songs", comprised by genres such as the Cuban [[Contradanza]] and [[Danza]], the [[Danzón]], the [[Danzonete]], the [[Danzón-mambo]] and the [[Cha-cha-chá (music)]].

3 – The "songs", composed of the [[Habanera (music)|Habanera]], the Cuban [[Bolero]], the [[Guajira (music)|Guajira]], the Clave, the [[Criolla]], the Tango-congo, the Salon [[Conga]], the [[Pregón]], and other hybrid genres such as the Guaracha-Son, the Guajira-Son, the Bolero-Son, the Lamento-Son, the Criolla-Bolero, the Bolero-Danzón, the Canción-Habanera and the Canción-Bolero.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Ruidíaz, Armando: La metodología de los "Complejos Genéricos" y el análisis de la música popular cubana autóctona, 2017: https://www.academia.edu/31616832/La_metodolog%C3%ADa_de_los_Complejos_Gen%C3%A9ricos_y_el_an%C3%A1lisis_de_la_m%C3%BAsica_popular_cubana_aut%C3%B3ctona&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cuban folk genres ==

According to its encyclopedic definition, the term [[folk music]] (that derives from the German word "folk" or people in English) serves to designate the music spontaneously created and preserved by the people of a country, in contrast with the terms commercial and [[classical music]], which are related to works generated by trained specialists.

In the case of Cuban music, some of its most popular musical genres may be considered within the boundaries of the previous definition. The first Cuban popular music genres that emerged to the public awareness at the beginning of the 19th century, known as [[Punto cubano]] and Zapateo,&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Ruidíaz, Armando: El Punto y el Zapateo de Cuba: https://www.academia.edu/31268678/El_Punto_y_el_Zapateo_de_Cuba.&lt;/ref&gt; were created by peasants without any formal musical education; as well as the popular styles of [[Rumba]] Urbana or "de cajón" (wooden boxes) and the [[Cuban Carnival]] [[Conga (music)]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Ruidíaz, Armando: The origin of Cuban music. Myths and facts. https://www.academia.edu/8041795/The_origin_of_Cuban_music._Myths_and_Facts&lt;/ref&gt;

Also the Cuban [[Guaracha]] was considered to be a product of the common people from Havana, in a similar way as the Rural Rumbas and other ancestors of the [[Son cubano]] (such as [[Changüí]] from [[Guantánamo]] and the Sucu-sucu in Isla de Pinos) were considered to be. The [[Son cubano]] itself was born from a synthesis of different popular styles such as the [[Rumba]] Urbana and [[Rumba]] Rural, and performed until the 1930s by amateur musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Ruidíaz, Armando: The origin of Cuban music. Myths and facts. https://www.academia.edu/8041795/The_origin_of_Cuban_music._Myths_and_Facts&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Cuban folk music style emerged between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th in the poor neighborhoods of [[Havana]]. It was called Clave upon the name of the instrument utilized to accompany it, the Cuban [[Claves]]. This style was sung by popular choirs mostly integrated by colored people, called "Coros de Clave", and its rhythm was the vertical [[hemiola]], also utilized in the ternary Cuban [[Contradanza]].&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio: Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, U.K., 2004, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:3 over 2.png|thumb|center|220px|Vertical hemiola. {{audio|3 over 2.mid|Play}}]]

==Instruments==

Cuba also has produced a wealth of [[folk music]]al instruments. Among the most important ones we should mention the [[Claves]], the [[Bongo drum]] and the [[Conga]], derived from original African instruments; as well as the [[Tres (instrument)|Tres]], a descendant of the Spanish [[Laúd]]. There are also others less well known [[folk instrument]]s such as the Tingo-Talango or [[Tumbandera]] ([[Ground bow]]), the [[Botija]] and the [[Marímbula]], a sort of African [[Mbira]].

==Musicians==

Some well known Cuban folk music artists are: Punto singer [[Celina González]], trovadores [[Sindo Garay]] and [[María Teresa Vera]] as well as soneros [[Ignacio Piñeiro]], Máximo Francisco Repilado Muñoz Telles ([[Compay Segundo]]), [[Ibrahim Ferrer]] and [[Rubén González (pianist)|Rubén Gonzalez]].

'''''Dracula 2: The Last Sanctuary''''' (originally released as '''''Dracula: The Last Sanctuary''''') is a 2000 [[Adventure game#Point-and-click adventure games|point-and-click adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[MC2 France#Wanadoo Edition|Wanadoo]] and jointly published by [[MC2 France#Index+|Index+]], [[Orange S.A.|France Telecom Multimedia]], [[Canal+ Group|Canal+ Multimedia]] and [[Cryo Interactive]]. Originally released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS]], it was ported to the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 2002. In 2012, a slightly modified version developed and published by [[Microïds]] was released for [[iOS]] and [[OS X]], and, in 2013, for [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. In 2014, the remade iOS/OS X/Android version was made available on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dracula.microids.com/data/cp/450/pr-steam-dracula-1-2-3-en.pdf | title=Microïds announces the release of the first three games from the Dracula saga on Steam | publisher=[[Microïds]] | date=April 18, 2014 | format=PDF | accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is a direct sequel to ''[[Dracula: Resurrection]]'', which itself is an unofficial sequel to [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''; set seven years after the end of the novel, [[Jonathan Harker]] finds that he must once again do battle with the evil [[Count Dracula]] in an effort to save his wife, [[Mina Harker|Mina]]. A third game, with an unrelated storyline, followed in 2008, ''[[Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon]]''. A loose sequel to ''Path of the Dragon'' was released in a two-part form in 2013; ''[[Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy]]''.

''Dracula: The Last Sanctuary'' was most widely reviewed for the PC, where it received mixed reviews, with critics praising the graphics, but criticising the nature of some of the puzzles. By 2007, the game and its predecessor had reached combined global sales above 1 million units.

==Gameplay==
''Dracula: The Last Sanctuary'' is a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] [[Adventure game#Point-and-click_adventure_games|point-and-click adventure game]], which employs an "empty" [[Head-up display|HUD]]; the player's inventory is accessible through a button press, whilst another button press will bring the player to a screen with options to [[Saved game|save]] their game, quit their game, or load a previously saved game. As such, the entire screen depicts only direct [[gameplay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dracula: The Last Sanctuary PC Instruction Manual | url=http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.5036 | chapter=Main menu screen | publisher=[[DreamCatcher Interactive]] | year=2000 | page=4 | accessdate=February 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game uses a basic point-and-click interface to move the player around and manipulate the game world. Within each static screen, the player is free to look around 360 degrees. As the player moves the [[Cursor (user interface)|cursor]] around the screen it can change into different styles depending on the situation; neutral cursor (no interaction is possible), an arrow (the player can move in the direction indicated), an arrow within a red circle (access temporarily blocked) a hand (the player can take the object), a magnifying glass (an area which can be examined in more detail), a backwards arrow (the player can move backwards from an area with which they have examined via the magnifying glass), a cog (the player must use an inventory item to initiate interaction with the object), a cog with a hand (the player can operate the object without using an inventory item), an object within a red circle (use of the item temporarily prohibited).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dracula: The Last Sanctuary PC Instruction Manual | url=http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.5036 | chapter=Controls for exploration and action | publisher=[[DreamCatcher Interactive]] | year=2000 | page=5 | accessdate=February 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most often encountered symbol in the game is the cog. When the player encounters this symbol, they must enter their inventory and select an item. If it is the correct item to operate the object, the item will appear in a green circle, replacing the cog icon. If it is the incorrect item, the cog icon will remain.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2001/03/15/dracula-the-last-sanctuary | title=Dracula: The Last Sanctuary (PC) Review | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=March 14, 2001 | last=Butts | first=Steve | accessdate=September 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dracula Last Sanctuary gameplay.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Harker faces one of Dracula's creatures in combat mode. Note the time meter along the top of the screen. If the player fails to act fast enough, the creature will stare the player down, prompting a "Game Over" screen.]]
The game introduces two new elements not found in ''Dracula: Resurrection''; rudimentary combat and combining inventory items. Combat mode replaces the cursor with a [[reticle]], and occurs infrequently, involving either a [[revolver]] or a [[crossbow]]. It is usually (but not always) timed, and often requires the player to perform a particular action, such as hitting the enemy in a specific spot to achieve victory. If they fail to do so within the designated time, the player will die.&lt;ref name="ACG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/201/ | title=Dracula: The Last Sanctuary (PC) Review | publisher=[[Adventure Classic Gaming]] | last=Howe | first=Zack | date=June 15, 2006 | accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to combining inventory items, unlike in the first game, the inventory screen is divided into two - a full circle, and a small semi-circle on the outer edge of the screen. Items placed within the semi-circle cannot be used directly in the game itself, but must be combined by the player with items placed within the full circle. For example, the player's gun is in the full circle, but their bullets are placed within the semi circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dracula: The Last Sanctuary PC Instruction Manual | url=http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.5036 | chapter=The dynamic inventory | publisher=[[DreamCatcher Interactive]] | year=2000 | page=6 | accessdate=February 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 [[iOS]] version adds several new features to the game, such as an optional help feature (which highlights interactive zones on each screen), a "quick inventory" (which allows the player to hold one item and access it without having to enter the inventory screen), an [[autosave]] feature, and a "Compass Look" feature (which utilises the [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic]]-based iDevice [[accelerometer]] controls to mimic looking around in the 360 degree environment).&lt;ref name="iOS"/&gt;

==Plot==
{{See also|Dracula#Plot summary|Dracula: Resurrection#Plot}}

The game opens with the final scene from ''Dracula: Resurrection''; [[Jonathan Harker]] (voiced by [[David Gasman]]) rescuing his wife [[Mina Harker|Mina]] ([[Gay Marshall]]) from [[Count Dracula|Dracula's]] castle and vowing to defeat the Count upon returning to London. Harker has come to realise Dracula called Mina to [[Transylvania]] precisely so Harker would follow her. Upon arriving in the [[Tihuța Pass|Borgo Pass]], Dracula knew Harker would uncover the Dragon Ring, which Dracula himself could not do as it had been placed under the protection of [[Saint George]]. Harker then brought the ring to the castle just as Dracula had planned. Once Harker arrived in the castle, Dracula had instructed his [[Brides of Dracula|brides]] to kill him and take the ring, but Harker had been able to rescue Mina and escape, with the ring still in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dracula: The Last Sanctuary PC Instruction Manual | url=http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.5036 | chapter=Introduction | publisher=[[DreamCatcher Interactive]] | year=2000 | page=3 | accessdate=February 23, 2016 | quote=London, 20 October 1904. [[Mina Harker|Mina]] has just dozed off at last! Our long return voyage to England gives me the opportunity to come to terms with this whole sorry adventure. [[Count Dracula|Dracula]]'s plan was truly diabolical. He first ensured that Mina followed him to [[Transylvania]], knowing full well that I would set off immediately to find her. If his plan had worked, Dracula would have won on all counts: he would have regained possession of Mina and before long, she would have become his queen; he tortured me psychologically by delaying my arrival at the castle; me, who had dared to stand in his way seven long years before. But far worse than that, once I was within his lair, he had his [[Brides of Dracula|female vampires]] try to eliminate me in order to recapture the symbol of hid devilish power: the Dragon's Ring. This ring had been placed under the protection of [[Saint George]], and Dracula used me to remove it from its holy hiding place because he knew he was not able to do it himself. He went to great lengths to ensure that I came across it on my way, so that I would take it and being it with me to the castle. It had all been planned right from the start, except, of course, our escape.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the game begins, Harker has left the Dragon Ring with [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]] ([[Paul Barrett (actor)|Paul Barrett]]), and has gone to Dracula's former London home, Carfax Abbey, to search for clues. Inside, he is attacked by several [[bat]]-like humanoids. He manages to destroy them, and heads to Seward's [[Psychiatric hospital|insane asylum]]. Seward tells Harker that Dracula has purchased a [[Movie theater|cinema]] in London called The Styx. He also informs him that his research has led him to conclude part of the Dragon Ring is missing - a [[diamond]] at its centre which is said to counteract the [[evil]] of the outer ring. In an effort to determine how to proceed against Dracula, Seward puts Mina under [[hypnosis]] and she describes the nearby Highgate Cemetery. Harker heads to the cemetery, where he see Dracula entering a secret tomb. He attempts to follow, but a light is omitted from some nearby stone [[gargoyle]]s, and he is knocked out.

He wakes up the next day and heads back to the asylum to find Mina and Seward have been taken by Dracula. In Seward's safe, he finds the Dragon Ring and correspondence between Seward and a colleague, who had found a 15th-century book which details the rivalry between [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Tepes]] and his younger brother [[Radu cel Frumos|Radu]]. When their father, [[Vlad II Dracul|Dracul]], died, he left the Dragon Ring to Radu on the advice of his [[Ceremonial magic|magician]], Dorko. Tepes was furious and locked Radu in his castle, banished Dorko to the [[dungeon]]s, and split the ring in two, hiding the diamond and keeping the outer ring for himself. Tepes then had a [[Heresy|heretical]] monk, Thadeus, build a "Last Sanctuary" deep within the castle, to which he could retreat in times of crisis. For safe keeping, Harker gives the Dragon Ring to Hopkins ([[Steve Gadler]]), a patient in the asylum who was under the influence of Dracula, but who has fallen in love with Mina, and is willing to help Harker save her.

Harker heads to The Styx, but is gassed. He awakens in Dracula's bedroom in Transylvania. Dracula ([[Allan Wenger]]) tells him he will spare his life if Harker reveals where the Dragon Ring is, but Harker refuses. Dracula leaves, promising Harker a slow death. Shortly thereafter, Hopkins arrives and releases Harker. When he leaves the room, he realises he is still in The Styx; the room was a set made to look like Dracula's room. As he explores, he encounters Seward, who is turning into a [[vampire]]. Seward tells Harker he must destroy Carfax, whilst he himself will destroy The Styx, leaving Dracula nowhere to hide in London. Harker leaves, and Seward blows up The Styx, killing himself before he turns into a vampire.

Harker sets fire to Carfax and heads to Highgate, where he finds a note from Hopkins telling him how to access Dracula's tomb. With the note is the Dragon Ring. Harker enters the tomb and encounters Dracula, who tells him he is returning to Transylvania with Mina. Harker gives chase, using the [[Shaft mining|mines]] to enter the castle. Underneath the castle, he finds an ancient [[prison]] in which he finds Radu's diamond. In the dungeons, he once again encounters Dorko ([[Gay Marshall]]), who tells him her previous betrayal of him failed to earn her Dracula's trust. He shows her the diamond, and she tells him she can reassemble the Dragon Ring, but before she does so she is stabbed by one of Dracula's brides. As she dies, she tells Harker he must restore the ring and defeat Dracula. Harker works his way through the traps in the castle, eventually taking a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] to Dracula's [[keep]].

Upon arriving, a gypsy attacks Harker, but Hopkins appears and sacrifices himself to save him. As he dies, Hopkins gives Harker the key to the Last Sanctuary. Harker explores further, killing Dracula's remaining gypsies, and eventually entering the sanctuary itself, but he is taken prisoner by Dracula's brides. They bring him to Dracula, who tells him Mina is now his forever. Harker appeals to Mina, reminding her they are married in the eyes of [[God]], but she says she cannot remember. He shows her their wedding ring, and she regains her memories. A furious Dracula says both she and Harker must die, but Harker combines Radu's diamond with the Dragon Ring, and Dracula is engulfed in light as the castle begins to crumble. Dracula's brides are crushed by falling debris, and Dracula himself is killed when he is impaled by a statue of Saint George. As the castle ceases collapsing, Harker embraces Mina.

[[Adventure Classic Gaming]]'s Zack Howe scored the game 4 out of 5, praising the [[Video game graphics|graphics]]; "As with its predecessor, [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] graphics are solely used for [[cutscene]]s and are truly a sight to behold. [...] All of the [[3D modeling|3D characters]] are amazingly detailed. Their faces are expressive and their eyes subtly capture the different personalities." Although he was critical of the "[[pixel]]-hunting" nature of some of the [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]], he concluded "''Dracula: The Last Sanctuary'' is definitely a much better game than ''Dracula: Resurrection.'' I recommend this game to any adventure fan without reservation. The excellent production values and thoughtful gameplay makes this game a worthy sequel for the series."&lt;ref name="ACG"/&gt;

[[IGN]]'s Steve Butts scored it 7.8 out of 10. He too praised the graphics, saying "Just using flat backgrounds, the game [[Rendering (computer graphics)|renders]] the illusion of a full [[3D computer graphics|3D environment]] better than any game I've seen yet. Even better, the game looked (and ran) just as well on a simple 333[[Hertz|MHz]] with a [[Voodoo2]] as it did on a 600MHz with a [[Voodoo 5]]." He too was somewhat critical of some of the puzzles, but concluded "Although some of the situations are kind of a stretch, the story is well done and interesting in its own right. Hell, even the parts that threaten your suspension of disbelief are kind of cool."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

[[Adventure Gamers]]' Christina Gmiterko scored it 3 out of 5, praising the graphics and calling them "its strongest selling point." However, she was critical of the core gameplay; "I spent a lot of the game waving my cursor across the screen to find a hot spot where an inventory item needed to be used. Once I found it I would just try combining every inventory item I had with the obstacle at hand until I found the one that worked because more often than not it wasn't reasonably obvious what item you should be using or why you should be using it. By the time I reached the end I felt like I had seen the inventory screen almost as much as I had the actual game."&lt;ref name="AdvGamers"/&gt;

[[GameSpot]]'s Ron Dulin scored it 5.5 out of 10. He criticised the game for having "huge lapses in logic, no atmosphere, and very little in the way of respect for [[Bram Stoker]]'s original story." He was critical of the lack of [[Horror fiction|horror]] in the game; "''Dracula: The Last Sanctuary'' doesn't even manage to maintain a slightly creepy atmosphere. The opening would lead you to believe otherwise, because of its creepy music that sets the stage for a terrifying adventure. Unfortunately, this music is all but absent from the game afterward. The [[voice acting]] doesn't help: The confused-sounding actors ham it up like they're auditioning for a part in [[Mark Borchardt]]'s ''[[Coven (film)|Coven]]''." He concluded "The puzzles will be enough for those who are content with being limited to the challenge of finding a way past locked doors and blocked passageways. But great games transcend their genre's limitations, while good games work within them. Mediocre games, like ''Dracula: The Last Sanctuary'', only serve to remind us of why such things are limitations in the first place."&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt;

'''Elbow grease''' is an [[idiom]] for working hard at [[manual labour]]. It is a [[figure of speech]] for humorously indicating nothing else but manual work is required.

It is sometimes reported in the form of a [[snipe hunt]], a prank where an apprentice or recruit is sent on an errand to retrieve "elbow grease" by his supervisor.

== In popular culture ==

* The prank was used in the web series ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'' where two of the [[List of Red vs. Blue characters#Red Team|Red]] soldiers tell [[List of Red vs. Blue characters#Donut|their new recruit]] to go fetch "elbow grease and headlight fluid" from the store. Their prank backfires when the recruit instead asks for the enemy's flag from [[List of Red vs. Blue characters#Caboose|the enemy's recruit]], mistaking the other base for the store.
* [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]'s advertisement for their heavy duty vans and trucks shows a few men failing to move a small boulder. Frustrated and defeated, at once a GMC van backs onto the scene with the surprise of the men upon discovering several large barrels of elbow grease in the rear of the van.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
According to a review by [[CNN Philippines]], ''Encantadia'' lived up to its long-gestating hype. The introduction and the narration was a big step-up for the show compared to the first one.&lt;ref name="CNNReview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manlangit|first1=Shinji|title=Review: ‘Encantadia’ returns|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/life/entertainment/television/2016/07/19/encantadia-requel-review.html|accessdate=September 7, 2016|agency=CNN Philippines|issue=Entertainment|publisher=CNN Philippines|date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It further stated that the new iteration looks better than the original and paces itself well in terms of narrative and plot.&lt;ref name="CNNReview" /&gt; CNN was also impressed with the fight scenes giving impressions that are being done on a grander scale.&lt;ref name="CNNReview" /&gt; They also stated that the scenes have depth and CG backgrounds are rendered beautifully and looks a lot slicker and a whole lot darker, looking like something from the PC version of [[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim|Skyrim]] which they expressed as a huge improvement after over a decade.&lt;ref name="CNNReview" /&gt; Anthea Reyes of WheninManila.com was also impressed of the series stating: "...all of our childish fantasies have returned to primetime television and it’s come back bigger, better, and infinitely more awesome..."&lt;ref name="wheninmanila"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reyes|first1=Anthea|title=WhenInManila.com Reviews the New Encantadia: Behold the Upgrades|url=http://www.wheninmanila.com/wheninmanila-com-reviews-the-new-encantadia-behold-the-upgrades/|website=When In Manila|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also stated that "the writing team is using this opportunity to the fullest to solidify the myth, the plot holes, and the motivations of everything. The writers of the show were able to place meaning in an aesthetic choice made from way before and further enrich the story."&lt;ref name="wheninmanila" /&gt; She also noted that the details of characters costume, to the clarified presence of the nomadic soldiers post Sappiro-Hathoria war, up until the background music used per every shot were all world class.&lt;ref name="wheninmanila" /&gt; [[FHM Philippines]] also made a review of the show and states that the creators of the show made an effort to make a living and breathing world and they succeeded.&lt;ref name="FHMreview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dela Cruz|first1=Rey|title=5 Things We Like About The New Encantadia|url=http://www.fhm.com.ph/lifestyle/entertainment/encantadia-2016-review-a387-20160719-lfrm2|website=FHM Philippines|publisher=FHM Philippines|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also imposed that even though it was heavily inspired by Hollywood fantasy movies, it has the FIlipino flavor adding its own twist.&lt;ref name="FHMreview" /&gt; They also pointed out that one of the shows strengths is that it has its own unique story. FHM further stated that: "...Like the original that came 11 years before it, Encantadia gives audiences something new to watch when it comes to primetime programming. Finally, something to cleanse our palate from all the drama and romantic programs that we've grown accustomed to."&lt;ref name="FHMreview" /&gt;

A review by ''[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]'' stated that the show’s director of photography and cameramen were impressive for utilizing different creative camera angles and techniques as it contributed to the intensity and excitement in the scene.&lt;ref name="PEPreview1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anarcon|first1=James Patrick|title=Encantadia 2016 SNEAK PEEK: Five highlights to look forward to in pilot episode|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/24058/five-highlights-to-look-forward-to-in-emencantadiaems-pilot-episode|website=PEP.ph|publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also gave positive feedback to its musical scoring stating that "...One of the factors that contributed to Encantadia 2005’s success is its musical scoring, in fact, it was even commended in the Asian Television Awards for Best Original Music Score. This requel did not disappoint when it comes to this aspect. The musical scorer seemed to compose different pieces suited to each kingdom since each had its own theme[...]the modernized, upbeat version of "Tadhana" also inensified the fight scenes."&lt;ref name="PEPreview1" /&gt;

Because of the good ratings and the success of the show, ''Encantadia'' is slated or expected to have another season. This was hinted on few scenes in its finale showing Cassiopea's twin,  who lives in the ice kingdom in the far northern part of Encantadia, seems to pose a threat to diwatas. This was attested further by an Instagram post of Director Mark Reyes that the finale episode is his "official statement".

===Ratings===
According to [[AGB Nielsen Philippines]]' Mega Manila household television ratings, the pilot episode of ''Encantadia'' earned a 26.1% rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AGB: 10 Top-rating Pilot and Finale Primetime episodes in 2016 |author=Ching, Mark Angelo |date=January 1, 2017 |url=https://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/25257/agb-10-top-rating-pilot-and-finale-primetime-episodes-in-2016 |accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the final episode scored a 13.8% rating in Nationwide Urban Television Audience Measurement people in television homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=May 19 (Fri) TV Ratings / AGB Nielsen / NUTAM People in TV Homes (Evening). |url=http://www.pep.ph/news/pepalerts/read/20477}} Retrieved 2017-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous Players Canadian Corporation dates back to the early days of [[Famous Players Film Company]] (later [[Paramount Pictures]]), founded in 1912, as its earliest predecessor, though that company did not have any operations in Canada until 1920, when it bought [[Nathan Nathanson]]'s Paramount Theatre chain, which Nathanson had established four years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cineplex.com/News/Cineplex-Celebrates-100-Years-of-Movie-Memories.aspx|title=Cineplex Celebrates 100 Years of Movie Memories|author=Cineplex Entertainment|date=2012-01-18|accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The Canadian "Paramount Theatre" chain was not affiliated with the American chain with the same name.&lt;/ref&gt; Nathanson, along with being the 5th richest person in the world, became the first president of the resulting entity, '''Famous Players Canadian Corporation Limited'''.&lt;ref name="nathanson"&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.filmstudies.ca/journal/pdf/cj-film-studies122_Moore_Nathanson_g.pdf| format = PDF| title = Nathan L.

Some of the most high-profile and popular theatres in the Famous Players chain were the [[Ed Mirvish Theatre|Imperial]] and the [[Uptown Theatre (Toronto)|Uptown]] in [[Toronto]]; and the Capitol, [[Orpheum, Vancouver|Orpheum]], [[Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage|Stanley]], and Strand in [[Vancouver]].

Originally began with 13 theatres located in Ontario and British Columbia, the company quickly expanded its holdings to 100 by the end of 1926. Until the 1950s, the company continued to build its operations in the movie theatre sector.

In 1952, however, Famous Players began to invest in the new technology. First, the company purchased the rights to a [[coinbox]] system that connected to television sets. A year later, it purchased its first broadcasting assets, [[CKCO-TV]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario]] and [[CFCM-TV]] in Québec City.

At the end of the 1950s, the company acquired the first of many cable TV companies it would come to own, thus adding control over the distribution of its TV product. As the industry grew, starting in the mid-1960s, so did the assets of Famous Players in this segment. In 1971, the company sold off the majority of its shareholdings in its movie theatre and other non-TV-related entertainment holdings to [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf + Western Canada]] and subsequently changed its name to '''Canadian Cablesystems Limited''', reflecting the new focus of its operations. Canadian Cablesystems was the owner and operator of '''Metro Cable''', which served parts of [[Metro Toronto]], as well as a minority shareholder in several other cable companies, until it was purchased by [[Rogers Communications|Rogers Cablesystems Ltd.]] (founded by [[Edward Rogers III|Ted Rogers]]) in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;"Rogers defends its bid to buy Canadian Cablesystems". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', September 13, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most famously, Famous Players Theatres allowed the lease on a property containing the entrance of one of its flagship [[Toronto]] locations, the Imperial Six, to lapse in 1986. Cineplex immediately took over the lease, denying Famous Players Theatres access to the portion of the property that they already owned outright. Famous Players eventually sold its property to Cineplex Odeon Cinemas, on the condition it never again be used to show filmed entertainment.  Cineplex's live-theatre division renovated the theatre; renamed the [[Canon Theatre|Pantages Theatre]], it hosted ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' for ten years.  The theatre was renamed the Canon in 2001 and then again in 2011 as the [[Ed Mirvish Theatre]], which it is currently known, in honour of the popular businessman and ironically Mr. Drabinsky's main competitor in live theatre in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/1097583--canon-theatre-renamed-in-honour-of-ed-mirvish Canon Theatre renamed in honour of Ed Mirvish | Toronto Star]. Thestar.com (2011-12-06). Retrieved on 2013-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous Players expanded throughout the 1990s. Under chairman [[John Bailey (businessman)|John Bailey]], Famous Players re-built its infrastructure from 1997 to 2003 with new "megaplex" theatre brands featuring [[stadium seating]], such as SilverCity and Coliseum, with food courts and video games. Around that time, [[AMC Theatres]] entered the Canadian market, and most of the traditional ties between the existing chains and the major studios began to unwind, putting all three chains in full-on competition in several major markets.

The company once operated a number of drive-in theatres, but most have been closed and replaced with modern theatres. Until 2004, it operated theatres in the [[Maritimes]], none of which were branded-concept theatres; these were sold to the region's dominant exhibitor, [[Empire Theatres]].

In June 2005, Viacom announced it would sell Famous Players to Cineplex Galaxy, controlled by [[Onex Corporation]] for [[Canadian dollar|$]]500 million (about [[United States dollar|US$]]397 million). This deal was completed on July 22, 2005. To satisfy antitrust concerns, on August 22, 2005 the group announced the sale of 27 locations in [[Ontario]] and [[western Canada]] to [[Empire Theatres]].

Prior to merging with Cineplex, Famous Players operated five theatre brands: '''Famous Players''', '''SilverCity''', '''Coliseum''', '''Colossus''' and '''Paramount'''. Of these, Cineplex only preserved the first two brands. The Coliseum and Colossus theatres sold to Cineplex were renamed to Cineplex Cinemas, though the unique features of the original brands were preserved. Similarly, Paramount theatres now use the [[Scotiabank Theatre]] brand since 2007.

'''''Feltner v. [[Columbia Pictures Television]], Inc.''''', 523 U.S. 340 (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc.|volume=523|page=340|pin=|year=1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that if there is to be an award of statutory damages in a copyright infringement case, then the opposing party has the right to demand a jury trial.

==Background==
C. Elvin Feltner, Jr., and the corporation he owns, Krypton International Corporation, operate 3 television stations which ran various television shows licensed from Columbia Pictures, including ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'', ''[[Silver Spoons]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'', and ''[[T. J. Hooker]]''.  After becoming delinquent in royalty payments, and being unable to resolve the impasse over the debt owed, Columbia revoked their license to run the shows.  The stations kept running them anyway.  Columbia sued Feltner, Krypton and some subsidiaries and executives of the corporation.  The trial court found the infringement to be wilful, and denied Feltner's request for a jury trial on statutory damages.  The court found every broadcast of every episode run on every television station to be a separate infringement, awarded the statutory maximum of $20,000 for each of the 440 acts, for a total of $8,800,000 in damages.

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] upheld the award.

==Opinion==
The Supreme Court examined the statute in an attempt to resolve the issue without reaching constitutional issues. It found that there is no provision in the statute for a jury trial on the issue of statutory damages, therefore it must look at whether the law triggers the provisions of the requirement for [[Jury trial|trial by jury]] required by the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]. The question then being, were statutory damages in the form of a trial in a court of law, or a trial in a court of equity; if a court of law, then trial by jury may be demanded; if a court of equity, then trial by jury is not available unless provided for by statute. Upon examining long historical practice in copyright infringement cases, it decided that damages in a copyright case have historically been tried as a court of law, and not as a court of equity. Thus, the defendant Feltner was entitled to a jury trial on the issue of the amount of statutory damages.

The judgment was reversed and remanded back to the trial court.

After remand and the jury trial ordered by the Supreme Court, the jury awarded $72,000 in statutory damages for each of the 440 works infringed, for a total award of $31.68 million – over three and a half times the damages awarded by the Judge at the prior bench trial. On his appeal from the $31.68 million jury award to the Ninth Circuit, Feltner argued that the Supreme Court’s rulings (that the Copyright Act provided that statutory damages be awarded by Judges and the Seventh Amendment required that juries award those damaged) rendered statutory damages unconstitutional and void.&lt;ref name=CPIIvKBBI&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. vs. Krypton Broadcasting of Birmingham, Inc. |vol=152 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1171 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=1998 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/152/1171/543823/ |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ninth Circuit rejected this argument and affirmed the $31.68 million jury award.&lt;ref name=CPIIvKBBI/&gt; Feltner’s petition to the Supreme Court to hear the case for a second time was unsuccessful, leaving the $31.68 million award intact.

"'''Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn'''" is a line from the 1939 film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' starring [[Clark Gable]] and [[Vivien Leigh]].  The line is spoken by [[Rhett Butler]] (Gable), as his last words to [[Scarlett O'Hara]] (Leigh), in response to her tearful question: "Where shall I go? What shall I do?"  Scarlett clings to the hope that she can win him back. This line is also partially spoken by Rhett Butler in Margaret Mitchell's novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', published in 1936, from which the film is derived.

The line demonstrates that Rhett has finally given up on Scarlett and their tumultuous relationship. After more than a decade of fruitlessly seeking her love, he no longer cares what happens to her.

This quotation was [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|voted the number one movie line]] of all time by the [[American Film Institute]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 YEARS...100 MOVIE QUOTES|url=http://www.afi.com/100years/quotes.aspx|publisher=American Film Institute|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=21 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production code conflict==
Prior to the film's release, censors objected to the use of the word "damn" in the film, a word that had been prohibited by the 1930 [[Motion Picture Production Code]], beginning in July 1934. However, before 1930 the word "damn" had been relatively common in films. In the silent era, [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] even shouted "Goddamn you!" to the enemy during battle in ''[[The Big Parade]]'' (1925). The Production Code was ratified on March 31, 1930, and was effective for motion pictures whose filming began afterward. Thus, [[Sound film|talkies]] that used "damn" include ''Glorifying the American Girl'' (1929), ''Flight'' (1929), ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' (1929), ''Hell's Angels'' (1930), ''The Big Trail'' (1930), ''The Dawn Patrol'' (1930), ''The Green Goddess'' (1930) and ''Dracula'' (1931). Although legend persists that the Hays Office fined producer David O. Selznick $5,000 for using the word "damn", in fact the MPPDA board passed an amendment to the Production Code a month and a half before the film's release, on November 1, 1939, that allowed use of the words "hell" or "damn" when their use "shall be essential and required for portrayal, in proper historical context, of any scene or dialogue based upon historical fact or folklore...or a quotation from a literary work, provided that no such use shall be permitted which is intrinsically objectionable or offends good taste".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Jon|title=Hollywood V.

It is actually the second use of "damn" in the film. The term "damn Yankees" is heard in the parlor scene at [[Twelve Oaks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=POCOWATCHIT|first1=ROD|title=‘Gone With the Wind’ made history in more ways than one|url=http://www.kansas.com/entertainment/movies-news-reviews/movie-maniac/article3665379.html|accessdate=15 February 2017|work=The Wichita Eagle|date=8 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Good Deeds Day''' is an international day of [[volunteering]]. Beginning in 2007, its mission is to unite people from around the world in doing good deeds for others and the planet.

==Background==

This day of [[community service]] was launched in 2007 in [[Israel]] by businesswoman and [[philanthropist]], [[Shari Arison]], through [[Ruach Tova]], a [[Nonprofit organization]] that connects between people who want to volunteer and organizations in need of assistance.

Speaking about the day, initiator Shari Arison said: 
{{Quote|text= I believe that if people will think good, speak good and do good, the circles of goodness will grow in the world. Good Deeds Day has become the leading day of giving and this year individuals, school children, students, soldiers and employees from many businesses are joining in for the annual Good Deeds Day with the aim of doing a good deed for others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israel21c.org/900000-people-take-part-in-good-deeds-day/ 900,000 people take part in Good Deeds Day (Israel21c)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==

Approximately 7,000 people participated in Israel in 2007. The day became global in 2011, with participants from around the world, including in the USA, [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]]. In 2012, project organizers teamed up with [[MTV]] Global for a six-week-campaign on its online and TV platforms, exposing the message to 24 million viewers around the world. In 2014, [[NASDAQ]] invited Shari Arison to kick off Good Deeds Day in the trading day closing bell ceremony. 2017 marked the fourth year in a row of the NASDAQ and Good Deeds Day collaboration.

Good Deeds Day 2018 will be on Sunday, April 15, 2018.

In 2017, the 11th annual Good Deeds Day, approximately 2,500,000 participants from 93 countries volunteered, marking it the largest and most global day yet. To celebrate, project organizers held mega events in Kenya, Portugal, Italy, Poland and more.

Good Deeds Day and Ruach Tova are part of The [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927194639/http://www.arison.co.il/AFFHome.aspx?Lang=2 Ted Arison Family Foundation], the philanthropic arm of the Arison Group.

==Around the world==

In 2011, international companies [http://en.shikunbinui.co.il/ Shikun &amp; Binui] and [[Bank Hapoalim]] were among the first international participants in Good Deeds Day outside of Israel. As of 2016, Good Deeds Day is celebrated in 75 countries worldwide, and has collaborated with major cities such as Rome, São Paulo, Kaohsiung City, and New York City to create special events. In the Good Deeds Day event at Herald Square, New York City, actor and activist [[Adrian Grenier]] supported the day by speaking at the event:
{{Quote|It’s important to have a day in which we acknowledge wonderful people who are dedicated to doing good.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtlwCohKXqY&amp;&amp;t=58s/ Adrian Grenier speaks in the 2016 Good Deeds Day Event at Herald Square, New York City (Youtube)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Pope Francis]] endorsed the day in his Sunday sermon prior to Good Deeds Day 2015 in Rome and said:
{{Quote|I send my wishes to the numerous groups of volunteers that have united to show solidarity by doing good deeds that promote a better society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shariarison.com/en/content/pope-honors-good-deeds-day/ Pope honors Good Deeds Day (Shari Arison)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2016 Good Deeds Day collaborated with [[Brazil]] based volunteering center Atados on a nationwide activation. Together they reached 10,000 volunteers around the country, and 40 cities across Brazil including major cities like [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brasília]], and [[São Paulo]].

In [[Latin America]], major Good Deeds Day events took place in Panama, Costa Rica, Brazil, Peru, and 16 other countries in the region.

In [[Taiwan]], Good Deeds Day collaborated with TAVE (Taiwan Association for Volunteer Effort) to create major citywide activities in [[Kaohsiung City]], Taiwan in 2016. Taiwan’s Vice President, [[Chen Chien-jen]], and Kaohsiung’s Mayor, [[Chen Chu]], were among the government officials honoring the day in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwanhot.net/?p=81289 (TaiwanHot, in Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taoyuan City]] also hosted citywide activities, arranged by Taoyuan City Volunteer Service Association and other partnering organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nownews.com/n/2016/05/05/2089169 (Now News, in Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest collaborations in [[Europe]] include SPES (Associazione Promozione e Solidarietà) in Italy, who organized a major Good Deeds Day event in Rome in 2016. Good Deeds Day invited runners in the [[Rome Marathon]] to join the “Roma Fun Run” and visit the Good Deeds Day fair of non-profits at the finish line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insiemeperilbenecomune.org/ (Insieme per il bene comune, in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Israel===

Good Deeds Day (Hebrew: יום מעשים טובים) first began in Israel in 2007 with 7,000 participants and grew to 1,500,000 in 2016. Local municipalities, companies, and nonprofit organizations all around the country participate by organizing special activities in their communities, renovating or painting buildings, building community gardens, and volunteering in many other ways for populations in need. Cities such as [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]] also host special Good Deeds Day events that are open to the public, such as the 2016 “Counselor’s Boulevard” that took place on [[Rothschild Boulevard]], Tel Aviv. Professionals gave free counseling sessions to passersby. Other public events include the 2015 Good Deeds Day nonprofit Fair at [[Rabin Square]], Tel Aviv, and [[Ashkelon]], which included hair donation stands, dog adoption area, and a give-and-take market.

'''Henry J. Maar''' (1921–1992), known as "The Sultan of Balloons", was one of the pioneers in balloon twisting. He appeared for over a decade on episodes of the long running [[Bozo the Clown|Bozo's Circus]]. While the origins of balloon twisting is impossible to prove, [[Emmy Award]] winning producer/director Joseph Maar has provided evidence that his father, Henry, may be the founder of balloon twisting.&lt;ref name="Joe"&gt;Maar, Joseph.[http://www.tmyers.com/marr.html The Story of Henry Maar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930075403/http://www.tmyers.com/marr.html |date=2007-09-30 }} TMyers.com 6/20/06 Accessed 10/5/07&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Moss (artist)|Larry Moss]] calls Joseph Maar's evidence "compelling" but warns that if Joseph Maar is correct then the history of balloon twisting would have to be rewritten.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Larry. [http://www.balloonhq.com/column/bhq/jul06/ Evolution of Balloon Entertaining] BalloonHQ. July 2006. Accessed 10/5/07&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 1975 book by "Jolly the Clown" Petri credits "Herman Bonnert from Pennsylvania at a magician's convention in 1939" as being the first balloontwister.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, Ralph. [http://www.balloonhq.com/column/dewey/aug06/ Balloon History] BalloonHQ Column. Accessed 10/5/07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joseph Maar's account==

Joseph Maar is the three time Emmy Award Winning Coordinating Director formerly with ESPN who worked on several shows including "Sports Center", "Sports Century", "Pardon the Interruption", "Around the Horn" and many other shows. He is also a client of some of the largest ballooning stores in the country.&lt;ref name = "Joe" /&gt; His story of his father has been picked up by several sources as the story of the origins of Balloon Twisting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://balloon_animal.totallyexplained.com/ History: The Inventor and History of Balloon Twisting] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130205001800/http://balloon_animal.totallyexplained.com/ |date=2013-02-05 }} Accessed 10/5/07&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joseph Maar, his father had pleurisy as a child and spent several years at a TB Sanitorium in Milwaukee. To develop his lungs, the facility had Henry blow up balloons. In the 1930s Henry became a [[vaudeville]] [[Magic (illusion)|magician]]. While preparing for a show in 1938 or 1939, Joseph writes, "he came back to the car to get the rest of his magic tricks only to find the vehicle had been broken into and everything was gone."&lt;ref name = "Joe" /&gt; With his magic tricks stolen, Maar went on stage and performed a show consisting primarily of balloon twisting. "Afterward, the agents went nuts and told him to forget the magic and to start doing the balloons. That &lt;nowiki&gt;[Henry Maar's agents said]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'everyone's doing regular magic tricks but no one is doing the balloon tricks.'"&lt;ref name = "Joe" /&gt;

Henry spent the next ten years performing under the stage name of "Johnny Ford" and entertaining GI's with the USO. After [[World War II]] an agent offered Maar twice his rate to wear a [[clown]] suit while performing his act. Joseph Maar states "that was the advent of a clown doing balloons."&lt;ref name = "Joe" /&gt; From the late 50s to mid-70s, Joseph and a 1968 article from the Waukegan Sun-Times{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} cites that his father was a regular on "Bozo's Circus" and other children's shows. Two of these episodes reside with BalloonHQ and in IMDb he is listed in the credits of the March 16, 1977 episode of "Bozo's Circus."&lt;ref&gt;[http://imdb.com/title/tt0805092/ Bozo's Circus] and [http://imdb.com/title/tt0254011/ Bozo's Circus]&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Maar also credits his father with inventing 'face painting.'  According to Joseph, his father would sometimes have trouble with his makeup during long summertime events. To cover his own need to touch up his clown make up, he would invite kids up on stage where Henry Maar would "make them up" like a clown.&lt;ref name="Joe" /&gt;

==Other origin stories==

While Joseph Maar's story has been accepted as "compelling," it is not viewed as conclusive. Other twisters have been credited with being the originator of balloon twisting. They include:

*Val Andrews, in ''Manual of Balloon Modeling, Vol. 1, An Encyclopedic Series'', credits H.J. Bonnert of Scranton, PA as being the "daddy of them all."&lt;ref name = "history"&gt;Andrew, Val. ''Manual of Balloon Modeling, Vol. 1, An Encyclopedic Series'' 1981, Magico Magazine, NYC quoted on [http://www.balloonhq.com/faq/history.html Balloon History] BalloonHQ. Accessed 10/5/07&lt;/ref&gt;
*John Shirley, in the preface to ''One balloon animals; the rubber jungle / Roger's rubber jungle'' by Roger Siegel, writes "probably began sometime around 1920 but did not become popular until the advent of the skinny balloons after World War II...The inventor of the one balloon animal is unknown, but his origination opened the door to a new art." &lt;ref name = "history" /&gt;
*Jim Church III writes, " Frank Zacone from Youngstown, Ohio was doing a balloon act during the 1940s and had been doing the act for some time."&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt;

A value of 100 IRE was originally defined to be the range from blanking level to peak white in a video signal. A value of 0 IRE corresponds to the voltage value of the signal during the blanking period. The sync pulse is normally 40 IRE below this 0 IRE value, so the total range covered from peak to trough of an all white signal would be 140 IRE. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that video signals use the "IRE" unit instead of DC voltages to describe levels and amplitudes. Based on a standard 1 V&lt;sub&gt;pp&lt;/sub&gt; NTSC composite-video signal that swings from -286 mV (sync tip) to +714 mV (peak video), a 140 IRE peak-to-peak convention has been established. One NTSC IRE unit is 7.14mV, where -40 IRE is equivalent to -286 mV, and +100 IRE is equivalent to +714 mV. Note that 0 IRE is equivalent to 0 V. The Black Level is equivalent to 53.57 mV (7.5 IRE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/373389B-01/nivms/signals_cvbs/|title=Composite Video Signals (CVBS)|last=|first=|date=|website=National Instruments|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=31 May 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAL video signal is slightly different in that it swings from -300 mV to +700 mV, instead. Thus, one PAL IRE unit is 7mV, where -43 IRE is equivalent to -300 mV at the sync tip, and +100 IRE is equivalent to +700 mV at the peak video level. Black level is the same as the blanking level 0 mv (0 IRE) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The reason IRE is a relative measurement (percent) is because a video signal may be any amplitude.

'''''I Am the Cheese''''' is a [[young adult fiction|young adult]] novel by the [[American people|American]] writer [[Robert Cormier]], published in 1977.

==Plot==

The novel opens with [[protagonist]] Adam Farmer biking from his home in the fictional town of Monument, [[Massachusetts]] (based on Cormier's home town of [[Leominster, Massachusetts]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}) to visit his father in Rutterburg, Vermont. The story [[parallel plot|alternates]] with transcripts of [[audiocassette|tapes]] between a "subject" and Brint. The subject receives [[psychotherapy]] and is interrogated by Brint.

As the book continues, it is revealed that Adam is the subject, who was formerly Paul Delmonte of a small New York town. His father, "David Farmer", was a newspaper reporter who was enrolled in the [[Witness Protection Program]] (WPP).  The family moved to Monument and escaped several close calls with their identities, but the parents are killed in the penultimate chapter in a car collision. Adam/Paul survives, and is taken to a government [[mental asylum]]. The last chapter implies that WPP agents killed the family, and reveals that Paul is regularly interrogated on the topic. Each time, Paul is unable to handle his realizations of his past and embarks on his delusion bike ride across the ground of the facility. At the end of the last tape, Brint recommends authorization to kill Adam.

== Characters ==

* Adam Farmer (Paul Delmonte) – teenage protagonist
* David Farmer (Anthony Delmonte) - Adam's father, an insurance agent and former newspaper man.
* Louise Farmer/Delmonte - Adam's mother
* Amy Hertz - Adam's friend and love interest
* Brint - Adam's questioner and "guide" as his psychotherapist
* Mr. Grey - agent in the [[Witness Protection Program]] 
* Arthur - a fat man in the town of Hookset who tells Adam of Junior Varney
* Dr. Dupont - a friendly doctor in a mental hospital; Adam is his patient
* Junior Varney - a troublemaker and thief in Hookset
* Whipper and friends - bullies in Carver
* Old man by the gas station - warns him about trusting strangers
* The elderly couple - the man helps him out of the ditch, while the women criticizes him

==Title==

This quote is the last verse from "[[The Farmer In The Dell]]", a song that Adam sings during the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The cheese stands alone&lt;br/&gt;
''The cheese stands alone&lt;br/&gt;
''Heigh-ho, the merry-o&lt;br/&gt;
''The cheese stands alone
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
He sings many of these songs throughout the novel. The song contains several characters, each taking someone with them when the farmer leaves, yet the cheese has nobody.

Adam believes that he is the cheese. He is alone in the world, his mother dead and his father missing, and he lives in a hospital. He thinks that he is not wanted anymore. Also, as in other works by Cormier, there is a dual meaning to the title. The words "I am the cheese" may also represent Adam's feelings of entrapment: he is the bait used to lure his parents to their murders.{{Original research inline|date=November 2009}}

Another point is that his father had taught him the song, possibly in a way to reinforce the new name, 'Farmer', they had adopted.

==Literary significance and criticism==

The 1975 novel ''I Am the Cheese'' began Cormier's experimentation with first-person, present-tense narration. When Cormier sent the manuscript to the publisher of his previous novel, ''[[The Chocolate War]]'', he was confused and depressed, convinced that he was alienating his new young adult audience because of the complex and ambiguous story. However, ''I Am the Cheese'' proved to be a success.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2291">'''Intercast''' was a short-lived technology developed in 1996 by [[Intel]] for broadcasting information such as [[web page]]s and computer software, along with a single television channel. It required a compatible [[TV tuner card]] installed in a [[personal computer]] and a decoding program called Intel Intercast Viewer. The data for Intercast was [[wiktionary:embed|embedded]] in the [[Vertical Blanking Interval]] (VBI) of the video signal carrying the Intercast-enabled program.

With Intercast, a computer user could watch the TV broadcast in one [[Window (computing)|window]] of the Intercast Viewer, while being able to view [[HTML]] web pages in another window. Users were also able to download software transmitted via Intercast as well. Most often the web pages received were relevant to the television program being broadcast, such as extra information relating to a television program, or extra news headlines and weather forecasts during a newscast. Intercast can be seen as a more modern version of [[teletext]].

The Intercast Viewer software was bundled with several TV tuner cards at the time, such as the [[Hauppauge Computer Works|Hauppauge]] Win-TV card. Also at the time of Intercast's introduction, [[Compaq]] offered some models of computers with built-in TV tuners installed with the Intercast Viewer software.

Upon its debut, Intercast was used by several TV networks, such as [[NBC]], [[CNN]], [[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]], and [[MTV2|M2]] (now MTV2).

Intel discontinued support for Intercast a couple of years later.

[[NBC]]'s series ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' was a show that was Intercast-enabled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1444">: ''This is an article about a precursor to [[Romania]]n popular theater. For the [[antediluvian]] patriarch, see [[Irad]]''
'''''Irozii''''' (singular ''Irod'') were [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Romanian Orthodox]] [[minstrel show]]s, played in the [[Christmas]] season, centered on the figure of [[Herod the Great]] ({{lang-ro|Irod}}) and the [[Massacre of the Innocents]]. Along with a [[New Year's Day|New Year]] tradition of imitation peasant weddings, they are generally considered the origin of [[theater in Romania|Romanian-language popular theater]]. 

''Irozii'' influenced the [[Purim]] plays of the Romanian [[Jew]]s (generally credited as the origin of [[Yiddish theater]]) and ''vice versa''. Thus, the origin of Romanian-language popular theater in the first half of the 19th century was echoed in the later origin (also in Romania) of Yiddish theater.

Typically performed by schoolteachers and [[deacon]]s, ''irozii'' initially took place in the [[boyar]]'s or lord's court; in later years, performances would be given in the salons of the grand houses. ''Irozii'' began to fade in the late 19th century; elaborate pageants are no longer common, though a less elaborate form continues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1788">The '''John Hour''' refers to the public naming of "[[John (prostitution)|john]]s" (male customers of female [[prostitutes]]).

In October 1979, [[New York City]] mayor [[Ed Koch]] instructed [[WNYC]], the city's public radio station, to read the names of convicted "johns". Koch intended to use this public shaming, swiftly dubbed "The John Hour", as a tool to reduce [[prostitution]].

An uproar ensued. On October 26, the ''[[New York Times]]'' editorialized:

"This week's premiere of Mayor Koch's 'John Hour,' which broadcast the names of nine convicted customers of prostitutes, was a shabby show, in no way redeemed by its brevity. It took only about a minute for city-employed announcers to read the names over city-owned radio and television stations. But it was a mighty misuse of government power."&lt;ref name="nydailynews"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2008/03/16/2008-03-16_out_the_johns_and_bring_on_the_shame.html Out the johns and bring on the shame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After one broadcast, "The John Hour" was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/17/nyregion/17radio.html?ex=1310788800&amp;en=b24c26648654772b&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss WNYC’s Planned Move Will Finish Its Breakup With the City - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, New York governor [[Eliot Spitzer]] was exposed as a customer of a high-priced prostitution ring. In the wake of this scandal, Koch advocated reinstating "The John Hour".&lt;ref name="nydailynews"/&gt;

The '''LKL Slam Dunk Contest''' is an annual [[Lietuvos krepšinio lyga|Lithuanian Basketball League]] (LKL) competition, that was originally held during the [[LKL All-Star Day]], and later during the [[Karaliaus Mindaugo taurė|King Mindaugas Cup]]. The contest has been held almost every year, from the first All-Star Day.

==History==
Throughout the history of the contest, there have been witnessed many famous moments. Most noticeable being the 2001 contest, in [[Kaunas]], where [[Robertas Javtokas]] (representing [[BC Lietuvos rytas|Lietuvos rytas]]) repeated the World Record for the highest slam dunk, when he dunked a basketball on a goal set at 3.65m (12 feet) above the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nuo rekordo iki kuriozo: įsimintiniausi LKL Žvaigždžių dienos dėjimai|url=http://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/49962319/nuo-rekordo-iki-kuriozo-isimintiniausi-lkl-zvaigzdziu-dienos-dejimai|accessdate=18 February 2017|work=alfa.lt|date=4 January 2016|language=Lithuanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first slam dunk contest was won by [[Gary Arrington]], of [[BC Statyba]], at the 1994 [[LKL All-Star Day]], in [[Panevėžys]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramoška|first1=Saulius|title=Rankas smailina tritaškininkai ir dėjikai|url=http://lzinios.lt/lzinios/Sportas/rankas-smailina-tritaskininkai-ir-dejikai/238960|accessdate=18 February 2017|work=Lietuvos žinios|date=18 February 2017|language=Lithuanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current champion of the LKL Dunk Contest is [[Kenny Gaines]].&lt;ref name="2017 konkursas"&gt;{{cite news|title=KMT „Oro karaliumi“ tapo A.Bestą nurungęs 175 cm ūgio G.Žitlinskas |url=http://www.krepsinis.net/naujiena/kmt-oro-karaliumi-tapo-a-besta-nurunges-175-cm-ugio-g-zitlinskas/270931 |accessdate=18 February 2017 |work=Krepsinis.net |date=18 February 2017 |language=Lithuanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=September 2016}}
'''Circus skills''' are a group of pursuits that have been performed as entertainment in [[circus]], [[sideshow]], [[Street performance|busking]], or [[variety show|variety]], [[vaudeville]] or [[music hall]] shows. Most circus skills are still being performed today. Many are also practised by non-performers as a hobby.

[[Circus school]]s and instructors use various systems of categorization to group circus skills by type. Systems that have attempted to formally organize circus skills into pragmatic teaching groupings include the Gurevich system&lt;ref&gt;"The Classification of Circus Techniques" by Hovey Burgess. ''The Drama Review'': TDR, Vol. 18, No. 1, Popular Entertainments (Mar., 1974), pp. 65-70. doi:10.2307/1144863.&lt;/ref&gt; (the basis of the Russian Circus School's curriculum) and the [[List_of_circus_skills#Hovey Burgess system|Hovey Burgess system]].

==Hovey Burgess system==
The '''Hovey Burgess pedagogy''' divides circus skills into three categories, each subdivided into three skill levels.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Category
! Preliminary skills
! Essential skills
! Diversified skills
|-
| '''[[Juggling]]'''
| Balancing objects
| Toss juggling: balls, rings, clubs
| Gyroscopic juggling: [[devil sticks]], [[diabolo]], [[plate spinning]], etc.
|-
| '''[[#Equilibristics|Equilibristics]]'''
| Headstands and hand balancing
| Balancing: on rolling objects ([[unicycle]], [[rola bola]], etc.), on "stilting" objects ([[stilt walking|stilts]], freestanding ladder, etc.) and human columns.
| Rigging: [[trapeze]], [[horizontal bar]], [[slackwire]], [[tightrope walking|tight wire]], etc.
|-
| '''Vaulting'''
| Jumping
| Turning the body along its long, medium and short axes
| Catapults
|}

Hovey Burgess has been known to compare his system to [[Newton's third law]] (i.e., "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction").  Vaulting is concerned with action; juggling is concerned with reaction; equilibrium is the intersection of action and reaction.

==Equilibristics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014|reason=Proof is needed that this is a term that is actually used.}}
Circus skills which involve balancing or maintaining [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The term applies equally to acts in which the performer balances on a piece of equipment or a prop, and acts in which the performer balances a prop on a part of their body.

[[Robot]]s and [[Android (robot)|androids]] have frequently been depicted or described in works of fiction. The word "robot" itself comes from a work of fiction, [[Karel Čapek]]'s play, ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'', written in 1920 and first performed in 1921.

This '''list of fictional robots and androids''' is chronological, and categorised by medium. It includes all depictions of robots, androids and [[gynoid]]s in literature, television, and cinema; however, robots that have appeared in more than one form of media are not necessarily listed in each of those media. This list is intended for all fictional computers which are described as existing in a humanlike or mobile form. It shows how the concept has developed in the human imagination through history.

Static computers depicted in fiction are discussed in the separate [[list of fictional computers]].

==Theatre==
{{For|robots produced for entertainment in the eighteenth century|Automaton#Modern automata}}
* '''''[[Coppélia]]''''', a life-size dancing doll in the ballet of the same name, choreographed by [[Marius Petipa]] with music by [[Léo Delibes]] (1870)
* The word "robot" comes from [[Karel Čapek]]'s play, ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'' written in 1920 in the [[Czech language]] and first performed 1921. Performed in New York 1922 and an English edition published in 1923. In the play, the word refers to [[Artificial life|artificially created life]] forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/01/0125robot-cometh-capek-rur-debut/|title=Jan. 25, 1921: Robots First Czech In|last=Long|first=Tony|work=[[Wired.com]]|date=2011-01-25|accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named robots in the play are '''Marius''', '''Sulla''', '''Radius''', '''Primus''', '''Helena''', and '''Damon'''. The play introduced and popularized the term "robot". Čapek's robots are biological machines that are assembled, as opposed to grown or born.

* '''Bot Best Friend''', a commercially sold robot with five different "friendship modes" from the [[Smosh]] video ''Awesome New Robot''!

* '''[[List of characters in Red vs. Blue#Lopez|Lopez]], [[Church (Red vs. Blue)|Church]]''' and '''[[Tex (Red vs. Blue)|Tex]]''', characters from the [[Rooster Teeth]] machinima ''[[Red vs. Blue]]''. Only Lopez is a true artificial life-form, as both Church and Tex exist only as ghosts ( later in the series though solid proof showed that they both are AI programs like O'Malley the whole time ). Both characters where blown up during the course of the series, existing from that point onward in robot bodies other than their originals. They possess mechanical bodies similar to Lopez in design.

===Podcasts===
* '''Little Button Puss''', character from Episode #310 of the ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang!]]'' podcast, played by [[John Gemberling]].  Little Button Puss, a.k.a. '''HPDP69-B''', is a promotional robot built by [[Hewlett-Packard]] and is the first ever robot created with a fully sentient artificial intelligence, personality, and speaking function. It was designed by HP engineers for the express purpose of sexually pleasing humans. ''Comedy Bang! Bang!'' host [[Scott Aukerman]] was sent Little Button Puss as part of a promotional advertising campaign for the line of sex-robots. Little Button Puss looks like a metal dog, and has small flesh patches where its genitals are. Elsewhere, it's described as having the appearance of "nickel blue, gun metal". It is verified in the episode that Scott Aukerman lustily removed Little Button Puss's retractable genitals, threw them in a trash can, and then proceeded to use the HPDP69-B for its intended purpose.  Afterwards, according to ''Comedy Bang! Bang!'' official canon, Aukerman looked back on the incident with shame. A complaint about the HPDP69-B is that, for a sex-robot, "it looks too much like a metal dog". In a brief look into its past, Little Button Puss recounts an old romantic relationship with its long lost love, [[United Flight 93]], who "died in the [[September 11th attacks]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.earwolf.com/episode/little-button-puss/ | title=Little Button Puss, episode #310 of Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast on Earwolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such sports also have a vibrant [[Athlete|community of amateur players]], from whom the best rise to become professionals.

==Association football==
{{Main|Association football}}
{{See also| National Football League|American Football League|Canadian Football League}}

[[Rugby football]] in Canada had its origins in the early 1860s, and over time, a unique code of football known as [[Canadian football]] developed. Both the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), the sport's top professional league, and [[Football Canada]], the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1882 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union (later reorganized as the Canadian Rugby Union). In 1909, the [[Grey Cup]] was donated by the then [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey]], to recognize the top amateur rugby football team in Canada. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the two senior leagues of the CRU (the [[Canadian Football League East Division|Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] and the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Interprovincial Football Union]]) gradually evolved from amateur to professional leagues, and found they had less and less in common with the amateur leagues, and consequently in 1956 formed a new umbrella organization, the Canadian Football Council. In 1958, the CFC left the CRU altogether and was renamed the Canadian Football League. By this time, teams from the amateur [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]] had stopped challenging for the Grey Cup, and ever since, it has been exclusively awarded to CFL teams. Since 1965, [[CIS football|university teams]] have competed for the [[Vanier Cup]].&lt;ref name="Football Canada timeline"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.footballcanada.com/history_timeline.asp |title=Canadian Football Timelines (1860 – present) |accessdate=2006-12-23 |publisher=[[Football Canada]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228064050/http://www.footballcanada.com/history_timeline.asp |archivedate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian rules football==

{{Main|Australian rules football}}


Unlike other sports, Australian rules football has not resisted becoming a professional sport.

Although the sport began as amateur competition, the [[Australian Football League]] is an elite professional league and has been for nearly 80 years since its initial formation as the Victorian Football Association and then the Victorian Football League in 1897. The league changed its name to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) in 1990 amid the increasing professionalism and national expansion of the game.

The game was invented in the [[United States]] in the 1890s, in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. The first professional basketball leagues emerged in the 1920s in the [[United States]].  Prominent among these were the [[American Basketball League (1925-1955)|American Basketball League]], which formed in 1925, and the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]], which was launched in 1937 by General Electric, Firestone and Goodyear as a way to improve their national profile.&lt;ref name="Steve Dimitry"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/6925/abl1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+07:07:30 "Steve Dimitry's Extinct Sports Leagues."]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946 the [[Basketball Association of America]] was founded by the owners of major sports arenas, particularly the [[Madison Square Garden]]. The BAA later merged with the NBL in 1949 to become the [[National Basketball Association]], the preeminent league in the world with 29 teams in the United States and one in Canada.  The [[American Basketball Association]], founded in 1967, subsequently joined the NBA in the 1976 [[ABA-NBA merger]].

The second-oldest professional basketball league in the world is the [[Philippine Basketball Association]]. The PBA was long considered to be the best league in [[Asia]], but the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] has grown tremendously in recent years. The league was born on April 9, 1975 at the [[Araneta Coliseum]], [[Cubao]], [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]].

Outside of the NBA, the top professional leagues in the world are those of [[FIBA Europe]]. According to the [[European national basketball league rankings|official league rankings]] produced by [[Euroleague Basketball (company)|Euroleague Basketball]], the body that conducts the continent-wide [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]], the top five national domestic leagues on the continent (from 1 to 5) are those [[Liga ACB]] (Spain), the [[Russian Professional Basketball League]], the [[Greek Basket League]], [[Lega Basket Serie A]] (Italy), and the [[Turkish Basketball League]].

European basketball is also characterized by its long established and well-developed transnational club competitions, most notably the Euroleague, which features top clubs from as many as 18 different domestic leagues. Two other continental club competitions, the [[ULEB Eurocup]] and [[EuroChallenge]], are also conducted annually. Europe also has transnational regional leagues, such as the [[Liga ABA]] (Adriatic League, formerly [[Yugoslavian Basketball League|Yugoslavian League]]), and [[Baltic Basketball League]] (originally limited to the Baltic states, now also including Kazakhstan).

==Cricket==
{{Main|History of English amateur cricket}}
{{See also|World Series Cricket|County cricket}}

Cricket at the highest level has developed into a fully professional international sport from which leading players can earn a large income. However professionalism has a long history in English cricket. The first professionals had appeared by the first half of the eighteenth century, when heavy gambling on the game encouraged wealthy patrons to draft the best players into their teams. They would often offer these players full-time employment as gardeners or gamekeepers on their estates. In the second half of the century, the famous Hambledon Club paid its players match fees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In the middle of the nineteenth century William Clarke's All-England Eleven was a highly successful all-professional venture which did much to popularise the game. The earliest overseas tours were also all-professional affairs.

In the early 21st century cricket is as lucrative as some other sports, and domestic cricketers typically earn several times the average salary in their country. Regular members of the [[England cricket team|English cricket team]] earn several hundred thousand [[pound sterling|pounds]] a year. However, the highest paid cricketers in the world are the star members of the [[Australia national cricket team|Australian cricket team]] or the [[India national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] who make most of their income from endorsement contracts.

==Ice hockey==
{{Main|Professional ice hockey}}
It is played with two teams, while 5 skaters and 1 goalie are allowed on the ice at a time. In NHL rules, the periods are 20 minutes long. There are three periods.

The 64-member governing body is the International Ice Hockey Federation, (IIHF). Ice hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924, and was in the 1920 Summer Olympics. North America's [[National Hockey League]] is the strongest professional ice hockey league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe. The NHL rules are slightly different from those used in Olympic hockey.

Ice hockey sticks are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, graphite, or composites with a blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright and can curve either way as to help a left- or right-handed player gain an advantage.

There are early representations and reports of hockey-type games being played on ice in the Netherlands, and reports from Canada from the beginning of the nineteenth century, but the modern game was initially organized by students at McGill University, Montreal in 1875 and, by two years later, codified the first set of ice hockey rules and organized the first teams.

==Lacrosse==

Lacrosse is played mainly in [[North America]], however, countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have small lacrosse leagues. It has also expanded into both Europe and Asia, with the latter forming the Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union (APLU) in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://filacrosse.com/fil-welcomes-the-aplu/|title=Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union|accessdate=2016-02-26|publisher=[[Federation of International Lacrosse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States currently has two top-level professional lacrosse leagues in operation, [[Major League Lacrosse]] and the [[National Lacrosse League]].

==Rugby league==
{{See also|History of rugby league|Football}}

Rugby league came into existence due to the very issue of professionalism. Rugby football split into 'union' and 'league' over the issue of payment to player. Rugby league favoured payments and has thus been a professional sport since its [[1895–96 Northern Rugby Football Union season|beginnings in 1895]], when 22 clubs based in northern England [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|split]] from the more amateur-minded [[Rugby Football Union]]. The officially amateur RFU had previously brought charges of professionalism against some clubs for their use of "broken time" payments to compensate players for missing work due to matches or injuries received whilst playing. On August 29, 1895 in a meeting at the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield]], the clubs decided to break away and form the Northern Rugby Union, which later would become the [[Rugby Football League]]. The rules of rugby league were gradually changed so that now it and rugby union are distinctly different games, however rugby union has since turned professional as well. On 17 December 1967 the first professional Sunday matches of rugby league were played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Rugby union ==

{{See also|History of rugby union|Football}}

Rugby union continued with its amateur ideals past the schism between union and league and throughout much of the 20th century. This position changed in 1995. The threat of big payments from professional rugby league clubs in countries where rugby league had a significant following was becoming too great. A committee conclusion decided that the only way to end this threat, the hypocrisy of [[Shamateurism]] and keep control of rugby union was to make the sport professional. On August 26, 1995 the International Rugby Board declared rugby union an "open" game and thus removed all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game.

The PBR is different from the classic rodeo as it consists of only bull riding. It was founded in 1992 because a group of bull riders decided that their sport should be separated from the classic rodeo and could, as it was easily the most popular event. Riders and bulls are judged on a 50-point scale. Riders are only given a score if they stay on for the mandatory 8 seconds, while bull scores are given regardless of what the rider does.

'''''Marry Me a Little''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with lyrics and music by [[Stephen Sondheim]], conceived by [[Craig Lucas]] and [[Norman René]]. The revue sets songs cut from Sondheim's better-known musicals, as well as songs from his then-unproduced musical ''[[Saturday Night (musical)|Saturday Night]]''  to a dialogue-free plot about the relationship between two lonely New York single people, who are in emotional conflict during an evening in their separate one-room apartments. Despite knowing of the other's existence, they never get up the courage to talk to each other, though they imagine what such an encounter might be like.&lt;ref&gt;Sommer, Elyse.[http://www.curtainup.com/marryme.html ''Marry Me a Little'' review] curtainup.com, October 19, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==History==

In late 1998 actor Steve Gideon proposed a revival of the work with the casting of a male same-sex couple to play the leads. He approached Stephen Sondheim with the idea and was given permission. The new version of the work debuted at the [[Celebration Theatre]] in Hollywood, CA in 1999.

A version of the main title with [[Harry Nilsson]] singing can be found on bootlegs.

In 2008, ''Marry Me a Little'' was performed in South Africa in a production starring David Fick opposite Talia Egelhof and then Nathan Fredericks in two successive runs of the show at the Intimate Theatre in Cape Town from 28 June - 5 July. The production was directed by Jacqui Kowen, with musical direction by Victor Tichart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2008/06/20/NJ/7/WESteater20.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|work=1.87|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129022241/http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2008/06/20/NJ/7/WESteater20.html|archive-date=2014-11-29|dead-url=yes|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Off-Broadway Keen Company presented a new version of ''Marry Me a Little'' starring [[Jason Tam]] and [[Lauren Molina]]. This production included several new songs and a new concept.  The production was directed by Jonathan Silverstein and started previews September 11, 2012, opening October 2, 2012 at the Clurman Theatre at [[Theatre Row (New York City)|Theatre Row]].  Both [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[Craig Lucas]] were involved in the project.

In January, 2013, The [[New Repertory Theatre]] in Watertown, Massachusetts, under the direction of Ilyse Robbins, received permission to do a gender-neutral staging of ''Marry Me a Little'', using four actors—two women and two men—and two pianists.  The action here takes place in four apartments in Manhattan, with varying pairing up on songs as man and woman, woman and woman, and man and man (this latter pairing effectively used especially in the lyrics of "So Many People" from ''Saturday Night'').  At the end of the performance the four actors do meet for a closing finale.

In March, 2014, a Canadian production of ''Marry Me a Little'' opened at the [[Tarragon Theatre]] in [[Toronto]], directed by Adam Brazier and starring Elodie Gillett and Adrian Marchuk. The production showed the two characters living together in a relationship that eventually comes to an end.

From June 29 to August 10, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjamestheatre.co.uk/events/marry-me-a-little/|title=Marry Me a Little|work=St James Theatre|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a British production opened at the [[St. James Theatre, London|St James Theatre]] in [[London]], directed by [[Hannah Chissick]], under the musical direction of [[David Randall]], and starring [[Simon Bailey (actor)|Simon Bailey]] and [[Laura Pitt-Pulford]]. The critically acclaimed, sell-out production went on to get another week at the St James Theatre's Studio from October 6 to October 11, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjamestheatre.co.uk/events/marry-me-a-little-2/|title=Marry Me a Little|work=St James Theatre|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 28 to February 13, 2017, the show will be presented at The Gallery Players directed by Barrie Gelles and starring Jesse Manocherian, [[Alyson Leigh Rosenfeld]], Adrian Rifat, Paul Williams, Cassandra Dupler and Laura Cetti. A first for this show, there will be three rotating casts performing each weekend: one duo is male and female, one is an all-male duo, and one is an all-female duo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/brooklyn/article/The-Gallery-Players-PresentsStephen-SondheimsMARRY-ME-A-LITTLE-20170112|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mrs Patrick Campbell''' (9 February 1865 – 9 April 1940), born '''Beatrice Rose Stella Tanner''' and known informally as "'''Mrs Pat'''", was an English stage actress.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Early life and marriages==
Campbell was born Beatrice Rose Stella Tanner in [[Kensington]], London, to John Tanner (1829–1895) and Maria Luigia Giovanna ("Louisa Joanna") née Romanini (1836–1908), daughter of Count Angelo Romanini. She studied for a short time at the [[Guildhall School of Music]]. During her first marriage, from which she took the name by which she is generally known, she gave birth to two children, Alan "Beo" Urquhart and Stella. Her first husband died in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] in 1900.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Fourteen years later, Campbell became the second wife of [[George Cornwallis-West]], a writer and soldier previously married to [[Lady Randolph Churchill|Jennie Jerome]], the mother of Sir [[Winston Churchill]]. Notwithstanding her second marriage she continued to use the stage name "Mrs Patrick Campbell".&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Stage career==
[[File:Mrs. Patrick Campbell 1.jpg|thumb|left|187px|Mrs Patrick Campbell]]

Beatrice Tanner made her professional stage debut in 1888 at the [[Alexandra Theatre (Liverpool)|Alexandra Theatre]], Liverpool, four years after her marriage to Patrick Campbell. In March 1890, she appeared in London at the [[Adelphi Theatre|Adelphi]], where she afterward played again in 1891–93. She became successful after starring in Sir [[Arthur Wing Pinero]]'s play, ''[[The Second Mrs Tanqueray]]'', in 1893, at St. James's Theatre where she also appeared in 1894 in ''[[The Masqueraders]]''. As Kate Cloud in ''[[John-a-Dreams]]'', produced by [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree|Beerbohm Tree]] at the [[Haymarket Theatre|Haymarket]] in 1894, she had another success, and again as Agnes in ''[[The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith]]'' at the [[Garrick Theatre|Garrick]] (1895).

Among her other performances were those in ''[[Fédora (play)|Fédora]]'' (1895), ''[[Little Eyolf]]'' (1896), and her notable performances with [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson|Forbes-Robertson]] at the [[Lyceum Theatre (London)|Lyceum]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in the rôles of [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]] in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'', and [[Lady Macbeth (Shakespeare)|Lady Macbeth]] (1895–98) in ''[[Macbeth]]''. Once established as a major star, Campbell assisted in the early careers of some noted actors, such as [[Gerald Du Maurier]] and [[George Arliss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|1985|pp=179–181, 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, "Mrs Pat", having become her own Manager/Director, made her debut performance on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in New York City in ''[[Heimat (play)|Heimat]]'' by [[Hermann Sudermann]], a marked success. Subsequent appearances in New York and on tour in the US established her as a major theatrical presence there. Campbell would regularly perform on the New York stage until 1933. Other performances included roles in ''[[The Joy of Living]]'' (1902), ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (play)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' (1904; as Melisande to the Pelleas of her friend [[Sarah Bernhardt]]), ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1907), ''[[Hugo von Hofmannsthal|Electra]]'' (1908), ''[[The Thunderbolt]]'' (1908), and ''Bella Donna'' (1911).

[[File:Cover-play1913.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Illustration for [[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]], depicting Mrs Campbell as Eliza]]

In 1914, she played Eliza Doolittle in the original West End production of ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' which [[George Bernard Shaw]] had expressly written for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Huggett|1969|pp=20–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|1985|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although forty-nine years old when she originated the role opposite the Henry Higgins of [[Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], she triumphed and took the play to New York and on tour in 1915 with the much younger [[Philip Merivale]] playing Higgins. She successfully played Eliza again in a 1920 London revival of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Huggett|1969|pp=183–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|1985|pp=364–367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A couple of "Mrs Pat"'s later significant performances were as the title role in the 1922 West End production of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''[[Hedda Gabler]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|1985|pp=379–382}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mrs. Alving in the "Ibsen Centennial" (1928) staging of ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (with [[John Gielgud]] as her son Oswald).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|1985|pp=397–398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her last major stage role was in the Broadway production of [[Ivor Novello]]'s play ''A Party'' where she portrayed the cigar-smoking, pekinese wielding actress "Mrs. MacDonald" – a clear takeoff on her own well known persona – and made off with the best reviews. In her later years, Campbell made notable appearances in films, including ''[[One More River]]'' (1934), ''Riptide'' (1934), and ''[[Crime and Punishment (1935 American film)|Crime and Punishment]]'' (1935). Her tendency, however, to reject roles that could have vitally helped her career in later years caused [[Alexander Woollcott]] to declare "...she was like a sinking ship firing on the rescuers".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|1985|pp=422–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with George Bernard Shaw==

In the late 1890s Campbell first became aware of [[George Bernard Shaw]] – the famous and feared dramatic critic for ''The Saturday Review'' – who lavishly praised her better performances and thoroughly criticised her lesser efforts. Shaw had already used her as inspiration for some of his plays before their first meeting in 1897 when he unsuccessfully tried to persuade "Mrs Pat" to play the role of Judith Anderson in the first production of his play ''[[The Devil's Disciple]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|1985|pp=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1912, when they began negotiations for the London production of ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', did Shaw develop an infatuation for "Mrs Pat" that resulted in a passionate, yet unconsummated, love affair of mutual fascination and a legendary exchange of letters.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Shaw and Mrs. Patrick Campbell: Their Correspondence edited by Alan Dent, 1952 Alfred A Knopf&lt;/ref&gt; It was Campbell who broke off the relationship &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|1985|pp=330–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Shaw was about to direct her in ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]''. They remained friends in spite of the break-up and her subsequent marriage to George Cornwallis-West, but Shaw never again allowed her to originate any of the roles he had written with her in mind (e.g. Hesione Hushabye (''[[Heartbreak House]]''), the Serpent (''[[Back to Methuselah]]''), etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|1985|pp=404–407}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Anthony Asquith was preparing to produce the 1938 film of ''[[Pygmalion (1938 film)|Pygmalion]]'', Shaw suggested Campbell for the role of Mrs Higgins but she declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Huggett|1969|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait photograph of Mrs. Patrick Campbell.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Portrait photograph]]

In later years, Shaw refused to allow the impoverished Campbell to publish or sell any of their letters except in heavily edited form, for fear of upsetting his wife [[Charlotte Payne-Townshend]] and the possible harm that the letters might cause to his public image.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|1985|pp=369–378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the letters were not published until 1952, two years after Shaw's death.

==Famous quotes==
[[File:Ranken, William Bruce Ellis; Mrs Patrick Campbell.jpg|thumb|Mrs Patrick Campbell by [[William Bruce Ellis Ranken]]]]

Campbell was infamous for her sharp wit. Her best-known remark, uttered upon hearing about a male homosexual relationship, was "My dear, I don't care what they do, so long as they don't do it in the street and frighten the horses,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dent|1961|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this remark has been attributed to others as well. 

At a dinner in the United States, she was seated next to a scientist who talked incessantly to her about ants. "They even have their own police force and army", he enthused. "No navy?" she replied.&lt;ref&gt;Great British Wit, Rosemarie Jarski, Ebury Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Campbell died on 9 April 1940 in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau, France]], aged 75, of [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Campbell, 75, Famous Actress|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E1FF93E54117A93C3A8178FD85F448485F9|quote=Mrs. Patrick Campbell, famous actress, died last night in Pau, according to word received here to day. She had taken leading roles in plays of Shakespeare, Shaw and Barrie, and on several occasions had toured America.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 April 1940|accessdate=29 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her death was one of the few deaths of a personal nature that [[George Bernard Shaw]] ever noted in his personal diaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|1985|p=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A note book belonging to Campbell is housed at the [[University of Birmingham]] Special Collections Department. Several collections of Campbell's correspondence, including her letters to Shaw (MS Thr 372.1), are part of the Harvard Theatre Collection at [[Houghton Library]], Harvard University. A number of her letters and her annotated script for Chester Bailey Fernald's ''The Moonlight Blossom'' are in the theatre manuscripts collection of the [[Harry Ransom Center]], University of Texas at Austin. The Ransom Center's collection of Shaw papers includes letters from Campbell, and the library includes a number of Shaw's published works from Campbell's private library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingaid.cfm?eadid=00121p1&amp;showrequest=1|title=George Bernard Shaw: An Inventory of His Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|website=norman.hrc.utexas.edu|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Her father John Tanner (1829–1895), a descendant of [[Thomas Tanner (bishop)|Thomas Tanner]], Bishop of St Asaph,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Consul and merchant who "managed to get through two large fortunes",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part through losses in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny]].

Her mother, Louisa Joanna Romanini, was one of the eight daughters of Angelo Romanini of Brescia and Rosa née Polinelli of Milan. Angelo had joined the [[Carbonari]] and, as a result, had to leave Italy. He and his family travelled over Eastern Europe aided by a ''[[firman]]'' from the Sultan of Turkey. Six of his eight daughters, all under eighteen, married Englishmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first husband Patrick Campbell (1855–1900) was the son of Patrick McMicken Campbell (1826–1896), a banker who was the Chief Manager of the [[Oriental Bank Corporation]], and his first wife Montgomerie Anne née Kerr (1836–1869). After her death he married her cousin, Alicia Anne Kerr.

Patrick and Beatrice first met at a card party at the house of Mrs Gifford in [[Dulwich]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eloped within four months to marry at St Helen, Bishopsgate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick's health was poor and in 1887 he was ordered by his doctor to take a sea voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was to stay away for six and a half years in [[Australia]] and then [[Mashonaland]]. He found some work but never sent enough back for Beatrice and the children to live on. When he returned in 1893, she saw that "his health and energies were undermined by fever, failure, and the most bitter disappointments",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas she was by then a successful actress. In mid-March 1900, Patrick returned to [[South Africa]] to join [[Imperial Yeomanry|Lord Chesham's Yeomanry]]. He was killed [[Battle of Boshof|in a charge]] at [[Boshof]] on 5 April,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same action in which [[George Henri Anne-Marie Victor de Villebois-Mareuil|Colonel George de Villebois-Mareuil]] died.

Their son Alan Urquhart 'Beo' Campbell (1885–1917) became a Naval Cadet in 1898 at [[Britannia Royal Naval College|HMS ''Britannia'']] and was about to take his naval entrance exams when his father died in 1900. He left the navy that year and went to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later worked as an actor. In 1908, on tour with his mother he met Helen Parker Bull (1885–1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married in 1909 in [[Quincy, Illinois]], and divorced in 1915. He re-joined the [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNVR]] at the outbreak of war and became a Lieutenant Commander, being awarded the [[Military Cross]] and [[medal bar|bar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supplement to the London Gazette|date=13 February 1917|page=1539|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/29940/supplement/1539/data.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December 1917 he was killed by a shell while serving in the Royal Naval Division at La Vacquerie on the [[Cambrai]] front.

Their daughter Stella (1886-1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stella Patrick Campbell |url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp68686/stella-patrick-campbell |publisher=National Portrait Gallery |accessdate=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; also joined her mother on stage, and toured with her in the USA, but "made up her mind to marry a man [Beatrice] scarcely knew, who had lived in Africa for many years".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stella left for Kenya in early 1911 to marry 
Mervyn Worcester Howard Beech (1881–1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Campbell produced ''His Borrowed Plumes'' by [[Lady Randolph Churchill]], whose husband, [[George Cornwallis-West]], was "seriously attracted to me".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married on 6 April 1914, the day after the [[decree nisi|decree absolute]] of his divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campbell|1922|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nightclub management software''' ('''NMS''') or a '''nightclub management system''' is a compiled [[management information system]] produced solely for [[night club|nightclubs]], such as the [[ministry of sound|Ministry Of Sound]], and can also be modified for [[bar (establishment)|bars]], [[arts festival|festivals]], [[Public house|pubs]], and [[concert|live events]]. These systems will commonly cover the needs of [[night club|nightclubs]] in the form of CRM, bookings, ticketing, [[point of sale|EPOS]], and administration capabilities for running the [[Music venue|venue]]. With the Nightclub industry in contraction during the period of [[great recession|recession]] during 2007-2009 many nightclubs are sourcing new avenues for marketing reach expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ibis World|title=Nightclubs in the UK: Market Research Report|url=http://www.ibisworld.co.uk/market-research/nightclubs.html|work=Market Research|date=2015-07-01|accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

Nightclub management software solutions typically cover a broad spectrum of aspects in running a venue such as:
*Tracking Bookings
*Stock Management
*Electronic point of sale terminals

The standard NMS forgoes the traditional software installation and instead relies on cloud computing storing all data on remote servers which allow for user access for an unlimited number of computers based anywhere within reach of an internet connection. Many NMS providers base the pricing structure from a [[software as a service]]/[[application service provider]] model.

Nightclubs use specific software to meet the complex requirements of their business. Typically small scale venues will manage their business with a generic accounting package and extend functionality with plugin's or other bolt-on software. The advantage for nightclubs running a specialized system are numerous, however the primary outcome is a more efficient venue. Nightclub Management software typically encompasses all the tools mentioned above however difficulty arises when nightclub staff are evaluating vendors and deciding what software to implement. Integration of these tools is key but venue principals and other key staff still need to pay attention to other factors such as cost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3099">'''Paxtang Park''' was a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[trolley park]] near [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]. It existed from 1823 to 1929 between Derry Street and Paxton Street along Spring Creek. The park contained two [[roller coasters]], the Coaster Flyer and the Jack Rabbit.

==History==
Paxtang Park was leased to the East Harrisburg Street Electric Railway Company on July 19, 1893, for a ten-year term. Plans included constructing a fence surrounding the property, though the park would remain free entry, a pavilion to hold several hundred people, new shaded areas, benches, and a "gravity railroad" (or [[Roller_coaster#Scenic_railways|scenic railway]]) for the following season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Improve The Resort - Several Thousand Dollars To Be Spent in Improving Paxtang |newspaper=Harrisburg Telegraph |date=July 20, 1893 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paxtang Park - Attractions Which Will Be Added to the Grounds in a Short Time. |newspaper=Harrisburg Daily Independent |date=July 20, 1893 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gravity railroad was not installed in 1894, nor was it ever operational; it wasn't until 1905 that the park added its first roller coaster - Coaster Flyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Big Force of Men Now Working on the New Roller Coaster |newspaper=Harrisburg Daily Independent |date=May 15, 1905 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite RCDB |coaster_name=Coaster Flyer |location=Paxtang Park |rcdb_number=2688 |accessdate=February 7, 2015 |url=http://rcdb.com/2688.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a [[Figure 8 roller coaster]] and operated from 1905 until 1922. 

In 1922, the railroad company announced they would not renew the lease on the grounds of Paxtang Park for a fourth lease - they had renewed twice before in 1903 and 1913. They were no longer able to afford the costs of operating the park, so they announced 1922 would be the final season of Paxtang Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paxtang Park Is To Be Abandoned After This Year |newspaper=Harrisburg Telegraph |date=March 15, 1922 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August, an amusement company from Newark, New Jersey was able to take control of the lease from the railroad company. They pledged many improvements to the park, which included a new roller coaster and other amusements. 

The park had some success, however by the late 1920s, they were struggling to open the park before the [[Fourth of July]], when it used to open before [[Memorial Day]], and they were missing tax payments. In 1930, Steelton Bank and Trust took control of the property, and sold off the amusements and other things at a sale. The park was closed and never reopened.

'''Polskie Radio''' Spółka Akcyjna (PR S.A.; [[English language|English]]: Polish Radio) is [[Poland]]'s state-owned national public-service [[radio programming|radio]] broadcasting organization.

== History ==
Polskie Radio was founded on 18 August 1925 and began making regular broadcasts from [[Warsaw]] on 18 April 1926.

[[Czesław Miłosz]], recipient of the 1980 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], worked as a literary programmer at [[Polish Radio Wilno]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Haven | first = Cynthia L. | title = Czesław Miłosz: Conversations | publisher =[[University Press of Mississippi]] | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=r-fXgmb5EmEC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages = xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Second World War]], Polish Radio operated one national channel – broadcast from 1931 from one of Europe's most powerful [[longwave]] transmitters, situated at [[Raszyn]] just outside Warsaw and destroyed in 1939 due to invasion of [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] – and nine regional stations: 
*[[Kraków]] from 15 February 1927
*[[Poznań]] from 24 April 1927
*[[Katowice]] from 4 December 1927
*[[Vilnius|Wilno]] from 15 January 1928
*[[Lwów]] from 15 January 1930
*[[Łódź]] from 2 February 1930
*[[Toruń]] from 15 January 1935
*[[Warszawa]] from 1 March 1937 – known as Warszawa II, the national channel becoming Warszawa I from this date
*[[Baranovichi|Baranowicze]] from 1 July 1938
A tenth regional station was planned for [[Lutsk|Łuck]], but the outbreak of war meant that it never opened.

After the war, Polskie Radio came under the tutelage of the state public broadcasting body ''Komitet do Spraw Radiofonii'' "Polskie Radio" (later "Polskie Radio i Telewizja" – PRT, Polish Radio and Television). This body was dissolved in  1992, Polskie Radio S.A. and [[Telewizja Polska]] S.A. becoming politically dependent corporations, each of which was admitted to full active membership of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] on 1 January 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1169">SRS '''RoboMagellan''' or Robomagellan was created by the Seattle Robotics Society and is a small scale [[autonomous vehicle]] race in which robots navigate between predefined start and finish points. The start and finish points are usually represented as [[GPS]] coordinates and marked by orange traffic cones. In most versions of the competition there are also optional waypoints that the [[robot]] can navigate to in order to earn bonus points. The race is usually conducted on mixed pedestrian terrain which can include obstacles such as park benches, curbs, trees, bushes, hills, people, etc..

{{nihongo|'''Sarugaku'''|[[wikt:猿楽|猿楽]]||"monkey music"}}, was a form of [[theatre]] popular in [[Japan]] during the 11th to 14th centuries. It originated from "sangaku," a form of entertainment reminiscent of the modern-day [[circus]], consisting mostly of [[acrobatics]], [[juggling]], and [[pantomime]], sometimes combined with drum dancing. It came from [[China]] to Japan in the 8th century and there mingled with indigenous traditions, particularly the harvest celebrations of [[dengaku]]. In the 11th century, the form began to favor comic sketches while other elements faded away. By the late 12th century, the term "sarugaku" had come to include comic dialogues based on word play ([[toben]]), improvised comic party dances (''[[ranbu]]''), short plays involving several actors, and musical arrangements based on courtesan traditions. During the 13th century, there was increased standardization of words, gestures, musical arrangements, and program combinations; as well as the adoption of the guild (''za'') system to which all present-day Noh schools can be traced. ''[[Kyōgen]]'' also developed from sarugaku. 
Of particular significance is the development of sarugaku troupes in [[Yamato Province|Yamato]] around [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]] and [[Kyoto]] during the [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] and early [[Muromachi period]]s. In particular, the sarugaku Noh troupe Yuzaki, led by [[Kan'ami]], performed in 1374 before the young ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]]. The success of this one performance and the resultant shogunal patronage lifted the artform permanently out of the mists of its plebeian past. From then, the term sarugaku gave way to the current nomenclature, [[Noh]].

The Japanese term "Sarugaku" is also used in other contexts to refer to a job or profession that seems to debase the employee or to treat him or her as a source of entertainment rather than as a professional.&lt;ref&gt;BigDaikon.com, message board post {{cite web |url=http://bigdaikon.org/board/viewtopic.php?t=67618 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928193955/http://bigdaikon.org/board/viewtopic.php?t=67618 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}, (accessed May 14, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to William Scott Wilson, Saragaku translates to "monkey music", is an ancient form of drama, and is the predecessor to Noh. [[Takuan Sōhō]] states as fact that "the emperor's recitation is given like Sarugaku".&lt;ref&gt;Takuan Soho, translated by William Scott Wilson, "The Unfettered Mind – Writings of the Zen Master to the Sword Master", p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Signal processing''' is a subfield of [[mathematics]], [[Information engineering (field)|information]] and [[electrical engineering]] that concerns the analysis, synthesis, and modification of [[signal]]s, which are broadly defined as functions conveying "information about the behavior or attributes of some phenomenon",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBT7nP7zTLgC&amp;pg=PA1|title=Introductory Signal Processing|author=Roland Priemer|first=|publisher=World Scientific|year=1991|isbn=9971509199|location=|page=1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[audio signal processing|sound]], [[image processing|images]], and biological measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sengupta|first=Nandini|author2=Sahidullah, Md|author3=Saha, Goutam|title=Lung sound classification using cepstral-based statistical features|journal=Computers in Biology and Medicine|date=August 2016|volume=75|issue=1|pages=118–129|doi=10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.05.013|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482516301263}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, signal processing techniques are used to improve signal transmission fidelity, storage efficiency, and subjective quality, and to emphasize or detect components of interest in a measured signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Discrete-Time Signal Processing |page=1 |author=Alan V. Oppenheim and Ronald W. Schafer |isbn=0-13-216771-9 |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to [[Alan V. Oppenheim]] and [[Ronald W. Schafer]], the principles of signal processing can be found in the classical [[numerical analysis]] techniques of the 17th century. Oppenheim and Schafer further state that the digital refinement of these techniques can be found in the digital [[control system]]s of the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Signal Processing |year=1975 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |isbn=0-13-214635-5 |author=Oppenheim, Alan V. |author2=Schafer, Ronald W. |page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==

===Analog===
{{main|Analog signal processing}}

Analog signal processing is for signals that have not been digitized, as in legacy radio, telephone, radar, and television systems. This involves linear electronic circuits as well as non-linear ones. The former are, for instance, [[passive filter]]s, [[active filter]]s, [[Electronic mixer|additive mixers]], [[integrator]]s and [[Analog delay line|delay line]]s. Non-linear circuits include [[compandor]]s, multiplicators ([[frequency mixer]]s and [[voltage-controlled amplifier]]s), [[voltage-controlled filter]]s, [[voltage-controlled oscillator]]s and [[phase-locked loop]]s.

===Continuous time===
[[Continuous signal|Continuous-time signal processing]] is for signals that vary with the change of continuous domain(without considering some individual interrupted points).

The methods of signal processing include [[time domain]], [[frequency domain]], and [[complex frequency|complex frequency domain]]. This technology mainly discusses the modeling of linear time-invariant continuous system, integral of the system's zero-state response, setting up system function and the continuous time filtering of deterministic signals

===Discrete time===
[[Discrete-time signal|Discrete-time signal processing]] is for sampled signals, defined only at discrete points in time, and as such are quantized in time, but not in magnitude.

''Analog discrete-time signal processing'' is a technology based on electronic devices such as [[sample and hold]] circuits, analog time-division [[multiplexer]]s, [[analog delay line]]s and [[analog feedback shift register]]s. This technology was a predecessor of digital signal processing (see below), and is still used in advanced processing of gigahertz signals.

The concept of discrete-time signal processing also refers to a theoretical discipline that establishes a mathematical basis for digital signal processing, without taking [[quantization error]] into consideration.

===Digital===
{{main|Digital signal processing}}

Digital signal processing is the processing of digitized discrete-time sampled signals. Processing is done by general-purpose [[computer]]s or by digital circuits such as [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s, [[field-programmable gate array]]s or specialized [[digital signal processor]]s (DSP chips). Typical arithmetical operations include [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]], real-valued and complex-valued, multiplication and addition. Other typical operations supported by the hardware are [[circular buffer]]s and [[lookup table]]s. Examples of algorithms are the [[Fast Fourier transform]] (FFT), [[finite impulse response]] (FIR) filter, [[Infinite impulse response]] (IIR) filter, and [[adaptive filter]]s such as the [[Wiener filter|Wiener]] and [[Kalman filter]]s.

===Nonlinear===
Nonlinear signal processing involves the analysis and processing of signals produced from nonlinear systems and can be in the time, frequency, or spatio-temporal domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Billings |first=S. A. |title=Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains |publisher=Wiley |year=2013 |isbn=1119943590 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonlinear systems can produce highly complex behaviors including [[bifurcation theory|bifurcations]], [[chaos theory|chaos]], [[harmonics]], and [[subharmonics]] which cannot be produced or analyzed using linear methods.

===Statistical===
Statistical signal processing is an approach which treats signals as [[stochastic process]]es, utilizing their [[statistics|statistical]] properties to perform signal processing tasks. Statistical techniques are widely used in signal processing applications. For example, one can model the [[probability distribution]] of noise incurred when photographing an image, and construct techniques based on this model to [[noise reduction|reduce the noise]] in the resulting image.

'''TVLine''' is a [[website]] devoted to information, news, and spoilers of [[television]] programs.

==History==
In late 2010, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{-'}}s [[Michael Ausiello]] announced that he would be leaving ''EW'' after nearly two years in their employ to establish a TV-centered website with [[Penske Media Corporation|PMC]], the media company founded by [[Jay Penske]]. He later announced that fellow ''EW'' writer Michael Slezak, [[E!|E! Online's]] Megan Masters, and ''[[TV Guide]]''{{-'}}s Matt Mitovich would be joining him in the venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.pmc.com/news/pressrelease/50.php |title=Entertainment Weekly's Michael Slezak Joins Michael Ausiello at TVLine.com |publisher=[[PMC (company)|PMC]] |date=2010-12-10 |accessdate=2011-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715010705/http://www.pmc.com/news/pressrelease/50.php |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site debuted January 5, 2011 and more than tripled initial expectations for internet traffic in its first six days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/tag/michael-ausiello-tvline/ |title=ADVISORY: Check Out New TVLine.com |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=2011-01-17 |first=Nikki |last=Finke |accessdate=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011 a report by [[TV by the Numbers]] analyzed the pageview ratings for four television websites: TVLine, its sister site ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'', ''[[TheWrap]]'', and TV by the Numbers itself. With a high of just over 1 million daily pageviews, TVLine beat all three competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/05/20/michael-ausiellos-tvline-already-bigger-than-nikki-finkes-deadline/93481/ |title=Michael Ausiello's TVLine Already Bigger Than Nikki Finke's Deadline |last=Seidman |first=Robert |publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=May 20, 2011|accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar report in summer 2012 compared TVLine again to three other websites: ''Deadline'', ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', and [[HitFix]]. TVLine hit a high of approximately 23 million monthly pageviews, second only to ''The Hollywood Reporter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/10/09/lost-in-the-pmcfinkedeadlinevariety-news-michael-ausiellos-tvline-is-a-traffic-powerhouse/152340/ |title=Lost in the PMC/Finke/Deadline/Variety News: Michael Ausiello’s TVLine is a Traffic Powerhouse |last=Seidman |first=Robert |publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=October 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326081001/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/10/09/lost-in-the-pmcfinkedeadlinevariety-news-michael-ausiellos-tvline-is-a-traffic-powerhouse/152340/ |archivedate=March 26, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tales''''' is a [[point-and-click]] [[adventure game]] developed by Ape Marina and published by Screen7. The game was released [[DRM-free]] on [[Steam software|Steam]], [[Humble Store|Humble Bundle]] and [[GOG.com|GOG]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]] on November 14, 2016. Since its release, it has been met with mostly positive reviews. Reviewers praised the story, puzzles, [[Voice acting|voice-acting]] and humor, noting it's great to play something suitable for the whole family.

== Overview ==
''Tales'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[point-and-click]] [[fantasy game|fantasy]] [[adventure video game]] in which stages are based on myths, legends and fairy-tale books. Each stage takes place within a different book. The player can move from one book to another in a [[non-linear]] way. The goal is to progress the main quest by solving puzzles, riddles and mini-games in each of the specific books.

Central to ''Tales'' is the magic bell item. This is a magical item that allows you to travel from book to book and is available in all stories. When the player travels into a new book, he leaves behind everything he had in the library and build a new inventory unique to that tale. The player can return to earlier books and replay them, possibly progressing the main quest.

The game is suitable for kids &amp; adults, containing no overly explicit adult themes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zodiac-store.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=2&amp;products_id=975 Tales game] www.zodiac-store.com&lt;/ref&gt; and playable in 6 different languages, English, Italian, Russian, French, German and Spanish.

==Plot==
=== Story ===
When a mysterious darkness is released from a forbidden book inside the library that he has inherited in unknown circumstances, a young man named Alfred Walsh must venture into the stories that have become affected by its power, assisted by none other than the sorcerer Merlin from the legends of King Arthur. Developed by Ape Marina, a small development team inspired by the works of Sierra and Lucasarts, Tales is a point and click adventure that gives us a whole new way to experience some of the world's most treasured literature.

Aggregating review website [[GameRankings]] rated the videogame at 80%. In 2017 the game was nominated for 7 [[AGS Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/wiki/AGS_Awards_2016 | title=7 AGS Awards Nominations for Tales | work= adventuregamestudio.co.uk | last= | first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''Best Game Created with AGS'', ''Best Gameplay'', ''Best Puzzles'' and ''Best Voice Acting''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://denhaagfm.nl/2017/02/07/haagse-acteur-vincent-van-ommen-twee-keer-genomineerd-voor-internationale-prijs/ | title=Haagse acteur Vincent van Ommen twee keer genomineerd voor internationale prijs | work=denhaagfm | last= | first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AdventureGamers awarded it 4 out of 5, specifically praising the graphics and artwork, saying "Every pixel has been crafted with care, making for lush, detailed backgrounds and nicely animated characters". The review also praises the fun gameplay with the dialogue puzzles, minigames and riddles, while noting the handling of the inventory can be quite frustrating at times. Despite small technical issues AdventureGamers recommends''Tales'', saying: "If you like myths and literature, meaty puzzles, or even just playing with Thor's hammer and Jack's beanstalk, this game comes heartily recommended".&lt;ref name="AG" /&gt;

FutureSack praised about the story-line and humor of ''Tales'', writing: "There are plenty of jokes for all ages to enjoy" and "It's great to see something suitable for the whole family".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futuresack.com/index.php/news/1348/56/Game-release-Tales-PC.htm Tales Review by Futuresack.com] futuresack.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Testiversum scored the game 8.1/10, the reviewer wrote "Tales is a clear recommendation for all point-and-click friends. An interesting story, exciting gameplay and challenging puzzles hide behind a slightly too typical sounding title", noting the technical aspects of the picture are slightly blocky and the resolution quite low.

[[Image:Toro de Fuego de Haro.jpg|thumb|Close view of the frame, in [[Haro, La Rioja]] (Spain).]]

A '''''toro de fuego''''' ("fire bull"), also known as '''''vaca loca''''' ("crazy cow") in [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]], is a festive activity in which a metal frame resembling a bull, with [[fireworks]] attached to it, is set alight, and then the person carrying the frame runs around town at night as if chasing people in the streets. Participants dodge the bull when it comes close, especially because the burning fireworks set off sparks that can cause small burns in people's skin or clothes. This activity is held in a number of [[Spain|Spanish]] towns during their [[Fiesta patronal|local festivals]]. It is possible that this custom originated in the ''[[Toro embolado]]'', in which a real bull is involved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7750">'''Video manipulation''' is a new variant of [[media manipulation]] that targets [[digital video]] using a combination of traditional [[video processing]] and [[video editing]] techniques and auxiliary methods from [[artificial intelligence]] like [[face recognition]]. In typical video manipulation, the facial structure, body movements, and voice of the subject are replicated in order to create a fabricated recording of the subject. The applications of these methods range from educational videos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The International Handbook of Virtual Learning Environments|last=Pea|first=Roy|date=2006|publisher=Springer|editor-last=Weiss|editor-first=J. et al.|pages=100–110|chapter=Chapter 55: Video-as-Data and Digital Video Manipulation Techniques for Transforming Learning Sciences Research, Education, and Other Cultural Practices}}&lt;/ref&gt; to videos aimed at ([[Crowd manipulation|mass]]) manipulation and [[propaganda]], a straightforward extension of the long-standing possibilities of [[photo manipulation]]. This form of computer-generated misinformation has contributed to [[fake news]], and there have been instances when this technology was used during political campaigns.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1145657/the-dangerous-new-technology-that-will-make-us-question-our-basic-idea-of-reality/|title=Fake news: The dangerous new technology that will make us question our basic idea of reality — Quartz|website=qz.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof-of-principle software ''Face2Face'' was developed at Stanford University. Such advanced video manipulation must be ranked alongside and beyond previous examples of [[deep fake]]s.

==History==
The concept of manipulating video can be traced back as far as the 1950s, when the 2 inch [[Quadruplex videotape|Quadruplex]] tape used in videotape recorders would be manually cut and spliced. After being coated with [[ferrofluid]], the two ends of tape that were to be joined were painted with a mixture of iron filings and carbon tetrachloride, a toxic and carcinogenic compound to make the tracks in the tape visible when viewed through a microscope so that they could be aligned in a splicer designed for this task&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.videomaker.com/article/2896-edit-suite-once-upon-a-time-the-history-of-videotape-editing|title=Edit Suite: Once Upon a Time: The History of Videotape Editing - Videomaker|date=1997-07-01|work=Videomaker|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the video cassette recorder developed in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the ability to record over an existing [[magnetic tape]] became possible. This led to the concept of overlaying specific parts of film to give the illusion of one consistently recorded video, which is the first identifiable instance of video manipulation.

In 1985, [[Quantel]] released The Harry, the first all-digital video editing and effects compositing system. It recorded and applied effects to a maximum of 80 seconds of 8-bit [[uncompressed]] digital video. A few years later, in 1991, [[Adobe Inc.|Adobe]] released its first version of [[Adobe Premiere Pro|Premiere]] for the Mac, a program that has since become an industry standard for editing and is now commonly used for video manipulation. In 1999, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] released [[Final Cut Pro]], which competed with Adobe Premiere and was used in the production major films such as ''The Rules of Attraction'' and ''No Country for Old Men''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/fun-facts-and-dates-in-digital-editing-firsts/|title=Fun Facts and Dates in Digital Editing 'Firsts' - The Beat: A Blog by PremiumBeat|date=2011-12-10|work=The Beat: A Blog by PremiumBeat|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Face detection]] became a major research subject in the early 2000s that has continued to be studied in the present. In 2017, an amateur coder named “DeepFakes” was altering pornography videos by digitally substituting the faces of celebrities for those in the original videos. The word [[deepfake]] has become a generic noun for the use of algorithms and facial-mapping technology to manipulate videos.

On the consumer side, popular video manipulation programs [[FaceApp]] and Faceswap, developed from similar technology, have become increasingly sophisticated.

==Types of video manipulation==
Computer applications are becoming more advance in terms of being able to generate fake audio and video content that look real.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/deepfake-videos-are-ruining-lives-is-democracy-next-1539595787?mod=hp_lead_pos5|title=Deepfake Videos Are Getting Real and That’s a Problem|last=Schellmann|first=Hilke|work=WSJ|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A video published by researchers depicts how video and audio manipulation works using facial recognition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Though video manipulation could be thought of as piecing together different [[video clips]], the types of video manipulation extend further than that. For example, an actor can sit in front of a camera moving his face. The computer then generates the same facial movement in real time on an existing video of [[Barack Obama]]. When the actor shakes his head, Obama also shakes his head, and the same happens when the actor speaks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Not only does this create fake [[content]], but it masks the content as even more authentic than other types of fake news, as video and audio were once the most [[reliable]] types of media for many people.

One of the most dangerous parts of video manipulation include the concept of politics; [[Political campaign|campaign]] videos are being manipulated to pose a threat to other nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Dartmouth University [[computer science]] professor Hany Farid commented on video manipulation and its dangers. Farid said that actors could generate videos of [[Donald Trump|Trump]] claiming to launch nuclear weapons. These fabricated videos could be shared on social media before the mistake can be fixed, possibly resulting in war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite the presence of manipulated video and audio, research teams are working to combat the issue. Prof. Christian Theobalt, a member of a team working on the technology at the Max-Planck-Institute for [[informatics]] in Germany, states that researchers have created forensic methods to detect fakes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Video Manipulation and fake news==
With fake news becoming increasingly prominent in popular culture and with rapid advancements of audio and video manipulation technology, the public is increasingly encountering fake news that is supported by deceptive videos.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In terms of types of fake news, the potential to be classified is ever-expanding, but include five main types — [[satire]] or [[parody]], [[selective reporting]], sloppy [[journalism]], [[clickbait]], and [[conspiracies]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though the five main types of fake news are prominent globally, one of the most destructive types of fake news lies within all five types and is video and audio manipulation. Video and audio manipulation are defined as a new variant of media manipulation which targets digital video using a combination of traditional [[video processing]] and video editing techniques with auxiliary methods from [[artificial intelligence]] like face recognition. The results range from artistic videos produced for [[aesthetic]] effects to videos aimed at (mass) manipulation and propaganda, a straightforward extension of the long-standing possibilities of [[photo manipulation]].

'''Miriam Kate Williams''' (1874 &amp;ndash; 1946), sometimes called '''Kate Roberts''' and better known by her [[stage name]] '''Vulcana''', was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[strongwoman]] born of [[Ireland|Irish]] parents in [[Abergavenny]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]].

With [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] [[William Hedley Roberts]], better known as Atlas, she toured [[music hall]]s in Britain, Europe, and Australia. The couple performed as The Atlas and Vulcana Group of Society Athletes.&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;{{Citation

==Early life==
Kate Williams was born to a popular local preacher, and worked at a tannery in [[Abergavenny]]. She met William Roberts at the local women's gymnasium he ran in 1890, when she was fifteen.  They fell in love; in spite of Roberts already having a wife and family, they left town together and were never parted for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="Home_Truths"&gt;{{Citation

==Performing career==
Williams's first professional appearance was as a replacement act at a fete hosted by Roberts in [[Pontypool]], [[Wales]]. They began to be billed together as Atlas and Vulcana from the time of their first appearances in London in 1892. In 1903, Vulcana and Atlas were engaged by [[Harry Rickards]] and toured [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="1903 Aus"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55613139 | title=CHAMPION FEMALE WEIGHT LIFTER | work=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] | date=15 December 1903 | accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlas, a true showman of his times, greatly exaggerated his own and Vulcana's lifting capacities, and most of his published boasts have been dismissed. On more than one occasion, he was challenged to his face and shown to be using weights lighter than he claimed.&lt;ref name="Webster" /&gt; At these times, Vulcana's reputation suffered alongside his, although her authenticated accomplishments were genuinely remarkable for a woman of her era.

===Authenticated feats of strength===
[[Image:Vulcanaflexing.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Vulcana flexing on the cover of ''La Santé par les Sports'']]
Vulcana reached the height of her popularity in [[France]], impressing the Halterophile Club de France with her feats of strength, which earned her a medal from the "Father of French Bodybuilding", Professor [[Edmond Desbonnet]] and a picture on the cover of ''[[La Santé par les Sports]]''. She was honored with over one hundred medals throughout her career.

Her best-authenticated feats were [[bent press]] with her right hand of at least 124½ [[pound (mass)|lb]] (56.5 [[kilogram|kg]]), with some authorities accepting a press of 145&amp;nbsp;lb (66&amp;nbsp;kg), and an [[overhead lift]] with a 56&amp;nbsp;lb (25&amp;nbsp;kg) weight in each hand.

She freed a wagon stuck in [[Maiden Lane, Covent Garden]], London in October 1901 by lifting it before astonished witnesses.

Authorities believe Vulcana reached the peak of her strength in about 1910. On 29 May 1913 at [[William Haggar|Haggar's]] Theatre in [[Llanelly|Llanelly]], she lifted a challenge bell that rival strongwoman [[Athelda]] failed to raise after twenty-five minutes of trying.

===Authenticated feats of heroism===
A woman publicly displaying strength was sufficient to generate ''[[succès de scandale]]'', as [[publicity stunt]]s were then called, and Vulcana was no stranger to the art of aggrandizing tales of her exploits. However, some of the stories about her are based on genuine incidents of heroism on her part:

*In 1888, at the age of thirteen, she stopped a runaway horse in [[Bristol]].
*She rescued two children from drowning in the [[River Usk]] in July 1901, for which she received an award in gratitude.
*In 1910, Vulcana was the first to alert the [[police]] of the disappearance of her friend, Cora Crippen,&lt;ref name="Home_Truths" /&gt; ultimately leading to the investigation, prosecution and execution of Cora's husband, [[Hawley Harvey Crippen|Dr. Hawley Crippen]].
*On 4 June 1921 the Garrick Theatre in [[Edinburgh]] caught fire on an evening of the Society Athletes' performance. Vulcana risked her life to save another act's horses, and came away with serious burns on her head. For this she won commendations and an award.

===Reported feats===
*In 1902, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' reported that Vulcana had knocked out a pickpocket who was attempting to steal her purse.&lt;ref name="Punch 1902"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65879510 | title=From "Punch." | work=[[Morwell Advertiser]] | date=12 December 1902 | accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
Vulcana and Atlas moved permanently to London in the 1920s, and retired from performance in 1932.

Vulcana was hit by a car in London in 1939, and was conscious when she heard her own death pronounced. She suffered brain damage, but partially recovered, and briefly outlived Atlas and her youngest daughter, both of whom also died in 1946.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{Citation

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Vulcana and Atlas never married one another, and they billed themselves as brother and sister throughout their careers. They did however have six children together, William, Hedley, Augustus, Arthur, Nora, and Mona (1900 &amp;ndash; 1946).&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt; No scandal erupted, as their secret was not discovered during their lifetimes.

Vulcana did not want her children left with relatives or in orphanages, and insisted on raising them herself.&lt;ref name="Home_Truths" /&gt; Thus, all of her children performed with the Society Athletes as soon as they were old enough.

Nora Roberts would go on to appear in the film ''[[Things to Come]]'' (1936).

==Legacy==
The [[Vulcana Women's Circus]], based in [[Brisbane]], Australia, is named after her.

'''Ålänningens sång''' ([[English language|English]]: "''Song of the Ålander''"; [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: "''Ahvenanmaalaisten laulu''), is the [[national anthem|official anthem]] of the [[Åland|Åland Islands]], an autonomous [[Swedish language|Swedish-speaking]] province of [[Finland]]. Adopted in 1922, the anthem's words are by [[John Grandell]] and the music was composed by [[Johan Fridolf Hagfors]]. The song was first performed during the song festival in Mariehamn 1922. In Åland the song is mostly sung on [[Midsummer's Eve]] and on the National day of Åland in June 9th. The song originally had four verses, but the third verse is omitted for a long time when the song is sung and often when it appears in print.

;Original lyrics

:'''Verse 1'''
:Landet med tusende öar och skär,
:danat ur havsvågors sköte.
:Åland, vårt Åland, vår hembygd det är.
:Dig går vår längtan till möte!

:Forngravars kummel i hängbjörkars skygd
:tälja din tusenårs saga.
:Aldrig förgäta vi fädernas bygd,
:vart vi i fjärrled än draga
:vart vi i fjärrled än draga

:'''Verse 2'''
:Skönt är vårt Åland när fjärdar och sund
:blåna i vårljusa dagar,
:ljuvt är att vandra i skog och i lund,
:i strändernas blommande hagar.

:Midsommarstången mot aftonröd sky
:reses av villiga händer,
:ytterst i utskärens fiskareby
:ungdomen vårdkasar tänder
:ungdomen vårdkasar tänder

:'''Verse 3'''
:Skönt är vårt Åland när vågsvallet yr
:högt mot de mäktiga stupen
:när under stjärnhimlen kyrkfolket styr
:över de islagda djupen.

:Ryter än stormen, i stugornas ro
:spinnrocken sjunger sin visa
:minnet av barndomens hägnande bo
:sönerna lyckligast prisa
:sönerna lyckligast prisa.

:'''Verse 4'''
:Aldrig har åländska kvinnor och män
:svikit sin stam och dess ära;
:ofärd oss hotat, men segervisst än
:frihetens arvsrätt vi bära.

:Högt skall det klinga, vårt svenska språk,
:tala med manande stämma,
:lysa vår väg som en flammande båk,
:visa var vi äro hemma
:visa var vi äro hemma
| 
;English translation

:'''Verse 1'''
:The land of thousand islands and skerries,
:Born from deep beneath the waves
:Åland, our Åland, our home it is
:Thee we long to meet

:Ancient graves beneath the birches
:Tells of our thousand year history
:We will never forget the land of our Fathers
:No matter where we will go
:No matter where we will go

:'''Verse 2'''
:Lovely is our Åland when bays and straits
:Become blue in the bright days of spring
:It's delightful to wander in forest and grove
:In the flowered fields of our shores.

:Midsummer pole to evening red sky
:Is raised by willing hands
:Farthest out in the skerry fisher village
:Beacons are lit by the young
:Beacons are lit by the young

:'''Verse 3'''
:Lovely is our Åland when the froth of waves
:is whirling against the mighty precipice
:When the church folks steer beneath the stars
:Over the icy depths of the sea

:Even when storm roars, in the cottages' peace
:The song of the spinning wheel is sung
:The memory of loving childhood is
:Happily praised by the sons
:Happily praised by the sons

:'''Verse 4'''
:Never have Ålandian women and men
:Let the honour of their tribe down
:Warfare threatened us, but victoriously yet
:We carry the heritage of freedom

:Loudly shall it sound, our Swedish language
:Spoken with an urging voice
:Enlighten our path like a sea mark of flames
:Show us where we belong
:Show us where we belong
