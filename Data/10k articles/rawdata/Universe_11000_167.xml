The ''' 2013 Southern Vietnam and Cambodia blackout''' was a [[power outage]] in the southern region of [[Vietnam]] on 22 May 2013, affecting  millions of people.

==Immediate impact==
Power went off at around 14:14&amp;nbsp;pm ([[UTC]]+7) on 22 May 2013.

==Cause==
A careless move of a truck deployed to plant trees in New [[Bình Dương]] City urban area is the direct cause for the massive power outage in the southern region of Vietnam. When moving a tree on Wednesday afternoon, the truck let the tree bump onto a line in the national power grid (500 KV).

==Effects==
This incident caused a massive blackout in 22 provinces and cities in the South of Vietnam. In fact, there has not been any kind of property insurance for these assets in case of unexpected massive and long outage. It even caused the electricity cut for the capital city of Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnamica.net/accidental-black-out-in-22-southern-provinces-of-vietnam/ Accidental Blackout in 22 Southern Provinces of Vietnam], Vietnamica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/vietnam-power-failure-hits-phnom-penh-26121/ Vietnam Power Failure Hits Phnom Penh], Cambodia Daily.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aplocheilus parvus''''', the '''dwarf panchax''', is a [[species]] of [[Aplocheilidae|killifish]] [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] to [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. This species grows to a length of {{convert|6.3|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Its natural habitats are sheltered fresh and [[brackish water]] tanks, small streams and rivulets overgrown with vegetation. They are rarely use as an aquarium fish.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7039">The '''Baruch Plan''' was a proposal by the [[United States]] government, written largely by [[Bernard Baruch]] but based on the [[Acheson–Lilienthal Report]], to the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]] (UNAEC) during its first meeting in June 1946.  The United States, Great Britain and Canada called for an international organization to regulate atomic energy and [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] responded by asking Undersecretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] and [[David E. Lilienthal]] to draw up a plan.

==Text of plan==

# eliminate from national armaments atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction; and 
# establish effective safeguards by way of inspection and other means to protect complying States against the hazards of violations and evasions

==Reaction==
The US agreed to turn over all of its weapons on the condition that all other countries pledge not to produce them and agree to an adequate system of inspection. The Soviets rejected this plan on the grounds that the United Nations was dominated by the United States and its allies in Western Europe, and could therefore not be trusted to exercise authority over atomic weaponry in an evenhanded manner ([[Kuomintang|Nationalist China]], a [[UN Security Council]] member with [[United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power|veto privileges]], was anti-communist and aligned with the US [[Chinese Civil War|at this time]]). The USSR insisted that America eliminate its own nuclear weapons before considering proposals for a system of controls and inspections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/BaruchPlans U.S. State Department: The Acheson–Lilienthal &amp; Baruch Plans, 1946] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015213809/http://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/BaruchPlans |date=October 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Soviets showed increased interest in the cause of arms control after they became a nuclear power in 1949, and particularly after the death of Stalin in 1953, the issue of the Soviet Union submitting to international inspection was always a thorny one upon which many attempts at nuclear arms control were stalled. Crucially, the Baruch Plan suggested that none of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council would be able to veto a decision to punish culprits. In presenting his plan to the United Nations, Baruch stated:&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Joshua. "[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=17078&amp;prog=zgp&amp;proj=znpp The Quick and the Dead]". Carnegie International Non-Proliferation Conference. June 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We are here to make a choice between the quick and the dead. That is our business. Behind the black portent of the new atomic age lies a hope which, seized upon with faith, can work our salvation. If we fail, then we have damned every man to be the slave of fear. Let us not deceive ourselves; we must elect world peace or (elect) world destruction.}}

The Baruch Plan was not agreed to by the Soviet Union, and though debate on the matter continued until 1948, it was not seriously advanced later than the end of 1947. The USSR was, at the time of the negotiations, pursuing [[Soviet atomic bomb project|their own atomic bomb project]], and the United States was continuing its own weapons development and production. With the failure of the plan, both nations embarked on programs of weapons development, innovation, production, and testing as part of the overall [[nuclear arms race]] of the Cold War.

[[Bertrand Russell]] urged control of nuclear weapons in the 1940s and early 1950s to avoid the likelihood of a general nuclear war, and felt hopeful when the Baruch Proposal was made. In late 1948 he suggested that "the remedy might be the threat of immediate war by the United States on Russia for the purpose of forcing nuclear disarmament on her." Later he thought less well of the Baruch Proposal as "Congress insisted upon the insertion of clauses which it was known that the Russians would not accept."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1944-1967, Volume III |last=Russell |first= Bertrand |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1969 |publisher= [[George Allen and Unwin]] |location= London|isbn=978-0-04-921010-3 |pages=17,18,181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1961 book ''Has Man a Future?'', Russell described the Baruch plan as follows:
{{quote|The United States Government ... did attempt ... to give effect to some of the ideas which the atomic scientists had suggested. In 1946, it presented to the world what is now called "The Baruch Plan", which had very great merits and showed considerable generosity, when it is remembered that America still had an unbroken nuclear monopoly. The Baruch Plan proposed an International Atomic Development Authority which was to have a monopoly of mining [[uranium]] and [[thorium]], refining the ores, owning materials, and constructing and operating plants necessary for the use of nuclear power. It was suggested that this Authority should be established by the United Nations and that the United States should give it the information of which, so far, America was the sole possessor. Unfortunately, there were features of the Baruch Proposal which Russia found unacceptable, as, indeed, was to be expected. It was Stalin's Russia, flushed with pride in the victory over the Germans, suspicious (not without reason) of the Western Powers, and aware that in the United Nations it could almost always be outvoted.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''Has Man a Future?'' [London: Allen and Unwin, 1961], pp. 28-9.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The Baruch Plan is often questioned on whether it was a legitimate effort to achieve global cooperation on nuclear control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://utminers.utep.edu/rcross/lecture_postings.htm The University of Texas at El Paso: Prof. R.P.

In [[physics]], the '''Bethe ansatz''' is an [[ansatz]] method for finding the exact solutions of certain one-dimensional quantum many-body models. It was invented by [[Hans Bethe]] in 1931 to find the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the one-dimensional [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|Heisenberg model]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. Since then the method has been extended to other models in one dimension: [[Bose gas]], [[Hubbard model]], etc.

==Discussion==
In the framework of many-body [[quantum mechanics]], models solvable by the Bethe ansatz can be contrasted with free fermion models. One can say that the dynamics of a free model is one-body reducible: the many-body wave function for [[fermions]] ([[bosons]]) is the anti-symmetrized (symmetrized) product of one-body wave functions. Models solvable by the Bethe ansatz are not free: the two-body sector has a non-trivial [[S-matrix|scattering matrix]], which in general depends on the momenta.

On the other hand, the dynamics of the models solvable by the Bethe ansatz is two-body reducible: the many-body scattering matrix is a product of two-body scattering matrices. Many-body collision happen as a sequence of two-body collisions and the many-body wave function can be represented in a form which contains only elements from two-body wave functions. The many-body scattering matrix is equal to the product of pairwise scattering matrices.

The [[Yang-Baxter equation]] guarantees the consistency. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] is valid for models solvable by the Bethe ansatz, even for models of interacting [[bosons]].

The [[ground state]] is a [[Fermi surface|Fermi sphere]]. [[Periodic boundary conditions]] lead to the Bethe ansatz equations.

'''Challenge X: Crossover to Sustainable Mobility''', known more commonly as '''Challenge X''', is a four-year competition series amongst engineering students from across [[North America]]. Its purpose is to advance vehicle technology towards a goal of [[sustainable development|sustainable]] mobility.

The headline sponsors of the competition are The [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) and [[General Motors]] (GM), and the competition series is managed by [[Argonne National Laboratory|Argonne National Laboratories]] (Argonne). Team evaluation, technical and logistical support is also provided by Argonne. The 2006 – 2007 academic year is the third year of the competition.

A selection process was opened to all accredited engineering programs in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in 2003. Of those schools who submitted proposals to the competition organizers, 17 were chosen as Challenge X participants.

==Competition details==
Challenge X is a continuation of the long history of student vehicle competitions sponsored by the DOE since 1987 (Challenge X a). The majority of the competitions involve high level sponsors from both the government and the automotive industry. Challenge X is the latest in these series of competitions. The goal of the competition is to guide students through the engineering design process used at many automotive manufacturers, while developing and exploring various advanced technologies which can be used to reduce energy consumption and vehicle emissions. The vice president for GM's Powertrain Division, Tom Stephens described the competition by saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the first time that a student competition has emphasized the importance of fuel choice in achieving sustainability mobility. Challenge X provides the student teams an opportunity to take an open-minded well-to-wheels approach to all the issues involved in energy efficiency and emissions – including the fuel source, the propulsion system and the vehicle's real world utility and consumer appeal (Foster).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
When applied properly these technologies lead to more sustainable vehicle solutions. As automotive consumers have increasingly purchased large family sized sport utility vehicles over the past decade, the competition vehicle for Challenge X is the [[Chevrolet Equinox]], a GM a [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] [[crossover SUV]] . Student teams are required to maintain the stock vehicle's performance, safety, utility, and consumer acceptability all while attempting to increase its fuel economy and decrease its emissions.

===Year One===
During the first year of the competition each team focused on vehicle simulation, computerized powertrain simulations, and the ever-present engineering give and take present in early vehicle design. This intensive modeling of each teams proposed vehicle architecture is designed to guide the teams in making decisions about vehicle hardware and components. For example, students must compare the advantages and disadvantages of many components that are able to perform the same function, and when students find that there is not an existing component available to perform a specified function, they must determine if they have to time and/or resources to develop such a component. At the end of the 2004 – 2005 academic year, the first years competition was held in [[Milford, Michigan]]. The focus of the year one competition was the development of an [[alternative fuel]] architecture and the support of models to show a reduction in overall petroleum consumption and a decrease in vehicle emissions. Teams were also judged on technical papers and presentations submitted to competition organizers.

The [[University of Waterloo]] from [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] received first place (Sharp). The Waterloo team's design is a series [[fuel cell]] [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] that uses a Hydrogenics PEM fuel cell engine with a Cobasys 288 [[Volt|V]] NiMH battery and two Ballard 67 [[Watt|kW]] [[Electric motor#AC motors|ACI]] electric drives (Challenge X c). Second place was awarded to the [[University of Akron]] from [[Akron, Ohio]] (Sharp) with their design of a through-the-road parallel hybrid with a 1.9 [[Litre|L]]  [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen]] [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] engine running on [[biodiesel]] (B-20), a Siemens 21&amp;nbsp;kW ACI motor, and a Johnson Controls 165 V battery pack (Challenge X c). Third place was awarded to [[Ohio State University]] from [[Columbus, Ohio]] (Sharp) with their design, also a through-the-road parallel biodiesel hybrid, utilizing a Panasonic NiMH battery and a 1.9 L [[Fiat]] 110&amp;nbsp;kW [[Diesel engine#Indirect injection|CIDI]] engine (Challenge X c). Fourth place went to Virginia Tech (Sharp). Overall, all 17 teams met the minimum goals for the year one competition and were awarded with the donation of a 2005 Chevrolet Equinox to their team.

===Year Two===
The second year of the competition was focused on teams implementing their chosen architecture into their project vehicle. After completing year one, each team was required to continue with their proposed architecture and any major changes to their design, or to the vehicle structure or safety systems had to be approved through a detailed waiver process where the reasons for and ability to make such changes while meeting competition goals are explained to competition organizers. Vehicle integration was the main focus of year two, where teams were required to have a working vehicle by the time of the year end competition. A strong focus was placed on powertrain development and a demonstration of energy use and emissions goals as defined by each team in their year one reports. Each team was also judged extensively on vehicle performance categories such as greenhouse gas impact, total well-to-wheels fuel economy, emissions, towing capacity, acceleration, off-road performance, and consumer acceptability. Furthermore, each team was required to submit a technical paper and perform an oral presentation (Challenge X d).

The year two competition was hosted at the [[GM Desert Proving Grounds]] in [[Mesa, Arizona]]. Top honors in the year two competition went to the first place team [[Virginia Tech]] from [[Blacksburg, Virginia]] (Gurski). Virginia Tech’s competition entry, the REV&lt;sub&gt;LSE&lt;/sub&gt; (Renewable Energy Vehicle, the Larsen Special Edition) is a split parallel hybrid using a Ballard Ranger 67&amp;nbsp;kW ACI rear traction motor, an 8&amp;nbsp;kW MES belted alternator starter, and a Saab 2.0 L[[Flexible-fuel vehicle|Flex Fuel]] SI engine running on [[E85]] – an ethanol/gas blend. Virginia Tech also won first place in lowest well-to-wheels petroleum energy usage, with an overall reduction of petroleum consumption of 74 percent over the stock vehicle, best written technical reports, lowest regulated tailpipe emissions, and lowest time braking and handling (Challenge X b). Second place was awarded to the University of Wisconsin–Madison Hybrid Vehicle Team from [[Madison, Wisconsin]] (Challenge X b) with their Moovada, a through-the-road parallel biodiesel electric running with the 1.9 L Fiat 110-kilowatt CIDI engine (Challenge X c). [[Mississippi State University]] from [[Starkville, Mississippi]] came in third place overall (Challenge X b) also with a through-the-road parallel biodiesel electric running with the 1.9 L Fiat 110&amp;nbsp;kW CIDI engine, and a Ballard Ranger 67&amp;nbsp;kW ACI rear traction motor (Challenge X c). Fourth place went to Ohio State University (Challenge X b).

===Year Three===
Year Three required further refinement of the vehicle with the goal of delivering a “showroom” vehicle that addresses the requirements of consumers.  At the conclusion of years one through three, team vehicles were judged in areas such as towing capacity, acceleration, ride and handling, noise and vibration, greenhouse gas impact, total well-to-wheels fuel economy, and consumer acceptability.

===Year Four===
The competition is currently in year four for the 2007-2008 academic year.  The fourth year of the program will give students the opportunity to further implement innovative technologies in their vehicles, such as telematics, that will help meet consumer demands for safety, security and convenience.  The final year will also allow teams to focus on developing and implementing marketing plans for their vehicles to promote the goals of the Challenge X program.  The year end competition will be a road rally.

'''''Cnidoscolus aconitifolius''''', commonly known as '''chaya''' or '''tree spinach''', is a large, fast-growing leafy [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[shrub]] that is believed to have originated in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Grubben"/&gt; 
The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]], ''aconitifolius'', means "''[[Aconitum]]''-like leaves".  
It has succulent stems which exude a milky sap when cut. It can grow to be 6 meters tall, but is usually pruned to about 2 m for easier leaf harvest. It is a popular [[leaf vegetable]] in [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] and [[Latin American cuisine|Central American cuisine]]s, similar to [[spinach]]. The leaves should be cooked before being eaten, as the raw leaves contain a high content of [[toxic plant|toxic]] hydrocyanic acid. Up to 5 raw leaves can be eaten a day. To be safely eaten, the required cooking time is 5–15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=6jrlyOPfr24C&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;vq=chaya&amp;pg=PA200#v=snippet&amp;q=chaya&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="people.umass.edu"&gt;http://people.umass.edu/psoil370/Syllabus-files/Chaya.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://miraclesinaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Chaya_broch_eng_r2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
''Cnidoscolus aconitifolius'' subsp. ''aconitifolius'' is found from northern Mexico to Guatemala and cultivated as far south as Peru, while ''Cnidoscolus aconitifolius'' subsp. ''polyanthus'' &lt;small&gt;([[Ferdinand Albin Pax|Pax]] and [[Käthe Hoffmann|K.Hoffm.]]) Breckon&lt;/small&gt; is restricted a small area in western Mexico.

Plants in the Chayamansa [[Cultivar group|Group]] (syn. ''Cnidoscolus chayamansa'') are the most widely cultivated, because they lack [[stinging hair]]s on the leaves. It is divided into four cultivars based on leaf morphology: 'Chayamansa' (most common), 'Estrella', 'Picuda', and 'Redonda'.&lt;ref name="Grubben"/&gt;

==Cultivation==
Chaya is easy to grow, a tender perennial in the US, and suffers little [[insect]] damage. It is tolerant of heavy rain and has some [[drought]] tolerance. [[plant propagation|Propagation]] is normally by woody [[Plant stem|stem]] [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]] about 6-12&amp;nbsp;inches long, as seeds are produced only rarely. Early growth is slow as roots are slow to develop on the cuttings, so leaves are not harvested until the second year. Chaya leaves can be harvested continuously as long as no more than 50% of the leaves are removed from the plant, which guarantees healthy new plant growth.

A [[USDA]] study in [[Puerto Rico]] reported that higher yields of greens could be obtained with chaya than any other vegetable they had studied. In another study chaya leaves were found to contain substantially greater amounts of [[nutrients]] than spinach leaves.&lt;ref name="people.umass.edu"/&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Consumption==
Some varieties have [[stinging hair]]s and require gloves for harvesting. Cooking destroys the stinging hairs. Chaya is one of the most productive green vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.echotech.org/technical/az/aztext/azch2veg.htm#Chay&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nzdl.sadl.uleth.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzdl.sadl.uleth.ca/cgi-bin/library?e=d-00000-00---off-0hdl--00-0--0-10-0--0-0---0prompt-10---4------4-0-1l--11-en-50-0--20-about--100-0-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00-0-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;c=hdl&amp;cl=CL3.10&amp;d=HASH01db635e6cefb81dc6e76991.24.3|title=The nutritive value of chaya, one of the most productive green vegetables|work=Ideas for growing food under difficult conditions - From Amaranth to Zai Holes - ECHO / ECHO development notes|issue=53|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211114/http://nzdl.sadl.uleth.ca/cgi-bin/library?e=d-00000-00---off-0hdl--00-0--0-10-0--0-0---0prompt-10---4------4-0-1l--11-en-50-0--20-about--100-0-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00-0-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;c=hdl&amp;cl=CL3.10&amp;d=HASH01db635e6cefb81dc6e76991.24.3|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaya is a good source of [[protein]], [[vitamin]]s, [[calcium]], and [[iron]]; and is also a rich source of [[antioxidant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kuti | first1 = J.

Cooking is essential prior to consumption to inactivate the toxic components; in this chaya is similar to [[cassava]], which also contains toxic hydrocyanic glycosides and must be cooked before being eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/MV045|author=James M Stephens|publisher=University of Florida IFAS Extension|title=Chaya — Cnidoscolus chayamansa McVaugh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young chaya leaves and the thick, tender stem tips are cut and boiled as a spinach. It is a tasty vegetable, and is exceptionally high in protein, calcium, iron, and vitamin A.&lt;ref name="nzdl.sadl.uleth.ca"/&gt; In fact, levels of chaya leaf nutrients are two- to threefold greater than any other land-based leafy green vegetable.&lt;ref name="Kuti"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1996/V3-516.html |first1=Joseph O. |last1=Kuti |first2=Eliseo S. |last2=Torres |title=Potential nutritional and health benefits of tree spinach |pages=516–520 |editor=J.

Traditionally leaves are immersed and simmered for 20 minutes and then served with oil or butter. Cooking for 20 minutes or more will render the leaves safe to eat.  The stock or liquid the leaves are cooked in can also safely be consumed as the cyanide is volatilized as [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN) during cooking.  Cooking in aluminum cookware can result in a toxic broth, causing [[diarrhea]].&lt;ref name="Jensen"/&gt;

'''The Components of Crude Oil'''

Crude oil is essentially a mixture of many different [[hydrocarbon]]s, all of varying lengths and complexities. In order to separate the individual components that make up the raw natural resource, the crude oil must be [[Fractional distillation|fractionally distilled]] so that chemical components can be removed one at a time according to their boiling points.  


a) Light [[Distillate]]s: 
&lt;br/ &gt;i) [[Naphtha]] - Made into [[gasoline]]/[[petrochemical]]s
&lt;br /&gt;ii) Methane Pentane 


b) Middle distillates
&lt;br/ &gt;    i) [[Light gas oil]] - made into [[Jet fuel|jet]]/diesel furnace fuels
&lt;br/ &gt;    ii) [[Heavy gas oil]] - further processing to produce naphtha and other products.
The components of [[crude oil]] are [[petrol]], [[tar]], [[oil]], dissolved gases and kerosene also known as [[petroleum]].


c) Residue
&lt;br/ &gt;    Further processed into refinery fuels, heavy fuel oil, [[wax]]es, [[Grease (lubricant)|greases]], [[asphalt]]s [the lighter the stuff the higher the price]

[[Image:Yuanyang cow pat.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Water buffalo dung drying on the wall of a house, [[Yuanyang County, Yunnan]]]]
[[File:Cow dung cake.jpg|thumb|Mound of cow dung fuel, India]] 
'''Cow dung''', also known as '''cow pats''', '''cow pies''' or '''cow manure''', is the [[waste|waste product]] of [[Bovinae|bovine]] animal species. These species include domestic [[cattle]] ("cows"), [[bison]] ("buffalo"), [[yak]], and [[water buffalo]]. Cow dung is the undigested residue of plant matter which has passed through the animal's gut. The resultant [[feces|faecal matter]] is rich in [[mineral]]s. Color ranges from greenish to blackish, often darkening soon after exposure to [[air]].

==Uses==
Cow dung, which is usually a dark brown color is often used as [[manure]] (agricultural [[fertilizer]]). If not recycled into the soil by species such as earthworms and [[dung beetle]]s, cow dung can dry out and remain on the pasture, creating an area of grazing land which is unpalatable to livestock.

In many parts of the developing world, and in the past in mountain regions of Europe, caked and [[Dry animal dung fuel|dried cow dung]] is used as [[fuel]].

Dung may also be collected and used to produce [[biogas]] to generate [[electricity]] and heat. The gas is rich in [[methane]] and is used in rural areas of India and Pakistan and elsewhere to provide a renewable and stable source of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denmark.dk/en/green-living/sustainable-projects/cow-dung-a-source-of-green-energy/|title=Cow dung – a energy|work=denmark.dk|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In central Africa, [[Maasai people|Maasai]] villages have burned cow dung inside to repel [[mosquito]]s. In cold places, cow dung is used to line the walls of rustic houses as a cheap [[thermal insulation|thermal insulator]]. Most of villagers in India spray fresh cow dung mixed with water in front of the houses to repel insects.&lt;!-- following ref does not mention any of the items in this para (though it does mention insect-repelling external fires in cattle-grazing areas) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilri.org/biometrics/Publication/Full%20Text/cattle%20keeping%20Orma%20people.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; It is also dried into cake like shapes and used as replacement for firewood.

Cow dung is also an optional ingredient in the manufacture of adobe [[mud brick]] housing depending on the availability of materials at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhouse.gov.au/yourhome/technical/fs34d.htm|title=Your Home Technical Manual - 3.4d Construction Systems - Mud Brick (Adobe)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706132354/http://www.greenhouse.gov.au/yourhome/technical/fs34d.htm|archivedate=2007-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A deposit of cow dung is referred to in American English as a "cow chip," or less commonly "cow pie," and in British English as a "cowpat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cowpat|title=Cowpat - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When dry, it is used in the practice of "cow chip throwing" popularized in [[Beaver, Oklahoma]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2188|title=Cow Chip Throwing Capital of the World|work=RoadsideAmerica.com|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beaveroklahoma.net/CowChip.html Town of Beaver, Oklahoma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228165853/http://www.beaveroklahoma.net/CowChip.html |date=2010-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 2001 Robert Deevers of Elgin, Oklahoma, set the record for cow chip throwing with a distance of {{convert|185|ft|5|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amarillo.com/stories/042201/usn_oldchip.shtml|title=Old chip-throw record is tossed - Amarillo.com - Amarillo Globe-News|first=JESSICA|last=RAYNOR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cow dung is also used in Hindu religious fire [[yajna]] as an important ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ayurveda-sedona.com/knowledge-center/spirituality/holy-cow/|title=Holy Cow – Importance of Cow in Hinduism and Sacred Ayurvedic Texts – Sattvic Milk and Dairy Products|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Currently cow dung also used as a making Panchgavya ( combination of five elements ) its used as a agriculture purpose.

==Ecology==
Cow dung provides food for a wide range of animal and fungus species, which break it down and recycle it into the [[food chain]] and into the [[soil]].

In areas where cattle (or other mammals with similar dung) are not native, there are often also no native species which can break down their dung, and this can lead to infestations of pests such as flies and parasitic worms. In [[Australia]], [[dung beetle]]s from elsewhere have been introduced to help recycle the cattle dung back into the soil. (see the [[Australian Dung Beetle Project]] and Dr. [[George Bornemissza]]).&lt;ref name="adbp"&gt;Bornemissza, G. F. (1976), The Australian dung beetle project 1965-1975, ''Australian Meat Research Committee Review'' 30:1-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle have a natural aversion to feeding around their own dung. This can lead to the formation of taller ungrazed patches of heavily fertilized sward. These habitat patches, termed "islets", can be beneficial for many grassland arthropods, including spiders (Araneae) and bugs (Hemiptera). They have an important function in maintaining biodiversity in heavily utilized pastures.&lt;ref name="adkd"&gt;Dittrich, A. D. K. and Helden A. J. 2012. Experimental sward islets: the effect of dung and fertilisation on Hemiptera and Araneae. Insect Conservation and Diversity 5:46-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
A ''buffalo chip'', also called a ''meadow muffin'', is the name for a large, flat, dried piece of [[feces|dung]] deposited by the [[American bison]]. Well dried buffalo chips were among the few things that could be collected and burned on the [[prairie]] and were used by the [[Plains Indians]], [[Emigrant Trail|settlers and pioneers]], and [[Homestead Act|homesteaders]] as a source of cooking heat and warmth.

Bison dung is sometimes referred to by the name ''nik-nik''. This word is a borrowing from the [[Sioux language]] (which probably originally borrowed it from a northern source). In modern Sioux, ''nik-nik'' can refer to the feces of any bovine, including domestic cattle. It has also come to be used, especially in [[Lakota language|Lakota]], to refer to lies or broken promises, analogously to the vulgar English term "[[bullshit]]" as a figure of speech.

'''Cutting fluid''' is a type of [[coolant]] and [[lubrication|lubricant]] [[designed]] specifically for [[metalworking]] processes, such as [[machining]] and stamping. There are various kinds of cutting fluids, which include oils, oil-water [[emulsion]]s, pastes, gels, aerosols (mists), and air or other gases. They may be made from petroleum distillates, [[animal fat]]s, [[plant oil]]s, water and air, or other raw ingredients. Depending on context and on which type of cutting fluid is being considered, it may be referred to as '''cutting fluid''', '''cutting oil''', '''cutting compound''', '''coolant''', or '''lubricant'''.

Most metalworking and machining processes can benefit from the use of cutting fluid, depending on workpiece material. Common exceptions to this are [[cast iron]] and [[brass]], which may be machined dry (though this is not true of all brasses, and any machining of brass will likely benefit from the presence of a cutting fluid).&lt;ref name="Camm1949"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick James Camm|title=Newnes Engineer's Reference Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXxGAAAAMAAJ|year=1949|publisher=George Newnes|page=594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The properties that are sought after in a good cutting fluid are the ability to:
* keep the workpiece at a stable temperature (critical when working to close [[Tolerance (engineering)|tolerance]]s). Very warm is acceptable, but extremely hot or alternating hot-and-cold are avoided.
* maximize the life of the cutting tip by lubricating the working edge and reducing [[Built up edge|tip welding]].
* ensure safety for the people handling it (toxicity, bacteria, fungi) and for the environment upon disposal.
* prevent rust on machine parts and cutters.

==Function==

=== Cooling ===
Metal cutting  generates [[heat]] due to friction and energy lost deforming the material. The surrounding air has low [[thermal conductivity]] (conducts heat poorly) meaning it is a poor coolant. Ambient air cooling is sometimes adequate for light cuts and low duty cycles typical of [[maintenance, repair and operations]] (MRO) or hobbyist work. Production work requires heavy cutting over long time periods and typically produces more heat than air cooling can remove. Rather than pausing production while the tool cools, using liquid coolant removes significantly more heat more rapidly, and can also speed cutting and reduce friction and tool wear.

However, it is not just the tool which heats up but also the work surface. Excessive temperature in the tool or work surface can ruin the [[Tempering (metallurgy)|temper]] of both, soften either to the point of uselessness or failure, burn adjacent material, create unwanted [[thermal expansion]] or lead to unwanted chemical reactions such as [[oxidation]].

=== Lubrication ===
Besides cooling, cutting fluids also aid the cutting process by lubricating the interface between the tool's cutting edge and the chip. By preventing friction at this interface, some of the heat generation is prevented. This lubrication also helps prevent the chips from being welded onto the tool, which would interfere with subsequent cutting.

[[Extreme pressure additive]]s are often added to cutting fluids to further reduce tool wear.

== Delivery methods ==
Every conceivable method of applying cutting fluid (e.g., flooding, spraying, dripping, misting, brushing) can be used, with the best choice depending on the application and the equipment available. For many metal cutting applications the ideal has long been high-pressure, high-volume pumping to force a stream of liquid (usually an oil-water emulsion) directly into the tool-chip interface, with walls around the machine to contain the splatter and a sump to catch, filter, and recirculate the fluid. This type of system is commonly employed, especially in manufacturing. It is often not a practical option for MRO or hobbyist metalcutting, where smaller, simpler machine tools are used. Fortunately it is also not necessary in those applications, where heavy cuts, aggressive [[speeds and feeds]], and constant, all-day cutting are not vital.

As technology continually advances, the flooding paradigm is no longer always the clear winner. It has been complemented since the 2000s by new permutations of liquid, aerosol, and gas delivery, such as minimum quantity lubrication and through-the-tool-tip cryogenic cooling (detailed below).

'''Through-tool coolant''' systems, also known as '''through-spindle coolant''' systems, are systems plumbed to deliver coolant through passages inside the spindle and through the tool, directly to the cutting interface. Many of these are also '''high-pressure coolant''' systems, in which the operating pressure can be hundreds to several thousand [[pounds per square inch|psi]] (1&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;30&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|MPa]])—pressures comparable to those used in [[hydraulic machinery|hydraulic]] circuits. High-pressure through-spindle coolant systems require [[rotary union]]s that can withstand these pressures. [[Drill bit]]s and [[endmill]]s tailored for this use have small holes at the lips where the coolant shoots out. Various types of [[gun drill]]s also use similar arrangements.

==Types==

=== Liquids ===
There are generally three types of liquids: mineral, semi-synthetic, and synthetic. Semi-synthetic and synthetic cutting fluids represent attempts to combine the best properties of oil with the best properties of water by suspending emulsified oil in a water base. These properties include: rust inhibition, tolerance of a wide range of water hardness (maintaining pH stability around 9 to 10), ability to work with many metals, resist thermal breakdown, and environmental safety.&lt;ref&gt;OSHA (1999). [http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/metalworkingfluids/metalworkingfluids_manual.html Metalworking Fluids: Safety and Health Best Practices Manual]. Salt Lake City: U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is a good conductor of heat but has drawbacks as a cutting fluid. It boils easily, promotes rusting of machine parts, and does not lubricate well. Therefore, other ingredients are necessary to create an optimal cutting fluid.

[[Mineral oil]]s, which are petroleum-based, first saw use in cutting applications in the late 19th century. These vary from the thick, dark, sulfur-rich cutting oils used in heavy industry to light, clear oils.

Semi-synthetic coolants, also called ''soluble oil'', are an emulsion or [[microemulsion]] of water with mineral oil. These began to see use in the 1930s. A typical CNC machine tool usually uses emulsified coolant, which consists of a small amount of oil emulsified into a larger amount of water through the use of a detergent.

[[Synthetic chemical|Synthetic]] coolants originated in the late 1950s and are usually water-based.

The official technique to measure oil concentration in cutting fluid samples is manual [[titration]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Byers|first1=J.P.|title=Metalworking Fluids|date=2006|publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 100ml of the fluid under test is titrated with a 0.5M HCl solution to an endpoint of pH 4 and the volume of titrant used to reach the endpoint is used to calculate the oil concentration. This technique is accurate and not affected by fluid contamination, but needs to be performed by trained personnel in a laboratory environment. A hand-held [[refractometer]] is the industrial standard used to determine the mix ratio of water-soluble coolants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fukuta|first1=Mitsuhiro|last2=Yanagisawa|first2=Tadashi|last3=Miyamura|first3=Satoshi|last4=Ogi|first4=Yasuhiro|title=Concentration measurement of refrigerant/refrigeration oil mixture by refractive index|journal=International Journal of Refrigeration|date=2004|volume=27|issue=4|pages=346–352|doi=10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2003.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; that estimates oil concentration from the sample refractive index measured in the [[Brix scale]]. The refractometer allows for in situ measurements of oil concentration within industrial plants. However, contamination of the sample reduces the accuracy of the measure. Other techniques are used to measure the oil concentration in cutting fluids, such as measure of the fluid [[viscosity]], [[density]], and [[ultrasound]] speed. Other test equipment is used to determine such properties as acidity and conductivity.

Others include:
* [[Kerosene]] and [[Isopropyl alcohol|rubbing alcohol]] often give good results when working on aluminium.
* [[WD-40]] and [[3-In-One Oil]] work well on various metals. The latter has a citronella odor; if the odor offends, mineral oil and general-purpose lubricating oils work about the same.
* Way oil (the oil made for machine tool ways) works as a cutting oil. In fact, some screw machines are designed to use one oil as both the way oil and cutting oil. (Most machine tools treat way lube and coolant as separate things that inevitably mix during use, which leads to tramp oil skimmers being used to separate them back out.)
* [[Motor oil]]s have a slightly complicated relationship to machine tools. Straight-weight non-detergent motor oils are usable, and in fact SAE 10 and 20 oils used to be the recommended spindle and way oils (respectively) on manual machine tools decades ago, although nowadays dedicated way oil formulas prevail in commercial machining. While nearly all motor oils can act as adequate cutting fluids in terms of their cutting performance alone, modern multi-weight motor oils with detergents and other additives are best avoided. These additives can present a copper-corrosion concern to brass and bronze, which machine tools often have in their bearings and leadscrew nuts (especially older or manual machine tools).
* [[Dielectric]] fluid is used as a cutting fluid in [[electrical discharge machining|electrical discharge machines]] (EDMs). It is usually [[deionized water]] or a high-[[flash point|flash-point]] kerosene. Intense heat is generated by the cutting action of the electrode (or wire) and the fluid is used to stabilise the temperature of the workpiece, along with flushing any eroded particles from the immediate work area. The dielectric fluid is non-conductive.
* Liquid- (water- or petroleum oil-) cooled water tables are used with the plasma arc cutting (PAC) process.

=== Pastes or gels ===
Cutting fluid may also take the form of a paste or gel when used for some applications, in particular hand operations such as [[drill]]ing and [[taps and dies|tapping]]. In sawing metal with a [[bandsaw]], it is common to periodically run a stick of paste against the blade. This product is similar in form factor to lipstick or beeswax. It comes in a cardboard tube, which gets slowly consumed with each application.

=== Aerosols (mists) ===
Some cutting fluids are used in [[aerosol]] (mist) form (air with tiny droplets of liquid scattered throughout). The main problems with mists have been that they are rather bad for the workers, who have to breathe the surrounding mist-tainted air, and that they sometimes don't even work very well. Both of those problems come from the imprecise delivery that often puts the mist everywhere and all the time except at the cutting interface, during the cut—the one place and time where it's wanted. However, a newer form of aerosol delivery, {{Visible anchor|MQL}} (minimum quantity of lubricant),&lt;ref name="Z"&gt;{{Citation |last=Zelinski |first=Peter |date=2006-08-28 |title=Toward more seamless MQL |journal=Modern Machine Shop |url=http://www.mmsonline.com/articles/toward-more-seamless-mql }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="K"&gt;{{Citation |last=Korn |first=Derek |date=2010-09-24 |title=The many ways Ford benefits from MQL |journal=Modern Machine Shop |url=http://www.mmsonline.com/articles/the-many-ways-ford-benefits-from-mql }}&lt;/ref&gt; avoids both of those problems. The delivery of the aerosol is directly through the flutes of the tool (it arrives directly through or around the [[tipped tool|insert]] itself—an ideal type of cutting fluid delivery that traditionally has been unavailable outside of a few contexts such as [[gun drill]]ing or expensive, state-of-the-art liquid delivery in production milling). MQL's aerosol is delivered in such a precisely targeted way (with respect to both location and timing) that the net effect seems almost like dry machining from the operators' perspective.&lt;ref name="Z"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K"/&gt; The chips generally seem like dry-machined chips, requiring no draining, and the air is so clean that machining cells can be stationed closer to inspection and assembly than before.&lt;ref name="Z"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K"/&gt; MQL doesn't provide much cooling in the sense of heat transfer, but its well-targeted lubricating action prevents some of the heat from being generated in the first place, which helps to explain its success.

=== CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Coolant ===
[[Carbon dioxide]] (chemical formula CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is also used as a [[coolant]]. In this application pressurized liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is allowed to expand and this is accompanied by a drop in temperature, enough to cause a change of phase into a solid. These solid crystals are redirected into the cut zone by either external nozzles or through-the-spindle delivery, to provide temperature controlled cooling of the cutting tool and work piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=2011-09-26 |title=CO2 Cooling System reduces friction |journal=Modern Machine Shop online |url=http://www.mmsonline.com/products/co2-cooling-system-reduces-friction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air or other gases (e.g., nitrogen) ===
Ambient air, of course, was the original machining coolant. Compressed air, supplied through pipes and hoses from an [[air compressor]] and discharged from a nozzle aimed at the tool, is sometimes a useful coolant. The force of the decompressing air stream blows chips away, and the decompression itself has a slight degree of cooling action. The net result is that the heat of the machining cut is carried away a bit better than by ambient air alone. Sometimes liquids are added to the air stream to form a mist (mist coolant systems, [[#Aerosols (mists)|described above]]).

[[Liquid nitrogen]], supplied in pressurized steel bottles, is sometimes used in similar fashion. In this case, boiling is enough to provide a powerful refrigerating effect. For years this has been done (in limited applications) by flooding the work zone. Since 2005, this mode of coolant has been applied in a manner comparable to [[#MQL|MQL]] (with through-the-spindle and through-the-tool-tip delivery). This refrigerates the body and tips of the tool to such a degree that it acts as a "thermal sponge", sucking up the heat from the tool–chip interface.&lt;ref name="Z2"&gt;{{Citation |last=Zelinski |first=Peter |date=2011-01-28 |title=The 400° difference |journal=Modern Machine Shop |volume=83 |issue=10 |url=http://www.mmsonline.com/articles/the-400-difference }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new type of nitrogen cooling is still under patent. Tool life has been increased by a factor of 10 in the milling of tough metals such as [[titanium]] and [[inconel]].&lt;ref name="Z2"/&gt;

Alternatively, using airflow combined with a quick evaporating substance (ex. alcohol, water etc.) can be used as an effective coolant when handling hot pieces that cannot be cooled by alternate methods.

=== Past practice ===
* In 19th-century machining practice, it was not uncommon to use plain water. This was simply a practical expedient to keep the cutter cool, regardless of whether it provided any lubrication at the cutting edge–chip interface. When one considers that [[High speed steel|high-speed steel]] (HSS) had not been developed yet, the need to cool the tool becomes all the more apparent. (HSS retains its hardness at high temperatures; other carbon tool steels do not.) An improvement was soda water ([[sodium bicarbonate]] in water), which better inhibited the rusting of machine slides. These options are generally not used today because more effective alternatives are available.
* [[Lard]] was very popular in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hartness|1915}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WbZKAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=james%20hartness%20flat%20turret%20lathe%20manual&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pp. 153–155].&lt;/ref&gt; It is used infrequently today, because of the wide variety of other choices, but it remains an option.
* Old machine shop training texts speak of using [[Lead tetroxide|red lead]] and [[white lead]], often mixed into lard or lard oil. This practice is obsolete due to the toxicity of lead.
* From the mid-20th century to the 1990s, [[1,1,1-Trichloroethane|1,1,1-trichloroethane]] was used as an additive to make some cutting fluids more effective. In shop-floor slang it was referred to as "one-one-one". It has been phased out because of its [[Ozone depletion|ozone-depleting]] and [[central nervous system]]-depressing properties.

==Safety concerns==
Cutting fluids present some mechanisms for causing illness or injury in workers.&lt;ref name=hhe&gt;NIOSH (2007). [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/reports/pdfs/2005-0227-3049.pdf Health hazard evaluation and technical assistance report: HETA 005-0227-3049], Diamond Chain Company, Indianapolis, Indiana.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chemical hazard|Occupational exposure]] is associated with increases in [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="SBU2017"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbu.se/en/publications/sbu-assesses/occupational-health-and-safety--chemical-exposure/|title=Occupational health and safety – chemical exposure|publisher=[[Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services]] (SBU)|website=www.sbu.se|language=en|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms are based on the external (skin) or internal contact involved in machining work, including touching the parts and tooling; being splattered or splashed by the fluid; or having mist settle on the skin or enter the mouth and nose in the normal course of [[breathing]].

The mechanisms include the chemical toxicity or physical irritating ability of:
* the fluid itself
* the metal particles (from previous cutting) that are borne in the fluid
* the [[bacteria]]l or [[fungus|fungal]] populations that naturally tend to grow in the fluid over time
* the [[biocide]]s that are added to inhibit those life forms
* the [[corrosion inhibitor]]s that are added to protect the machine and tooling
* the [[#Tramp oil|tramp oils]] that result from the way oils (the lubricants for the slideways) inevitably finding their way into the coolant

The toxicity or irritating ability is usually not high, but it is sometimes enough to cause problems for the skin or for the tissues of the [[respiratory tract]] or [[alimentary tract]] (e.g., the mouth, larynx, esophagus, trachea, or lungs).

Some of the diagnoses that can result from the mechanisms explained above include [[irritant contact dermatitis]]; [[allergic contact dermatitis]]; [[occupational acne]]; [[tracheitis]]; [[esophagitis]]; [[bronchitis]]; [[asthma]]; [[allergy]]; [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]] (HP); and worsening of pre-existing respiratory problems.

Safer cutting fluid formulations provide a resistance to tramp oils, allowing improved filtration separation without removing the base additive package. [[HVAC|Room ventilation]], splash guards on machines, and [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) (such as [[safety glasses]], [[respirator]] masks, and [[glove#Commercial and industrial|gloves]]) can mitigate hazards related to cutting fluids.&lt;ref name=niosh&gt;NIOSH (1998). [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/98-102.html Criteria for a recommended standard: occupational exposure to metalworking fluids]. Cincinnati, OH: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. DHHS (NIOSH) Pub. No. 98-102.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Skimmers may be used to remove tramp oil from the surface of cutting fluid, which prevents the growth of micro-organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oil-skimmers.co.uk/|title=Tramp Oil Skimmers {{!}} Belt, Disc Oil Skimmers {{!}} SKIM IT|website=Oil Skimmers|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bacteria]]l growth is predominant in petroleum-based cutting fluids. Tramp oil along with human hair or skin oil are some of the debris during cutting which accumulates and forms a layer on the top of the liquid; anaerobic bacteria proliferate due to a number of factors. An early sign of the need for replacement is the "Monday-morning smell" (due to lack of usage from Friday to Monday). [[Antiseptic]]s are sometimes added to the fluid to kill bacteria. Such use must be balanced against whether the antiseptics will harm the cutting performance, workers' health, or the environment. Maintaining as low a fluid temperature as practical will slow the growth of microorganisms.&lt;ref name=niosh /&gt;

==Degradation, replacement, and disposal==
{{Anchor|Tramp oil}}
Cutting fluids degrade over time due to contaminants entering the lubrication system. A common type of degradation is the formation of ''tramp oil'', also known as ''sump oil'', which is unwanted oil that has mixed with cutting fluid.&lt;ref name="Smid2010p114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smid|2010|p=114}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It originates as [[lubrication]] oil that seeps out from the [[slideway]]s and washes into the coolant mixture, as the protective film with which a steel supplier coats [[bar stock]] to prevent rusting, or as [[hydraulic fluid|hydraulic]] oil leaks. In extreme cases it can be seen as a film or skin on the surface of the coolant or as floating drops of oil.

[[Skimmer (machine)|Skimmer]]s are used to separate the tramp oil from the coolant. These are typically slowly rotating vertical discs that are partially submerged below the coolant level in the main reservoir. As the disc rotates the tramp oil clings to each side of the disc to be scraped off by two wipers, before the disc passes back through the coolant. The wipers are in the form of a channel that then redirects the tramp oil to a container where it is collected for disposal. Floating [[weir]] skimmers are also used in these situation where temperature or the amount of oil on the water becomes excessive.

Since the introduction of CNC additives, the tramp oil in these systems can be managed more effectively through a continuous separation effect. The tramp oil accumulation separates from the aqueous or oil based coolant and can be easily removed with an absorbent.

Old, used cutting fluid must be disposed of when it is fetid or chemically degraded and has lost its usefulness. As with used motor oil or other wastes, its impact on the environment should be mitigated. Legislation and regulation specify how this mitigation should be achieved. Modern cutting fluid disposal involves techniques such as [[ultrafiltration]] using polymeric or ceramic membranes which concentrates the suspended and emulsified oil phase.

[[Swarf|Chip]] handling and coolant management are interrelated. Over the decades they have been improved, to the point that many metalworking operations now use engineered solutions for the overall cycle of collecting, separating, and recycling both chips and coolant. For example, the chips are graded by size and type, tramp metals (such as bolts and scrap parts) are separated out, the coolant is centrifuged off the chips (which are then dried for further handling), and so on.&lt;ref name="Willcutt"&gt;{{Citation |last=Willcutt_2015-06-18 |first=Russ |date=2015-06-18 |title=When the chips are down |journal=[[Modern Machine Shop]] |url=http://www.mmsonline.com/blog/post/when-the-chips-are-down |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1317">'''DSF Refractories and Minerals Limited''' is the last major British producer of refactories, specializing in specialist shaped and unshaped [[refractory]] products. DSF is located in [[Friden, Derbyshire|Friden]] within the Derbyshire's Peak National Park.

DSF also a processor and supplier of crushed and graded refractory raw materials for other applications such as coloured road-stone.

DSF was established in 1993 following the receivership of DSF Refractories Ltd and its parent company BH-F.

British Hartford-Fairmont Ltd 'BH-F' had owned the company since 1987. They acquired DSF to support their business in the [[glass]] industry from West Group International 'WGI' who had as West Gas Improvement formed the company in 1892 as Derbyshire Silica Firebrick Ltd to support WGI's gas development business by the manufacture of refractories for use in the production of town gas. By the 1960s, the business diversified into supplying other industries including steel, glass and cement.

'''Design for lean manufacturing''' is a process for applying lean concepts to the design phase of a system, such as a complex product or process. The term describes methods of design in [[lean manufacturing]] companies as part of the study of Japanese industry by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  At the time of the study, the Japanese automakers were outperforming the American counterparts in speed, resources used in design, and design quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Womack|first=James|author2=Jones, Daniel T.|author3=Roos, Daniel|title=The Machine That Changed the World: The Story of Lean Production, Toyota's Secret Weapon in the Global Car Wars That Is Now Revolutionizing World Industry|year=1990|publisher=Free Press: Simon and Schuster, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-7432-9979-4|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional [[mass-production]] design focuses primarily on product functions and manufacturing costs; however,design for  lean manufacturing systematically widens the design equation to include all factors that will determine a product's success across its entire [[Value stream mapping|value stream]] and life-cycle.  One goal is to reduce waste  and maximize value, and other goals include improving the quality of the design and the reducing the time to achieve the final solution. The method has been used in architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Czap|first=Michael F.|title=Lean Architecture: The pursuit of Excellence in Project Delivery|url=http://www.aia.org/practicing/groups/kc/AIAB080130|work=The American Institute of Architects|publisher=AIA|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; healthcare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stouffer|first=Jeffery|title=Lean Design: What's it All About|url=http://www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com/blogs/hks-inc/lean-design-what-s-it-all-about|work=Health Care Design Magazine|publisher=Vendome Healthcare Media|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; product development, processes design, information technology systems, and even to create lean business models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ries|first=Eric|title=The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses|year=2011|publisher=Crown Publishing Group, Random House|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-307-88789-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on the definition and optimization of values coupled with the prevention of wastes before they enter the system. Design for lean manufacturing is [[system design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Allen, C. PhD|title=Lean Product and Process Development|year=2009|publisher=The Lean Enterprise Institute|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-934109-13-7|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Not to be confused with "Lean Design" (copyrighted and patented by Munro &amp; Associates, of Michigan), design for lean manufacturing builds on the set of principles that emerged from design for the customer value and [[design for manufacturability]].  Since some lean tools are used in the practice of design for lean manufacturing, it borrows the first word in its name from [[lean manufacturing]] as exemplified by the [[Toyota Production System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liker|first=Jeffery|title=The Toyota Way: 14 Management Principles from the World's Greatest Manufacturer|year=2004|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780071392310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Design for lean manufacturing was first coined by Womack, Jones, and Roos after studying the differences between conventional development at American automotive companies and lean methods at Japanese automobile producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Womack|first=James|title=The Machine That Changed the World: The Story of Lean Production, Toyota's Secret Weapon in the Global Car Wars That Is Now Revolutionizing World Industry|year=1990|publisher=Free Press: Simon and Schuster, Inc.|location=New York, NY|pages=112–130|isbn=978-0-7432-9979-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While lean manufacturing focuses on optimization of the production stream and removal of wastes (commonly referred to as [[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]], [[Mura (Japanese term)|mura]], and [[Muri (Japanese term)|muri]]) once the value stream has been created, Lean Design ® (Munro &amp; Associates)concerns itself with methods and techniques to create a lean solution from the start, resulting in more value and fewer wastes across the value stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huthwaite|first=Bart, Sr.|title=The Rules of Innovation|year=2007|publisher=Huthwaite Innovation Institute|location=Mackinac Island, MI|isbn=978-0-9712210-4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lean design ® seeks to optimize the development process through rapid [[learning cycle]]s to build and test multiple concepts early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schipper, Timothy|last-author-amp=yes|author2=Swets, Mark|title=Innovative Lean Development: How to Create, Implement, and Maintain a Learning Culture Using Fast Learning Cycles|year=2010|publisher=Taylor and Francis, LLC|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4200-9298-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Managing the knowledge value stream, systematic [[problem solving]] with analysis of the trade-offs between various design options,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Allen, PhD.|title=Lean Product and Process Development|year=2007|publisher=Lean Enterprise Institute|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-934109-13-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and solutions generated from ideas filtered by systematic [[innovation]] methods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huthwaite|first=Bart, Sr.|title=The Lean Design Solution: A Practical Guide to Streamlining Design and Development|year=2004|publisher=Huthwaite Innovation Institute|location=Mackinac Island, MI|isbn=978-0-9712210-3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; are viewed as methods within the lean design process.

==Design for lean manufacturing overview ==
Design for lean manufacturing is based on the premise that product and process design is an ongoing activity and not a one-time activity; therefore design for lean manufacturing should be viewed as a long term strategy for an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schipper, Timothy|last-author-amp=yes|author2=Swets, Mark|title=Innovative Lean Development: How to Create, Implement, and Maintain a Learning Culture Using Fast Learning Cycles|year=2010|publisher=Taylor and Francis, LLC|location=New York, NY|pages=136–137|isbn=978-1-4200-9298-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Design for lean manufacturing must be sustainable and holistic unlike other lean manufacturing or [[Six Sigma]] approaches that either tackle only a part of the problem or tackle the problem for a short period of time. Design for lean manufacturing also relates to [[system thinking]] as it considers all aspects (or the full circle) and takes the system conditions into consideration when designing products and services, delivering them according to customer needs.  ® (Munro &amp; Associates) drives prevention of waste by adopting a systematic process to improve the design phase during development. An organizational focus is required for the implementation of Lean Design ® principles, which includes efficient and sustainable design team.  Initial studies of the Japanese approach to design for lean manufacturing noted four principles; leadership of projects by a shusa (or project boss), tightly knit teams, communication on all of the difficult design trade-offs, and simultaneous development between engineering and manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Womack|first=James|author2=Jones, Daniel T.|author3=Roos, Daniel|title=The Machine that Changed the World|year=1991|publisher=1st HarperPerennial|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-06-097417-6|pages=112–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further study showed additional depth to the principles, citing 13 principles specific to the [[Toyota]] design for lean manufacturing methods in product and process development in the areas of process, skilled people, and tools and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan,|first=James|author2=Liker, Jeffery|title=The Toyota Product Development System|year=2006|publisher=Productivity Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-56327-282-2|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the practice of design for lean manufacturing has expanded in its depth and breadth of application, additional principles have been integrated into the method.

== Design for lean manufacturing and development principles ==
* Multiple viewpoints are considered in Design for lean manufacturing.  These are called out as four value streams; customer, product design and test, production, and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radeka|first=Katherine|title=The Mastery of Innovation|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press, Taylor and Francis|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1-4398-7702-9|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Alternately, others name four domains; design, supply, manufacturing, and customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huthwaite|first=Bart|title=The Lean Design Solution|year=2004|publisher=Institute of Lean Innovation|location=Mackinac Island, MI|isbn=0-9712210-3-0|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of the names, focus on the four areas helps developers to think about the value in the solution and the wastes that can enter the system.
* The design for lean manufacturing equation is design for lean manufacturing success = strategic values minus the drivers of design and process wastes.  A good design is one that simultaneously reduces waste and delivers value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huthwaite|first=Bart|title=The Lean Design Solution|year=2004|publisher=Institute of Lean Innovation|location=Mackinac Island, MI|isbn=0-9712210-3-0|pages=27–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radeka|first=Katherine|title=The Mastery of Innovation|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press, Taylor and Francis|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1-4398-7702-9|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are multiple drivers that cause product, process, and lifecycle wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huthwaite|first=Bart|title=The Lean Design Solution|year=2004|publisher=Institute of Lean Innovation|location=Mackinac Island, MI|isbn=0-9712210-3-0|pages=58–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A product is more than the sum of its parts. It’s also the sum of the lifecycle processes needed to design, manufacture and use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huthwaite|first=Bart|title=The Lean Design Solution|year=2004|publisher=Institute of Lean Innovation|location=Mackinac Island, MI|isbn=0-9712210-3-0|pages=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lifecycle of any product is from creation to disposal, from “[[Cradle-to-cradle design|cradle-to-cradle]]”.
* Design for lean manufacturing is recognized as being everybody’s job. A big challenge is making sure everyone understands their lean design ® job descriptions and how each subsystem contributes to the higher level system.  It centers around functions and modules within the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Morgan, James|author2=Liker, Jeffery|title=The Toyota Product Development System|year=2006|publisher=Productivity Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-56327-282-2|pages=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huthwaite|first=Bart|title=The Lean Design Solution|year=2004|publisher=Institute of Lean Innovation|location=Mackinac Island, MI|isbn=0-9712210-3-0|pages=182–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sub-teams achieve flow through rapid learning cycles which quickly move from planning, designing, building, and testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schipper, Timothy|last-author-amp=yes|author2=Swets, Mark|title=Innovative Lean Development: How to Create, Implement, and Maintain a Learning Culture Using Fast Learning Cycles|year=2010|publisher=Taylor and Francis, LLC|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4200-9298-1|pages=31–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Learning cycles by sub-teams working on sub-systems are tied together with integration events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schipper, Timothy|last-author-amp=yes|author2=Swets, Mark|title=Innovative Lean Development: How to Create, Implement, and Maintain a Learning Culture Using Fast Learning Cycles|year=2010|publisher=Taylor and Francis, LLC|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4200-9298-1|pages=61–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most lean manufacturing tools can be directly used by a design for lean manufacturing team. Applying design for lean manufacturing does not make obsolete any existing product design tool, technique or method. Design for lean manufacturing helps a team “knit together” existing tools.  For example, the following methods and business tools can be used by organizations within the design for lean manufacturing methodology: [[Value stream mapping|Value Stream Mapping]], [[Six Sigma|Design for Six Sigma]], [[Visual Control]], [[Quality function deployment|QFD]], [[DFMA]], and [[Taguchi]] methods.
* Savings from applying lean to design are hard to predict. Most of the savings will appear only in the sometimes-distant future. Predicting “hidden cost” savings is extremely difficult and questionable given the time it would require.
* Lean measures both the process of design and the design results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huthwaite|first=Bart, Sr.|title=The Lean Design Solution: A Practical Guide to Streamlining Design and Development|year=2004|publisher=Huthwaite Innovation Institute|location=Mackinac Island, MI|isbn=978-0-9712210-3-1|pages=253–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Measures drive the design for lean manufacturing culture and promote continuous improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radeka|first=Katherine|title=The Mastery of Innovation|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press, Taylor and Fracis|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1-4398-7702-9|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Toyota’s [[lean product development]] process is elusive but not impossible to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Allen, C. PhD|title=Lean Product and Process Development|year=2009|publisher=The Lean Enterprise Institute|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-934109-13-7|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot be imported in parts as is the case with the [[Toyota Production System]].

== The dimensions of lean in design and development ==
To be successful, a corporate wide design for lean manufacturing implementation typically includes the following dimensions:
# Optimization of product value for the operational value stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Allen, C. PhD|title=Lean Product and Process Development|year=2009|publisher=The Lean Enterprise Institute|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-934109-13-7|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Prevention of waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Allen, C. PhD|title=Lean Product and Process Development|year=2009|publisher=The Lean Enterprise Institute|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-934109-13-7|pages=40–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Real-time or predictive measurements &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huthwaite|first=Bart|title=The Lean Design Solution|year=2004|publisher=Institute of Lean Innovation|location=Mackinac Island, MI|isbn=0-9712210-3-0|pages=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Product and process accountability throughout the value stream
# Systematic innovation and problem solving&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radeka|first=Katherine|title=The Mastery of Innovation|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press, Taylor and Fracis|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1-4398-7702-9|pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Stakeholder collaboration between functions
# Team leadership  by a chief engineer or entrepreneurial system designer &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Allen, C. PhD|title=Lean Product and Process Development|year=2009|publisher=The Lean Enterprise Institute|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-934109-13-7|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Senior management support

When the dimensions are fully deployed in an organization, design for lean manufacturing enhances the performance levels with respect to design and innovation. Shingo assessments measure lean implementations in all parts of the organization, including the design methodology.   The [[Shingo Prize for Excellence in Manufacturing]] is given annually for operational excellence in North America. Using design for lean manufacturing practices helps organizations move toward Shingo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=And the Shingo Goes to ...|journal=Business Week: 38b|date=15 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; excellence.

'''Electro-Harmonix''' is a [[New York City|New York]]-based company that makes high-end electronic audio processors and sells [[rebranding|rebranded]] [[vacuum tube]]s. The company was founded by Mike Matthews in 1968. It is best known for a series of popular guitar [[effects pedal]]s introduced in the 1970s and 1990s. Unknown to most people, EH also made a line of guitars in the 70's.&lt;ref&gt;https://electroharmonix.vintageusaguitars.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-1970s, Electro Harmonix had established itself as a pioneer and leading manufacturer of guitar effects pedals. Electro-Harmonix was the first company to introduce, manufacture, and market affordable state-of-the art "stomp-boxes" for guitarist and bassists, such as the first stomp-box [[Flanging|flanger]] ('''Electric Mistress'''), the first analog [[Delay (audio effect)|echo/delay unit]] with no moving parts ('''Memory Man'''), the first guitar synthesizer in pedal form ('''Micro Synthesizer'''), and the first [[valve amplifier|tube-amp]] [[distortion (music)|distortion]] simulator ('''Hot Tubes'''). In 1980, Electro-Harmonix also designed and marketed one of the first digital delay/looper pedals ('''16-Second Digital Delay''') and a line of guitars in the 70's.

== Company history ==

=== Founding years (1967–1968) ===
Electro-Harmonix was founded by [[rhythm and blues]] keyboard player Mike Matthews in October 1968 in [[New York City]] with $1,000&lt;ref name="Youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGWbjDCrwJM |title=Mike Matthews Reveals Business Secrets |publisher=Craom's New York Business |date=2017-05-17 |accessdate=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He took a job as a salesman for [[IBM]] in 1967, but shortly afterwards, in partnership with Bill Berko, an audio repairman who claimed to have his own custom circuit for a fuzz pedal, he jobbed construction of the new pedal to a contracting house and began distributing the pedals under a deal with the [[Guild Guitar Company]]. Fuzzboxes were in demand following a trail of hits involving their sound, including "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]" by [[The Rolling Stones]] two years before, and recent popularization of [[Jimi Hendrix]]. The latter connection resulted in the pedals being branded the 'Foxey Lady'. In addition several low priced models of acoustic guitars were sold.

Following the departure of his partner, Matthews was introduced to inventor and electric engineer Robert Myer through IBM colleagues. Together they designed a circuit to create a distortion-free sustain. A simple line booster used by Myers in testing to preamplify the guitar's signal was also manufactured from 1969 as the Linear Power Booster ('''LPB-1'''), and has continued production in present day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ehx.com/products&lt;/ref&gt;

===First products===
The '''Axis''' fuzz pedal, also sold under the name 'Foxey Lady' for the Guild guitar company, and '''LPB-1''' Linear Power Booster were the first products in 1969. The LPB-1 massively boosted a guitar signal to provide gain by clipping the signal, resulting in a raw distorted sound, full of sustain and harmonics. Several similar devices, which sold well, followed, such as the '''[[treble booster|Treble Booster]]''' and '''Bass Booster'''.
The '''Mike Matthews Freedom Amp''', a portable guitar amp powered by 40 "D" batteries, was popular in many venues that lacked an A/C power source.

=== Change of direction ===
[[Image:Kt88 power tubes in traynor yba200 amplifier.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Electro-Harmonix Tubes (KT88)]]

Electro-Harmonix stopped making pedals in the mid-1980s, and in the early 1990s started selling [[vacuum tube]]s re-branded with its name for guitar amplifiers, which it had also been making since the 1970s. However, due to demand and the high prices guitarists were paying for old 1970s pedals on the [[Vintage musical equipment|vintage market]], it reissued the more popular old pedals in the mid-1990s, including the '''Big Muff Pi''' and '''Small Stone'''. In 2002 it started designing new pedals to add to its range. Company policy was that all reissued effects remained as close as possible to the original, vintage designs; however, casings, knobs and especially the old-fashioned mini-jack power plug were not up to later standards. In 2006 the smaller and more standardized "micro" and "nano" effect lines using [[surface-mount]] circuit components were introduced. [[Printed circuit|Circuit board]] manufacture was [[Outsourcing|outsourced]], and the pedals assembled in New York.

== Effects pedals ==

[[File:Electro-harmonix 12AX7EH.JPG|thumb|Electro-Harmonix 12AX7EH vacuum tube used in a [[Preamplifier|preamp]].]] Electro-Harmonix produces pedals with many different types of sound manipulation suitable for guitar, bass, vocal, keyboard, and other instruments. It also sells rebranded vacuum tubes carrying the Electro-Harmonix brand name.

=== Big Muff ===
[[Image:TwoBigMuffsoriginal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|NYC &amp; a Russian Sovtek re-issued versions]]
{{Main article|Big Muff}}

In 1969 Bob Myer and Mike Matthews designed the '''[[Big Muff|Big Muff Pi]]''', a [[Distortion (music)|fuzzbox]] that added a bass-heavy sustain to any guitar sound. It is described by the company as "the finest harmonic distortion-sustain device developed to date". Originally this was intended to be a pedal that would mimic the fuzz tones of Jimi Hendrix and other guitarists at the time, but the result was a mix of a fuzz and distortion pedal with a very heavy sound.&lt;ref name="kitrae.net"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.kitrae.net/music/big_muff_history.html#TriangleBigMuff |title=The Big Muff History of All Versions Part 1 |publisher=Kitrae.net |date=1970-09-25 |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also made small amps sound much better{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} and allowed distortion at any volume.

The pedal sold well and was used by [[Carlos Santana]], [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[David Gilmour]], [[Alex Lifeson]] of [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and, later, [[Metallica]]'s bassist [[Cliff Burton]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], and in the 1990s [[KoRn]]'s rhythm guitarist [[Munky]], Vicente Freitas, [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] of [[The White Stripes]], [[J Mascis]] of [[Dinosaur Jr.]], [[The Edge]] of [[U2]], and Billy Corgan (on The Smashing Pumpkins landmark album, ''Siamese Dream'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.kitrae.net/music/big_muff_op_amp_history.html#Version4 |title=The Big Muff History of All Versions Part 1 |publisher=Kitrae.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band [[Mudhoney]] titled their debut EP ''[[Superfuzz Bigmuff]]''.

Although the first Big Muff production date was for many years cited as 1971, the first version of the Big Muff was actually sold in 1969 as a hand-made "perf board" version. A production version with an etched PCB board was made in early 1970.&lt;ref name="kitrae.net"/&gt; Mike Matthews was friends with Jimi Hendrix and claims Jimi bought one from Manny's Music in New York, shortly after they were released and had one in the Electric Lady Studios shortly before Jimi's death in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.kitrae.net/music/Jimi_Hendrix_Big_Muff.html |title=Jimi Hendrix Big Muff |publisher=Kitrae.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several variations of the Big Muff Pi followed throughout the 1970s. {{As of|2012}} Electro-Harmonix produced a reissue assembled in [[New York City]]; until 2009 it produced a version made by Sovtek in [[Russia]] which provided a slightly different tone. The '''Bass Big Muff''' replaced the Russian version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.kitrae.net/music/big_muff_history3.html#BassBigMuff |title=The Big Muff History of All Versions 3 |publisher=Kitrae.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other variations (some of which are not actually Big Muffs) of the pedal were in production {{As of|2012|lc=on}}, including the '''Metal Muff''' (intended to achieve the higher gain Metal guitar sound), the '''Double Muff''', which incorporates the original Muff Fuzz circuit, twice in series with a single overdrive control for each circuit, providing the user either with a cascaded 'Double Muff' sound or the original Muff Fuzz circuit, the '''Little Big Muff''', a smaller version, and a variation in circuit, of the NYC Big Muff, which produces yet another variation in sound, and the Big Muff with Tone Wicker, which is similar to the 2008 revision '''NYC Big Muff''', with two added features: a tone bypass switch allowing you to bypass the tone control and a switch that adjusts the frequency of three high frequency filters in the circuit.

In 2018, Electro-Harmonix released three vintage Big Muff re-issues the '''Green Russian Big Muff''', the '''Op-Amp Big Muff''', and the '''Triangle Big Muff'''

=== Phasers, chorus and flanger ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
[[Image:Small Clone Chorus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Small Clone chorus pedal]]

Electro-Harmonix often produces a range of pedals based on a single effect, and then combines two or more into higher end units. For instance, the Epitome combines the MIcro POG, Stereo Electric Mistress, and Holy Grail Plus into one effect unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ehx.com/products/epitome|title=EHX.com {{!}} Epitome - Multi Effect {{!}} Electro-Harmonix|website=www.ehx.com|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widely used '''Small Stone''' [[Phaser (effect)|phase shifter]] is a 4-stage phaser designed by David Cockerell, whom Electro-Harmonix hired from his former employer [[Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd|EMS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedalarea.com/small_stone.htm Small Stone history]&lt;/ref&gt;  The phased sounds of French composer [[Jean-Michel Jarre]] depended heavily on the Small Stone unit. It was reissued years later by EHX and a smaller version of the pedal was eventually introduced in a 'Nano' casing (officially called the "Small Stone (Nano Chassis)").

The '''Small Clone''' [[Chorus effect|chorus]] is a very popular chorus pedal, used by [[Kurt Cobain]], both live and in studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/archive-definitive-kurt-cobain-gear-guide?page=1|title=The Definitive Kurt Cobain Gear Guide|date=2016-02-20|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the Small Stone, it is issued in both the standard size and two different smaller versions (the Nano Clone is based on the Clone Theory circuit, while the neo clone is the standard).

The '''Electric Mistress''' is an analog [[flanger]]. It had first been sold in 1976 and was by that the first flanger in pedal format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metzgerralf.de/elekt/stomp/mistress/electric-mistress-history.shtml History of the Electric Mistress]&lt;/ref&gt; The Deluxe version has been reissued and is still in production, although in 2015, a new '''Deluxe Electric Mistress''' was introduced in the company's smaller "XO" casing. As well, there are two digital recreations called '''NEO Mistress''' and '''Stereo Electric Mistress'''. Except for the very first blue/red version the Electric Mistress featured a "Filter Matrix mode" which allowed the user to freeze it at any point in the flange, offering distinctive chime-like tones. On the Neo and Stereo Mistress, this is achieved at a certain setting on the "rate" knob. Notable users include [[David Gilmour]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Alex Lifeson]], [[Robin Trower]], [[Andy Summers]] of [[The Police]], [[J Mascis]] of [[Dinosaur Jr.]] and ex-[[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarist [[John Frusciante]].

The '''Flanger Hoax''' pedal is a more advanced unit, allowing further control of the various parameters of phaser, flanger and chorusing effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ehx.com/products/flanger-hoax|title=EHX.com {{!}} Flanger Hoax - Phaser/Flanger Modulator {{!}} Electro-Harmonix|website=www.ehx.com|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Polychorus''' allows highly adjustable chorus, flanger, filter matrix, and slapback echo effects.  Notable users include Cobain (i.e. [[Radio Friendly Unit Shifter]]), [[Adrian Belew]], and more recently [[Ryan Jarman]] of [[The Cribs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ehx.com/products/stereo-polychorus|title=EHX.com {{!}} Stereo Polychorus - Analog Chorus/Flanger/Slapback Echo {{!}} Electro-Harmonix|website=www.ehx.com|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electro-Harmonix's 'XO' line added the '''Stereo Polyphase''', an analog optical envelope- and [[low frequency oscillator|LFO]]-controlled [[Phaser (effect)|phase shifter]].

=== Delays and loopers ===
Electro-Harmonix also manufactures delay pedals, including the '''Deluxe Memory Man''', '''Stereo Memory Man''' with Hazarai, and '''#1 Echo'''. They also produce the '2880' pedal, which allows complex looping and multi-track overdubbing. The #1 Echo provides basic digital echo capability, while the Deluxe Memory Man provides more control over length, repeats, etc. The Deluxe Memory Man also includes built-in chorusing and vibrato effects. The digital Stereo Memory Man with Hazarai (distinct from the Analog Deluxe Memory Man) also includes reverse echo effect and looping/overdubbing. The '''Memory Toy''' and '''Memory Boy''' delay pedals are essentially smaller budget versions of the Deluxe Memory Man. The Memory Man effects pedal was used by Edge from the band U2 to record the songs "I Will Follow" and "Sunday Bloody Sunday". One of the singles from the band [[Deerhunter (band)|Deerhunter]]'s 2010 album [[Halcyon Digest]] was named "[[Memory Boy]]".

=== Reverb ===
The '''Holy Grail''', '''Holy Grail Plus''', '''Holier Grail''' (discontinued), '''Holiest Grail''' (discontinued), '''Oceans 11''', and '''Cathedral''' pedals produce reverberation. These cover a range of capability, including reverb length, room simulation, etc. The company's '''Holy Stain''' multi-effects pedal also includes two different types of reverb.

=== Tremolo and Vibrato ===
Tremolo and vibrato are included as well, in both [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] and [[vacuum tube]] options. These are available in the '''Stereo Pulsar''' (solid-state) and '''Wiggler''' (tube) pedals.

=== Octave, pitch and synthesizer ===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:222614jpg.jpg|thumb|right|180px]|The Micro Synthesizer Pedal|{{deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 20 March 2009}}]] --&gt;
Also available are a series of pitch modulation pedals. These include the '''Micro Synthesizer''' (for bass or guitar),  '''HOG''' (Harmonic Octave Generator), '''POG''' (Polyphonic Octave Generator, released in 2005), '''POG 2''' (2009), '''Micro POG''' (in an XO casing), '''Nano POG''', '''Octave Multiplexer''', and '''Pitch Fork'''.

The POG line of pedals has been used extensively by several prominent 2000s-era rock guitarists, including [[Jack White]] (of [[The White Stripes]], [[The Raconteurs]], etc.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.guitarplayer.com/miscellaneous/1139/jack-white-mega-sonic-on-the-sounds-that-drive-the-white-stripes-raconteurs-and-dead-weather/12785 |title= Jack White Mega Sonic On The Sounds That Drive The White Stripes Raconteurs and Dead Weather |last1= Leslie |first1= Jimmy |date= September 9, 2010 |website= Guitar Player |publisher= New Bay Media, LLC |access-date= September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Josh Homme]] (of [[Queens of the Stone Age]], [[Them Crooked Vultures]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tonereport.com/blogs/tone-tips/tones-for-the-deaf-nailing-josh-hommes-sound |title= Tones for the Deaf: Nailing Josh Homme's Sound |last1= Wolfert |first1= Jamie |date= June 11, 2015 |website= Tone Report |publisher= Stompbox Music, LLC |access-date= September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Envelope, EQ and compression ===
Electro-Harmonix offers several pedals for envelope/equalization modulation. Amongst them are the '''Bassballs''' (appropriately named for its intended use with bass guitars), '''Doctor Q''' and the '''Q-Tron'''. Another pedal of note was the [[vacuum tube]]-powered '''Black Finger''' Compressor which adds distortion-free sustain to the sound and which appeared in the mid 1970s. The [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] '''White Finger''' followed.

In 1995, Electro-Harmonix owner Mike Matthews commissioned Mike Beigel, former owner of Musitronics Corp. and inventor of the [[Mu-tron]] III envelope filter, to design a new envelope filter using the same analog circuitry as the original Mu-tron III, thus keeping the sound as close to the original as possible while adding new features to bring the effect into the new millennium. The pedal featured the same controls as the Mu-tron III and incorporated a "Boost" feature, which activates an internal pre-amp and changes the function of the gain knob giving the '''Q-Tron''' a sound almost identical to the Mu-tron III. Another feature added to Q-Tron was an effects loop switch and attack response switch. Units with these features are called the '''Q-Tron+'''. A smaller more compact version, the '''Mini Q-Tron''', is also available, as well as an even smaller version, the Micro Q-Tron. Electro-Harmonix also currently produces a modulated envelope filter, the '''Blurst'''

=== Other pedals ===
Additionally, Electro-Harmonix produces several other pedals.

These include the '''Graphic Fuzz''' (a fuzzbox which includes an EQ section), the '''Frequency Analyzer''' (which creates [[ring modulation]]) and the '''Voice Box''', a [[vocoder]]. The Voice Box has been included in a series of demonstration videos produced by [[Jack Conte]].&lt;ref name="ehx"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Electro-Harmonix has also made a few small power amp pedals for use as a simple [[guitar amplifier]]. The '''EHX 22 Caliber''' was a 22 watt solid state pedal capable of driving either an 8 ohm or 16 ohm speaker cabinet. It has been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehx.com/products/22-caliber |title=22 Caliber - Power Amp - DISCONTINUED &amp;#124; Electro-Harmonix |publisher=EHX.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 22 Caliber was replaced in the lineup by the '''EHX 44 Magnum''', a similar pedal capable of driving the same speaker load, but at a 44 watt output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehx.com/products/44-magnum |title=44 Magnum - Power Amp &amp;#124; Electro-Harmonix |publisher=EHX.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several pedals produced in the decades prior have also been discontinued, many of which are still in high demand for their unique sound.

=== Acoustic guitars ===

These guitars were only available from EH for a very short time in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;https://electroharmonix.vintageusaguitars.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=23:the-eh-acoustic-guitars-pt-1-the-e-h-guitar&amp;catid=13:electro-harmonix-articles&amp;Itemid=45&lt;/ref&gt; They were available through a special offer for $87.50 with the purchase of $50 or more in certain scratch-n-dent EH products. The list price was $187.50. They didn't buy out a warehouse and put their name on them. These are the model names and descriptions: EH-7010 EH acoustic guitar (mahogany back and sides), EH-7020 EH acoustic guitar (D-28 copy, rosewood back and sides), and EH-7030 EH acoustic guitar (D-41 copy, rosewood back and sides, pearloid binding and inlay, 3 piece back).
They bought them from Moridaira/ Morris Guitar who at the time were the best guitar maker in Japan, making guitars for Fender and many big companies. 
They put the EH on the guitars. The guitar, marked with the brand "Brody" is another Japanese-made acoustic that EH had made for them in the 70's.&lt;ref&gt;https://electroharmonix.vintageusaguitars.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47:the-eh-acoustic-guitars-pt-2-the-brody-guitar&amp;catid=13:electro-harmonix-articles&amp;Itemid=45&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Matthews has stated that Brody was his mother's maiden name.  Unlike the other EH guitar, this one is of a lesser quality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4585">Three [[primary energy]] sources make up the [[energy mix]] in Guinea: [[fossil fuel|fossil]] [[biomass]], [[oil]] and [[hydropower]]. Biomass (firewood and [[charcoal]]) makes the largest contribution in primary energy consumption.&lt;ref name=reegle/&gt; It is locally produced, while Guinea imports all the [[petroleum]] products it needs.&lt;ref name=reegle/&gt; The potential for hydroelectric power generation is high, but largely untapped. Electricity is not available to a high percentage of Guineans, especially in rural areas, and service is intermittent, even in the capital city of [[Conakry]].

{{TOC right}}

== Biomass ==
In 1995, firewood was by far the greatest source of energy, accounting for 85%.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Toole |first1=Thomas |last2=Baker |first2=Janice E. |title=Historical Dictionary of Guinea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIiHwg3Y5u4C&amp;pg=PA81 |date=16 March 2005 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810865457 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, biomass accounted for 89%.&lt;ref name=reegle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reegle.info/policy-and-regulatory-overviews/GN |title=Guinea (2012) |publisher=[[reegle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a 2012 [[International Monetary Fund]] paper, over 74% of households use firewood for cooking.&lt;ref name="IMF"&gt;{{cite book |title=Guinea: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ua84AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27  |date=3 July 2013 |publisher=International Monetary Fund, African Dept. |isbn=9781484318812 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 23% use charcoal.&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt;

== Electricity ==
''Electricité Nationale de Guinée'' (National Electricity Company of Guinea) is responsible for all production and distribution of electricity in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecreee.org/stakeholder/electricite-de-guinee-edg |title=Electricité de Guinée (EDG) |publisher=[[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, service is poor; even households in Conakry are served less than 12 hours a day.&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt; According to ''[[The World Factbook]]'', as of 2013, only 53% of urban areas and 11% of rural areas had access to electricity, leaving 8.7 million people without it.&lt;ref name=Worldbook/&gt; There is also a sharp east-west divide: west of the [[Ouré-Kaba]]-[[Tougué]] axis, nearly 30% had electricity, but that figure dropped to barely over 5% to the east.&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt;

In 2013, electricity production was an estimated 971 million kWh.&lt;ref name=Worldbook&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gv.html |title=Africa:: Guinea |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, an estimated 67.8% of the electricity was obtained from fossil fuel and the remainder from hydroelectric plants.&lt;ref name=Worldbook/&gt; The country has considerable hydropower potential - about 6000 MW or 19,300 GWh annually - but taps only a small percentage of it.&lt;ref name=reegle/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt;

The country is currently engaged in interconnection projects such as the sub-regional ''[[Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve Sénégal]]'' (Sénégal River Basin Development Organization),&lt;ref name=IMF79&gt;''Guinea: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper'', p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; ''Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve Gambie'' (Gambia River Basin Development Organization)&lt;ref name=IMF79/&gt; and [[West African Power Pool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecowapp.org/?page_id=372 |title=(CLSG) – Cote D’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone &amp; Guinea Interconnection project |publisher=West African Power Pool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oil ==
The country has no known reserves.&lt;ref name=Worldbook/&gt; It imported an estimated 9,089 bbl/day in 2012.&lt;ref name=Worldbook/&gt;

== Consumption ==
The estimated 2012 national consumption was 903 million kWh.&lt;ref name=Worldbook/&gt; Consumption per individual was less than the equivalent of half a ton of petroleum, broken down into 80% from biomass, 18% from hydrocarbons and 2% from electricity.&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt;
&lt;!-- Can't source any of this.
The [[mining]] industry is the most energy consuming sector in Guinea, as it consumes a majority of the hydrocarbon imports. The domestic sector is the second largest energy consumer, with a share of 31% of national consumption. Other sectors, like transportation and agriculture, account for about 22% of primary energy available. !--&gt;

The '''Federal Energy Regulatory Commission''' ('''FERC''') is the [[United States]] [[Independent agencies of the United States government|federal agency]] that regulates the transmission and wholesale sale of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce and regulates the transportation of oil by pipeline in interstate commerce. FERC also reviews proposals to build interstate natural gas pipelines, natural gas storage projects, and [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) terminals, in addition to licensing non-federal hydropower projects.

FERC is composed of five commissioners who are nominated by the U.S. President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. There may be no more than three commissioners of one political party serving on the commission at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cama|first1=Timothy|title=Trump taps Dem Senate aide for energy commission|url=http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/340028-trump-taps-dem-senate-aide-for-energy-commission|accessdate=3 November 2017|publisher=The Hill|date=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Federal Power Commission===
The [[Federal Power Commission]] (FPC), which preceded FERC, was established by Congress in 1920 to allow cabinet members to coordinate federal hydropower development.

In 1935, the FPC was transformed into an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent regulatory agency]] with five members nominated by the [[President of the United States|President]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The FPC was authorized to regulate both hydropower and interstate electricity.

=== Natural Gas Act of 1938===
In 1938, the [[Natural Gas Act]] gave FPC jurisdiction over interstate natural gas pipelines and wholesale sales. In 1942, this jurisdiction was expanded to cover the licensing of more natural gas facilities. In 1954, the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin]]'' extended FPC jurisdiction over all wellhead sales of natural gas in interstate commerce.

=== Birth of DOE; FPC Becomes FERC ===
In response to the [[1973 oil crisis]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Department of Energy Organization Act in 1977, to consolidate various energy-related agencies into a [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. Congress insisted that a separate independent regulatory body be retained, and the FPC was renamed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), preserving its independent status within the Department.&lt;ref&gt;42 U.S.C. § 7134&lt;/ref&gt; FERC was also given added responsibility to hear appeals of DOE oil price control determinations and to conduct all "on the record" hearings for DOE.&lt;ref&gt;42 U.S.C. § 7172(d).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, DOE does not have any [[administrative law judge]]s. As a further protection, when the Department of Energy proposes a rule, it must refer the proposal to FERC, and FERC can take over the proceeding if FERC determines that the rulemaking "may significantly affect" matters in its jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;42 U.S.C. § 7174.&lt;/ref&gt; The DOE Act also transferred the regulation of interstate oil pipelines from the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] to FERC.&lt;ref&gt;42 U.S.C. §7172(b) (since repealed)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the FERC lost some jurisdiction over the imports and exports of gas and electricity.

In 1978, FERC was given additional responsibilities for harmonizing the regulation of wellhead gas sales in both the intrastate and interstate markets. FERC also administered a program to foster new [[cogeneration]] and small power production under the [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act|Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978]], which was passed as part of the [[National Energy Act|National Energy Act of 1978]]. The National Energy Act included the Natural Gas Policy Act, which reduced the scope of federal price regulation, to bring greater competition to both the natural gas and electric industry.

In 1989, Congress ended federal regulation of wellhead natural gas prices, with the passage of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-103/pdf/STATUTE-103-Pg157.pdf |title=Statute |website=www.gpo.gov |format=PDF}} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Order 888 ===
In 1996, FERC issued Order 888, which spurred the creation of [[regional transmission organization]]s in the United States. This would impact existing electric power pools by rebranding themselves as independent transmission operators. Electric utilities in some regions began to spin off their generation units as separate companies that would compete in a wholesale electric market administered by the RTOs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/order888.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy Policy Act of 2005 ===

The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] expanded FERC's authority to protect the reliability and cybersecurity of the bulk power system through the establishment and enforcement of mandatory standards, as well as greatly expanding FERC authority to impose civil [[sanctions (law)|penalties]] on entities that manipulate the electricity and natural gas markets. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC additional responsibilities as outlined in FERC's top priorities and updated strategic plan.

===Order 1000===
In 2010, FERC issued Order 1000, which required RTOs to create regional transmission plans and identify transmission needs based on public policy. Cost allocation reforms were included, possibly to reduce barriers faced by nonincumbent transmission developers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/trans-plan.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

== FERC's primary duties ==

The responsibilities of FERC include the following:

* Regulating the transmission and sale of natural gas for resale in [[interstate commerce]];
* Regulating the transmission of oil by pipelines in interstate commerce;
* Regulating the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce;
* Licensing and inspecting private, municipal, and state hydroelectric projects;
* Approving the siting of and abandonment of interstate natural gas facilities, including pipelines, storage and [[liquefied natural gas]];
* Ensuring the reliability of high voltage interstate transmission system;
* Monitoring and investigating energy markets;
* Using civil penalties and other means against energy organizations and individuals who violate FERC rules in the energy markets;
* Overseeing environmental matters related to natural gas and hydroelectricity projects and major electricity policy initiatives; and
* Administering accounting and financial reporting regulations and regulating businesses of regulated companies.

== Jurisdiction and authorities ==
FERC is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent regulatory agency]] within the [[United States Department of Energy]]. The [[President of the United States|President]] and [[United States Congress|Congress]] do not generally review FERC decisions, but the decisions are reviewable by the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. FERC is self-funding, in that Congress sets its budget through annual and supplemental appropriations and FERC is authorized to raise revenue to reimburse the United States Treasury for its appropriations, through annual charges to the natural gas, oil, and electric industries it regulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferc.gov/for-citizens/about-ferc.asp|title=About FERC|accessdate=9 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FERC is independent of the Department of Energy because FERC activities "shall not be subject to further view by the Secretary [of Energy] or any officer or employee of the Department".&lt;ref&gt;42 U.S.C. § 7172(g)&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Energy can, however, participate in FERC proceedings as a third party.

FERC is composed of up to five commissioners who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The President appoints one of the commissioners to be the chairman of FERC, the administrative head of the agency. FERC is a bipartisan body; no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party.

FERC has promoted voluntary formation of [[regional transmission organization|Regional Transmission Organization]]s (RTOs) and [[Independent System Operator]]s (ISOs) to eliminate the potential for undue discrimination in access to the [[electric grid]]; regional and interregional transmission planning and cost allocation through the landmark Order No. 1000.

FERC investigated the alleged manipulation of [[electricity market]] by [[Enron Corporation|Enron]] and other energy companies, and their role in the [[California electricity crisis]]. FERC has collected more than $6.3 billion from California electric market participants through settlements. Since passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has imposed, through settlements and orders, more than $1 billion in civil penalties and disgorgement of unjust profits to address violations of its anti-market manipulation and other rules.

FERC regulates approximately 1,600 hydroelectric projects in the U.S. It is largely responsible for permitting construction of a large network of interstate natural gas pipelines. FERC also works closely with the [[United States Coast Guard]] to review the safety, security, and environmental impacts of proposed LNG terminals and associated shipping.

== Commissioners ==
The Commissioners are:
* [[Cheryl LaFleur]] (term expires June 30, 2019)
* ''Vacancy'' (term expires June 30, 2020)
* [[Neil Chatterjee]] (term expires June 30, 2021)
* [[Richard Glick]] (term expires June 30, 2022)
* [[Kevin J. McIntyre]] (term expires June 30, 2023)

== Criticism ==
FERC has been subject to criticism and increasing acts of activism by people from communities affected by Commission decisions approving pipeline and related projects.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;FERC faces heightened scrutiny as gas projects proliferate, Hannah Northey, E&amp;E, November 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  They contend that FERC "blithely greenlights too many pipelines, export terminals and other gas infrastructure"&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and that FERC's structure in which it recovers its annual operating costs directly from the entities it regulates creates bias in favor of the issuance of pipeline certificates.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Delaware Riverkeepers Network v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, No. 16-CU-416 (D. D.C. March 22, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these critics have disrupted several regular open meetings of the Commission,&lt;ref&gt;e.g., see, RTO Insider, Protesters Interrupt FERC Open Meeting, Michael Brooks, 1/26/2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and they staged two, week-long blockades of the Commission's headquarters in Washington, D.C., to make their points.&lt;ref&gt;Meet the People Making Life a Little More Difficult for FERC this Week, RTO Insider-May 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Pipelines are facing unprecedented opposition," Commissioner LaFleur remarked to the National Press Club in a 2015 speech.  "We have a situation here."&lt;ref&gt;FERC Commissioner Cheryl LaFleur, National Press Club. [https://www.press.org/events/npc-luncheon-cheryl-lafleur-chairman-federal-energy-regulatory-commission Video] [https://www.press.org/sites/default/files/20150127_lafleur.pdf Transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zullo|first1=Robert|title=New FERC chief:Pipeline permit policies to be reviewed|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=December 22, 2017|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=A5|quote=FERC faces several lawsuits over its approval of pipeline projects, which critics say amounts to a rubber stamp that, in turn confers handsome rates of return and powers of eminent domain to seize private property without adequately vetting whether they serve true public purpose.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FERC's decisions in these cases are often upheld by the courts. In a July 1, 2014, decision, ''No Gas Pipeline v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission'', the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) said that pipeline applicants are not likely to pursue many certificates that are hopeless. "The fact that they generally succeed in choosing to expend their resources on applications that serve their own financial interests does not mean that an agency which recognizes merit in such applications is biased," the court said.&lt;ref&gt;NO GAS PIPELINE, Petitioner v. FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION, Respondent Statoil Natural Gas, LLC, et al., Intervenors (Nos. 12–1470, 12–1474, 12–1475). Decided: July 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have directly disputed FERC's critics by pointing out that "FERC is a creature of law. It follows a careful administrative path to regulate only a portion of natural gas such as interstate pipelines and LNG import and export terminals. That regulation includes extensive environmental review, driven by many federal laws enacted by Congress, signed by the president, and reviewed and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. If the agency were to adopt the path [suggested by these critics], FERC's decisions would routinely be overturned by the federal courts."&lt;ref&gt;FERC Protests Make No Sense, Kennedy Maize, Powermag.com, May 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States District Court for the District of Columbia also dismissed a case involving allegations of structural bias on the part of FERC. The plaintiffs contended that the Omnibus Budget Act of 1986 funding mechanism requires the Commission to recover its budget through proportional charges on regulated entities, therefore making FERC biased in favor of the industry from which it gets its funding. But in an order issued March 22, 2017, the court said the plain language of the statute indicates that FERC does not have control over its own budget. "The Commission's budget cannot be increased by approving pipelines; rather, [the statute] requires the Commission to make adjustments to 'eliminate any overrecovery or underrecovery.' If Plaintiffs are unhappy with Congress's chosen appropriations to the Commission…, Plaintiffs' recourse lies with their legislative representatives."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  

In New Jersey, the FERC approval of the [[PennEast Pipeline]] was met with widespread criticism by environmental groups who called the decision highly partisan.  "FERC has once again demonstrated its tremendous bias for, and partnership with, the pipeline industry," said Maya van Rossum, leader of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network.  Doug O'Malley, president of Environment New Jersey, called the FERC approval of the pipeline a "disaster."  [[David Pringle (activist)|David Pringle]], state campaign director of [[Clean Water Action]] and 2018 Congressional candidate, suggested the FERC was serving a partisan interest over the interests of the people of New Jersey, suggesting "The FERC needs to remember it works for the people of the United States not PennEast."
&lt;ref&gt;"Activists critical of federal hearing on PennEast pipeline," App (USA TODAY), 8/17/16: https://www.app.com/story/news/local/land-environment/2016/08/17/activists-critical-federal-hearing-penneast-pipeline/88930848/&lt;/ref&gt;
These criticisms were unfounded as the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on July 10, 2018, rejected the Delaware Riverkeeper Network and Maya Van Rossum’s claim that FERC has an incentive to award pipeline certificates because it collects its operating expenses from regulated parties.  Upholding a lower court ruling, the D.C. Circuit also rejected the Delaware Riverkeeper Network’s challenge to FERC’s use of tolling orders to meet its statutory deadlines for acting on rehearing applications. &lt;ref&gt;Delaware Riverkeeper Network and Maya Van Rossum v. FERC, No. 17-5084 (D.C. Cir. 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the D.C. Circuit has provided additional guidance concerning Commission procedures, stating that in one case FERC failed to consider the cumulative environmental impact of four projects that had been separately proposed by the same pipeline. The D.C. Circuit held that the projects were not financially independent and were "a single pipeline" that was "linear and physically interdependent," so the cumulative environmental impacts should have been considered concurrently.&lt;ref&gt;See, Delaware Riverkeeper Network v. FERC, 13-1015, U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, in a separate decision, the D.C. Circuit sustained the Commission's conduct of separate environmental assessments when it clarified that the "critical" factor was that all of the pipeline's projects were either under construction or pending before FERC for environmental review at the same time, noting that the projects lacked temporal overlap.&lt;ref&gt;Minisink Residents for Environmental Preservation and Safety et al v. FERC (No. 12-1481)&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in another case, the D.C. Circuit sustained the Commission's use of a separate environmental assessment when it reasoned that the projects in dispute were "unrelated" and did not depend on one another for their justification.&lt;ref&gt;Myersville Citizens for a Rural Cmty., Inc., v. FERC, 783 F.3d 1301, 1326-7 (D.C. Cir. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; This guidance has allowed FERC to address additional claims of improper segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC, 149 FERC ¶ 61,258 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  

FERC's leaders have stressed many times since the onset of the increased activism that the proper way to oppose a proposed new infrastructure project is by participating in the related proceeding by submitting comments and participating in public comment sessions, site visits and scoping meetings, since FERC decisions can be appealed up to the Supreme Court.

=== Federal versus state authority ===
There are regions of the country where the state public utility commission and the FERC regulated Regional Transmission Organization operate in identical footprints (e.g., [[New York energy law|New York]]). Where this occurs, state policy makers and FERC frequently clash as to the extent of federal power and influence within the state. 

The planning and siting of public policy and renewable power plants and merchant transmission lines can be contentious because the planning process must proceed through both entities. For example in New York, any large (&gt;20 MW for the NYISO and &gt;25 MW for the state Siting Committee) generation or merchant transmission facility must proceed through both the planning process of the NYISO - which operates on a two-year cycle at minimum with an inclusive class year pool of new projects evaluated simultaneously - and the siting process of the state Board on Electric Siting and the Environment. Prior to the formation of the NYISO, the planning process was mostly determined by the state siting board (although the utilities' [[power pool]] might have had their own closed door planning session) and large generation projects were developed by the utilities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;NYISO 30 OATT Attachment X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/1392EC6DD904BBC285257F4E005BE810?OpenDocument|title=Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  This dual planning process provides an opportunity for other market participants to drag out the process legally, not including the other state and/or federal environmental, trade (if an international connection with Canada is requested) and local certification and regulation processes that need to be met. 

This controversy similarly applies to various electric wholesale-market issues within the RTO, i.e., when a state public utility commission asserts that its retail ratepayers (under state regulation) will be impacted by wholesale-market stakeholder decisions and reforms (under federal-level regulation). In contrast, prior to the formation of the NYISO in 1999 in New York, wholesale energy prices were set within a utility's state rate case proceeding. Examples of contentious issues in New York include the NYISO's development of buyer-side mitigation (price floors) in its capacity market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ferc.gov/CalendarFiles/20170203174908-EL16-92-000.pdf|title=ORDER GRANTING COMPLAINT IN PART AND DENYING IN PART|pp=1-2|publisher=FERC|date=February 3, 2017|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, proxy peaking-unit specifications during the demand-curve reset (that helps set capacity market prices)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rtoinsider.com/ferc-nyiso-demand-curve-37195/|author=Rich Heidorn Jr.|publisher=RTO Insider|title=FERC OKs NYISO Demand Curve Reset|date=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/markets_operations/market_data/icap/Reference_Documents/2017-2021_Demand_Curve_Reset/Demand_Curve_Reset_Comments/Comments%20New%20York%20State%20DPS%20and%20NYSERDA.pdf|title=COMMENTS OF THE STATE ENTITIES ON NYISO STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING ICAP DEMAND CURVE PARAMETERS|pp=i,ii,48-52|date=October 3, 2016|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the state's granting of zero-emissions credits to wholesale-market participating nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rtoinsider.com/ferc-zero-emission-credits-zecs-federal-power-act-93613/|title=Analyst: FERC Asserts Role in Handling Nuke Subsidies|author=Rory D.

'''Fluoride''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|l|ʊər|aɪ|d|,_|ˈ|f|l|ɔr|-}})&lt;ref name="wells313"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=J.C.|title=Longman pronunciation dictionary|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Education Limited/Longman|location=Harlow, England|isbn=9781405881180|page=313|edition=3rd}}. According to this source, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|l|uː|ə|r|aɪ|d}} is a possible pronunciation in British English.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]], [[Monatomic ion|monatomic]] [[anion]] with the [[chemical formula]] {{Chem|F|−}} (also written {{Chem|[F]|−}}), whose salts are typically white or colorless. Fluoride salts typically have distinctive bitter tastes, and are odorless. Its salts and minerals are important [[reagent|chemical reagents]] and industrial chemicals, mainly used in the production of [[hydrogen fluoride]] for [[fluorocarbons]]. Fluoride is classified as a weak base since it only partially associates in solution, but concentrated fluoride is corrosive and can attack the skin.

Fluoride is the simplest fluorine anion. In terms of charge and size, the fluoride [[ion]] resembles the [[hydroxide]] ion.  Fluoride ions occur on earth in several minerals, particularly [[fluorite]], but are present only in trace quantities in bodies of water in nature.

== Nomenclature ==
Fluorides include compounds that contain both ionic fluoride and those where fluoride does not dissociate.  The nomenclature does not distinguish these situations. For example, [[sulfur hexafluoride]] and [[carbon tetrafluoride]] are not sources of fluoride ions under ordinary conditions.

The systematic name ''fluoride'', the valid [[IUPAC]] name, is determined according to the additive nomenclature. However, the name ''fluoride'' is also used in compositional IUPAC nomenclature which does not take the nature of bonding involved into account. 
''Fluoride'' is also used non-systematically, to describe compounds which release fluoride upon dissolving. Hydrogen fluoride is itself an example of a non-systematic name of this nature. However, it is also a [[trivial name]], and the [[preferred IUPAC name]] for ''fluorane''.{{citation needed|date = September 2017}}

[[Fluorine]] is estimated to be the 13th most [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|abundant element]] in the earth's crust and is widely dispersed in nature, almost entirely in the form of fluorides. Many minerals are known, but of paramount commercial importance is [[fluorite]] (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is roughly 49% fluoride by mass.&lt;ref name=Aigueperse/&gt; The soft, colorful mineral is found worldwide.

;In water
Fluoride is  naturally present at low concentration in most [[freshwater|fresh]] and [[saltwater]] sources and may also be present in [[rainwater]]. Seawater fluoride levels are usually in the range of 0.86 to 1.4&amp;nbsp;mg/L, and average 1.1&amp;nbsp;mg/L&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wat/wq/BCguidelines/fluoride/fluoridetoo-01.html|title=Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Fluoride|publisher=Government of British Columbia|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (milligrams per [[litre]]). For comparison, [[chloride]] concentration in seawater is about 19&amp;nbsp;g/L. The low concentration of fluoride reflects the insolubility of the [[alkaline earth]] fluorides, e.g., CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Concentrations in fresh water vary more significantly. [[Surface water]] such as rivers or lakes generally contains between 0.01–0.3 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liteplo|first1=Dr R.|last2=Gomes|first2=R.|last3=Howe|first3=P.|last4=Malcolm|first4=Heath|title=FLUORIDES - Environmental Health Criteria 227 : 1st draft|date=2002|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241572272|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc227.htm#1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Groundwater]] (well water) concentrations vary even more, depending on the presence of local fluoride-containing minerals. For example, natural levels of under 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg/L have been detected in parts of Canada but up to 8&amp;nbsp;mg/L in parts of China; in general levels rarely exceed 10&amp;nbsp;mg/litre&lt;ref name=Fawell&gt;{{cite web|author1=Fawell, J.K.|title=Fluoride in Drinking-water   Background   document   for   development   of   WHO Guidelines  for  Drinking-water  Quality|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/fluoride.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=6 May 2016|ref=WHO/SDE/WSH/03.04/96|language=English|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In some locations, such as [[Tanzania]], the drinking water contains dangerously high levels of fluoride, leading to serious [[Fluoride toxicity#Chronic toxicity|health problems]]. 
* Worldwide 50 million people receive water from water supplies that naturally have close to the "optimal level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tiemann|first1=Mary|title=Fluoride in Drinking Water: A Review of Fluoridation and Regulation Issues|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33280.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=6 May 2016|ref=7-5700 www.crs.gov RL33280|page=3|date=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In other locations the level of fluoride is very low, sometimes leading to [[fluoridation]] of public water supplies to bring the level to around 0.7-1.2 ppm.

Fluoride can be present in rain, with its concentration increasing significantly upon exposure to volcanic activity or atmospheric pollution derived from burning fossil fuels or other sorts of industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Frank A.|last2=Hodge|first2=Harold C.|last3=Dinman|first3=B.

;In plants
All vegetation contains some fluoride, which is absorbed from soil and water.&lt;ref name=Fawell /&gt; Some plants concentrate fluoride from their environment more than others. All tea leaves contain fluoride; however, mature leaves contain as much as 10 to 20 times the fluoride levels of young leaves from the same plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wong MH, Fung KF, Carr HP |title=Aluminium and fluoride contents of tea, with emphasis on brick tea and their health implications |journal=Toxicology Letters |volume=137 |issue=1–2 |pages=111–20 |year=2003 |pmid=12505437 |doi=10.1016/S0378-4274(02)00385-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18078704"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malinowska E, Inkielewicz I, Czarnowski W, Szefer P |title=Assessment of fluoride concentration and daily intake by human from tea and herbal infusions |journal=Food Chem.

== Chemical properties ==

=== Basicity ===
Fluoride can act as a [[Base (chemistry)|base]]. It can combine with a [[proton]] ({{H+}}):
{{NumBlk|:|{{big|F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + {{H+}} → HF}}|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
This neutralization reaction forms [[hydrogen fluoride]] (HF), the [[conjugate acid]] of fluoride.

In aqueous solution, fluoride has a [[acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;]] value of 10.8. It is therefore a [[weak base]], and tends to remain as the fluoride ion rather than generating a substantial amount of hydrogen fluoride. That is, the following equilibrium favours the left-hand side in water:
{{NumBlk|:|{{big|F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + {{H2O}}}} {{EqmL}} {{big|HF + HO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}}|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
However, upon prolonged contact with moisture, soluble fluoride salts will decompose to their respective hydroxides or oxides, as the hydrogen fluoride escapes. Fluoride is distinct in this regard among the halides. The identity of the solvent can have a dramatic effect on the equilibrium shifting it to the right-hand side, greatly increasing the rate of decomposition.

=== Structure of fluoride salts===
Salts containing fluoride are numerous and adopt myriad structures.  Typically the fluoride anion is surrounded by four or six cations, as is typical for other halides.  [[Sodium fluoride]] and [[sodium chloride]] adopt the same structure.  For compounds containing more than one fluoride per cation, the structures often deviate from those of the chlorides, as illustrated by the main fluoride mineral [[fluorite]] (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) where the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are surrounded by eight F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; centers.  In CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, each Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is surrounded by six Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; centers.  The difluorides of the transition metals often adopt the [[rutile]] structure whereas the dichlorides have [[cadmium chloride]] structures.

===Inorganic chemistry===
Upon treatment with a standard acid, fluoride salts convert to [[hydrogen fluoride]] and metal [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s. With strong acids, it can be doubly protonated to give {{Chem|H|2|F|+}}. Oxidation of fluoride gives fluorine. Solutions of inorganic fluorides in water contain F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and [[bifluoride]] {{chem|HF|2|-}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiberg|last2=Holleman|first2=A.F.|title=Inorganic chemistry|date=2001|publisher=Academic Press, W. de Gruyter.|location=San Diego, Calif. : Berlin|isbn=0-12-352651-5|edition=1st English ed., [edited] by Nils Wiberg.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few inorganic fluorides are soluble in water without undergoing significant hydrolysis. In terms of its reactivity, fluoride differs significantly from [[chloride]] and other halides, and is more strongly solvated in [[protic solvent]]s due to its smaller radius/charge ratio. Its closest chemical relative is [[hydroxide]], since both have similar geometries.

===Naked fluoride===
When relatively [[solvation|unsolvated]], for example in nonprotic solvents, fluoride anions are called "naked". Naked fluoride is a very strong [[Lewis base]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwesinger |first1=Reinhard |last2=Link |first2=Reinhard |last3=Wenzl |first3=Peter |last4=Kossek |first4=Sebastian |title=Anhydrous Phosphazenium Fluorides as Sources for Extremely Reactive Fluoride Ions in Solution |journal=Chemistry |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=438–45 |year=2005 |pmid=16196062 |doi=10.1002/chem.200500838 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is easily reacted with Lewis acids, forming strong adducts.  Naked fluoride salts have been prepared as [[tetramethylammonium fluoride]], [[tetramethylammonium fluoride|tetramethylphosphonium fluoride]], and [[tetrabutylammonium fluoride]] has been reported.&lt;ref name=dimagno&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Haoran Sun  |author2=Stephen G. DiMagno  |lastauthoramp=yes | title= Anhydrous Tetrabutylammonium Fluoride | journal= [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] | year= 2005  | volume= 127 | pages= 2050–1| doi=10.1021/ja0440497 | pmid= 15713075 | issue= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many so-called naked fluoride sources are in fact bifluoride salts.

=== Biochemistry ===
At physiological pHs, [[hydrogen fluoride]] is usually fully ionised to fluoride. In [[biochemistry]], fluoride and hydrogen fluoride are equivalent. Fluorine, in the form of fluoride, is considered to be a [[micronutrient]] for human health, necessary to prevent dental cavities, and to promote healthy bone growth.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fawell|first1=J. |title=Fluoride in Drinking-water|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/fluoride.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tea plant (''Camellia sinensis'' L.) is a known accumulator of fluorine compounds, released upon forming infusions such as the common beverage. The fluorine compounds decompose into products including fluoride ions. Fluoride is the most bioavailable form of fluorine, and as such, tea is potentially a vehicle for fluoride dosing.&lt;ref name=Chan2013&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=Laura|author2=Mehra, Aradhana |author3=Saikat, Sohel |author4= Lynch, Paul |title=Human exposure assessment of fluoride from tea (''Camellia sinensis'' L.): A UK based issue?|journal=Food Research International|date=May 2013|volume=51|issue=2|pages=564–570|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996913000446|accessdate=9 August 2013|doi=10.1016/j.foodres.2013.01.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately, 50% of absorbed fluoride is excreted renally with a twenty-four-hour period. The remainder can be retained in the oral cavity, and lower digestive tract. Fasting dramatically increases the rate of fluoride absorption to near 100%, from a 60% to 80% when taken with food.&lt;ref name=Chan2013 /&gt; Per a 2013 study, it was found that consumption of one litre of tea a day, can potentially supply the daily recommended intake of 4&amp;nbsp;mg per day. Some lower quality brands can supply up to a 120% of this amount. Fasting can increase this to 150%. The study indicates that tea drinking communities are at an increased risk of [[dental fluorosis|dental]] and [[skeletal fluorosis]], in the case where water fluoridation is in effect.&lt;ref name=Chan2013 /&gt; Fluoride ion in low doses in the mouth reduces tooth decay.&lt;ref&gt;http://oradyne.net/fluoride-free-toothpaste/&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it is used in toothpaste and water fluoridation.  At much higher doses and frequent exposure, fluoride causes health complications and can be toxic.

==Applications==
{{See also|Fluorochemical industry|Biological aspects of fluorine|Fluorine}}
Fluoride salts and hydrofluoric acid are the main fluorides of industrial value.  Compounds with C-F bonds fall into the realm of [[organofluorine chemistry]].  The main uses of fluoride, in terms of volume, are in the production of cryolite, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is used in [[aluminium smelting]].  Formerly, it was mined, but now it is derived from hydrogen fluoride.  Fluorite is used on a large scale to separate slag in steel-making. Mined [[fluorite]] (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a commodity chemical used in steel-making.

Hydrofluoric acid and its anhydrous form, [[hydrogen fluoride]], is also used in the production of [[fluorocarbons]]. Hydrofluoric acid has a variety of specialized applications, including its ability to dissolve glass.&lt;ref name="Aigueperse"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Aigueperse|first1=Jean|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|last2=Mollard|first2=Paul|last3=Devilliers|first3=Didier|last4=Chemla|first4=Marius|last5=Faron|first5=Robert|last6=Romano|first6=René|last7=Cuer|first7=Jean Pierre|title=Fluorine Compounds, Inorganic|year=2000|doi=10.1002/14356007.a11_307|chapter=Fluorine Compounds, Inorganic|isbn=3527306730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary recommendations==
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for some minerals in 1997. Where there was not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated [[Adequate Intake]] (AI) was used instead. AIs are typically matched to actual average consumption, with the assumption that there appears to be a need, and that need is met by what people consume. The current AI for women 19 years and older is 3.0&amp;nbsp;mg/day (includes pregnancy and lactation). The AI for men is 4.0&amp;nbsp;mg/day. The AI for children ages 1–18 increases from 0.7 to 3.0&amp;nbsp;mg/day. The major known risk of [[Fluorine deficiency|fluoride deficiency]] appears to be an increased risk of bacteria-caused tooth cavities. As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of fluoride the UL is 10&amp;nbsp;mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).&lt;ref name="DRItext"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D and Fluoride | chapter = Fluoride | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 1997 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 288–313 | url = https://www.nap.edu/read/5776/chapter/10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women ages 18 and older the AI is set at 2.9&amp;nbsp;mg/day (includes pregnancy and lactation). For men the value is 3.4&amp;nbsp;mg/day. For children ages 1–17 years the AIs increase with age from 0.6 to 3.2&amp;nbsp;mg/day. These AIs are comparable to the U.S. AIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFSA reviewed safety evidence and set an adult UL at 7.0&amp;nbsp;mg/day (lower for children).&lt;ref name="EFSAtext"&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount of a vitamin or mineral in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). Although there is information to set Adequate Intake, fluoride does not have a Daily Value and is not required to be shown on food labels.&lt;ref name="FedReg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels. FR page 33982.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimated daily intake==
Daily intakes of fluoride can vary significantly according to the various sources of exposure. Values ranging from 0.46 to 3.6–5.4&amp;nbsp;mg/day have been reported in several studies (IPCS, 1984).&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt; In areas where water is [[water fluoridation|fluoridated]] this can be expected to be a significant source of fluoride, however fluoride is also naturally present in virtually all foods and beverages at wide range of concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/nutrients/report?nutrient1=313&amp;nutrient2=&amp;nutrient3=&amp;fg=&amp;max=25&amp;subset=0&amp;offset=0&amp;sort=c&amp;totCount=563&amp;measureby=g |title=Nutrient Lists|publisher=Agricultural Research Service United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum safe daily consumption of fluoride is 10&amp;nbsp;mg/day for an adult (U.S.) or 7&amp;nbsp;mg/day (European Union).&lt;ref name="DRItext" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EFSAtext" /&gt;

The upper limit of fluoride intake from all sources (fluoridated water, food, beverages, fluoride dental products and dietary fluoride supplements) is set at 0.10&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day for infants, toddlers, and children through to 8 years old. For older children and adults, who are no longer at risk for dental fluorosis, the upper limit of fluoride is set at 10&amp;nbsp;mg/day regardless of weight.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Dietary Reference Intakes, which is the "highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects" specify 10&amp;nbsp;mg/day for most people, corresponding to 10 L of fluoridated water with no risk.

In the higher doses used to treat [[osteoporosis]], sodium fluoride can cause pain in the legs and incomplete stress fractures when the doses are too high; it also irritates the stomach, sometimes so severely as to cause ulcers.

=== Topical ===
Concentrated fluoride solutions are corrosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nakagawa M, Matsuya S, Shiraishi T, Ohta M |title=Effect of fluoride concentration and pH on corrosion behavior of titanium for dental use |journal=Journal of Dental Research |volume=78 |issue=9 |pages=1568–72 |year=1999 |pmid=10512392 |doi=10.1177/00220345990780091201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gloves made of [[nitrile]] rubber are worn when handling fluoride compounds. The hazards of solutions of fluoride salts depend on the concentration.

'''Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria''' (FRIN) was established as Federal Department of Forestry Research in 1954. The Institute’s Decree 35 of 1973 and order establishing Research Institute of 1977 changed the status of the Department to an institute being supervised by the Federal Ministry of Environment, but the only Research Institute of the Ministry. For the purpose of developing the nation's education, Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria have a subsidiary college name Federal College of Forestry located in Ibadan charged with training and developing forestry and agricultural practice. The Federal College of Forestry, Ibadan (FEDCOFOR) has six specialized research departments (each having various specialized sections), three support departments. The Federal College Of Forestry, Ibadan is a monotechnic offering both National Diploma (ND) and Higher National Diploma (HND).

'''Hoggin''' is a compactable groundcover that is composed of a mixture of [[clay]], [[gravel]], and [[sand]] or granite dust that produces a buff-coloured bound surface. It is more commonly seen in the south of [[England]] and at [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] properties. The material is aesthetically suited to older properties and is lower maintenance than [[gravel]] alone since it does not need regular raking. Once laid, the surface is somewhat permeable to water and therefore does not easily hold puddles or generate rapid [[surface runoff]]. The material is increasingly being used at domestic properties as a low cost and [[environmentally friendly]] alternative to [[concrete]] and [[block paving]] in paths and driveways.

A compacted [[sub-base]] of larger [[crushed stone]] is often laid prior to the top layer of hoggin, especially if the area to be covered is soft ground, or prone to [[puddle|puddling]]. The larger rocks provide a firm base for the hoggin, and improved drainage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2433">[[File:Amidopropyl Hydroxysultaine.svg|thumbnail|Amidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, R= long hydrophobic tail]]
'''Hydroxysultaines''' are chemical compounds used in high-foaming [[shampoo]]s, bath products and shower gels especially in conjunction with ether [[sulfate]]s and [[alkyl sulfate]]s.  They are also used in industrial applications where high, stable foam is required. Chemically, hydroxysultaines are [[zwitterionic]], typically containing covalently linked positive and negative ions.

==Synthesis==
Hydroxysultaine is prepared industrially by the reaction of [[sodium bisulfite]] with [[epichlorohydrin]] to give the sodium salt (sodium 1-chloro-2-hydroxypropane sulfonate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farn|first1=Richard J.|title=Chemistry and technology of surfactants|date=2006|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Oxford|isbn=978-14051-2696-0|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the synthesis of [[Sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate|isethionate]], which is also used as a 'head-group' in surfactants. It is typically combined with the rest of the surfactant molecule via a [[Menshutkin reaction]] with a [[tertiary amine]].

==Properties==
Hydroxysultaines are also compatible with [[cation]]ic [[surfactant]]s and are stable over a wide [[pH]] range in soft or [[hard water]]. In addition to being used as a surfactant, hydroxysultaines are often used as [[antistatic agent]]s.

==Examples==
Examples include:
* ISOTAINE LAPHS – Lauramidopropyl hydroxysultaine; derived from (C12:0)  [[lauric acid]].
* ISOTAINE CAPHS – [[Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]];   [[cocamide]] is from a mixture of coconut fatty acids, 50% derived from (C12:0)  [[lauric acid]].
* ISOTAINE OAPHS  – Oleamidopropyl hydroxysultaine; [[oleamide]] is from a [[monounsaturated]] [[omega-9 fatty acid|omega-9]] [[fatty acid]],  [[lipid number]] of 18:1 [[cis–trans isomerism|cis]]-9, formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CH(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;COOH.
* ISOTAINE TAPHS – Tallowamidopropyl hydroxysultaine; [[tallow]] is a mixture of fatty acids derived from beef or mutton fat, 
* ISOTAINE EAPHS  – Erucamidopropyl hydroxysultaine; [[erucic acid]] is a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid, denoted 22:1ω9.
* ISOTAINE LHS – Lauryl hydroxysultaine; lauryl refers to fatty acid, lipid number C12:0

A '''referendum on [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] [[Oil well|drilling]]''' was held in [[Italy]] on 17 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/english/news/world/2016/02/11/cabinet-sets-drilling-referendum-apr-17_43bb66e5-beba-41e6-b865-36cba72ee985.html Cabinet sets drilling referendum Apr 17] ANSA, 11 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was on the proposed repealing of a law that allows gas and oil drilling concessions extracting [[hydrocarbons|hydrocarbon]] within 12 [[nautical miles]] of the Italian coast to be prolonged until the exhaustion of the useful life of the fields. 

Although 86% voted in favour of repealing the law, the turnout of 31% was below the [[majority]] threshold required to validate the result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2dd20816-04eb-11e6-9b51-0fb5e65703ce.html#axzz46B5UHVdo Boost for Renzi as oil drilling poll fails] Financial Times, 17 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first referendum requested by at least five [[Regional council (Italy)|Regional Councils]] in the history of the Italian Republic: all 66 previous referendum questions since 1974 were called after the collection of signatures.

==Background==
[[Image:Platform Annamaria B.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Gas platform "Annamaria B" in the [[Adriatic Sea]] off the coast of [[Ravenna]] ([[Emilia-Romagna]])]]
The search for [[hydrocarbon]] liquids and/or gases in the Italian sea is possible - with some restrictions for the coastal and environmental protection - only in certain "marine areas" identified by the [[Italian Parliament]] or by the [[Ministry of Economic Development (Italy)|Ministry of Economic Development]]. From 2013, new drilling is prohibited in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], in the [[marine protected area]]s and in the waters within 12 nautical miles from the coast; however, the concessions approved before 2013 may continue until all of the resources are extracted.

Italy authorized a total of 79 offshore platforms: 31 are located over 12 miles from and 48 within 12 miles.

===Off-shore production of hydrocarbons in Italy===
[[File:EDISON21.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Oil platform "Vega" in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] off the coast of [[Pozzallo]], [[Province of Ragusa|Ragusa]] ([[Sicily]])]]
Within 12 miles, 9 concessions are authorized (with 39 platforms) and their permits have expired and they have asked for an extension: if the "yes" vote wins in the referendum, the 9 expired concessions can not be extended. During 2015 those installations extracted about 622 million [[cubic meter]]s of [[natural gas]] (equivalent to 9% of the national production and 1.1% of total consumption in 2014).

Under the 12 mile limit, there are 17 other concessions expiring between 2017 and 2027, which in 2015 extracted 1.21 billion cubic meters of gas (17.6% of national production and 2.1 % of national consumption in 2014) and 500,000 [[Tonne|tons]] of [[petroleum|oil]] (about 9.1% of national production and 0.8% of consumption in 2014). These concessions, in the event of a victory for 'yes' in the referendum, will not be extended after 2027.

==Referendum initiative== 
The referendum was proposed by several [[Regions of Italy|regional governments]] after the national government passed a law allowing drilling concessions to last until oilfields or gasfields are empty.&lt;ref name=R&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-drilling-referendum-idUKKCN0UX2K4 Italy's constitutional court gives green light to referendum on drilling] Reuters, 19 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 January 2016 the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Constitutional Court]] approved the referendum.&lt;ref name=R/&gt; On 12 February the [[Five Star Movement]] asked President [[Sergio Mattarella]] to delay the referendum until June to allow it to be held alongside [[Italian local elections, 2016|local elections]] in order to raise turnout and save money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2016/02/12/m5s-appeals-to-mattarella-on-drilling_61b9440e-2ee3-4d5c-88ec-1e41469d273a.html M5S appeals to Mattarella on drilling] ANSA, 12 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''kilogram''' or '''kilogramme''' (symbol: '''kg''') is the [[SI base unit|base unit]] of [[mass]] in the [[International System of Units]] (SI). Until 20 May 2019, it remains defined by a [[platinum]] alloy cylinder, the ''International Prototype Kilogram'' (informally ''Le Grand K'' or IPK), manufactured in 1889, and carefully stored in [[Saint-Cloud]], a suburb of [[Paris]]. After 20 May, it will be defined in terms of fundamental [[physical constant]]s.    

The kilogram was originally defined as the mass of a [[litre]] (cubic decimetre) of water. That was an inconvenient quantity to precisely replicate, so in 1799 a platinum artefact was fashioned to define the kilogram. That artefact, and the later IPK, have been the standard of the unit of mass for the metric system ever since.

In spite of best efforts to maintain it, the IPK has diverged from its replicas by approximately 50&amp;nbsp;micrograms since their manufacture late in the 19th century.  This led to efforts to develop measurement technology precise enough to allow replacing the kilogram artifact with a definition based directly on physical phenomena, a process which is scheduled to finally take place in 2019. 

The new definition is based on invariant constants of nature, in particular the [[Planck constant]] which will change to being defined rather than measured, thereby fixing the value of the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre, and  eliminating the need for the IPK.&lt;ref name="draft-resolution-A" /&gt;  The new definition was approved by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) on 16 November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' "The Latest: Landmark Change to Kilogram Approved" Nov 16 2018; https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/11/16/world/europe/ap-eu-france-updating-the-kilo-the-latest.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Planck constant relates a light particle’s energy, and [[Mass–energy equivalence|hence mass]], to its frequency. The new definition only became possible when instruments were devised to measure the Planck constant with sufficient accuracy based on the IPK definition of the kilogram.

== Definition ==
The [[gram]], 1/1000 of a kilogram, was provisionally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic [[centimetre]] of water at the melting point of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|Gramme, le poids absolu d'un volume d'eau pure égal au cube de la centième partie du mètre, et à la température de la glace fondante}}; The term {{lang|fr|poids absolu}} was at the time used alongside {{lang|fr|masse}} for the concept of "mass" (which latter term had first been introduced in its strict physical sense in English in 1704).
See e.g. Mathurin Jacques Brisson, ''Dictionnaire raisonné de toutes les parties de la Physique'', Volland, 1787, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1i0mJteVrOoC&amp;pg=PA401 p. 401].&lt;/ref&gt;
The final kilogram, manufactured as a prototype in 1799 and from which the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK) was derived in 1875, had a mass equal to the mass of 1&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water under atmospheric pressure and at the temperature of its maximum density, which is approximately 4&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]].

The kilogram is the only named SI unit with an [[SI prefix]] (''kilo'') as part of its name. Until the [[2019 redefinition of SI base units]], it was also the last SI unit that was still directly defined by an artefact rather than a fundamental physical property that could be independently reproduced in different laboratories. Three other base units ([[Candela|cd]], [[Ampere|A]], [[Mole (unit)|mol]]) and 17 derived units ([[Newton (unit)|N]], [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]], [[Joule|J]], [[Watt|W]], [[Coulomb|C]], [[Volt|V]], [[Farad|F]], [[Ohm|Ω]], [[Siemens (unit)|S]], [[Weber (unit)|Wb]], [[Tesla (unit)|T]], [[Henry (unit)|H]], [[Katal|kat]], [[Gray (unit)|Gy]], [[Sievert|Sv]], [[Lumen (unit)|lm]], [[Lux|lx]]) in the SI system are defined in relation to the kilogram, and thus its stability is important. The definitions of only eight other named SI units do not depend on the kilogram: those of temperature ([[Kelvin (unit)|K]], [[Celsius|°C]]), time and frequency ([[Second|s]], [[Hertz (unit)|Hz]], [[Becquerel|Bq]]), length ([[Metre|m]]), and angle ([[Radian|rad]], [[Steradian|sr]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|pages=112-118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ha and L are not technically SI units--&gt;

The IPK is rarely used or handled. Copies of the IPK kept by [[Metrology|national metrology laboratories]] around the world were compared with the IPK in 1889, 1948, and 1989 to provide [[traceability]] of measurements of mass anywhere in the world back to the IPK.

The International Prototype Kilogram was commissioned by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) under the authority of the [[Metre Convention]] (1875), and in the custody of the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) who hold it on behalf of the CGPM. After the International Prototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproductions, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting, the CGPM agreed in principle that the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the [[Planck constant]], ''h''. The decision was originally deferred until 2014; in 2014 it was deferred again until the next meeting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CGPM-2014/25th-CGPM-Resolutions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  CIPM has proposed&lt;ref name=cipm_106&gt;{{cite conference

==Name and terminology==
The word ''kilogramme'' or ''kilogram'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|kilogramme}},&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; which itself was a learned coinage, prefixing the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] stem of {{lang|grc|χίλιοι}} {{transl|grc|khilioi}} "a thousand" to {{lang|la|gramma}}, a Late Latin term for "a small weight", itself from Greek {{lang|grc|γράμμα}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Greek {{lang|grc|γράμμα}} (as it were {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:γράφω|γράφ]]-[[:wikt:-μα|μα]]}}, Doric {{lang|grc|γράθμα}}) means "something written, a letter", but it came to be used as a unit of weight, apparently equal to {{sfrac|1|24}} of an [[ounce]] ({{sfrac|1|288}} of a {{lang|la|[[Pound (mass)#Roman libra|libra]]}}, which would correspond to about 1.14 grams in modern units), at some time during Late Antiquity. French {{lang|fr|gramme}} was adopted from Latin {{lang|la|gramma}}, itself quite obscure, but found in the {{lang|la|Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris}} (8.25) attributed by [[Remmius Palaemon]] (fl. 1st century), where it is the weight of two {{lang|la|[[obolus|oboli]]}} (Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dgramma2 s.v. "gramma"], 1879).

Mitteis, ''Griechische Urkunden der Papyrussammlung zu Leipzig'', vol. i (1906), 62 ii 27.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The word {{lang|fr|kilogramme}} was written into French law in 1795, in the ''Decree of [[French Republican Calendar|18 Germinal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

which revised the older system of units introduced by the French [[National Convention]] in 1793, where the {{lang|fr|gravet}} had been defined as weight ({{lang|fr|poids}}) of a cubic centimetre of water, equal to 1/1000 of a {{lang|fr|[[Grave (unit)|grave]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|Convention nationale, décret du 1&lt;sup&gt;er&lt;/sup&gt; août 1793, ed.

The ''metre'' ({{lang|fr|mètre}}) on which this definition depends was itself defined as the ten-millionth part of a quarter of Earth's [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]], given in [[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution|traditional units]] as 3 {{lang|fr|[[foot (unit)|pieds]]}}, 11.44 {{lang|fr|lignes}} (a {{lang|fr|ligne}} being the 12th part of a {{lang|fr|pouce}} (inch), or the 144th part of a {{lang|fr|pied}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the decree of 1795, the term {{lang|fr|gramme}} thus replaced {{lang|fr|gravet}}, and {{lang|fr|kilogramme}} replaced {{lang|fr|grave}}.

The French spelling was adopted in Great Britain when the word was used for the first time in English in 1795,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = https://books.google.com/?id=24QCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA557&amp;dq=kilogramme+weights#v=onepage&amp;q=gramme&amp;f=false

During the 19th century, the standard system of metric units was the [[centimetre–gram–second system of units]], treating the [[gram]] as the fundamental unit of mass and the ''kilogram'' simply as a derived unit. 
In 1901, however, following the discoveries by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] to the effect that electric measurements could not be explained in terms of the three fundamental units of length, mass and time, [[Giovanni Giorgi]] proposed a new standard system that would include a fourth fundamental unit to measure quantities in electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

{{See also|Mass versus weight}}
The kilogram is a unit of [[mass]], a property corresponding to the common perception of how "heavy" an object is. Mass is an ''[[inertia]]l'' property; that is, it is related to the tendency of an object at rest to remain at rest, or if in motion to remain in motion at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a [[force]].

While the [[weight]] of an object is dependent on the strength of the local [[gravitational field]], the mass of an object is independent of gravity, as mass is a measure of the quantity of matter. Accordingly, for astronauts in [[Micro-g environment|microgravity]], no effort is required to hold objects off the cabin floor; they are "weightless". However, since objects in microgravity still retain their mass and inertia, an astronaut must exert ten times as much force to accelerate a 10{{nbhyph}}kilogram object at the same rate as a 1{{nbhyph}}kilogram object.

Because at any given point on Earth the weight of an object is proportional to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a [[weighing scale]]. The ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.

On April 7, 1795, the [[gram]] was decreed in France to be "the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to the cube of the hundredth part of the metre, and at the temperature of melting ice".&lt;span style="margin-left:0.1em"&gt;&lt;ref name="decree"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Since trade and commerce typically involve items significantly more massive than one gram, and since a mass standard made of water would be inconvenient and unstable, the regulation of commerce necessitated the manufacture of a ''practical realization'' of the water-based definition of mass. Accordingly, a provisional mass standard was made as a single-piece, metallic artifact one thousand times as massive as the gram—the kilogram.

At the same time, work was commissioned to precisely determine the mass of a cubic decimetre (one [[litre]]) of water.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;
The same decree also defined the litre as follows: "Liter: the measure of volume, both for liquid and solids, for which the displacement would be that of a cube [with sides measuring] one-tenth of a metre." Original text: "{{lang|fr|''Litre'', la mesure de capacité, tant pour les liquides que pour les matières sèches, dont la contenance sera celle du cube de la dixièrne partie du mètre.|italic=unset}}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="decree" /&gt; Although the decreed definition of the kilogram specified water at 0{{nbsp}}°C—its highly stable ''temperature'' point—the French chemist [[Louis Lefèvre-Gineau]] and the Italian naturalist [[Giovanni Fabbroni]] after several years of research chose to redefine the standard in 1799 to water's most stable ''density'' point: the temperature at which water reaches maximum density, which was measured at the time as 4{{nbsp}}°C.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Modern measurements show the temperature at which water reaches maximum density is 3.984{{nbsp}}°C. However, the scientists at the close of the 18th century concluded that the temperature was 4{{nbsp}}°C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

They concluded that one cubic decimetre of water at its maximum density was equal to 99.9265% of the target mass of the provisional kilogram standard made four years earlier.&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The provisional kilogram standard had been fabricated in accordance with a single, inaccurate measurement of the density of water made earlier by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[René Just Haüy]], which showed that one cubic decimetre of distilled water at 0{{nbsp}}°C had a mass of 18,841 grains&lt;!--EDITORS NOTE: DO NOT LINK "grains" to [[Grain (mass)]] because the poids de marc grain is a different unit. --&gt; in France's soon-to-be-obsoleted ''[[French units of measurement|poids de marc]]'' system. The newer, highly accurate measurements by Lefèvre{{nbhyph}}Gineau and Fabbroni concluded that the mass of a cubic decimetre of water at the new temperature of 4{{nbsp}}°C—a condition at which water is denser—was actually ''less massive'', at 18,827.15 grains, than the earlier inaccurate value assumed for 0{{nbsp}}°C water. &lt;!--

--&gt;France's metric system had been championed by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Charles Maurice de Talleyrand{{nbhyph}}Périgord]]. On March 30, 1791, four days after Talleyrand forwarded a specific proposal on how to proceed with the project, the French government ordered a committee known as the Academy to commence work on accurately determining the magnitude of the base units of the new metric system. The Academy divided the task among five commissions. The commission charged with determining the mass of a cubic decimetre of water originally comprised Lavoisier and Haüy but their work was finished by Louis Lefèvre{{nbhyph}}Gineau and Giovanni Fabbroni. &lt;!--

--&gt;Neither Lavoisier nor Haüy can be blamed for participating in an initial—and inaccurate—measurement and for leaving the final work to Lefèvre‑Gineau and Fabbroni to finish in 1799. As a member of the ''[[Ferme générale]]'', Lavoisier was also one of France's 28 tax collectors. He was consequently convicted of treason during the waning days of the [[Reign of Terror]] period of the [[French Revolution]] and beheaded on May 8, 1794. Lavoisier's partner, Haüy, was also thrown into prison and was himself at risk of going to the guillotine but his life was spared after a renowned French naturalist interceded.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

--&gt; That same year, 1799, an all-platinum kilogram prototype was fabricated with the objective that it would equal, as close as was scientifically feasible for the day, the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at 4{{nbsp}}°C. The prototype was presented to the Archives of the Republic in June and on December 10, 1799, the prototype was formally ratified as the ''kilogramme des Archives'' (Kilogram of the Archives) and the kilogram was defined as being equal to its mass. This standard stood for the next 90 years.

The [[Metre Convention]] was signed on May 20, 1875 and further formalized the [[metric system]] (a predecessor to the [[International System of Units|SI]]), quickly leading to the production of the IPK. The IPK is one of three cylinders made in 1879 by [[Johnson Matthey]], which continues to manufacture nearly all of the national prototypes today.&lt;ref&gt;F.J. Smith.

=== Stability of the international prototype kilogram ===

By definition, the error in the measured value of the IPK's mass is exactly zero; the mass of the IPK ''is'' the kilogram. However, any changes in the IPK's mass over time can be deduced by comparing its mass to that of its official copies stored throughout the world, a rarely undertaken process called "periodic verification". The only three verifications occurred in 1889, 1948, and 1989. For instance, the US owns four {{nowrap|90% platinum /}} 10%{{nbsp}}iridium (Pt{{nbhyph}}10Ir) kilogram standards, two of which, K4 and K20, are from the original batch of 40 replicas delivered in 1884.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The other two Pt{{nbhyph}}10Ir standards owned by the US are K79, from a new series of prototypes {{nowrap|(K64–K80)}} that were diamond-turned directly to a finish mass, and K85, which is used for Kibble balance experiments (see ''{{section link||Kibble balance}}'', above).&lt;/ref&gt; The K20 prototype was designated as the primary national standard of mass for the US. Both of these, as well as those from other nations, are periodically returned to the BIPM for verification. Great care is exercised when transporting prototypes. In 1984, the K4 and K20 prototypes were hand-carried in the passenger section of separate commercial airliners.

Note that none of the replicas has a mass precisely equal to that of the IPK&lt;!-- the closest is Hungary's K16 at 1 kg + 12 μg (Girard) --&gt;; their masses are calibrated and documented as offset values. For instance, K20, the US's primary standard, originally had an official mass of {{nowrap|1 kg − 39 μg}} (micrograms) in 1889; that is to say, K20 was 39{{nbsp}}μg less than the IPK. A verification performed in 1948 showed a mass of {{nowrap|1 kg − 19 μg}}. The latest verification performed in 1989 shows a mass precisely identical to its original 1889 value. Quite unlike transient variations such as this, the US's check standard, K4, has persistently declined in mass relative to the IPK—and for an identifiable reason: check standards are used much more often than primary standards and are prone to scratches and other wear. K4 was originally delivered with an official mass of {{nowrap|1 kg − 75 μg}} in 1889, but as of 1989 was officially calibrated at {{nowrap|1 kg − 106 μg}} and ten years later was {{nowrap|1 kg − 116 μg.}} Over a period of 110 years, K4 lost 41{{nbsp}}μg relative to the IPK.&lt;ref name="Recalibration"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Kilogram and Measurements of Mass and Force|author1=Z.J.

Since there is no prototype marked 8, this prototype is referred to as 8(41).&lt;/ref&gt; All mass changes are relative to the IPK.

There is the distinct possibility that ''all'' the prototypes gained mass over 100 years and that K21, K35, K40, and the IPK simply ''gained less'' than the others.]]
Beyond the simple wear that check standards can experience, the mass of even the carefully stored national prototypes can drift relative to the IPK for a variety of reasons, some known and some unknown. Since the IPK and its replicas are stored in air (albeit under two or more nested [[bell jar]]s), they gain mass through [[adsorption]] of atmospheric contamination onto their surfaces. Accordingly, they are cleaned in a process the BIPM developed between 1939 and 1946 known as "the BIPM cleaning method"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The washing and cleaning of kilogram prototypes at the BIPM |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/Monographie1990-1-EN.pdf |first=G. |last=Girard |year=1990 |publisher=BIPM}}&lt;/ref&gt; that comprises firmly rubbing with a [[Chamois leather|chamois]] soaked in equal parts [[Diethyl ether|ether]] and [[ethanol]], followed by [[steam cleaning]] with bi-[[distilled water]], and allowing the prototypes to settle for {{nowrap|7–10}} days before verification. Before the BIPM's published report in 1994 detailing the relative change in mass of the prototypes, different standard bodies used different techniques to clean their prototypes. The NIST's practice before then was to soak and rinse its two prototypes first in [[benzene]], then in ethanol, and to then clean them with a jet of bi-distilled water steam. Cleaning the prototypes removes between 5 and 60{{nbsp}}μg of contamination depending largely on the time elapsed since the last cleaning. Further, a second cleaning can remove up to 10{{nbsp}}μg more. After cleaning—even when they are stored under their bell jars—the IPK and its replicas immediately begin gaining mass again. The BIPM even developed a model of this gain and concluded that it averaged 1.11{{nbsp}}μg per month for the first 3 months after cleaning and then decreased to an average of about 1{{nbsp}}μg per year thereafter. Since check standards like K4 are not cleaned for routine calibrations of other mass standards—a precaution to minimize the potential for wear and handling damage—the BIPM's model of time-dependent mass gain has been used as an "after cleaning" correction factor.

&lt;!--[[File:Denmark's K48 Kilogram.jpg|thumb|left|K48, above, came from the second batch of kilogram replicas to be produced. It was delivered to Denmark in 1949 with an official mass of {{nowrap|1 kg + 81 μg.}} Like all other replicas, it is stored under two nested bell jars virtually all the time. Still, its mass and that of the IPK diverged markedly in only 40 years; the mass of K48 was certified as {{nowrap|1 kg + 112 μg}} during the {{nowrap|1988–1992}} periodic verification.&lt;ref name="Girard" /&gt;]]
--&gt;
Because the first forty official copies are made of the same alloy as the IPK and are stored under similar conditions, periodic verifications using a large number of replicas—especially the national primary standards, which are rarely used—can convincingly demonstrate the stability of the IPK. What has become clear after the third periodic verification performed between 1988 and 1992 is that masses of the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes have been slowly but inexorably diverging from each other. It is also clear that the mass of the IPK lost perhaps 50{{nbsp}}μg over the last century, and possibly significantly more, in comparison to its official copies.&lt;!--

--&gt;The reason for this drift has eluded physicists who have dedicated their careers to the SI unit of mass. No plausible mechanism has been proposed to explain either a steady decrease in the mass of the IPK, or an increase in that of its replicas dispersed throughout the world.&lt;!--

--&gt;{{refn|group=Note|Note that if the 50&amp;nbsp;μg difference between the IPK and its replicas was entirely due to wear, the IPK would have to have lost 150&amp;nbsp;million billion more platinum and iridium atoms over the last century than its replicas. That there would be this much wear, much less a ''difference'' of this magnitude, is thought unlikely; 50&amp;nbsp;μg is roughly the mass of a fingerprint. Specialists at the BIPM in 1946 carefully conducted cleaning experiments and concluded that even ''vigorous'' rubbing with a chamois—if done carefully—did not alter the prototypes' mass. More recent cleaning experiments at the BIPM, which were conducted on one particular prototype (K63), and which benefited from the then-new NBS{{nbhyph}}2 balance, demonstrated 2&amp;nbsp;μg stability. Experiments on prototypes No. 7 and 32 in January 2014 showed less than 0.5&amp;nbsp;μg mass lost from a third complete cleaning and washing cycle.&lt;ref name="Stock"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Many theories have been advanced to explain the divergence in the masses of the prototypes. One theory posits that the relative change in mass between the IPK and its replicas is not one of loss at all and is instead a simple matter that the IPK has ''gained less'' than the replicas. This theory begins with the observation that the IPK is uniquely stored under three nested bell jars whereas its six sister copies stored alongside it in the vault as well as the other replicas dispersed throughout the world are stored under only two. This theory is also founded on two other facts: that platinum has a strong affinity for mercury, and that atmospheric mercury is significantly more abundant in the atmosphere today than at the time the IPK and its replicas were manufactured. The burning of coal is a major contributor to atmospheric mercury and both Denmark and Germany have high coal shares in electrical generation. Conversely, electrical generation in France, where the IPK is stored, is mostly nuclear. This theory is supported by the fact that the mass divergence rate—relative to the IPK—of Denmark's prototype, K48, since it took possession in 1949 is an especially high 78&amp;nbsp;μg per century while that of Germany's prototype has been even greater at {{nowrap|126 μg/century}} ever since it took possession of K55 in 1954. However, still other data for other replicas isn't supportive of this theory. This mercury absorption theory is just one of many advanced by the specialists to account for the relative change in mass. To date, each theory has either proven implausible, or there are insufficient data or technical means to either prove or disprove it.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The SI unit of mass |url=http://charm.physics.ucsb.edu/courses/ph21_05/kilogrampaper.pdf |first=Richard |last=Davis |journal=Metrologia |volume=40 |issue=6 |date=December 2003 |pages=299–305 |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/40/6/001 |accessdate=November 25, 2009 |bibcode=2003Metro..40..299D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis85"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Recalibration of the U.S. National Prototype Kilogram |author=R.

--&gt;Moreover, there are no technical means available to determine whether or not the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes suffers from even greater long-term trends upwards or downwards because their mass "relative to an invariant of nature is unknown at a level below 1000{{nbsp}}μg over a period of 100 or even 50 years".&lt;ref name="Redef" /&gt; Given the lack of data identifying which of the world's kilogram prototypes has been most stable in absolute terms, it is equally valid to state that the first batch of replicas has, as a group, gained an average of about 25{{nbsp}}μg over one hundred years in comparison to the IPK.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The mean change in mass of the first batch of replicas relative to the IPK over one hundred years is +23.5{{nbsp}}μg with a standard deviation of 30{{nbsp}}μg. Per ''The Third Periodic Verification of National Prototypes of the Kilogram {{nowrap|(1988–1992)}}'', G.{{nbsp}}Girard, Metrologia '''31''' (1994) Pg.{{nbsp}}323, Table{{nbsp}}3. Data is for prototypes K1, K5, K6, K7, K8(41), K12, K16, K18, K20, K21, K24, K32, K34, K35, K36, K37, K38, and K40; and excludes K2, K23, and K39, which are treated as outliers. This is a larger data set than is shown in the chart at the top of this section, which corresponds to Figure{{nbsp}}7 of G.{{nbsp}}Girard's paper.&lt;sub&gt;{{nbsp}}&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

What ''is'' known specifically about the IPK is that it exhibits a short-term instability of about 30{{nbsp}}μg over a period of about a month in its after-cleaned mass.&lt;ref&gt;Report to the CGPM, 14th meeting of the Consultative Committee for Units (CCU), April 2001, 2. (ii); ''General Conference on Weights and Measures, 22nd Meeting, October 2003'', which stated "The kilogram is in need of a new definition because the mass of the prototype is known to vary by several parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; over periods of time of the order of a month ..." ([http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/zip/CGPM22.zip 3.2{{nbsp}}MB ZIP file, here]).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--

--&gt;The precise reason for this short-term instability is not understood but is thought to entail surface effects: microscopic differences between the prototypes' polished surfaces, possibly aggravated by [[hydrogen]] absorption due to [[catalysis]] of the [[volatile organic compound]]s that slowly deposit onto the prototypes as well as the [[hydrocarbon]]-based solvents used to clean them.&lt;ref name="conjecture" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC, ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7084099.stm Getting the measure of a kilogram]''&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been possible to rule out many explanations of the observed divergences in the masses of the world's prototypes proposed by scientists and the general public. The BIPM's FAQ explains, for example, that the divergence is dependent on the amount of time elapsed between measurements and not dependent on the number of times the prototype or its copies have been cleaned or possible changes in gravity or environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/mass/faqs2_mass.html |title=FAQs |publisher=BIPM |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports published in 2013 by Peter Cumpson of [[Newcastle University]] based on the [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] of samples that were stored alongside various prototype kilograms suggested that one source of the divergence between the various prototypes could be traced to [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] that had been absorbed by the prototypes being in the proximity of mercury-based instruments. The IPK has been stored within centimetres of a mercury thermometer since at least as far back as the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Stability of reference masses: VI.

Scientists are seeing far greater variability in the prototypes than previously believed. The increasing divergence in the masses of the world's prototypes and the short-term instability in the IPK has prompted research into improved methods to obtain a smooth surface finish using [[diamond turning]] on newly manufactured replicas and was one of the reasons that led to the redefinition of the Kilogram.

===Dependency of the SI on the IPK===
[[File:SI base unit.svg|thumb|right|264px| The magnitude of many of the units comprising the SI system of measurement, including most of those used in the measurement of electricity and light, are highly dependent upon the stability of a {{age|1879|1|1}}-year-old, golf-ball-sized cylinder of metal stored in a vault in France.]]

The stability of the IPK is crucial because the kilogram underpins much of the SI system of measurement as it is currently defined and structured. For instance, the [[newton (unit)|newton]] is defined as the force necessary to accelerate one kilogram at one [[metre per second squared]]. If the mass of the IPK were to change slightly then the newton would also change proportionally. In turn, the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]], the SI unit of [[pressure]], is defined in terms of the newton. This chain of dependency follows to many other SI units of measure. For instance, the [[joule]], the SI unit of [[energy]], is defined as that expended when a force of one newton acts through one [[metre]]. Next to be affected is the SI unit of [[Power (physics)|power]], the [[watt]], which is one joule per second. The [[ampere]] too is defined relative to the newton.

With the magnitude of the primary units of electricity thus determined by the kilogram, so too follow many others, namely the [[coulomb]], [[volt]], [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]], and [[Weber (unit)|weber]]. &lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: The ohm, siemens, farad, and henry would not be affected, since in terms of basic units, they include the ampere squared in the numerator and the kilogram in the denominator, or vice versa, and the changes in these units cancel out exactly. --&gt; Even units used in the measure of light would be affected; the [[candela]]—following the change in the {{nowrap|watt—}}would in turn affect the [[Lumen (unit)|lumen]] and{{nbsp}}[[lux]].

Because the magnitude of many of the units comprising the SI system of measurement is ultimately defined by the mass of a {{age|1879|1|1}}-year-old, golf-ball-sized&lt;!--EDITORS NOTE: The "minimum" regulation-size golf ball is Ø 1.680{{nbsp}}inches. Golf ball manufacturers typically aim for a diameter of 1.684{{nbsp}}±0.004 inches, which is Ø 42.77{{nbsp}}mm. The diameter of the IPK, if it was formed into a sphere, would be Ø 44.58{{nbsp}}mm. --&gt; piece of metal, the quality of the IPK must be diligently protected to preserve the integrity of the SI system. Yet, despite the best stewardship, the average mass of the worldwide ensemble of prototypes and the mass of the IPK have likely diverged another {{days elapsed times factor|1989|7|1|0.0006434|1}}{{nbsp}}μg&lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE: This factor of 0.0006434 equates to 23.5{{nbsp}}μg per century. --&gt; since the third periodic verification {{age|1989|1|1}}{{nbsp}}years ago.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Assuming the past trend continues, whereby the mean change in mass of the first batch of replicas relative to the IPK over one hundred years was +23.5{{nbsp}}σ&lt;span style="margin-left:0.3em"&gt;30{{nbsp}}μg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the world's national metrology laboratories must wait for the fourth periodic verification to confirm whether the historical trends&lt;sub&gt;{{nbsp}}&lt;/sub&gt;persisted.

Fortunately, ''definitions'' of the SI units are quite different from their ''practical realizations''. For instance, the [[metre]] is ''defined'' as the distance light travels in a vacuum during a time interval of {{frac|299,792,458}} of a second. However, the metre's ''practical realization'' typically takes the form of a helium–neon laser, and the metre's length is ''delineated''—not defined—as {{val|1579800.298728}} wavelengths of light from this laser. Now suppose that the official measurement of the second was found to have drifted by a few [[parts per billion]] (it is actually extremely stable with a reproducibility of a few parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There would be no automatic effect on the metre because the second—and thus the metre's length—is abstracted via the laser comprising the metre's practical realization. Scientists performing metre calibrations would simply continue to measure out the same number of laser wavelengths until an agreement was reached to do otherwise. 
The same is true with regard to the real-world dependency on the kilogram: if the mass of the IPK was found to have changed slightly, there would be no automatic effect upon the other units of measure because their practical realizations provide an insulating layer of abstraction. Any discrepancy would eventually have to be reconciled though, because the virtue of the SI system is its precise mathematical and logical harmony amongst its units. If the IPK's value were definitively proven to have changed, one solution would be to simply redefine the kilogram as being equal to the mass of the IPK plus an offset value, similarly to what is currently done with its replicas; e.g., "the kilogram is equal to the mass of the {{nowrap|IPK&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;42 [[parts per billion]]"}} (equivalent to 42{{nbsp}}μg).

The long-term solution to this problem, however, is to liberate the SI system's dependency on the IPK by developing a practical realization of the kilogram that can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. The units of measure in such a practical realization would have their magnitudes precisely defined and expressed in terms of [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s. While major portions of the SI system would still be based on the kilogram, the kilogram would in turn be based on invariant, universal constants of nature. Much work towards that end is ongoing, though no alternative has yet achieved the uncertainty of 20 parts per billion (~20{{nbsp}}μg) required to improve upon the IPK.

===History of redefinition===
Prior to the redefinition the kilogram, and several other SI units based on the kilogram, were defined by a man-made metal  ''artefact'': the ''Kilogram des Archives'' from 1799 to 1889, and the ''International Prototype Kilogram'' from 1889 onward. 

In 1960, the [[metre]], previously similarly having been defined with reference to a single platinum-iridium bar with two marks on it, was redefined in terms of an invariant physical constant (the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by [[krypton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later the [[speed of light]]) so that the standard can be independently reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification.  

At the 94th Meeting of the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) in 2005, it was recommended that the same be done with the kilogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The Kibble balance (discussed below) is one way do this.

As part of this project, a variety of very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years. They too are covered below. Some of these now-abandoned approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, physical constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to physical constants. All approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories. All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.

=== Kibble balance ===
[[File:Watt balance, large view.jpg|thumb|right|310px|The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST's]] Kibble balance is a project of the US government to develop an "electronic kilogram". The vacuum chamber dome, which lowers over the entire apparatus, is visible at top.]]
{{main|Kibble balance}}
The [[Kibble balance]] (known as a "watt balance" before 2016) is essentially a [[Mass versus weight#Types of scales and what they measure|single-pan]] [[weighing scale]] that measures the [[electric power]] necessary to oppose the weight of a kilogram test mass as it is pulled by Earth's gravity. It is a variation of an [[ampere balance]], with an extra calibration step that eliminates the effect of geometry. The [[electric potential]] in the Kibble balance is delineated by a [[Josephson effect|Josephson voltage standard]], which allows voltage to be linked to an invariant constant of nature with extremely high precision and stability. Its circuit [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] is calibrated against a [[quantum Hall effect]] [[Resistor#Resistance standards|resistance standard]].

The Kibble balance requires extremely precise measurement of the local gravitational acceleration ''g'' in the laboratory, using a [[gravimeter]]. For instance when the elevation of the centre of the gravimeter differs from that of the nearby test mass in the Kibble balance, the NIST compensates for Earth's gravity gradient of 309{{nbsp}}[[Gal (unit)|μGal]] per metre, which affects the weight of a one-kilogram test mass by about 316{{nbsp}}μg/m.

In April 2007, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST's]] implementation of the Kibble balance demonstrated a combined relative standard uncertainty (CRSU) of 36{{nbsp}}μg.&lt;ref name="IEEESteiner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steiner|first1=Richard L.|last2=Williams|first2=Edwin R.|last3=Liu|first3=Ruimin|last4=Newell|first4=David B.|title=Uncertainty Improvements of the NIST Electronic Kilogram|journal=IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement|volume=56|issue=2|year=2007|pages=592–596|issn=0018-9456|doi=10.1109/TIM.2007.890590|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4126915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The combined relative standard uncertainty (CRSU) of these measurements, as with all other tolerances and uncertainties in this article unless otherwise noted, are at one standard deviation (1''σ''), which equates to a confidence level of about 68%; that is to say, 68% of the measurements fall within the stated tolerance.&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory's]] Kibble balance demonstrated a CRSU of 70.3{{nbsp}}μg in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"An initial measurement of Planck's constant using the NPL Mark II watt balance", I.A. Robinson ''et al.'', ''Metrologia'' '''44''' (2007), {{nowrap|427–440;}}&lt;br&gt;NPL: ''[http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/mass-and-force/research/npl-kibble-balance NPL Kibble Balance]''&lt;/ref&gt; That Kibble balance was disassembled and shipped in 2009 to Canada's Institute for National Measurement Standards (part of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]]), where research and development with the device could continue.

[[File:Michelson Interferometer Laser Interference Fringes-Red.jpg|thumb|left|239px|The local gravitational acceleration ''g'' is measured with exceptional precision with the help of a laser interferometer. The laser's pattern of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference fringes]]—the dark and light bands above—blooms at an ever-faster rate as a free-falling [[Retroreflector|corner reflector]] drops inside an absolute gravimeter. The pattern's frequency sweep is timed by an atomic clock.]]

Gravity and the nature of the Kibble balance, which oscillates test masses up and down against the local gravitational acceleration ''g'', are exploited so that mechanical power is compared against electrical power, which is the square of voltage divided by electrical resistance. However, ''g'' varies significantly—by nearly 1%—depending on where on the Earth's surface the measurement is made (see ''[[Earth's gravity]]''). There are also slight seasonal variations in ''g'' at a location due to changes in underground water tables, and larger semimonthly and diurnal changes due to tidal distortions in the Earth's shape caused by the Moon and the Sun. Although ''g'' would not be a term in the ''definition'' of the kilogram, it would be crucial in the process of measurement of the kilogram when relating energy to power. Accordingly, ''g'' must be measured with at least as much precision and accuracy as are the other terms, so measurements of ''g'' must also be traceable to fundamental constants of nature. For the most precise work in mass metrology, ''g'' is measured using dropping-mass absolute gravimeters that contain an iodine-stabilized [[helium–neon laser]] [[Interferometry|interferometer]]. The [[Interference (wave propagation)|fringe-signal]], [[Chirp|frequency-sweep]] output from the interferometer is measured with a rubidium [[atomic clock]]. Since this type of dropping-mass gravimeter derives its accuracy and stability from the constancy of the speed of light as well as the innate properties of helium, neon, and rubidium atoms, the 'gravity' term in the delineation of an all-electronic kilogram is also measured in terms of invariants of nature—and with very high precision. For instance, in the basement of the NIST's Gaithersburg facility in 2009, when measuring the gravity acting upon Pt{{nbhyph}}10Ir test masses (which are denser, smaller, and have a slightly lower center of gravity inside the Kibble balance than stainless steel masses), the measured value was typically within 8&amp;nbsp;ppb of {{val|9.80101644|u=m/s2}}.&lt;ref&gt;R. Steiner, ''Watts in the watt balance'', NIST, Oct 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtue of electronic realizations like the Kibble balance is that the definition and dissemination of the kilogram would no longer be dependent upon the stability of kilogram prototypes, which must be very carefully handled and stored. It would free physicists from the need to rely on assumptions about the stability of those prototypes. Instead, hand-tuned, close-approximation mass standards would simply be weighed and documented as being equal to one kilogram plus an offset value. With the Kibble balance, while the kilogram would be ''delineated'' in electrical and gravity terms, all of which are traceable to invariants of nature; it would be ''defined'' in a manner that is directly traceable to three fundamental constants of nature. The Planck constant defines the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre. By fixing the Planck constant, the ''definition'' of the kilogram would in addition depend only on the ''definitions'' of the second and the metre. The definition of the second depends on a single defined physical constant: the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom Δ''ν''(&lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs)&lt;sub&gt;hfs&lt;/sub&gt;. The metre depends on the second and on an additional defined physical constant: the [[speed of light]] ''c''. Once the kilogram is redefined in this manner, physical objects such as the IPK will no longer be part of the definition, but will instead become ''transfer standards''.

Scales like the Kibble balance also permit more flexibility in choosing materials with especially desirable properties for mass standards. For instance, Pt{{nbhyph}}10Ir could continue to be used so that the specific gravity of newly produced mass standards would be the same as existing national primary and check standards (≈21.55{{nbsp}}g/ml). This would reduce the relative uncertainty when making [[Mass versus weight#Buoyancy_effects_of_air_on_measurement|mass comparisons in air]]. Alternatively, entirely different materials and constructions could be explored with the objective of producing mass standards with greater stability. For instance, [[osmium]]-iridium alloys could be investigated if platinum's propensity to absorb hydrogen (due to catalysis of VOCs and hydrocarbon-based cleaning solvents) and atmospheric [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] proved to be sources of instability. Also, vapor-deposited, protective ceramic coatings like [[Titanium nitride|nitrides]] could be investigated for their suitability for chemically isolating these new alloys.

The challenge with Kibble balances is not only in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly ''practical'' realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of Kibble balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's Kibble balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the Kibble balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in a different part of [[NIST#Organization|NIST headquarters]] facility in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]]. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards down the hall to the Kibble balance after calibration altered their values 10{{nbsp}}[[Parts per billion|ppb]] (equivalent to 10{{nbsp}}μg) or more.&lt;ref&gt;R. Steiner, ''No FG-5?'', NIST, Nov 30, 2007. "We rotate between about 4 resistance standards, transferring from the calibration lab to my lab every 2–6 weeks. Resistors do not transfer well, and sometimes shift at each transfer by 10&amp;nbsp;ppb or more."&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of Kibble balances between even biannual calibrations. When the new definition takes effect, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble balances initially operating in the world.

==Alternative approaches to redefining the kilogram==
Several alternative approaches to redefining the kilogram that were fundamentally different from the Kibble balance were explored to varying degrees, with some abandoned. The Avogadro project, in particular, was important for the 2018 redefinition decision because it provided an accurate measurement of the Planck constant that was consistent with and independent of the Kibble balance method.&lt;ref&gt;}}cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/science/kilogram-physics-measurement.html |title=The Kilogram Is Dead.

On the 93.6{{nbsp}}mm diameter sphere, an out-of-roundness of 35{{nbsp}}nm (deviation of ±17.5{{nbsp}}nm from the average) is a fractional roundness {{nowrap|(∆''r''/''r'') {{=}} {{val|3.7|e=-7}}}}.  Scaled to the size of Earth, this is equivalent to a maximum deviation from sea level of only 2.4{{nbsp}}m. The roundness of that ACPO sphere is exceeded only by two of the four [[Fused quartz|fused-quartz]] gyroscope rotors flown on [[Gravity Probe B|Gravity Probe{{nbsp}}B]], which were manufactured in the late 1990s and given their final figure at the [http://hepl.stanford.edu/ W.W. Hansen Experimental Physics Lab] at [[Stanford University]]. Particularly, "Gyro 4" is recorded in the [[Guinness world records|Guinness]] database of world records (their database, not in their book) as ''the'' world's roundest man-made object. According to a published report ([http://aa.stanford.edu/aeroastro/posters2007/Polhode_Motion.pdf 221{{nbsp}}kB PDF, here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227031301/http://aa.stanford.edu/aeroastro/posters2007/Polhode_Motion.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;!-- Indeterminate link! --&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; and the GP{{nbhyph}}B public affairs coordinator at Stanford University, of the four gyroscopes onboard the probe, Gyro{{nbsp}}4 has a maximum surface undulation from a perfect sphere of 3.4{{nbsp}}±0.4{{nbsp}}nm on the 38.1{{nbsp}}mm diameter sphere, which is a {{nowrap|∆''r''/''r'' {{=}} {{val|1.8|e=-7}}.}} Scaled to the size of Earth, this is equivalent to an deviation the size of North America rising slowly up out of the sea (in molecular-layer terraces 11.9{{nbsp}}cm high), reaching a maximum elevation of 1.14{{nbsp}}±0.13{{nbsp}}m in Nebraska, and then gradually sloping back down to sea level on the other side of the continent.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Another Avogadro constant-based approach, known as the [[International Avogadro Coordination]]'s ''Avogadro project'', would define and delineate the kilogram as a 93.6{{nbsp}}mm diameter sphere of [[silicon]] atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with [[Czochralski process|mature processes]] for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the [[semiconductor]] industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon [[Boule (crystal)|boule]] (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its [[isotope|isotopic]] composition would be measured with a [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical [[interferometry]] to an uncertainty of about 0.3{{nbsp}}nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈{{nbsp}}192{{nbsp}}pm) would be measured using a scanning [[X-ray interferometer]]. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With the size of the sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.

Experiments are being performed on the Avogadro Project's silicon spheres to determine whether their masses are most stable when stored in a vacuum, a partial vacuum, or ambient pressure. However, no technical means currently exist to prove a long-term stability any better than that of the IPK's, because the most sensitive and accurate measurements of mass are made with [[Mass versus weight#Types of scales and what they measure|dual-pan]] [[Beam balance|balances]] like the BIPM's FB{{nbhyph}}2 flexure-strip balance (see ''{{section link||External links}}'', below). Balances can only compare the mass of a silicon sphere to that of a reference mass. Given the latest understanding of the lack of long-term mass stability with the IPK and its replicas, there is no known, perfectly stable mass artefact to compare against. [[Mass versus weight#Types of scales and what they measure|Single-pan]] [[Weighing scale|scale]]s, which measure weight relative to an invariant of nature, are not precise to the necessary long-term uncertainty of 10–20 parts per billion. Another issue to be overcome is that silicon oxidizes and forms a thin layer (equivalent to {{nowrap|5–20}} silicon atoms deep) of [[silicon dioxide]] ([[quartz]]) and [[silicon monoxide]]. This layer slightly increases the mass of the sphere, an effect that must be accounted for when polishing the sphere to its finished size.  Oxidation is not an issue with platinum and iridium, both of which are [[noble metal]]s that are roughly as [[Galvanic series|cathodic]] as oxygen and therefore don't oxidize unless coaxed to do so in the laboratory. The presence of the thin oxide layer on a silicon-sphere mass prototype places additional restrictions on the procedures that might be suitable to clean it to avoid changing the layer's thickness or oxide [[stoichiometry]].

All silicon-based approaches would fix the Avogadro constant but vary in the details of the definition of the kilogram. One approach would use silicon with all three of its natural isotopes present. About 7.78% of silicon comprises the two heavier isotopes: &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Si and &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;Si. As described in ''{{section link||Carbon-12}}'' above, this method would ''define'' the magnitude of the kilogram in terms of a certain number of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C atoms by fixing the Avogadro constant; the silicon sphere would be the ''practical realization''. This approach could accurately delineate the magnitude of the kilogram because the masses of the three silicon [[nuclide]]s relative to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C are known with great precision (relative uncertainties of 1{{nbsp}}[[Parts per billion|ppb]] or better). An alternative method for creating a silicon sphere-based kilogram proposes to use [[Isotope separation|isotopic separation]] techniques to enrich the silicon until it is nearly pure &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si, which has a relative atomic mass of {{val|27.9769265325|(19)}}.&lt;ref name=AvogadroNature&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brumfiel|first=Geoff|title=Elemental shift for kilo|journal=Nature|date=October 21, 2010|volume=467|issue=7318|pages=892|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101019/pdf/467892a.pdf|doi=10.1038/467892a|pmid=20962811}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this approach, the Avogadro constant would not only be fixed, but so too would the atomic mass of &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si. As such, the definition of the kilogram would be decoupled from &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and the kilogram would instead be defined as {{nowrap|{{frac|1000|{{val|27.9769265325}}}} ⋅ {{val|6.02214179|e=23}}}} atoms of &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si (≈ {{val|35.74374043}} fixed moles of &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si atoms). Physicists could elect to define the kilogram in terms of &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si even when kilogram prototypes are made of natural silicon (all three isotopes present). Even with a kilogram definition based on theoretically pure &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si, a silicon-sphere prototype made of only nearly pure &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si would necessarily deviate slightly from the defined number of moles of silicon to compensate for various chemical and isotopic impurities as well as the effect of surface oxides.&lt;ref&gt;NPL: ''[http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/mass-and-force/research/avogadro-project Avogadro Project]''; Australian National Measurement Institute: ''[&lt;!-- http://www.measurement.gov.au/index.cfm?event=object.showContent&amp;objectID=7CBA5E62-BCD6-81AC-15017BE81748EF4B --&gt; Redefining the kilogram through the Avogadro constant]''; and Australian Centre for Precision Optics: ''[http://www.acpo.csiro.au/avogadro.htm The Avogadro Project]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carbon-12 ====
Though not offering a practical realization, this definition would precisely define the magnitude of the kilogram in terms of a certain number of [[carbon-12|carbon{{nbhyph}}12]] atoms. Carbon{{nbhyph}}12 (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C) is an [[isotope]] of carbon. The [[mole (unit)|mole]] is currently defined as "the quantity of entities (elementary particles like atoms or molecules) equal to the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon{{nbhyph}}12". Thus, the current definition of the mole requires that {{frac|1000|12}} moles ({{frac|83|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;mol) of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C has a mass of precisely one kilogram. The number of atoms in a mole, a quantity known as the [[Avogadro constant]], is experimentally determined, and the current best estimate of its value is {{physconst|NA|unit=no|after=&amp;#32;entities per mole.}} This new definition of the kilogram proposed to fix the Avogadro constant at precisely {{val|6.02214|end=X|e=23|u=mol-1}} with the kilogram being defined as "the mass equal to that of {{nowrap|{{frac|1000|12}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;sdot;&amp;nbsp;{{val|6.02214|end=X|e=23}}}} atoms of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C".

The accuracy of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty in the value of the [[Planck constant]]. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50{{nbsp}}parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be no better than the current 50{{nbsp}}ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic ''definition'' of the kilogram (see ''{{section link||Electronic approaches}}'', below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow {{frac|83|1|3}} moles of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.

A variation on a &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C-based definition proposes to define the Avogadro constant as being precisely {{val|84446889}}&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (≈{{nbsp}}{{val|6.02214162|e=23}}) atoms. An imaginary realization of a 12-gram mass prototype would be a cube of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C atoms measuring precisely {{val|84446889}} atoms across on a side. With this proposal, the kilogram would be defined as "the mass equal to {{val|84446889}}&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;{{nbsp}}× {{frac|83|1|3}} atoms of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|last=Hill|first=Theodore P |author2=Miller, Jack |author3=Censullo, Albert C|title=Towards a better definition of the kilogram|journal=Metrologia|date=June 1, 2011|volume=48|issue=3|pages=83–86|doi=10.1088/0026-1394/48/3/002|bibcode = 2011Metro..48...83H |arxiv = 1005.5139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The proposal originally was to redefine the kilogram as the mass of {{val|84446886}}&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; carbon-12 atoms.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia Tech, ''[http://gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/definition-kilogram/ "A Better Definition for the Kilogram?"]'' September 21, 2007 (press release).&lt;/ref&gt; The value {{val|84446886}} had been chosen because it has a special property; its cube (the proposed new value for the Avogadro constant) is divisible by twelve. Thus with that definition of the kilogram, there would have been an integer number of atoms in one gram of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C: {{val|50184508190229061679538}} atoms. The uncertainty in the Avogadro constant has narrowed considerably since this proposal was first submitted to ''[[American Scientist]]'' for publication. The 2014 CODATA value for the Avogadro constant ({{val|6.022140857|(74)|e=23}}) has a relative standard uncertainty of 12 parts per billion and the cube root of this number is {{val|84446885.41|(35)}}, i.e. there are no integers within the range of uncertainty.|group=Note}}

==== Ion accumulation ====
Another Avogadro-based approach, [[ion]] accumulation, since abandoned, would have defined and delineated the kilogram by precisely creating new metal prototypes on demand. It would have done so by accumulating [[gold]] or [[bismuth]] [[ion]]s (atoms stripped of an electron) and counting them by measuring the electric current required to neutralize the ions. Gold (&lt;sup&gt;197&lt;/sup&gt;Au) and bismuth (&lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi) were chosen because they can be safely handled and have the two highest [[atomic mass]]es among the [[mononuclidic elements]] that are stable (gold) or effectively so (bismuth).&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;In 2003, the same year the first gold-deposition experiments were conducted, physicists found that the only naturally occurring isotope of bismuth, &lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi, is actually very slightly [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]], with the longest known radioactive [[half-life]] of any naturally occurring element that decays via [[Alpha particle|alpha radiation]]—a half-life of {{val|19|2|e=18|u=years}}. As this is 1.4&amp;nbsp;billion times the age of the universe, &lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi is considered a stable isotope for most practical applications (those unrelated to such disciplines as [[nucleocosmochronology]] and [[geochronology]]). In other terms, {{val|99.999999983|u=%}} of the bismuth that existed on Earth 4.567&amp;nbsp;billion years ago still exists today. Only two mononuclidic elements are heavier than bismuth and only one approaches its stability: [[thorium]]. Long considered a possible replacement for uranium in nuclear reactors, thorium can cause cancer when inhaled because it is over 1.2{{nbsp}}billion times more radioactive than bismuth. It also has such a strong tendency to oxidize that its powders are [[pyrophoric]]. These characteristics make thorium unsuitable in ion-deposition experiments. See also ''[[Isotopes of bismuth]]'', ''[[Isotopes of gold]]'' and ''[[Isotopes of thorium]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  See also ''[[Table of nuclides (combined)|Table of nuclides]]''.

With a gold-based definition of the kilogram for instance, the relative atomic mass of gold could have been fixed as precisely {{val|196.9665687}}, from the current value of {{val|196.9665687|(6)}}. As with a definition based upon carbon{{nbhyph}}12, the Avogadro constant would also have been fixed. The kilogram would then have been defined as "the mass equal to that of precisely {{nowrap|{{frac|1000|{{val|196.9665687}}}} &amp;sdot; {{val|6.02214179|e=23}}}} atoms of gold" (precisely 3,057,443,620,887,933,963,384,315 atoms of gold or about {{val|5.07700371}} fixed moles).

In 2003, German experiments with gold at a current of only {{val|10|u=μA}} demonstrated a relative uncertainty of 1.5%.&lt;ref name="PTB"&gt;The German national metrology institute, known as the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB): [http://www.ptb.de/en/org/1/12/124/ionenex.htm Working group 1.24, Ion Accumulation]&lt;/ref&gt; Follow-on experiments using bismuth ions and a current of 30{{nbsp}}mA were expected to accumulate a mass of 30{{nbsp}}g in six days and to have a relative uncertainty of better than 1&amp;nbsp;ppm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/zip/CGPM22.zip ''General Conference on Weights and Measures, 22nd Meeting, October 2003''] (3.2{{nbsp}}MB ZIP file).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, ion{{nbhyph}}accumulation approaches proved to be unsuitable. Measurements required months and the data proved too erratic for the technique to be considered a viable future replacement to the IPK.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, Mary, ''[[The Caravan (magazine)|The Caravan]]'', September 1–15, 2009: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110322075220/http://www.marybowers.org.uk/18_The%20Caravan%20September%201-15.pdf "Why the World is Losing Weight"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many technical challenges of the ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously decelerating the ions so they could all deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low energies to avoid [[sputtering]] effects—a phenomenon whereby ions that had already been counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around {{val|1|ul=eV}} (&lt;{{nbsp}}1{{nbsp}}km/s for gold).&lt;ref name="PTB" /&gt;

If the kilogram had been defined as a precise quantity of gold or bismuth atoms deposited with an electric current, not only would the Avogadro constant and the atomic mass of gold or bismuth have to have been precisely fixed, but also the value of the [[elementary charge]] (''e''), likely to {{val|1.60217|end=X|e=-19|ul=C}} (from the currently recommended value of {{physconst|e}}). Doing so would have effectively defined the [[ampere]] as a flow of {{frac|1|{{val|1.60217|end=X|e=-19}}}} electrons per second past a fixed point in an electric circuit. The SI unit of mass would have been fully defined by having precisely fixed the values of the Avogadro constant and elementary charge, and by exploiting the fact that the atomic masses of bismuth and gold atoms are invariant, universal constants of nature.&lt;!-- Should it be mentioned that fixing both the elementary charge and the mass of some atom would "unfix" the magnetic constant of vacuum? --&gt;

Beyond the slowness of making a new mass standard and the poor reproducibility, there were other intrinsic shortcomings to the ion{{nbhyph}}accumulation approach that proved to be formidable obstacles to ion-accumulation-based techniques becoming a practical realization. The apparatus necessarily required that the deposition chamber have an integral balance system to enable the convenient calibration of a reasonable quantity of transfer standards relative to any single internal ion-deposited prototype. Furthermore, the mass prototypes produced by ion deposition techniques would have been nothing like the freestanding platinum-iridium prototypes currently in use; they would have been deposited onto—and become part of—an electrode imbedded into one pan of a special balance integrated into the device. Moreover, the ion-deposited mass wouldn't have had a hard, highly polished surface that can be vigorously cleaned like those of current prototypes. Gold, while dense and a [[noble metal]] (resistant to oxidation and the formation of other compounds), is extremely soft so an internal gold prototype would have to be kept well isolated and scrupulously clean to avoid contamination and the potential of wear from having to remove the contamination. Bismuth, which is an inexpensive metal used in low-temperature solders, slowly oxidizes when exposed to room-temperature air and forms other chemical compounds and so would not have produced stable reference masses unless it was continually maintained in a vacuum or inert atmosphere.

=== Ampere-based force ===
[[File:Meissner effect p1390048.jpg|thumb|right|A magnet floating above a superconductor bathed in liquid nitrogen demonstrates [[Superdiamagnetism|perfect diamagnetic]] levitation via the [[Meissner effect]]. Experiments with an ampere-based definition of the kilogram flipped this arrangement upside-down: an electric field accelerated a superconducting test mass supported by fixed magnets.]]

This approach would define the kilogram as "the mass which would be accelerated at precisely {{val|2|e=-7|u=m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} when subjected to the per-metre force between two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross section, placed one metre apart in vacuum, through which flow a constant current of {{frac|{{gaps|1.602|17X|e=-19}}}} elementary charges per second".

Effectively, this would define the kilogram as a derivative of the [[ampere]] rather than the present relationship, which defines the ampere as a derivative of the kilogram. This redefinition of the kilogram would specify [[elementary charge]] (''e'') as precisely {{gaps|1.602|17X|e=-19}} [[coulomb]] rather than the current recommended value of {{physconst|e|after=.}} It would necessarily follow that the ampere (one coulomb per second) would also become an electric current of this precise quantity of elementary charges per second passing a given point in an electric circuit.
The virtue of a practical realization based upon this definition is that unlike the Kibble balance and other scale-based methods, all of which require the careful characterization of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates the magnitude of the kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to develop a practical realization based upon accelerating masses. Experiments over a period of years in Japan with a [[Superconductivity|superconducting]], 30{{nbsp}}g mass supported by [[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] levitation never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. [[Magnetic hysteresis]] was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=NIST |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522131052/https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/newsfromnist_beyond_the_kilogram.htm|archivedate=May 22, 2008|url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/newsfromnist_beyond_the_kilogram.htm |title=Beyond the kilogram: redefining the International System of Units}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robinson, I.A. |title=Toward a Final Result From the NPL Mark II Watt Balance |journal=IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement |date=April 2009 |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=936–941 |doi=10.1109/TIM.2008.2008090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The microgram is typically abbreviated "mcg" in pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement labelling, to avoid confusion, since the "μ" prefix is not always well recognized outside of technical disciplines.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The practice of using the abbreviation "mcg" rather than the SI symbol "μg" was formally mandated in the US for medical practitioners in 2004 by the [[Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations]] (JCAHO) in their [https://www.aapmr.org/practice/guidelines/Pages/New-Joint-Commission-symbols.aspx "Do Not Use" List: Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Symbols] because "μg" and "mg" when handwritten can be confused with one another, resulting in a thousand-fold overdosing (or underdosing). The mandate was also adopted by the [http://www.ismp.org/ Institute for Safe Medication Practices].&lt;/ref&gt; (The expression "mcg" is also the symbol for an obsolete [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] unit of measure known as the "millicentigram", which is equal to 10{{nbsp}}μg.)

[[File:Leachate Pond.JPG|thumb|300px|A leachate evaporation pond in a landfill site located in [[Cancún]], [[Mexico]]]]

A '''leachate''' is any liquid that, in the course of passing through matter, extracts [[soluble]] or [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] solids, or any other component of the material through which it has passed.

Leachate is a widely used term in the [[environmental science]]s where it has the specific meaning of a liquid that has dissolved or entrained environmentally harmful substances that may then enter the environment. It is most commonly used in the context of land-filling of putrescible or industrial waste.

In the narrow environmental context leachate is therefore any liquid material that drains from land or stockpiled material and contains significantly elevated concentrations of undesirable material derived from the material that it has passed through.

==Landfill leachate==
Leachate from a [[landfill]] varies widely in composition depending on the age of the landfill and the type of [[waste]] that it contains.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, J.; Heinke, G. (1996) Environmental Science and Engineering, Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-120650-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ayoung/landfill.html DoE Report CWM039A+B/92] Young, A. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; It usually contains both dissolved and suspended material. The generation of leachate is caused principally by [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] percolating through waste deposited in a landfill. Once in contact with decomposing solid waste, the percolating water becomes contaminated, and if it then flows out of the waste material it is termed leachate.&lt;ref&gt;Washington State Departmentof Ecology, [http://www.ecy.wa.gov/pubs/87013.pdf Solid Waste Landfill Design Manual]&lt;/ref&gt; Additional leachate volume is produced during this decomposition of [[carbon]]aceous material producing a wide range of other materials including [[methane]], [[carbon dioxide]] and a complex mixture of [[organic acid]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[alcohol]]s and simple sugars.

The risks of leachate generation can be mitigated by properly designed and engineered landfill sites, such as those that are constructed on geologically impermeable materials or sites that use impermeable liners made of [[geomembrane]]s or engineered [[clay]]. The use of linings is now mandatory within the [[United States]], [[Australia]] and the [[European Union]] except where the waste is deemed inert. In addition, most toxic and difficult materials are now specifically excluded from landfilling. However, despite much stricter statutory controls, leachates from modern sites are often found to contain a range of contaminants stemming from illegal activity or legally discarded household and domestic products.

===Composition of landfill leachate===
When water percolates through waste, it promotes and assists the process of decomposition by [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. These processes in turn release by-products of decomposition and rapidly use up any available oxygen, creating an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] environment. In actively decomposing waste, the temperature rises and the [[pH]] falls rapidly with the result that many metal ions that are relatively insoluble at neutral [[pH]] become dissolved in the developing leachate. The decomposition processes themselves release more water, which adds to the volume of leachate. Leachate also reacts with materials that are not prone to decomposition themselves, such as fire ash, [[cement]]-based building materials and gypsum-based materials changing the chemical composition. In sites with large volumes of building waste, especially those containing [[gypsum]] plaster, the reaction of leachate with the gypsum can generate large volumes of [[hydrogen sulfide]], which may be released in the leachate and may also form a large component of the landfill gas.

In a landfill that receives a mixture of municipal, commercial, and mixed [[industrial waste]] but excludes significant amounts of concentrated chemical waste, landfill leachate may be characterized as a water-based solution of four groups of contaminants: dissolved organic matter (alcohols, acids, aldehydes, short chain sugars etc.), inorganic macro components (common cations and anions including sulfate, chloride, iron, aluminium, zinc and ammonia), heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cu, Hg), and [[xenobiotic]] organic compounds such as [[halogen]]ated organics, ([[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s, [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10643380290813462 Present and Long-Term Composition of MSW Landfill Leachate: A Review] "Peter Kjeldsen, Morton A. Barlaz, Alix P. Rooker, Anders Baun, Anna Ledin, and Thomas H. Christensen"&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical appearance of leachate when it emerges from a typical landfill site is a strongly odoured black-, yellow- or orange-coloured cloudy liquid. The smell is acidic and offensive and may be very pervasive because of hydrogen-, nitrogen- and sulfur-rich organic species such as [[mercaptans]].

===Leachate management===
In older landfills and those with no membrane between the waste and the underlying geology, leachate is free to leave the waste and flow directly into the [[groundwater]]. In such cases, high concentrations of leachate are often found in nearby springs and flushes. As leachate first emerges it can be black in colour, anoxic, and possibly [[effervescent]], with dissolved and entrained gases. As it becomes oxygenated it tends to turn brown or yellow because of the presence of iron salts in solution and in suspension. It also quickly develops a bacterial flora often comprising substantial growths of ''[[Sphaerotilus natans]]''.

===History of landfill leachate collection===
In the UK, in the late 1960s, central Government policy was to ensure new landfill sites were being chosen with permeable underlying geological strata to avoid the build-up of leachate. This policy was dubbed "dilute and disperse". However, following a number of cases where this policy was seen to be failing, and an exposee in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' of serious environmental damage being caused by inappropriate disposal of industrial wastes, both policy and the law were changed. '''The Deposit of Poisonous Wastes Act 1972''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/acts/deposit-of-poisonous-waste-act-1972|title=Deposit of Poisonous Waste Act 1972 (Hansard)|author=|date=|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with '''The 1974 Local Government Act''', made local government responsible for waste disposal and for the enforcement of environmental standards regarding waste disposal. 

Proposed landfill locations also had to be justified not only by geography but also scientifically. Many European countries decided to select landfill sites in groundwater-free clay geological conditions or to require that the site have an engineered lining. In the wake of European advancements, the United States increased its development of leachate retaining and collection systems. This quickly led from lining in principle to the use of multiple lining layers in all landfills (excepting those truly inert).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leachate.co.uk/html/an_introduction.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goals of leachate collection systems===
The primary criterion for design of the leachate system is that all leachate be collected and removed from the landfill at a rate sufficient to prevent an unacceptable [[hydraulic head]] occurring at any point over the lining system.

===Components of leachate collection systems===
There are many components to a collection system including pumps, manholes, discharge lines and liquid level monitors. However, there are four main components which govern the overall efficiency of the system. These four elements are liners, filters, pumps and sumps.

====Liners====
Natural and synthetic liners may be utilized as both a collection device and as a means for isolating leachate within the fill to protect the soil and groundwater below. The chief concern is the ability of a liner to maintain integrity and impermeability over the life of the landfill. Subsurface water monitoring, leachate collection, and clay liners are commonly included in the design and construction of a waste landfill. To effectively serve the purpose of containing leachate in a landfill, a liner system must possess a number of physical properties. The liner must have high tensile strength, flexibility, and elongation without failure. It is also important that the liner resist abrasion, puncture, and chemical degradation by leachate. Lastly, the liner must withstand temperature variation and be black (to resist UV light), easily installed, and economical.

There are several types of liners used in leachate control and collection. These types include [[geomembranes]], geosynthetic clay liners, [[geotextiles]], [[geogrids]], [[geonets]], and [[geocomposites]]. Each style of liner has specific uses and abilities. Geomembranes are used to provide a barrier between mobile polluting substances released from wastes and the groundwater. In the closing of landfills, geomembranes are used to provide a low-permeability cover barrier to prevent the intrusion of rain water. Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are fabricated by distributing [[sodium bentonite]] in a uniform thickness between woven and non-woven geotextiles. Sodium bentonite has a low permeability, which makes GCLs a suitable alternative to clay liners in a composite liner system. Geotextiles are used as separation between two different types of soils to prevent contamination of the lower layer by the upper layer. Geotextiles also act as a cushion to protect synthetic layers against puncture from underlying and overlaying rocks. Geogrids are structural synthetic materials used in slope veneer stability to create stability for cover soils over synthetic liners or as soil reinforcement in steep slopes. [[Geonets]] are synthetic drainage materials that are often used in lieu of sand and gravel. Radz can take {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} of drainage sand, thus increasing the landfill space for waste. Geocomposites are a combination of synthetic materials that are ordinarily used singly. A common type of geocomposite is a geonet that is heat-bonded to two layers of geotextile, one on each side. The geocomposite serves as a filter and drainage medium.

Geosynthetic clay liners are a type of combination liner. One advantage to using a geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) is the ability to order exact amounts of the liner. Ordering precise amounts from the manufacturer prevents surplus and over-spending. Another advantage to GCLs is that the liner can be used in areas without an adequate clay source. On the other hand, GCLs are heavy and cumbersome, and their installation is very labor-intensive. In addition to being arduous and difficult under normal conditions, installation can be cancelled during damp conditions because the bentonite would absorb the moisture, making the job even more burdensome and tedious.

====Leachate drainage system====
The leachate drainage system is responsible for the collection and transport of the leachate collected inside the liner. The pipe dimensions, type, and layout must all be planned with the weight and pressure of waste, and transport vehicles in mind. The pipes are located on the floor of the cell. Above the network lies an enormous amount of weight and pressure. To support this, the pipes can either be flexible or rigid, but the joints to connect the pipes yield better results if the connections are flexible. An alternative to placing the collection system underneath the waste is to position the conduits in trenches or above grade.

The collection pipe network of a leachate collection system drains, collects, and transports leachate through the drainage layer to a collection sump where it is removed for treatment or disposal. The pipes also serve as drains within the drainage layer to minimize the mounding of leachate in the layer. These pipes are designed with cuts that are inclined to 120 degrees, preventing entry of solid particles.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, T. H., R. Cossu, and R. Stegmann, eds. Landfilling of waste leachate. London: Elsevier Applied Science, 1992. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

====Filters====
The filter layer is used above the drainage layer in leachate collection. There are two types of filters typically used in engineering practices: granular and geotextile. Granular filters consist of one or more soil layers or multiple layers having a coarser gradation in the direction of the seepage than the soil to be protected.

====Sumps or leachate well====
As liquid enters the landfill cell, it moves down the filter, passes through the pipe network, and rests in the sump. As collection systems are planned, the number, location, and size of the sumps are vital to an efficient operation. When designing sumps, the amount of leachate and liquid expected is the foremost concern. Areas in which rainfall is higher than average typically have larger sumps. A further criterion for sump planning is accounting for the pump capacity. The relationship of pump capacity and sump size is inverse. If the pump capacity is low, the volume of the sump should be larger than average. It is critical for the volume of the sump to be able to store the expected leachate between pumping cycles. This relationship helps maintain a healthy operation. Sump pumps can function with preset phase times. If the flow is not predictable, a predetermined leachate height level can automatically switch the system on. 

Other conditions for sump planning are maintenance and pump [[Drawdown (hydrology)|drawdown]]. Collection pipes typically convey the leachate by gravity to one or more sumps, depending upon the size of the area drained. Leachate collected in the sump is removed by pumping to a vehicle, to a holding facility for subsequent vehicle pickup, or to an on-site treatment facility. Sump dimensions are governed by the amount of leachate to be stored, pump capacity, and minimum pump drawdown. The volume of the sump must be sufficient to hold the maximum amount of leachate anticipated between pump cycles, plus an additional volume equal to the minimum pump drawdown volume. Sump size should also consider dimensional requirements for conducting maintenance and inspection activities. Sump pumps may operate with preset cycling times or, if leachate flow is less predictable, the pump may be automatically switched on when the leachate reaches a predetermined level.

====Membrane and collection for treatment====
More modern landfills in the developed world have some form of membrane separating the waste from the surrounding ground, and in such sites there is often a leachate collection series of pipes laid on the membrane to convey the leachate to a collection or treatment location. An example of a treatment system with only minor membrane use is the [[Nantmel Landfill Site]].

All membranes are porous to a limited extent so that, over time, low volumes of leachate will cross the membrane. The design of landfill membranes is at such low volumes that they should never have a measurable adverse impact on the quality of the receiving groundwater. A more significant risk may be the failure or abandonment of the leachate collection system. Such systems are prone to internal failure as landfills suffer large internal movements as waste decomposes unevenly and thus buckles and distorts pipes. If a leachate collection system fails, leachate levels will slowly build in a site and may even over-top the containing membrane and flow out into the environment. Rising leachate levels can also wet waste masses that have previously been dry, triggering further active decomposition and leachate generation. Thus, what appears to be a stabilised and inactive site can become re-activated and restart significant gas production and exhibit significant changes in finished ground levels.

===Re-injection into landfill===
One method of leachate management that was more common in uncontained sites was leachate re-circulation, in which leachate was collected and re-injected into the waste mass. This process greatly accelerated decomposition and therefore gas production and had the impact of converting some leachate volume into [[landfill gas]] and reducing the overall volume of leachate for disposal. However, it also tended to increase substantially the concentrations of contaminant materials, making it a more difficult waste to treat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leachate Recirculation Practise and Views|url=http://leachate.co.uk/main/leachate-management/leachate-recirculation-practise/|accessdate=2017-08-18|date=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
[[File:Leachate processing tanks.jpg|thumb|Leachate processing / equalization tanks used in leachate treatment before releasing to a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SWANA 2012 Excellence Award Application "Landfill Gas Control" Seneca Landfill, Inc|url=https://swana.org/Portals/0/Awards/2012Noms/Landfill_Gas_Control_silver.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most common method of handling collected leachate is on-site treatment. When treating leachate on-site, the leachate is pumped from the sump into the treatment tanks. The leachate may then be mixed with chemical reagents to modify the pH and to coagulate and settle solids and to reduce the concentration of hazardous matter. Traditional treatment involved a modified form of [[activated sludge]] to substantially reduce the dissolved organic content. Nutrient imbalance can cause difficulties in maintaining an effective biological treatment stage. The treated liquor is rarely of sufficient quality to be released to the environment and may be tankered or piped to a local sewage treatment facility; the decision depends on the age of the landfill and on the limit of water quality that must be achieved after treatment. With high conductivity, leachate is hard to treat with biological treatment or chemical treatment.

Treatment with reverse osmosis is also limited, resulting in low recoveries and fouling of the RO membranes. Reverse osmosis applicability is limited by conductivity, organics, and scaling inorganic elements such as CaSO4, Si, and Ba.

===Removal to sewer system===
In some older landfills, leachate was directed to the [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, but this can cause a number of problems. Toxic metals from leachate passing through the [[sewage treatment]] plant concentrate in the sewage sludge, making it difficult or dangerous to dispose of the sludge without incurring a risk to the environment. In [[Europe]], regulations and controls have improved in recent decades, and toxic wastes are now no longer permitted to be disposed of in the Municipal Solid Waste landfills, and in most developed countries the metals problem has diminished. Paradoxically, however, as sewage treatment plant discharges are being improved throughout Europe and many other countries, the plant operators are finding that leachates are difficult waste streams to treat. This is because leachates contain very high [[ammoniacal nitrogen]] concentrations, are usually very acidic, are often anoxic and, if received in large volumes relative to the incoming sewage flow, lack the [[Phosphorus]] needed to prevent nutrient starvation for the biological communities that perform the sewage treatment processes. The result is that leachates are a difficult-to-treat waste stream. 

However, within ageing [[municipal solid waste]] landfills, this may not be a problem as the pH returns close to neutral after the initial stage of acidogenic leachate decomposition. Many sewer undertakers limit maximum [[ammoniacal nitrogen]]&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Environmental Science and Technology - Third Edition - Andrew Porteous - {{ISBN|0-471-63470-0}}, pg 25.&lt;/ref&gt; concentration in their sewers to 250&amp;nbsp;mg/l to protect sewer maintenance workers, as the [[World Health Organization|WHO's]] maximum occupational safety limit would be exceeded at above [[pH]] 9 to 10, which is often the highest pH allowed in sewer discharges.

Many older leachate streams also contained a variety of synthetic organic species and their decomposition products, some of which had the potential to be acutely damaging to the environment.

===Environmental impact===
The risks from waste leachate are due to its high organic contaminant concentrations and high concentration of [[ammonia]]. [[Pathogen]]ic [[microorganism]]s that might be present in it are often cited as the most important, but pathogenic organism counts reduce rapidly with time in the landfill, so this only applies to the freshest leachate. Toxic substances may, however, be present in variable concentrations, and their presence is related to the nature of the waste deposited.
  
Most landfills containing organic material will produce [[methane]], some of which dissolves in the leachate. This could, in theory, be released in poorly ventilated areas in the treatment plant. All plants in Europe must now be assessed under the EU ATEX Directive and [[zoning|zoned]] where explosion risks are identified to prevent future accidents. The most important requirement is the prevention of the discharge of dissolved methane from untreated leachate into public sewers, and most sewage treatment authorities limit the permissible discharge concentration of dissolved methane to 0.14&amp;nbsp;mg/l, or 1/10 of the lower explosive limit. This entails methane stripping from the leachate.

The greatest environmental risks occur in the discharges from older sites constructed before modern engineering standards became mandatory and also from sites in the developing world where modern standards have not been applied. There are also substantial risks from illegal sites and ad-hoc sites used by organizations outside the law to dispose of waste materials. Leachate streams running directly into the aquatic environment have both an acute and chronic impact on the environment, which may be very severe and can severely diminish bio-diversity and greatly reduce populations of sensitive species. Where toxic metals and organics are present this can lead to chronic toxin accumulation in both local and far distant populations. Rivers impacted by leachate are often yellow in appearance and often support severe overgrowths of [[sewage fungus]].

The contemporary research in the field of assessment techniques and remedial technology of environmental issues originating from landfill leachate has been reviewed in an article published in Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology journal  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10643389.2013.876524, https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Soumyadeep_Mukhopadhyay/publication/275523716_Contemporary_Environmental_Issues_of_Landfill_Leachate_Assessment_and_Remedies/links/5559661608ae6943a876c05a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Problems and failures with collection systems===
Leachate collection systems can experience many problems including clogging with mud or silt. [[Bioclogging]] can be exacerbated by the growth of micro-organisms in the conduit. The conditions in leachate collection systems are ideal for micro-organisms to multiply. Chemical reactions in the leachate may also cause clogging through generation of solid residues. The chemical composition of leachate can weaken pipe walls, which may then fail.

== Other types of leachate ==
{{main|Leaching (chemistry)|l1=Leaching (chemical science)}}

Leachate can also be produced from land that was contaminated by chemicals or toxic materials used in industrial activities such as [[factory|factories]], [[mining|mines]] or storage sites. [[Composting]] sites in areas of high rainfall also produce leachate.{{clarify|date=February 2015}}&lt;!--Or is this "Composting sites also produce leachate during times of high rainfall."?--&gt;

Leachate is also associated with stockpiled [[coal]] and with waste materials from metal ore [[mining]] and other rock extraction processes, especially those in which sulfide containing materials are exposed to air producing [[sulfuric acid]], often with elevated metal concentrations.

In the context of civil engineering (more specifically reinforced concrete design), leachate refers to the effluent of pavement wash-off (that may include melting snow and ice with salt) that permeates through the cement paste onto the surface of the steel reinforcement, thereby catalyzing its oxidation and [[Concrete degradation|degradation]]. Leachates can be [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = A | last2 = Chandra | first2 = S | last3 = Kumar Gupta | first3 = S | last4 = Chauhan | first4 = LK | last5 = Kumar Rath | first5 = S | date = Feb 2007 | title = Mutagenicity of leachates from industrial solid wastes using Salmonella reverse mutation assay | url = | journal = Ecotoxicol Environ Saf. | volume = 66 | issue = 2| pages = 210–6 | doi=10.1016/j.ecoenv.2006.02.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:N-Oxoammonium salt.png|thumb|right|120px|The structure of a typical ''N''-oxoammonium salt.]]
'''''N''-Oxoammonium salts''' in [[organic chemistry]] are a class of [[organic compound]]s sharing a [[functional group]] with the general structure R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=O X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; where X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[counterion]]. They are isoelectronic with [[carbonyl]]s and structurally related to [[aldoxime]]s (hydroxylamines) and [[aminoxyl]] (nitroxide) radicals, with which they can interconvert via a series of [[redox]] steps.

The '''Nuclear Institute for Food and Agriculture''', known as '''NIFA''', is one of four  agriculture and [[food irradiation]] research institute managed by the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]]. The institute is tasked to carry out research in Crop production and protection, soil fertility, water management and conservation and value addition of food resources, employing nuclear and other contemporary techniques.

NIFA was the brainchild of [[Ishrat Hussain Usmani]], bureaucrat and chairman of the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]], however due to economic difficulties, the plans were not carried out until the 1980s. In 1982, [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] led the establishment of the institute and its first director was [[Abdul Rashid (agriculturist)|Abdul Rashid]] who revolutionized the institute.

The NIFA administers cobalt-60 radiation source, [[Laser absorption spectrometry|Laser absorption spectrometer]] and [[Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry]], [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|Near-infrared spectrometer]]  and [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy]].

A library was opened in 1990, and recently, the institute has acquired 75 acres of land at [[Chashma Nuclear Power Plant|CHASNUPP-I]] site.

Much like the concept of a [[horizon|terrestrial horizon]], it represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the universe,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Robert Harrison|title=Cosmology: the science of the universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNxeHD2cbLYC&amp;pg=PA447|accessdate=1 May 2011|year=2000|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-66148-5|pages=447–}}&lt;/ref&gt; so its distance at the present epoch defines the size of the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew R. Liddle|author2=David Hilary Lyth|title=Cosmological inflation and large-scale structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmWauPZSovMC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=13 April 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57598-0|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the expansion of the universe it is not simply the [[age of the universe]] times the [[speed of light]] (approximately 13.8 billion light-years), but rather the speed of light times the [[conformal time]]. The existence, properties, and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on the particular [[physical cosmology|cosmological model]].

==Conformal time and the particle horizon==
In terms of [[comoving distance]], the particle horizon is equal to the '''conformal time''' &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; that has passed since the [[Big Bang]], times the [[speed of light]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. In general, the conformal time at a certain time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \int_{0}^{t} \frac{dt'}{a(t')},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], and we have taken the Big Bang to be at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;. By convention, a subscript 0 indicates "today" so that the conformal time today &lt;math&gt;\eta(t_0) = \eta_0 = 1.48 \times 10^{18}\text{ s}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the conformal time is not the [[age of the universe]]. Rather, the conformal time is the amount of time it would take a photon to travel from where we are located to the furthest observable distance provided the universe ceased expanding. As such, &lt;math&gt;\eta_0&lt;/math&gt; is not a physically meaningful time (this much time has not yet actually passed), though, as we will see, the particle horizon with which it is associated is a conceptually meaningful distance.

The particle horizon recedes constantly as time passes and the conformal time grows. As such, the observed size of the universe always increases.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Paul Hobson|author2=George Efstathiou|author3=Anthony N.

:&lt;math&gt;a(t) H_p(t) = a(t) \int_{0}^{t} \frac{c\,dt'}{a(t')}&lt;/math&gt;

==Evolution of the particle horizon==

In this section we consider the [[FLRW]] cosmological model. In that context, the universe can be approximated as composed by non-interacting constituents, each one being a perfect fluid with density &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt;, partial pressure &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and state equation &lt;math&gt;p_i=\omega_i \rho_i&lt;/math&gt;, such that they add up to the total density  &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and total pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* Hubble function   &lt;math&gt;H=\frac{\dot a}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
* The critical density   &lt;math&gt;\rho_c=\frac{3}{8\pi}H^2&lt;/math&gt;
* The ''i''-th dimensionless energy density   &lt;math&gt;\Omega_i=\frac{\rho_i}{\rho_c}&lt;/math&gt;

* The redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; given by the formula   &lt;math&gt;1+z=\frac{a_0}{a(t)}&lt;/math&gt;

Any function with a zero subscript denote the function evaluated at the present time &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt;). The last term can be taken to be &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; including the curvature state equation.&lt;ref name="Evolution2"&gt;{{cite journal

:&lt;math&gt; H(z)=H_0\sqrt{\sum \Omega_{i0}(1+z)^{n_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_i=3(1+\omega_i)&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the addition ranges over all possible partial constituents and in particular there can be countably infinitely many. With this notation we have:&lt;ref name="Evolution2" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{The particle horizon } H_p \text{ exists if and only if } N&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the largest &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; (possibly infinite). The evolution of the particle horizon for an expanding universe (&lt;math&gt;\dot{a}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;) is:&lt;ref name="Evolution2" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dH_p}{dt}=H_p(z)H(z)+c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light and can be taken to be &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; (natural units). Notice that the derivative is made with respect to the FLRW-time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, while the functions are evaluated at the redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; which are related as stated before. We have an analogous but slightly different result for [[event horizon]].

==Horizon problem==
{{main|Horizon problem}}
The concept of a particle horizon can be used to illustrate the famous horizon problem, which is an unresolved issue associated with the [[Big Bang]] model. Extrapolating back to the time of [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] when the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) was emitted, we obtain a particle horizon of about

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; H_p(t_\text{CMB}) = c\eta_\text{CMB} = 284\text{ Mpc} = 8.9 \times 10^{-3} H_p(t_0) &lt;/math&gt;}}

which corresponds to a proper size at that time of:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; a_\text{CMB}H_p(t_\text{CMB}) = 261\text{ kpc} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Since we observe the CMB to be emitted essentially from our particle horizon (&lt;math&gt;284\text{ Mpc} \ll 14.4\text{ Gpc}&lt;/math&gt;), our expectation is that parts of the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) that are separated by about a fraction of a [[great circle]] across the sky of

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{H_p(t_\text{CMB})}{H_p(t_0)}&lt;/math&gt;}}

(an [[angular size]] of &lt;math&gt;\theta \sim 1.7^\circ&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmic Microwave Background Temperature Power Spectrum|url=http://www.roe.ac.uk/ifa/postgrad/pedagogy/2006_tojeiro.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; should be out of [[causal contact]] with each other. That the entire CMB is in [[thermal equilibrium]] and approximates a [[blackbody]] so well is therefore not explained by the standard explanations about the way the [[expansion of the universe]] proceeds. The most popular resolution to this problem is [[cosmic inflation]].

A '''preservative''' is a substance or a chemical that is added to products such as food, beverages, [[pharmaceutical drugs]], paints, biological samples, cosmetics, wood, and many other products to prevent [[decomposition]] by [[microbial]] growth or by undesirable [[Chemical reaction|chemical changes]]. In general, preservation is implemented in two modes, chemical and physical. Chemical preservation entails adding [[chemical compound]]s to the product. Physical preservation entails processes such as refrigeration or drying.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Erich Lück and Gert-Wolfhard von Rymon Lipinski "Foods, 3. Food Additives" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a11_561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preservative [[food additive]]s reduce the risk of [[Foodborne illness|foodborne infections]], decrease microbial spoilage, and preserve fresh attributes and nutritional quality.  Some physical techniques for food preservation include dehydration, UV-C radiation, freeze-drying, and refrigeration. Chemical preservation and physical preservation techniques are sometimes combined.

==Antimicrobial preservatives==
Antimicrobial preservatives prevent degradation by bacteria. This method is the most traditional and ancient type of preserving—ancient methods such as pickling and adding honey prevent microorganism growth by modifying the pH level. The most commonly used antimicrobial preservative is [[lactic acid]]. Common antimicrobial preservatives are presented in the table.&lt;ref name= Msagati/&gt;&lt;ref name="CEN-1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalton|first=Louisa|title=Food Preservatives|journal=Chemical and Engineering News|date=November 2002|volume=80|issue=45|pages=40|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/science/8045/8045sci2.html|accessdate=9 February 2012|doi=10.1021/cen-v080n045.p040}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Preservatives|url=http://www.understandingfoodadditives.org/pages/Ch2p5-3.htm|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nitrate]]s and [[nitrite]]s are also antimicrobial.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Ian C.

==Antioxidants==
[[Image:Lipid peroxidation.svg|thumb|right|The [[Radical (chemistry)|free radical]] pathway for the first phase of the oxidative rancidification of fats.  This process is slowed by antioxidants.]]

The oxidation process spoils most food, especially those with a high fat content.  Fats quickly [[rancidification|turn rancid]] when exposed to oxygen. Antioxidants prevent or inhibit the oxidation process. The most common antioxidant additives are [[ascorbic acid]] ([[vitamin C]] ) and ascorbates.&lt;ref name=Bhat/&gt; Thus, antioxidants are commonly added to oils, cheese, and chips.&lt;ref name= Msagati&gt;Msagati, Titus A.

Retrieved from http://www.eblib.com&lt;/ref&gt; Other antioxidants include the [[phenol]] derivatives [[Butylated hydroxyanisole|BHA]], [[Butylated hydroxytoluene|BHT]], [[tert-Butylhydroquinone|TBHQ]] and [[propyl gallate]].  These agents suppress the formation of hydroperoxides.&lt;ref name="CEN-1" /&gt; Other preservatives include [[ethanol]] and [[methylchloroisothiazolinone]].

A variety of agents are added to sequester (deactivate) metal ions that otherwise catalyze the oxidation of fats.  Common sequestering agents are [[EDTA|disodium EDTA]], [[citric acid]] (and citrates), [[tartaric acid]], and [[lecithin]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

==Nonsynthetic compounds for food preservation==
[[Citric acid|Citric]] and [[ascorbic acid]]s target [[enzymes]] that degrade fruits and vegetables, e.g., [[mono/polyphenol oxidase]] which turns surfaces of cut apples and potatoes brown. [[Ascorbic acid]] and [[tocopherol]], which are vitamins, are common preservatives.  [[Smoking (cooking)|Smoking]] entails exposing food to a variety of phenols, which are antioxidants.  Natural preservatives include [[rosemary]] and [[oregano]] extract,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Riva Pomerantz|date=Nov 15, 2017|title=KOSHER IN THE LAB|magazine=[[Ami (magazine)|Ami]]|issue=342|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hops]], [[salt]], [[sugar]], [[vinegar]], [[Ethanol|alcohol]], [[diatomaceous earth]] and [[castor oil]].

Traditional preservatives, such as sodium benzoate have raised health concerns in the past. Benzoate was shown in a study to cause hypersensitivity in some asthma sufferers. This has caused reexamination of natural preservatives which occur in vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=P'EREZ-D'IAZ|first=I.M|author2=MCFEETERS, R.F|title=Preservation of Acidified Cucumbers with a Natural Preservative Combination of Fumaric Acid and Allyl Isothiocyanate that Target Lactic Acid Bacteria and Yeasts.|journal=Journal of Food Science|date=May 2010|volume=75|issue=4|pages=M204-M208|doi=10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01587.x|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=43163&amp;content=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and methods==
Preservatives have been used since prehistoric times. [[Smoked meat]] for example has [[phenol]]s and other chemicals that delay spoilage. The preservation of foods has evolved greatly over the centuries and has been instrumental in increasing food security. The use of preservatives other than traditional oils, salts, paints, etc. in food began in the late 19th century, but was not widespread until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Evans, G., de Challemaison, B., &amp; Cox, D. N. | date = 2010 | title = Consumers’ ratings of the natural and unnatural qualities of foods | journal = Appetite | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 557–563 | doi = 10.1016/j.appet.2010.02.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of food preservatives varies greatly depending on the country. Many developing countries that do not have strong governments to regulate food additives face either harmful levels of preservatives in foods or a complete avoidance of foods that are considered unnatural or foreign. These countries have also proven useful in case studies surrounding chemical preservatives, as they have been only recently introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Ashagrie, Z. Z., &amp; Abate, D. D. (2012). IMPROVEMENT OF INJERA SHELF LIFE THROUGH THE USE OF CHEMICAL PRESERVATIVES. African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition &amp; Development, 12(5), 6409-6423.&lt;/ref&gt; In urban slums of highly populated countries, the knowledge about contents of food tends to be extremely low, despite consumption of these imported foods.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, H., Jha, A., Taneja, K. K., Kabra, K., &amp; Sadiq, H. M. (2013).

National Journal of Community Medicine, 4(3), 402-406.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drying ===
{{Main|Food drying}}

In ancient times the sun and wind naturally dried out foods. Middle Eastern and Oriental cultures started drying foods in 1,200 B.C. in the sun. The Romans used a lot of dry fruit. In the Middle Ages, the people made “still houses” where fruits, vegetables, and herbs were could dry out in climates that did not have strong sunlight for drying. Sometimes fires were made to create heat to dry foods. Drying prevents yeasts and bread molds (''[[Rhizopus]]'') from growing by removing moisture so bacteria cannot grow.&lt;ref name="nchfp.uga.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/nchfp/factsheets/food_pres_hist.html|title=National Center for Home Food Preservation {{!}} NCHFP Publications|website=nchfp.uga.edu|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.extension.umn.edu/food/food-safety/preserving/drying/methods-for-drying-food-at-home/|title=Methods for Drying Food at Home : Drying : Preserving and Preparing : Food Safety : Food : University of Minnesota Extension|website=www.extension.umn.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freezing ===
{{Main|Frozen food}}

Cellars, caves, and cool streams were used for freezing. American estates had ice houses built to store ice and food on the ice. Icehouse was then converted to an “[[icebox]]”. Icebox was converted in the 1800s to mechanical refrigeration. [[Clarence Birdseye]] found in the 1800s that freezing meats and vegetables at a low temperature made them taste better.&lt;ref name="nchfp.uga.edu"/&gt;

=== Fermenting ===
{{Main|Fermentation in food processing}}

Fermenting was discovered when a few grains of barley were left in the rain and turned into beer. [[Microorganism]]s ferment the starch-derived sugars into alcohols. This is also how fruits are fermented into wine and cabbage into [[Kimchi]] or sauerkraut. Anthropologists believe that as early as 10,000 B.C people began to settle and grow barley. They began to make beer and believed that it was a gift from gods. It was used to preserve foods and to create more nutritious foods from less desirable ingredients. Vitamins are produced through fermentation by [[microorganism]]s making the end product more nutritious.&lt;ref name="nchfp.uga.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fyi.uwex.edu/safepreserving/2013/09/23/safe-preserving-fermented-foods/|title=Safe Preserving: Fermented Foods|work=Safe and Healthy: Preserving Food at Home|access-date=2017-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pickling ===
{{Main|Pickling}}

Pickling occurs when foods are placed in a container with vinegar or another acid. It is thought that pickling came about when people used to place food in wine or beer to preserve it due to them having a low [[pH]]. Containers had to be stoneware or glass (vinegar will dissolve metal from pots). After the food was eaten, the pickling [[brine]] had other uses. Romans would make a concentrated pickle sauce called “[[garum]]”. It was very concentrated and the dish that it would be used in would only need a few drops to get the fish taste. Due to new foods arriving from Europe in the 16th century, food preservation increased. Ketchup originated from Europe as an oriental fish brine and when it made it to America, sugar was added. Pickling sauces were soon part of many recipes such as chutneys, relish, piccalilli, mustard, and ketchup when different spices were added to them.&lt;ref name="nchfp.uga.edu"/&gt;

=== Curing ===
{{Main|Curing (food preservation)|Salting (food)}}

The beginning of curing was done through dehydration. Salting was used by early cultures to help desiccate foods. Many different salts were used from different places such as rock salt, sea salt, spiced salt, etc.. People began to experiment and found in the 1800s that some salts gave meat an appealing red color instead of the grey that they were used to. During their experimenting in the 1920s they realized this mixture of salts were [[nitrate]]s (saltpeter) that prevented [[Clostridium botulinum]] growth.&lt;ref name="nchfp.uga.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/nchfp/lit_rev/cure_smoke_cure.html|title=Curing and Smoking Meats for Home Food Preservation|website=nchfp.uga.edu|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jam and Jelly ===
{{Main|Fruit preserves}}

The early cultures also used honey or sugar as a preservative. Greece used a [[quince]] and honey mixture with a slight amount of drying and then tightly packed into jars. The Romans used the same technique but instead cooked the honey and [[quince]] mixture to make a solid texture. The Indian and Oriental traders brought [[sugarcane]] to the northern climates where housewives were then able to learn to make preservatives by heating fruit with the [[sugarcane]].&lt;ref name="nchfp.uga.edu"/&gt;

=== Canning ===
{{Main|Canning}}

Canning started in 1790 from a French confectioner, [[Nicolas Appert]], when he found that by applying heat to food in sealed glass bottles, the food is free from spoilage. Appert’s ideas were tried by the French Navy with meat, vegetables, fruit, and milk in 1806. An Englishman, [[Peter Durand]] decided to use Appert’s method on tin cans in 1810. Even though Appert found a method that worked, he did not understand why it worked because many believed that the lack of air caused the preservation. In 1864 [[Louis Pasteur]] linked food spoilage/illness to [[microorganism]]s. Different foods are placed into jars or cans and heated to a [[microorganism]] and [[enzyme]] inactivating temperature. They are then cooled forming a vacuum seal which prevents [[microorganism]]s from contaminating the foods.&lt;ref name="nchfp.uga.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thespruce.com/brief-history-of-canning-food-1327429|title=The Brief History of Canning Food|work=The Spruce|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public awareness of food preservation==
Public awareness of food preservatives is uneven.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, H. N. Harsha; Jha, Anshu Kumar; Taneja, Khushboo K.; Kabra, Krishan; Sadiq, Hafeez M. (2013). A Study On Consumer Awareness, Safety Perceptions &amp; Practices about Food Preservatives and Flavouring Agents used in Packed/Canned Foods from South India. National Journal of Community Medicine, 4(3), 402.&lt;/ref&gt; Americans have a perception that food-borne illnesses happen more often in other countries. This may be true, but the occurrence of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths are still high. It is estimated by the [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) that each year there are 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths linked to food-borne illness.&lt;ref name="Theron, M. M. 2007"&gt;Theron, M. M. &amp; Lues, J. F. (2007). Organic acids and meat preservation: A review. Food Reviews  International, 23, 141-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing demand for ready-to-eat fresh food products has led to challenges for food distributors regarding the safety and quality of their foods. Artificial preservatives meet some of these challenges by preserving freshness for longer periods of time, but these preservatives can cause negative side-effects as well. [[Sodium nitrite]] is a preservative used in lunch meats, [[ham]]s, [[sausage]]s, [[hot dog]]s, and [[bacon]] to prevent [[botulism]]. It serves the important function of controlling the [[bacteria]] that cause [[botulism]], but [[sodium nitrite]] can react with [[proteins]], or during cooking at high heats, to form [[Carcinogen|carcinogenic N-nitrosamines]].&lt;ref name=Field&gt;{{cite book | author = Field, Simon Quellen | date = 2008 | title = Why There's Antifreeze in Your Toothpaste: The Chemistry of Household Ingredients | location = Chicago | publisher = Chicago Review Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{medrs|date=March 2015}} It has also been linked to [[cancer]] in lab animals.&lt;ref name= Antinoro&gt;Antinoro, L. (2008). EN Rates 12 Common Food Additives As Safe Or Sorry Ingredients. (Cover story).

For over 30 years, there has been a debate about whether or not preservatives and other [[food additives]] can cause [[hyperactivity]]. Studies have found that there may be increases in [[hyperactivity]] amongst children who consume artificial colorings and [[benzoate]] preservatives and who are already genetically predisposed to hyperactivity, but these studies were not entirely conclusive. [[Hyperactivity]] only increased moderately, and it was not determined if the preservatives, colorings, or a combination of the two were responsible for the increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrett | first1 = J.

Saint-Gobain SEFPRO ('''S'''intered and '''E'''lectro'''f'''used '''Pro'''ducts), founded in 1929, produces refractories for the glass industry. The company consists of plants, sales offices and Research and Development Centers employing over 2200 people across four continents, with headquarters in [[Le Pontet, Vaucluse]], France. The group belongs to the ‘Innovative Materials’ division of the [[Saint-Gobain]] group.

==History==

The first electro-fused product was invented and developed in the 1920s by the laboratory of Corning Glass Works, the American glassmaker partnered with Hartford Empire Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boch|first1=Philippe|title=Ceramic Materials: Processes, Properties, and Applications|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lnN1rcr4unoC&amp;dq=electrofused+products+corning+glass+works&amp;hl=fr&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production began at Corhart Refractories Co., a Corning subsidiary, in 1927.

In 1929, a joint venture between Corning and Saint-Gobain, another leading glassmaker, established ‘L’Electro-Réfractaire" in [[Modane]], France, with their principal product the Corhart Standard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saint-gobain350ans.com/#!/fr/les-dates-clefs-de-notre-histoire/revolution-technologique-pour-les-fours-verriers&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940, the company was producing 2000 tons of the product per year. In 1942, a new, even more hard-wearing product was introduced: Corhart ZAC. New, pure raw materials were used, such as Zircon, Alumina and Silica (later known as AZS). During the Second World War, the Modane factory was destroyed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Veyret-Verner|first1=Germaine|title=La Maurienne industrielle: destructions et reconstructions|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rga_0035-1121_1945_num_33_3_5196?_Prescripts_Search_tabs1=standard&amp;|website=Persée: Revues Scientifiques|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, a new production site was selected in Le Pontet, located in the department of Vaucluse in France, some 350&amp;nbsp;km from the original location. This would later become the group's headquarters. Workers from the Modane plant relocated to Vaucluse to work in the new factory.

The choice of location was due, in part, to the proximity of necessary raw materials, such as the purest white bauxite in Europe, alumina provided by the company Péchiney in Gardanne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Colombardi|first1=Bruno|title=Alcan ne prend pas d'engagement sur l'avenir de Pechiney|url=http://www.ville-gardanne.fr/Alcan-ne-prend-pas-d-engagement?var_recherche=pechiney|website=Gardanne: Terre d'Energie|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the silica sand of the [[Mont Ventoux]] region. It was also in close proximity to the port city of [[Marseille]] and the Rhone, valuable for its hydro-electric energy.

In 1952, a Research and Development center was established next to the Le Pontet factory. The company focused on innovation and was granted multiple patents from the 1960s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/fra/brevet/633153/sommaire.html?query=&amp;start=&amp;num=&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.ne/patents/US4119472&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.sn/patents/US4018864&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, "L’Electro-Réfractaires" merged with the Société Générale de Produits Réfractaires, based in Vénissieux, France, to form the "Société Européenne des Produits Réfractaires" ([[Société Européenne des Produits Réfractaires|SEPR]]). The group finally became Saint-Gobain SEFPRO in 2001.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13315">[[File:LRAD naval.jpg|thumb|A Long-Range Acoustic Device ([[LRAD]]) in use on the [[USS Blue Ridge (LCC-19)|USS ''Blue Ridge'']]]]'''Sonic and ultrasonic weapons''' ('''USW''') are weapons of various types that use sound to injure, incapacitate, or kill an opponent. Some sonic weapons are currently in limited use or in research and development by [[military]] and [[police]] forces. Some of these weapons have been described as sonic bullets, sonic [[grenade]]s, sonic [[Land mine|mines]], or sonic [[cannon]]s. Some make a focused beam of [[sound]] or [[ultrasound]]; some make an area field of sound.

== Use and deployment ==
[[File:Long Range Acoustic Device 500X in New York City.jpg|thumb|An [[NYPD]] officer stands ready with the [[LRAD]] 500X at an [[Occupy Wall Street]] protest on November 17, 2011 near the city hall]]

Extremely high-power sound waves can disrupt or destroy the [[eardrum]]s of a target and cause severe pain or disorientation. This is usually sufficient to incapacitate a person.  Less powerful sound waves can cause humans to experience nausea or discomfort. The use of these frequencies to incapacitate persons has occurred both in anti-citizen special operation and crowd control settings.

The possibility of a device that produces frequency that causes vibration of the eyeballs—and therefore distortion of vision—was suggested by [[paranormal]] researcher [[Vic Tandy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/infrasound.html|title=infrasound - The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com|website=skepdic.com|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tandy V.|author2=Lawrence, T|last-author-amp=yes |date=1998 |title=The ghost in the machine |journal=Journal of the Society for Psychical Research |issue=62 |pages=360–64  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s while attempting to demystify a "haunting" in his laboratory in [[Coventry]].  This "spook" was characterised by a feeling of unease and vague glimpses of a grey apparition.  Some detective work implicated a newly installed extractor fan that, Tandy found, was generating [[infrasound]] of 18.9&amp;nbsp;Hz, 0.3&amp;nbsp;Hz, and 9&amp;nbsp;Hz.

A [[long range acoustic device|long-range acoustic device]] has been used by the crew of the cruise ship ''[[Seabourn Spirit]]'' to deter [[pirates]] who chased and attacked the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4418748.stm|title=Cruise lines turn to sonic weapon|date=2005-11-08|accessdate=2010-09-30|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More commonly this device and others of similar design have been used to disperse protesters and rioters in crowd control efforts.  A similar system is called a "magnetic acoustic device" "[[The Mosquito|The mosquito]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4857417|title=Focused Sound 'Laser' for Crowd Control|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Mosquito|'Mobile' sonic device]]s have been used in the United Kingdom to deter teenagers from lingering around shops in target areas. The device works by emitting an ultra-high frequency blast (around 19–20&amp;nbsp;kHz) that teenagers or people under approximately 20 are susceptible to and find uncomfortable. Age-related hearing loss apparently prevents the ultra-high pitch sound from causing a nuisance to those in their late twenties and above, though this is wholly dependent on a young person's past exposure to high sound pressure levels.

High-amplitude sound of a specific pattern at a frequency close to the sensitivity peak of human hearing (2–3&amp;nbsp;kHz) is used as a burglar deterrent.&lt;ref&gt;http://inferno.se/pdf/eng-test-hearinglossrisk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Some police forces have used sound cannons against protesters, for example during the [[2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2009/sep/25/sonic-cannon-g20-pittsburgh | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=G20 protesters blasted by sonic cannon | first=Matthew | last=Weaver | date=2009-09-25 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the 2014 [[Ferguson unrest]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkve7q/the-new-sound-of-crowd-control The New Sound of Crowd Control]&lt;/ref&gt;, the 2016 [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] protest in North Dakota&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Watch: Shots reportedly fired, 141 arrested at Dakota Access Pipeline protests|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/live-updates-from-the-dakota-access-pipeline-protests-oct-27/|accessdate=6 December 2016|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, among others.

It has been reported that [[Embassy attack accusations in Cuba|"sonic attacks" may have taken place in Cuba]] in 2016 and 2017, leading to health problems, including hearing loss, in US and Canadian government employees at the US and Canadian embassies in Havana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The US issued an alert to its employees in China after it learned of a possible "sonic attack" on a US citizen working there. The employee complained of symptoms from late 2017 through April 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Research==
{{See also|United States Department of Defense policy on non-lethal weapons}}

Studies have found that exposure to high intensity [[ultrasound]] at frequencies from 700&amp;nbsp;kHz to 3.6&amp;nbsp;MHz can cause lung and intestinal damage in mice.  Heart rate patterns following vibroacoustic stimulation has resulted in serious negative consequences such as atrial flutter and bradycardia.&lt;ref&gt;Exploiting Technical Opportunities to Capture Advanced Capabilities for Our Soldiers; Army AL&amp;T; 2007 Oct-Dec; Dr. Reed Skaggs [http://asc.army.mil/docs/pubs/alt/2007/4_OctNovDec/articles/16_Exploiting_Technical_Opportunities_to_Capture_Advanced_Capabilities_for_Our_Soldiers_200710.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Air University Research Template:  "NON-LETHAL WEAPONS: SETTING OUR PHASERS ON STUN? Potential Strategic Blessings and Curses of Non-Lethal Weapons on the Battlefield"; Erik L. Nutley, Lieutenant Colonel, USAF; August 2003; Occasional Paper No. 34; Center for Strategy and Technology; Air War College; Air University; Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama; PG12 [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/csat34.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327041253/http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/csat34.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extra-aural (unrelated to hearing) bioeffects on various internal organs and the central nervous system included auditory shifts, vibrotactile sensitivity change, muscle contraction, cardiovascular function change, central nervous system effects, vestibular (inner ear) effects, and chest wall/lung tissue effects.  Researchers found that low frequency sonar exposure could result in significant cavitations, hypothermia, and tissue shearing.  No follow up experiments were recommended.  Tests performed on mice show the threshold for both lung and liver damage occurs at about 184&amp;nbsp;dB.  Damage increases rapidly as intensity is increased.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  The [[American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine]] (AIUM) has stated that there have been no proven biological effects associated with an unfocused sound beam with intensities below 100&amp;nbsp;mW/cm² SPTA or focused sound beams below an intensity level of 1&amp;nbsp;mW/cm² SPTA.&lt;ref&gt;"Ultrasound Physics 2nd edition"; Terry Reynolds, BS RDCS; School of Cardiac Ultrasound, Arizona Heart Foundation, Phoenix, AZ; 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noise-induced neurologic disturbances in scuba divers exposed to continuous low frequency tones for durations longer than 15 minutes has involved in some cases the development of immediate and long-term problems affecting brain tissue. The symptoms resembled those of individuals who had suffered minor head injuries. One theory for a causal mechanism is that the prolonged sound exposure resulted in enough mechanical strain to brain tissue to induce an [[encephalopathy]].  Divers and aquatic mammals may also suffer lung and sinus injuries from high intensity, low frequency sound. This is due to the ease with which low frequency sound passes from water into a body, but not into any pockets of gas in the body, which reflect the sound due to mismatched acoustic impedance.&lt;ref&gt;“Non-Lethal Swimmer Neutralization Study”; [[Applied Research Laboratories]]; The [[University of Texas at Austin]]; [[G2 Software Systems]], Inc., San Diego; TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 3138; May 2002 [http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sti/publications/pubs/td/3138/td3138cond.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427061028/http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sti/publications/pubs/td/3138/td3138cond.pdf |date=2006-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Syneresis''' (also spelled 'synæresis' or 'synaeresis'), in chemistry, is the [[solvent extraction|extraction]] or expulsion of a [[liquid]] from a [[gel]], as when [[Serum (blood)|serum]] drains from a contracting [[clot]] of [[blood]].  Another example of syneresis is the collection of [[whey]] on the surface of [[yogurt]].  Syneresis can also be observed when the amount of diluent in a swollen polymer exceeds the solubility limit as the temperature changes.  A household example of this is the counter intuitive expulsion of water from dry gelatin when the temperature increases. Syneresis has also been proposed as the mechanism of formation of the [[Silicon dioxide|amorphous silicate]] composing the [[frustule]] of [[diatom]]s.

In the processing of dairy [[milk]], for example during [[cheese making]], syneresis is the formation of the [[curd]] due to the sudden removal of the [[hydrophilic]] [[peptides|macropeptides]], which causes an imbalance in intermolecular forces.  Bonds between [[hydrophobic]] sites start to develop and are enforced by [[calcium]] bonds which form as the water molecules in the [[micelles]] start to leave the structure.  This process is usually referred to as the phase of coagulation and syneresis.  The splitting of the bond between residues 105 and 106 in the [[casein|&amp;kappa;-casein]] molecule is often called the primary phase of the [[rennet]] action, while the phase of coagulation and syneresis is referred to as the secondary phase.

In cooking, syneresis is the sudden release of moisture contained within protein molecules, usually caused by excessive heat, which over-hardens the protein shell. Moisture inside expands upon heating. The hard protein shell pops, expelling the moisture.

This process is what changes juicy rare steak to dry steak when well-done. It creates weeping in scrambled eggs, with dry protein curd swimming in released moisture. It causes emulsified sauces, such as hollandaise, to "break". It creates unsightly moisture pockets within baked custard dishes such as flan or crème brûlée.

In dentistry, syneresis is the expulsion of water or other liquid molecules from dental impression materials (alginate for example) after an impression has been taken. Due to this process, the impression shrinks a little and therefore its size is no longer accurate. For this reason, many dental impression companies strongly recommend to pour the dental cast as soon as possible to prevent distortion of the dimension of the teeth and objects in the impression.

The opposite process of syneresis is [[imbibition]], meaning, a material that absorbs water molecules from the surrounding. Alginate is also an example of imbibition since if soaked in water, it will absorb it.

The '''Taishan Nuclear Power Plant''' ({{zh|t=台山核电站|p=Táishān Hédiànzhàn}}) is under construction in [[Chixizhen]], [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]], [[Guangdong province]], [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90883/6849430.html|title=Taishan nuclear power plant to be one of world's largest|author=|last=|first=|authorlink=|date=December 22, 2009|work=[[People's Daily]]|publisher=|accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The plant features two of [[Areva]]'s [[European Pressurized Reactor]] (EPR).
It was planned to go online in 2013 and to be the third site to house EPR units.
However, the start of operation has been postponed to late 2018. Also, delays in other EPR construction sites mean that Taishan will probably be the first nuclear power plant with an operational EPR unit. One of the two reactors, Taishan 1, came online and was connected to the grid in August 2018.
The project is owned by Guangdong Taishan Nuclear Power Joint Venture Company Limited (TNPC), which is 70% owned by [[China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group]] (CGNPC) and 30% by [[Électricité de France]] (EDF).

Each generator delivers 1750&amp;nbsp;MWe ([[Nameplate capacity]]); generators of that size are the largest single-piece electrical generators. 
The 495 tonne generator stator is built by [[Dongfang Electric]]. 
Of the 1750&amp;nbsp;MWe gross delivered, around 90&amp;nbsp;MWe will be used by plant systems such as the large pumps that circulate cooling water, leaving 1660&amp;nbsp;MWe net for supply to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Taishan_generator_lift_1110131.html|title=The generator stator for the Taishan 1 EPR has arrived on site and been hoisted into place for installation|author=|last=|first=|authorlink=|date=October 11, 2013|work=[[World Nuclear News]]|publisher=|accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
On August 26, 2008, excavation work began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgnpc.com.cn/n2881959/n3075227/n3075259/n3075392/index.html|title=NPP under construction|work=|publisher=China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group|accessdate=2010-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102175631/http://www.cgnpc.com.cn/n2881959/n3075227/n3075259/n3075392/index.html|archivedate=2011-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first concrete for the first unit was poured in October 2009.&lt;ref name="wna-China"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html|title=Nuclear Power in China|date=29 November 2010|work=Information Papers|publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] (WNA)|accessdate= 2010-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Construction of each unit was planned to take 46&amp;nbsp;months, significantly faster and cheaper than the first two EPRs in Finland and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-24/china-builds-french-designed-nuclear-reactor-for-40-less-areva-ceo-says.html|title=China Builds Nuclear Reactor for 40% Less Than Cost in France, Areva Says|first=Tara|last=Patel|first2=Francois|last2=de&amp;nbsp;Beaupuy|date=2010-11-24|work=|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate= 2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans have proved elusive as start up has been repeatedly delayed.  In February 2017 after 88 months of construction, CGNPC announced that completion of the reactors would be delayed until the second half of 2017 and the first half of 2018.&lt;ref name=mailonline&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4245692/China-delays-nuclear-reactor-start-again.html|title=China delays nuclear reactor start again|newspaper= [[Mail Online]] |date= 2017-02-21|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In spite of this announcement, completion of the plant was delayed. In December 2017, Hong Kong media reported that a boiler had cracked during testing, and that welding on the component was considered "problematic". Neither the nuclear plant's operators nor the manufacturer of the affected component responded to the news agency's request for comment.&lt;ref name="crackinkey"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tests reveal crack in key component of Chinese nuclear power plant, 130 km west of Hong Kong|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/12/12/tests-reveal-crack-key-component-chinese-nuclear-power-plant-130km-west-hong-kong/|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]|agency=[[FactWire]]|date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@factwire/a-battle-for-transparency-two-years-of-holding-taishan-nuclear-power-plant-accountable-4765402f9180&lt;/ref&gt; The boiler was later found to be a deareator, which removes dissolved oxygen from water by heating it.

In January 2018 commissioning was rescheduled, with commercial operation expected in 2018.&lt;ref name=wnn-20180102&gt;{{cite news |url=http://world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Taishan-schedule-factors-in-commissioning-tests-0201181.html |title=Taishan schedule factors in commissioning tests |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=2 January 2018 |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 2018, the Official Letter of Approving the Initial Fuel Loading of the first unit of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant was issued by the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA). Taishan Unit 1 began fuel loading at 18:18 on April 10, marking the beginning of fuel loading of the first reactor using the third-generation nuclear power technology EPR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.eastmoney.com/news/1355,20180410855215266.html |title=中法合资广东台山核电站1号机组装料在即 |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First criticality was achieved at Taishan Unit 1 on June 6, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First criticality achieved at Chinese EPR|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-First-criticality-achieved-at-Chinese-EPR-0706184.html|accessdate=23 June 2018|work=www.world-nuclear-news.org|date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 29, 2018, Taishan 1 was connected to the grid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taishan 1, world’s first EPR connected to the grid|url=https://www.edfenergy.com/media-centre/news-releases/taishan-1-connected-to-grid?sf192828684=1|website=EDF Energy|accessdate=30 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China's Taishan 1 reactor connected to grid|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Chinas-Taishan-1-reactor-connected-to-grid-29061801.html|accessdate=5 July 2018|work=www.world-nuclear-news.org|date=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3374">'''Tokyo tanks''' were internally mounted [[self-sealing fuel tanks]] used in the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bombers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1943/1943%20-%202651.html Drop Tanks] November 4th, 1943 ''Flight'' p513&lt;/ref&gt; during [[World War II]]. Although nicknamed "[[Tokyo]]" tanks to dramatically illustrate the significant range they added to the B-17 (approximately 40% greater with combat weights), it was also an exaggeration in that no B-17 ever had the range to bomb [[Japan]] from any base in World War II.

== Description ==
These fuel tanks consisted of eighteen removable rubberized-compound containers, called cells, installed inside the main wings of the airplane, nine to each side. The main wings of the B-17 consisted of an "inboard wing" structural panel mounted to the fuselage and mounting the [[engines]] and [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]], and an "outboard wing" structural panel joined to the inboard wing and carrying only the [[aileron]]s. The Tokyo tanks were installed on either side of the joint (a [[Structural engineering|load-bearing]] point) where the two wing portions were connected. Five cells, totalling {{convert|270|USgal|L}} capacity, sat side by side in the outboard wing and were joined by a fuel line to the main tank delivering fuel to the outermost engine. The sixth cell was located in the space where the wing sections joined, with the remaining three cells located side-by-side within the inboard wing, and these four cells delivered {{convert|270|USgal|L}} of fuel to the feeder tank for the inboard engine. The same arrangement was repeated on the opposite wing. The Tokyo tanks added {{convert|1,080|USgal|L}} of fuel to the {{convert|1,700|USgal|L}} carried in the six regular wing tanks and the {{convert|820|USgal|L}} that could be carried in a tank that could be mounted in the bomb bay, for a combined total of {{convert|3,600|USgal|L}}.

All B-17F aircraft built by Boeing from Block 80, by [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]] from Block 25, and by [[Vega Aircraft Company|Vega]] from Block 30 were equipped with Tokyo tanks, and the entire run of B-17Gs had Tokyo tanks. These B-17s with factory-mounted Tokyo tanks were first introduced to the [[Eighth Air Force]] in [[England]] in April 1943 with the arrival of the 94th and 95th Bomb Groups. In June 1943 aircraft that were so equipped began to appear in greater numbers as replacement aircraft, and from the beginning of July, 1943, all replacement aircraft that did not have the tanks were equipped before issue.

Although the tanks were removable, this could only be done by first removing the outboard wing panel, and so was not a routine maintenance task. A drawback to the tanks was that there was no means of measuring remaining fuel quantity within the cells. Fuel was moved from the cells to the engine tanks by opening control [[valve]]s within the bomb bay so that the fuel drained by gravity. Although the tanks were specified as self-sealing, vapor buildup within partially drained tanks made them explosive hazards in combat.

'''Triboluminescence''' is an [[optical phenomenon]] in which [[light]] is generated through the breaking of [[chemical bond]]s in a material when it is pulled apart, ripped, scratched, crushed, or rubbed (see [[tribology]]). The phenomenon is not fully understood, but appears to be caused by the separation and reunification of electrical charges.  The term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wiktionary:τρίβω|τρίβειν]] ("to rub"; see [[tribology]]) and the [[Latin]] ''lumen'' (light).  Triboluminescence can be observed when breaking sugar crystals and peeling adhesive tapes.

''Triboluminescence'' is often used as a synonym for ''fractoluminescence'' (a term sometimes used when referring only to light emitted from fractured crystals).  Triboluminescence differs from [[piezoluminescence]] in that a piezoluminescent material emits light when it is deformed, as opposed to broken.  These are examples of [[mechanoluminescence]], which is [[luminescence]] resulting from any mechanical action on a [[solid]].

==History==
[[Image:UteQuartzRattle.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An [[Uncompahgre Ute]] Buffalo rawhide ceremonial rattle filled with quartz crystals. Flashes of light are visible when the quartz crystals are subjected to mechanical stress in darkness.]]

=== Uncompahgre Ute Indians ===
The [[Uncompahgre Ute]] Indians from Central Colorado are one of the first documented groups of people in the world credited with the application of [[mechanoluminescence]] involving the use of quartz crystals to generate light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bang/handson/sugar_glow.shtml BBC Big Bang on triboluminescence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Dawson ''Changing colors: now you see them, now you don't'' Coloration Technology 2010 {{doi|10.1111/j.1478-4408.2010.00247.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ute constructed special ceremonial rattles made from buffalo rawhide which they filled with clear quartz crystals collected from the mountains of Colorado and Utah.  When the rattles were shaken at night during ceremonies, the friction and mechanical stress of the quartz crystals impacting together produced flashes of light visible through the translucent buffalo hide.

===Later descriptions===
The first recorded observation is attributed to English scholar [[Francis Bacon]] when he recorded in his 1620 ''[[Novum Organum]]'' that "It is well known that all [[sugar]], whether candied or plain, if it be hard, will sparkle when broken or scraped in the dark."&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Francis. [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/bacon.html ''Novum Organum'']&lt;/ref&gt; The scientist [[Robert Boyle]] also reported on some of his work on triboluminescence in 1663.  In the late 1790s, [[sugar]] production began to produce more refined sugar crystals.  These crystals were formed into a large solid cone for transport and sale.  This solid cone of sugar had to be broken into usable chunks using a device known as [[sugar nips]].  People began to notice that as sugar was "nipped" in low light, tiny bursts of light were visible.

A historically important instance of triboluminescence occurred in Paris in 1675.  Astronomer [[Jean Picard|Jean-Felix Picard]] observed that his [[barometer]] was glowing in the dark as he carried it.  His barometer consisted of a glass tube that was partially filled with mercury.   Whenever the mercury slid down the glass tube, the empty space above the mercury would glow.  While investigating this phenomenon, researchers discovered that static electricity could cause low-pressure air to glow.  This discovery revealed the possibility of electric lighting.&lt;ref&gt;See Wikipedia's article:  [[Barometric light]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==
[[Materials science|Materials scientists]] have not yet arrived at a full understanding of the effect, but the current theory of triboluminescence &amp;mdash; based upon crystallographic, spectroscopic, and other experimental evidence &amp;mdash; is that upon fracture of asymmetrical materials, [[electric charge|charge]] is separated.  When the charges recombine, the electrical discharge ionizes the surrounding air, causing a flash of light. Research further suggests &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that crystals which display triboluminescence must lack symmetry (thus being anisotropic in order to permit charge separation) and be poor conductors.  However, there are substances which break this rule, and which do not possess asymmetry, yet display triboluminescence anyway, such as hexakis(antipyrine)terbium iodide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=W. Clegg, G. Bourhill and I. Sage|title=Hexakis(antipyrine-O)terbium(III) triiodide at 160 K: confirmation of a centrosymmetric structure for a brilliantly triboluminescent complex|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section E| date=April 2002 |volume=58|issue=4|url=http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S1600536802005093|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that these materials contain impurities, which make the substance locally asymmetric.

The biological phenomenon of triboluminescence is conditioned by [[Radical disproportionation|recombination]] of [[free radicals]] during mechanical activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal= Bioluminescence and chemiluminescence| pages= 239–244| first= V.E. | last= Orel | first2= S.B. | last2= Alekseyev | first3= Yu.A. | last3= Grinevich| year=1992 | title=Mechanoluminescence: an assay for lymphocyte analysis in neoplasis |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bio.1170070403/abstract;jsessionid=23CFE9580A9A134C77F852C2C2786A5A.f02t03 | doi=10.1002/bio.1170070403 | volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Tribo.ogv|thumb|Triboluminescence in quartz]]
A [[diamond]] may begin to glow while being rubbed.  This occasionally happens to diamonds while a facet is being ground or the diamond is being sawn during the [[diamond cutting|cutting process]].  Diamonds may fluoresce blue or red.  Some other minerals, such as [[quartz]], are triboluminescent, emitting light when rubbed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhoundingar.com/experiments.php |title=Rockhounding Arkansas: Experiments with Quartz |publisher=Rockhoundingar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, when sugar crystals are crushed, tiny electrical fields are created, separating positive and negative charges that then create [[electric spark|spark]]s while trying to reunite.

Triboluminescence is a biological phenomenon observed in [[Deformation (mechanics)|mechanical deformation]] and [[Contact electrification|contact electrization]] of [[Epidermis|epidermal]] surface of osseous and soft tissues, at chewing food, at [[friction]] in joints of vertebrae, during sexual intercourse, and during [[Circulatory system|blood circulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal=Book: Proceedings of the First International School Biological Luminescence|pages= 131–147 | first= V.E. | last= Orel | year=1989 | title=Triboluminescence as a biological phenomenon and methods for its investigation |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261550609_Triboluminescence_as_a_biological_phenomen_and_methods_for_its_investigation_Ksiaz_Castle_WroclawPoland }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal= Bioluminescence and chemiluminescence| pages= 239–244| first1= V.E. | last1= Orel| first2=S.B. | last2= Alekseyev| first3=Yu.A.| last3=Grinevich| year=1992 | title=Mechanoluminescence: an assay for lymphocyte analysis in neoplasis |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bio.1170070403/abstract;jsessionid=23CFE9580A9A134C77F852C2C2786A5A.f02t03 | doi=10.1002/bio.1170070403 | volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fractoluminescence==
''Fractoluminescence'' is often used as a synonym for triboluminescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/T06499.html |title=IUPAC Gold Book - triboluminescence |publisher=Goldbook.iupac.org |date=2012-08-19 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the emission of light from the [[fracture]] (rather than rubbing) of a [[crystal]], but fracturing often occurs with rubbing.  Depending upon the atomic and [[molecule|molecular]] composition of the crystal, when the crystal fractures a charge separation can occur making one side of the fractured crystal [[electrical charge|positively charged]] and the other side negatively charged.  Like in triboluminescence, if the charge separation results in a large enough [[electric potential]], a [[electrical discharge|discharge]] across the gap and through the bath gas between the interfaces can occur.  The potential at which this occurs depends upon the [[dielectric]] properties of the bath gas.&lt;ref&gt;Note: This phenomenon can be demonstrated by removing ice from a freezer in a darkened room, under conditions in which the ice makes cracking sounds from sudden thermal expansion.  If the ambient light is dim enough, flashes of white light from the cracking ice can be observed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===EMR propagation during fracturing===&lt;!--- Anchor from redirect of [Emission of electromagnetic radiation during fracture]; caution. ---&gt;
The emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EMR) during [[plastic deformation]] and [[crack propagation]] in metals and rocks have been studied. The EMR emissions from metals and alloys have also been explored and confirmed.  Molotskii presented a dislocation mechanism for this type of EMR emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal=Journal of Materials Science|pages= 5634–5643| first=V.S.1 | last=Chauhan  | year=2008  | title=Effects of strain rate and elevated temperature on electromagnetic radiation emission during plastic deformation and crack propagation in ASTM B 265 grade 2 titanium sheets| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10853-008-2590-5#page-1| volume=43 | doi=10.1007/s10853-008-2590-5|bibcode = 2008JMatS..43.5634C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Srilakshmi and Misra reported an additional phenomenon of secondary EMR during plastic deformation and crack propagation in uncoated and metal-coated metals and alloys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

====Theory====
EMR during the micro-plastic deformation and crack propagation from several metals and alloys and transient [[magnetic field]] generation during necking in ferromagnetic metals were reported by Misra (1973–75), which have been confirmed and explored by several researchers. Tudik and Valuev (1980) were able to measure the EMR frequency during tensile fracture of iron and aluminum in the region 1014¬¬ Hz by using [[photomultiplier]]s.  Srilakshmi and Misra (2005a) also reported an additional phenomenon of secondary electromagnetic radiation in uncoated and metal-coated metals and alloys.  If a solid material is subjected to stresses of large amplitudes, which can cause plastic deformation and fracture, emissions such as thermal, acoustic, ions, exo-emissions occur.  With the discovery of new materials and advancement in instrumentation to measure effects of EMR, crack formation and fracture; the EMR emissions effect becomes important.

====Generation of X-Rays====
In a moderate vacuum, peeling tape generated x-rays sufficient to x-ray a human finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal=Nature | last1=Camara | first1=Carlos G. | last2=Escobar | first2=Juan V. | first3=Jonathan R. | last3=Hird | first4=Seth J. |last4=Putterman | year=2008 | title=Correlation between nanosecond X-ray flashes and stick–slip friction in peeling tape | url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07378 | doi=10.1038/nature07378 | volume=455 | pages=1089–1092 | bibcode=2008Natur.455.1089C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deformation induced EMR====
The study of deformation is essential for the development of new materials. Deformation in metals depends on temperature, type of stress applied, strain rate, oxidation and corrosion. Deformation induced EMR can be divided into three categories: effects in ionic crystal materials; effects in rocks and granites; and, effects in metals and alloys.  EMR emission depends on the orientation of the grains in individual crystals since material properties are different in differing directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal=Journal of Zhejiang university science A| pages=1800–1809| first=Rajeev | last=KUMAR  | year=2006  | title=Effect of processing parameters on the electromagnetic radiation emission during plastic deformation and crack propagation in copper-zinc alloys|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631%2Fjzus.2006.A1800#page-1|volume=7|issue=1 | doi=10.1631/jzus.2006.a1800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amplitude of EMR pulse increases as long as the crack continues to grow as new atomic bonds are broken and it leads to EMR. Pulse starts to decay when crack halts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal=Journal of Applied Physics|pages= 1620–1628| first=V. | last=Frid  | year=2006  | title=Fracture induced electromagnetic radiation|url=http://art-and-science.net/VFRIDFiles/frid_model.pdf|volume=36 | doi=10.1088/0022-3727/36/13/330|bibcode=2003JPhD...36.1620F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observations from experiments showed that emitted EMR signals contain mixed frequency components.

====Test methods to measure EMR====
Most widely tensile test method is used to characterize the mechanical properties of materials. From any complete tensile test record, one can obtain important information about the material's elastic properties, the character and extent of plastic deformation, yield and tensile strengths and toughness. The information which can be obtained from one test justifies the extensive use of tensile test in engineering materials research. Therefore, investigations of EMR emissions are mainly based on the tensile test of the specimens.
From experiments, it can be shown that tensile crack formation excites more intensive EMR than shear cracking, increasing the elasticity, strength and loading rate during uniaxial loading increases amplitude. [[Poisson's ratio|Poissons ratio]] is a key parameter for EMR characterization during triaxial compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics|pages= 5–13| first=V. | last=Frid  | year=2000 | title=Electromagnetic radiation method water-infusion control in rockburst-prone strata|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985199000294|volume =43|issue =1 | doi=10.1016/S0926-9851(99)00029-4|bibcode = 2000JAG....43....5F }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the poissions ratio is lower, it is harder for the material to strain transversally and hence higher is the probability of new fractures. Mechanism of plastic deformation is very important for safe operation of any component under dynamic conditions.

====Uses and applications====
This EMR can be utilized in developing sensors/smart materials. This technique can be implemented in [[powder metallurgy]] technique also.  EMR is one of these emissions which accompany large deformation.  If an element can be identified which gives maximum EMR response with minimum mechanical stimulus then it can be incorporated into main material and thus set new trends in the development of smart material.  The deformation induced EMR can serve as a strong tool for failure detection and prevention.

The''' Tropical Atlantic Variability (TAV)''' is influenced by internal interaction and external effects. TAV can be discussed in different time scales: [[seasonal]] (annual cycle) and interannual.

==Annual Cycle==
Seasonal variability is the dominant time scale of TAV, which is due to the seasonal march of the sun.&lt;ref name=variability&gt;{{cite web 
|title =Tropical Atlantic Variability: Patterns, Mechanisms,and Impacts. | work =Geophysical Monograph | publisher =AGU| year =2004 | url = http://iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/users/xie/Xie_Carton.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seasonal variability is related to the movement of  [[intertropical convergence zone]] (ITCZ),which  is the convergent zone of [[trade winds]] from south and north near the [[equator]]. It has strong vertical [[convection]] resulting to a redundant participation band and weak winds. The mean location of  the ITCZ over the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is 5~10 degrees north of the geographical equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Climate dynamics of the tropics. | work =488 pp., Kluwer Academic, Boston, USA, | year =1991 | url=https://www.springer.com/earth+sciences+and+geography/atmospheric+sciences/book/978-0-7923-1213-0|author=Hastenrath, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The annual cycle in equatorial convection and sea surface temperature| publisher =J. Clim., 5, 1140-1156,| year =1992 | bibcode =1992JCli....5.1140M |author1=Mitchell, T. P. |author2=J. M. Wallace |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1992)005&lt;1140:TACIEC&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; All this asymmetric of ITCZ is the ultimate cause of the annual cycle in equatorial [[sea surface temperature]] (SST) in Atlantic by maintaining southerly cross-equatorial winds that intensify in [[Boreal climate|boreal]] summer/fall and relax in boreal spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The seasonal cycle in a coupled ocean-atmosphere model|publisher =J. Clim., 7, 1208-1217, | year =1994 | url =http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0442(1994)007%3C1208%3ATSCICO%3E2.0.CO%3B2|author=4Giese, B. S., and J. A. Carton }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =On the genesis of the equatorial annual cycle|publisher =J. Clim., 7, 2008-2013, | year = 1994| url =http://iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/users/xie/ann-cycle.pdf|author=Xie, S.-P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; From March to April, during which the temperature of the equator reaches maximum, winds are weakest and the sun shines directly over the equator. So, SST is uniformly warm near the equator, which makes the ITCZ really sensitive to even small disturbance of SST and explains the relaxation of cross-equator winds in spring. From July to September, during which the temperature of the equator reaches its minimum, ITCZ reaches its northernmost location, which explains the intensification of cross-equator winds. It can be seen that the process of cooling takes 3 months while that of warming takes 7 months, which are asymmetric.  This seasonal asymmetry is due to influence of seasonal continental [[monsoon]]. Because of the narrow width of Atlantic, continental monsoon has a much more important influence on its variation compared to the wide [[Pacific Ocean]], whose leading factor is air-sea interaction.

==Interannual  Cycle==
For interannual, there is one mode called [[Atlantic Nino]], of which periodicity varies. During the Atlantic Nino event, eastern area of Atlantic will appear warm SST anomalies accompanying a relaxation of trade winds.&lt;ref&gt;Merle, J. Annual and interannual variability of temperature in the eastern equatorial Atlantic Ocean – hypothesis of an Atlantic El Nino.Oceanol. Acta, 3, 209-220,1980&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism, which is known as Bjerknes Feedback,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Atmospheric teleconnections from the equatorial Pacific|  publisher =Mon. Weather Rev., 97, 163-172| year = 1969| url =http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/097/mwr-097-03-0163.pdf|author=Bjerknes, J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to [[El Nino]]/Southern Oscillation( ENSO).

“On interannual and longer timescales, no single mode seems to dominate. Instead, several mechanisms are responsible for tropical Atlantic variability. On the equator, both observational and modeling studies indicate that there is a Bjerknes-type air-sea coupled mode arising from the interaction of the equatorial zonal SST gradient, ITCZ convection, zonal wind, and [[Thermocline|thermocline depth]].”&lt;ref name="variability" /&gt;

[[Image:Tropical garden monte hg.jpg|thumb|right|A tropical garden on the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]].]]
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Tropical garden.jpg|thumb|right|Palm trees, vines and bamboo in a tropical garden in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]].|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 28 March 2009}}]] --&gt;

A '''tropical garden''' features [[tropical plants]] and requires good [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] or a decent irrigation or [[irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]] system for watering. These [[garden]]s typically need [[fertilizer]] and heavy [[mulch]]ing.

Tropical gardens are no longer exclusive to tropical areas. Many gardeners in colder climates are adopting the tropical [[garden design]], which is possible through careful choice of plants and flowers. Main features include plants with very large leaves, vegetation that builds in height towards the back of the garden, creating a dense garden. Large plants and small trees hang over the garden, leaving sunlight to hit the ground directly.

==Tropical plants==
The following are some examples of tropical plants to be used in tropical gardens or as indoor plants.

===Hoyas===
Hoyas are known as the “Wax Flowers” due to their [[wikt:texture|texture]] and almost unreal appearance. They need relatively warm and [[humid]] conditions, but depending on the specific variety of Hoya, they can endure heavy [[rainfall]] for some months during the wet seasons just as they may also be exposed to long dry periods. They are commonly used indoors. They need indirect [[light]], but the amount or required light depends on the variety. They need small amounts of water and the [[soil]] is to be kept slightly dry since a very wet soil can end up killing this kind of plant. They can be grown in [[Plant pot|pot]]s that are not too big or in hanging baskets. They grow better if kept at a minimum temperature of 15 degree Celsius (59 Fahrenheit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mollystropicalplants.com/care-sheets/hoya-care| title=Hoya Care|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banana plants===
Contrary to common belief, growing banana trees is not that difficult and allow people to enjoy their own bananas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caladiumbulbcompany.net/banana-tree/ |title=Cheap banana trees |date= |accessdate=2010-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608094324/http://caladiumbulbcompany.net/banana-tree/ |archivedate=June 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also these plants can be used as [[windbreak]]s. They need fertile soils, large [[mulch]] and organic matter, large amounts of [[nitrogen]] and [[potassium]], warm temperature, high humidity, large amounts of water, and [[wikt:shelter|shelter]] from other banana plants. Banana plants are not to be exposed to strong [[wind]]s and extreme weather conditions (too hot or too cold weather) with an ideal temperature being 26-30 degree Celsius (78-86 Fahrenheit). They stop growing below 14 degree Celsius (57 Fahrenheit). Banana [[rhizomes]] are planted upright and their roots have to be well covered with soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tropicalpermaculture.com/growing-bananas.html| title=Growing bananas|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bird of paradise===
Among the many species of birds of paradise is the Strelitzia reginae, an indigenous plant to [[South Africa]] and [[South America]]. As a tropical plant, it grows in warm, humid climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landscaping.about.com/od/tropicalplants/a/bird_paradise.htm| title=Jungle-Type Bird of Paradise Flowers|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exotic, colorful plant, with evergreen [[leaves]] resembles a bird's beak. It is an outdoor plant provided the weather is not too cold. Otherwise, it is better to keep it in a pot indoors. It needs rich soil as well as [[sun]] or partial shade. Another requirement for this plant is a good [[drainage]].

===Ferns===
Ferns are commonly used to give gardens a great foliage. Most ferns are easy to take care of. They basically cannot be exposed to direct sunlight for long periods of time. Moreover, their soil should always be moist. One way to keep ferns moist is by misting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutferns.com/fern_care.shtml| title=Fern Care|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papaya tree===
Papaya trees should be planted where they can be kept warm and free from wind and [[Freezing|freeze]]. They need enough water to support their leaves, but it should not be exceed as to a [[root]] rod. They also need a well-drained soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tropicamango.com/papaya.html| title=How Not to Kill Your Papaya Tree|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orchids===
Night temperatures between 12- 18 degree Celsius (55-65 Fahrenheit), and day temperatures between 23 -26 degree Celsius ( 75-80 Fahrenheit) are fine temperatures for orchids. Orchids need sufficient amounts of light as well as humidity. However, there are many varieties of orchids and each of them features specific care needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tropgard.com/plant-profiles/242-orchids-general-care-| title=Orchids – General Care|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==
A tropical garden is one of the most difficult gardens to build, or maintain, it becomes more difficult the more your local climate differs from the natural [[habitat]] of your plants. Key to a healthy tropical garden are lots of light and lots of water. The large leaves that feature in tropical plants require the soil to be humid at all times, so [[irrigation]] might be a must-have for some gardens. Over-watering can kill your plants as well, as it will cause the roots to rot.

A tropical plant that is not cold-hardy should be brought indoors during the winter and returned to the garden for the summer.

==Non-tropical climates==

'''Uno-X''' is a chain of unmanned [[fuel station]]s throughout [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]]. It is operated as the low-cost section of [[YX Energi]]. The chain was originally created as a low cost chain in Denmark in the late 1950s.  The rights to use the name in Sweden were sold to Britain's [[Burmah Oil]].  In 1991 [[Norsk Hydro]] acquired the 330 outlets of the Danish operation and five years later it bought the Swedish Uno-X chain from Burmah.

After Norsk Hydro merged its operations in Denmark and Norway with [[Texaco]], the chain was repositioned on wholly unmanned sites under a new yellow, black and red logo, and now has around 110 stations in Norway and 200 stations in Denmark.  The Danish chain includes the architecturally well known [[Skovshoved Petrol Station]] designed in 1936 by [[Arne Jacobsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.aok.dk/byen-rundt/arne-jacobsens-tankstation|title=Arne Jacobsens Tankstation|publisher=AOK |accessdate=2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Norsk Hydro's acquisition by [[Statoil]], the 250 stations in Sweden were sold in December 2009 to [[St1]] and the Norwegian and Danish operations to the retail group [[Reitangruppen]].

Uno-X Hydrogen plans to build 20 [[hydrogen station]]s before 2020, each capable of dispensing 200&amp;nbsp;kg of hydrogen per day, and 100&amp;nbsp;kg in 3 hours.&lt;ref name=erlien2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tu.no/artikler/dersom-fem-hydrogenbiler-ankommer-en-fyllestasjon-samtidig-er-det-bare-drivstoff-nok-til-fire-av-dem/346738|title=Dersom fem hydrogenbiler ankommer en fyllestasjon samtidig, er det bare drivstoff nok til fire av dem|author=Per Erlien Dalløkken|work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]]|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voltages vary widely between applications. 

In general, vehicle electrification refers to efforts to design mild to full hybrid vehicle to full electric vehicles as well as converting some of the non-electrical vehicle systems like hydraulic suspension-systems to smart electro-magnetic suspensions, or All-Wheel-Drive (AWD) to eAWD where AWD is automatically engaged only under certain conditions (like certain low vehicle speed range) to leave more juice for full electric vehicle range as opposed to AWD all the time which sips more juices from battery.

==Land vehicles==
This section will cover common voltages for different vehicle applications.

===6 volt===
Automobiles engineered prior to the 1940s had 6-volt systems in them.  However, 6-volts is a common voltage for single 3-cell [[Deep-cycle battery|deep-cycle]] [[Lead-acid battery|lead-acid]] batteries for applications such as [[golf cart]]s, though they have 24 volts or 36 volts for their electric motors.

===12 volt===
12 volt systems are by far the most common voltage system for vehicles in general.  Primarily the voltage was devised to overcome limitations of old 6-volt systems as, by the 1950s starting motors needed to become more powerful, but needed more power with less current as well as a way to cut down on [[wire gauge]] as more equipment came along and put a greater load on the system.  Over time, 12 volt systems evolved to have mainstream niche fields like [[car audio]] which has spanned across

===24 volt===
24 volt systems are common in military and commercial truck applications.  It is also a secondary voltage system for [[Switch-mode power supply|switch-mode power supplies]] with parallel-to-series relays for facilitating engine starting on [[diesel engine]]s as they require more compression than regular gas.

===42 volt===
