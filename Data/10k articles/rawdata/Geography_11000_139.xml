The '''Aldan River''' ({{lang-ru|Алдан}}) is the second-longest [[tributary]] of the [[Lena River]] in the [[Sakha Republic]] in eastern [[Siberia]].  The river is {{convert|2273|km|mi}} long, of which around {{convert|1600|km|mi}} is navigable.  It was part of the [[Siberian River Routes|River Route]] to [[Okhotsk]]. In 1639 [[Ivan Moskvitin]] ascended the Aldan and [[Maya River]]s and crossed to the [[Ulya River]] to reach the [[Sea of Okhotsk]].

It rises in the [[Stanovoy Mountains]] southwest of [[Neryungri]], then northeast past [[Aldan, Russia|Aldan]] and through [[Tommot]], [[Ust-Maya]], [[Eldikan]] and [[Khandyga]] before turning northwest and joining the Lena near [[Batamay]].

The river's main tributaries are the [[Amga River]], [[Uchur River]] and Maya River.  Its [[Drainage basin|basin]] is known for gold and for [[Cambrian]] [[fossil]]s.

'''Anania Shirakatsi''' (''Anania Širakac'i'', {{lang-hy|Անանիա Շիրակացի}}; 610&amp;ndash;685 AD), also known as '''Ananias of Shirak''' or '''Širak''') was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]], [[geographer]] and [[alchemist]]. His most famous works are ''[[Ashkharatsuyts]]'' (''Geography'') and ''Cosmography and the Calendar''. [[Robert H. Hewsen]] describes him as "Armenia's First Scientist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewsen|first=Robert H.|authorlink=Robert H. Hewsen|title=Armenia: A Historical Atlas|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|date=2001|isbn=0-226-33228-4}} The [[Dedication (publishing)|dedication page]] states:&lt;br /&gt;"Dedicated to &lt;br /&gt;Ananias of Shirak&lt;br /&gt;Armenia's First Scientist"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Scholars do not agree on where Anania was born. Some historians believe that he was born in [[Shirakavan (ancient city)|Shirakavan]]; others, that the village of Anania in [[Shirak Province|Shirak]] or the city of [[Ani]] was his birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, Tim. "A Reassessment of the Life and Mathematical Problems of Anani Širakac'i." ''[[Revue des Études Arméniennes]]'', 33 (2011), pp. 131-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia]]. vol. i. Yerevan: [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], 1974, pp. 362-364.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other notable figures, Anania left behind an autobiography. It is known that he was the son of John (Hovhannes) of Shirak and possibly a member of the noble [[Kamsarakan]] or Arsharuni princes of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hewsen|first1=Robert H.|authorlink1=Robert H.

Upon the recommendation of several of his friends who were returning from [[Constantinople]], he decided to find a suitable teacher in [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. There he met and fell under the tutelage of a renowned [[Greeks|Greek]] scholar who spoke Armenian, Tychikos, and spent eight years learning mathematics there.&lt;ref&gt;Approximately one third of Anania's autobiography is devoted to Tychikos' life. A brief biography is given by Hewsen in "Seventh-Century Armenia", p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Anania profited greatly from his mentor's teachings, as evidenced from the writings in his autobiography, "[I] acquired a perfect knowledge of mathematics. In addition, he also learned a few elements of other sciences."&lt;ref&gt;Hachikyan et al. ''Heritage of Armenian Literature'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; He left Byzantium and returned to his homeland in 651, determined to spread his knowledge among his fellow Armenians, opening a school that taught the [[quadrivium]] and authoring textbooks to educate his students.&lt;ref name="SAE" /&gt;

==Works==

===Armenian calendar===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Anania-Shirakatsi-coin.gif|thumb|The Anania Shirakatsi commemorative coin.]] --&gt;
The education center Anania established could not have come at a better time and was a welcoming sight during an era when the study of mathematics was waning. After teaching for only several years, he had gained a famous reputation all throughout Armenia and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Hewsen. "Seventh-Century Armenia", p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of one of his most significant accomplishments came in 667 when the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] invited him to [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] and asked him to modify the [[Armenian calendar]] from a movable to fixed system.&lt;ref name="SAE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hewsen pp. 35-36"&gt;Hewsen. "Seventh-Century Armenia", pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;
Taking into account the incompatibilities of the seven-day week, the lunar month, and the solar year, he worked for two years and devised a system that was based on cycle of 532 years.&lt;ref name="Hewsen pp. 35-36" /&gt; Anania's solution, though, was never adopted by the Church.

===''Ashkharhatsuyts''===
Among all his works, Anania is best known for writing the ''[[Ashkharatsuyts (Anania Shirakatsi)|Ashkharhatsuyts]]'' (''Geography''). Up until recently, it was attributed to the Armenian historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]] but it is now believed by a number of experts such as [[Robert Hewsen]] and [[Suren Yeremyan|Suren T. Yeremyan]] to have been authored by Anania himself.&lt;ref&gt;This, however, does not mean the debate on its authorship is over. For a history on the scholarly debate on the authorship of the ''Ashkharhatsuyts'', see the "Preface" and "Introduction" in Robert Hewsen's ''The Geography of Ananias of Širak: Ašxarhacoyc, the Long and the Short Recensions''. Wiesbaden: Dr. Ludwig Reichert, 1992, {{ISBN|3-88226-485-3}} and Babken Harutyunyan's article, "[http://www.matenadaran.am/en/heritage/geography/index.html#3 Historical Geography]."&lt;/ref&gt; Babken Harutyunyan, head of Chair of the History of Armenia at [[Yerevan State University]], however disputes this and maintains that Movses Khorenatsi was the true author on the basis "that all the manuscripts of the 'Ashxarhatsoyts' preserving the author's name, without exception, point at the Patmahayr [father of history] Movses Xorenatsi as an author of the work."&lt;ref&gt;Haroutunian, Babken. "[http://www.matenadaran.am/en/heritage/geography/index.html#3 Historical Geography]." Matenadaran. Accessed March 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ashkharhatsuyts''  is a historical atlas that gives detailed information on the fifteen provinces of Armenia. Anania gives general information on "the earth, its surface, climatic belts, seas" and also includes information on Armenia's neighbors.&lt;ref name="Matenadaran"&gt;[http://www.matenadaran.am/en/heritage/geography.html The Heritage: Geography]. [[Matenadaran]]. Accessed March 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest extant manuscript in the field of Armenian geography preserved at the [[Matenadaran]] in [[Yerevan]] is Anania's ''Ashkharhatsuyts''.&lt;ref name="Matenadaran"/&gt;

===Astronomy===
Anania also authored ''Cosmography and the Calendar'', a 48 chapter work that discusses [[astronomy]], [[meteorology]], and [[physical geography]].&lt;ref&gt;Hewsen. "Seventh-Century Armenia", pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; He described the world as "being like an egg with a spherical yolk (the globe) surrounded by a layer of white (the atmosphere) and covered with a hard shell (the sky)."&lt;ref name="Hewsen36"&gt;Hewsen. "Seventh-Century Armenia", p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed "that the Milky Way is a mass of dense but faintly luminous stars and agreed with earlier philosophers that the moon was a dark body by nature whose only light was that which it reflected from the sun."&lt;ref name="Hewsen36"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Anania is considered the founder of the study of the [[natural sciences]] in Armenia.&lt;ref name="SAE" /&gt; For centuries, his works were used at schools in Armenia as textbooks. The Anania Shirakatsi Medal is an Armenian State Award for scientists in the [[economics]] and natural sciences, [[engineers]] and [[inventors]]. In 2005, the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia issued an Anania Shirakatsi [[commemorative coin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12700">The '''Central Asian Orogenic Belt''' ('''CAOB''', also known as '''Altaids''') is one of the largest accretionary [[orogen]]s on Earth and evolved over some 800 million years from the latest [[Mesoproterozoic]] to the early [[Triassic]]. It contains a record of geodynamic processes during one of the most important episodes of [[continent]]al growth in [[Phanerozoic]] time.

==Location==
The CAOB stretches from the [[Ural Mountains]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], occupying an area of about 5.3 million square kilometers, about 11% of the [[Asia]]n surface area. It is bounded on the north by the [[Siberia]]n [[craton]] and on the south by the [[North China craton]] and the Tarim craton, which provides substrate for the [[Tarim Basin]]. The CAOB encompasses parts of six nations: [[China]], [[Mongolia]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. It includes mountain ranges north of Tibet, including the [[Tian Shan]] (Chinese for "heavenly mountains") where a good example of Paleozoic arc accretion is exposed. The [[Altai Mountains]] of Russia, Kazakhstan, northwest China and western Mongolia also expose a complex accretionary terrane. CAOB rocks are also well exposed in Kazakhstan, the [[South Gobi Range]] of southern Mongolia, the Beishan and Inner Mongolia of northern China, the [[Sayan Mountains]] of southern Siberia just north of Mongolia, the ranges of [[Buryatia]] in southern Siberia south of [[Lake Baikal]], and in the Far East of China and Russia.

==Geologic evolution==
{{see also|Kalba-Narym batholith}}
There has been much discussion about the [[tectonic]] evolution of the CAOB over the last two decades, and these interpretations fall into two general groups.

[[File:russianDZ.jpg|thumb|U-Pb [[Detrital zircon geochronology|ages of detrital zircons]] from sediments of five Russian rivers, after {{Harvnb|Safonova|Maruyama|Hirata|Kon|2010}}. Note 4 age peaks, from most to least important: 1) Paleozoic (250-500 millions of years old (Ma)); 2) Paleoproterozoic (~1.8 billion years old (Ga)); 3) Archean (~2,7 Ga); and 4) Neoproterozoic (530-1000 Ma). Many Paleoproterozoic ages come from surrounding cratons, Paleozoic ages mostly come from CAOB and Urals]]

One group of researchers suggests that the belt grew, in the Neoproterozoic and Palaeozoic, from the margin of the Siberian craton to the south through accretion of [[island arc]]s and Precambrian continental blocks until the evolution was terminated through collision with the North China and Tarim cratons in the latest Paleozoic to early Mesozoic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Windley|Alexeiev|Xiao|Kröner|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Kröner|Windley|Badarch|Tomurtogoo|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Xiao|Huang|Han|Sun|2010|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original paleogeographic position of the continental blocks is debated, but some studies suggest a [[Gondwana]] affinity of many allochthonous terranes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dobretsov|Buslov|Vernikovsky|2003}}; {{Harvnb|Dobretsov|Buslov|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others infer a [[Siberia]]n or [[Tarim River|Tarim]] origin for the same blocks .&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kuzmichev|Bibikova|Zhuravlev|2001}}; {{Harvnb|Rojas-Agramonte|Kröner|Demoux|Xia|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second group of researchers regards the CAOB as mainly composed of a huge Paleozoic subduction-accretion complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Şengör|Natal'in|Burtman|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; which accumulated against a single, long magmatic arc.

The CAOB, like other major accretionary orogens, consists of:
# accretionary wedges;
# island arc, forearc and back-arc systems, largely dismembered [[ophiolite]]s, oceanic plateaux;
# blocks of older continental crust, ranging in age from Archaean to Neoproterozoic;
# synorogenic [[granitic|granite]] and [[metamorphic rocks]] including exhumed [[Ultra-high-pressure metamorphism|HP-UHP metamorphic rock]]s,
# clastic sedimentary basins;
# [[Permian]] post-collisional granitoids and intraplate igneous suites. Large-scale late Paleozoic shear zones follow the orogenic grain.

There are many controversies about CAOB tectono-magmatic evolution. One is the problem of juvenile versus recycled crust in the formation of CAOB igneous rocks. On one hand, the CAOB is considered to be the most important site of juvenile crust formation since the Neoproterozoic, because during its amalgamation, which involved terrains of different geodynamic origin overlain by magmatic units, massive amounts of granitic magmas were generated with juvenile [[Isotopes of neodymium|Nd isotopic signatures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jahn|Capdevila|Liu|Vernon|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recently obtained [[Detrital zircon geochronology|detrital]] and xenocrystic [[Zircon#Radiometric dating|zircon ages]] confirmed an important role for older crust in the orogen's evolution.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{Harvnb|Rino|Kon|Sato|Maruyama|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Safonova|Maruyama|Hirata|Kon|2010}}; {{Harvnb|Rojas-Agramonte|Kröner|Demoux|Xia|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modest [[Neoproterozoic]] and huge early-middle [[Paleozoic]] zircon age spectra match CAOB crustal growth very well but older peaks of ~1.8 Ga and ~2.7 Ga suggest the involvement of older crust.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7940">'''China Concepts Stock''' is a set of stock of companies whose assets or earnings have significant activities in [[mainland China]]. The [[People's Republic of China]] is undergoing major [[Chinese financial system|financial transformation]], and many leading mainland-based companies have chosen to list themselves overseas to gain access to foreign investor capital. Currently, there are China Concepts Stocks listed on several major stock exchanges around the globe, including the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] (HKEx), [[Singapore Exchange]] (SGX), [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), [[NASDAQ]], [[NYSE MKT]] (formerly known as the American Stock Exchange), [[London Stock Exchange]] (LSE), [[Euronext]], and the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] (TSE).

During the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], many publicly traded Chinese companies were tainted by fraud scandals. In Hong Kong, there have been several [[P chips frauds]]. Singapore has had to cope with [[S chips scandals]]. And the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] is currently investigating [[China stock frauds]].

'''Common Operational Datasets''' or '''CODs''', are authoritative reference datasets needed to support operations and decision-making for all actors in a humanitarian response. CODs are 'best available' datasets that ensure consistency and simplify the discovery and exchange of key data. The data is typically geo-spatially linked using a [[coordinate system]] (especially administrative boundaries) and have unique geographic identification codes ([[Place code|P-codes]]).

== Governance and Purpose of CODs ==

=== Purpose ===
Common operation datasets are commonly used and referenced by all operations, they provide consistency among all actors working on humanitarian preparedness and response and enable a common operational picture (COP) of the crisis. P-codes facilitate the exchange and harmonization of data and information, they provide a geographic framework for data collection, analysis, and visualization ('''see P-code''') and allow for a better interoperability and exchange between different actors. Therefore, common cperation cdatasets (CODs) reduce duplication of work on baseline data by partnering organizations and facilitate informed decision making both pre- and post-crisis.

=== The Information Management Network ===
The Information Management Network (IM Network) is an important component of the common operational datatset (COD) process.  The IM Network can exist at country, regional and global levels and is composed of the humanitarian information management actors active in the country, region or at the global level. Potential IM Network actors include governments, United NAtions agencies and programmes, humanitarian cluster information management staff, international and national NGOs.

=== Outputs ===

== Common Operational Datasets ==

=== Core Common Operational Datasets ===
Core CODs are required in all disaster-prone countries as a preparedness measure, including administrative boundaries (COD-AB), sex and age-disaggregated population data (COD-PS), and humanitarian profile (caseload or COD-HP). They are critical for information and data products and to underpin effective coordination. Core CODs enable effective risk analysis, needs assessment, decision-making, and reporting on all aspects of the response.

==== Administrative Boundaries (COD-AB) ====

Administrative Boundary CODs are baseline geographical datasets that are used by humanitarian agencies during preparedness and response activities. They are preferably sourced from official government boundaries but when these are unavailable the information management network must develop and agree to a process to develop or adopt an alternate dataset. Administrative boundaries provide an essential data standard and are used directly and indirectly in almost every information product.

The administrative boundary dataset is key in preparedness and undergoes a review process to keep the data up to date.

==== Population Statistics (COD-PS) ====

Population Statistics CODs are the baseline population figures of a country pre-crisis situation. They are preferably developed by a government during a census but can also be derived from estimated figures. When neither of these options are available the information management network must develop and agree to a process to develop a dataset that can be used by humanitarian agencies during preparedness and response activities.

Population statistics are required to inform programming in humanitarian response. Specifically, they are used to estimate the potential number of affected people or as a reference/resource in the development of needs assessments and in analysis.

==== Humanitarian Profile (COD-HP) ====

Humanitarian profile (affected people, people in need)

=== Country-specific CODs ===
Country-specific Common Operational Datasets are a subset of the CODs that are specific to each country’s risk profile. They are datasets for which it is essential that the humanitarian community uses the same version of the data as a reference. The purpose of a country-specific COD is to provide a common reference for the humanitarian community to create a common operational picture (spatial datasets); to allow for further understanding of the situation (statistical data, tabular data etc); or to aid with assessments. Ideally, Country-specific CODs are identified and agreed to as a preparedness activity but the list should be reviewed and revised (if required) at the onset of a crisis based on the situation at that time and the humanitarian needs).

== Process ==
The life cycle of a Common Operational Dataset (COD) is planning, collecting, processing, endorsing, communicating, maintaining.

Common Operational Datasets (CODs) are identified by the information management network (IM network) in a country or regionally. If there is no IM network in place all efforts are made at higher levels (e.g. global) to identify  desired datasets. The IM network is responsible for collecting and maintaining the CODs and revising the datasets as required. CODs are made available online, if possible, prior to an emergency or shortly after disaster strikes.

=== Planning ===
IM Network partners work together to develop a plan for all CODs including prioritization of datasets. The goal of the planning phase is to have an agreed upon list of commonly used datasets by partners. Once clear goals and objectives are identified, work can begin on the identification of sources and datasets.

=== Collecting ===
Collecting CODs is the process of locally acquiring datasets, and includes collection of metadata. The second part of the collection process is the evaluation phase that includes an examination of potential sources. The evaluation involves a quick in-country quality assurance check to ensure (potential) compliance with the minimum standard of data characteristics (spatial and attribute) and metadata. The process identifies potential problems or opportunities with datasets that should be considered when deciding what dataset should become the COD.

=== Processing ===
In the process phase the quality of the dataset is improved to the best standard possible. The processing phase cleans and standardizes the datasets and can be the most resource and time intensive stage of the COD cycle if the quality of the data is low.

=== Endorsement ===
The endorsement phase has 2 steps: validation and endorsement (in the country and at the global level).

'''The validation''' phase is a technical review on the Candidate COD and is done to ensure that the corrections made in the processing phase have created the best available COD.

'''The endorsement''' phase of CODs is the defining moment of the COD cycle as it is at this stage that operational partners agree that the candidate COD is going to be the referential dataset for humanitarian preparedness and response activities.

=== Communication ===
The Communication phase includes agreed upon means of sharing the dataset and also transparency about changes of the data in the process, available metadata and advocation for the use of common operational datatsets.

=== Maintenance ===
Maintenance is an important step in the COD cycle as it ensures that the datasets are still relevant and accurate for humanitarian use. This is done at least once a year or in the timespan agreed upon.

== P-codes ==
Place Codes (P-Codes) are found in Administrative Boundary CODs. They are unique geographic (geo) identification codes, represented by combinations of letters and/or numbers to identify a specific location or feature on a map or within a database. For a specific place, point, or positional locations, the geo-codes have come into common usages as P-codes (abbreviated for Place-code). These terms can be essentially interchanged as long as one recognizes the focus on “position or place” for P-codes. They are also used to provide unique reference codes to refer to settlements or administrative boundaries in other datasets.

== Notes ==
Whilst some data-sets remain relatively constant (e.g. geographical features and administrative boundaries) others change (assessed disaster impacts and needs) and require to be regularly updated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inter-Agency Standing Committee|date=2010|title=IASC Guidelines Common Operational Datasets (CODs) in Disaster Preparedness and Response|url=http://fscluster.org/sites/default/files/documents/IASC_Guidelines_on_Common_Operational_Datasets_in_Disaster_Preparedness_and_Response_1_Nov._2010%5B1%5D.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CODs are intended to be used universally to improve coordination in humanitarian action; to build a [[common operational picture]] enabling more consistent activity and reduce duplication of data collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/commonoperationaldataset/home|title=COD - Technical Support Package (DRAFT)|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main source of curated CODs is the Humanitarian Data Exchange,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.humdata.org/|title=Welcome - Humanitarian Data Exchange|website=data.humdata.org|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; though CODs may also be found on various governmental and independent websites.

'''Cultural regions of Latvia''' are several areas within [[Latvia]] formally recognised as distinct from the rest of the country. While some of these regions are seen purely as culturally distinct, others have historically been parts of different countries and have been used to divide the country for administrative and other purposes. The [[Constitution of Latvia]] recognises four distinct regions: '''Kurzeme''', '''Zemgale''', '''Latgale''' and '''Vidzeme'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balticdata.info/latvia/politics/latvia_politics_legislative_power_parliament_political_scene_elections_summary.htm |title=Elections |publisher=[[Latvian Institute of International Affairs]] (LIIA) |author=Valts Kalnins |date=October 2001 |accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regions ==
*[[Courland]] ({{lang-lv|Kurzeme}}, [[Livonian language|Livonian]]: ''Kurāmō''), the westernmost part of Latvia, consisting of the cities of [[Liepāja]] and [[Ventspils]] and the municipalities of [[Aizpute municipality|Aizpute]], [[Alsunga municipality|Alsunga]], [[Brocēni municipality|Brocēni]], [[Dundaga municipality|Dundaga]], [[Durbe municipality|Durbe]], [[Grobiņa municipality|Grobiņa]], [[Kandava municipality|Kandava]], [[Kuldīga municipality|Kuldīga]], [[Nīca municipality|Nīca]], [[Pāvilosta municipality|Pāvilosta]], [[Priekule municipality|Priekule]], [[Roja municipality|Roja]], [[Rucava municipality|Rucava]], [[Saldus municipality|Saldus]], [[Skrunda municipality|Skrunda]], [[Talsi municipality|Talsi]], [[Vaiņode municipality|Vaiņode]] and [[Ventspils municipality|Ventspils]].
*[[Semigallia]] ({{lang-lv|Zemgale}}) is the central part of Latvia. Zemgale is bounded by Kurzeme in the west, the [[Gulf of Riga]], the [[Daugava River|Daugava]] river and Vidzeme in the north, Selonia in the east and the [[Lithuania]]n border in the south. It consists of the city of [[Jelgava]] and the municipalities of [[Auce municipality|Auce]], [[Baldone municipality|Baldone]], [[Bauska municipality|Bauska]], [[Dobele municipality|Dobele]], [[Engure municipality|Engure]], [[Iecava municipality|Iecava]], [[Jaunpils municipality|Jaunpils]], [[Jelgava municipality|Jelgava]], [[Ozolnieki municipality|Ozolnieki]], [[Rundāle municipality|Rundāle]], [[Tērvete municipality|Tērvete]], [[Tukums municipality|Tukums]] and [[Vecumnieki municipality|Vecumnieki]]. Traditional Semigallia also includes the northern part of [[Šiauliai County]] in Lithuania.
**[[Selonia]] ({{lang-lv|Sēlija, Augšzeme}}) is often considered a part of Semigallia. Selonia comprises the eastern part of the 1939 province of Semigallia, roughly corresponding to parts of the former [[Aizkraukle District|Aizkraukle]], [[Daugavpils District|Daugavpils]] and [[Jēkabpils District|Jēkabpils]] districts south of Daugava river. Traditional Selonia also includes a portion of north east Lithuania. Named after the [[Selonians]].
* [[Vidzeme]] ([[Livonian language|Livonian]]: ''Vidūmō''), meaning "Middle land", is also known as [[Livland]], though it comprises only a small part of traditional Livland. Present Vidzeme is the Latvian part of [[Swedish Livonia]] and City of Riga. It roughly corresponds to the former [[Alūksne District|Alūksne]], [[Cēsis District|Cēsis]], [[Gulbene District|Gulbene]], [[Limbazi District|Limbaži]], [[Madona District|Madona]], [[Valka District|Valka]], [[Valmiera District|Valmiera]] districts and parts of [[Aizkraukle District|Aizkraukle]], [[Ogre District|Ogre]] and [[Riga District|Riga]] districts north of Daugava river.
* [[Latgallia]] ({{lang-lv|Latgale}}, [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]]: ''Latgola''), the part of Livonia still in hands of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] after the [[Treaty of Altmark]] in 1629, so called [[Inflanty Voivodeship]]. It roughly corresponds to [[Balvi District|Balvi]], [[Kraslava District|Krāslava]], [[Ludza District|Ludza]], [[Preili District|Preiļi]], [[Rezekne District|Rēzekne]] districts and parts of [[Daugavpils District|Daugavpils]] and [[Jēkabpils District|Jēkabpils]] districts north of Daugava river.

In some cases, Kurzeme and Zemgale are combined into one region. This reflects the political division of Latvia between 1629 and 1917, when Kurzeme and Zemgale were together, first as the [[Duchy of Courland]], then as the [[Courland Governorate]] in the [[Russian Empire]] while Vidzeme and Latgale were politically separate, both from Courland and one from another.

From this perspective, there are three regions: Kurzeme (including Zemgale and Sēlija), Vidzeme and Latgale. Such division is no longer commonly used but it can be seen in the [[coat of arms of Latvia]] and the ''Monument of Freedom'' in Riga both of which contain three stars: for Kurzeme, Vidzeme and Latgale, which were united into [[Latvia]] in 1918.

'''Devínska Kobyla''' ({{IPA-sk|ˈɟɛʋiːnska ˈkɔbila}}; {{lang-de|Thebener Kogel}}) is the highest peak in the [[Devín Carpathians]], part of the [[Little Carpathians]] mountain range, and the highest point of [[Bratislava]], the capital of [[Slovakia]]. It is located between the boroughs of [[Devínska Nová Ves]], [[Devín]] and [[Dúbravka, Bratislava|Dúbravka]], close to the border with [[Austria]]. Its peak elevation is 514&amp;nbsp;m (1686.3&amp;nbsp;ft) [[above mean sea level|AMSL]] and its treeless summit contains an abandoned military missile base ({{lang-sk|Rádiotechnická hláska protivzdušnej obrany štátu}}) that is officially inaccessible to the public.

Part of southern slopes of the massif has been a national natural reserve since 1965, featuring unique [[xerothermic]] forest-steppe [[flora]] and [[fauna]] with a total protected area of 101 [[hectare]]s.&lt;ref name=SlovakiaTravel&gt;{{cite web|title=Devínska Kobyla Mt.

Hiking trails do not lead to the summit but instead to an accessible point with partial view underneath.

== Description ==
Devínska Kobyla and its surroundings are one of the four divisions of [[Devín Carpathians]], part of [[Little Carpathians]], itself part of the [[Carpathian mountains]].

==Flora and fauna==
The small area contains 234 species of identified [[mushrooms]], 110 species of identified [[lichens]], 100 species of identified [[moss]], and 1,110 species of identified higher or [[vascular plants]].&lt;ref name="SlovakiaTravel" /&gt; The southern and south-western slopes of the mountain at the western edge of [[Bratislava]] provide ideal living conditions for [[xerothermic]] forest-steppe [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. The woods on the south-western slopes are the remains of the original [[oak]] forest.

== Hiking ==
[[Image:Kobyla-pano.jpg|thumb|left|Panorama of Danube taken from Devinska Kobyla]]

There is a four-kilometer instructive path that leads through Devínska Kobyla, with one significant area called [[Sandberg (Slovakia)|Sandberg]]. This is one of the most important palaeontological localities in [[Slovakia]]. The yellow faces of the old sandpit has remnants of rocks of the tertiary sea with horizontally deposited layers, and there are still [[fossils]] of sea [[fauna]] to be found there. The age of these rocks is estimated to be between 14 and 16 million years old.

[[Image:DiomedeIslands.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Diomede Islands, from a U.S. government nautical chart.  The purple vertical line is the international boundary.]]
The '''Diomede Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|.|ə|ˈ|m|iː|d|iː}}; {{lang-ru|острова́ Диоми́да}}, ''ostrová Diomída''), also known in [[Russia]] as '''Gvozdev Islands''' ({{lang-ru|острова́ Гво́здева}}, ''ostrová Gvozdjeva''), consist of two rocky, [[mesa]]-like islands:

* The [[Russia]]n island of ''[[Big Diomede]]'' (part of [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]]), also known as ''Imaqliq'', ''Inaliq'',  ''Nunarbuk'' or ''Ratmanov Island''
* The [[United States|U.S.]] island of ''[[Little Diomede]]'' (part of [[Alaska]]) or ''Ignaluk'', also known as Krusenstern Island{{efn|Krusenstern Island may also refer to other places; see [[Krusenstern Island (disambiguation)]]}}

The Diomede Islands are located in the middle of the [[Bering Strait]] between mainland [[Alaska]] and [[Siberia]], which borders with the [[Chukchi Sea]] to the north and the [[Bering Sea]] to the south. {{convert|9.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southeast is [[Fairway Rock]], which is generally not considered part of the Diomede Islands. Because they are separated by the [[International Date Line]], Big Diomede is almost a day ahead of Little Diomede, but not completely; due to locally defined time zones, Big Diomede is only 21 hours ahead of Little Diomede (20 in summer; not 23 or 24&amp;nbsp;hours ahead—which is a common misconception).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://epaper.dawn.com/DetailImage.php?StoryImage=18_11_2017_375_002|title=Two of the world`s largest countries, Russia and the United States, at their closest points are separated by 2.4 miles, but are 21 hours apart! Find out how ... {{!}} ePaper {{!}} DAWN.COM|website=epaper.dawn.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this the islands are sometimes called Tomorrow Island (Big Diomede) and Yesterday Isle (Little Diomede).

==Etymology==
The islands are named for [[Saint Diomedes]], whose name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words Διος (''Dios''), meaning "of Zeus", and μηδομαι (''medomai''), meaning "to think, to plan".

==Location==
The islands are separated by an international border, which is also part of the [[International Date Line]], about {{convert|2|km|mi||abbr=on}} from each island, at 168°58'37"W. At their closest points, the two islands are about {{convert|3.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart. The small habitation on Little Diomede Island is centered on the [[west]] side of the island at the [[Diomede, Alaska|village of Diomede]].

The Big Diomede Island is the [[Extreme points of Russia|easternmost point of Russia]].

The Diomede Islands are often mentioned as likely intermediate stops for the hypothetical [[bridge]] or [[tunnel]] ([[Bering Strait crossing]]) spanning the [[Bering Strait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15387714|work=BBC News|title=Could a Russia–US rail tunnel be built?|date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During winter, an ice bridge usually spans the distance between these two islands; therefore during such times it is theoretically possible (although not legal, since travel between the two islands is forbidden) to walk between the United States and Russia.

==History==
The first European to reach the Bering Strait was the Russian explorer [[Semyon Dezhnev]] in 1648. He reported two islands whose natives had bone lip ornaments, but it is not certain that these were the Diomedes. Danish navigator [[Vitus Bering]] re-discovered the Diomede Islands while leading a Russian expedition on 16 August (O.S., 26&amp;nbsp;August N.S.) 1728, the day when the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] celebrates the memory of the martyr [[St. Diomede]] (hence, the name of the islands). In 1732, a Russian [[Geodesy|geodesist]], [[Mikhail Gvozdev]], determined longitude and latitude for the two islands.&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of the New Discoveries in the Eastern Ocean|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/126|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the 1867 treaty between the United States and Russia which finalized the [[Alaska purchase]] uses the islands to designate the boundary between the two nations: The border separates "equidistantly Krusenstern Island, or Ignaluk, from Ratmanov Island, or Nunarbuk, and heads northward infinitely until it disappears completely in the Arctic Ocean."

During the [[Cold War]], that gap constituted the border between the US and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and became known as the "[[Bering Strait#The "Ice Curtain" border|Ice Curtain]]". In 1987, however, [[Lynne Cox]] swam from one island to the other, and was congratulated by both [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] for her feat.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Martin. January 31, 1988. "The transcendent power of the solo athlete." ''[[Orange County Register]],'' p.J1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 1995, British television actor and documentary presenter [[Michael Palin]] started his counterclockwise circumnavigation of the [[Pacific Rim]], encompassing 18 different countries, on Little Diomede Island, as part of the BBC series ''[[Full Circle with Michael Palin|Full Circle]]''. He intended to set foot on it again at the end of his eight-month trek, but was unable to do so because of rough seas.

Big Diomede Island was traditionally the easternmost landmass before the [[International Date Line]], and the first landmass to ring in a new year, if using local [[solar time]]. When using official time, however, a large area in eastern Russia and [[New Zealand]] also share the same time zone. New Zealand also has Daylight Saving time in effect during late December, but Russia does not (see [[time in New Zealand]] and [[time in Russia]]). This became moot in 1995, however, when the International Date Line was moved to the east of [[Kiribati]] and that country's easternmost time zone (GMT+14) is now the world's earliest.

The Soviet government relocated the indigenous population of Big Diomede Island to mainland Russia, and the island is now inhabited only by military units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/30/you-can-see-russia-from-here/|title=You CAN see Russia from here!|first=Gary|last=Tuchman|date=30 September 2008|work=[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=12 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Little Diomede]] has an [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] Inuit population of 170,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/EPA-IMPACT/2006/December/Day-26/i9854.htm |title=Intent To Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Navigation Improvements and Airport, Little Diomede Island, AK |date=29 October 2009 |publisher=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=12 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821101102/http://www.epa.gov/EPA-IMPACT/2006/December/Day-26/i9854.htm |archivedate=21 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; entirely in the village site on the west side of the island, though the island as a whole comprises the City of [[Diomede, Alaska|Diomede]]. This village has a school and a store. Some Inuit residents are famous for their [[ivory carving]]. When weather permits, air contact is maintained with the island.

He was a son of [[Hendrik Muller Sz.]], a Rotterdam-based Dutch businessman and politician, and [[Marie Cornelie van Rijckevorsel]], member of another prominent Rotterdam based business family.

Muller started his career as a businessman, trading with [[East Africa|East]] and West Africa. In his mid-twenties he travelled to [[Zanzibar]], Mozambique, and South Africa for business purposes, but showed himself a keen [[ethnography|ethnographer]] as well, collecting ethnographic [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] and writing reports about the societies and people he encountered on his way. In 1890, Muller retired from business for personal reasons, and went to Germany to study ethnography and geography. He graduated with a PhD dissertation four years later.

In 1896 he was first appointed consul and later consul general for the [[Orange Free State]]. Muller held this position all through the [[Second Boer War]] and his high-profile performance as European representative for this Boer republic won him considerable fame and notoriety, which lasted all his life. After the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] was signed in 1902 Muller retired to a life of travelling and writing for some years, making Muller a household name with his travel books. In 1919 the Dutch government appointed him envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Romania, and later to [[Czechoslovakia]], where he retired in 1932. As diplomat Muller strongly promoted Dutch business interests, especially in oil and electrotechnics.

Muller was a prolific writer. Over the course of his life he published well over two hundred articles, brochures, and books about his travels through the world, about South Africa and the Boers, and about Dutch foreign policy and diplomacy, apart from a range of other subjects. Muller gathered a large fortune with well appointed private investments. He bequeathed his considerable wealth to a private fund in support of academic research and cultural heritage.

==Biography==

===Early life as businessman===
[[File:Muller in 1882.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Muller as young businessman travelling in East Africa (1882–1883)]]
Hendrik Pieter Nicolaas Muller was born in [[Rotterdam]] (Netherlands) on 2 April 1859, as the third child and second son of [[Hendrik Muller Sz.]] and [[Marie Cornelie van Rijckevorsel]]. His father was a successful businessman based in [[Rotterdam]] and trading with Africa and the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. H.P.N. Muller's maternal grandfather, [[Abram van Rijckevorsel]], was the doyen of the Rotterdam merchant community in the early part of the nineteenth century. Both his father and maternal grandfather were politicians as well, liberals who staunchly defended the principle of [[free trade]], and both were at one time members of the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] of the [[States-General of the Netherlands]].

Muller's paternal grandfather was a German immigrant to the Netherlands and a [[Mennonite Church in the Netherlands|Doopsgezind]] (Mennonite) minister and professor of theology in Amsterdam. The Muller family was fairly prominent in the Netherlands in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, with Christian ministers, professors of literature and history, archivists, antiquarian booksellers, statesmen and businessmen in their midst.	

Muller was destined to step into his father's footsteps and become a businessman. He first attended the private institution Delfos followed by the [[Hogere Burgerschool]] (high school) in [[Rotterdam]], before continuing his education in Germany, at the ''Hohe Real Schule'' in [[Frankfurt-am-Main]], to specialise in trade and business. After finishing his studies with good results, he continued his training with internships in business firms in [[Liverpool]], Manchester, and [[Marseilles]]. His first serious job came when his father called him back to [[Rotterdam]] in 1882, to become interim manager of the [[Handels Compagnie Mozambique]] (Trading Company Mozambique), an ill-performing trading firm doing business in Mozambique. In 1882/'83 Muller travelled to East Africa and visited all the trading posts and establishments of the firm, changing business practices. At the end of his trip he made an extensive tour of South Africa, visiting [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]], [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], the [[Orange Free State]], and the [[Cape Colony]]. On his return to [[Rotterdam]] he advised the directors of the company on business opportunities. Subsequently he was appointed co-director of the reconstituted company, now called the [[Oost-Afrikaansche Compagnie]] (East African Company), as well as deputy manager in his father's firm, Hendrik Muller &amp; Co., which had important trading interests in Liberia and elsewhere in West Africa.

In the 1880s Muller was active for his businesses, and travelled to the [[Congo Conference]] in Berlin in 1884, to Portugal in 1886 and North Africa in 1889. In the same year he succeeded his father as consul general for Liberia in the Netherlands, a position he would hold until 1913. After a third business journey to Africa in 1890, now to Liberia and the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], for Hendrik Muller &amp; Co., he returned home seriously ill, and had to convalesce for months. In this period he fell out with his father and younger brother [[Abram Muller]], about both personal and business matters. It was a personal break that would never be healed and with professional repercussions. In 1891 Muller left business for good and embarked on a totally new career.

===Ethnographer and geographer===
Already in the 1880s, Muller had dabbled in [[ethnography]] and writing. On the basis of materials gathered on his journey to East Africa and South Africa in 1882/’83, he had held public lectures throughout the Netherlands and Belgium. He also published articles on his trip in Dutch magazines and newspapers, and collated these publications into a book titled ''Zuid-Afrika''. It made him somewhat of a celebrity, and an expert on South Africa and East Africa. During his journey Muller had also collected a large number of [[ethnography|ethnographic objects]] and artefacts, on which he published a richly illustrated study in 1892, together with [[Johannes François Snelleman|Joh. F. Snelleman]], curator of the Africa collection in the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]] (National Museum of Ethnology) in [[Leiden]].

Once freed from running the better part of two businesses, and financially independent, Muller went to Germany to study geography and ethnography. He attended lectures at the universities of [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] before completing his doctorate at the [[University of Giessen]] in 1894, summa cum laude. His thesis ''Land und Leute zwischen Zambezi und Limpopo'' (''Land and People between Zambezi and Limpopo'') was mainly based on secondary material, rather than the materials collected and observations made by Muller himself during his time in East Africa. This limited the originality of the study, although in its time it was appreciated as an important piece of academic work, and was also published in a commercial version.

===Consul general for the Orange Free State===

[[File:Muller Toorop drawing.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of Dr. H.P.N. Muller as consul general of the Orange Free State. Artist: [[Jan Toorop]], 1902]]
After his return to the Netherlands, H.P.N. Muller settled down in [[The Hague]], where he was originally only occupied with his consular duties for Liberia, his membership of the Commission for Consular Examinations (since 1890) and his writing. Early in 1896 Muller was appointed as consul for the [[Orange Free State]] in the provinces of North and South Holland, assisting the consul general [[H.A.L. Hamelberg]]. He received the appointment on the strength of his publications about South Africa. After [[H.A.L. Hamelberg|Hamelberg's]] death later in 1896 Muller succeeded him as consul general. It was an honorary position. In the following years Muller wholeheartedly set out to work for the [[Orange Free State]] and its interests in Europe. His predecessor [[H.A.L. Hamelberg|Hamelberg]] had not only been consul general, but had on occasion also acted as [[special envoy]] to be able to negotiate [[treaties]] and accords with foreign powers. Muller also acted as special envoy and in this capacity inter alia enrolled the [[Orange Free State]] in the [[Universal Postal Union]], the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], and the [[Geneva Conventions]], and negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. He also strengthened the consular representation of the [[Orange Free State]] in Europe and inquired into all kinds of practical issues like a cure for [[rinderpest]] and improved methods of [[irrigation]].

In 1898 Muller travelled to South Africa, where he visited [[Cape Town]], the [[Orange Free State]], and the [[Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek]]. In [[Pretoria]] he attended the inauguration of [[President Kruger]] and in [[Bloemfontein]] he struck up a friendship with the newly elected President [[Marthinus Theunis Steyn|M.T. Steyn]] and his family. He also renewed his relations with other leading statesmen, like former President [[Francis William Reitz|F.W. Reitz]], government secretary [[Pieter Jeremias Blignaut|P.J. Blignaut]], and chairman of the [[Volksraad]] [[Cornelius Hermanus Wessels|C.H. Wessels]]. In Cape Town, he was granted an audience with High Commissioner [[Alfred Milner|Sir Alfred Milner]].

[[File:M VA0953.jpg|thumb|upright|Dr. H.P.N. Muller as consul general of the Orange Free State, ''c.'' 1899]]
Once back in the Netherlands, the political situation in South Africa became tense very rapidly, and Muller did all he could to propagate the cause of the [[Boer Republics]] in the press and via diplomatic channels. Once the [[South African War]] broke out in October 1899, Muller set up an elaborate operation to support the cause of the war for the [[Orange Free State]]. He mobilised public support in the Netherlands, Germany and the United States of America and had public gatherings organised. Through his many contacts with the European press Muller saw to it that the Boer cause was extensively covered in the newspapers, usually in his own words, but published in the name of the respective editor. His office in [[The Hague]] was the hub of diplomatic and consular activity in this period, with several secretaries working continuously on the gathering of information and dealing with correspondence. In the war effort Muller cooperated with the [[:nl:Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond|Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond]] in [[Dordrecht]], the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging in [[Amsterdam]], and of course the Transvaal's diplomatic representative in Brussels, Dr. [[Willem Johannes Leyds|W.J. Leyds]]. Originally the relationship between Muller and [[Willem Johannes Leyds|Leyds]] was cordial, but with time it soured and turned into open animosity. Both men were strong personalities with strong convictions. The fact that Muller was only [[consul general]] and [[Willem Johannes Leyds|Leyds]] an accredited diplomat was not helpful either and neither was the fact that – at least in Muller's opinion – the [[Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek]] received much more attention than the [[Orange Free State]]. The first time problems arose in the open was in 1900, when the [[Boer Republics]] sent a joint Special Diplomatic Delegation to Europe and the United States, which was ill-prepared and for which Leyds had very different ideas than Muller.

In 1901 Muller travelled to the United States himself to mobilise support from President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], especially on behalf of the women and children in the British [[concentration camps]]. He also held public lectures all around the country. While visiting Mexico, news reached Muller about the [[Treaty of Vereeniging|Peace of Vereeniging]], making him jobless. Muller took the opportunity to turn his American journey into an expedition. On his return to the Netherlands in 1903 he published a book about it. In the years after the end of the [[South African War]] Muller maintained his interest in South Africa and the [[Afrikaners]], both personally and professionally. In 1904 he supported the [[Steyn family]] when they were in Europe for the President's recovery of a debilitating illness. Until his death Muller was active for the Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond and the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging.

===Travel through Asia===
[[File:HPN Muller VA0967.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Muller in the Dutch East Indies, 1907]]

Between 1907 and 1909 Muller travelled through Asia, a journey that produced several books and articles after his return, including a two-part report of his travels (''Azië gespiegeld''; Asia mirrored).&lt;ref&gt;A translation of selected chapters from part I was published by [[Carool Kersten]] as ''Dr. Muller's Asian Journey. Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Yunnan (1907–1909)'' (Bangkok: White Lotus 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spies, '' 'n Nederlander'', 252–262.&lt;/ref&gt; Muller also published a scientific source publication on Cambodia and the earliest Dutch presence in [[French Indochina]]. The French government rewarded him for it with a knighthood in the [[Légion d'Honneur]] for the latter. The French colony [[Annam (French colony)|Annam]] made Muller a knight in the [[Order of the Dragon of Annam|Order of the Dragon]] for his contributions to the history of Vietnam.

Muller's Asian trip was comprehensive. He visited [[British India]] and Ceylon, Burma, Malaysia and the Philippines and [[French Indochina]], travelled extensively through the [[Dutch East Indies]], and returned via Japan, [[Korea]] – where he had an audience with the last Korean emperor&lt;ref&gt;Muller, ''Azië gespiegeld'', part I, 369–371.&lt;/ref&gt; –, [[Manchuria]], China, and [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;On the Philippines, Siam, French Indo China, Korea, Manchuria, and Siberia: Muller, ''Azië gespiegeld'', part I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On China: Muller, ''Azië gespiegeld'', part II, 174–286.&lt;/ref&gt; Muller's visit to Japan triggered a lively interest in this country and its economic development potential. Back in the Netherlands he presented his views on the country in several speeches, brochures, and articles, mainly under the auspices of the [[Comité Nederland-Japan]] (Dutch-Japanese Committee).&lt;ref&gt;Muller, ''Zij en wij''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch government official and diplomat===
In 1914, at the outbreak of [[World War I]], Muller's career took a new turn. The [[Dutch government]] appointed him government commissioner in charge of one of the main Belgian Refugee Camps in the Netherlands. Muller was charged with the transfer of the camp from a makeshift army encampment in [[Oldebroek]] to a proper refugee camp with full provisions in [[Nunspeet]]. He took to the job with great enthusiasm, but resigned a year later, declaring that he had attained the goals he had set himself on his appointment. Actually the resignation came in a cloud of controversy around his person and policies. At the end of World War I the Dutch prime minister did acknowledge the high quality of Muller's work in setting up the camps and bringing and maintaining order and human dignity under very trying circumstances. Apart from his position as member of the Consular Examinations Commission, this position was the only Dutch government appointment Muller held inside the Netherlands.

From the 1890s onwards, Muller had published with great regularity about the importance of a proper Dutch consular service to promote the Dutch mercantile interests around the world. In his articles he forcefully advanced the idea that the consular and diplomatic services should be merged and professionalised. In his publications Muller also strongly propagated a more active role of the Netherlands in [[international relations|international affairs]]. In this vain, in 1919, he published an article on the history and geography of [[Spitsbergen]] ([[Svalbard]]) and the necessity for the Dutch government to defend its historic claims on the islands. A year later, the Dutch government became a signatory to the [[Spitsbergen Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;
Muller, Hendrik, ‘Nederland's historische rechten op Spitsbergen’, ''Tijdschrift van het Koninklijk Nederlandsch Aardrijkskundig Genootschap'' 2e serie, deel 34 (1919) no. 1, 94–104; [[s:Spitsbergen Treaty|Spitsbergen Treaty (full text in Wikisource)]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, now already sixty years old, he got the chance to put his opinions on Dutch foreign policy into practice. In that year the Dutch government appointed him [[Diplomatic rank|Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] to Romania, a country in the throes of political and economic transformation. The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in petroleum. Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to [[Czechoslovakia]]. In [[Prague]] he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, ''inter alia'' looking after the interests of the Dutch electrotechnical firm [[Philips]].

He resigned his post in 1932 after being requested to step back by the Dutch minister of Foreign Affairs, who wished to free some senior diplomatic posts for younger diplomats waiting to be appointed envoy. Muller decided not take his pension, allowing him to keep his title of [[Diplomatic rank|Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] until his death.

===Dutch history and heritage===
[[File:De Witt unveiling.jpg|right|thumb|Unveiling of statue of [[Johan de Witt]] on the Plaats in [[The Hague]] by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] (front); H.P.N. Muller in third group.]]
From an early age Muller was interested in Dutch history, especially in the great national achievements of the Dutch during the centuries. During his lifetime Muller translated his interests in several concrete projects.

[[File:Johan de Witt-TheHague.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Statue of [[Johan de Witt]] on the Plaats in [[The Hague]] by F.E. Jeltsema.]]
In line with his historical interests he initiated the erection of a statue for the murdered [[Grand Pensionary]] of Holland, [[Johan de Witt]] (1625–1672). The statue was designed and made by the Dutch sculptor [[Frederik Engel Jeltsema]]. The unveiling in [[The Hague]] on 12 June 1918 was a national event. The actual unveiling was done by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], with several ministers in attendance. The statue stands close to the place where De Witt and his brother [[Cornelis de Witt|Cornelis]] were killed by a mob in 1672. On the side of the socle a text is engraved which – in translation – reads: 'Leader and servant of the Republic, designer of it most powerful fleets, defender of the [[freedom of the seas]], caretaker of the State's coffers, mathematician. He was a perfect Dutchman.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vriendenvandewitt.nl website Vrienden van De Witt] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; Muller had an important hand in the formulation of the text.

Muller funded the erection of a plaque in honour of the Dutch seventeenth-century [[admiral]] [[Maarten Harpertsz. Tromp]] in the newly built [[City Hall]] of his birthplace [[Rotterdam]].

===Retirement===
In the years after 1932 Muller travelled a little around Europe and retired to his house in [[The Hague]]. He remained involved in cultural and academic activities, organised his papers, and kept a keen interest in South African affairs. In the last years of his life he was honoured in several ways, among others with an [[honorary doctorate]] in law from the [[University of South Africa]], a bust in the hall of the Eeufeesgebou of the [[University of the Free State]], with a copy in the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]] (National Museum of Ethnology) in [[Leiden]], and an honorary diner party by the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in London. Without children and never fully reconciled with his family, Muller left almost his complete estate to the [[:nl:Dr. Hendrik Muller’s Vaderlandsch Fonds|Dr. Hendrik Muller's Vaderlandsch Fonds]] for the support of academic research and cultural heritage. Finally his health failed more and more and H.P.N. Muller died in his house in [[The Hague]] on 11 August 1941. He was buried in the cemetery of [[:nl:Oud Eik en Duinen|Oud Eik en Duinen]] in [[The Hague]] in a grand ceremony, with the Dutch flag covering the coffin and the [[national anthem]] being played, in defiance of the [[:nl:Nederland in de Tweede Wereldoorlog|German Nazi occupation]] and as a – somewhat old-fashioned – celebration of Dutch [[cultural identity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kranten.kb.nl/Exe/ZyNET.exe/1941_08_15_2_03.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=Koninklijke+Bibliotheek&amp;Index=het%20Centrum%20%281910-1930%29%7Cde%20NRC%20%281910-1930%29%7Chet%20Vaderland%20%281920-1945%29%7Chet%20Volk%20%281910-1920%29&amp;Query=hendrik%20AND%20muller&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=Datum%5E%3E19410801%3A%3C19410829%7CEditie%5E&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;UseQField=Datum&amp;File=E%3A%5CZYDATA%5CDATA%5CGADH01%5CVADERLAND%5CEXPORT%5CTXT%5C236%5F237%5C1941%5F08%5F15%5F2%5F03.txt&amp;User=anonymous&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=n%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=20&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r65g4/r65g4/x150y150g16/i360&amp;Display=hpfr&amp;DefSeekPage=f&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=f 'Begrafenis Dr. H.P.N. Muller', Het Vaderland 15 August 1941]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the attendants were several former government ministers and high-ranking military officers, university professors, former diplomats, representatives of cultural and scientific organisations, and friends from his South African period and after.
[[File:Grave of HPN Muller.jpg|thumb|Grave of Muller at [[Oud Eik en Duinen]] in The Hague]]

During his lifetime H.P.N. Muller was well respected for his work. He was extensively decorated by almost all the countries he worked for or in, in many cases with the highest distinction. He was made a [[Knight Grand Cross]] in military and civilian orders of Portugal, Liberia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, [[Czechoslovakia]] and the Netherlands, was commander of the French [[Legion of Honour]], and knight in orders of Liberia, [[Order of the Dragon of Annam|Annam]] and the Netherlands. Apart from having his bust placed in the University of the Free State, the Bloemfontein municipal authorities named a street after him.

Although highly decorated, honoured and well respected for his work, Muller was not an easy person. This shows through in a consistently bad press he received during his lifetime and after, which highlights his eccentricities and his at times volatile character.

== Legacy ==
The [[Dr Hendrik Muller Prize]] for Behavioural and Social Sciences was named after Hendrik Muller. The prize is awarded every other year by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] to a researcher who has made a valuable contribution to the behavioural and social sciences.

==Concise bibliography==
During his life, H.P.N. Muller published well over 200 books, articles, columns, and papers. Many of these – especially his newspaper articles – were published anonymously. Many of the (propaganda) articles he wrote about the [[South African War]] when he was consul general for the [[Orange Free State]] were published secretly, often under another journalist's or newspaper editor's name, to maximise the public relations effect.

This bibliography only lists Muller's main book publications and some key articles.

The '''Iron Gate Pass''' connects the [[Yanqi Basin]] and the [[Tarim Basin]] in central [[Xinjiang]], [[China]]. The pass follows the gorge of the [[Kaidu River|Kongque River]]. The main settlements linked by the pass are the town of Yanqi in the [[Yanqi Hui Autonomous County]] to the north and the city of [[Korla]] in the [[Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture]] in the south. The first town immediately to the north of the pass is [[Tashidian]]. The Iron Gate Pass was of historical strategical significance because it formed a vulnerable bottle-neck on the [[Silk Road]]. A military checkpoint was established at the pass during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. At present, the pass is no longer part of the road infrastructure of the region and is preserved as a scenic and historical area. The modern road ([[G218]]) from Yanqi to Korla passes through the mountains to the east of the gorge.

The gorge of the Iron Gate Pass is the setting of a legendary love story.&lt;ref name="sharplinks"&gt;[http://www.sharplinks.com/cct/silkroad/attractions/iron-gate-pass.html Iron Gate Pass]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="travelchina"&gt;[http://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/xinjiang/korla/iron_gate.htm  Tiemen Pass (Iron Gate)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the legend, a princess of the Kingdom of Yanqi called Tzouhla had fallen in love with a poor herdsman named Tayir. The royal court opposed the relationship and a minister Karehan convinced the king to have Tayir killed. As the princess tried to rescue her lover from the king's soldiers, they both fell to their death in the gorge. A [[tumulus]] is said to mark the place where the two lovers were buried opposite to the gate to the pass.&lt;ref name="travelchina" /&gt;

'''Diana Leung Wai-tung''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]], [[Justice of Peace|JP]] ({{zh-t|梁煒彤}}; born 1946) is a former member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]].

==Biography==
Leung studied at the [[Belilios Public School]] and attend the [[University of Hong Kong]], obtained her bachelor's degree in geography and geology in 1968 and master's degree in urban geography in 1973. She worked as a lecturer at Department of Geography and Geology at [[Hong Kong University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Database on LegCo members|url=http://app.legco.gov.hk/member_front/english/library/member_detail.aspx?id=133|accessdate=4 May 2013|work=Legislative Council of Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was appointed to the Legislative Council by Governor [[David Clive Wilson|David Wilson]] in 1988. She and [[Edward Leong]] and [[Jimmy McGregor]], two other legislators, launched the [[Hong Kong Democratic Foundation]] in 1989 and Leung served as the founding vice-chairperson, which was seen as pro-democratic liberal political group at the time. She was one of the only three appointed members who affiliated with political organisation (the other two being [[Maria Tam]] and [[Lau Wong-fat]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Other Hong Kong Report 1991|first=Anthony|last=Lawrence|year=1991|page=72|publisher=Chinese University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; She soon quit the foundation citing her difference with the mainstream members.

She was considered as radical among the majority of the appointed and pro-government legislative councillors, as she and [[Szeto Wah]] urged for repealing the government's regulation of political activities in schools, instead of moderating as the government revised on the Education (Amendment) Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Education in Hong Kong, 1941 to 2001: Visions and Revisions|first=Anthony|last=Sweeting|page=398|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the only appointed member to vote against the Trade Description Amendment Bill of 1991, a bill that sparked criticism from labour groups.

She was also the member of the [[Hong Kong Housing Authority]] from 1985 until her resignation on 5 November 1996.

She was one of the six female candidates in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1991|1991 Legislative Council election]], the first ever direct election in the territory but was defeated by the candidates from the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]], notably [[Martin Lee]] in [[Hong Kong Island East (constituency)|Hong Kong Island East]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12566">{{Latin place names}}

This list includes places in [[Great Britain]] (including neighbouring islands such as the [[Isle of Man]]), some of which were part of the [[Roman Empire]], or were later given [[Latin]] place names in [[historical]] [[Reference work|references]].

==Background==
Until the [[Modern Era]], [[Latin]] was the [[Lingua franca|common language]] for [[scholarship]] and [[Cartography|mapmaking]]. During the 19th and 20th centuries, [[Germany|German]] scholars in particular have made significant contributions to the study of historical place names, or ''Ortsnamenkunde''. These studies have, in turn, contributed to the study of [[genealogy]]. For genealogists and historians of pre-Modern Europe, knowing alternative names of places is vital to extracting information from both public and private records. Even specialists in this field point out, however, that the information can be easily taken out of context, since there is a great deal of repetition of place names throughout Europe; reliance purely on apparent connections should therefore be tempered with valid historical methodology.

==Caveats and notes==
Latin place names are not always exclusive to one place &amp;mdash; for example, there were several Roman cities whose names began with ''Colonia'' and then a more descriptive term.  During the [[Middle Ages]], these were often shortened to just ''Colonia''. One of these, ''Colonia Agrippinensis'', retains the name today in the form of [[Cologne]] (from French, German Köln).

Early sources for [[ancient Rome|Roman]] names show numerous variants and spellings of the [[Latin]] names.

The modern canonical name is listed first. 
Sources are listed chronologically. 
In general, only the earliest source is shown for each name, although many of the names are recorded in more than one of the sources. 
Where the source differs in spelling, or has other alternatives, these are listed following the source. 
As an aid to searching, variants are spelled completely, 
and listed in most likely chronology.

Superscripts indicate:
# Latinized form of the Greek-derived name.
# Latinized form of the Asian-derived name via Greek.
# Altered Latinized form of the Greek-derived name.

'?' probably historical mistake

[[File:Lifeboat Station - Porthcawl - geograph.org.uk - 1400792.jpg|thumb|Inshore lifeboat station, which uses a carriage to launch lifeboats.]]

'''Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) stations''' are the bases for the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI]]'s fleet of search and rescue [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] that cover the coastal waters around the entire [[British Isles]], as well as major inland waterways.

The service was established in 1824 and is operated largely by volunteers. Its headquarters are at [[Poole]], [[Dorset]] and it is a registered charity in both the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland]].

== Key ==
=== Lifeboat types ===
{{Main|Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats}}
The types of boats provided at each station and the launching methods vary depending on local needs. If more than one boat is provided they are sometimes stationed in separate buildings at different locations in the same town. RNLI boats fall into three broad groups:
* All weather lifeboats (ALBs): {{Lbb|Mersey}}, {{Lbb|Severn}}, {{Lbb|Shannon}}, {{Lbb|Tamar}}, {{Lbb|Trent}} and {{Lbb|Tyne}}
* Inshore lifeboats (ILBs): {{Lbc|D|IB1}}, {{Lbb|Atlantic 75}}, {{Lbb|Atlantic 85}} and {{Lbc|E}}
* Hovercraft: [[RNLI hovercraft lifeboat|''H''-class]]

=== Launch methods ===
[[File:Minehead - launching D-712 (2).jpg|thumb|'Tooltrack' tractor launching an inshore lifeboat at {{lbs|Minehead}}]]
The principal launching methods are:

* Carriage – an ALB or ILB is pushed into the water on a carriage by a tractor
* Davit – an ILB is lowered into the water by a crane
* Launchway – an ILB is pushed into the water on a carriage by hand
* Moored afloat – an ALB or ILB is kept in the water alongside the lifeboat station or nearby, in which case a small boarding boat is provided so that the crew can reach it.
* Slipway – an ALB slides down a slipway straight into the water.
* Transporter – hovercraft are kept on the rear of trucks that can transport and offload them anywhere

=== Divisions ===
The following lists do not include the lifeguard patrolled beaches which also have their own equipment including [[Arancia-class lifeboat|inflatable boats]] and [[jetski]]s. The information is correct to 2009 unless noted otherwise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Denton |first= Tony |title= Handbook 2009 |year= 2009 |publisher= Lifeboat Enthusiasts Society |location= Shrewsbury |pages= 66–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is set out like the RNLI's divisional model. As far as possible it follows a clockwise route around the coast.

* East Division – [[East Anglia]] and South East England
* South Division – South West England and the [[Channel Islands]]
* West Division – [[Wales]] and the [[Isle of Man]]
* North Division – East and west coasts of northern England
* Scotland Division – [[Scotland]]
* Ireland Division – [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]

[[File:EU diplomatic missions.svg|thumb|400px|{{legend|#22b14c|European Union}}
{{legend|#2f3699|Countries with EU delegations}}]]
{{Distinguish|text = [[List of military and civilian missions of the European Union]], referring to missions of the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]]}}
The member states of the [[European Union]] are aligned in their foreign policy on many issues. The EU is the world's largest [[trade bloc|economic union]], [[customs union]] and donor of humanitarian and development assistance and thus has an extensive network of delegations around the world mainly operating in the framework of [[Foreign relations of the European Union|External Relations]], for which the [[European Commission]] is the main decision body. The EU also represents shared political and security viewpoints held by its member states, as articulated in the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]].

The EU's predecessor, the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], opened its first mission in London in 1955, three years after non-EU countries began to accredit their missions in [[Brussels]] to the Community. The US had been a fervent supporter of the ECSC's efforts from the beginning, and Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] sent [[Jean Monnet]] a dispatch in the name of President Truman confirming full US diplomatic recognition of the ECSC. A US ambassador to the ECSC was accredited soon thereafter, and he headed the second overseas mission to establish diplomatic relations with the Community institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/delegations/docs/50_years_brochure_en.pdf Taking Europe to the world: 50 years of the European Commission's External Service]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of delegates began to rise in the 1960s following the merging of the executive institutions of the three European Communities into a single Commission. Until recently some states had reservations accepting that EU delegations held the full status of a [[diplomatic mission]]. Article 20 of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] requires the Delegations and the Member States’ diplomatic missions to "co-operate in ensuring that the common positions and joint actions adopted by the Council are complied with and implemented".

Management of the [[Foreign relations of the European Union|EU External Relations]] is conducted by the [[European External Action Service]] which reports to the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative for Foreign Affairs]]. Delegates are generally sent only to capital cities and cities hosting multilateral bodies.

The EU missions work separately from the work of the missions of its member states, however in some circumstances it may share resources and facilities. In [[Abuja]], the EU mission shares its premises with a number of member states.&lt;ref&gt;Unified External Service of the European Commission Unified External Service of the European Commission&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission also maintains representation in each of the [[Member state of the European Union|member states]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/represent_en.htm Representations of the European Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; For details on diplomatic representation, see [[Foreign relations of the European Union#Diplomatic representation]].

==Notes==
&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; As part of the process of establishment of the [[European External Action Service]] envisioned in the recently ratified [[Treaty of Lisbon]], on 1 January 2010 all former ''European Commission delegations'' were renamed into ''European Union delegations'' and till the end of the month 54 of the missions (marked with &lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; in the list above) were transformed into [[embassy]]-type missions that employ greater powers than the regular delegations. These upgraded delegations have taken on the role previously carried out by the national embassies of the member state holding the rotating [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/29308 EU commission 'embassies' granted new powers], [[EUobserver]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metropolitan Stockholm''' (also known as Greater Stockholm or, in Swedish, ''Storstockholm''), is a [[metropolitan area]] surrounding the Swedish capital of Stockholm. Since 2005, Metropolitan Stockholm is defined by official Swedish Statistics as all of [[Stockholm County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scb.se/statistik/_publikationer/OV9999_2004A01_BR_X20OP0502.pdf SCB Statistics Sweden – Regional Divisions in Sweden published in 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest of the three metropolitan areas in Sweden.

Metropolitan Stockholm is divided into 5 areas: [[Stockholm City Centre]], [[Söderort]], [[Västerort]] of [[Stockholm Municipality]]; and the northern suburbs and southern suburbs, which consists of several municipalities.

'''Metropolitan Gothenburg''' (''Storgöteborg'' or literally Greater Gothenburg), is a metropolitan area surrounding the city of [[Gothenburg]] in [[Sweden]]. The metropolitan region is located in [[Västra Götaland County]], except for the [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipality]] of [[Kungsbacka Municipality|Kungsbacka]], which is located to the south in [[Halland County]]. As of 2005, the municipalities of [[Alingsås Municipality|Alingsås]] and [[Lilla Edet Municipality|Lilla Edet]] were added to the region. The region is often used for statistical measures, and estimates in the 1960s predicted that the region would have about one million inhabitants in the year 2000. The region is the second largest metropolitan area in Sweden after [[Metropolitan Stockholm]].

==Metropolitan Malmö==
[[File:Metropolitan Malmö ver.1.PNG|right|thumb|350px]]
[[File:Malmo view2.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The Øresund strait between Malmö and Copenhagen with Malmö in the foreground and the island of Amager and part of southern Copenhagen in the background]]

'''Greater Malmö''' (''Stormalmö''), also known as '''Metropolitan Malmö''' is the [[metropolitan area]] of [[Malmö]] in [[Sweden]]. The area is located in Southwestern [[Scania]] (''Sydvästra Skåne''), which is often considered synonymous with Greater Malmö, and it is part of the wider transnational [[Greater Copenhagen (metropolitan region)|Öresund Region]]. Besides Malmö, large towns in Greater Malmö includes [[Lund]] and [[Trelleborg]], the former of which was the seat of the historical [[Diocese of Lund#Catholic History|Catholic Archdiocese of Lund]].

Since the [[1970s]], improvements in [[highway]]s and the [[Pågatåg|regional]] and [[Øresundståg|InterRegio]] train networks means the commuting area has grown to include [[Ystad]], [[Skurup]], [[Sjöbo]], [[Eslöv]], [[Höör]], [[Landskrona]] and [[Helsingborg]], though only some of these are included in official definitions of Greater Malmö. It's not uncommon to live in Malmö and work either in Ystad or Helsingborg, or vice versa, but these towns have kept their mental allegiance with older divisions of Scania. Commuting across the [[Øresund|Öresund]] has become more common, both through the [[Øresund Bridge]] and the [[HH Ferry route]], at which car ferries departs every 12 minutes in summer (every 15 minutes in winter).

[[Statistics Sweden]], which sets the official definitions for all metropolitan areas in Sweden, has changed which [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]] are included in Greater Malmö over time. The most recent change to the definition came in 2006, when [[Eslöv Municipality|Eslöv]], [[Höör Municipality|Höör]], and [[Skurup Municipality|Skurup]] Municipalities became part of Greater Malmö, bringing the number of municipalities included from 9 to 12.

'''Domenico "Mimmo" Rotella''', ([[Catanzaro]], 7 October 1918 &amp;ndash; [[Milan]], 8 January 2006), was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[artist]] considered an important figure in post-war European art. Best known for his works of [[décollage]] and [[psychogeographics]], made from torn advertising posters. He was associated to the [[Ultra-Lettrists]] an offshoot of [[Lettrism]] and later was a member of the ''[[Nouveau realisme|Nouveau Réalisme]]'', founded in 1960 by the art critic [[Pierre Restany]].

==Biography==

=== 1918-1951 ===
After finishing school studies he moves to [[Naples]] in 1933 to pursue his artistic studies, but he got a job at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. In 1941, he moved to [[Rome]]. He remains in the capital only for a short period, because he is called up. In 1944 he left the army and he graduated from the Art School of Naples. Between 1944 and 1945 he teaches drawing in [[Catanzaro]]. In 1945 he returned to Rome and, following his figurative beginnings and first experimentations, he began to paint new-geometric paintings. He starts in 1947 to participate at the exhibition, with the Exhibition Board of Fine Arts and the annual Art Club. In 1949 he devoted himself to the phonetic poetry experiments, calling epistaltic (a meaningless neologism), which in the same year he draws up the Manifesto (published by L.Sinisgalli in "Civilization of machines")

=== 1951-1953 ===
In 1951 he had his first contact with French art, exhibiting in [[Paris]] at the Salon des [[Nouveau réalisme|Nouvelles Réalités]]. Between 1951 and 1952, he obtained the award of a scholarship from the [[Fulbright Foundation]], which allows him to travel to the US as an "Artist in Residence" at the University of Kansas City. Also in 1952 he realized the second personal exhibithion at the Rockhill Nelson Gallery in Kansas City. In the United States he had the opportunity to meet representatives of the new artistic currents: [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Yves Klein]].

=== 1953 ===
In 1953, he suffers from an artistic crisis, during which interrupts his pictorial production. Now convinced that there is nothing to be done again in art, suddenly what he calls "Zen illumination": the discovery of the advertising poster as artistic expression of the city. Thus the [[décollage]] (early collages) was born: paste on canvas pieces of torn posters of the street, by adopting the collages of the [[Cubism|cubists]] and contaminating it with [[Dada]]ist array of [[Found object|ready made]]. In 1955, in Rome, in the exhibition "actual art exhibition", he exhibited for the first time the 'torn poster'. Later, he practiced the so-called double décollage: the poster firstly removed from the billboard, then torn up in his studio. In those years he also made use of the retro d'affiche, using the posters pasted on the side and obtaining non-figurative and [[Monochrome painting|monochrome]] works.

=== 1953-1960 ===
The first awards arrive in 1956 with the Graziano Award and in 1957 with the Battistoni Prize and Public Education. With the [[Cinecittà]] series of 1958, select figures and faces of film advertising directing production toward more figurative works. At the end of the Fifties, Rotella, is labeled by critics as a ripper or painter of glued paper. At night, tearing not only posters but also pieces of sheet metal from frames of the billboard zones of the Rome Municipality. In 1958 he receives in Rome the visit of the French critic [[Pierre Restany]], with whom he began a long association. In the same year he participated in Rome in the exhibition "New Italian art trends" organized by [[Lionello Venturi]] in the seat of Rome - New York Art Foundation. The curiosity of the public for the artist's extravagances, culminated in 1960 with the creation, the work of Enzo Nasso, a short film dedicated to angry Painters, which cure Rotella spoken commentary.

=== 1960-1980 ===
Also in 1960 he joined the [[Nouveau réalisme|New Realism]] - but he didn't sign the manifesto - theorist of which [[Pierre Restany]] and bringing together, among others, [[Yves Klein]], [[Daniel Spoerri|Spoerri]], [[Jean Tinguely|Tinguely]], César, [[Arman]] and [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]]. The group will also take part in the French [[Raymond Hains|Hains]], Dufrêne and [[Jacques Villeglé|Villeglé]], operating on [[décollage]] in the same years, but independently.
Together with décollages, Rotella also performs assemblage of objects bought from junk dealers as bottle caps or cords. [[Pop art|Pop Art]] and [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]], with the Informal and the spatial and material research in those years, [[Lucio Fontana]] and [[Alberto Burri]] taking place in Italy, they play an important role in the orientation of Rotella. In 1961 he composed a historical exhibition À 40 ° au-dessus de Dada, edited in Paris by Restany. In 1962 he gives a presentation on his art at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in New York and in 1964 he was invited to the [[Venice Biennale]] and, in 1965, the IX Quadrennial of Rome.
Using typographic tools, between 1967 and 1973 he created his Art-typo, prints chosen and reproduced freely on the canvas. This procedure is able to overlap and superimpose advertising images, reversing the previous approach.
In the early seventies produces some works by intervening on the advertising pages of magazines with the use of solvents and reducing or state at the imprint (frottage) or deleting one (effaçage). In 1972, he published his autobiography entitled Autorotella.
In 1975 he recorded his first disc of phonetic poetry and in 1976 he took part in the "International Poetry Recital Sonora - Poetry Action". Another trial, in those years, it is that of rolling up posters and closing them in plexiglass cubes.

=== 1980-2006 ===
Finally he left Paris to settle in [[Milan]] (1980), in the eighties he processes the "blanks" or affiches covers: zeroed advertising posters covered with white sheets, as with the expired advertisement. In 1984 he made the second cycle of works dedicated to the cinema: Cinecittà 2. After 1986 he realizes 'Sovrapitture', inspired by graffiti: intervenes pictorially of torn poster glued on canvas. It drew anonymous writings, such as those that can be read on city walls: love notes and political slogans, etc., in a double message. In 1990 he participated at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Centre Pompidou]] in Paris in the exhibition "Art et Pub" and the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] exhibition "High and Low". He married in 1991 with the Russian Inna Agarounova, and in 1993 they had a child called Asya.
In 1992 from the French Minister of Culture, [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]], he receives the title of 'Officiel des arts et des Lettres'.
A foundation dedicated to him was established in 2000, to the artist's will: the 'Fondazione Mimmo Rotella', with the aim of collecting the works and documents cataloged in the artistic life of the teacher. In 2004 Rotella received an honorary degree in Architecture at the University Mediterranea of [[Reggio Calabria]].

He was invited to the [[New York City|New York]] [[List of Guggenheim Museums|Guggenheim Museum]] in 1994 for the exhibition "Italian Metamorphosis", then again at the Centre Pompidou in 1996 in "Face à l'Histoire", and in 1996 the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in "Halls of Mirrors "exhibition subsequently exported all over the world. The [[Federico Fellini]] film dedicates the series of works called Fellini.

He died in Milan on January 8, 2006 at the age of 88 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-11-09|title=Mimmo Rotella|url=https://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mimmo_Rotella&amp;oldid=84212670|journal=Wikipedia|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork==

=== Décollages ===
[[Décollage]] is an artistic technique of collage to the opposite procedure. Instead of adding elements of the work, it starts from an artistic object from which the parts are detached. The idea of decollage was born during a period of "artistic crisis" and took place following the trip to the US, during which he was in contact with members of the [[Neo-Dada|New Dada]]. Back in Rome he became inspired by torn posters around the town and began to carry them in his studio and to work on them. The result was the creation of canvases on which pasted wheel one or more pieces of torn posters, often superimposed. Rotella wanted to somehow find some form of artistic innovation and at the same time give artistic dignity to a common object, and of little value removed from its natural environment.
The first trials of Rotella with decollage date back to 1953. The first decollage, in most small cases, were exhibited for the first time in the spring of 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-11-09|title=Mimmo Rotella|url=https://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mimmo_Rotella&amp;oldid=84212670|journal=Wikipedia|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retro d'affiches ===
The two roads that Rotella takes on simultaneously, starting in 1953-1954 are those of decollage and retro posters. The first retro d'affiche documented date back to 1954. The retro d'affiche are displayed for the first time to the public in December 1955 at the personal exhibition the artist held at the Galleria del Naviglio in [[Milan]]. Unlike decollage where often textural layers are wrapped together and manipulated, in the back of posters the artist retains the "urban relic". In these works his speech tends to be subtle, the colors are often absent, the surface is gritty and raw, it has compared to decollage a more targeted research to informal language, except that it will become evident starting especially from the sixties when decollages in expected to bet influenced by the rising [[Pop art|pop language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-11-09|title=Mimmo Rotella|url=https://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mimmo_Rotella&amp;oldid=84212670|journal=Wikipedia|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mimmo Rotella: Decollages e retro d'affiches|last=Germano|first=Celant|publisher=SKIRA|year=2014|isbn=978-88-572-2328-5|location=Milan|pages=35–38|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assault on climbers==

On 27 April, three climbers were attacked by a group of 100 Sherpas at 21,000 feet elevation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/10037481/What-drove-100-Sherpas-to-attack-Western-climbers-on-Everest.html|title=What drove 100 Sherpas to attack Western climbers on Everest?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was seen as an aberration in the otherwise decades-long spirit of teamwork and friendship on the mountain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Sherpas have a reputation for going to extraordinary lengths for climbers, and being generous in sharing Everest with visitors to Nepal.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk" /&gt; 

Earlier in the day, a group of three climbers on the Lhotse Face had crossed over lines being laid by the Sherpas, contrary to the etiquette that climbers should avoid Sherpas working on the mountain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Words were exchanged and the situation escalated. An ice pick was brandished and ice and stones were thrown. The Sherpas then left the Lhotse Face, but later visited the camp site with about 100 others and threatened to kill one of the three climbers. The climber was upset because he considered himself a friend of the Sherpa community, had built a school for nearly 400 Sherpa children, and also had funded free evacuations via helicopters for Sherpas.&lt;ref name="fight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130502-mount-everest-fight-simone-moro-interview-sherpas/|title=Everest Climber: Sherpas Tried to Kill Me|work=National Geographic |access-date= 21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="outsideonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/1929351/everest-brawl-sherpas-tale |title=The Everest Brawl: A Sherpa's Tale |last1=Adhikari |first1=Deepak|date=13 August 2013 |work=Outside |access-date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She then negotiated a truce between the mountaineers.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk" /&gt;

The three ringleaders of the attack were removed from the mountain.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk" /&gt; Sherpas are renowned for the most part for their climbing skill and demeanour, with one Everest climber noting, "To a man everyone seems to be absolutely impressed with the Sherpas. Not just their strength on the mountain, which is legendary, but their personalities and their friendliness. They become your friends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://netnebraska.org/article/news/1029247/nebraskan-climbed-mount-everest%E2%80%A6and-it-almost-killed-him |title=A Nebraskan climbed Mount Everest...and it almost killed him |last1=Tobias |first1=Mike |last2= |first2= |date=22 June 2016 |website=Net Nebraska |access-date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight led to improved communication between the people on the mountain, which helped to overcome the cultural and language barriers that complicated an already difficult environment.&lt;ref name="outsideonline.com" /&gt;

==Fatalities==
There were 8 fatalities attributed to mountaineering.&lt;ReF&gt;[http://www.alanarnette.com/blog/2013/06/03/everest-2013-season-recap/]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the losses was the well-known and respected climber, Alexi Bolotov, who died in the Khumbu Icefall when the rope he was rappelling down broke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1797216/alex-bolotov-dies-everest|title=Alex Bolotov Dies on Everest|last=Rosenfield|first=Scott|date=2013-05-15|work=Outside Online|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern Bulgaria''' ({{lang-bg|Северна България}}, ''Severna Balgariya''), also called '''Moesia''' ({{lang-bg|Мизия}}, ''Miziya'') is the northern half of the territory of [[Bulgaria]], located to the north of the main ridge of the [[Balkan Mountains]] which conventionally separates the country into a northern and a southern part. Besides the Balkan Mountains, Northern Bulgaria borders the [[Timok River]] and [[Serbia]] to the west, the [[Danube River]] and [[Romania]] to the north and the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]] to the east.

Geographically, the [[terrain]] is relatively uniform, dominated by the hilly [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]], with some low [[plateau]]s to the east. Northern Bulgaria covers an area of 48,596 square kilometres and has a population of 2,674,347 according to the 2011 census&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsi.bg/ORPDOCS/Census2011_1.pop_by_age.xls Population by province, municipality, settlement and age by 01.02.2011; Bulgarian National Statistical Institute] {{bg icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; (36% of Bulgaria's entire population), with a [[population density]] of 55 people per km². The three largest cities are [[Varna]], [[Rousse]] and [[Pleven]].

Administratively, Northern Bulgaria includes the following 14 [[Provinces of Bulgaria|Bulgarian provinces]]:

* [[Dobrich Province]]
* [[Gabrovo Province]]
* [[Lovech Province]]
* [[Montana Province]]
* [[Pleven Province]]
* [[Razgrad Province]]
* [[Rousse Province]]
* [[Shumen Province]]
* [[Silistra Province]]
* [[Targovishte Province]]
* [[Varna Province]]
* [[Veliko Tarnovo Province]]
* [[Vidin Province]]
* [[Vratsa Province]]

Parts of [[Burgas Province]], [[Sliven Province]], and [[Sofia Province]] also geographically belong to Northern Bulgaria. 

Northern Bulgaria covers the historical region of [[Moesia]], which in turn includes several sub-regions such as [[Southern Dobruja|Dobruja]] (sometimes not considered part of Moesia), [[Ludogorie]], [[Gerlovo]] and [[Zlatiya (region)|Zlatiya]]. Northern Bulgaria is also conventionally divided into [[Severozapaden|Northwestern]], [[Severen tsentralen|Central Northern]] and [[Severoiztochen|Northeastern]] Bulgaria, with slightly varying borders. The lower northern reaches of the Balkan Mountains are called the [[Fore-Balkan]], as opposed to the [[Sub-Balkan valleys]] to the south of the main ridge. In Antiquity, the [[Jireček Line]] divided [[Latin]] (in the north) and [[Ancient Greek]] (in the south) language influence in the [[Balkans]], with Northern Bulgaria to the north of it and Southern Bulgaria to the south. Much later, after the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] in 1878, all of Northern Bulgaria and the region of [[Sofia]] became the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] while most of the rest of Southern Bulgaria was part of [[Eastern Rumelia]] until the [[Bulgarian unification]] in 1885.

Laherrère and D. Sornette&lt;/ref&gt; except in the cases of the two "[[King effect|Kings]]": [[China]] and [[India]].]]
'''Rank-size distribution''' is the distribution of size by rank, in decreasing order of size. For example, if a data set consists of items of sizes 5, 100, 5, and 8, the rank-size distribution is 100, 8, 5, 5 (ranks 1 through 4). This is also known as the '''rank-frequency distribution''', when the source data are from a [[frequency distribution]]. These are particularly of interest when the data vary significantly in scale, such as city size or word frequency. These distributions frequently follow a [[power law]] distribution, or less well-known ones such as a [[stretched exponential function]] or [[parabolic fractal distribution]], at least approximately for certain ranges of ranks; see below.

A rank-size distribution is not a [[probability distribution]] or [[cumulative distribution function]]. Rather, it is a discrete form of a [[quantile function]] (inverse cumulative distribution) in reverse order, giving the size of the element at a given rank.

==Simple rank-size distributions==
In the case of city populations, the resulting distribution in a country, a region, or the world will be characterized by its largest city, with other cities decreasing in size respective to it, initially at a rapid rate and then more slowly. This results in a few large cities and a much larger number of cities orders of magnitude smaller. For example, a rank 3 city would have one-third the population of a country's largest city, a rank 4 city would have one-fourth the population of the largest city, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of U.S. states' largest cities by population]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;[[List of United States cities by population]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2016}}

When any [[log-linear]] factor is ranked, the ranks follow the [[Lucas numbers]], which consist of the sequentially additive numbers 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, etc. Like the more famous [[Fibonacci sequence]], each number is approximately 1.618 (the [[Golden ratio]]) times the preceding number. For example, the third term in the sequence above, 4, is approximately 1.618&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 4.236; the fourth term, 7, is approximately 1.618&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, or 6.854; the eighth term, 47, is approximately 1.618&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;, or 46.979. With higher values, the figures converge. An [[equiangular spiral]] is sometimes used to visualize such sequences.

== Segmentation ==
[[File:Wikipedia-n-zipf.png|thumb|Wikipedia word frequency plot, showing three segments with distinct behavior.]]

A rank-size (or rank-frequency) distribution is often segmented into ranges. This is frequently done somewhat arbitrarily or due to external factors, particularly for [[market segmentation]], but can also be due to distinct behavior as rank varies.

Most simply and commonly, a distribution may be split in two, termed the '''head''' and '''tail'''. If a distribution is broken into three pieces, the third (middle) piece has several terms, generically '''middle''',&lt;ref name="fishkin"&gt;[https://moz.com/blog/illustrating-the-long-tail Illustrating the Long Tail], Rand Fishkin, November 24th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; also '''belly''',&lt;ref name="young"&gt;[https://gigaom.com/2006/09/04/digg-that-fat-belly/ Digg that Fat Belly!], Robert Young, Sep. 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; '''torso''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/08/03/09/long-tail-guide The Long Tail Keyword Optimization Guide - How to Profit from Long Tail Keywords], August 3, 2009, Tom Demers&lt;/ref&gt; and '''body'''.&lt;ref name="liu"&gt;[http://blogs.technet.com/b/lliu/archive/2005/03/12/394732.aspx The Small Head, the Medium Body, and the Long Tail .. so, where's Microsoft?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117025939/http://blogs.technet.com/b/lliu/archive/2005/03/12/394732.aspx |date=2015-11-17 }}, 12 Mar 2005, Lawrence Liu's Report from the Inside&lt;/ref&gt; These frequently have some adjectives added, most significantly ''[[long tail]]'', also ''fat belly'',&lt;ref name="young" /&gt; ''chunky middle'', etc. In more traditional terms, these may be called ''top-tier'', ''mid-tier'', and ''bottom-tier''.

The relative sizes and weights of these segments (how many ranks in each segment, and what proportion of the total population is in a given segment) qualitatively characterizes a distribution, analogously to the [[skewness]] or [[kurtosis]] of a probability distribution. Namely: is it dominated by a few top members (head-heavy, like profits in the recorded music industry), or is it dominated by many small members (tail-heavy, like internet search queries), or distributed in some other way? Practically, this determines strategy: where should attention be focused?

These distinctions may be made for various reasons. For example, they may arise from differing properties of the population, as in the [[90–9–1 principle]], which posits that in an internet community, 90% of the participants of a community only view content, 9% of the participants edit content, and 1% of the participants actively create new content. As another example, in marketing one may pragmatically consider the head as all members that receive personalized attention, such as personal phone calls; while the tail is everything else, which does not receive personalized attention, for example receiving [[form letter]]s; and the line is simply as far as resources allow, or where it makes business sense to stop.

Purely quantitatively, a conventional way of splitting a distribution into head and tail is to consider the head to be the first ''p'' portion of ranks, which account for &lt;math&gt;1 - p&lt;/math&gt; of the overall population, as in the 80:20 [[Pareto principle]], where the top 20% (head) comprises 80% of the overall population. The exact cutoff depends on the distribution – each distribution has a single such cutoff point—and for power laws can be computed from the [[Pareto index]].

Segments may arise naturally due to actual changes in behavior of the distribution as rank varies. Most common is the [[king effect]], where behavior of the top handful of items does not fit the pattern of the rest, as illustrated at top for country populations, and above for most common words in English Wikipedia. For higher ranks, behavior may change at some point, and be well-modeled by different relations in different regions; on the whole by a [[piecewise function]]. For example, if two different power laws fit better in different regions, one can use a [[broken power law]] for the overall relation; the word frequency in English Wikipedia (above) also demonstrates this.

The [[Yule–Simon distribution]] that results from [[preferential attachment]] (intuitively, "the rich get richer" and "success breeds success") simulates a broken power law and has been shown to "very well capture" word frequency versus rank distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4846.pdf | title=Scaling laws in human speech, decreasing emergence of new words and a generalized model | author=Lin, Ruokuang|author2=Ma, Qianli D. Y.|author3=Bian, Chunhua | year=2014 | arxiv=1412.4846|bibcode=2014arXiv1412.4846L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It originated from trying to explain the population verses rank in different species. It has also been show to fit city population versus rank better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/a110361|title=A Growth Process for Zipf's and Yule's City-Size Laws|first=M F|last=Dacey|date=1 April 1979|publisher=|journal=Environment and Planning A|volume=11|issue=4|pages=361–372|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1068/a110361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rank-size rule ==
The '''rank-size rule''' (or '''law'''), describes the remarkable regularity in many phenomena, including the distribution of city sizes, the sizes of businesses, the sizes of particles (such as sand), the lengths of rivers, the frequencies of word usage, and wealth among individuals.

All are real-world observations that follow [[power law]]s, such as [[Zipf's law]], the [[Yule distribution]], or the [[Pareto distribution]]. If one ranks the population size of cities in a given country or in the entire world and calculates the [[natural logarithm]] of the rank and of the city population, the resulting graph will show a [[log-linear]] pattern.{{dubious|date=March 2013}} This is the rank-size distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.few.eur.nl/vanmarrewijk/geography/zipf/ Zipf's Law, or the Rank-Size Distribution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213211558/http://people.few.eur.nl/vanmarrewijk/geography/zipf/ |date=2007-02-13 }} Steven Brakman, Harry Garretsen, and Charles van Marrewijk&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical rationale===

One study claims that the rank size rule "works" because it is a "shadow" or coincidental measure of the true phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~copyrght/image/monog08/fulltext.pdf The Urban Rank-Size Hierarchy] James W. Fonseca&lt;/ref&gt; The true value of rank size is thus not as an accurate mathematical measure (since other power-law formulas are more accurate, especially at ranks lower than 10) but rather as a handy measure or "rule of thumb" to spot power laws. When presented with a ranking of data, is the third-ranked variable approximately one-third the value of the highest-ranked one? Or, conversely, is the highest-ranked variable approximately ten times the value of the tenth-ranked one? If so, the rank size rule has possibly helped spot another power law relationship.

==Known exceptions to simple rank-size distributions==

While Zipf's law works well in many cases, it tends to not fit the largest cities in many countries; one type of deviation is known as the [[King effect]]. A 2002 study found that Zipf's law was rejected for 53 of 73 countries, far more than would be expected based on random chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0641.pdf|title=Kwok Tong Soo (2002)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that variations of the Pareto exponent are better explained by political variables than by economic geography variables like proxies for economies of scale or transportation costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199280988/01student/zipf/ Zipf's Law, or the Rank-Size Distribution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302005906/http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199280988/01student/zipf/ |date=2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study showed that Zipf's law did not work well for the five largest cities in six countries.&lt;ref&gt;Cuberes, David, The Rise and Decline of Cities, University of Chicago, September 29, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the richer countries, the distribution was flatter than predicted. For instance, in the [[United States]], although its largest city, [[New York City]], has more than twice the population of second-place [[Los Angeles]], the two cities' metropolitan areas (also the two largest in the country) are much closer in population. In metropolitan-area population, New York City is only 1.3 times larger than Los Angeles. In other countries, the largest city would dominate much more than expected. For instance, in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the capital, [[Kinshasa]], is more than eight times larger than the second-largest city, [[Lubumbashi]]. When considering the entire distribution of cities, including the smallest ones, the rank-size rule does not hold. Instead, the distribution is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]]. This follows from [[Gibrat's law]] of proportionate growth.

Because exceptions are so easy to find, the function of the rule for analyzing cities today is to compare the city-systems in different countries.  The rank-size rule is a common standard by which urban primacy is established.  A distribution such as that in the United States or China does not exhibit a pattern of primacy, but countries with a dominant "[[primate city]]" clearly vary from the rank-size rule in the opposite manner.  Therefore, the rule helps to classify national (or regional) city-systems according to the degree of dominance exhibited by the largest city.  Countries with a primate city, for example, have typically had a colonial history that accounts for that city pattern.  If a normal city distribution pattern is expected to follow the rank-size rule (i.e. if the rank-size principle correlates with central place theory), then it suggests that those countries or regions with distributions that do not follow the rule have experienced some conditions that have altered the normal distribution pattern.  For example—the presence of multiple regions within large nations such as China and the United States tends to favor a pattern in which more large cities appear than would be predicted by the rule.  By contrast, small countries that had been connected (e.g. colonially/economically) to much larger areas will exhibit a distribution in which the largest city is much larger than would fit the rule, compared with the other cities—the excessive size of the city theoretically stems from its connection with a larger system rather than the natural hierarchy that central place theory would predict within that one country or region alone.

'''Smith Sound''' is an uninhabited [[Arctic]] sea passage between [[Greenland]] and [[Canada]]'s northernmost island, [[Ellesmere Island]]. It links [[Baffin Bay]] with [[Kane Basin]] and forms part of the [[Nares Strait]].

On the Greenland side of the sound were the now abandoned settlements of [[Etah, Greenland|Etah]] and [[Annoatok]].&lt;ref name="cold"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Gretel Ehrlich|Ehrlich]]|first=Gretel|title=This Cold Heaven: Seven Seasons in Greenland|publisher=Random House|pages=26–7,141,239,348|year=2001|isbn=978-0-679-75852-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The first known visit to the area by Europeans was in 1616 when the ''[[Discovery (1602 ship)|Discovery]]'', captained by [[Robert Bylot]] and piloted by [[William Baffin]], sailed into this region. The sound was originally named ''Sir Thomas Smith's Bay'' after the [[English people|English]] diplomat Sir [[Thomas Smythe]]. By the 1750s it regularly appeared on maps as ''Sir Thomas Smith's Sound'', though no further exploration of the area would be recorded until [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|John Ross]]' 1818 expedition. By this time it had begun to be known simply as ''Smith Sound''.

In 1852 [[Edward Augustus Inglefield]] penetrated a little further than Baffin, establishing a new furthest north in North America.

Retrieved June 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Spatio-spectral scanning yields a series of thin, diagonal slices of the data cube. Figuratively speaking, each acquired image is a 'rainbow-colored' [[spatial map]] of the scene. More precisely, each image represents two spatial dimensions, one of which is wavelength-coded. To acquire the [[spectrum]] of a given object point, scanning is needed.

Spatio-spectral scanning combines some advantages of spatial and spectral scanning: Depending on the context of application, one can choose between a mobile and a stationary platform. Moreover, each image is a spatial map of the scene, facilitating pointing, focusing, and data analysis. This is particularly valuable for irregular or irretrievable scanning movements. Being based on dispersion, spatio-spectral scanning systems yield high spatial and spectral resolution.

&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:SpatiospectralImage.jpg|thumbnail|Spatiospectral image from a basic slit spectroscope in front of a scene illuminated by broadband white light. The camera is reflected in the glass that holds the transmission diffraction grating.]] --&gt;
== Prototypical system ==

A prototypical spatio-spectral scanning system, introduced in June 2014, consists of a basic slit [[spectroscope]] (slit + dispersive element) at some suitable, non-zero distance before a camera. (If the effective camera distance is zero, the system is applicable to spatial scanning). The imaging process is based on spectrally-decoded [[camera obscura]] projections: A series of projections from a continuous array of pinholes (= the slit) is projected onto the dispersive element, each projection contributing a rainbow-colored strip to the recorded two-dimensional image. The field of view in the wavelength-coded spatial dimension asymptotically approaches the dispersion angle of the dispersive element as the camera distance from the dispersive element approaches infinity.&lt;ref name="Grusche"/&gt;
Scanning is achieved by moving the camera transverse to the slit (stationary platform), or by moving the entire system transverse to the slit (mobile platform).
[[File:Spatiospectral scanning with a basic slit spectroscope.jpg|thumb|500px|Schematic of the prototypical setup. Spatiospectral scanning is achieved by moving the camera or the whole system along the direction of dispersion.]]

== Advanced system ==

An advanced spatio-spectral scanning system, proposed in June 2014, consists of a dispersive element before a spatial scanning system. (This allows for easy switching between spatial and spatio-spectral scanning). The imaging process is based on spectral analysis of a strip of a dispersed image of the scene. The field of view in the wavelength-coded spatial dimension equals the dispersion angle of the dispersive element.&lt;ref name="Grusche"/&gt; As in the more basic system, scanning is achieved by transverse movement of the slit or by moving the system relative to the scene. [[File:Spatiospectral scanning Advanced setup.jpg|thumb|500px|Schematic of the advanced setup. The first lens images the object onto the slit plane. The first dispersive element disperses this image. The camera produces an image of the slit plane, the second dispersive element disperses the slit image, thereby creating a rainbow-colored image of the object.]]

{{main|Corfu Channel Incident }}
The [[Corfu Channel Incident]] refers to three separate incidents involving [[Royal Navy]] ships in the Straits of Corfu which took place in 1946, and it is considered an early episode of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Journal of Legal History"&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AJLH/2005/3.html Australian Journal of Legal History] Half Light Between War and Peace: Herbert Vere Evatt, The Rule of International Law, and The Corfu Channel Case&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corfu Incident"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox_gXq2jpdYC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=Royal+Navy+Corfu+Channel&amp;source=web&amp;ots=nbpO3B4_Jz&amp;sig=QUfXd2KWVSL-48YYLxyPxDjXdpc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result |title=Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |chapter=Corfu Channel Incident |first=Bernard A. |last=Cook  |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2001 |isbn=978-0815340577 |page=224| accessdate=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Timesonline"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article721285.ece Times Online] Obituary: Lieutenant-Commander Hugh Knollys Navigator who won a DSC on D-Day and survived when his destroyer hit a mine in the postwar Corfu Channel incident.&lt;/ref&gt; During the first incident, Royal Navy ships came under fire from Albanian fortifications.&lt;ref name="Corfu Incident"/&gt; The second incident involved Royal Navy ships striking [[naval mine|mines]] and the third incident occurred when the Royal Navy conducted [[mine-clearing]] operations in the Corfu Channel, but in Albanian [[territorial waters]],&lt;ref name="Journal of Legal History"/&gt; and [[Albania]] complained about them to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="Corfu Incident"/&gt; This series of incidents led to the [[The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v.

In May 1946 the Albanians fired on two Royal Navy Cruisers and in October 1946 two Royal Navy destroyers were damaged by mines with the loss of 44 men. Britain was awarded damages at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Albania refused to recognise the judgement. In retaliation, Britain refused to permit the release of Albanian gold held since the War by the Tripartite Gold Commission." and "Post-War diplomatic relations were finally established on 29 May 1991"&lt;/ref&gt;

Area codes in [[Nigeria]] are 1 ([[Lagos]], [[Ibadan]] and [[Abuja]]) or 2 digits long. Local phone numbers are between 5 and 7 digits long. The length of a phone number can vary even within area codes. Mobile phone numbers start with 070, 080, 081 or 090 followed by 8 digits

== Calling formats (Using calls to Lagos as example) ==
* '''xxx xxxx'''        - Calls within an area code
* '''01 xxx xxxx'''     - Calls from outside Lagos
* '''+234 1 xxx xxxx''' - Calls from outside [[Nigeria]]
* '''0xxx xxx xxxx'''   - Calls to a mobile number (see below)
* '''042 xxx xxxx'''    - Land line Calls to Enugu

'''Texarkana''' is a city in [[Arkansas]] and the county seat of [[Miller County, Arkansas|Miller County]]. The city is located across the state line from its [[Twin cities|twin city]], [[Texarkana, Texas]]. The city was founded at a railroad intersection on December 8, 1873, and was incorporated in Arkansas on August 10, 1880. Texarkana (together with its Texas counterpart) is the principal city of the [[Texarkana metropolitan area]], which is ranked 274th in terms of population in the United States with 150,098 in 2016 according to the [[United States Census Bureau]].

Located within the [[Ark-La-Tex]] subregion of [[Southwest Arkansas]], Texarkana is located in the [[Piney Woods]], a [[oak-hickory forest]] atop the flat [[Gulf Coastal Plain]].

Outdoors tourism, such as fishing at [[Lake Millwood]], are also important in the region. The [[Texarkana Arkansas School District]] is the largest public school district on the Arkansas side, leading to graduation from [[Arkansas High School]]. The city is home to [[Texarkana College]] (on the Texas side of town), and a branch campus of the [[University of Arkansas Community College at Hope]] (UACCH).

A '''tracking system''' is used for the [[surveillance|observing]] of persons or objects on the move and supplying a [[time series|timely ordered sequence]] of location data for further processing.

== Tracking in virtual space ==
In [[virtual space]] technology, a tracking system is generally a system capable of rendering virtual space to a human observer while tracking the observer's [[coordinates]]. For instance, in dynamic virtual auditory space simulations, a real-time head tracker provides feedback to the central processor, allowing for selection of appropriate head-related transfer functions at the estimated current position of the observer relative to the environment.

== Tracking in real world ==
There are myriads of tracking systems. Some are 'lag time' indicators, that is, the data is collected after an item has passed a point for example a [[bar code]] or choke point or gate. Others are 'real-time' or 'near real-time' like [[Global Positioning System]]s (GPS) depending on how often the data is refreshed. There are bar-code systems which require a person to scan items and [[Automatic identification and data capture|automatic identification]] ([[RFID]] auto-id). For the most part, the tracking worlds are composed of discrete hardware and software systems for different applications. That is, bar-code systems are separate from [[Electronic Product Code]] (EPC) systems, GPS systems are separate from active real time locating systems or [[Real-time locating|RTLS]] for example, a passive RFID system would be used in a warehouse to scan the boxes as they are loaded on a truck - then the truck itself is tracked on a different system using GPS with its own features and software. The major technology “silos” in the supply chain are:

=== Distribution/Warehousing/Manufacturing ===
Indoors assets are tracked repetitively reading e.g. a barcode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clancy|first=Heather|title=California security company uses barcodes to help track assets|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/small-business-matters/california-security-company-uses-barcodes-to-help-track-assets/1493|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  any passive and active [[RFID]] and feeding read data into Work in Progress models (WIP) or Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) or ERP software. The readers required per choke point are meshed auto-ID or hand-held ID applications.

However tracking could also be capable of providing monitoring data without binding to a fixed location by using a cooperative tracking capability, e.g. an [[Real-time locating system|RTLS]].

=== Yard management ===
Outdoors mobile assets of high value are tracked by choke point,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cisco Unveils Wireless Location Solution and New Unified Wireless Network Software Release|url=http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2007/prod_052207.html|publisher=CISCO|accessdate=May 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
802.11, [[Real-time locating|Received Signal Strength Indication]] (RSSI), Time Delay on Arrival (TDOA), active RFID or GPS Yard Management; feeding into either third party yard management software from the provider or to an existing system. Yard Management Systems (YMS) couple location data collected by RFID and GPS systems to help supply chain managers to optimize utilization of yard assets such as trailers and dock doors. YMS systems can use either active or passive RFID tags.

=== Fleet management ===
[[Fleet management]] is applied as a [[GPS tracking|tracking application using GPS]] and composing tracks from subsequent vehicle's positions. Each vehicle to be tracked is equipped with a GPS receiver and relays the obtained coordinates via [[cellular network|cellular]] or [[satellite network]]s to a home station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 tips for selecting a GPS fleet management solution|url=http://phcnews.com/aug_11/gps_feature.php|publisher=Phc News|accessdate=August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130826091614/http://phcnews.com/aug_11/gps_feature.php|archivedate=2013-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fleet management is required by:
* Large fleet operators, (vehicle/railcars/trucking/shipping)
* Forwarding operators (containers, machines, heavy cargo, valuable shippings)
* Operators who have high equipment and/or cargo/product costs
* Operators who have a dynamic workload

=== Attendance management ===
One such use of the [[RFID]] technology is in tracking [[student ID|IDs of students]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hadlock|first=Charles|title=RFID chips let schools track students -- and retain funding -- but some parents object|url=http://dailynightly.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/14/14425733-rfid-chips-let-schools-track-students-and-retain-funding-but-some-parents-object|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=Oct 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using GPS IDs would resolve the decreasing attendance in schools by [[surveillance|monitoring]] the whereabouts of students when they did not attend class (Jensen, 2008).  It is also used to efficiently check attendance. Perks of this tracking system is allowing students to check out library books buy food in the cafeterias (Jensen, 2008).  The GPS IDs also act as a security measure to monitor any unwanted visitors or an emergency locator if a student cannot be found (Jensen, 2008).  In the Spring Independent School District, students have been using for many years in check that students are staying in school during the day.  Since they have instigated the system, attendance has increased thus schooling funding has increased as well (Jensen, 2008).

Recently, debates over the Fourth Amendment have come up. Conservative students wish to keep their [[privacy]] and forbid to wear tracking devices, especially  hackers can break into these systems to find out students’ information.  Since many schools, such as those in the Spring Independent School District, require students to wear the tracking IDs, students argue that it is an immediate violation of their privacy (Jensen, 2008).  Yet, the Fourth Amendment is not violated in these cases since students are not tracked in their homes (Warner, 2007).  Each school’s decision over GPS IDs varies as states develop laws against these IDs in schools and as students protest for their [[privacy rights]].

=== Mobile phone services ===
[[Location-based services]] or LBS is a term that is derived from the [[telematics]] and telecom world. The combination of [[A-GPS]], newer GPS and cellular locating technology is what has enabled the latest “LBS” for handsets and PDAs. Line of sight is not necessarily required for a location fix. This is a significant advantage in certain applications since a GPS signal can still be lost indoors. As such, A-GPS enabled cell phones and PDAs can be located indoors and the handset may be tracked more precisely. This enables non-vehicle centric applications and can bridge the indoor location gap, typically the domain of [[RFID]] and [[Real-time locating system|RTLS]] systems, with an off the shelf cellular device.

Currently, A-GPS enabled handsets are still highly dependent on the LBS carrier system, so handset device choice and application requirements are still not apparent. Enterprise system integrators need the skills and knowledge to correctly choose the pieces that will fit the application and geography.

== Operational requirements ==
Regardless of the tracking technology, for the most part the end-users just want to locate themselves or wish to find points of interest. The reality is that there is no "one size fits all" solution with locating technology for all conditions and applications.

Application of tracking is a substantial basis for [[vehicle tracking]] in fleet management, [[asset management]], individual navigation, social networking, or mobile resource management and more. Company, group or individual interests can benefit from more than one of the offered technologies depending on the context.

=== GPS applications ===
[[GPS]] has global coverage but can be hindered by line-of-sight issues caused by buildings and urban canyons.  RFID is excellent and reliable indoors or in situations where close proximity to tag readers is feasible, but has limited range and still requires  costly readers.  RFID stands for [[Radio-frequency identification|Radio Frequency Identification]]. This technology uses electromagnetic waves to receive the signal from the targeting object to then save the location on a reader that can be looked at through specialized software (Warner, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RFID|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/site/faqs#Anchor-What-363|publisher=RFID Journal LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real-time Locating Systems (RTLS)===
[[Real-time locating system|RTLS]] are enabled by [[Wireless LAN]] systems (according to [[IEEE 802.11]]) or other [[wireless]] systems (according to [[IEEE 802.15]]) with [[multilateration]]. Such equipment is suitable for certain confined areas, such as campuses and office buildings. RTLS require system-level deployments and server functions to be effective.

These wristbands can transmit a signal with an effective range of over two football fields, narrowing down each child's position to within thirty feet.  Furthermore, the system can track the children over a two square mile area surrounding their school.  If a child walks off their path or does not make it to school on time, the centralized system automatically sends an e-mail or text message to the child's parents.  ...  In addition, cars near the children's school are fitted with the same technology, and if a vehicle drives near a child, a voice prompt will alert the driver ...
