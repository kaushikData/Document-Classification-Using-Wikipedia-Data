{{British legislation lists}}
In the United Kingdom an '''Act of Parliament''' is [[primary legislation]] passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="1998-c-42"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/section/21 |title=Human Rights Act 1998 (c. 42) |publisher=National Archives |year=1998 |isbn=0-10-544298-4 |nopp=yes |at=Section 21 (Interpretation)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parliament.uk_new-laws"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/new-laws/ |title=Why are new laws needed? - UK Parliament |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the assertion of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], any such Act is in theory supreme law that cannot be overturned by any body other than Parliament, although it has been recognised though the United Kingdom's membership of the [[European Union]] that Acts or parts of Acts which conflict with [[EU law]] can be disapplied.

An Act of Parliament can be enforced in all four of the [[constituent countries of the United Kingdom|UK constituent countries]] ([[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]); however as a result of [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] the majority of Acts that are now passed by Parliament apply either to England and Wales only, or England only; whilst generally Acts only relating to [[Reserved and excepted matters|constitutional and reserved matters]] now apply to the whole of the [[United Kingdom]].

A draft piece of legislation is called a [[Bill (law)|Bill]]; when this is passed by Parliament and given [[Royal Assent]], it becomes an Act and part of [[statute law]].

== Classification of legislation ==
[[File:Parliamentary archives.jpg|thumb|261px|Scrolls containing Acts of Parliament in the [[Parliamentary Archives]] at Victoria Tower, [[Palace of Westminster]]]]
[[Image:Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg|thumb|150px|right|The [[HM Government]] version of the [[Royal Arms of the United Kingdom]] have appeared on all published copies of Acts passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] since 1953.]]
[[Image:Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|150px|right|This version of the [[Royal Arms of the United Kingdom]] appeared on all published copies of Acts passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] from 1814 until 1953.]]

Acts of Parliament are classified as either "Public General Acts" or "Local and Personal Acts" (also known as "Private Acts").  Bills are also classified as "public", "private", or "hybrid".

=== Public General Acts ===
Public General Acts form the largest category of legislation, in principle affecting the public general law applying to everyone across the entire United Kingdom (or at least to one or more of its constituent countries of [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]], or [[Wales]]).&lt;ref name="rogers2006"&gt;p. 190, ''How Parliament Works'', 6th edition, Robert Rogers and Rhodri Walters, Pearson Longman, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Most Public General Acts proceed through Parliament as a public bill; occasionally, however, a bill is treated as [[#Hybrid bills|hybrid]].

=== Local and Personal Acts (Private Acts) ===
{{Main|Local and personal Acts of Parliament (United Kingdom)}}
Private Acts are either local or personal in their effect, applying to a specifically named locality or legal person in a manner different from all others. Private bills are "usually promoted by organisations, like local authorities or private companies, to give themselves powers beyond, or in conflict with, the general law. Private bills only change the law as it applies to specific individuals or organisations, rather than the general public. Groups or individuals potentially affected by these changes can petition Parliament against the proposed bill and present their objections to committees of MPs and Lords."&lt;ref name="canterbury"&gt;[http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/canterburycitycouncil.html Canterbury City Council Bill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018191959/http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/canterburycitycouncil.html |date=18 October 2008 }}, UK Parliament Bill Tracker&lt;/ref&gt; They include acts to confer powers on certain local authorities, a recent example being the Canterbury City Council Bill, which makes provisions relating to street trading and consumer protection in the city.&lt;ref name="canterbury" /&gt; Private bills can also affect certain companies: the Northern Bank Bill allowed the statutory right of Northern Bank to issue bank notes to be transferred to [[Danske Bank]] which had acquired it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/northernbank.html Northern Bank Bill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018193413/http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/northernbank.html |date=18 October 2008 }}, UK Parliament Bill Tracker&lt;/ref&gt; Other private bills may affect particular companies established by Act of Parliament such as [[Trustee Savings Bank|TSB Bank]] and [[Transas]].

Personal Acts are a sub-category of private Acts, which confer specific rights or duties on a named individual or individuals, for example allowing two persons to marry even though they are within a "prohibited degree of consanguinity or affinity" such as stepfather and stepdaughter.

Private bills, common in the 19th century, are now rare, as new planning legislation introduced in the 1960s removed the need for many of them;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Richard|title=Private Bills in Parliament: House of Commons Background Paper|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06508}}&lt;/ref&gt; only a few, if any, are passed each year.

Parliamentary authorities maintain a list of [http://services.parliament.uk/bills/private.html all private bills before parliament].

=== Hybrid bills ===
Hybrid bills combine elements of both public and private bill. While they propose to make changes to the general law, they also contain provisions applying to specific individuals or bodies. Recent examples are the Crossrail Bill, a hybrid bill to build [[Crossrail|a railway across London from west to east]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/crossrailhybridbill.html Crossrail (Hybrid Bill) Bill], UK Parliament Bill Tracker&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1976 Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, which was a particularly controversial bill that was ruled to be a hybrid bill, forcing the government to withdraw some of its provisions to allow its passage as a public bill. Once passed, hybrid bills are printed as part of the Public General Acts.

Parliamentary authorities maintain a list of [http://www.parliament.uk/business/bills-and-legislation/current-bills/previous-bills/hybrid-bills/ all hybrid bills before parliament].

=== Other types of classification ===

==== Private members' bills ====
{{Main|Private Members' Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom}}
It is important not to confuse private bills with private members' bills, which are public bills intended to effect a general change in the law. The only difference from other public bills is that they are brought forward by a private member (a backbencher) rather than by the government.&lt;ref name="rogersp191"&gt;Rogers p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty private members' bills per session are allowed to be introduced, with the sponsoring private members selected by a ballot of the whole house, and additional bills may be introduced under the [[Ten Minute Rule]].

==== Financial bills ====
Financial bills raise revenue and authorise how money is spent. The best-known such bills are the (normally annual) Finance Bills introduced by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Budget of the United Kingdom|Budget]]. This usually encompasses all the changes to be made to tax law for the year. Its formal description is "a Bill to grant certain duties, to alter other duties, and to amend the law relating to the National Debt and the Public Revenue, and to make further provision in connection with finance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/finance.html Finance Bill 2007–08], UK Parliament Bill Tracker&lt;/ref&gt; Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Bills authorise government spending.&lt;ref name="rogersp193"&gt;Rogers p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Housekeeping bills ====
This type of bill is designed to keep the business of government and public affairs up to date. These bills may not be substantial or controversial in party political terms. Two sub-classes of the housekeeping bill are ''consolidation bills'', which set out existing law in a clearer and more up-to-date form without changing its substance; and the [[Tax law rewrite project|tax law rewrite bills]]{{Fix|text=are there enough of these to constitute a class?}}, which do the same for tax law.&lt;ref name="rogersp193" /&gt;

==== Delegated legislation ====
{{Main|Delegated legislation in the United Kingdom}}
An Act of Parliament will often confer power on the [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen]] in [[Privy Council|Council]], a [[Minister of the Crown|Minister]], or another public body to create delegated legislation, usually by means of a [[Statutory Instrument (UK)|Statutory Instrument]].

== Stages of a bill ==
[[File:Legislative procedure uk.svg|thumb|right|300px|A representation of the legislative procedure.]]
Bills may start their passage in either the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] or [[House of Lords]], although bills which are mainly or entirely financial will start in the Commons. Each bill passes through the following stages:

Pre-legislative Scrutiny: Joint committee of both houses review the bill and vote on amendments that government can accept or reject. Reports are influential in later stages as rejected committee recommendations are revived to be voted on.

[[File:Number-1 (dark green).png|35px]][[#First reading|First Reading]]: No vote occurs. Bill is presented, printed, and in private members' bills, a Second Reading date is set.

[[File:Number-2 (dark green).png|35px]][[#Second reading|Second Reading]]: A debate on the general principles of the bill is followed by a vote.

[[#Committee stage|Committee Stage]]: A committee considers each clause of the bill, and may make amendments.

[[#Report stage|Report Stage]]: An opportunity to amend the bill. The House consider clauses to which amendments have been tabled.

[[File:Number-3 (dark green).png|35px]][[#Third reading|Third Reading]]: A debate on final text as amended.

Passage: The bill is then sent to the other House which may amend it.

{{pad|.2em}}[[File:NYCS-bull-trans-1.svg|25px]] First Reading: ''Same procedures''

{{pad|.2em}}[[File:NYCS-bull-trans-2.svg|25px]] Second Reading: ''Same procedures''

Committee Stage: ''Same procedures''

Report Stage: ''Same procedures''

{{pad|.2em}}[[File:NYCS-bull-trans-3.svg|25px]] Third Reading: Same procedures as in the Commons, but further amendments may also be made.

Passage: The bill is then returned to the original House.

Pre-legislative Scrutiny to consider all amendments.

[[Royal Assent]] for the Bill is then requested; if this is granted, the Bill becomes an Act.

=== Consultation, drafting and pre-legislative scrutiny ===
Although not strictly part of the legislative process, a period of consultation will take place before a bill is drafted. Within government, the Treasury and other departments with an interest will be consulted along with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Outside government, interested parties such as [[trade union]]s, industry bodies and pressure groups will be asked for their views on any proposals. The Cabinet Office Code of Practice specifies a minimum consultation period of twelve weeks. Consultation documents are widely circulated (see for example the [[Home Office]] [http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cons-extreme-porn-3008051/cons-extreme-pornography?view=Binary consultation on extreme pornography]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and the [[Scottish Government]]'s [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/01/23111646/9 consultation on food policy]).

The character of the consultation is shaped by the government's determination to press forward with a particular set of proposals. A government may publish a [[green paper]] outlining various legislative options or a [[white paper]], which is a clear statement of intent.&lt;ref name="rogersp194"&gt;Rogers p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; It is increasingly common for a small number of Government bills to be published in draft before they are presented in Parliament.  These bills are then considered either by the relevant select committee of the House of Commons or by an ad hoc joint committee of both Houses.  This provides an opportunity for the committee to express a view on the bill and propose amendments before it is introduced. Draft bills allow more lengthy scrutiny of potential legislation and have been seen as a response to time pressures which may result in the use of ''programme orders'' to impose a strict timetable on the passage of bills and what is known as 'drafting on the hoof', where the government introduces amendments to its own bills. With increased time for scrutiny backed up with considered evidence, draft bills may present governments with difficulty in getting their way.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers p. 199–202&lt;/ref&gt;

The sponsoring government department will then write to the relevant policy committee of the Cabinet. The proposals are only discussed at a meeting if disagreements arise. Even an uncontroversial proposal may face administrative hurdles. A potential change in the law may have to wait for a more extensive bill in that policy area to be brought forward before it is worthwhile devoting parliamentary time to it. The proposal will then be bundled together with more substantive measures in the same Bill. The Ministerial Committee on the Legislative Programme (LP), including the leaders and government chief whips in both houses, is responsible for the timetable of legislation. This committee decides which house a bill will start in, recommends to the Cabinet which proposals will be in the [[Queen's Speech]], which will be published in draft and how much parliamentary time will be required.&lt;ref name="rogersp194" /&gt;

Following a process of consultation, the sponsoring department will send drafting instructions to parliamentary counsel, expert lawyers working for the government responsible for writing legislation. These instructions will describe what the bill should do but not the detail of how this is achieved. The Parliamentary counsel must draft the legislation clearly to minimise the possibility of legal challenge and to fit the bill in with existing UK, [[European Union]] and delegated legislation. A finished bill must be approved or scrutinised by the sponsoring department and minister, parliamentary counsel and LP.&lt;ref name="rogersp195"&gt;Rogers p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stage is the submission of the bill to the authorities of the House in which it is to start its legislative journey. In the Commons, this is the Clerk of Legislation and the Public Bill Office in the Lords. They will check the following:&lt;ref&gt;Rogers p. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt;

*That the bill complies with the rules of the house
*That everything in the bill is covered by its 'long title' (text describing the purposes of the bill)
*In the Commons, that every provision requiring expenditure or levying taxes is identified and printed in italics
*Whether the [[Royal Prerogative]] is affected
*Whether it conflicts with or duplicates any bill which has already been introduced

After this process, the bill is then ready for introduction.

=== First reading ===
{{See also|Reading (legislature)}}
The first reading is a formality and no debate or vote occurs. A notice that a bill is being presented for its first reading appears on the [[Order Paper]] for that day. The ''European Union (Amendment) Bill'' appeared on the [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmagenda/ob71217.htm Order Paper for 17 December 2007] as follows:

{{cquote|''Notice of Presentation of Bill''

1 EUROPEAN UNION (AMENDMENT) [No debate]

Secretary David Miliband

Bill to make provision in connection with the Treaty of Lisbon Amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty Establishing the European Community, signed at Lisbon on 13th December 2007.

''Formal first reading: no debate or decision.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmagenda/ob71217.htm Order of Business Monday 17 December 2007], UK Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As we can see in this [https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2007-12-17b.636.2&amp;s=%22bills+presented%22 video footage of the first reading], the MP is called by the Speaker at the commencement of public business and brings a 'dummy bill', a sheet of paper with the short and long titles and the names of up to twelve supporters, to the [[Clerk of the House]] at the Table. The Clerk reads out the short title and the Speaker says "Second reading what day?" For all government bills, the response is almost always "tomorrow" (or the next sitting day). A date is also set for private members bills; the decision for scheduling such bills is crucial as they are not given 'government time' to be debated. The bill is recorded in the proceedings as having been read for a first time, having been ordered to be printed and to be read a second time on a particular date.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers p.208&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a Government Bill, Explanatory Notes, which try to explain the effect of the Bill in more simple language, are also usually ordered to be printed. Again, in the case of the ''European Union (Amendment) Bill'' this appeared in [[Hansard]] as follows:

{{cquote|Secretary David Miliband, supported by the Prime Minister, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Secretary Straw, Secretary Jacqui Smith, Secretary Des Browne, Secretary Alan Johnson, Mr. Secretary Alexander, Mr. Secretary Hutton and Mr. Jim Murphy, presented a Bill to make provision in connection with the Treaty of Lisbon Amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty Establishing the European Community, signed at Lisbon on 13th December 2007: And the same was read the First time, ordered to be read a Second time tomorrow, and to be printed. Explanatory notes to be printed [Bill 48].}}

A bill introduced in this way is known as a ''presentation bill''. Bills can also be introduced in the Commons by being brought in from the Lords, being ''brought in by resolution'' (like the Finance Bill) or when an MP gets leave to bring in a ''ten-minute rule bill''.

A Government Bill can be introduced first into either House. Bills which begin in the Lords have '[Lords]' suffixed to its title when in the Lords and '[HL]' when in the Commons.&lt;ref name="rogersp191" /&gt; Bills which deal primarily with taxation or public expenditure begin their passage in the Commons since the financial privileges of that House mean that it has primacy in these matters (see [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]).  Conversely, bills relating to the judicial system, [[Law Commission]] bills and [[consolidation bill]]s begin their passage in the House of Lords which by convention has primacy in these matters.

=== Second reading ===
In the second reading, which in theory is supposed to occur two weekends after the first reading, a debate on the general principles of the bill is followed by a vote. This is the main opportunity to debate the principle of the bill rather than individual clauses. A division at this stage, therefore, represents a direct challenge to the principle of the bill. If the bill is read a second time, it proceeds to the committee stage.

Normally, the Second Reading of a Government bill is approved. A defeat for a Government bill on this Reading usually signifies a major loss. The last time this happened was at the second reading of the Shops Bill for the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1986. The bill, which liberalised controls on Sunday trading, was defeated in the Commons by 14 votes.&lt;ref name="rogersp210"&gt;Rogers p.210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=1986-04-14a.669.3#g694.8|date=14 April 1986|accessdate=27 January 2011|title=Orders of the Day – Business of the House|work=House of Commons Debates|publisher=[[TheyWorkForYou]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Second reading debates on government bills usually take a day, in practice about six hours. Smaller and less controversial bills will receive less time and wholly uncontroversial measures will receive a second reading 'on the nod' with no debate whatsoever.&lt;ref name="rogersp209"&gt;Rogers p.209&lt;/ref&gt; The National Insurance Contributions bill appeared in the Order Papers as follows:

{{cquote|'''Main Business'''

3 NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS BILL: Second Reading. ''[Until 10.00 p.m.]''

'''''Debate may continue until 10.00 p.m.'''''}}

As we can see from [https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2007-12-17b.637.1 video footage of the debate for this bill], second readings of government bills take place on a motion moved (for Government bills) by a minister in the department responsible for the legislation "that the bill now be read a second time". The minister outlines the overall purpose of the Bill and highlights particular parts of the Bill they consider most important. The official Opposition spokesperson responds with his or her views on the Bill. The debate continues with other Opposition parties and backbench MPs giving their opinions on the principles of the Bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/stages/second.cfm Second reading] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531132145/http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/stages/second.cfm |date=31 May 2008 }}, How Parliament Works, UK Parliament&lt;/ref&gt; The minister will eventually bring the debate to a conclusion by saying, of the bill, "I commend it to the House". The Speaker will then ''put the question'' by saying, for example, "The Question is, that the Bill be now read a second time". The Speaker then invites supporters of the bill to say "aye" and then opponents say "no": "All members of that opinion say 'aye' [supporters say 'aye'], contrary 'no' [opponents say 'no']. In what is known as ''collecting the voices'' the Speaker makes a judgement as to the loudest cry. A clear majority, either way, will prompt the response "I think the Ayes/Noes have it" (this can be forced to a division by continued cries either way). If the result is at all in doubt a division will be called and the Speaker will say "Division. Clear the Lobby". This refers not to the division lobbies used for voting but the Members' Lobby beyond the chamber which is cleared by the [[Doorkeeper (Houses of Parliament)|doorkeepers]]. At this point, [[division bell]]s will ring throughout the palace and also in nearby flats, pubs and restaurants whose owners pay to be connected to the system. This allows MPs who may not be in the debate to come and vote on the issue in question.

After two minutes, the Speaker will ''put the Question again'' to assess whether there is still disagreement. He will then name the tellers, whose job it is to count the votes. These will usually be government and opposition whips. In the example we have looked at: "Tellers for the Ayes [[David Watts (politician)|Mr. Dave Watts]] and [[Steve McCabe (politician)|Mr. Steve McCabe]]; tellers for the Noes [[Nick Hurd|Mr. Nick Hurd]] and [[John Baron (politician)|Mr. John Baron]]". If no teller has come forward (or only one) the Speaker declares the result for the other side.

One teller from each side goes to the end of each division lobby and they count MPs as they emerge. Whips are also at the other end of the lobby to try to ensure that their MPs vote with the party line. The names are taken by division clerks and are published in Hansard the next day (see [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071217/debtext/71217-0015.htm#07121722000544 example from Hansard] or with greater clarity [http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2007-12-17&amp;number=33&amp;showall=yes#voters from the Public Whip]). Eight minutes after first calling the division, the Speaker says "lock the doors"; the doorkeepers lock the doors leading into the lobbies and no more MPs can get in to vote. When every member has passed the division clerks and tellers, a ''division slip'' is produced by the Clerks at the Table and is given to one of the tellers on the winning side. The tellers then form up at the Table in front of the Mace facing the Speaker, and the teller with the slip reads the result to the House, for example: "The Ayes to the right, 291. The Noes to the left, 161". The Clerk then takes the slip to the Speaker, who repeats the result and adds "So the Ayes have it, the Ayes have it. Unlock". The doorkeepers then unlock the doors to the division lobbies.&lt;ref name="rogers172"&gt;Rogers p.172&lt;/ref&gt; A division vote concerning a National Insurance Contributions Bill is illustrated from Hansard as follows:

{{cquote|''Question put'', That the Bill be now read a Second time:—

''The House divided'': Ayes 291, Noes 161.

Division No. 033

7.56 pm

AYES [followed by list of MPs and tellers who voted Aye]

NOES [followed by list of MPs and tellers who voted No]

''Question accordingly agreed to.''

''Bill read a Second time.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071217/debtext/71217-0015.htm#07121722000010 National Insurance Contributions Bill], Commons Hansard, 17 Dec 2007 : Column 668&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Divisions on second readings can be on a straight opposition or a vote on a 'reasoned amendment', detailing the reasons the bill's opponents do not want it read a second time, which may be selected by the Speaker. Bills defeated at a second reading cannot progress further or be reintroduced with exactly the same wording in the same session.

=== Procedural orders and resolutions ===
In the case of Government Bills, the House normally passes forthwith (i.e. without debate but almost always with a vote) a Programme Order in the form of a ''programme motion'', setting out the timetable for the committee and remaining stages of the Bill. This takes place immediately after the second reading.&lt;ref name="rogersp210"/&gt; For example:

{{cquote|'''National Insurance Contributions Bill (Programme)'''

''Motion made, and Question put forthwith, pursuant to Standing Order No. 83A (Programme motions),''

:That the following provisions shall apply to the National Insurance Contributions Bill:

:''Committal''

:1. The Bill shall be committed to a Public Bill Committee.

:''Proceedings in Public Bill Committee.''

:2. Proceedings in the Public Bill Committee shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a conclusion on 22nd January 2008.

:3. The Public Bill Committee shall have leave to sit twice on the first day on which it meets.

:''Consideration and Third Reading''

:4. Proceedings on consideration shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a conclusion one hour before the moment of interruption on the day on which those proceedings are commenced.

:5. Proceedings on Third Reading shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a conclusion at the moment of interruption on that day.

:6. Standing Order No. 83B (Programming committees) shall not apply to proceedings on consideration and Third Reading.

:''Other proceedings''

:7. Any other proceedings on the Bill (including any proceedings on consideration of Lords Amendments or on any further messages from the Lords) may be programmed. —[Tony Cunningham.]

''Question agreed to.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071217/debtext/71217-0015.htm#07121722000004 National Insurance Contributions Bill (Programme)], UK Parliament Hansard, 17 Dec 2007 : Column 672&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The House may also pass a separate ''money resolution'', authorising any expenditure arising from the Bill; and/or a ''ways and means resolution'', authorising any new taxes or charges the Bill creates. Bills are not programmed in the House of Lords.&lt;ref name="rogersp210"/&gt;

=== Committee stage ===
This usually takes place in a standing committee in the Commons and on the Floor of the House in the Lords.  In the United Kingdom, the House of Commons utilises the following committees on bills:
* Standing Committee: Despite the name, a standing committee is a committee specifically constituted for a certain bill. Its membership reflects the strengths of the parties in the House. Now known as a Public Bill Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/stand.htm|title=House of Commons - Public Bill Committee Debates|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Special Standing Committee: The committee investigates the issues and principles of the bill before sending it to a regular Standing Committee.  This procedure has been used very rarely in recent years (the Adoption and Children Bill in 2001–2002 is the only recent example); the pre-[[legislative scrutiny]] process (see above) is now preferred. Now also known as a Special Public Bill Committee.
* Select Committee: A specialised committee that normally conducts oversight hearings for a certain Department considers the bill. This procedure has not been used in recent years, with the exception of the quinquennial [[Armed Forces Bill]], which is always referred to a select committee.
* Committee of the Whole House: The whole house sits as a committee in the House of Commons to consider a bill.  Bills usually considered in this way are the principal parts of the annual [[Finance Bill]], bills of first-class constitutional importance (for example, the [[European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018]]) and bills that are so uncontroversial that the committee stage may be dispensed with quickly and easily on the floor of the House, without the need to nominate a committee (some Private Members' Bills are usually dealt with this way each year).  This is also the procedure used in the upper house.
* Grand Committee (House of Lords): This is a recent new procedure used for some bills which is intended to speed up business.  Although it takes place in a separate room, it is technically still a committee of the whole House in that all members can attend and participate.  Procedure is the same as for a Committee in the main Chamber, but there are no votes.

The committee considers each clause of the bill and may make amendments to it.  Significant amendments may be made at committee stage.  In some cases, whole groups of clauses are inserted or removed.  However, almost all the amendments which are agreed to in committee will have been tabled by the Government to correct deficiencies in the bill, to enact changes to policy made since the bill was introduced (or, in some cases, to import material which was not ready when the bill was presented), or to reflect concessions made as a result of earlier debate.

=== Report stage ===
The report state, known formally as "consideration", takes place on the Floor of the House, and is a further opportunity to amend the bill. Unlike committee stage, the House need not consider every clause of the bill, only those to which amendments have been tabled.

=== Third reading ===
In the [[third reading]], a debate on the final text of the bill, as amended. In the Lords, further amendments may be made on third reading, in the Commons, it is usually a short debate followed by a single vote; amendments are not permitted.

=== Passage ===
The bill is then sent to the other House (to the Lords, if it originated in the Commons; to the Commons if it is a Lords bill), which may amend it. The Commons may reject a bill from the Lords outright; the Lords may amend a bill from the Commons but, if they reject it, the Commons may force it through without the Lords' consent in the following Session of Parliament, as is detailed below.  Furthermore, the Lords can neither initiate nor amend money bills, bills dealing exclusively with public expenditure or the raising of revenue. If the other House amends the bill, the bill and amendments are sent back for a further stage.

There is a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that the [[House of Lords]] should not spend more than 60 days over bills sent to them by the Commons.&lt;ref name="historyandpolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-50.html|title=What is to be done with the second chamber?|last=Lawrence|first=Jon|date=January 2007|publisher=History &amp; Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Parliament Acts:''' Under the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]], which do not apply for bills seeking to extend Parliament's length to more than five years, if the Lords reject a bill originated in the House of Commons, then the Commons may pass that bill again in the next session. The bill is then submitted for [[Royal Assent]] even though the Lords did not pass it. Also, if the Lords do not approve of a money bill within thirty days of passage in the Commons, the bill is submitted for Royal Assent nevertheless.

=== Consideration of amendments ===
The House in which the bill originated considers the amendments made in the other House. It may agree to them, amend them, propose other amendments in lieu or reject them. A bill may pass backwards and forwards several times at this stage, as each House amends or rejects changes proposed by the other. If each House insists on disagreeing with the other, the bill is lost under the 'double insistence' rule, unless avoiding action is taken.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200506/jtselect/jtconv/265/265ii.pdf Conventions of the UK Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enacting formula ==
{{See also|List of enacting formulae}}
Each Act commences with one of the following:

'''Standard'''
{{cquote|Be it enacted by the Queen's [King's] most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judge|first=David|title=Political institutions in the United Kingdom|year=2005|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-19-924426-3|pages=44|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
'''For [[money bill]]s'''
{{cquote|We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom in Parliament assembled, towards raising the necessary supplies to defray Your Majesty's public expenses, and making an addition to the public revenue, have freely and voluntarily resolved to give and grant unto Your Majesty the several duties hereinafter mentioned; and do therefore most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the Queen's [King's] most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-}}
'''Under the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]:'''
{{cquote|BE IT ENACTED by The Queen's [King's] most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, in accordance with the provisions of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-}}

==Devolution==
{{Seealso|Act of the Scottish Parliament|Act of the National Assembly for Wales|Act of the Northern Ireland Assembly}}
As a result of [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], and the [[Scottish Parliament]] are also able to create primary legislation for their respective devolved institutions. These devolved [[legislature]]s are able to create legislation regarding all but [[reserved and excepted matters]]. However, Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom remain supreme and can overrule the devolved legislatures. By convention, the Parliament of the United Kingdom does not normally do this without a [[legislative consent motion]].&lt;ref name="1998-c-46"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/section/28 |title=Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46) |year=1998 |isbn=0-10-544698-X |nopp=yes |at=Section 28 (Acts of the Scottish Parliament)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2006-c-32"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/32/contents |title=Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32) |year=2006 |nopp=yes |at=Sections 93 (Assembly Measures) and 107 (Acts of the Assembly)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1998-c-47"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/section/5 |title=Northern Ireland Act 1998 |year=1998 |isbn=0-10-544798-6 |nopp=yes |at=Section 5 (Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sovereignty ==
In the UK there is still a presumption that [[parliamentary sovereignty|Parliament is sovereign]], however it is recognised that "Acts of Parliament are no longer sovereign but can be overruled if they are incompatible with [[European Law]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Holliday, Ian, Gamble, Andrew &amp; Parry, Geraint ''Fundamentals in British politics'' Palgrave Macmillan (1999) p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Within that constraint Acts of Parliament are generally without limit. European Law can overturn such Acts because the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] agreed that UK law should not wish to conflict with European Law. However, if [[Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons|Parliament]] decided to, it could withdraw from the European Union and withdraw from all European law. Parliament has also devolved significant powers to the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and the [[National Assembly for Wales]], it is free to overrule or even abolish those institutions, although this would be unlikely in practice.

British law is also made through [[Statutory Instrument (UK)|Statutory Instruments]] (SIs). These are laws which are made in the name of a government minister, exercising legislative powers delegated to him or her by Act of Parliament (known as the ''parent Act'' or ''enabling Act'').  Some of these must be approved by Parliament before they can become law, others need only be laid before Parliament a certain number of days (usually 40) before coming into force.  They are used because they are much faster and simpler to implement than a full Act of Parliament, and are more easily amended to reflect changing circumstances. Provided they fall within the power delegated by the enabling Act, they have the same force as an Act of Parliament, and much of the UK's law is made in this way.  There are thousands of SIs each year, compared with around 50 Acts. Statutory Instruments are also used to bring Acts into force. Most Acts have sections that come into effect upon Royal Assent, or at a set date thereafter. However, other sections are brought into force using an SI which is titled [''Act Name''] (Commencement No. #) Order. Whilst most legislation has had a maximum of half a dozen Commencement Orders, this is not a strict limit as some Acts have had over 10.

Nothing can bind [[Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons|Parliament]] as a successive parliament can repeal the legislation.

International treaties are not effective in domestic UK law until enforced by an Act of Parliament (e.g. The European Communities Act, which brought the UK into the European Union, the Single European Act which allowed for the creation of the single European [[single market|internal market]] or the Outer Space Act which deals with international treaties on Space).

== Historical records ==
At the end of a medieval [[Parliament of England]] a collection of Acts of a public character was made in the form of a [[Statute Roll]] and given the title of the King’s regnal year; each particular Act forming a section, or a chapter, of the complete Statute, so that, e.g. the [[Vagabonds Act 1383]] became VII Ric. II, c.5. Enrolment of Public Acts on manuscript [[parchment]] "[[Parliament Rolls]]" continued until 1850.&lt;ref name="parliament.uk"&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/lareyne.pdf House of Lords Record Office. The making and keeping of Acts at Westminster]&lt;/ref&gt; The longest Act of Parliament in the form of a scroll is an Act regarding taxation passed in 1821. It is nearly a quarter of a mile (348&amp;nbsp;m) long, and used to take two men a whole day to rewind.&lt;ref name="History of Parliamentary Archives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/cultural-collections/archives/the-records/some-early-acts/|title=Some early Acts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1850, a paper draft was brought into the House in which the Bill started; after the committee stage there the Bill was inscribed on a parchment roll and this parchment was then passed to the other House which could introduce amendments. The original Bill was never re-written and knives were used to scrape away the script from the top surface of the rolls before the new text was added. Since 1850 two copies of each Act were printed on [[vellum]], one for preservation in the House of Lords and the other for transmission to the Public Record Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/cultural-collections/archives/the-records/parchment-to-print/|title=History of Parliamentary Archives|website=Parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1483 annual volumes of Public Acts ("Statute Books") have been printed. In these volumes not only Public Acts but also some Private Acts and various "Local and Personal Acts declared Public" have been included.&lt;ref name="parliament.uk" /&gt;

All UK Acts of Parliament since 1497 are kept in the [[Parliamentary Archives#The House of Lords Record Office|House of Lords Record Office]], including the oldest Act: The "Taking of Apprentices for Worsteads in the County of Norfolk" Act 1497, a reference to the wool [[worsted]] manufacture at [[Worstead]] in [[Norfolk, England]].&lt;ref name="History of Parliamentary Archives" /&gt;

Acts passed before 1 January 1963 are cited by session and chapter. The session of parliament in which the Act was passed is referred to by the regnal year or years of the reigning Monarch and his name, which is usually abbreviated. So, for example, the [[Treason Act 1945]] may be cited:

{| border="1" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse:collapse;"
|- bgcolor="#A4C8FF" valign="top"
! Regnal year or years
! Monarch
! Abbreviation of "chapter"
! Chapter number
|- valign="top"
| 8 &amp; 9
| Geo 6
| c
| 44
|}

All Acts passed on or after 1 January 1963 are cited by calendar year and chapter.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Acts of Parliament Numbering and Citation Act 1962]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/10-11/34/section/1 Section 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

All recent Acts have a [[short title]], or citation (e.g. Local Government Act 2003, National Health Service Act 1974).

Many Acts of a private, personal or local character often have not ever been printed, surviving only in a single manuscript copy in the [[Victoria Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/lareyne.pdf House of Lords Record Office.The making and keeping of Acts at Westminster]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acts in force ==
The UK's [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] publishes most Acts of Parliament in an on-line [[statute law database]]. It is the official revised edition of the primary [[legislation]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. The database shows Acts as amended by subsequent legislation and is the statute book of UK legislation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5263">The '''Alberta Solar Decathlon Project''' was an entry into the [[Solar Decathlon|2009 US DOE Solar Decathlon Competition]] in Washington, DC in October 2009.  The team placed 6th out of the 20 teams present after an exciting week of not very great weather for solar power generation.

The '''Solar Decathlon''' is a high-profile, international competition in which twenty selected teams of university and college students from around the globe compete to design, build and operate the most attractive, practical and [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] [[Solar power|solar-powered]] home.

The event is primarily sponsored by the US [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and includes 10 individual contests for the students and their homes. It takes place biannually in October on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C. The teams' houses and the sponsors' educational exhibits form a solar 'village.' The public, media, industry representatives and invited dignitaries tour the homes and exhibits and learn about solar energy, energy efficiency and home design.

== The team ==
The Alberta Solar Decathlon team is composed of Calgary's four leading post-secondary schools: the University of Calgary, SAIT Polytechnic, Mount Royal College and the Alberta College of Art + Design.

===Student leaders===
*'''Mark Blackwell''': Project Chair; University of Calgary, BCOMM Energy Management Student
*'''Matt Beck''': Project Manager; University of Calgary, Master in Environmental Design Student

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6574">'''Alfred Leo Smith''' (November 6, 1919 - November 19, 2014), also known as '''Al Smith''', was a [[Klamath people|Klamath Nation]] drug and alcohol counselor and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] activist from [[Oregon]].

==Early life==

Smith was born on November 6, 1919 in [[Modoc Point, Oregon]]. He spent his early childhood on the [[Williamson River (Oregon)|Williamson River]].&lt;ref name="klamath-obit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Leo Smith [Obituary]|url=http://klamathtribes.org/news/alfred-leo-smith/|website=Tribal News and Events|publisher=The Klamath Tribes|accessdate=17 July 2016|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age seven, Smith was sent to a nearby Catholic boarding school at the insistence of local Indian agents.  He was ultimately sent to a mix of catholic schools and [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] schools, as far away as [[Beaverton, Oregon]] and [[Stewart Indian School]] in Nevada.  After leaving [[Chemawa Indian School]], he began to live in [[Portland, Oregon]] as an alcoholic panhandler.  He was drafted during [[World War II]] and was sent to federal prison for drinking on duty.  He survived a bout of [[tuberculosis]], and experienced the 1942 death of his sister and 1950 death of his mother.&lt;ref name="unknown-god"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epps|first1=Garrett|title=To an unknown God: religious freedom on trial|date=2001|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0312262396|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/e/epps-unknown.html|accessdate=17 July 2016|chapter=A God I didn't understand}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Congress also voted to [[Klamath Termination Act|terminate the Klamath Nation]] in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=Klamath Termination Act|type=Public Law|number=587|date=13 August 1954|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-68/pdf/STATUTE-68-Pg718.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; striking another blow against Smith.

In 1957, Smith became sober with the help of an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] program, ultimately celebrating 56 years of sobriety.  He also became interested in Native recovery through culturally relevant practices and indigenous spirituality.&lt;ref name="klamath-obit" /&gt;

==Professional life==

Smith began working for the Portland Alcoholism Counseling and Recovery Program, helping alcoholics in a community he knew well.  In 1972, the Bureau of Indian Affairs hired Smith to set up a number of tribal treatment programs across the United States.  He also worked in the Klamath Basin on drug and alcohol recovery issues, where he was able to reconnect with his heritage and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Urofsky|editor1-first=Melvin I.|title=100 Americans making constitutional history a biographical history|date=2004|publisher=CQ Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1452267251|pages=187–9|chapter=Al Smith: the free exercise of religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Al Smith began to work at Sweathouse Lodge, part of the [[Camp Adair#Chicano-Indian Study Center of Oregon|Chicano-Indian Study Center of Oregon]] founded on the site of [[Camp Adair]].  His position as treatment coordinator allowed him to combine AA principles with traditional Native spiritual practices, particularly the daily [[sweat lodge]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epps|first1=Garrett|title=Peyote vs. the state : religious freedom on trial|date=2009|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=0806140267|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Employment Division v. Smith''==
{{main|Employment Division v. Smith}}
In 1982, Smith began working at a nonprofit Drug and Alcohol counseling program in [[Roseburg, Oregon]].  After his colleague Galen Black was fired for ingesting [[peyote]], Smith indignantly attended a ceremony of the [[Native American Church]], declaring "You can't tell me that I can't go to church!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Epps|first1=Garrett|title=Al Smith: Elegy for a Hero of Religious Freedom|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/12/elegy-for-an-american-hero-al-smith-smith-employment-division-supreme-court/383582/|website=Atlantic|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was fired for using peyote as part of the ceremony. At the time, intentional possession of peyote was a crime under Oregon law without an [[affirmative defense]] for religious use. The counselors filed a claim for unemployment compensation with the state, but the claim was denied because the reason for their dismissal was deemed work-related "misconduct." The [[Oregon Court of Appeals]] reversed that ruling, holding that denying them unemployment benefits for their religious use of peyote violated their right to exercise their religion. The [[Oregon Supreme Court]] agreed, although it relied not on the fact that peyote use was a crime but on the fact that the state's justification for withholding the benefits&amp;mdash;preserving the "financial integrity" of the workers' compensation fund&amp;mdash;was outweighed by the burden imposed on the employees' exercise of their religion. The state appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, again arguing that denying the unemployment benefits was proper because possession of peyote was a crime.

The U.S. Supreme Court let stand the Oregon Supreme Court's judgment against the two employees and returned the case to the Oregon courts to determine whether or not sacramental use of illegal drugs violated Oregon's state drug laws (485 U.S. 660 (1988)).  Writing for the majority, [[Antonin Scalia]] declared that the free exercise of religion did not protect minority religions from "neutral, generally applicable laws."  Scalia believed that "...[l]eaving accommodation to the political process will place at a relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in, but that unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be preferred to a system in which each conscience is a law unto itself or in which judges weigh the social importance of all laws against the centrality of all religious beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scalia|first1=Antonin|title=Employment Division v.

The '''Australian Labor Party split of 1931''' was caused by severe divisions within the [[Australian Labor Party]] over their economic response to the [[Great Depression in Australia]]. Amidst intense disagreement between economically conservative and radical elements of the party, two senior ministers in the [[James Scullin|Scullin]] Labor government, [[Joseph Lyons]] and [[James Fenton (Australian politician)|James Fenton]], resigned from Cabinet in January 1931. Lyons, Fenton and their supporters would subsequently merge with the conservative opposition [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] to form the new [[United Australia Party]], led by Lyons with the last Nationalist leader, [[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]], as his deputy.&lt;ref name="scullinpm"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/scullin/in-office.aspx | title=James Scullin: In office | publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] | work=Australia's Prime Ministers | accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1931, the Labor Party split on the left as well, when [[Eddie Ward]], a supporter of radical anti-austerity [[Premier of New South Wales]] [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], won a by-election, and was refused entry to the Labor caucus, resulting in six Lang supporters forming a [[Lang Labor]] party on the crossbench. In November, the United Australia Party and Lang Labor succeeded in defeating the Scullin government, resulting in the [[Australian federal election, 1931|1931 federal election]] in December. The election resulted in a landslide victory for the United Australia Party and the election of Lyons as [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="scullinpm" /&gt;

While Lang Labor would eventually be largely reabsorbed into the Labor Party, the United Australia Party continued to be the main conservative force in Australia until replaced by the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="scullinpm" /&gt;

A '''blasphemy law''' is a [[law]] prohibiting [[blasphemy]], where blasphemy is the act of insulting or showing contempt or lack of [[Reverence (attitude)|reverence]] to a [[deity]], or [[sacred]] things, or toward something considered sacred or [[inviolable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On blasphemy|last = Miriam Díez Bosch and Jordi Sànchez Torrents|publisher = Blanquerna Observatory on Media, Religion and Culture|year = 2015|isbn = 978-84-941193-3-0|location = Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/blasphemy |title=Blasphemy |publisher=Random House Dictionary |accessdate=12 January 2015|quote=Quote: impious utterance or action concerning God or sacred things.; the crime of assuming to oneself the rights or qualities of God.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blasphemy Blasphemy] Merriam Webster (July 2013); 1. great disrespect shown to God or to something holy&lt;br&gt;2. irreverence toward something considered sacred or inviolable&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Blasphemies'', in Webster's New World College Dictionary, 4th Ed,&lt;br&gt;1. profane or contemptuous speech, writing, or action concerning God or anything held as divine.&lt;br&gt;2. any remark or action held to be irreverent or disrespectful&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pew Research Center]], about a quarter of the world's countries and territories (26%) had anti-blasphemy laws or policies as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/29/which-countries-still-outlaw-apostasy-and-blasphemy/ |title=Which countries still outlaw apostasy and blasphemy? |author=Angelina E. Theodorou |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=29 July 2016 |accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states, blasphemy laws are used to protect the religious beliefs of a majority, while in other countries, they serve to offer protection of the religious beliefs of minorities.&lt;ref name=IceNews/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scolnicov2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scolnicov|first=Anat|title=The Right to Religious Freedom in International Law: Between Group Rights and Individual Rights|date=18 October 2010|publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=9781136907050|page=261|quote=A different argument for the retention of the offence of blasphemy (and for its extension to the protection of all religions in the UK [the offence protected only the majority religion]) has been offered by Parekh: a majority religion does not need the protection offered by an offence of blasphemy, but minority religions do because of their vulnerability in the face of the majority.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Copenhagen Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cphpost.dk/news14/national-news14/danes-overwhelmingly-support-their-own-blasphemy-law.html|title=Danes overwhelmingly support their own blasphemy law|date=21 September 2012|publisher=[[The Copenhagen Post]]|language=English|accessdate=17 May 2016|quote=Denmark's own blasphemy law makes it an offence to "mock legal religions and faiths in Denmark", and according to a study carried out on behalf of the liberal think-tank CEPOS, 66 percent of the 1,000 Danes questioned answered that the law should not be repealed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to prohibitions against blasphemy or [[blasphemous libel]], blasphemy laws include all laws which give redress to those insulted on account of their religion. These blasphemy laws may forbid: the vilification of religion and religious groups, defamation of religion and its practitioners, denigration of religion and its followers, offending religious feelings, or the contempt of religion. In some jurisdictions, blasphemy laws include [[hate speech]] laws that extend beyond prohibiting the imminent incitement of hatred and violence. Some blasphemy laws, such as those formerly existing in [[Denmark]], do not criminalize "speech that expresses critique," but rather, "sanctions speech that insults."&lt;ref name="HareWeinstein2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hare|first1=Ivan|last2=Weinstein|first2=James|title=Extreme Speech and Democracy|date=18 November 2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780199601790|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 20 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] obliges countries to adopt legislative measures against "any advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence."&lt;ref name="Hashemi2008"/&gt; However, they also note that such protections must be carefully circumscribed, and do not support prohibition of blasphemy per se.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/GC34.pdf|title=General comment No. 34.

== By country ==
=== Predominantly Christian-majority countries ===
In a number of [[Christian state]]s, blasphemy laws may criminalize abusive or scurrilous speech about [[Christianity]], and often times, other religions and their adherents, as such offenses "have the tendency to lead to a breach of peace".&lt;ref name="Hashemi2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hashemi|first=Kamran|title=Religious Legal Traditions, International Human Rights Law and Muslim States|year=2008|publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]]|language=English |isbn=9789004165557|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia ====
{{Main|Blasphemy law in Australia}}
Emerging as a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] colony in the 1780s, [[Australia]] received [[English common law]], including the [[Blasphemy Act 1697]]. The first colonial laws were the Blasphemous and Seditious Libels Act 1827 for [[New South Wales]] (repealed in 1898), and legislation that governor [[Arthur Phillip]] enacted in [[Van Diemen's Land]] in the same year that regulated printing and publishing and prohibited 'blasphemous and seditious libels' as part of a law to maintain public order.&lt;ref name="Temperman"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Temperman |first1=Jeroen |last2=Koltay |first2=András |date=2017 |title=Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression: Comparative, Theoretical and Historical Reflections after the Charlie Hebdo Massacre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AkY3DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA513 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=512–514 |isbn=9781108267991 |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last attempted prosecution for blasphemy by the Crown occurred in the [[State of Victoria]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Australia abolished and repealed all blasphemy laws at the federal level with the Australia [[Criminal Code Act 1995]], but blasphemy laws remain in some [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]].&lt;ref name="Temperman"/&gt; The states, territories, and the Commonwealth of Australia are not uniform in their treatment of blasphemy. Blasphemy is an offense in some jurisdictions, including New South Wales (section 49 of the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW)), Victoria and [[South Australia]],&lt;ref name="Temperman"/&gt; but is not in others. The present legal situation regarding blasphemy in the [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[Western Australia]] and [[Queensland]] is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Temperman &amp; Koltay, p. 518.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Austria ====
In [[Austria]], a section of the penal code relates to blasphemy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strafgesetzbuch|url=https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Dokumentnummer=NOR12029737|website=Legal Information System of the Republic of Austria|publisher=Austrian Federal Chancellery|accessdate=13 October 2015|date=1975|quote=§ 188 Vilification of Religious Teachings: Anyone who publicly disparages a person or thing that is the object of worship of a domestic church or religious society, or a doctrine, [or other] behavior is likely to attract legitimate offense shall be punished... § 189 Disturbance of Religious Practice: (1) Whoever prevents by force or threat of violence, the law permitted such service or individual acts of worship in a church or religious community existing domestic or interfere, shall be punished with imprisonment... (2) Whoever [commits in a Church or religious place] mischief that is likely to attract legitimate offense shall be punished...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* § 188 : Vilification of Religious Teachings

==== Brazil ====
Art. 208 of the penal code states that "publicly vilifying an act or object of religious worship" is a crime punishable with one month to one year of prison, or fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Canada ====
{{Main|Blasphemous libel}}
{{See also|Hate speech laws in Canada}}
[[Blasphemous libel]] is a crime in Canada under section 296 of the Criminal Code R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46. Subsection (1) reads:
: "Every one who publishes a blasphemous libel is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years".
Subsection (3) reads: 
: "No person shall be convicted of an offence under this section for expressing in good faith and in decent language, or attempting to establish by argument used in good faith and conveyed in decent language, an opinion on a religious subject".
Over the summer of 2016, a petition to parliament asking that the blasphemous libel law be repealed was circulated by several Canadian humanist groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://centreforinquiry.ca/parliamentary-e-petition-opposing-canadas-blasphemy-law/ Petition to Parliament to repeal Canada's blasphemous libel law]&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was presented to the Government in December 2016. It responded in January 2017, stating that "blasphemous libel, along with numerous other provisions of the Criminal Code, are presently under review by the Minister [of Justice] and her officials".&lt;ref&gt;Petition e-382 - House of Commons E-petitions online service, as accessed 11 February 2017&lt;!-- e-petition links get blocked by Wikipedia's spam filter --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://parl.gc.ca/Content/HOC/ePetitions/Responses/421/e-382/421-01047_JUS_E.pdf Response to Petition No. 421-01047] - House of Commons of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 June 2017 Bill C-51, an Act to Amend the Criminal Code was introduced in the House of Commons by Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould. The act would repeal section 296 of the Criminal Code relating to blasphemous libel, as well as various other provisions of the Criminal Code which have been ruled or may be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-51/first-reading/ Bill C-51] | accessdate = 6 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Denmark]], Paragraph 140 of the penal code was about blasphemy. Since 1866, this law has only led to two convictions, in 1938 and in 1946. A further charge was brought to court in 1971, but led to acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religion.dk/religion-og-politik/bag-om-blasfemiparagraffen|title=Bag om blasfemiparagraffen|date=21 May 2014|publisher=[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]|language=Danish|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 a man was charged with blasphemy for posting a video of himself burning the [[Quran]] on [[Facebook|social media]] under the parole ''Yes to freedom - no to Islam''.&lt;ref name="jp22.02.2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=En 42-årig mand er blevet tiltalt for blasfemi ved at afbrænde koranen|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/politiretsvaesen/ECE9385281/en-42aarig-mand-er-blevet-tiltalt-for-blasfemi-ved-at-afbraende-koranen/|accessdate=9 March 2017|publisher=[[Jyllands-Posten]]|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/23/europe/denmark-quran-blasphemy-trnd/ |title=Danish man charged with blasphemy for burning Quran |publisher=CNN |date=23 February 2017 |accessdate= 24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related hate speech paragraph (266b) is also used, albeit more frequently.

Speaking about the report, religious expert Tim Jensen from the University of Southern Denmark said, "Danes may see the blasphemy law as helping integration because it promotes the acceptance of a multicultural and multi-faith society.

==== Finland ====
In [[Finland]], section 10 of chapter 17 of the [[Criminal Code of Finland|Criminal Code]] relate to blasphemy. The section is titled "Breach of the sanctity of religion", but the law text explicitly mentions "publicly blaspheming against God".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001 The Criminal Code of Finland] (in Finnish), [http://www.finlex.fi/ Finlex]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf An unofficial translation of the Criminal Code of Finland] (there is no official translation), [http://www.finlex.fi/ Finlex]&lt;/ref&gt; Unsuccessful attempts were made to rescind the section in 1914, 1917, 1965, 1970, and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uskonnonvapaus.fi/artikkelit/uskontorikokset.html|title=Uskontorikoslakien historia - uskonnonvapaus.fi|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer [[Hannu Salama]] was convicted of blasphemy for his 1964 novel ''Juhannustanssit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yle.fi/elavaarkisto/?s=s&amp;g=4&amp;ag=23&amp;t=77 | title=Hannu Salama – kirjallisuuspalkittu jumalanpilkkaaja | work=Ylen Elävä arkisto | language = Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 Harro Koskinen was prosecuted and fined for works including his painting ''Pig Messiah'', a crucified pig; the works were later displayed in museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yle.fi/elavaarkisto/artikkelit/sikamaalari_harro_koskinen_15941.html#media=15943 |title=Sikamaalari Harro Koskinen |language = Finnish| work=Ylen Elävä arkisto }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Church And State- committee came to a conclusion in 1977 that blasphemy should be removed from the Criminal Code. They suggested that instead of blasphemy the law should be against harassing people's right to believe. Since 1999 the section 10 of chapter 17 of the Criminal Code has been as the Church And State -committee suggested.

[[Jussi Halla-aho]], who later became a Member of the [[Parliament of Finland]], was fined for making connections between pedophilia and Islam in his 2008 blog text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/2009/09/halla-aholle_tuomio_uskonrauhan_rikkomisesta_986648.html | title=Halla-aholle tuomio uskonrauhan rikkomisesta | date=8 September 2009 | language= Finnish| work=Yle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====
The definition of "blasphemy" was introduced into French law in the 13th century (after great debate among the French Moralists), based on the definition given by [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]]: a sin of language, "a failure to declare one's faith", thus representing an attack on the purity of religion. This justified punishment by law, which became extreme during the reign of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]]. Later canonized by the Catholic church as Saint Louis, he became obsessed in his fight against heretics, Jews and Muslims, and set the punishment for blasphemy to mutilation of the tongue and lips.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Bobineau, "Retour de l'ordre religieux ou signe de bonne santé de notre pluralisme laïc ? " [archive], Le Monde.fr, 8 décembre 2011 (consulté le 15 janvier 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2018}} Louis IX passed the law against blasphemy in 1254 after he returned home from the [[Seventh Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;Temperman &amp; Koltay, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the beginning of the [[French Revolution]], according to the articles 10 and 11 of the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] (Déclaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen)&lt;ref&gt;Temperman &amp; Koltay, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; the notion of blasphemy was eliminated from French law in 1791, but it continued to prohibit the use of abusive language or disturbance of the peace. Sacrilege actions towards the cultual objects [[Anti-Sacrilege Act|became a crime]] in 1825 during the [[Bourbon Restoration]] (1814), to be revoked under the less conservative [[Louis Philippe]] in 1830, and "religious insult" ("''outrage à la morale religieuse'' ") was introduced by the Act of 17 May 1819. It was definitively removed from French law by the [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070722&amp;dateTexte=vig Act of 29 July 1881] which instituted freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Temperman &amp; Koltay, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018}}, and since 1972 with the ratification of the European Convention of Human Rights, French law proscribed hate or violence against, and slander or libel against, people due to their membership of a religious group, nationality, ethnic group, race, sexual orientation or handicap (Art.23, 24, 32). The Act of 1881 protects individuals and groups of individuals against defamation or insult ("''injure'' " and "''outrage'' " for foreign ambassadors), but not the divinities ({{fr}} [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?oldAction=rechExpJuriJudi&amp;idTexte=JURITEXT000006935227&amp;fastReqId=2026782259&amp;fastPos=1 like Jesus Christ]) and their doctrines as for blasphemy.

The [[Alsace-Moselle]] region was a specific exception, as it was annexed to Germany from 1871 to 1918 and therefore when the "religious insult" law was repealed in the rest of France. The German penal code replaced the pre-1871 French law but the [[local law in Alsace-Moselle]] retained in some few elements in 1919, like the religious legislation and the articles 166 and 167, when it reverted to France. This included a ban of "blasphemy " (as translated from the German word "lästerung ") against Christianity and Judaism, without mention of Islam which at the time had very few followers in Alsace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/charlie-hebdo-has-controversial-history-of-offending-radical-islam-1.2892171 Charlie Hebdo has controversial history], CBC News, 8 Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Since the dispositions of article 166 were not among those finally transposed officially in French law since the Act of 1 June 1924, whose article 1 and 1 s) introduced as well in Alsace-Moselle the generally referred to Act of 29 July 1881,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6476105c/f2.item Act of 1 June 1924] "Mettant en vigueur la législation civile française dans les départements du Bas-Rhin, du Haut-Rhin et de la Moselle ", on gallica.bnf.fr.&lt;/ref&gt; then translated into French in 2013 by the decrees n•2013-395 and particularly n•2013-776,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000027904809&amp;categorieLien=id Decree n°2013-776 of 27 August 2013 about Alsace-Moselle laws and regulations, as retained in 1924, without their later modifications] on legifrance.gouv.fr.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.haut-rhin.gouv.fr/content/download/11747/81770/file/recueil40.pdf "Arrêté n°2013241-0001 portant publication de la traduction de lois et règlements locaux maintenus en vigueur par les lois du 1er juin 1924 dans les départements du Bas-Rhin, du Haut-Rhin et de la Moselle "] Special "Recueil des Actes Administratifs "n°40 of the Haut-Rhin departement, August 2013, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the Act of 24 July 1921 and the Decree of 15 May 1922, German remained, until 2012, the official judiciary language in the maintained local law matters, as was confirmed by article 12 of the Act of 1 June 1924 which considered the French version for "documentary" purposes only.&lt;/ref&gt; they received no application since then, as the appeal court of [[Colmar]] refused to apply this article in 1954, contrary to article 167 (obstacle to the exercise of worship).

==== Germany ====
In Germany, religious defamation is covered by Article 166 of the [[Strafgesetzbuch]], the German criminal law. If a deed is capable of disturbing the public peace, defamation is actionable. The article reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__166.html|title=StGB - Einzelnorm|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::'''§ 166 [[Defamation]] of religious denominations, religious societies and [[World view]] associations'''
::(1) Whoever publicly or by dissemination of writings (§ 11 par. 3) defames, in a manner suitable to disturb the public peace, the substance of the religious or world view conviction of others, shall be fined or imprisoned for up to three years.
::(2) Whoever publicly or by dissemination of writings (§ 11 par. 3) defames, in a manner suitable to disturb the public peace, a [[Church body|church]] established in Germany or other religious society or world view association, or their institutions or [[Norm (sociology)|customs]], shall be punished likewise.

In 2006, the application of this article received much media attention when a Manfred van H.

==== Greece ====
Articles 198, 199, and 201 of the Greek Penal Code create offences which involve blasphemy. Article 198 "Malicious Blasphemy" provides:

:''1. One who publicly and maliciously and by any means blasphemes God shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than two years''.

:''2. Except for cases under paragraph 1, one who by blasphemy publicly manifests a lack of respect for the divinity shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than three months''.&lt;ref name="COE090add2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2008/CDL(2008)090add2-e.asp |title=Analysis of the domestic law concerning blasphemy, religious insults and inciting religious hatred |accessdate=17 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401145655/http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2008/CDL%282008%29090add2-e.asp |archivedate=1 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 199 "Blasphemy Concerning Religions" states: "One who publicly and maliciously and by any means blasphemes the Greek Orthodox Church or any other religion tolerable in Greece shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than two years".&lt;ref name = "COE090add2"/&gt;

Article 201 provides: "One who willfully removes a corpse, parts of a corpse or the ashes of the dead from those who have lawful custody thereof or one who commits an offense with respect to a corpse or acts blasphemously and improperly toward a grave, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than two years".&lt;ref name = "COE090add2"/&gt;

Greece has not used its laws about blasphemy to protect any religion other than the Greek Orthodox Church, which is the state church of Greece.&lt;ref name = "COE090add2"/&gt;
In December 2003, Greece prosecuted for blasphemy [[Gerhard Haderer]], an Austrian, along with his Greek publisher and four booksellers. Haderer is the author of an illustrated, humorous book entitled ''The Life of Jesus''. The prosecutor contended that the book's depiction of Jesus as a [[hippie]] was blasphemous. On 13 April 2005, the Court of Appeal of Athens, reversed the judgment of the Court of First Instance, and acquitted Haderer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/greece/2005/04/25/austrian_author_acquitted_on_appeal/|title=Austrian author acquitted on appeal in blasphemy case - IFEX|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greece complements its laws against blasphemy with laws against "religious insult". The laws forbid the creation, display or trade in work that "insults public sentiment" or that "offends people's religious sentiments". The right to redress for a religious insult has so far been restricted to Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caslon.com.au/blasphemyprofile9.htm "Blasphemy and Sacrilege: European Law and Cases"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713032058/http://www.caslon.com.au/blasphemyprofile9.htm |date=13 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2008/CDL-AD(2008)026-e.asp]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401150123/http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2008/CDL-AD%282008%29026-e.asp |date=1 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Icelandic blasphemy law was repealed on 2 July 2015, after a strong push by the [[Icelandic Pirate Party]] and a number of associations including [[Icelandic Ethical Humanist Association]] (Siðmennt), the bishop of Iceland, the Icelandic priesthood, the Association of Publishers, PEN Iceland, IMMI (The International Modern Media Institute) an Icelandic based international organization of information and freedom of expression, and an atheist group called Vantrú.&lt;ref name="Siðmennt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sidmennt.is/2015/07/02/blasphemy-law-abolished-in-iceland-2/ |title=Blasphemy Law Abolished in Iceland! |date=2 July 2015| publisher=[[Icelandic Ethical Humanist Association]] |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, blasphemy was forbidden with a fine or prison sentence up to three months (Article 125 of the [[General Penal Code (Iceland)|General Penal Code of Iceland]], enacted on 12 February 1940).&lt;ref name="Icelandic Code"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.althingi.is/lagas/133b/1940019.html |title=Almenn hegningarlög (General Criminal Code) |language=is |publisher=Parliament of Iceland |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution also mentions the state religion and religion in general.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=What does it mention?}}

==== Ireland ====
{{Main|Blasphemy law in the Republic of Ireland}}
[[File:Stephen Fry June 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Stephen Fry]] in June 2016]]
In Ireland, blasphemy against any form of religion is prohibited by the 2009 Defamation Act.&lt;ref name=oct28&gt;https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1134&amp;context=jil&lt;/ref&gt; Blasphemy against Christianity was prohibited by the constitution and carried a maximum fine of €25,000; however, the offence of blasphemous libel, last prosecuted in 1855 in connection to an alleged [[Bible]]-burning,&lt;ref name="RTEvote"/&gt; was ruled in 1999 to be incompatible with the Constitution's guarantee of religious equality. A controversial law was passed on 9&amp;nbsp;July 2009 and went into effect on 1&amp;nbsp;January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Henry MacDonald, [http://www.theage.com.au/world/irish-to-vote-on-lifting-blasphemy-ban-20100316-qcif.html "Irish to vote on repealing blasphemy ban"], ''Melbourne Age'', 17 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibits publishing or uttering "matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion".&lt;ref name=oct28 /&gt;

The [[Irish Constitutional Convention]] in 2013 recommended, and the Government endorsed, the repeal of the constitutional prohibition on blasphemy (Article 40.6.1.i.), but the Taoiseach indicated to postpone the issue.&lt;ref name="Irish Times"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/blasphemy-law-needs-to-be-repealed-1.2068942 |title=Blasphemy law needs to be repealed |work=[[Irish Times]] |date=17 January 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestions in 2014 to hold a referendum on the matter have so far not materialized.&lt;ref&gt;Temperman &amp; Koltay, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Calls for repeal resurged after the January 2015 [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]].&lt;ref name="Irish Times"/&gt;

The law had not been invoked until in February 2015 English comedian [[Stephen Fry]], when asked during an [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] programme what he might say to God at the gates of heaven, responded, without specifying any religion,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'd say: 'Bone cancer in children, what's that about? How dare you? How dare you create a world in which there is such misery that is not our fault? It's not right. It's utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?' That's what I'd say (...) the god who created this universe, if it was created by a god, is quite clearly a maniac, an utter maniac, totally selfish (...)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/stephen-fry-anti-god-rant |title=What Would Actor Stephen Fry Say If He Met God?

An allegation of blasphemy was made to [[Garda Síochána|police]] at the time, and in 2017 police contacted Fry to inform him that the incident was being investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39830447 |title=Stephen Fry faces blasphemy probe after God comments|website=BBC News|date=6 May 2017|author= |accessdate= 6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/may/07/stephen-fry-investigated-by-irish-police-for-alleged-blasphemy |title=Stephen Fry investigated by Irish police for alleged blasphemy|website=The Guardian|date=7 May 2017|author= |accessdate= 8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the investigation caused a big stir, but a few days later it was reported that the police, the [[Garda Síochána]], had dropped the case as there was no injured party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39857543 |title=Irish police drop Stephen Fry blasphemy probe|website= BBC News |date=9 May 2017  |author= |accessdate= 9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Garda Síochána could not find enough people outraged over the actor's anti-God remarks. One individual complaint alone cannot result in a prosecution under the legislation and only one viewer made a formal complaint against Fry's comments.

In June 2018, the new Irish government approved of a referendum on removing the offense from the Constitution, which later took place on October 26, 2018. During the referendum, voters abolished the Constitutional blasphemy ban by a margin of 64.85% to 35.15%.&lt;ref name="RTEvote"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2018/1027/1007130-blasphemy-referendum/ |title=Ireland votes to remove blasphemy from Constitution by 64.85% to 35.15% |work=RTÉ |date=28 October 2018 |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ban is still covered by the 2009 Defamation Act, for which offenders can face a fine of up to €25,000 for blasphemy,&lt;ref name=2009blas&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.local10.com/news/international/ireland-awaits-result-in-referendum-on-repealing-blasphemy-ban |title=Ireland awaits result in referendum on repealing blasphemy ban |author=Peter Taggart |work=[[Local 10]] |publisher=[[WPLG]] |date=27 October 2018 |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minister of Justice and Equality [[Charles Flanagan]] will now also move to repeal sections 36 and 37 of the Defamation Act 2009.&lt;ref name="RTEvote"/&gt;

==== Malta ====
Instead of a law against blasphemy, [[Malta]] had laws against the vilification of religion, and against [[Morality|immorality]]. Enacted in 1933, Article 163 of Malta's Criminal Code prohibited "vilification of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Religion",&lt;ref name="Maltese Code"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&amp;itemid=8574 |title=Title IV: Of crimes against the religious sentiment.

Article 163: Vilification of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Religion. |work=Criminal Code of Malta |publisher=Court Services |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is Malta's state religion. Vilification of Malta's religion made the vilifier liable to imprisonment for a term from one to six months. By Article 164, vilification of any cult "tolerated by law" made the vilifier liable to imprisonment for a term from one to three months. Article 338(bb) imposes liability upon anyone who, "even though in a state of intoxication, publicly utters any obscene or indecent words, or makes obscene acts or gestures, or in any other manner not otherwise provided for in this Code, offends against public morality, propriety or decency". Article 342 provides:
:In respect of the contravention under article 338(bb), where the act consists in uttering blasphemous words or expressions, the minimum punishment to be awarded shall in no case be less than a fine (''amenda'') of eleven euro and sixty-five cents (11.65) and the maximum punishment may be imprisonment for a term of three months ...
In 2008, criminal procedures were initiated against 621 people for blaspheming in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20091014/local/cigarette-butts|title=Criminal proceedings for blaspheming and littering with cigarette butts |publisher=Allied Newspapers Ltd |accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy ====
In [[Italy]], under the article 724 of the Penal Code, blasphemy in public is considered as an "administrative offense" and punished with a fine ranging from €51 to €309.
First introduced in 1930 under [[Mussolini]], blasphemy was decriminalized as per art.57, d.lgs. n.507 of 30 December 1999.
As per [[Corte Costituzionale]] sentence n.440 of 18 October 1995, the law punishes only blasphemy against the "Deity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brocardi.it/codice-penale/libro-terzo/titolo-i/capo-ii/sezione-i/art724.html |title=Art. 724 codice penale - Bestemmia e manifestazioni oltraggiose verso i defunti |publisher=Brocardi.it |date= |accessdate=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 404 of the Penal Code also punishes public offenses to religion, and has been invoked against artists using religious imagery in satirical art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/410323/hogre-jesus-chared-with-public-offense-italy/|title="Artist Charged with Public Offense to Religion in Italy Over Image of Aroused Jesus"|last=Ro|first=Christine|date=7 November 2017|website=Hyperallergic|access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gerard Kornelis van het Reve (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Gerard Reve]] kisses a donkey (1969). Found guilty of 'blasphemy' in 1966 for describing a sex scene with God-turned-donkey in a novel, he successfully appealed in 1968.]]
With the introduction of the [[Wetboek van Strafrecht|Dutch Criminal Code]] of 1881, in force since 1886, the [[Netherlands]] obtained its first law against blasphemy. The Minister of Justice argued that, although God would be perfectly capable of protecting his own rights, the Dutch legislator had to 'protect the rights of society'.&lt;ref name="Temperman620"&gt;Temperman &amp; Koltay, p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, a bill was proposed to tighten the 1886 law. Parliament was divided between confessional and non-confessional parties, but also between different confessional parties on the question whether the purpose of the bill was protecting God or religion, or religious people. The bill passed on 1 June 1932 with 49 against 44 votes in the House, 28 against 18 votes in the Senate, and was adopted on 4 November 1932.&lt;ref name="Temperman623"&gt;Temperman &amp; Koltay, p. 623.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 147 punished (by up to three months in jail or a fine of the second category (i.e. up to €3,800&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/EersteBoek/TitelII/Artikel23|title=Penal code of the Netherlands, article 23|accessdate=9 October 2010|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;)) anyone who publicly, orally or in writing or depiction, offends religious feelings by scornful blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1966, the Public Prosecution Service prosecuted writer [[Gerard Reve]] under Article 147. In his novel ''Nader tot U'' ("''Nearer to Thee''"), Reve describes the narrator's sexual intercourse with God, who is incarnated in a donkey. The court of first instance convicted Reve, but he appealed. In April 1968, an appeals court quashed the conviction.&lt;ref name="RNW"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Blasphemy law ditched by the Dutch  | publisher = Radio Netherlands Worldwide  | date = 1 November 2008  | url = http://www.rnw.nl/pt-pt/node/1445  | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130112051746/http://www.rnw.nl/pt-pt/node/1445  | dead-url = yes  | archive-date = 12 January 2013  | accessdate = 28 August 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In November 2008, [[Ministry of Security and Justice (Netherlands)|Justice Minister]] Ernst [[Hirsch Ballin]] expressed the country's coalition government's intent to repeal Article 147.&lt;ref name = "RNW"/&gt; He said the government would strengthen the legislation against discrimination to prohibit any insult to any group of people.&lt;ref name = "DNews"&gt;{{cite web

According to the SGP, the decision to lift the ban on blasphemy is a "painful loss of a moral anchor and a symptom of a spiritual crisis".

On 1 February 2014, the law on blasphemy was officially abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Wet van 23 januari 2014 tot wijziging van het Wetboek van Strafrecht in verband met het laten vervallen van het verbod op godslastering, [[Staatsblad van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden|Stb.]] 2014, 39.

{{Main|Blasphemy law in New Zealand}}

In [[New Zealand]], Section 123&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329036.html?search=ts_act_Crimes%20Act%201961#DLM329036|title=Crimes Act 1961 No 43 (as at 07 November 2015), Public Act 123 Blasphemous libel – New Zealand Legislation|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Crimes Act 1961]] allows for imprisonment up to one year for anyone who publishes any "blasphemous libel". Cases are only prosecuted at the discretion of the New Zealand Attorney-General, who usually cites overriding free speech objections so as not to pursue such a case. The only prosecution for blasphemous libel in New Zealand was the case of John Glover, publisher of the newspaper ''The Maoriland Worker'', in 1922. Glover was acquitted.

The British comedy film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' (1979) about a fictional Jewish man living at the same time and neighbourhood as Jesus Christ, generated significant international controversy, and was banned in several countries including Ireland and Norway. Hundreds of letters were sent to Film Censor's Office to have the film banned in New Zealand as well on the grounds of it being 'blasphemous' against the Christian faith, but the Chief Censor of Films responded by stating that they had found no evidence of blasphemy or sacrilegiousness in the film.

In March 2018, Justice Minister [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] ([[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]) introduced legislation to repeal the blasphemy law. An earlier Labour repeal attempt in 2017 was blocked by the then governing [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/352935/outdated-blasphemy-law-to-be-repealed |title=Outdated blasphemy law to be repealed |author=Craig McCulloch |work=Radio New Zealand |date=20 March 2018 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British comedy film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' (1979) was briefly banned in Norway by the authorities in early 1980, because it 'was believed to commit the crime of blasphemy by violating people's religious feelings'. However, the ban was lifted in October 1980 after a group of theologians who had seen the film produced a statement saying that there was no good reason for a total ban. ''Life of Brian'' was allowed on the big screen, provided with a poster at the beginning which stated that Brian was not Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/30-ar-siden-life-of-brian-forbud-1.6942449 |title=Norsk forbud absolutt nonsens |author=Marit Hverven &amp; Mehda Ghalegolabi |work=NRK |date=12 January 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2018 |language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Philippines ====
"Crimes against religious worship" are stated under section four of the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines]]. Under article 132 and 133, respectively, "interruption of religious worship" and "offending the religious feelings" are punishable by law. "Interruption of religious worship" is defined as "preventing or disturbing the ceremonies or manifestations of any religion" and "offending the religious feelings" is defined as "performing acts notoriously offensive to the feelings of the faithful" in a place devoted to religious worship or during the celebration of any religious ceremony.&lt;ref name="dpwh.gov.ph"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/about_us/reforms/graft_n_corruption/pdf/Revised%20Penal%20Code1.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710120119/http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/About_Us/reforms/graft_n_corruption/pdf/Revised%20Penal%20Code1.pdf |archive-date=10 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penalties range from imprisonment of four months and a day to six months; crimes that involve violence or threats can carry a penalty of up to six years in jail.

==== Poland ====
While [[Poland]]'s penal code makes no reference to any sort of blasphemy law, it states that "Whoever offends religious feelings of other people by publicly insulting an object of religious cult or a place for public holding of religious ceremonies, is subject to a fine, restriction of liberty or loss of liberty for up to 2 years". The article has been used by pro-Church politicians and activists on numerous occasions, whenever they felt their religious feelings had been offended in some way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.racjonalista.pl/kk.php/s,345|title=Obraza uczuć religijnych|first=Mariusz|last=Agnosiewicz|trans-title= Offense of Religious Feelings|website=Racjonalista|language=pl|access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the article maintain that due to its vagueness it is prone to abuse by seriously limiting the freedom of speech and effectively preventing any kind of debate on the Church's widespread influence on social, sexual and political life of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.racjonalista.pl/kk.php/s,3440/q,Uczucia.religijne.ochrona.czy.cenzura|title=Uczucia religijne: ochrona czy cenzura?|first=Mariusz|last=Agnosiewicz|trans-title= Religious Feelings: Defense or Censorship?|website=Racjonalista|language=pl|access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable conviction on the basis of this law was that of the pop singer [[Doda (singer)|Dorota "Doda" Rabczewska]] who in 2012 was fined for the amount of 5,000 [[Polish złoty|złotys]] for saying in an interview that the Bible was written by people 'drunk on wine and smoking some kind of herbs'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rp.pl/artykul/894222-Doda-skazana-za-obraze-uczuc-religijnych.html#ap-1 Doda skazana za obrazę uczuć religijnych], rp.pl&lt;/ref&gt; Her complaint was rejected by the [[Constitutional Tribunal (Poland)|Constitutional Tribunal]] which confirmed the law did not violate the [[Constitution of Poland|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/skarga-dody-w-trybunale-konstytucyjnym-sedziowie-odrzucili-wniosek,583217.html Trybunał Konstytucyjny odrzucił skargę Dody.

Blasphemy is a [[common law offence]] in South Africa, defined as "unlawfully, intentionally and publicly acting contemptuously towards God."&lt;ref name=milton&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Milton |title=South African Criminal Law and Procedure: Common-law Crimes |edition=3rd |year=1996 |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta |isbn=9780702137730 |chapter=Chapter 17: Blasphemy |pages=293–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=burchell&gt;{{cite book |first=Jonathan |last=Burchell |title=Principles of Criminal Law |edition=3rd |year=2005 |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta |isbn=9780702165573 |chapter=Chapter 74: Blasphemy |pages=880–883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several legal writers have suggested that the illegality of blasphemy has become unconstitutional as a result of the adoption in 1994 of the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]], which includes the right to [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref name=smith-salj&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nicholas |last=Smith |title=The crime of blasphemy and the protection of fundamental human rights |journal=South African Law Journal |year=1999 |volume=116 |number=1 |pages=162–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="devos"&gt;{{cite web |first=Pierre |last=de Vos |authorlink=Pierre de Vos |title=On Woolworths and freedom of conscience |date=2 November 2012 |work=Constitutionally Speaking |url=http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/on-woolworths-and-freedom-of-conscience/ |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that it is unconstitutional because the criminal prohibition only applies to blasphemy against Christianity, and therefore discriminates on the basis of religion.&lt;ref name=milton /&gt;&lt;ref name=smith-salj /&gt;

Blasphemy prosecutions have been rare since the start of the twentieth century, to the point that writers in the early part of the century suggested that the crime had been abrogated through disuse. However, in 1934 a newspaper editor was convicted of blasphemy for publishing a story in which a [[nun]] has a vision of a sexual relationship with Jesus Christ, and the validity of the conviction was affirmed by the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Appellate Division]].&lt;ref name=smith-salj /&gt; In 1962 [[Harold Rubin]] was prosecuted for a painting depicting Christ naked on the cross along with inversions of Biblical sayings, but he was acquitted.&lt;ref name=smith-salj /&gt; In 1968 the editor of ''[[Varsity (Cape Town)|Varsity]]'' was prosecuted for publishing a report of a symposium on the topic "[[Is God Dead?]]", which quoted statements that "We must write God off entirely" and "[God] is beginning to stink".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stanley |last=Uys |title='Is God Dead?': Court Case Centers On Issue |date=20 January 1968 |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19680120&amp;id=cHJQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oloDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6289,6778619 |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted, but at sentencing received only a caution and discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher Edmond |last=Merrett |title=A Culture of Censorship: Secrecy and Intellectual Repression in South Africa |year=1994 |location=Cape Town |publisher=David Philip |isbn=0864862598 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 2000|Equality Act of 2000]] forbids [[hate speech]], which is defined as "words based on one or more of the prohibited grounds, against any person, that could reasonably be construed to demonstrate a clear intention to: (a) be hurtful; (b) be harmful or to incite harm; (c) promote or propagate hatred." The "prohibited grounds" include religion, and thus some blasphemous speech falls within the scope of hate speech. The prohibition of hate speech is, however, not a [[Criminal law|criminal]] prohibition, and only [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] penalties would result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 4 of 2000|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2000-004.pdf|publisher=Department of Justice and Constitutional Development|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spain ====
The article 525 of the penal law in Spain considers "vilification" of religious "feelings", "dogmas", "beliefs" or "rituals". This extension to "dogmas" and "beliefs" makes it very close to a blasphemy law in practice, depending on the interpretation of the judge.

For instance, in 2012 it was used to prosecute a famous artist, [[Javier Krahe]], for a scene (shot 34 years ago, and lasting just 54 seconds) in a documentary about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publico.es/espana/314232/juicio-oral-contra-javier-krahe-por-su-corto-como-cocinar-a-un-cristo|title=Juicio oral contra Javier Krahe por su corto 'Cómo cocinar a un Cristo'|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://elpais.com/sociedad/2012/06/08/actualidad/1339148077_418557.html Javier Krahe absuelto (El País, in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sweden ====
There is presently no act prohibiting blasphemy in the Swedish Law. In Sweden, a general principal developed during the 20th Century was that religion should be regarded as a private matter. Historically, Sweden had a blasphemy specific law introduced by King Erik XIV in 1563 that specifically protected religion, followed by similar Acts until 1949, when it was replaced by an Act on "Peace of Faith" which was a milder form of restriction. In 1970, the 1949 Act was repealed and a new Act was introduced on "agitation against a specific group of people". The new Act focuses on minority groups of a specific "race, skin colour, national or ethnic origin, faith or sexual orientation". Thus, the Act does not protect religion as such, but the group of people adhering to the religion. The new Act parallels Religious faith with the protection of people on the grounds of ethnicity or sexual orientation and has mostly been used in cases concerning agitation in relation to Jews and homosexuals.&lt;ref name="Eurel"&gt;[http://www.eurel.info/spip.php?rubrique542&amp;lang=en ''eurel'' Sociological and legal data on religions in Europe, Sweden, Blasphemy] 16 May 2014 Retrieved 6 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Switzerland ====

==== United Kingdom ====
{{Main|Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom}}

The United Kingdom is made up of four distinct parts and several legal jurisdictions. In criminal justice matters, these jurisdictions are [[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]]. Blasphemy laws dating back to the medieval times were repealed in England and Wales in 2008, but equivalent laws remain in statute in Scotland and Northern Ireland, though they have not been used in many years.

English blasphemy laws were historically defended with the following reasoning: the "[blasphemy] law is needed to uphold the national law, which is based on Christianity. Thus, targeting Christianity is targeting the very foundation of England."&lt;ref name="Gubo2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gubo|first=Darara Timotewos|title=Blasphemy And Defamation of Religions In a Polarized World: How Religious Fundamentalism Is Challenging Fundamental Human Rights|date=24 December 2014|publisher=Lexington Books|language=English|isbn=9780739189733|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last attempted prosecution under these laws was in 2007 when the evangelical group [[Christian Voice (UK)|Christian Voice]] sought a [[private prosecution]] against the [[BBC]] over its broadcasting of the show ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]'' (which includes a scene depicting Jesus, dressed as a baby, professing to be "a bit gay"). The charges were rejected by the [[City of Westminster]] magistrates court. Christian Voice applied to have this ruling overturned by the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], but the application was rejected. The court found that the [[common law]] blasphemy offences specifically did not apply to stage productions (s. 2(4) of the [[Theatres Act 1968]]) and broadcasts (s.&amp;nbsp;6 of the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The last successful blasphemy prosecution (also a private prosecution) was ''[[Whitehouse v. Lemon]]'' in 1977, when [[Denis Lemon]], the editor of ''[[Gay News]]'', was found guilty. His newspaper had published [[James Kirkup]]'s poem "[[The Love that Dares to Speak its Name]]", which allegedly vilified [[Christ]] and his life. Lemon was fined £500 and given a [[suspended sentence]] of nine months' imprisonment. It had been "touch and go", said the judge, whether he would actually send Lemon to jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pinktriangle.org.uk/glh/214/humphreys.html |title=Brett Humphreys: ''The Law That Dared to Lay the Blame'' |access-date=17 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172729/http://www.pinktriangle.org.uk/glh/214/humphreys.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a deliberate and well-publicized public repeat reading of the poem took place on the steps of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] church in [[Trafalgar Square]], but did not lead to any prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1401051/Erotic-poem-challenges-blasphemy-law.html|title=Erotic poem challenges blasphemy law|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1696, a Scottish court sentenced [[Thomas Aikenhead]] to death for blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=McLaurin's Arguments and Definitions |work=The Scots Magazine |date=1 July 1774 |accessdate=10 January 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000545/17740701/009/0028| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last prosecution for [[Scots law|blasphemy in Scotland]] was in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Barclay: ''A Digest of the Law of Scotland: With Special Reference to the Office'', T &amp; T Clark, Edinburgh, 1855, p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

The last person in Britain to be imprisoned for blasphemy was [[John William Gott]] on 9 December 1921. He had three previous convictions for blasphemy when he was prosecuted for publishing two pamphlets which satirized the biblical story of Jesus entering Jerusalem ([[Matthew 21]]:2–7), comparing Jesus to a circus clown. He was sentenced to nine months' hard labour.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In 1985, the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)]] published a report, ''Criminal Law: Offences against Religious and Public Worship'', that concluded that the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel should be abolished without replacement. On 5 March 2008, an amendment was passed to the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] which abolished the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel in England and Wales. (Common law is abolished, not repealed.)

==== United States ====
{{Main|Blasphemy law in the United States}}
[[File:An Act against Atheism and Blasphemy - Mass Bay Colony 1697.jpg|thumb|right|''"An Act against Atheism and Blasphemy"'' as enacted in 1697 in "His Majesty's PROVINCE of the MASSACHUSETTS-BAY in NEW-ENGLAND" (1759 printing)]]

A prosecution for blasphemy in the United States would be a violation of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and no blasphemy laws exist at the federal level. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (adopted in 1791) provides: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or '''abridging the freedom of speech''', or of the press . . . ."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before [[American Revolutionary War|winning their independence]] from the [[British Empire]] in the late 18th century, some of the [[British America|British colonies in North America]] such as the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] had blasphemy laws. The 1791 First Amendment effectively put an end to them in the new American republic.

Because of the First Amendment's protection of free speech and religious exercise from federal interference, and the Supreme Court's extension of those protections against state regulation, the United States and its constituent state governments may not prosecute blasphemous speech or religious insults and may not allow civil actions on those grounds. In ''[[Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1952 that [[New York (state)|New York]] could not enforce a censorship law against filmmakers whose films contained "sacrilegious" content. The opinion of the Court, by Justice Clark, stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"From the standpoint of freedom of speech and the press, it is enough to point out that the state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them which is sufficient to justify prior restraints upon the expression of those views. It is not the business of government in our nation to suppress real or imagined attacks upon a particular religious doctrine, whether they appear in publications, speeches, or motion pictures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0343_0495_ZO.html|title=Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The United States and some individual state jurisdictions provide for stronger criminal penalties for crimes when committed against a person because of that person's religious or some other affiliations. For instance, Section 3A1.1 of the 2009 United States Sentencing Guidelines states that: "If the finder of fact at trial or, in the case of a plea of guilty or [[nolo contendere]], the court at sentencing determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally selected any victim or any property as the object of the offense of conviction because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, or sexual orientation of any person," the sentencing court is required to increase the standard sentencing range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/GL2009.pdf United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual § 3A1.1 (2009)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215045940/http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/GL2009.pdf |date=15 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predominantly Muslim-majority countries ===
In a number of countries where Islam is the state religion, Islamic [[sharia]] law is the principal legislation, or affects the laws of the country. [[Islam and blasphemy|Blasphemy in Islam]] is impious utterance or action concerning God, Muhammad or anything considered sacred in Islam. The Islamic holy book, the [[Qur'an]], admonishes blasphemy, but does not specify the punishment. The [[hadith]]s, which are another source of sharia, suggest various punishments for blasphemy. &lt;!--From [[Blasphemy in Islam]] --&gt;

Some states in the Malaysian federation operate Sharia courts to protect Islam, and, when Sharia is not applicable, the Malaysian Penal Code provides penalties for offenses against religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Mauritania ====
The crime of apostasy is defined in section IV (entitled Act of Indecency toward Islam) of the Mauritanian Penal Code, established under the order of 9 July 1983. Article 306, paragraph 1 of the criminal code indicates, "Every Muslim guilty of the crime of apostasy, either by word or by action of apparent or obvious, will be invited to repent within three days."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talsou.wesign.it/en |title=TALSOUH: Free Mohamed Cheikh sentenced to death in Mauritania |publisher=Talsou.wesign.it |date= |accessdate=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[State of Palestine]] has several provisions in civil and military law against blasphemy. An infamous 2010 case, in which these were employed to attempt a prosecution, was that of [[Waleed Al-Husseini]], a young man from the West Bank town of [[Qalqilya]] who had [[apostasy in Islam|left Islam]] to become an [[atheism|atheist]], and openly challenged and ridiculed religion online. He was arrested without charges and jailed in October 2010, after which the [[Palestinian Authority]] alleged Al-Husseini had committed blasphemy on the Internet.&lt;ref name="Kershner"&gt;{{cite news |title=Palestinian Blogger Angers West Bank Muslims |author=Isabel Kershner |newspaper=The New York Times |date=15 November 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/world/europe/16blogger.html |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Palestinian human rights expert at the time expected Al-Husseini to be tried according to a 1960 Jordanian law against defaming religion, which was still in force in the West Bank.&lt;ref name="Kershner"/&gt; Instead, Al-Husseini was charged with three counts of indictment according to the Palestine Military Code of Justice, namely: "inciting religious hatred" (Article 177), "insulting religious leaders" (Article 225 and 226/B), and "offending religious views" (Article 230/A).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Al-Husseini |first=Waleed |date=2017 |title=The Blasphemer: The Price I Paid for Rejecting Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwuqDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT95 |location= |publisher= |page=95 |isbn= |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually released after 10 months in prison due to heavy international diplomatic pressure, primarily exerted by France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=al-Husseini |first=Waleed |date=8 December 2014 |title=What It's Like to Be an Atheist in Palestine |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/08/what-it-s-like-to-be-an-atheist-in-palestine.html |newspaper=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anti-Pakistani blasphemy law protest, Centenary Square, Bradford (8th November 2014) (cropped 1).JPG|thumb|Protest to repeal Pakistan's blasphemy law in [[Bradford]] (2014)]]
More people are on death row or serving life sentences for blasphemy in Pakistan than in any other country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Annual Report'' of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, 2016 page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-blasphemy laws in [[Pakistan]] are quite complicated. Offenders may be vigorously prosecuted. Chapter XV of [[Pakistan Penal Code]] deals with "offences relating to religion":&lt;ref name="pakistancode"&gt;[http://www.fmu.gov.pk/docs/laws/Pakistan%20Penal%20Code.pdf Pakistan Penal Code] Chap. XV "Of Offences Relating to Religion" pp. 79–81&lt;/ref&gt;
* §295. Injuring or defiling place of worship, with intent to insult the religion of any class.&lt;ref name="pakistancode" /&gt;
* §295-A. Deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting Its religion or religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="pakistancode" /&gt;
* §295-B. Defiling, etc., of Holy Qur'an.&lt;ref name="pakistancode" /&gt;
* §295-C. Use of derogatory remarks, etc., in respect of the Holy Prophet.&lt;ref name="pakistancode" /&gt;
* §296. Disturbing religious assembly.&lt;ref name="pakistancode" /&gt;
* §297. Trespassing on burial places, etc.&lt;ref name="pakistancode" /&gt;

* §298-A. Use of derogatory remarks, etc., in respect of holy personages.&lt;ref name="pakistancode" /&gt;
* §298-B. Misuse of epithets, descriptions and titles, etc., reserved for certain holy personages or places.&lt;ref name="pakistancode" /&gt;
* §298-C. Person of [[Qadiani]] group, etc., calling himself a Muslim or preaching or propagating his faith:&lt;ref name="pakistancode" /&gt;

There is a death penalty for blasphemy in Pakistan (only under section 295 c). Those prosecuted are usually minorities such as [[Ahmadiyya]] and [[Christian]]s but it seems that they are also increasingly other Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ahmed | first = Akbar S. | title = Pakistan's Blasphemy Law: Words Fail Me | publisher = The Washington Post | date = 19 May 2002 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A36108-2002May17&amp;notFound=true  | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120917205957/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A36108-2002May17&amp;notFound=true  | dead-url = yes  | archive-date = 17 September 2012  | accessdate = 28 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persons accused of blasphemy as well as police, lawyers, and judges have been subject to harassment, threats, attacks, and murders when blasphemy is the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Asma Jahangir | publisher = United Nations | date = 8 October 2008 | url = http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/opinion/articles1920_iccpr/docs/experts_cvs/Jaghanfir%20bis.doc | accessdate = 27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008 Pakistan's government appointed [[Shahbaz Bhatti]] as Federal Minister for Minorities and gave him cabinet rank. Bhatti had promised that the [[Asif Ali Zardari]] government would review Pakistan's blasphemy laws.&lt;ref name="Pak2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom May 2009 |work=Pakistan |publisher=[[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] |date=May 2009 |url=http://www.uscirf.gov/images/AR2009/pakistan.pdf |accessdate=24 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508182340/http://www.uscirf.gov/images/AR2009/pakistan.pdf |archivedate=8 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan has been an active supporter of the campaign by the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] to create global laws against [[Blasphemy#Blasphemy and the United Nations|blasphemy]].&lt;ref name="Pak2009"/&gt;
Minister Bhatti was shot dead on 2 March 2011 in [[Islamabad]], the capital of Pakistan. On 19 March 2014, Pakistani English-language newspaper, ''The Nation'', conducted a poll of its readers that showed 68% of Pakistanis believe the blasphemy law should be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Share : |url=http://www.nation.com.pk/E-Paper/lahore/2014-03-19/page-7 |title=ePaper &amp; Archives &amp;#8211 The Nation |publisher=Nation.com.pk |date=2014-03-19 |accessdate=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016 a sixteen-year-old Christian teenage boy, Nabeel Chohan, was arrested in Pakistan after he "liked" a Facebook post that was allegedly blasphemous. According to Punjab Police the teenager, was jailed and was awaiting trial for sharing the post on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/teenage-boy-christian-arrested-sharing-blasphemous-facebook-post-in-pakistan-nabeel-chohan-kaaba-a7321156.html|title=Teenage boy arrested for sharing 'blasphemous' Facebook post|date=2016-09-21|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017 an obscure Islamist group Tehreek-i-Labaik Ya Rasool Allah Pakistan in Pakistan staged a sit-in in the capital Islamabad. They forced the government to abandon an amendment to the oath sworn by election candidates that allowed for a variation in the oath because of the candidates religious beliefs. They also caused the law minister Zahid Hamid to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/34511/Pakistan-s-blasphemy-law-hands-fringe-Islamists-dangerous-weapon|title=Pakistan's blasphemy law hands fringe Islamists dangerous weapon - Egypt Today|website=www.egypttoday.com|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam is Saudi Arabia's [[state religion]]. The country's monarchy follows [[Sunni Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The country's laws are an amalgam of rules from Sharia, royal edicts, and [[Fatwa|fatawa]] from the Council of Senior Religious Scholars; they prescribe penalties up to the death penalty for blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&amp;id=4FBA416ABC8805C2802569A600603109|title=News|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322025221/http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&amp;id=4FBA416ABC8805C2802569A600603109|archive-date=22 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sudan ====
Sunni Islam is the [[separation of church and state|state religion]] of Sudan. Before [[South Sudan]] received independence, about seventy percent{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} of the country's population was Muslim. The next largest group—about twenty-five percent of the population—was [[animist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Section 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Act prohibits "insulting religion, inciting hatred and showing contempt for religious beliefs". The section includes as penalties: imprisonment, a fine, and a maximum of forty [[lashes]]. In November 2007, the section gave rise to the [[Sudanese teddy bear blasphemy case]]. In December 2007, the section was used against two Egyptian booksellers. They were sentenced to six months in prison because they sold a book that the court deemed an insult to Aisha, one of [[Prophet Mohammed]]'s wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In May 2005, the authorities arrested Mohammed Taha Mohammed Ahmed, and charged him with violating section 125. Ahmed was the editor-in-chief of a daily newspaper ''Al-Wifaq''. The paper had published an article about a 500-year-old Islamic manuscript which says the real name of Mohammed's father was not Abdallah but Abdel Lat, or ''Slave of Lat'', an idol of the pre-Islamic era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alarm about trial of journalist on blasphemy charge |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |date=12 May 2005 |url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=13760 |accessdate=29 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030205732/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=13760 |archivedate=30 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A court fined Al-Wifaq eight million Sudanese pounds—the paper was shut down for three months—but acquitted Ahmed.

Article 216 of the Turkish Penal Code ("Provoking people to be rancorous and hostile") criminalizes blasphemy and religious insult, as well as hate speech. The article, which is in the fifth section of the Turkish Penal Code ("Offenses Against Public Peace") is as follows:

:'''Article 216. – Provoking people to be rancorous and hostile'''

:''(1) Any person who openly provokes a group of people belonging to different social class, religion, race, sect, or coming from another origin, to be rancorous or hostile against another group, is punished with imprisonment from one year to three years in case of such act causes risk from the aspect of public safety.''

:''(2) Any person who openly humiliates another person just because he belongs to different social class, religion, race, sect, or comes from another origin, is punished with imprisonment from six months to one year.''

:''(3) Any person who openly disrespects the religious belief of a group is punished with imprisonment from six months to one year if such act causes potential risk for public peace.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/6872/preview |title=Legislationline |publisher=Legislationline |date= |accessdate=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations of blasphemy in [[Yemen]] are often aimed at religious minorities, intellectuals and artists, reporters, [[human rights defenders]], and opponents of the ruling party. Vigilantism or abuse by the authorities can kill an accused or force them into exile. The accused in Yemen is subject to Islamic law (Sharia). Sharia, according to some interpretations, prescribes death as the proper punishment for blasphemy.

In [[Israel]], blasphemy is covered by Articles 170 and 173 of the penal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7_%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9F|title=חוק העונשין – ויקיטקסט|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/15/58/43289694.pdf Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''170. If a person destroys, damages or desecrates a place of worship or any object which is held sacred by a group of persons, with the intention of reviling their religion, or in the knowledge that they are liable to deem that act an insult to their religion, then the one is liable to three years' imprisonment.''

:''Injury to religious sentiment''
:''173. If a person does any of the following, then the one is liable to one year's imprisonment:''
:''(1) One publishes a publication that is liable to crudely offend the religious faith or sentiment of others;''
:''(2) One voices in a public place and in the hearing of another person any word or sound that is liable to crudely offend the religious faith or sentiment of others.''

The law is traced back to the [[British High Commission]] "The Abuse and Vilification (religious invective) Order No. 43 of 1929", enacted in efforts to suppress the [[1929 Palestine riots]]. The order contained the language: "Any person who utters a word or sound in public or within earshot of any other person that may be or is intended to offend his religious sensitivities or faith can expect to be found guilty and eligible for a one-year jail sentence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/make-fun-of-god-but-leave-his-believers-alone-1.98346 "Make fun of God, but leave his believers alone"], ''[[Haaretz]]'', 27 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter XV

OF OFFENCES RELATING TO RELIGION
*295. Injuring or defiling place of worship, with intent to insult the religion of any class.
*295A. Deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs.
*296. Disturbing religious assembly.
*297. Trespassing on burial - places, etc.
*298. Uttering words, etc; with deliberate intent to wound religious feelings.

Section 295 and 295A carry a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment, a fine, or both, and sections 296, 297 and 298 a maximum of one year's imprisonment, a fine, or both. Section 295A was added to the Penal code by a legislative amendment in 1927 and was intended to protect religious minorities. It was a response to a perceived need to prohibit incitement against Muslim minorities by Hindu nationalists in India, but is now used in Myanmar to protect Buddhist nationalists against prosecution for incitement against Muslim minorities!&lt;ref name=TheDiplomat /&gt;

In December 2014, bar owner Tun Thurein and bar managers Htut Ko Lwin and New Zealander Philip Blackwood who ran the VGastro Bar in [[Yangon]] were arrested and sentenced in March 2015 to two-and-a-half years of hard labour after posting a psychedelic image of the Buddha wearing headphones to promote their bar on the internet. in June 2015, writer and former National League for Democracy information officer, Htin Lin Oo was sentenced to two years of hard labour for violating section 295A. The charge resulted from a speech in which he accused several prominent Buddhist organisations of extreme nationalism with particularly reference to [[Ashin Wirathu]], who has been accused of hate speech and incitement of violence against Muslims by international observers many times since anti-Rohingya violence erupted in 2012.&lt;ref name=TheDiplomat /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/opinion/15579-blasphemy-statutes-deny-human-rights.html |title=Myanmar's Blasphemy statutes deny human rights |publisher=''Myanmar Times'' |date=21 July 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/06/29/they-can-arrest-you-any-time/criminalization-peaceful-expression-burma |title="They can arrest you at any time" − The Criminalization of Peaceful Expression in Burma |publisher=''Human Rights Watch'' |date=29 June 2016 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) 1976 obliges signatory countries to guarantee everyone the right to hold opinions without restriction and to guarantee the right to freedom of expression, to impart information and ideas of all kinds, either orally, in writing or in print, in art, or through any other media. Paragraph 3 of article 19 allows for certain restrictions to freedom expression that are both necessary and provided by law to safeguard the reputations of others, for the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health or morals and article 20 obliges countries to prohibit "propaganda for war or advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence."&lt;ref name="Hashemi2008"/&gt;

In July 2011, the [[UN Human Rights Committee]] released a 52-paragraph statement, General Comment 34 on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, concerning freedoms of opinion and expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/GC34.pdf ''United Nations Human Rights Committee General Comment 34 on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 1976'']&lt;/ref&gt; Paragraph 48 states: 
:Prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system, including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the Covenant, except in the specific circumstances envisaged in article 20, paragraph 2, of the Covenant. Such prohibitions must also comply with the strict requirements of article 19, paragraph 3, as well as such articles as 2, 5, 17, 18 and 26. Thus, for instance, it would be impermissible for any such laws to discriminate in favour of or against one or certain religions or belief systems, or their adherents over another, or religious believers over non-believers. Nor would it be permissible for such prohibitions to be used to prevent or punish criticism of religious leaders or commentary on religious doctrine and tenets of faith.

The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] have petitioned the "[[United Nations]] to create global laws criminalising insults to religion".&lt;ref name="Lester2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=Anthony|title=Five Ideas to Fight For: How Our Freedom Is Under Threat and Why It Matters|date=18 April 2016|publisher=Oneworld Publications|language=English|isbn=9781780747620|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three United Nations Special Rapporteurs—the Special Rapporteurs on freedom of religion or belief, on the right to freedom of opinion and expression and on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance—released a joint statement during the Durban Review Conference in Geneva in 2009. They stated that: "the difficulties in providing an objective definition of the term "defamation of religions" at the international level make the whole concept open to abuse. At the national level, domestic blasphemy laws can prove counter-productive, since this could result in the de facto censure of all inter-religious and intra-religious criticism. Many of these laws afford different levels of protection to different religions and have often proved to be applied in a discriminatory manner. There are numerous examples of persecution of religious minorities or dissenters, but also of atheists and non-theists, as a result of legislation on religious offences or overzealous application of laws that are fairly neutral."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/English/issues/religion/docs/SRjointstatement22april09.pdf ''Freedom of expression and incitement to racial or religious hatred''] Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) side event 22 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rabat Plan of Action (2012) on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence ''Conclusions and recommendations emanating from the four regional expert workshops organised by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in 2011, and adopted by experts in Rabat, Morocco on 5 October 2012'' stated that: "At the national level, blasphemy laws are counter-productive, since they may result in the de facto censure of all inter-religious/belief and intra-religious/belief dialogue, debate, and also criticism, most of which could be constructive, healthy and needed. In addition, many of these blasphemy laws afford different levels of protection to different religions and have often proved to be applied in a discriminatory manner. There are numerous examples of persecution of religious minorities or dissenters, but also of atheists and non-theists, as a result of legislation on religious offences or overzealous application of various laws that use a neutral language. Moreover, the right to freedom of religion or belief, as enshrined in relevant international legal standards, does not include the right to have a religion or a belief that is free from criticism or ridicule." The Plan of Action recommended that: "States that have blasphemy laws should repeal these as such laws have a stifling impact on the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief and healthy dialogue and debate about religion".&lt;ref name=Rabat&gt;''Rabat Plan of Action on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence'' Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 5 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns for repeal ==
France repealed its blasphemy law in 1881, Sweden in 1970. A series of countries, especially in Europe, began repealing their blasphemy laws in the early 21st century. A systematic global campaign to abolish all blasphemy laws around the world was launched under the slogan "End Blasphemy Laws" by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU), the [[European Humanist Federation]] (EHF) and numerous coalition partners on 30 January 2015, in direct response to the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]] on 7 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://end-blasphemy-laws.org/2015/01/lets-abolish-all-blasphemy-laws-worldwide/#more-396 |title=Let's abolish all blasphemy laws, worldwide |work=End Blasphemy Laws |publisher=IHEU &amp; EHF |date=30 January 2015 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== European initiatives ===
The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]], which has been deliberating on the issue of blasphemy law, the resolution that blasphemy should not be a criminal offence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-en.asp?fileid=17569&amp;lang=en Recommendation 1805 (2007) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.]&lt;/ref&gt; adopted on 29 June 2007 in the Recommendation 1805 (2007) on blasphemy, religious insults and hate speech against persons on grounds of their religion. This Recommendation set a number of guidelines for member states of the [[Council of Europe]] in view of Articles 10 (freedom of expression) and 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

In place of blasphemy or in addition to blasphemy in some European countries is the crime of "religious insult", which is a subset of the crime of blasphemy. {{As of|2009|3}}, it was forbidden in Andorra, Cyprus, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Spain, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Slovakia, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Vella. [http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2009/03/08/t13.html "Blasphemy? It's not criminal – Council of Europe"], ''Malta Today''. 8 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 October 2008, the [[Venice Commission]], the Council of Europe's advisory body on constitutional matters, issued a report about blasphemy, religious insult, and incitement to religious hatred.&lt;ref  name=Venice&gt;European Commission for Democracy through Law. [http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=CDL-AD(2008)026-e 'Report on the Relationship between Freedom of Expression and Freedom of Religion: The issue of Regulation and Prosecution of blasphemy, religious insult, and incitement to religious hatred']. Adopted by the Venice Commission at its 76th Plenary Session at [[Venice]], [[Italy]], on 17–18 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that, at the time in Europe, blasphemy was an offence in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Italy, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, and San Marino.

=== Repealings by jurisdiction ===
The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were abolished in England and Wales in 2008 with the passage of the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|Criminal Justice and Immigration Act]].&lt;ref name="Beckford"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beckford|first1=Martin|title=Blasphemy laws are lifted|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1942668/Blasphemy-laws-are-lifted.html|work=The Telegraph|date=10 May 2008 |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries to abolish or repeal blasphemy laws include France in 1881 (except for the [[Alsace-Lorraine|Alsace-Moselle region]], part of Germany at the time), Sweden in 1970, Norway with Acts in 2009 and 2015, the Netherlands in 2014, Iceland in 2015, Malta in 2016, France for its Alsace-Moselle region in 2016, and Denmark in 2017. [[Blasphemy law in Australia#The Commonwealth of Australia|Australia]] abolished and repealed all blasphemy laws at the Federal Level in 1995 but blasphemy laws remain in some States and Territories.&lt;ref name="Temperman"/&gt; On 26 October 2018, a [[Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018|referendum]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] resulted in the removal of the Constitutional provision and the 2009 Defamation Act provision against blasphemy, which would be implemented soon.&lt;ref name="RTEvote"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2975">'''BUMA/STEMRA''' are two private organizations in the [[Netherlands]], the Buma Association ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Vereniging Buma'') and the Stemra Foundation ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Stichting Stemra'') that operate as one single company that acts as the Dutch [[collecting society]] for [[composer]]s and [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bumastemra.nl/en-US/OverBumaStemra/Organisatie/Organisatiestructuur.htm |title=The Buma Association and the Stemra Foundation |accessdate=9 January 2009 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=14 May 2007 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Buma/Stemra |location= |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=Buma/Stemra operates as a single company. Nevertheless, the organisation consists of two separate bodies, Vereniging Buma (the Buma Association) and Stichting Stemra (the Stemra Foundation), each with its own members and affiliates and its own board of directors.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Buma Association was set up by Dutch music authors and publishers in 1913, one year after the [[Dutch copyright law|Dutch Copyright Act]] &lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Auteursrecht]], on the Dutch version of Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; was passed. In 1936, with the arrival of the [[gramophone record]], the replication of music multiplied. Realising its impact, the members of the Buma Association created the Stemra Foundation, which focuses on the replication of recorded works of music, ranging from LPs to CDs to Internet and mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bumastemra.nl/en-US/OverBumaStemra/Organisatie/Historie.htm |title=History |accessdate=9 January 2009 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=14 May 2007 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Buma/Stemra |location= |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Buma/Stemra sued Consumer Empowerment, then the owners of [[Kazaa]] in the Netherlands. The court ordered Kazaa's owners to take steps to prevent its users from violating copyrights or else pay a heavy fine. In October 2001 a lawsuit was filed against Consumer Empowerment by members of the music and motion picture industry in the USA. In response Consumer Empowerment sold the Kazaa application to Sharman Networks, headquartered in Australia and incorporated in Vanuatu. In late March 2002, a Dutch court of appeal reversed an earlier judgment and stated that Kazaa was not responsible for the actions of its users. Buma/Stemra lost its appeal before the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands]] in December 2003.

[[File:Community property states.svg|thumb|Map of the United States with community property states in red. Additionally, [[Alaska]] is an elective community property state, and of the five inhabited US territories, [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Guam]] are community property jurisdictions.]]

'''Community property''' is a [[marital property regime]] under which most property acquired during the [[marriage]] (except for gifts or inheritances), the ''community'', or ''communio bonorum'', is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon [[divorce]], [[annulment]], or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.&lt;ref&gt;''See v. See'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/64C2d778.htm 64 Cal. 2d 778] (1966). Chief Justice [[Roger J. Traynor]] of the [[Supreme Court of California]] wrote: "If funds used for acquisitions during marriage cannot otherwise be traced to their source and the husband who has commingled property is unable to establish that there was a deficit in the community accounts when the assets were purchased, the presumption controls that property acquired by purchase during marriage is community property. The husband may protect his separate property by not commingling community and separate assets and income. Once he commingles, he assumes the burden of keeping records adequate to establish the balance of community income and expenditures at the time an asset is acquired with commingled property." The See family, of course, was the family that founded [[See's Candies]], a major manufacturer and retailer of candy on the West Coast of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;

Division of community property may take place by item by splitting all items or by values. In some jurisdictions, such as [[California]], a 50/50 division of community property is strictly mandated by statute&lt;ref&gt;See [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/fam/2550-2556.html California Family Code section 2550].&lt;/ref&gt; so the focus then shifts to whether particular items are to be classified as community or separate property. In other jurisdictions, such as [[Texas]], a divorce court may decree an "[[equitable distribution]]" of community property, which may result in an ''unequal division'' of such. In non-community property states property may be divided by equitable distribution. Generally speaking, the property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called '''separate property''' (not community property). See [[division of property]]. Division of community debts may not be the same as division of community property. For example, in California, community property is required to be divided "equally" while community debt is required to be divided "equitably".&lt;ref&gt;See ''In re Marriage of Eastis'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA3/47CA3d459.htm 47 Cal. App. 3d 459] (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

Property owned by one spouse before the marriage is sometimes referred to as the "separate property" of that spouse, but there are instances in which the community can gain an interest in separate property and even situations in which separate property can be "transmuted" into community property. The rules vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

==Basis==
The community property concept originated in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions but is now also found in some [[common law]] jurisdictions. The [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[United States]] that recognize community property are primarily in the [[Western United States]]; it was inherited from [[Mexico]]'s ganancial community system,&lt;ref&gt;The half-borrowed term ''ganancial'' (from Spanish ''sociedad de gananciales'') was used in some early US community property opinions, such as ''Stramler v. Coe'', 15 Tex. 211, 215 (1855); it has been used occasionally in some more recent opinions such as ''Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo'', {{ussc|439|572|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which itself was inherited from [[Spanish law]] (a [[Roman law|Roman]]-derived [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system) and ultimately from the [[Visigothic Code]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean A. Stuntz]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=fd4PuhPOR5kC&amp;pg=PA1 ''Hers, His, and Theirs: Community Property Law in Spain and Early Texas,''] ([[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]: [[Texas Tech University Press]], 2005), 1-31. The source explains at length the [[Visigoths]]' legal protections for the property rights of married women and how later legal systems on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] continued such rights.&lt;/ref&gt; While under Spanish rule, [[Louisiana]] adopted the ganancial community system of acquests and gains, which replaced the traditional [[French law|French]] community of movables and acquests in its [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system.&lt;ref&gt;The author of the Louisiana Code was Moreau Lislet; see Hans W. Baade, "Transplants of Laws and of Lawyers", [Doc], retrieved 3 Dec. 2010 &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmb.unimore.it/on-line/Home/Prova/documento36005534.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722063200/http://www.csmb.unimore.it/on-line/Home/Prova/documento36005534.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The community property system is usually justified by the pragmatic recognition that such joint ownership recognizes the theoretically equal contributions of both spouses to the creation and operation of the [[family]] unit, a basic component of [[civil society]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Meyer v. Kinzer and Wife'', 12 Cal. 247 (1859). Chief Justice [[Stephen Johnson Field]] of the [[Supreme Court of California]] wrote: "The statute proceeds upon the theory that the marriage, in respect to property acquired during its existence, is a community of which each spouse is a member, equally contributing by his or her industry to its prosperity, and possessing an equal right to succeed to the property after dissolution, in case of surviving the other."&lt;/ref&gt;  The countervailing majority view in most U.S. states, as well as federal law, which is based on traditional American [[family values]] and [[gender role]]s, is that marriage is a [[sacrament|sacred]] compact in which a man assumes a "deeply rooted" ''moral'' obligation to [[alimony|support his wife]] [[child support|and child]], whereas community property essentially [[reductionism|reduces]] marriage to an "amoral business relationship".&lt;ref&gt;"[F]amily support obligations are deeply rooted moral responsibilities, while the community property concept is more akin to an amoral business relationship." See ''Rose v. Rose'', {{ussc|481|619|1987}}, and in particular, the ''Rose'' opinion's discussion of ''Wissner v. Wissner'', {{ussc|338|655|1950}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdictions==

In the [[United States]] there are nine community property states: [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Idaho]], [[Louisiana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part25/irm_25-018-001.html |title=Internal Revenue Manual – 25.18.1 Basic Principles of Community Property Law |website=www.irs.gov |access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alaska has also adopted a community property system, but it is optional. Spouses may create community property by entering into a community property agreement or by creating a community property trust.&lt;ref&gt;See Alaska Stat. §§&amp;nbsp;34.77.020 – 34.77.995&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Tennessee adopted a law similar to Alaska's and allows residents and non-residents to opt into community property through a community property trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wyattfirm.com/uploads/1057/doc/EP_News_and_Update_Community_Property.pdf |title= |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]] allows property to be owned as community property also&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part25/irm_25-018-001.html |title=Internal Revenue Manual – 25.18.1 Basic Principles of Community Property Law |website=www.irs.gov |access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do several Native American jurisdictions. In the case of Puerto Rico, the island had been under community property law since its settlement by Spain in 1493.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}} The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar statute allowing spouses to elect a community property system under Oklahoma law would not be recognized for federal income tax reporting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Commissioner v. Harmon, 323 U.S. 44 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; The Harmon decision should also apply to the Alaska system for income reporting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part25/irm_25-018-001.html |title=Internal Revenue Manual – 25.18.1 Basic Principles of Community Property Law |website=www.irs.gov |access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If property is held as community property, each spouse technically owns an undivided one-half interest in the property. This type of ownership applies to most property acquired by each spouse during the course of the marriage. It generally does not apply to property acquired prior to the marriage or to property acquired by gift or inheritance during the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ruesch |first1=Eric |title=Texas Separate vs. Community Property: Know What You Own |url=http://rueschlaw.com/2014/11/texas-separate-vs-community-property-dallas-estate-planning-and-family-law/ |website=rueschlaw.com |accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a divorce, community property is divided equally in some states and according to the discretion of the court in the other states.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

It is extremely important to bear in mind that there are no two community property states with exactly the same laws on the subject. The statutes or judicial decisions in one state may be completely opposite to those of another state on a particular legal issue. For example, in some community property states (so-called "American Rule" states), income from separate property is also separate. In others (so-called "Civil Law" states), the income from separate property is community property. The right of a creditor to reach community property in satisfaction of a debt or other obligation incurred by one or both of the spouses also varies from state to state.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

Community property has certain federal tax implications, which the [[Internal Revenue Service]] discusses in its Publication 555.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Publication 55: Community Property |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p555.pdf |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |date=March 2012 |accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, community property may result in lower federal [[Capital gains tax|capital gain taxes]] after the death of one spouse when the surviving spouse then sells the property. Some states have created a newer form of community property, called "community property with [[right of survivorship]]." This form of holding title has some similarities to [[joint tenancy]] with right of survivorship. The rules and effect of holding title as community property (or another form of concurrent ownership) vary from state to state.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

Because community property law affects the property of all married persons in the states in which it is in effect, it can have substantial consequences upon dissolution of the marriage from the perspective of the spouse forced to share a valuable asset that he or she thought was separate property.  One of the most spectacular examples of this in recent memory was the [[2011 Los Angeles Dodgers ownership dispute]], in which [[Frank McCourt (executive)|Frank McCourt]] paid his ex-wife [[Jamie McCourt]] about $130 million to avoid a trial over whether the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] were actually community property after the trial court ruled that the McCourts' [[prenuptial agreement]] was invalid.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Shaikin, [http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/17/sports/la-sp-1017-mccourt-divorce-settlement-20111017 "Frank and Jamie McCourt reach settlement involving Dodgers"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 17 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, one sign of community property's importance is that the states of California, Idaho, Louisiana, and Texas have made it a mandatory subject on their [[bar examination]]s, so that ''all'' lawyers in those states will be able to educate their clients appropriately.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

==Issues==

Often a new couple acquires a family residence. If the marriage terminates in subsequent years, there can be difficult community property problems to solve. For instance, often there is a contribution of separate property; or legal title may be held in the name of one party and not the other. There may also have been an inheritance or substantial gift from the family of one of the spouses during the marriage, whose proceeds were used to buy a property or pay down a [[mortgage loan|mortgage]]. Case law and applicable formulas vary among community property jurisdictions to apply to these and many other situations, to determine and divide community and separate property interest in such a residence and other property.

Community property issues often arise in divorce proceedings and disputes after the death of one spouse. These disputes can often be avoided by proper estate planning during the spouses' joint lifetime. This may or may not involve [[probate]] proceedings. Property acquired before marriage is separate and belongs to the spouse who acquired it. Property acquired during marriage is presumed to belong to the community estate except if acquired by inheritance or gift, or by exchange for other separate property. This definition leads to numerous issues that can be difficult to ascertain. For instance, where a spouse owns a business when marrying, it is clearly separate at that time. But if the business grows during the marriage, then what of the additional property acquired during marriage? Do they not result from labor of the spouses? Were some of the funds that were used to pay for the property community funds while a portion of the funds were separate property?

Community property may consist of property of all types, including real property ("immovable property" in civil law jurisdictions) and personal property ("movable property" in civil law jurisdictions) such as accounts in financial institutes, stocks, bonds, and cash.

A [[pension]] or [[Life annuity|annuity]] may have first been acquired before a marriage. But if contributions are made with community property during marriage, then proceeds are partly separate property and partly community property. Upon divorce or death of a party to the marriage, there are rules for apportionment.

[[Option (finance)|Options]] are also difficult to ascertain. A [[stock]] option is a right to purchase [[Share (finance)|shares]] of a company at a fixed price. Companies with growth potential sometimes award stock options as compensation to employees, during times when there is not enough money to pay a suitable salary. By accepting a stock option for compensation, an employee invests his or her own trust in the belief that he or she will help make the company acquire a higher value. Thereafter, the employee works and contributes value to the company. If the company later acquires a higher share valuation, then the employee may "cash in" his options by selling them at the fair market value. The employee's trust in this future value motivates his work without immediate compensation. That effort has value. If the marriage is terminated before the shares are cashed in, then the parties must decide how to apportion the community property portion of the options. This can be difficult. Case law precedents are not yet available for all situations involving stock options.

==Quasi-community property==
Quasi-community property is a concept recognized by some community property states. For example, in California, quasi-community property is defined by statute as

&lt;blockquote&gt;all real or personal property, wherever situated, acquired before or after the operative date of this code in any of the following ways:

(a) By either spouse while domiciled elsewhere which would have been community property if the spouse who acquired the property had been domiciled in this state at the time of its acquisition.

(b) In exchange for real or personal property, wherever situated, which would have been community property if the spouse who acquired the property so exchanged had been domiciled in this state at the time of its acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/fam/50-155.html California Family Code Section 125]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Typically, such property is treated as if it were community property at the time of divorce or death of a spouse, but in California, at least, property acquired while married and domiciled in a non-community property jurisdiction does not become community property just because the married parties move to a community property jurisdiction. It is the new event of divorce or death while domiciled in the community property state that allows that state to treat such property as quasi-community property.&lt;ref&gt;Addison v. Addison (1965) 62 Cal.2d 558, 399 P.2d 897.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018}}, only California and Arizona have such laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.divorcesupport.com/divorce/What-is-quot-quasi-community-property-quot--1298.html Divorce Support.com Divorce legal resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3085">The '''Congress of Soviets''' was the supreme governing body of the [[Russian SFSR|Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] and several other [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviet republics]] from 1917–36 and again from 1989-91. After the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|creation of the Soviet Union]], the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets of the USSR]] functioned as its legislative branch until its dissolution during 1936. Its initial full name was the "'''Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies'''. It was also known sometimes as the "'''Congress of People's Deputies'''."

==Russia and the Soviet Union {{anchor|RSFSR/USSR Congress of Soviets, 1917–1936}} ==
{{see also|All-Russian Congress of Soviets|Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union}}
The Congress of Soviets was an assembly of representatives of local councils.  In theory, it was the supreme power of the Soviet state, an organ of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. No [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], no noble, no aristocrat, no priest could vote – only [[proletariat|working people]]. Officially, the Congress of Soviets created laws and elected the [[Council of People's Commissars]], which was the government. In the interim its functions were performed by designated executive bodies, see [[VTsIK]]. In practice the Congress became increasingly deferential to the [[Bolsheviks]] after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, L. ''The Origin of the Communist Autocracy: Political Opposition in the Soviet State, First Phase, 1917-1922''. 1st ed. New York: Frederick A. Praeger Publishers, 1965. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of Lenin's death during 1924 the Congress of Soviets effectively only [[Rubber stamp (politics)|approved]] the decisions of the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik)|Communist Party]] and served as a [[propaganda]] assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, pp. 162-163.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1936 Soviet Constitution|1936 Constitution]] eliminated the Congress of Soviets, making the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] the legislative institution. During this time the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the AUCP(b)]] had [[de facto]] control of the government.

==Ukraine==
The [[Bolshevik]]s convened an [[All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets]] of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies in [[Kiev]], on December 17, 1917, and in Kharkiv on December 25, 1917 (see ''[[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution]]'').

== History and effects ==
The concept was first proposed in Italy. As per the law, the users were allowed to install the apps and services they require and remove others. The [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] supports installation of [[Third-party software component|third party]] software on the devices beyond the [[Google Play]] store whereas [[Apple Inc.]] restricts the third party installation of applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;This led to the callout{{clarify|date=March 2018}} of the news saying that the [[Senate Act 2484]] had potential to ban the use of [[iPhone]]s in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://boingboing.net/2017/06/24/reasonable-and-nondiscriminato.html|title=No, Italy isn't banning the iPhone|date=2017-06-24|work=Boing Boing|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users are allowed to attach any device to any network service that they subscribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sjordan/research/device%20attachment.html|title=Device Neutrality|website=www.ics.uci.edu|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Member of the [[Italian Parliament]] [[Stefano Quintarelli]] proposed a bill which states that users should have the right to use content and services irrespective of the devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/net-neutrality-could-become-law-in-italy-unless-internet-users-would-rather-opt-out/|title=Net neutrality could become law in Italy - unless internet users would rather opt out {{!}} ZDNet|last=Mastrolonardo|first=Raffaele|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term device neutrality is closely connected to [[net neutrality]], and shares a correlation. Net neutrality is a concept that ensures equal access to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/11/23/net-neutrality-explained-what-it-means-and-why-it-matters/|title=Net Neutrality Explained: What It Means (and Why It Matters)|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">'''Dissent aversion''' is the judicial phenomenon that implies that [[judge]]s do not like [[dissenting opinion]]s in the jurisdictions where they are possible nor do they like to dissent themselves. A common example is as follows: On a panel of three judges, only one feels strongly about the decision. One of the two remaining may side with the first judge, leaving the third judge with the option of dissenting on an issue they do not feel strongly about or siding with the majority.&lt;ref name=posner&gt;Posner, Richard A ''How Judges Think'' Harvard University Press 2007 pg 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Judges dislike dissent for many reasons. Dissent aversion can come from these sources:&lt;ref name=posner/&gt;
*It frays [[collegiality]] (judges have to work together in the future).
*It magnifies the [[majority opinion]].
*It is additional work.
*It detracts from the significance of their own majority opinions.

Dissent is more frequent in [[United States court of appeals|US federal courts of appeals]]{{vague|date=December 2016}} where the number of judges is higher.&lt;ref name=posner/&gt; According to some research, this is because the larger the court, the less frequently judges must work with each other and accordingly have less incentive to extend courtesy and favors.&lt;ref&gt;Stefanie Lindquist ''"Bureaucratization and Balkanization: The Origins and Effects of Decision Making Norm in the Federal Appellate Courts"''.&lt;!-- publisher? date of publication? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Equity and Reconciliation Commission''' ({{lang-ar|هيئة الإنصاف والمصالحة}}; [[French language|French]] ''Instance Equité et Réconciliation'' - IER) is a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] human rights and [[truth commission]] created on January 7, 2004 when [[Mohammed VI|King Mohammed VI]] signed a ''[[Moroccan Dahir|Dahir]]'' (royal [[decree]]). This [[Truth and reconciliation commission|truth commission]] was established to reconcile victims of human rights abuses, such as torture, [[forced disappearance]]s and [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrests]], committed by [[Makhzen]] (the governing elite) during the ''[[Years of Lead (Morocco)|Years of lead]]'', with the State. It covers 1956 to 1999, spanning the reign of the two previous monarchs. The proclaimed objectives of the commission were the protection and the promotion of the [[human rights in Morocco]]. 

The IER operated under a two-year mandate from 2004-2006 with a president and 16 commissioners, half of them from [[Conseil Consultatif des Droits de l'Homme|CCDH]]. The committee investigated approximately 20,000 cases, resulting in a number of recommendations to the state including: reparations (financial, psychological, medical and social), modification of the constitution, and ratification of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), among others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Truth Commission: Morocco|url = http://www.usip.org/publications/truth-commission-morocco|website = United States Institute of Peace|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission distributed $85 million USD within 18 months of the commission ending.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

IER aimed to rehabilitate the victims, and pay compensation for state outrages against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ictj.org/mena/morocco ''ICTJ Activity in Morocco'' - [[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been hailed internationally as a big step forward, and an example to the [[Arab world]]. 

However, the IER has also come under attack from parts of the human rights-community, since:
# its mission is not to reveal the identities of or prosecute human rights offenders, which most of the victims were requesting.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2005/morocco1105/6.htm#_Toc119468378 ''Morocco's Truth Commission: Honoring Past Victims during an Uncertain Present: V. Constraints on the ERC'' - [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW.org)]&lt;/ref&gt;
# it is not allowed to mention Mohammed's predecessor, King [[Hassan II]];
# it is not allowed to report about human rights violations since 1999, when [[Mohammed VI]] was enthroned.
# it cannot criticize the violation of freedom of speech, which according to human rights organisations still exists in Morocco. Nevertheless, author and truth commission expert [[Priscilla Hayner|Priscilla B. Hayner]], considers this commission one of the five strongest truth commissions ever.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Unspeakable Truths|last = Hayner|first = Priscilla|publisher = Routledge|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-415-80635-0|location = New York|pages = 42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IER completed its mandate by delivering its final report to the King of Morocco in December 2005.

==History and background==
[[File:LocationMorocco defacto.png|thumb|Map of Morocco]]

In 1955, Morocco gained independence from [[France]], becoming a free nation. It had previously been under French rule as a [[protectorate]], placed in this position under the auspice of the [[Scramble for Africa]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morocco|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mo.html|website=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-four years later, the newly independent Kingdom of Morocco began its rediscovered independence as a constitutional monarchy, headed by Sultan Mohammed V.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Morocco|title=Morocco {{!}} history - geography|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]] became King of Morocco, reorganizing the state to promote reform and growth, particularly in the legislature with the inclusion of representation for the indigenous population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, King Mohammed V soon feared opposition movements and reacted by violently quelling any dissenting groups or individuals. This was the beginning of forced "disappearances" and arbitrary arrests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While Mohammed V only ruled for five years before his death in 1961, his son, King [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hassan II]] came to power with an even heavier hand, that soon resulted in arbitrary rule. This period would become known as the "[[Years of Lead (Morocco)|Years of Lead]]".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After an opposition party won a small number of seats in the 1965 election, King Hassan II took complete control over the legislature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From this point on, forced disappearances, secret detention, arbitrary arrest, killings and forced exile of political opponents became common practices within the state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1975, the King repressed independent advocates located in the [[Western Sahara]] region, demonstrating the monarchy's fear of opposition movements.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

By 1990, the repression began to ease in response to pressure by domestic and international communities. King Hassan II appointed an Advisory Council on Human Rights (CCDH) to confront criticisms and to review the practices of the state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The goal of the CCDH was to investigate reports of human rights abuse and to begin adherence to international standards by recommending changes to Moroccan law and practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Advisory Council on Human Rights did make a number of changes, ultimately leading to the creation of the Independent Arbitration Panel in 1999. This panel was established by the new King, Mohammed VI, after the death of his father King Hassan II in 1999. The panel awarded $100 million USD in [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]] to almost 7, 000 recipients, but there was still a large amount of work to be completed within the state. For example, many victims were not included in the process, and the lack of transparency was greatly criticized.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2003, the CCDH recommended that a truth commission be created to continue expanding on the work completed by the CCDH and the Independent Arbitration Panel.

==Creation and mandate==
=== Creation ===
In 2003, the CCDH recommended that a truth commission be created to continue expanding on the work completed by the CCDH and the Independent Arbitration Panel. As a result of these abuses between 1956 and 1999, a truth commission was created by ''Dahir'' (royal decree) in early 2004 to investigate these abuses. The ''Dahir'' outlined the mandate of the commission as well as its general structure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Mandate ===
The Instance Équité et Réconciliation (IER) was given less than a two-year mandate, from April 2004 until January 2006.

The ultimate goal of the commission was to look specifically into forced disappearances and arbitrary detention between 1956 and 1999. From here, the commission was to include recommendations to the King regarding monetary compensation, psychological and medical care, social reintegration, and as Article 9.6 states, "recommend measures designed to memorialize the human rights violations, as well as to guarantee their non-repetition, remedy their effects, and restore confidence in the primacy of the law and respect for human rights."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/morocco1105wcover.pdf|title=Morocco's Truth Commission: Honoring Past Victims during an Uncertain Present|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2016|website=|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mandate of the commission was very clear in its lack of powers, both judicial and investigatory powers. The commission could not publicly name any one person of individual responsibility (except in the final report to the King), it did not have the power to subpoena or search and seizure, it had overall very limited investigatory powers, and its final recommendations were to be given to the king who would decide on how to proceed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, the IER was a strictly advisory body and the state was under no obligation to follow through with any of the recommendations made (except in the area of individual remuneration).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Within the mandate, it is specified that only forced disappearances and arbitrary detention that took place between 1956 and 1999 would be investigated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Significance ===
The Instance Équité et Réconciliation (IER) was an unprecedented truth commission for many reasons. First, the decree to proceed with the proposed mandate was made by the King of Morocco, a leader who inherited his power through hereditary rule. Second, the commission would be investigating acts undertaken by the current King's (Mohammed VI) late father and late grandfather, from whom he inherited his power. Third, there had been no abrupt change in power or government (as is common in truth commissions), but merely gradual reforms over a long period of time. For example, some of the government officials who were in power during the period of abuses, were still in power during the formation of the truth commission.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, when the original Advisory Council on Human Rights began in 1990, nine years before King Hassan II's death, it was an unusual action considering no drastic change in government or power. Finally, this was the first truth commission of the Arab world, and an unprecedented action within the region.

==Investigations and committees==
===Commissioners and committee members===
The Instance Équité et Réconciliation (IER) was composed of seventeen commissioners appointed by the King, all of them Moroccan nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ijr.org.za/img/trc/Morocco.pdf|title=Truth Commissions: A Comparative Study|last=Barkoukis|first=Leila|last2=Villa-Vicencio|first2=Charles|date=August 2011|website=Institute for Justice and Reconciliation|publisher=Conflict Resolution Program, Georgetown University and the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation|access-date=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the seventeen commissioners there were notable additions, including one woman and five former political prisoners, two who had been exiled. From these seventeen commissioners, eight were from the Advisory Council on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merip.org/mero/mero040405|title=Morocco’s Justice and Reconciliation Commission {{!}} Middle East Research and Information Project|website=www.merip.org|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man who headed the commission, [[Driss Benzekri (activist)|Driss Benzekri]], was both a former political prisoner and a prominent human rights activist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Benzekri was a former member of the Marxist–Leninist group [[Ila al-Amam (Morocco)|Ila al-Amam]] which had been outlawed by the state.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition to the seventeen commissioners, there was a paid staff of one hundred people, mostly working in the investigations and reparations divisions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Investigations ===
With less than a two-year mandate, the commission worked quickly and broke into three groups: investigations (which had six commissioners), reparations (which had seven commissioners), and the study and research group (which had three commissioners).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The goal of these working groups was to work efficiently and effectively in order to investigate the largest number of abuses.

The commission had an approximate total of 20,000 cases to investigate; 7,000 of those coming from the previous arbitration panel and the other 13,000 from an open call to the public for submissions at the beginning of its mandate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The investigations included victim hearings, archival research, as well as interviewing past and present government officials.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In its archival work, the IER worked with Moroccan [[civil society]] and human rights organizations in addition to victims and their families.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is reported that 10,000 people were interviewed by the Investigations Committee and approximately 40,000 pieces of correspondence concerning the investigations were received.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Commission held both public and private hearings. The private meetings were mostly composed of public officials involved in the abuses who did not want to be publicly exposed. The seven public hearings held were both welcomed by the public and criticized for the inability of victims to openly name their perpetrators (see Mandate, Criticisms). The format of the public hearings included ten victims (who were selected based on broad representation of victims) at each hearing who were given twenty minutes to speak about what they had suffered. No questions or responses were allowed and the audience could not emit any expressions of emotion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In order to reach as large an audience as possible, the IER decided to include a series of themed seminars which were broadcast on state TV during prime time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The topics are as follows: "Democratic Transition in Morocco," "Eliminating Violence as a Means of Governing," "Political, Economic, and Social Reform," "Cultural and Educational Reform," and "Legislative, Executive and Judiciary Reform."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Findings ==
In December 2005, the commission submitted its final report to King Mohammed VI outlining both its findings and recommendations related to the abuses that took place between 1956 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Sonja Hegasy, Bettina Dennerlein: [http://www.zmo.de/Mitarbeiter/Hegasy/PDF/Dennerlein%20und%20Hegasy.pdf Die marokkanische Wahrheitskommission zwischen Politik und Geschichte]. In: Christoph Marx (Hrsg.): Bilder nach dem Sturm. Periplus-Studien, Münster, p 102-121.&lt;/ref&gt; Per the original mandate, certain aspects of the commission's final report could not be made public. Therefore, upon completion of the report, the King then determined which information could be used in the publicly issued report, released one month later in January 2006. However, the IER did create an archive containing all the evidence collected in its investigations which could be used at a later date during judicial proceedings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Ultimately, the commission concluded that 742 disappeared individuals had died, thus determining their fate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there was a lack of information on burial sites and circumstances of the disappeared persons' deaths and 66 cases were not solved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Of all the cases presented, ultimately 4,677 cases were resolved, including reparations for 3,657 victims.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; From the investigations, an archive of over 20,000 personal testimonies has been created.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Recommendations ==
The IER made a number of recommendations to the state, including a variety of government reforms. These included:
* Continue the investigations started by the IER by going further in depth&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Reform both the security sector and the judicial sector, including the creation of an independent judiciary&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* Modify the Constitution to guarantee specific rights, particularly human rights&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Authorize reparations: financial, psychological, medical, social&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Ratify the International Criminal Court (ICC) Rome Statute, including the abolition of the death penalty&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Have the state take responsibility for the abuses including disappearances, arbitrary detention, torture and excessive use of force&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Reduce executive powers, strengthen the legislature&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* Detailed recommendations in certain areas: "gender equality, community mediation, poverty reduction, the normalization of legal status, continuing education and professional development, medical and psychological rehabilitation and memorials"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Implementation  ==
Overall, the commission was received as a positive step towards a stronger and more democratic Morocco after a tumultuous, repressive and abusive period in its history. From the outset, the ''Dahir'' (royal decree) to begin the commission was unprecedented and very well looked upon. The quick response to implement financial reparations was received extremely well; within 18 months, the commission had distributed $85 million USD to between 9,000 and 16,000 individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally the government began the development of a community reparations programs, which included the cooperation of 250 organizations, both governmental and non-governments.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ictj.org/publication/truth-and-reconciliation-morocco|title=Truth and Reconciliation in Morocco|website=International Center for Transitional Justice|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, the government had distributed $2.57 million USD to various communities across Morocco as a part of this program.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, various ministries and agencies signed agreements to provide medical care and vocational training at no cost to the victims and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ictj.org/sites/default/files/ICTJ-Morocco-TRC-2009-English.pdf|title=Truth and Reconciliation in Morocco|last=|first=|date=|website=International Center for Transnational Justice: Morocco|publisher=International Center for Transnational Justice|access-date=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the recommendations made towards the constitution, the King endorsed the recommendations of the commission and stated the intention for the recommendations to be included in a revised draft constitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2011, a newly drafted constitution was created (largely in response to the Arab Spring), incorporating the recommended human rights, however, there remain certain restrictions in place.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.idea.int/publications/the_2011_moroccan_constitution/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;pageid=56782|title=The 2011 Moroccan Constitution: A Critical Analysis|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2016|website=International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance|publisher=International IDEA|access-date=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the commission resulted in positive change in Morocco, including greater transparency, truth of the past abuses, and the ability for the country to begin a long healing process.

== Criticism ==
While the commission was generally received as a positive step towards a strong and more democratic Morocco, various criticisms with the commission and its aftereffects arose.

From the beginning, the mandate's time frame was criticized, as it only included abuses up until the death of the previous monarch. Some critics wanted post-1999 abuses to be included in the commission as well.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As stated in the mandate, the IER had no judicial powers and could not name any perpetrators. Organizations like [[Human Rights Watch]] have criticized this aspect of the truth commission and the Moroccan state more generally for ensuring judicial actions are not taken against perpetrators, no matter the crime committed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While Benzekri is quoted as noting accountability changes in the government, particularly the removal of certain officials from their posts, the public officials were not named, were not charged with any crime or action and not all officials with proven connections to the abuses were removed, due to concerns over government stability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Similar to many commissions, there is nothing stopping victims from trying to hold their perpetrators accountable through the public court system, however this is a risk for many people as judicial independence is widely questioned.

The limit placed on the definition of victim, as only those who were subjects of enforced disappearance or arbitrary detention, was also criticized.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By only including two main areas of abuses, the mandate was considerably minimized and many cases were rejected due to this. In addition, compensation would be not included for abuses which were not considered systematic.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As explicitly outlined, the IER had no powers of subpoena and could not compel any cooperation. This resulted in various individuals or groups withholding crucial information, such as the documents and testimonies needed of many security service agents.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Instead, the commission was informed that the king would support the commission and ensure cooperation of the authorities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The final report did not mention Western Sahara, which was one of the most repressed regions in the state. Additionally, the commission only visited the region for a period of ten days and plans for a public hearing in the region were ultimately cancelled.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Since the report's release in 2006, very few of the recommendations have been acted on, and those actions that were taken were done extremely slowly. To date, no trials have taken place and the government has yet to ratify the [[International Criminal Court]] statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pgaction.org/campaigns/icc/me-med/morocco.html|title=Morocco - Middle East and the Mediterranean|website=www.pgaction.org|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{UStaxation}}
In the [[United States]], an '''excess profits tax''' is a tax, some say [[excise tax]], on any [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] above a certain amount. A predominantly wartime fiscal instrument, the tax was designed primarily to capture wartime profits that exceeded normal peacetime profits to prevent [[perverse incentive]]s for manufacturers to engage in [[war profiteering]] and warmongering.{{According to whom|date=August 2018}}

In 1863 the Confederate congress and the state of Georgia experimented with excess profits taxes, perhaps, the first time it has happened in American history. 
==20th century==
===United Kingdom===
In Great Britain in World War I, the Treasury rejected proposals for a stiff capital levy, which the Labour Party wanted to use to weaken the capitalists. Instead, there was an excess profits tax, of 50 percent of profits above the normal prewar level; the rate was raised to 80 percent in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Arnold, "‘A paradise for profiteers’? The importance and treatment of profits during the First World War." ''Accounting History Review'' 24#2-3 (2014): 61-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Billings and Lynne Oats, "Innovation and pragmatism in tax design: Excess Profits Duty in the UK during the First World War." ''Accounting History Review'' 24#2-3 (2014): 83-101. &lt;/ref&gt;  Excise taxes were added on luxury imports such as automobiles, clocks and watches. There was no sales tax or value added tax at this time in Britain.

===United States===
The first effective American excess profits tax was enacted in 1917, with rates graduated from 20 to 60 percent on the profits of all businesses in excess of prewar earnings but not less than 7 percent or more than 9 percent of invested capital. In 1918 a national law limited the tax to corporations and increased the rates. Concurrent with this 1918 tax, the federal government imposed, for the year 1918 only, an alternative tax, ranging up to 80 percent, with the taxpayer paying whichever was higher. In 1921 the excess profits tax was repealed despite powerful attempts to make it permanent. In 1933 and 1935 Congress enacted two mild excess profits taxes as supplements to a capital stock tax.

The crisis of [[World War II]] led Congress to pass four excess profits statutes between 1940 and 1943. The 1940 rates ranged from 25 to 50 percent and the 1941 ones from 35 to 60 percent. In 1942 a flat rate of 90 percent was adopted, with a postwar refund of 10 percent; in 1943 the rate was increased to 95 percent, with a 10 percent refund. Congress gave corporations two alternative excess profits tax credit choices: either 95 percent of average earnings for 1936–1939 or an invested capital credit, initially 8 percent of capital but later graduated from 5 to 8 percent. In 1945 Congress repealed the tax, effective 1 January 1946. The Korean War induced Congress to reimpose an excess profits tax, effective from 1 July 1950 to 31 December 1953. The tax rate was 30 percent of excess profits with the top [[corporate tax]] rate rising from 45% to 47%, a 70 percent ceiling for the combined corporation and excess profits taxes.

In 1991 some members of Congress sought unsuccessfully to pass an excess profits tax of 40 percent upon the larger oil companies as part of energy policy.
Some social reformers have championed a peacetime use of the excess profits tax, but such proposals face strong opposition from businesses and some economists, who argue that it would create a disincentive to capital investment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3924">[[File:'Le voeu du faisan' Rijksmuseum SK-A-4212.jpeg|thumb|350px|Anonymous sixteenth-century painting showing participants of the Feast of the Pheasant]]
The '''Feast of the Pheasant''' ([[French language|French]]: '''''Banquet du Voeu du Faisan''''', "Banquet of the Oath of the Pheasant") was a banquet given by [[Philip the Good]], Duke of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] on 17 February 1454 in [[Lille]], now in France.  Its purpose was to promote a [[crusade]] against the [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|Turks]], who had taken [[Constantinople]] the year before.  The crusade never took place.

There are contemporary accounts of the banquet (notably the ''Memoirs'' of [[Olivier de la Marche]], and the ''Chroniques'' of [[Mathieu d'Escouchy]]), which name and describe in much detail the lavish entertainments staged during the meal and various pieces of music performed at it, perhaps including [[Guillaume Dufay|Dufay]]'s [[motet]] ''[[Lamentatio sanctae matris ecclesiae Constantinopolitanae]]''.&lt;ref name="Spechtler"&gt;Spechtler, Franz Viktor: Lyrik des ausgehenden 14. und des 15. Jahrhunderts. Rodopi, 1984, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; At one point in the show, according to the chronicles, an actor dressed as a woman in white satin clothes, personifying the
[[Church of Constantinople]] (according to one hypothesis, played by Olivier de la Marche himself&lt;ref&gt;Edmund A. Bowles, ''Instruments at the Court of Burgundy (1363-1467)'', ''The Galpin Society Journal'', Vol. 6, (July 1953), pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;) entered the hall of the banquet riding on an elephant, led by a giant [[Saracen]], to recite a "complaint and lamentation in a piteous and feminine voice" (''"commença sa complainte et lamentacion à voix piteuse et femmenine"''), requesting aid from the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Knights of the Golden Fleece]].  It has been surmised&lt;ref&gt;Whitwell, David: On music of the courts of Burgundy. [www.whitwellessays.com/docs/DOC_565.doc]&lt;/ref&gt; that this was the moment when Dufay's motet would have been performed; other authors have conjectured that it was merely a moment of inspiration and that the motet was actually written later.&lt;ref&gt;F. Alberto Gallo, ''Music of the Middle Ages II'', translated by Karen Eales. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985. p. 104, proposes it was written a year later; Spechtler (''op.cit.'') merely states the time and context of its composition is unknown.&lt;/ref&gt;

We are also told which music by [[Gilles Binchois]] was performed and of 24 musicians playing inside an enormous pie and a trick with a horse riding backwards. 

The oath taken by the participants, the ''Vœux du faisan'' ("oath of the [[pheasant]]") was in the tradition of the "bird oaths" of [[Late Medieval France]] as popularized in the 14th century romance of the ''[[Voeux du paon]]''.

{{italic title}}
'''''Fleta''''' is a treatise, written in [[Latin]], with the sub-title '''''seu Commentarius juris Anglicani''''', on the [[common law]] of England. The anonymous author of the book is sometimes referred to as "Fleta", although this is not in fact a person's name.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; The book acquired its common title because its preface contains a remark that it could be called "''Fleta''" as it was written in "Fleta": however, the meaning of this comment is unclear (see '''Authorship''' below).

From internal evidence, the work appears to have been written in the reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], and to have been completed shortly after the year 1290.&lt;ref&gt;Sayles 1984, pp. xii–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authority==
This book is one of those listed by Blackstone as being [[Books of authority|authoritative statements of the law at the time at which they were written]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', Book I, page 72 [https://books.google.com/books?id=DVkzAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=blackstone&amp;as_brr=1#PPA72,M1 1791 Ed.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Coke]] cites Fleta as authority in his [[Institutes of the Lawes of England|''Institutes'']] in a number of places.{{Quantify|date=March 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;Search of the PDF copies on [[Google Book Search]] on 11 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The article on ''Fleta'' in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' says that it "is for the most part a poor imitation of" ''[[De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae]]'' by [[Henry de Bracton]]. [[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]] described it as an "epitome of" that book.&lt;ref&gt;''A First Book of English Law'', Sweet and Maxwell, 4th Ed, 1960, p. 188, footnote 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[G. O. Sayles]] was able to show that the author of ''Fleta'' had a copy of Bracton to hand, but that (like other copies) it was defective in places, and that he was obliged to make many additions and improvements of his own.&lt;ref&gt;Sayles 1984, pp. xiv–xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' describes ''Fleta'' as "updating and abridging" Bracton.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Seipp 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscript copies==
One complete [[manuscript]] copy of this book survives from the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;This date for the manuscript is given by the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 1889&lt;/ref&gt; It is held by the [[British Library]] where its reference is BL, [[Cotton library|Cotton]] MS Julius B.viii. A few passages of this book also survive in another manuscript. This is also held by the British Library, where its reference is BL, [[Cotton library|Cotton]] MS Nero D.vi.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sayles 1984, pp. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circulation==
Because few copies survive, it is thought that this book was "not widely read by medieval lawyers."&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Authorship==
It has often been assumed that the statement that the book was "written in ''Fleta''" means that it was written during the author's confinement in the [[Fleet prison]]. It has been conjectured that the author was one of those judges who were imprisoned for malpractices by Edward I.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noël Denholm-Young]] and Paul Brand have proposed as an alternative candidate one Matthew of the Exchequer, a [[yeoman]] of the royal household and lawyer, who was convicted of forgery in 1290 and committed to the Fleet for two years.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sayles 1984, pp. xxiv–xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the element "fleet" (meaning both "swift" and "a watercourse") is also found in other place names in England; or the name might simply refer to the swiftness or brevity of the treatise itself.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Editions==
The first printed edition of ''Fleta'' was published by [[John Selden]] in 1647. It included a dissertation written by Selden, the title of which is "Joannis Seldeni ad Fletam dissertatio". A second edition was published, with corrections, in 1685. A new edition of the first of the six books of ''Fleta'' was published in 1735, edited by [[Thomas Clarke (judge)|Thomas Clarke]], a future [[Master of the Rolls]]: however, he published no more. The next edition appeared in France in 1776, edited by [[David Hoüard]]: this was based on the previous printed editions, and was abridged in places. All these editions are regarded, for various reasons, as imperfect.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sayles 1984, pp. ix–xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard modern edition (with English translation) was edited by H. G. Richardson and [[G. O. Sayles]], and published in three volumes by the [[Selden Society]] between 1955 and 1984. A projected fourth volume, intended to include editorial apparatus (notes and indexes), never appeared: this would have been nominally volume 1, and so the three published volumes are numbered 2–4. Volume 4 does include a 17-page "Introduction" by Sayles, which represents the fullest synopsis of scholarly knowledge about the work to date.

==Derivative book==
The book known as ''[[Britton (law)|Britton]]'' was based on this book.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sayles 1984, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 3 of the APA, as enacted in 1946, gave agencies broad discretion concerning the publication of governmental records. Following concerns that the provision had become more of a withholding than a disclosure mechanism, Congress amended the section in 1966 as a standalone act to implement "a general philosophy of full agency disclosure." The amendment required agencies to publish their rules of procedure in the ''[[Federal Register]]'', 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1)(C), and to make available for public inspection and copying their opinions, statements of policy, interpretations, and staff manuals and instructions that are not published in the Federal Register, § 552(a)(2). In addition, § 522(a)(3) requires every agency, "upon any request for records which ... reasonably describes such records" to make such records "promptly available to any person." If an agency improperly withholds any documents, the district court has jurisdiction to order their production. Unlike the review of other agency action that must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary or capricious, FOIA expressly places the burden "on the agency to sustain its action," and directs the district courts to "determine the matter de novo."

The Federal Government's Freedom of Information Act should not be confused with the different and varying [[Freedom of information in the United States|Freedom of Information Acts passed by the individual states]]. Many of those state acts may be similar but not identical to the federal act.

== Background ==
With the ongoing stress on both constitutional and inherent rights of American citizens and the added assertion of government subservience to the individual, some, particularly representative [[John E. Moss|John Moss]], thought that it was necessary for government information to be available to the public. This push built on existing principles and protocols of government administration already in place.

Others, though—most notably President Lyndon B. Johnson—believed that certain types of unclassified government information should nonetheless remain secret. Notwithstanding the White House's opposition, Congress expanded Section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act as a standalone measure in 1966 to further standardize the publication of government records, consistent with the belief that the people have the "right to know" about them. The [[Privacy Act of 1974]] was passed as a countervailing measure to ensure the security of government documents increasingly kept on private citizens.

The FOIA was put in place shortly after the illegal unconstitutional act of [[Project MKUltra]] performed by the CIA, which most of the evidence was burned and some of the surviving documents became classified in 2001.

== Scope ==
The act explicitly applies only to executive branch government agencies. These agencies are under several mandates to comply with public solicitation of information. Along with making public and accessible all bureaucratic and technical procedures for applying for documents from that agency, agencies are also subject to penalties for hindering the process of a petition for information. If "agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to the withholding, [a] Special Counsel shall promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against the officer or employee who was primarily responsible for the withholding."&lt;ref name='III'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/oip/ |title=U.S. Department of Justice Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) General Information |accessdate=2010-01-03 |author=Office of Information and Privacy (OIP) |date=2005-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, there is recourse for one seeking information to go to a federal court if suspicion of illegal tampering or delayed sending of records exists. However, there are nine exemptions, ranging from a withholding "specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy" and "trade secrets" to "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy."&lt;ref name=III /&gt; The nine current exemptions to the FOIA address issues of sensitivity and personal rights.

The [[Postal Reorganization Act]] of 1970 (at {{USC|39|410(c)(2)}}) exempts the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) from disclosure of "information of a commercial nature, including trade secrets, whether or not obtained from a person outside the Postal Service, which under good business practice would not be publicly disclosed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USPS: ZIP Codes are "Commercially Sensitive" Trade Secrets|date=November 6, 2013|accessdate=7 November 2013|publisher=The WebLaws.org Blog|url=http://www.weblaws.org/blog/2013/11/usps-zip-codes-are-commercially-sensitive-trade-secrets/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The law came about because of the determination of Congressman [[John E. Moss]] of California. Moss was the chairman of the Government Information Subcommittee. It took Moss 12 years to get the Freedom of Information Act through Congress successfully.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Gold, Susan Dudley. 2012. ''Freedom of Information Act''. New York, NY: Marshall Cavendish Benchmark.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the desire for government transparency stemmed from the Department of Defense and Congressional committees evaluation of the nation's classification system in the late 1950s. They determined that the misuse of government classification of documents was causing insiders to leak documents that were marked "confidential." The committee also determined that the lowest rung of the confidentiality ladder "confidential" should be removed. They deemed that "secret" and "top secret" covered National security adequately.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Moss Committee took it upon itself to reform confidentiality policy and implement punishments for the overuse of classification by officials and departments.

The FOIA has been changed repeatedly by both the legislative and executive branches.

=== Initial enactment ===
The Freedom of Information Act was initially introduced as the bill {{USBill|89|S|1160}} in the 89th Congress. When the two-page bill was signed into law it became {{USStatute|89|487|80|250|1966|07|04}}, but had an effective date of one year after the date of enactment, or July 4, 1967. The law set up the structure of FOIA as we know it today.

That law was initially repealed. During the period between the enactment of the act and its effective date, [[Title 5 of the United States Code]] was enacted into positive law.&lt;ref&gt;The enactment of Title 5 into positive law was done by {{USStatute|89|554|80|378|1966|09|06}}. This means that while Title 5 existed before, it was merely a compilation of laws but not the law itself. Only about half of the U.S. Code is positive law, meaning the law itself. See [http://uscode.house.gov/codification/legislation.shtml uscode.house.gov] for background on positive law codifiation of the U.S. Code.&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons now unclear but which may have had to do with the way the enactment of Title 5 changed how the law being amended was supposed to be cited, the original Freedom of Information Act was replaced. A new act in {{USStatute|90|23|81|54|1967|06|05}} (originally {{USBill|90|HR|5357}} in the 90th Congress), repealed the original and put in its place a substantively identical law. This statute was signed on June 5, 1967, and had the same effective date as the original statute: July 4, 1967.

=== Privacy Act Amendments of 1974 ===
Following the [[Watergate scandal]], President [[Gerald R. Ford]] wanted to sign FOIA-strengthening amendments in the [[Privacy Act of 1974]], but [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and deputy [[Dick Cheney]] were concerned about leaks.&lt;ref name=GWU&gt;{{cite web |title=Veto Battle 30 Years Ago Set Freedom of Information Norms: Scalia, Rumsfeld, Cheney Opposed Open Government Bill; Congress Overrode President Ford's Veto of Court Review |work=Electronic Briefing Book No. 142 |publisher=National Security Archive (George Washington University, Washington, D.C.) |date=2004-11-23 |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB142/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistant Attorney General for the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] [[Antonin Scalia]] advised the bill was unconstitutional and even telephoned the CIA asking them to lobby a particular White House staffer.&lt;ref name=GWU/&gt;  President Ford was persuaded to veto the bill on October 17, 1974, according to documents [[declassification|declassified]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=GWU/&gt;  However, on November 21, the lame-duck Congress overrode President Ford's veto, giving the United States the core Freedom of Information Act still in effect today, with judicial review of executive secrecy claims.&lt;ref name=GWU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum for President Ford from Ken Cole, "H.R. 12471, Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act," September 25, 1974 Source: Gerald R. Ford Library. Document 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scalia remained highly critical of the 1974 amendments, writing years later that "It is the Taj Mahal of the Doctrine of Unanticipated Consequences, the Sistine Chapel of Cost-Benefit Analysis Ignored."&lt;ref name=Scalia&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scalia|first1=Antonin|title=The Freedom of Information Act Has No Clothes|journal=Regulation|date=March 1982|volume=6|issue=2|page=14|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/1982/3/v6n2-3.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scalia particularly disliked the availability of judicial review, decrying that if "an agency denies a freedom of information request, shazam!—the full force of the Third Branch of the government is summoned to the wronged party's assistance."&lt;ref name=Scalia /&gt;

These amendments that these FOIA regulate government control of documents which concern a citizen. It gives one "(1) the right to see records about [one]self, subject to the Privacy Act's exemptions, (2) the right to amend that record if it is inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete, and (3) the right to sue the government for violations of the statute including permitting others to see [one's] records unless specifically permitted by the Act."&lt;ref name=V&gt;{{cite book|title=Your Right to Federal Records: Questions and Answers on the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act|publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center|year=1992 |url=http://www.epic.org/open_gov/rights.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with the FOIA, the PA is used to further the rights of an individual gaining access to information held by the government. The Justice Department's Office of Information and Privacy and federal district courts are the two channels of appeal available to seekers of information.&lt;ref name=I&gt;{{cite book|last=Theoharis|first=Athan|authorlink=Athan Theoharis|title=A Culture of Secrecy: The Government Versus the People's Right to Know|publisher=Kansas: University Press of Kansas |year=1998 |page=27|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1976 Government in the Sunshine Act amendments ===
In 1976, as part of the [[Government in the Sunshine Act]], Exemption 3 of the FOIA was amended so that several exemptions were specified:
#Information relating to national defense,
#Related solely to internal personnel rules and practices,
#Related to accusing a person of a crime,
#Related to information where disclosure would constitute a [[breach of privacy]],
#Related to investigatory records where the information would harm the proceedings,
#Related to information which would lead to financial speculation or endanger the stability of any financial institution, and
#Related to the agency's participation in legal proceedings.

=== 1982 Executive Order limiting the FOIA ===
Between 1982 and 1995, President Reagan's {{Executive Order| 12356}} allowed federal agencies to withhold enormous amounts of information under Exemption 1(relating to national security information), claiming it would better protect the country and strengthen national security.&lt;ref&gt;Exec. Order No. 12356, 3 C.F.R. 166 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcry from the effect that the Reagan Order had on FOIA requests was a factor in leading President Clinton to dramatically alter the criteria in 1995.&lt;ref name="Reagan"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brief Amici Curiae of The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the Society of Professional Journalists in support of Leslie R.

Weatherhead, Respondent, in the Supreme Court of the United States |date=1999-11-19 |url=http://www.rcfp.org/news/documents/weatherhead.html#III}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1986 Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act amendments to the FOIA ===
The FOIA amendments were a small part of the bipartisan [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986]]. Congress amended FOIA to address the fees charged by different categories of requesters and the scope of access to law enforcement and national security records. The amendments are not referenced in the congressional reports on the Act, so the floor statements provide an indication of Congressional intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FOIA Reform Legislation Enacted: FOIA Update Vol. VII, No. 4 |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_VII_4/page1.htm |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1995–99 expansion ===
Between 1995 and 1999, President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] issued executive directives (and amendments to the directives) that allowed the release of previously classified national security documents more than 25 years old and of historical interest, as part of the FOIA.&lt;ref name="Clinton"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) |publisher=Illinois Institute of Technology Paul V. Galvin Library|accessdate=2002-06-04 |url=http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/foia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This release of information allowed many previously publicly unknown details about the [[Cold War]] and other historical events to be discussed openly.&lt;ref name="Reagan"/&gt;

=== Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 ===
The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 (E-FOIA) stated that all agencies are required by statute to make certain types of records, created by the agency on or after November 1, 1996, available electronically. Agencies must also provide electronic reading rooms for citizens to use to have access to records. Given the large volume of records and limited resources, the amendment also extended the agencies' required response time to FOIA requests. Formerly, the response time was ten days and the amendment extended it to twenty business days.&lt;ref name="usdoj.gov" /&gt;

=== 2001 Executive Order limiting the FOIA ===
[[Executive Order 13233]], drafted by [[Alberto R. Gonzales]] and issued by President [[George W. Bush]] on November 1, 2001, restricted access to the records of former presidents.

This order was revoked on January 21, 2009, as part of President [[Barack Obama]]'s {{ExecutiveOrder|13489}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Executive Order no. 13489, Presidential Records'', {{Federal Register|74|4669}} (January 21, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Public access to presidential records was restored to the original extent of five years (12 for some records) outlined in the [[Presidential Records Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/obama/presidential.html|title=Executive Order 13489 on Presidential Records|work=fas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelligence Authorization Act of 2002 amending the FOIA ===
In 2002, Congress passed the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, {{USPL|107|306}}.&lt;ref name="IAA"&gt;{{cite web |title=FOIA Post: FOIA Amended by Intelligence Authorization Act|publisher=United States Department of Justice Office of Information and Privacy|year=2002|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foiapost/2002foiapost38.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this [[Omnibus bill|omnibus]] legislation were amendments to the FOIA (pertaining mainly to intelligence agencies) entitled "Prohibition on Compliance with Requests for Information Submitted by Foreign Governments":&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|107|306}}, {{USStat|116|2383}}, § 312 (to be codified at {{uscsub|5|552|a|3|A}}, {{uscsub|5|552|a|3|E}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Section 552(a)(3) of title 5, United States Code, is amended—

(1) in subparagraph (A) by inserting "and except as provided in subparagraph (E)", after "of this subsection"; and

(2) by adding at the end the following:

:(E) An agency, or part of an agency, that is an element of the intelligence community (as that term is defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 ({{uscsub|50|401a|4}})) shall not make any record available under this paragraph to—
::(i) any government entity, other than a State, territory, commonwealth, or district of the United States, or any subdivision thereof; or
::(ii) a representative of a government entity described in clause (i).}}

In effect, this new language precluded any covered U.S. intelligence agency from disclosing records in response to FOIA requests made by foreign governments or international governmental organizations. By its terms, it prohibits disclosure in response to requests made by such non-U.S. governmental entities either directly or through a "representative".&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|5|552|a|3|E|ii}} (as amended)&lt;/ref&gt; This means that for any FOIA request that by its nature appears as if it might have been made by or on behalf of a non-U.S. governmental entity, a covered agency may inquire into the particular circumstances of the requester in order to properly implement this new FOIA provision.&lt;ref name="IAA"/&gt;

The agencies affected by this amendment are those that are part of, or contain "an element of", the "intelligence community". As defined in the National Security Act of 1947 (as amended), they consist of the CIA, the National Security Agency, the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], the [[National Geospatial‐Intelligence Agency#National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA)|National Imagery and Mapping Agency]], the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (and certain other reconnaissance offices within the Department of Defense), the intelligence elements of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps, the FBI, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Energy, and the Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research in the Department of State, and "such other elements of any other department or agency as may be designated by the President, or designated jointly by the Director of Central Intelligence and the head of the department or agency concerned, as an element of the intelligence community".&lt;ref name="IAA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|50|401a|4}} (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== OPEN Government Act of 2007 ===
President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] signed the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007, {{USPL|110|175}}, on December 31, 2007.  This law, also known as the "OPEN Government Act of 2007", amended the federal FOIA statute in several ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ175.110 |title=Public Law 110-175 OPENNESS PROMOTES EFFECTIVENESS IN OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2007 |publisher=Government Printing Office |accessdate=2010-06-13 |date=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a White House press release, it does so by:
#establishing a definition of "a representative of the news media;"
#directing that required attorney fees be paid from an agency's own appropriation rather than from the Judgment Fund;
#prohibiting an agency from assessing certain fees if it fails to comply with FOIA deadlines; and
#establishing an Office of Government Information Services (OGIS)&lt;ref name="archives.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ogis.archives.gov/?p=//ogis/index.html|title=OGIS Home Page|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] to review agency compliance with FOIA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/news/2007/12/wh123107.html President Bush Signs S. 2488 into Law ] FAS Project on Government Secrecy&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes include the following:
* it recognizes electronic media specifically and defines "News Media" as "any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience."
*it extends the 20-day deadline by allowing for up to 10 days between the FOIA office of the agency and the component of the agency holding the records and specifically allows for clarification of requests by the FOIA office (Effective 12/31/2007).
*it calls for each agency to designate a FOIA Public Liaison, "who shall assist in the resolution of any disputes" (Effective 12/31/2008).
* it requires agencies to assign tracking numbers to FOIA requests that take longer than 10 days, and to provide systems determining the status of a request.
* it codifies and defines annual reporting requirements for each agency's FOIA program.
* it specifically addresses data sources used to generate reports; "shall make the raw statistical data used in its reports available electronically ..."
* it redefines the definition of an agency "record" to include information held for an agency by a government contractor.
* it establishes an Office of Government Information Services (OGIS)&lt;ref name="archives.gov"/&gt; which will offer mediation services to resolve disputes as non-exclusive alternative to litigation.
* it requires agencies to make recommendations personnel matters related to FOIA such as whether FOIA performance should be used as a merit factor.
* it requires agencies to specify the specific exemption for each deletion or [[redaction]] in disclosed documents.

=== 2009 Executive Order permitting retroactive classification ===
On December 29, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] issued [[Executive Order 13526]], which allows the government to classify certain specific types of information relevant to [[national security]] after it has been requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/eo/eo-13526.htm|title=Executive Order 13526|publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a request for information that meets the criteria for availability under FOIA can still be denied if the government determines that the information should have been classified, and unavailable. It also sets a timeline for automatic declassification of old information that is not specifically identified as requiring continued secrecy.

=== 2010 repeal of FOIA amendments in Wall Street reform act ===
The [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], signed into law in July 2010, included provisions in section 929I&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcfp.org/newsitems/index.php?i=11561|title=House holds hearing on controversial SEC FOIA exemption|work=rcfp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/section-929i-guidance.htm Guidance to Staff on Application of Section 929I of the Dodd-Frank Act] (modified: September 15, 2010) from the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; that shielded the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) from requests under the Freedom of Information Act.  The provisions were initially motivated out of concern that the FOIA would hinder SEC investigations that involved [[trade secret]]s of financial companies, including "watch lists" they gathered about other companies, trading records of investment managers, and "trading algorithms" used by investment firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/09/16/news/economy/schapiro_sec/index.htm|title=Schapiro explains why some info should be secret |date=September 16, 2010|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, the [[111th Congress]] passed an act repealing those provisions.  The act was introduced in the Senate on August 5, 2010 as S.3717&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|S|3717|pipe=Bill Summary &amp; Status- 111th Congress (2009–2010) S.3717}} from [[THOMAS]] at the [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; and given the name "A bill to amend the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]], and the [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]] to provide for certain disclosures under section 552 of title 5, United States Code, (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), and for other purposes."

== Notable cases ==
A major issue in released documentation is government "redaction" of certain passages deemed applicable to the Exemption section of the FOIA. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) officers in charge of responding to FOIA requests "so heavily redacted the released records as to preclude needed research."&lt;ref name=I /&gt; This has also brought into question just how one can verify that they have been given complete records in response to a request.

=== J. Edgar Hoover ===
[[File:Lennon FBI Files Before HQ-11p1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Document with some text blacked out.|Freedom of Information Act requests have led to the release of information such as this letter by J. Edgar Hoover about surveillance of ex-Beatle [[John Lennon]]. A 25-year battle by historian [[Jon Wiener]] based on FOIA, with the assistance of lawyers from the [[ACLU]], eventually resulted in the release of documents like this one.]] 
This trend of unwillingness to release records was especially evident in the process of making public the FBI files on [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. Of the 164 files and about eighteen thousand pages collected by the FBI, two-thirds were withheld from [[Athan G. Theoharis]] and plaintiff, most notably one entire folder entitled the "White House Security Survey." Despite finding out that the Truman Library had an accessible file which documented all the reports of this folder, the FBI and Office of Information and Privacy put forth "stony resistance" to the FOIA appeal process. (I–pg. 27) Some{{Who|date=July 2013}} argue that it was not even this sixteen year series of three appeals to the Justice Department which gained a further opening of the files, but rather the case of ''[[Department of Justice v. Landano]]'' which spurred on a break in stolid FBI opposition.

=== Murder trial ===
A murder trial decided in 1993, ''[[Department of Justice v. Landano]]'', {{Ussc|508|165|1993|el=no}}, involved what was alleged to be a felony murder committed during a group burglary by defendant Landano. Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] wrote the unanimous opinion. "In an effort to support his claim in subsequent state court proceedings that the prosecution violated ''[[Brady v. Maryland]]'', {{Ussc|373|83|1963|el=no}}, by withholding material exculpatory evidence, he filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the FBI for information it had compiled in connection with the murder investigation."&lt;ref name=IV&gt;''United States Dep't of Justice v. Landano'', {{Ussc|373|83|1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In defense, the FBI put forth a claim that the redacted sections of the documents requested were withheld in accordance with FOIA regulations protecting the identity of informants who gave information regarding case details. However, O'Connor ruled that those who supplied information had no need to remain anonymous in the court setting. "To the extent that the Government's proof may compromise legitimate interests, the Government still can attempt to meet its burden with in camera affidavits." The court thus remanded the case to the Circuit Courts and rejected the FBI's claim of confidentiality as being a valid reason to withhold information.

"While most individual sources may expect confidentiality, the Government offers no explanation, other than administrative ease, why that expectation always should be presumed."&lt;ref name=IV /&gt; Thus, when Theoharis and company were in the middle of fighting in court to obtain J. Edgar Hoover files, they may well have benefited from ''Landano'' and also [[Janet Reno]]'s assertions of the government's need for "greater openness" and "discretionary releases" in 1993.

=== E-mail ===
In the case of ''Scott Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, et al.'', the [[White House]] used the [[OfficeVision|PROFS]]&lt;ref name=I /&gt; computer communications software. With encryption designed for secure messaging, PROFS notes concerning the [[Iran–Contra affair]] (arms-for-hostages) under the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] Administration were insulated. However, they were also backed up and transferred to paper memos. The National Security Council, on the eve of President [[George H.W. Bush]]'s inauguration, planned to destroy these records. The [[National Security Archive]], Armstrong's association for the preservation of government historical documents, obtained an injunction in Federal District Court against the head, John Fawcett, of the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] and the National Security Council's purging of PROFS records. A Temporary Restraining Order was approved by Senior U.S. District Court Judge Barrington D. Parker. Suit was filed at District Court under Judge Richey, who upheld the injunction of PROFS records.{{sfnp|Theoharis|1998|pp=151–152}}

Richey gave a further injunction to prevent a purging of the George H.W. Bush's administration's records as well. On counts of leaving the White House clean for the new [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] Administration, the Bush group appealed but was denied its request. Finally, the Clinton Administration appealed to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]], stating that the National Security Council was not truly an agency but a group of aides to the President and thus not subject to FOIA regulations. Under the Presidential Records Act, "FOIA requests for NSC [could] not be filed until five years after the president ha[d] left office ... or twelve years if the records [were] classified."{{sfnp|Theoharis|1998|p=156}} The Clinton administration won, and the National Security Archive was not granted a [[writ of certiorari]] by the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] on these grounds. According to Scott Armstrong, taking into account labor and material costs, the three presidential administrations spent almost $9.3 million on contesting the National Security Archive FOIA requests for PROFS e-mail records.{{sfnp|Theoharis|1998|p=159}}

=== Secret e-mail accounts and abusive fees ===
The AP uncovered several federal agencies where staff regularly use fictitious identities and secret or unlisted email accounts to conduct government business. Their use stymied FOIA requests.&lt;ref name="AP20130604"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillum|first=Jack|title=TOP OBAMA APPOINTEES USING SECRET EMAIL ACCOUNTS|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/emails-top-obama-appointees-remain-mystery|accessdate=24 September 2013|publisher=The Associated Press|date=4  June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007164848/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/emails-top-obama-appointees-remain-mystery|archive-date=2013-10-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US officials found to be using secret government email accounts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/04/us-officials-secret-email-accounts|accessdate=24 September 2013|publisher=The Associated Press|work=The Guardian|date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CEC20130614"&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolery|first=Liz|title='Secret' Email Accounts Raise More Questions, Concerns About Government Transparency|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/uncat/weather.cgi?WeatherID=760|publisher=Chilling Effects Clearinghouse|accessdate=24 September 2013|date=14 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720234403/http://www.chillingeffects.org/uncat/weather.cgi?WeatherID=760|archive-date=2013-07-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/while-us-attorney-general-eric-holder-used-kareem-abdul-jabbars-birth-name-as-his-official-email-address|title=While US Attorney General, Eric Holder Used Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's Birth Name as His Official Email Address |website=VICE News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the government demanded enormous (&gt;$1 million) fees for records that appeals show should be available for minimal cost.&lt;ref name="AP20130604" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CEC20130614" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DEA wants $1.4 million before it will begin processing request|url=https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/feb/05/dea-wants-14-million-it-will-begin-processing-requ/|website=MuckRock|access-date=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2016/feb/26/biggest-foia-fee-all-time/|title=The Pentagon's $660 million FOIA fee|website=MuckRock|access-date=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing performance by different government agencies==
The [[Center for Effective Government]] analyzed 15 federal agencies which receive the most FOIA requests in-depth. It concluded, that federal agencies are struggling to implement public disclosure rules.

In the latest analysis published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available) ten of the 15 did not earn satisfactory overall grades, scoring less than 70 out of a possible 100 points. Eight of the ten earned Ds, including the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (69 percent), [[Department of Transportation]] (68 percent), [[United States Department of the Treasury]] (Treasury) (68 percent), the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) (67 percent), the [[United States Department of Labor]] (63 percent), the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (64 percent), the [[United States Department of Defense]] (61 percent), the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (61 percent). The [[Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[Department of State]] earned an F. The State Department's score (37 percent) was dismal due to its extremely low processing score of 23 percent, which was completely out of line with any other agency's performance. Scores of five agencies, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], the SEC, the DOJ, and the EPA, even decreased marginally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreffectivegov.org/access-to-information-scorecard-2015/ Making the Grade: Access to Information Scorecard 2015] March 2015, 80 pages, [[Center for Effective Government]], retrieved 21 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7560">''''Google tax'''' is a popular term used to refer to anti-avoidance provisions that have been passed in several jurisdictions dealing with profits or royalties that have been diverted to other jurisdictions with lower or nil rates.

==Diverted profits tax==
The UK and Australia measures took effect in advance of the [[Base erosion and profit shifting]] measures being considered at recent [[G20 summit]]s.

===United Kingdom===
Effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2015, the ''[[Finance Act 2015]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK |type = act|year = 2015|chapter = 11|act = Finance Act 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; imposes a levy on company profits{{em dash}}excluding those of [[small and medium-sized enterprises]]{{em dash}}that are routed via "contrived arrangements" to [[tax havens]].&lt;ref name = "Peston 11Dec2014"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Peston | first = Robert | date = 10 December 2014 | title = Who wins from Google tax? | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30420571 | newspaper = [[BBC News]] | accessdate = 11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Williams | first = Christopher | date = 10 December 2014 | title = 'Google Tax' targets 'double Irish' tax avoidance | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/autumn-statement/11284781/Google-Tax-targets-double-Irish-tax-avoidance.html | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangements can concern either those that involve entities or transactions lacking economic substance,&lt;ref&gt;FA2015, ss. 80{{en dash}}81&lt;/ref&gt; or efforts by a non-UK company to avoid a UK taxable presence.&lt;ref&gt;FA2015, ss. 86{{en dash}}87&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that determine that they are subject to the tax have a statutory duty to notify [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]] of that fact within three months after the end of the accounting period in question.&lt;ref&gt;FA2015, s. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK tax is set at 25% of taxable diverted profits (or 55% with respect to [[Ringfencing|ring fence profits]]), and will raise about £350m annually by 2017–18, according to [[HM Treasury|UK Treasury]] estimates.&lt;ref name = "Peston 11Dec2014"/&gt;

The [[Confederation of British Industry]] (CBI) described the effort to impose taxation on diverted profits as "a real concern for global business".&lt;ref name = "FT business attacks"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Houlder | first = Vanessa | date = 10 December 2014 |title = Business leaders attack UK 'Google tax' | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/12e12e3a-7fd9-11e4-adff-00144feabdc0.html |newspaper = [[The Financial Times]] | accessdate = 11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA), said, "It's a bit like reporting yourself to the police and then having to defend yourself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hall |first = Kat | date = 10 December 2014 | title = Firms will have to report OWN diverted profits under 'Google Tax' law | url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/12/10/companies_will_have_diverted_profits_under_new_google_tax/ | website = [[The Register]] | accessdate = 11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amazon.com|Amazon]] announced in May 2015 that it will start paying tax in the UK on British retail sales rather than booking sales through Luxembourg, this will mean the group will not have to pay the diverted profit tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/23/amazon-to-begin-paying-corporation-tax-on-uk-retail-sales|title = Amazon to begin paying corporation tax on UK retail sales|last = Bowers|first = Simon|date = 23 May 2015|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|access-date = 23 May 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The term has similarly been applied to the ''Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Act 2015''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/tlamtaa2015524/ ''Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Act 2015''], Act No. 170 of 2015 (Cth)&lt;/ref&gt; introduced in the [[Australian federal budget, 2015|May 2015 budget]], which received [[Royal assent]] in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Crabb|first= Annabel|date= 12 May 2015|title= Budget 2015: Hockey gets a visit from the Fairness Fairy|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-12/crabb-budget-2015-hockey-gets-a-visit-from-the-fairness-fairy/6464560|newspaper= [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provisions came into effect on 1 January 2016 "in connection with a scheme, whether or not the scheme was entered into, or was commenced to be carried out, before that day. "&lt;ref&gt;TLA(CMTA)A2015, Schedule 2, Item 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian measures focus on arrangements that attempt to avoid establishing a [[permanent establishment]] presence in Australia. While they were originally intended to target a group of thirty large [[multinational corporation]]s, other taxpayers will still need to document whether they would be subject to the provisions, as the [[Australian Taxation Office]] would have the power to assess an [[Administrative Monetary Penalty|administrative penalty]] of 100% of any calculated shortfall of tax owed, together with base tax and interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tax-services/publications/insights/assets/pwc-australia-introduces-multinational-anti-avoidance-legislation.pdf|title= Australia introduces multinational anti-avoidance legislation into parliament|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= September 21, 2015|website= |publisher= [[Pricewaterhouse Coopers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2016 Australian federal budget]], the government announced the introduction of a diverted profits tax (DPT) from 1 July 2017. The ''Diverted Profits Tax Act 2017'' imposes a 40 percent tax on avoidance schemes entered into by significant global entities (SGEs), which are defined as global parent entities with an annual global income of A$1 billion or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/general/new-legislation/in-detail/direct-taxes/income-tax-for-businesses/diverted-profits-tax/?=redirected|title=Diverted profits tax|publisher=Australian Taxation Office|access-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royalty charges==
{{seealso|Ancillary copyright for press publishers}}
The term has also been used to refer to a tax in Spain, introduced in 2014, that imposes a royalty charge on [[Google]] when its news site, [[Google News]], uses material belonging to a Spanish publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bershidsky | first = Leonid  | date = 11 December 2014 | title = Why 'Google Tax' Became a Catchphrase | url = http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-12-11/why-google-tax-became-a-catchphrase | website = bloomberg.com | accessdate = 11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Google's response was to cease collating such articles on Google News.&lt;ref name = "Google closes"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rushe | first = Dominic | date = 11 December 2014 | title = Google News Spain to close in response to story links 'tax' | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/11/google-news-spain-to-close-in-response-to-tax-on-story-links | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after the outbreak of World War II, Noel and his friends became increasingly disturbed over what was happening in the world; Noel's unease culminated with his withdrawal from the school in 1943.&lt;ref name="MilwaukeeJournal"/&gt;

==Travels and renunciation==
After his withdrawal, Noel, unable to enlist in the Army due to his poor eyesight, joined the [[American Field Service]] as an ambulance driver, in which capacity he served in India and Italy.&lt;ref name="MilwaukeeJournal"/&gt; Noel came to Germany in September 1947 after working for the U.S. Aid to France Commission in France. He found work with a German construction firm at [[Kassel]].&lt;ref name="Daytona"/&gt; He earned a wage of 25 marks per week, and lived in a tiny room with no electricity.&lt;ref name="DerSpiegel"/&gt; He subsisted on German rations of 1550 calories per day. In February 1948, he [[renunciation of United States citizenship|renounced his U.S. citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&amp;dat=19480219&amp;id=IhIpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G9cEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4451,3143395|title=Former Harvard Student Renounces Citizenship To Live in Germany|work=The Southeast Missourian/Associated Press|date=1948-02-19|accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October, he had successfully integrated into his new home, and stated he felt "accepted" by the community there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/2051295162.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+24%2C+1948&amp;author=&amp;pub=Daily+Boston+Globe+(1928-1960)&amp;desc=German+Town+Has+Accepted+N.H.+%22Man+Without+a+Country%22&amp;pqatl=google|first=Eldon|last=Cohen|title=German Town Has Accepted N.H.

==Reactions to renunciation==
''The Montreal Gazette'' described Noel's action as "a gesture bound to be in vain ... his personal error is in supposing that an individual protest of this nature can be effective".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2zIrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BJkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5934,3435140|title=A Gesture Bound To Be In Vain|work=The Montreal Gazette|date=1948-02-20|accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Gallico]] described Noel as part of a trend of "youthful U.S. citizens with bleeding hearts who renounce family ties, our way of life, and depart these shores to snuggle up to a gang of brutes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_m1PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B08DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6178,861762|first=Paul|last=Gallico|title=What Makes Americans Renounce Citizenship|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=1948-06-01|accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' wrote a largely supportive editorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/172949082.html?dids=172949082:172949082&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Feb+21%2C+1948&amp;author=&amp;pub=Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;desc=Man+Without+a+Country&amp;pqatl=google|title=Man Without A Country|work=The Christian Science Monitor|date=1948-02-21|accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garry Davis]] also described Noel as one of his inspirations for his own renunciation of citizenship and subsequent creation of the [[World Service Authority]].&lt;ref name="SevenDays"/&gt; Soon after Noel and Davis' renunciations, Arthur W.

'''Human rights''' applied to '''encryption''' is an important concept for freedom of expression as encryption is a technical resource of implementation of basic human rights.

With the evolution of the [[digital age]], application of [[freedom of speech]] becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise including government control or commercial methods putting personal information to danger. From a [[human rights]] perspective, there is a growing awareness that encryption is an important piece of the puzzle for realizing a free, open and trustworthy [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Human rights are [[Morality|moral]] principles or [[Norm (social)|norms]] that describe certain standards of human behavior, and are regularly protected as [[legal rights]] in [[Municipal law|municipal]] and [[international law]].&lt;ref name="Human Rights"&gt;James Nickel, with assistance from Thomas Pogge, M.B.E.

[[Cryptography]] is a long-standing subject in the field of [[mathematics]], [[computer science]] and [[engineering]]. It can generally be defined as "the protection of information and computation using mathematical techniques."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cryptology and Privacy, In: Van Der Sloot, Broeders and Schrijvers (eds.), Exploring the Boundaries of Big Data|last=Gürses|first=Seda|last2=Preneel|first2=Bart|publisher=Netherlands Scientific Council for Government Policy|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[OECD]] Guidelines, [[Encryption]] and cryptography are defined as follows: "Encryption" means the transformation of data by the use of cryptography to produce unintelligible data (encrypted data) to ensure its [[confidentiality]].

The human rights aspects related to the availability and use of a technology of particular significance for the field of information and communication is recognised in many places. Freedom of expression is recognized as a human right under article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and recognized in [[international human rights law]] in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR). Article 19 of the UDHR states that "everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference" and "everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice".&lt;ref&gt;Article 19, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

== Overview ==

Since the 1970s, the availability of [[digital computing]] and the invention of [[Public-key cryptography|public key]] cryptography has made encryption more widely available. Previously, strong versions of encryption were the domain of [[nation state]] actors. However, since the year 2000, cryptographic techniques have been widely deployed by a variety of actors to ensure personal, commercial and [[public sector]] protection of information and communication. Cryptographic techniques are also used to protect [[anonymity]] of communicating actors and protecting [[privacy]] more generally. The availability and use of encryption continues to lead to complex, important and highly contentious legal policy debates. There are government statements and proposals on the need to curtail such usage and deployment in view of the potential hurdles it could present for access by [[government]] agencies. The rise of commercial services offering [[end-to-end encryption]] and the calls for restrictions and solutions in view of law enforcement access are pushing towards more and more debates around the use of encryption and the legal status of the deployment of cryptography more generally.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human rights and encryption|last=Wolfgang|first=Schulz|last2=van Hoboken|first2=Joris|publisher=UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100185-7|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002465/246527e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encryption, as defined above, refers to a subset of cryptographic techniques for the protection of [[information]] and [[computation]]. The [[normative]] value of encryption, however, is not fixed but varies with the type of cryptographic method that is used or deployed and for which purposes. Traditionally, encryption (cypher) techniques were used to ensure the confidentiality of communications and prevent access to information and communications by others than intended recipients. Cryptography can also ensure the authenticity of communicating parties and the integrity of communications contents, providing a key ingredient for enabling trust in the [[digital environment]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is a growing awareness within human rights that encryption plays an important role in realizing a free, open and trustworthy Internet. UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression [[David Kaye (law professor)|David Kaye]] observed, during the Human Rights Council in June 2015, that encryption and anonymity deserve a protected status under the rights to privacy and freedom of expression:

''"Encryption and anonymity, today's leading vehicles for online security, provide individuals with a means to protect their privacy, empowering them to browse, read, develop and share opinions and information without interference and enabling journalists, civil society organizations, members of ethnic or religious groups, those persecuted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, activists, scholars, artists and others to exercise the rights to freedom of opinion and expression."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Keystones to foster inclusive knowledge societies: access to information and knowledge, freedom of expression, privacy and ethics on a global internet|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232563&amp;set=0059EDFBB1_1_85&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Encryption in media and communication ==

Two types of encryption in media and communication can be distinguished:
# Encryption in media and communication could be used as a result of choice of a service provider or deployed by Internet users. [[Client-side encryption]] tools and technologies are relevant for [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] communities, journalists and other online media actors practicing journalism as it becomes a way of protecting their rights.
# Encryption provided by [[service provider]]s can prevent unauthorized [[Third-party access|third party access]], but the service provider implementing it would still have access to the relevant user data. End-to-end encryption is an encryption technique that refers to encryption that also prevents service providers themselves from having access to the user's communications. The [[implementation]] of these forms of encryption have sparked the most debate since the year 2000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Service provider deployed techniques to prevent unauthorized third-party access ===

Amongst the most widely deployed cryptographic techniques is securing the [[Communication channel|communications channel]] between internet users and specific service providers from [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] attacks, access by unauthorized third parties. These cryptographic techniques must be run jointly by a user and the service provider to work. This means that they require service providers, such as an online news publisher or a [[Social networking service|social network]], to actively integrate them into service design and implementation. Users cannot deploy these techniques [[Unilateralism|unilaterally]]; their deployment is contingent on active participation by the service provider.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The [[Transport Layer Security|TLS protocol]], which becomes visible to the normal internet user through the [[HTTPS]] header, is widely used for securing online commerce, [[e-government]] services and health applications as well as devices that make up networked infrastructures, e.g., routers, cameras. However, although the standard has been around since 1990, the wider spread and evolution of the technology has been slow. As with other cryptographic methods and protocols, the practical challenges related to proper, secure and (wider) deployment are significant and have to be considered. Many service providers still do not implement TLS or do not implement it well.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In the context of [[wireless]] communications, the use of cryptographic techniques that protect communications from third parties are also important. Different standards have been developed to protect wireless communications: [[2G]], [[3G]] and [[4G]] standards for communication between mobile phones, base stations and base stations controllers; standards to protect communications between mobile devices and wireless routers ('[[Wireless LAN|WLAN]]'); and standards for local computer networks.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} One common weakness in these designs is that the transmission points of the wireless communication can access all communications e.g., the [[Telecommunications service provider|telecommunications provider]]. This vulnerability is exacerbated when wireless protocols only [[Authentication|authenticate]] user devices, but not the [[wireless access point]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Whether the data is stored on a device, or on a local server as in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]], there is also a distinction between 'at rest'. Given the vulnerability of cellphones to theft for instance, particular attention may be given to limiting service provided access. This does not exclude the situation that the service provider discloses this information to third parties like other commercial entities or governments. The user needs to trust the service provider to act in its interests. The possibility that a service provider is legally compelled to hand over user information or to interfere with particular communications with particular users, remains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Privacy Enhancing Technologies ===

There are services that specifically [[Marketing|market]] themselves with claims not to have access to the content of their users' communication. Service Providers can also take measures that restrict their ability to access information and communication, further increasing the protection of users against access to their information and communications. The integrity of these [[Privacy-enhancing technologies|Privacy Enhancing Technologies]] (PETs), depends on delicate [[design]] decisions as well as the willingness of the service provider to be transparent and [[Accountability|accountable]].&lt;ref name="Human Rights" /&gt; For many of these services, the service provider may offer some additional features (besides the ability to communicate), for example contact list management—meaning that they can observe who is communicating with whom—but take technical measures so that they cannot read the contents of the messages. This has potentially negative implications for users, for instance, since the service provider has to take action to connect users who want to communicate using the service, it will also have the power to prevent users from communicating in the first place.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Following the discovery of [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]], there is a growing [[awareness]] that there needs to be more investment in the [[audit]]ing of widely used [[code]] coming out of the free and open [[software]] community. The pervasiveness of [[business model]]s that depend on collection and processing of user data can be an obstacle for adopting cryptographic mechanisms for protecting information at rest. As [[Bruce Schneier]], has stated:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''"[s]urveillance is the business model of the Internet. This has evolved into a shockingly extensive, robust, and profitable surveillance architecture. You are being tracked pretty much everywhere you go on the Internet, by many companies and [[data brokers]]: ten different companies on one site, a dozen on another."''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How We Sold Our Souls - and More - to the Internet Giants|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2015/05/how_we_sold_our_soul.html|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryptographic methods play a key role in [[online identity management]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Digital credential|Digital credential systems]] can be used to allow anonymous yet authenticated and accountable transactions between users and service providers, and can be used to build privacy preserving identity management systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hero or Villain: The Data Controller in Privacy Law and Technologies|last=Claudia Diaz, Omer Tene and Seda Gürses|first=|publisher=74 Ohio State Law Journal|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== End-user and community-driven encryption and collaborative services ===

The Internet allows [[End user|end-users]] to develop applications and uses of the network without having to coordinate with the relevant [[internet service provider]]s. Many of the available encryption tools are not developed or offered by traditional service providers or organizations but by [[expert]]s in the [[Free and open-source software|free and open software]] (FOSS) and Internet engineering communities. A major focus of these initiatives is to produce Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) that can be unilaterally or collaboratively deployed by interested users who are ready, willing, and able to look after their own privacy interests when interacting with service providers. These PETs include standalone encryption applications as well as [[browser add-on]]s that help maintain the confidentiality of web-based communications or permit anonymous access to online services. Technologies such as [[Keystroke logging|keystroke loggers]] can intercept content as it is entered before encryption is applied, thereby falling short of offering protection. Hacking into information systems and devices to access data at or after the moment of [[decryption]] may have the same effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Multi-party computation]] (MPC) techniques are an example of Collaboration|collaborative solutions that allow parties, e.g. [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] with sensitive data, to do [[Data analysis|data analytics]] without revealing their [[Data set|datasets]] to each other. All of these designs leverage encryption to provide privacy and [[security]] assurances in the absence of a trustworthy centralized authority.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are many developments in the implementations of [[Cryptocurrency|crypto-currencies]] using blockchain protocols. These systems can have many benefits and these [[Cryptographic protocol|protocol]]s can also be useful for novel forms of contracts and electronic attestation, useful aids when legal infrastructure are not readily available. As to the protection of privacy related to payments, it is a common misconception that the cryptographic techniques that are used in [[Bitcoin]] ensure anonymous payments. The only protection offered by Bitcoin is [[pseudonymity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bitcoinisnotanonymous.com/|title=See Bitcoin is NOT anonymous|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The cryptographic protection of metadata ===

The availability of [[metadata]] (the information relating to a user's information and communications behavior) can pose a particular threat to users including information that can be observed by service providers through the provisioning of services: when, how frequently, how long, and with whom users are communicating. Metadata can also be used to track people geographically and can interfere with their ability to communicate anonymously.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} As noted by the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society|Berkman Center]] report, metadata is generally not encrypted in ways that make it inaccessible for governments, and accordingly ''"provides an enormous amount of surveillance data that was unavailable before [internet communication technologies] became widespread."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Bekman Center|last=|first=|date=2016|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to minimize exposure of meaningful metadata, encryption tools may need to be used in combination with technologies that provide communication anonymity.
{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== The Onion Router ====
[[The Onion Router]], most commonly known as [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], offers the ability to access websites and online services anonymously. Tor requires a community of volunteers to run intermediary proxies which channel a user's communication with a website so that third parties cannot observe who the user is communicating with. Through the use of encryption, each proxy is only aware of part of the communication path meaning that none of the proxies can by itself infer both the user and the website she is visiting. Besides protecting anonymity, Tor is also useful when the user's ISP blocks access to content.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is similar as the protection that can be offered by a [[Virtual private network|VPN]]. Service providers, such as websites, can block connections that come from the Tor network. Because certain malicious traffic may reach service providers as Tor traffic and because Tor traffic may also interfere with the business models, service providers may have an [[incentive]] to do so. This interference can prevent users from using the most effective means to protect their anonymity online. The Tor browser allows users to [[Obfuscation|obfuscate]] the origin and [[Endpoint security|end-points]] of their communications when they communicate on the internet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Obfuscation ====
Obfuscation, the automated generation of "fake" signals that are indistinguishable from users' actual online activities, providing users with a noisy "cover" under which their real information and communication behavior remains unobservable. Obfuscation has received more attention as a method to protect users online recently. [[TrackMeNot]] is an obfuscation tool for search engine users: the plugin sends fake search queries to the [[Web search engine|search engine]], affecting the ability of the search engine provider to build an accurate profile of the user. Although TrackMeNot and other search obfuscation tools have been found to be vulnerable to certain attacks that allow search engines to distinguish between user-generated and computer-generated queries, further advances in obfuscation are likely to play a positive role in protecting users when disclosure of information is inevitable, as in the case of search or [[location-based service]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Cryptography, law and human rights ==

=== Restrictions on cryptographic techniques ===

Recent incidents of terrorism have led to further calls for restrictions on encryption.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Don't Panic: Making Progress on the "Going Dark" Debate|last=Berkman Center|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though, in the interest of [[Public security|public safety]], there are many proposals to interfere with the free deployment of strong encryption, these proposals do not hold against close scientific [[scrutiny]]. These proposals side-step a more fundamental point, related to what is at stake for users. More advanced security measures seem necessary for governments, considering the existing threat landscape for users of digital communications and [[computing]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

While many governments consider that encryption techniques could present a hurdle in the investigation of crime and the protection of [[national security]], certain countries, such as [[Germany]] or the [[Netherlands]] have taken a strong position against restrictions on encryption on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=For a discussion of Germany|last=McCarthy|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Ministers of the Interior of [[France]] and Germany have jointly stated the need to work on solutions for the challenges law enforcement can face as a result of end-to-end encryption, in particular when offered from a foreign jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Le-ministre/Interventions-du-ministre/Initiative-francoallemande-sur-la-securite-interieure-en-Europe|title=Bernard Cazeneuve, French Minister of the Interior, Speech at the Joint Press Conference with Thomas de Maizière, German Minister of the Interior, Paris|last=|first=|date=23 August 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a joint statement, the European Agency for Network and Information Security ([[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security|ENISA]]) and [[Europol]] have also taken a stance against the introduction of backdoors in encryption products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=On lawful criminal investigation that respects 21st Century data protection|last=ENISA and Europol Joint Statement|first=|date=20 May 2016|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, restrictions would have serious detrimental effects on [[Computer security|cyber security]], trade and [[e-commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-fbi-terror-encrypt-apple-google-edit-1214-20151211-story.html|title=See also Chicago Tribune.

=== Encryption and the law: the broader landscape ===

Privacy and [[Information privacy|data protection]] [[legislation]] is closely related to the protection of human rights. There are now more than 100 countries with data protection laws.&lt;ref&gt;Greenleaf 2015. For this count, the inclusion of rules on security was a criterion.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key principles for the fair and lawful processing of personal information regulated by data protection laws is the principle of security. This principle implies that proper security measures are taken to ensure the protection of personal data against unlawful access by others than intended recipients.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[European Data Protection Supervisor|European Union General Data Protection Regulation]], which was adopted in 2016 and will enter in to force in 2018, contains an advanced set of rules with respect to the security of personal data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Encryption can be a [[safeguard]] against personal [[data breach]]es for the UN, as it can facilitate the implementation of privacy and data protection by design.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cryptography has also been an essential ingredient for establishing the conditions for e-Commerce over the Internet. The OECD Principles were adopted to ensure that national cryptography policy would not interfere with trade and to ensure the conditions for international developments in e-Commerce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== International cryptography policy and human rights ===

The [[policy]] debate about encryption has a significant international dimension because of the [[Transnationalism|international nature of the communications networks]] and the Internet as well as trade, [[globalization]] and the national security dimensions. The OECD adopted a Recommendation Concerning Guidelines for Cryptography Policy on 27 March 1997. There are three components to this policy intervention of the OECD, which is primarily aimed at its Member Countries: a recommendation of the OECD Council, Guidelines for Cryptography Policy (as an Annex to the Recommendation) and a Report on Background and Issues of Cryptography Policy to explain the context for the Guidelines and the basic issues involved in the [[cryptography law]] and [[policy debate]]. The Principle most explicit about the connection to human rights is Principle 5 on the Protection of Privacy and Personal Data: ''"The fundamental rights of individuals to privacy, including secrecy of communications and protection of personal data, should be respected in national cryptography policies and in the implementation and use of cryptographic methods."''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[UNESCO]], after consulting [[Multistakeholder governance model|stakeholders]], identified encryption as a relevant element for policy on privacy and freedom of expression. The Keystones Report (2015) articulates that ''"to the extent that our data can be considered representative of ourselves, encryption has a role to play in protecting who we are, and in preventing abuse of user content. It also allows for greater protection of privacy and anonymity in transit by ensuring that the contents (and sometimes also the metadata) of communications are only seen by the intended recipient."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' The report recognizes ''"the role that anonymity and encryption can play as enablers of privacy protection and freedom of expression"'', and proposes that UNESCO facilitate dialogue on these issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[Necessary and Proportionate Principles]] developed and adopted by [[civil society]] actors stipulates the protection of the [[integrity]] of [[communications system]]s as one of its 13 principles.&lt;ref&gt;See here: https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles&lt;/ref&gt; The principles themselves do not provide for explicit guidance on specific cryptographic policy issues such as backdoors or restrictions on the deployment of encryption. The guidance that is offered by the OECD principles and the recent positions of the UN Rapporteur on Encryption state the importance of encryption for the protection of human rights. While it does not give a definitive answer to the question of whether a mandate for encryption backdoors is to be considered incompatible with international law, it does point in that direction. Generally, the available guidance at the international level clarifies that when limitations are imposed on encryption, relevant human rights guarantees have to be strictly observed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== National level developments in selected countries ==

=== United States of America ===
There has been a broad, active and contentious policy debate on encryption in the [[United States|USA]] since the 1990s beginning with the '[[Crypto Wars]]'. This involved the adoption of the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]] (CALEA), containing requirements for [[telecommunication]]s providers and equipment manufacturers to ensure the possibility of effective [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]].&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 103-414, 108 Stat. 4279, codified at 47 USC 1001-1010&lt;/ref&gt; It also involved a debate over existing export controls on strong encryption products (considering their classification as munition) and a criminal investigation into cryptographic email software developer and activist [[Phil Zimmermann]]. The case was dropped and the general debate resolved after the [[liberalization]] of export controls on most commercial products with strong encryption features and the transfer of these items from the U.S.A. Munitions List ([[United States Munitions List|USML]]), administered by the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], to the [[Commerce Control List]] (CCL), administered by the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;See USA Department of Commerce, Encryption Export Controls: Revision of License Exception ENC and Mass Market Eligibility. June 2010. See also Ira Rubinstein and Michael Hintze. Export Controls on Encryption Software. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://encryption_policies.tripod.com/us/rubinstein_1200_software.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The USA Department of Commerce maintains some controls over items on the CCL, including registration, technical reviews and reporting obligations, and continues to impose licensing and other requirements for sensitive encryption items and sales of such items to foreign governments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The debate ignited after the [[Edward Snowden]] revelations and the well-documented increase in deployed encryption measures by Internet services, device makers and users, as well as a concerted call from the technical community and civil society to increase encryption use and security to address [[mass surveillance]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;See Ira Rubinstein and Joris van Hoboken. Privacy and Security in the Cloud, Maine Law Review 2014. Notably, the debate on encryption was already taking place before the Snowden revelations, as US law enforcement actors were arguing for the extension of wiretap obligations (CALEA) for internet services. For a discussion, see Adida et al. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The increased adoption of encryption by the [[industry]] has been received critically by certain government actors, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in particular.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This led to the widely reported [[FBI–Apple encryption dispute]] over the possibility to gain access to information on the [[iPhone]] in assistance to law enforcement. In 2016, several bills were introduced in the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] that would place new limits encryption under USA law. The USA's legal system promotes and requires security measures to be implemented in the relevant contexts, including cryptographic methods of various kinds, to ensure security in commerce and trade. Relevant laws are the [[Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014|Federal Information Security Modernization Act]] (FISMA) of 2014, the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act|Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,]] the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) and also the [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914|Federal Trade Commission Act]]. These acts contain security requirements and thereby indirectly require or stimulate the use of encryption in certain circumstances. Finally, many state breach notification laws treat encrypted data as a [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] by exempting firms that have encrypted data from notice obligations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Constitution]]al considerations and [[Human rights in the United States|human rights]] play a role of significance in the USA debate about the legal treatment of encryption methods. Restrictions on distribution of cryptographic protocols, and the publication of cryptographic methods are considered an interference with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], the USA constitutional safeguard protecting freedom of expression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The USA has particularly active and strongly developed civil society actors involved in cryptographic policy and practice.

The United States of America is a primary site for cryptology research and engineering, development and implementation of cryptographic service innovations. There is an active community of Non-Governmental Organizations engaged in the national and international debate on encryption policy.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the Encrypt all the Things Campaign.&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant interferences with strong encryption that take place or are being considered take place in the field of [[National Security Agency|national security,]] [[law enforcement]] and [[Foreign Affairs|foreign affairs]]. In this area and in answering the contentious question of whether and how lawful access to specific communications could be ensured, the US Government has internationally explained its policy as one aiming to ensure that 'responsibly deployed encryption' helps to ''"secure many aspects of our daily lives, including our private communications and commerce",'' but also ''"to ensure that malicious actors can be held to account without weakening our commitment to strong encryption"''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Germany ===
As part of the global debate on encryption in the late 1990s, a debate also took place in Germany about the need and legitimacy of imposing a general ban on the encryption of communications because of the impact on criminal investigations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grundrecht auf Verschlüsselung?|last=Koch|first=Alexander|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were profound doubts concerning the constitutional [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] as well as concerns about negative factual consequences of such a ban.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In qualitative terms, a number of [[fundamental rights]] are considered to be affected by restrictions on encryption: the secrecy of telecommunications, expressions of the general right of personality and, indirectly, all communicative freedoms that are exercisable over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=(Grund-)Recht auf Verschlüsselung?|last=Gerhards|first=Julia|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Politics of Germany|Federal Government]] set key points in 1999 for the German cryptographic policy which should especially provide confidence in the security of encryption instead of restricting it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Besides the statements of the German Minister of the Interior towards possible future restrictions, Germany aligns with the position of the UN Special Rapporteur David Kaye and adopts policies of non-restriction or comprehensive protection and only adopts restrictions on a case-specific basis. In November 2015 governmental representatives as well as representatives of the [[private sector]] signed a "Charter to strengthen the trusted communication "(Charta zur Stärkung der vertrauenswürdigen Kommunikation) together, in which they stated: ''"We want to be Encryption Site No. 1 in the world"''.&lt;ref&gt;Digital Agenda 2014-2017, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German Government|German government]] has also used its foreign policy to promote international privacy standards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In particular, Germany, in a joint effort with [[Brazil]], committed itself in the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] for the appointment of an UN Special Rapporteur on Privacy.&lt;ref&gt;See Monika Ermert, NSA-Skandal: UN-Sonderberichterstatter für Datenschutz in der digitalen Welt angestrebt, Heise Online, 23 March 2015, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/NSA-Skandal-UNSonderberichterstatter-fuer-Datenschutz-in-der-digitalen-Welt-angestrebt-2582480.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple examples of how there have been efforts by the government to implement encryption policy. They range from informal actions, to laws and regulations: The IT Security Act in 2015, the 'De-Mail' law. There are also several sector-specific rules for encryption and information security in Germany, like the Telecommunications Act (TKG). The [[Federal Constitutional Court|German Constitutional Court]] has also provided valuable input for the international legal handling of encryption techniques with the IT basic right, with which, the constitutional court recognizes that parts of one's personality go into IT systems and therefore the applied protection has to travel with it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== India ===
There are a number of limitations on the free deployment of encryption by electronic communications services despite the fact that [[Law of India|Indian law]] and policy promotes and requires the implementation of strong encryption as a security measure, such as in [[Banking in India|banking]], ecommerce and by organizations handling sensitive personal information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is notable legal uncertainty about the precise legal scope of these license requirements and to what extent they could have legal effect on (the use of or deployment of ) services by the end-users of covered services. The encryption debate ignited publicly in India in 2008 after the Government published a draft proposal with a number of envisioned limitations on the use of encryption. The policy, issued under Section 84A of the Indian Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 was short-lived, but worries remain about the lack of safeguards for privacy and freedom of expression that the draft illustrated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In response to the outcry, the Indian government first exempted ''"mass use encryption products, which are currently being used in web applications, social media sites, and social media applications such as Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter etc."'' Soon thereafter, it withdrew the proposed policy and a new policy has not been made public yet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Section 84A of the Indian Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 [[Empowerment|empowers]] the government to formulate rules on modes of encryption for the electronic medium. Legal commentators have noted the lack of [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] about what types of encryption use and deployment are permitted and required under Indian law, especially in the field of electronic communications services.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, the Central Indian Government has, in theory, a broad exclusive [[monopoly]] over electronic communications which includes the privilege to provide telecommunication and Internet services in India.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Brazil ===
After the Edward Snowden revelations in 2013, Brazil was at the forefront of a global coalition promoting the right to privacy at the UN and condemning USA mass surveillance. In recent events, Brazil has demonstrated diverse aims when it comes to the use and implementation of encryption. On the one side, the country is a leader in providing a legal framework of rules for the Internet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; But it has also taken several measures that may be seen to restrict the dissemination of encryption technology. In 2015, in a process that was open for public comments and discussions, Brazil's [[legislator]] drafted a new privacy bill ("proteção de dados pessoais"), which was sent to Brazil's Federal Congress on 13 May 2016 and came into force as Bill 5276 of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://pensando.mj.gov.br/dadospessoais/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It regulates and protects [[personal data]] and privacy, including online practices and includes provisions for more secure methods such as encryption on the treatment of personal data. The law also addresses security issues and a duty for companies to report any attacks and security breaches. With the [[Marco Civil]] (2014), that introduces principles like [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]], the [[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet]], Brazil was one of the first countries to ever introduce a law, that aims at combining all Internet rules in one bundle. Brazil has a well-established e-government model: The Brazilian Public Key Infrastructure (Infraestrutura de Chaves Públicas Brasileira – ICP-Brasil).&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iti.gov.br/icp-brasil&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010 ICP-Brasil certificates can be partly integrated in Brazilian IDs, which can then be used for several services like tax revenue service, judicial services or bank related services. In practice, the ICP-Brasil digital certificate acts as a [[Online identity|virtual identity]] that enables secure and unique identification of the author of a message or transaction made in an electronic medium such as the web. Brazilian courts have taken a stance against encryption in private messaging services by repeatedly ordering the [[Internet censorship|blocking]] of the messaging service [[WhatsApp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/344200/brazil-bans-whatsapp-again-over-encryption|title=Brazil Bans WhatsApp (Again) Over Encryption|last=Mlot|first=Stephanie|date=3 May 2016|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it switched to a full end-to-end encryption, the service has been periodically blocked as a result of a court order in an attempt to make the company comply with demands for information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== African countries ===

The African ([[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights|Banjul]]) Charter on Human and People's Rights, was adopted in the context of the [[African Union]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;African (Banjul) Charter on Human and People's Rights, Adopted 27 June 1981, OAU Doc. CAB/LEG/67/3 rev. 5, 21 I.L.M. 58 (1982), entered into force 21 October 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; A Protocol to the Charter, establishing the [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] was adopted in 1998 and came into effect in 2005. In the area of [[information policy]], the African Union has adopted the African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection.&lt;ref&gt;African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection, adopted on 27 June 2014. The Convention has currently been signed by 8 of the Member States.&lt;/ref&gt; The provisions on personal data protection in this Convention generally follow the [[European Union|European model]] for the protection of data privacy and contains a number of provisions on the security of personal data processing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A civil society initiative has adopted a specific African Declaration on Internet Rights and Freedoms "to help shape approaches to Internet policy-making and governance across the continent".&lt;ref&gt;See African Declaration on Internet Rights and Freedoms, available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://africaninternetrights.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Northern Africa ====
Different countries in the [[North Africa|North-Africa]]n region have not seen a significant rise in legal actions aiming at the suppression of encryption in the [[Arab Spring|transformations that started in 2011]]. Although legislation often dates back to before the transformations, the enforcement has become stricter since then. No difference in the position towards cryptography can be seen between the countries that had successful revolutions and went through regime changes and those that didn't.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Tunisia]] has several laws that limit online anonymity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Articles 9 and 87 of the 2001 Telecommunication Code ban the use of encryption and provide a sanction of up to five years in prison for the unauthorized sale and use of such techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Loi n° 1-2001 du 15 janvier 2001 portant promulgation du code des télécommunications (Tunesia), available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=204160&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Algeria]], users have legally needed authorization for the use of cryptographic technology from the relevant telecommunications authority ARPT (Autorité de Régulation de la Poste et des Télécommunications) since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Decision No 17 du 11 June 2012, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.arpt.dz/fr/doc/reg/dec/2012/DEC_N17_11_06_2012.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Egypt]], Article 64 of the 2003 Telecommunication Regulation Law states that the use of encryption devices is prohibited without the written consent of the NTRA, the military, and national security authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Egypt Telecommunications Regulation Law (Translation), available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/Egypt/Egypt%20Telecommunication%20Regulation%20Law.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Morocco]], the [[import]] and [[export]] of cryptographic technology, be it soft- or hardware, requires a [[license]] from the government. The relevant law No. 53-05 (Loi n° 53-05 relative à l'échange électronique de données juridiques) went into effect in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin officiel n° 6332 du 15 rabii II 1436 (5 February 2015), available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://adala.justice.gov.ma/production/html/Fr/liens/..%5C188896.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== East Africa ====
There are no specific provisions in effect in countries in the [[East Africa|East-Africa]]n region restricting the use of encryption technology. As in other African countries, the main reason given for State surveillance is the prevention of [[Terroristic threat|terroristic]] attacks. [[Kenya]] with its proximity to [[Somalia]], has cited this threat for adopting restrictive actions. The country has recently fast-tracked a Computer and Cybercrime Law, to be adopted in the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;See MyGov, Computer and cybercrime law to be in place before end year, 29 June 2016, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mygov.go.ke/?p=10848&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Uganda]] a number of laws and [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] policies have been passed over the past three years, none of them however deal with encryption. In 2016, following the Presidential Elections, the Ugandan government shut down social networks such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and WhatsApp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35601220|title=Uganda Election: Facebook and Whatsapp blocked|last=|first=|date=18 February 2016|work=BBC News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== West Africa ====
[[West Africa|West-Africa]]n countries neither limit the import or export of encryption technology, nor its use, most national and foreign [[companies]] still rely on the use of VPNs for their communication. [[Ghana]] recently introduced a draft law aiming at intercepting electronic and postal communications of citizens, to aid crime prevention. Section 4(3) of the proposed bill gives the government permission to intercept anyone's communication upon only receiving oral order from a public officer.&lt;ref&gt;Ajibola Adigun, Affront on Freedom in Ghana with the Introduction of Spy Bill, Student For Liberty, 29 March 2016, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://studentsforliberty.org/africa/2016/03/29/affront-on-freedom-in-ghana-with-theintroduction-of-spy-bill/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Recently the [[Nigeria]]n Communications Commission has drafted a bill regarding Lawful Interception of Communications Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Nigerian Communications Commission, Draft Lawful Interception of Communications Regulations, available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://bit.ly/1du7UKO&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; If passed, the bill allows the interception of all communication without [[Judiciary|judicial]] oversight or court order and forces mobile [[Telephone company|phone companies]] to store voice and [[Data transmission|data communication]] for three years. Furthermore, the draft plans to give the National Security Agency a right to ask for a key to decrypt all encrypted communication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Southern Africa ====
Users in [[South Africa]] are not prohibited from using encryption.&lt;ref&gt;See Freedom House, Freedom on the Net 2015: South Africa, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedomnet/2015/south-africa&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The provision of such technology, however, is strictly regulated by the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;See Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, 2002 No. 25 of 2002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.internet.org.za/ect_act.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central Africa ====
Countries in [[Central Africa]], like the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Gabon]] and [[Cameroon]] do not yet have a well-developed [[legal framework]] addressing Internet policy issues. The Internet remains a relatively unregulated sphere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Human rights legal framework related to cryptography ==

=== International instruments ===
While a very broad range of human rights is touched upon by [[Digital Technologies|digital technologies]], the human rights to freedom of expression (Art. 19 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [ICCPR]) and the right to private life (Art. 17 ICCPR) are of particular relevance to the protection of cryptographic methods. Unlike the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) which is international '[[soft law]]', the ICCPR is a [[legally binding]] [[international treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression: progressive development of international standards relating to freedom of expression. in: McGonagle and Donders|last=Mendel|first=Toby|publisher=The United Nations and Freedom of Expression and Information|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=238, chapter 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restrictions on the right to freedom of expression are only permitted under the conditions of Article 19, paragraph 3. Restrictions shall be provided for by law and they shall be necessary (a) for the respect of the rights or reputations of others or (b) for the protection of national security or of [[Public-order crime|public order]] or of [[public health]] or [[morals]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A further possibility for restriction is set out in Art. 20 ICCPR,&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Nowak, CCPR Commentary, 2nd edition, p. 477. Cf. Michael O'Flaherty. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: interpreting freedom of expression and information standards for the present and the future. in: McGonagle and Donders. The United Nations and Freedom of Expression and Information. chapter 2, p. 69 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of limitations on cryptography, restrictions will most often be based on Article 19 (3)(b), i.e. risks for national security and public order. This raises the complex issue of the relation, and distinction, between security of the individual, e.g. from interference with personal electronic communications, and national security. The right to privacy&lt;ref&gt;Art. 17 ICCPR; Art. 21 ACHR (Arab); Art. 11 ACHR (America); Art. 21 AHRD.&lt;/ref&gt; protects against 'arbitrary or unlawful interference' with one's privacy, one's family, one's home and one's correspondence. Additionally, Article 17(1) of the ICCPR protects against 'unlawful attacks' against one's honor and reputation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The scope of Article 17 is broad. Privacy can be understood as the right to control information about one's self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fried|first=Charles|date=1968|title=Privacy|url=|journal=77 Yale Law Journal|volume=|pages=475, 483|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility to live one's life as one sees fit, within the boundaries set by the law, effectively depends on the information which others have about us and use to inform their behavior towards us. That is part of the core justification for protecting privacy as a human right.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to the duty to not infringe these rights, States have a positive obligation to effectively ensure the enjoyment of freedom of expression and privacy of every individual under their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;CCPR/G/GC/34, § 11.&lt;/ref&gt; These rights may conflict with other rights and interests, such as [[dignity]], equality or life and security of an individual or legitimate public interests. In these cases, the integrity of each right or value must be maintained to the maximum extent, and any limitations required for balancing have to be in law, necessary and proportionate (especially least restrictive) in view of a legitimate aim (such as the rights of others, public morals and national security).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Guaranteeing "uninhibited communications" ===
Encryption supports this mode of communication by allowing people to protect the integrity, [[availability]] and confidentiality of their communications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The requirement of uninhibited communications is an important precondition for freedom of communication, which is acknowledged by constitutional courts e.g. [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]]&lt;ref&gt;See for example New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964) and Dombrowskiv. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; and the German [[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]&lt;ref&gt;See BVerfG NJW 1995, 3303 (3304) and BVerfG NJW 2006, 207 (209).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Cumhuryiet Vafki and others v. Turkey, ECHR 10.08.2013 - 28255/07; Ricci v. Italy, ECHR 10.08.2013 - 30210/06.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, meaningful communication requires people's ability to freely choose the pieces of information and develop their ideas, the style of language and select the medium of communication according to their personal needs. Uninhibited communication is also a [[precondition]] for autonomous personal development. Human beings grow their personality by communicating with others.&lt;ref name="Tarlach McGonagle p. 3"&gt;Tarlach McGonagle. The United Nations and Freedom of Expression and Information. chapter 1, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; UN's first Special Rapporteur on Privacy, professor Joe Cannataci, stated that ''"privacy is not just an enabling right as opposed to being an end in itself, but also an essential right which enables the achievement of an over-arching fundamental right to the free, unhindered development of one's personality"''.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy, Joseph A. Cannataci, A/HRC/31/64.&lt;/ref&gt; In case such communication is inhibited, the interaction is biased because a statement does not only reflect the speaker's true (innermost) personal views but can be unduly influenced by considerations that should not shape communication in the first place.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, the process of forming one's personality through [[Social relation|social interaction]] is disrupted. In a complex society freedom of speech does not become reality when people have the right to speak. A second level of guarantees need to protect the precondition of making use of the right to express oneself. If there is the risk of [[surveillance]] the right to protect one freedom of speech by means of encryption has to be considered as one of those second level rights. Thus, restriction of the availability and effectiveness of encryption as such constitutes an interference with the freedom of expression and the right to privacy as it protects private life and correspondence. Therefore, it has to be assessed in terms of [[legality]], necessity and purpose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Procedures and transparency ===
Freedom of expression and the right to privacy (including the right to private communications) materially protect a certain behavior or a personal state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is well established in fundamental rights theory that substantive rights have to be complemented by procedural guaranties to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Theory of Constitutional Rights|last=Alexy|first=Robert|last2=Rivers|first2=Julian|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those procedural guarantees can be rights such as the right to an effective remedy. However, it is important to acknowledge that those procedural rights must, similar to the substantive rights, be accompanied by specific procedural duties of governments without which the rights would erode. The substantial rights have to be construed in a way that they also contain the duty to make governance systems transparent, at least to the extent that allows citizens to assess who made a decision and what measures have been taken. In this aspect, transparency ensures accountability. It is the precondition to know about the dangers for fundamental rights and make use of the respective freedoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Security intermediaries ===
The effectuation of human rights protection requires the involvement of service providers. These service providers often act as [[Internet Intermediaries|intermediaries]] facilitating expression and communication of their users of different kinds.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon et al. UNESCO study; Cf. Karol Jakubowicz. Early days: the UN, ICTs and freedom of expression. in: The United Nations and Freedom of Expression and Information. chapter 10, pp. 324 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In debates about cryptographic policy, the question of lawful government access – and the conditions under which such access should take place in order to respect human rights – has a vertical and national focus. Complexities of [[jurisdiction]] in lawful government access are significant and present a still unsolved puzzle. In particular, there has been a dramatic shift from traditional lawful government access to [[digital communications]] through the targeting of telecommunications providers with strong local connections, to access through targeting over-the-top services with fewer or loose connections to the jurisdictions in which they offer services to users. In which cases such internationally operating service providers should (be able to) hand over user [[data]] and communications to local authorities. The deployment of encryption by service providers is a further complicating factor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

From the perspective of service providers, it seems likely that cryptographic methods will have to be designed to account for only providing user data on the basis of valid legal process in certain situations. In recent years, companies and especially online intermediaries have found themselves increasingly in the focus of the debate on the implementation of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 2011. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the UNESCO publication Fostering Freedoms Online. The Role of Internet Intermediaries. 2014. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002311/231162e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet intermediaries|Online intermediaries]]&lt;ref name="Tarlach McGonagle p. 3"/&gt; not only have a role of intermediaries between [[Content Providers|content providers]] and users but also one of "Security Intermediaries" in various aspects. Their practices and defaults as regards encryption are highly relevant to the user's access to and effective usage of those technologies. Since a great amount of data is traveling through their routers and is stored in their clouds, they offer ideal points of access for the intelligence community and [[non-state actor]]s. Thus, they also, perhaps involuntarily, function as an interface between the state and the users in matters of encryption policy. The role has to be reflected in the human rights debate as well, and it calls for a comprehensive integration of security of user information and communication in the emerging [[Internet governance]] model of today.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Human rights and encryption: obligations and room for action ===
UNESCO is working on promoting the use of legal assessments based on human rights in cases of interference with the freedom to use and deploy cryptographic methods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The concept of [[Internet Universality]], developed by UNESCO, including its emphasis on [[Openness of the Internet|openness]], [[Accessibility of the Internet|accessibility]] to all, and [[multi-stakeholder participation]]. While these minimal requirements and good practices can be based on more abstract legal analysis, these assessments have to be made in specific contexts. Secure authenticated access to publicly available content, for instance, is a safeguard against many forms of public and private [[censorship]] and limits the risk of falsification. One of the most prevalent technical standards that enables secure authenticated access is [[TLS termination proxy|TLS]]. Closely related to this is the availability of anonymous access to information. TOR is a system that allows the practically anonymous retrieval of information online. Both aspects of access to content directly benefit the freedom of thought and expression. The principle of [[legal certainty]] is vital to every juridical process that concerns cryptographic methods or practices. The principle is essential to any forms of interception and surveillance, because it can prevent unreasonable fears of surveillance, such as when the underlying legal norms are drafted precisely. Legal certainty may avert chilling effects by reducing an inhibiting key factor for the exercise of human rights, for UNESCO.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Continuous [[innovation]] in the field ofcryptography and setting and spreading new technical standards is therefore essential. Cryptographic standards can expire quickly as [[Computer performance|computing power]] increases . UNESCO has outlined that [[education]] and continuous [[Modernization theory|modernization]] of cryptographic techniques are important.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Legality of limitations ===

The impact of human rights can only be assessed by analyzing the possible limitations that states can set for those [[Political freedom|freedoms]]. UNESCO states that national security can be a legitimate aim for actions that limit freedom of speech and the [[right to privacy]], but it calls for actions that are necessary and proportional.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "UNESCO considers an interference with the right to encryption as a guarantee enshrined in the freedom of expression and in privacy as being especially severe if:

• It affects the ability of key service providers in the media and [[communication]]s landscape to protect their users' information and communication through secure cryptographic methods and protocols, thereby constituting the requirement of uninhibited communications for users of networked communication services and technologies.

• The state reduces the possibility of vulnerable [[Community|communities]] and/or [[Structure|structurally]] important actors like [[journalist]]s to get access to encryption;

• Mere [[Theory|theoretical]] risks and dangers drive restrictions to the relevant fundamental rights under the legal system of a state;

• The mode of state action, e.g. if restrictions on fundamental rights are established through informal and voluntary arrangements, lead to unaccountable circumvention or [[erosion]] of the security of deployed cryptographic methods and technologies."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Insurance Act 2015''' (2015 c.4) is a [[United Kingdom]] Act of Parliament which makes significant reforms to insurance law.&lt;ref&gt;Insurance Act 2015 - {{ISBN|9780105404156}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows on from the [[Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012]] ("CIDRA"). Both of these new Acts are a consequence of the [[Law Commission]]'s millennium review of the law of insurance in general, and of [[marine insurance]] in particular. The [[Marine Insurance Act 1906]] has been amended by these two new Acts.

==The Act's provisions==
'''Part 1'''
* The Insurance Act 2015 distinguishes between "consumer" and "non-consumer" insurance contracts. Parts 2 and 3 apply only to non-consumer insurance contracts. 

'''Part 2''' addresses the Duty of Fair Presentation.
* Section 3 imposes upon the insured "a duty to make a fair presentation of the risk" to the insurer. The insured must disclose  "(a) every material circumstance which the insured knows or ought to know, or (b) failing that, a disclosure which gives the insurer sufficient information to put a prudent insurer on notice that it needs to make further enquiries ..."  
* Section 4 defines what the insured knows or ought to know; and Section 5 defines the insurer's knowledge.

'''Part 3''' addresses "Warranties and other terms".  
* Section 9 provides that a representation made by the insured is '''not''' capable of being converted into a warranty.  
* Section 10 abolishes "any rule of law that a breach of warranty (express or implied) ... results in the discharge of the insurer's liability".  
* Section 11 provides that if the insured fails to comply with a term tending to reduce the risk, then the insurer may not rely on such breach if the non-compliance could not have increased the risk.

'''Part 4''' addresses "Fraudulent claims".

'''Part 5''' addresses "Good faith". 
* Section 14 provides that "any rule of law permitting a party to a contract of insurance to avoid the contract on the ground that the [[uberrimae fides|utmost good faith]] has not been observed by the other party is abolished". Accordingly, this section amends s.17 of the Marine Insurance Act 1906 to read: "A contract of marine insurance is a contract based upon the utmost good faith"; and that section's subsequent words: "and, if the utmost good faith be not observed by either party, the contract may be avoided by the other party" are now omitted.

There are two further parts containing ancillary provisions: '''Part 6''' and '''Part 7'''.

==Late payment of insurance claims==
Initially, the Insurance Act 2015 was to have contained provisions relating to damages for the late payment of insurance claims. However, these provisions were deemed to be too controversial to pass through the expedited parliamentary procedure for Law Commission bills.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Newby, Minister in charge of the Bill - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldselect/ldinsur/81/81.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They were later reinserted in Part 5 of the Enterprise Bill, which was introduced into Parliament on 16 September 2015 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubismlaw.com/cubism-news/late-payment-of-claims-by-insurers-in-the-enterprise-bill-2015/ "Late payment of claims by insurers in The Enterprise Bill 2015"], London, 12 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and passed into law on 4 May 2016. Clause 13A of the 2015 Act now states that:
:"It is an implied term of every contract of insurance that if the insured makes a claim under the contract, the insurer must pay any sums due in respect of the claim within a reasonable time. A reasonable time includes a reasonable time to investigate and assess the claim".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/12/part/5 Enterprise Act 2016], Clause 28&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Day of liberation of the Nazi concentration camps''' is  a memorable date, celebrated annually on 11 April.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msk.kprf.ru/2016/04/11/6954/ MSK]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War in Nazi Germany, its allies and countries in the occupied territories they acted (in addition to prisons, ghettos, and so on).&lt;ref&gt;[http://makeyevka.ru/1743-mezhdunarodnyj-den-osvobozhdeniya-uznikov-fashistskikh-kontslagerej Makeyvka]&lt;/ref&gt; Of 14 000 concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calend.ru/holidays/0/0/1007/ Международный день освобождения узников фашистских концлагерей — 11 апреля.

In March 1945, on the territory of Buchenwald (the largest concentration camp) flashes armed insurrection organized by international forces prisoners themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nicstyle.ru/prazdniki/den-osvobozhdeniya-uznikov-konclagerej.html 11 апреля — Международный день освобождения узников фашистских концлагерей]&lt;/ref&gt; When Buchenwald concentration camp includes the American troops, the rebels had already presided over a death camp. Largely because of this, the Nazis (SS guards) did not manage to cover up the traces of their horrible crimes and the testimony of prisoners reached the international Nuremberg Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news_enc.academic.ru/8673/Международный_день_освобождения_узников_фашистских_концлагерей  Энциклопедия ньюсмейкеров]&lt;/ref&gt; April 11 - the day of entry of American troops into the territory of Buchenwald - and was adopted by the United Nations as the date when the planet marks the International Day of liberation of Nazi concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rian.ru/society/20090410/167744197.html День освобождения узников фашистских концлагерей.

Total in the territories controlled by the Germans, was contained in concentration camps, death camps, prisons 18 000 000 people. Of these, more than 11 million were killed. Among the dead - 5 million citizens of the USSR, as well as 6 million Jews from different countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dilovamova.com/index.php?page=10&amp;holiday=72 Календар: Міжнародний день визволення в'язнів фашистських концтаборів]&lt;/ref&gt; Every fifth prisoner was a child (there are more terrible figures ''"contained more than 20 million people from 30 countries, 12 million did not live up to the release of"'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calend.ru/holidays/0/0/1007/ Международный день освобождения узников фашистских концлагерей]&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Julius von Ficker''', or '''Johann Kaspar Julius Ficker von Feldhaus''' (30 April 1826 – 10 June 1902) was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Germans|German]] [[historian]]. In 1898 he was awarded the [[Pour le Mérite]] for Sciences and Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orden-pourlemerite.de/mitglieder/johann-kaspar-julius-ficker-von-feldhaus?m=3&amp;u=4&amp;p=3 Johann Kaspar Julius Ficker von Feldhaus] Orden Pour le Mérite für Wissenschaften und Künste ([[Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts]]) (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Born at [[Paderborn]], Ficker studied history and law at [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of Münster|Münster]], and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], and during 1848-49 lived in [[Frankfurt]], where he was closely associated with the noted historian, [[Johann Friedrich Böhmer]], who proved himself a generous friend and patron. In 1852 he proceeded to Bonn, but shortly afterwards accepted an invitation from Count [[Leopold Thun-Hohenstein]], the reorganizer of the [[Austria]]n system of education, to settle at [[Leopold-Franzens-Universität Innsbruck|Innsbruck]] as professor of general history. In 1863, however, he joined the faculty of jurisprudence, and his lectures on political and legal history drew around him a large circle of devoted and admiring pupils. In 1866 he was elected member of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]], but retired, after being ennobled by the Emperor of Austria, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], in 1879.

==The Sybel-Ficker controversy==
During the period 1859-1866, triggered by the publication of [[Wilhelm von Giesebrecht|Giesebrecht]]'s ''Geschichte der deutschen Kaiserzeit'', he was engaged in a literary controversy with the historian, [[Heinrich von Sybel]], on the significance of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Ficker advocated and defended the theory that Austria, on account of its blending of races, was best fitted as successor of the old empire to secure the political advancement both of Central Europe and of Germany. In support of his theory, he wrote ''Das deutsche Kaiserreich in seinen universalen und nationalen Beziehungen'' (Innsbruck, 1871), and ''Deutsches Königtum und Kaisertum'' (Innsbruck, 1872). As legatee of Böhmer's literary estate, he published the ''Acta Imperii selecta'' (lnnsbruck, 1870) and directed the completion and revision of the ''[[Regesta Imperii]]''.

Julius von Ficker died in Innsbruck.

His sons were also prominent. [[Ludwig von Ficker]] (1880-1967) was a publisher and essayist who promoted and published the work of his friend, [[Georg Trakl]]. [[Heinrich von Ficker]] (1881-1957) was a meteorologist, geophysicist and explorer. [[Rudolf von Ficker]] (1886-1954) was a musicologist.

==Works==
Ficker's numerous and important works extend over three branches of scientific history: political and legal history and the science of [[diplomatics]]. In each division he discovered new methods of investigation. Among his writings those of especial note are:

===Political history===
*''[[Rainald of Dassel|Rainald von Dassel]], Reichskanzler und [[Archbishopric of Cologne|Erzbischof von Köln]]'' (Cologne, 1850)
*''Münsterische Chroniken des Mittelalters'' (Münster, 1851)
*''[[Engelbert II of Berg|Engelbert der Heilige]], Erzbischof von Köln'' (Cologne, 1853)
*''Die Überreste des deutschen Reichsarchivs in [[Pisa]]'' (Vienna, 1855).

===Legal history===
*''Über einen Spiegel deutscher Leute'' (Vienna, 1857)
*''Über die Entstehungszeit des [[Sachsenspiegel]]s'' (Innsbruck 1859)
*''Vom Reichsfürstenstande'' (Innsbruck, 1861)
*''Forschungen zur Reichs- und Rechtsgeschichte [[Italy|Italiens]]'' (4 vols., Innsbruck, 1868–74)
*''Untersuchungen zur Rechtsgeschichte'' (3 vols., Innsbruck, 1891–97).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3844">'''Law of the Horse''' was a term used in the mid-1990s to define the state of [[cyberlaw]] during the nascent years of the Internet.

The term first gained prominence in a 1996 cyberlaw conference presentation by Judge [[Frank H. Easterbrook]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]]. Easterbrook, who was also on the faculty of the [[University of Chicago]], later published his presentation in the University of Chicago Legal Forum as "Cyberspace and the Law of the Horse", in which he argued against the notion of defining cyberlaw as a unique section of legal studies and litigation.&lt;ref name="harmon" /&gt; Easterbrook cited [[Gerhard Casper]] as coining the expression “law of the horse,” and stated that Casper’s arguments against specialized or niche legal studies applied to cyberlaw:
{{quote|...the best way to learn the law applicable to specialized endeavors is to study general rules. Lots of cases deal with sales of horses; others deal with people kicked by horses; still more deal with the licensing and racing of horses, or with the care veterinarians give to horses, or with prizes at horse shows. Any effort to collect these strands into a course on 'The Law of the Horse' is doomed to be shallow and to miss unifying principles.&lt;ref name="easterbrook" /&gt;}}

Easterbrook’s theory was challenged by [[Lawrence Lessig]], a professor at [[Harvard Law School]], in an April 1997 article "The Law of the Horse: What Cyberlaw Might Teach."&lt;ref name="lessig" /&gt; Lessig’s article, which was first presented at the [[Boston University Law School]] Faculty Workshop, argued that legal perceptions and rules would need to evolve as the cyberspace environment developed and expanded.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fausett" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17132">{{Politics of the Holy See}}
The '''legal status of the Holy See''', the [[Holy See|ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Catholic Church in Rome]], both in [[Sources of international law#State practice|state practice]] and according to the writing of modern legal scholars, is that of a full subject of [[public international law]], with rights and duties analogous to those of [[Sovereign state|States]].

==A ''sui generis'' entity possessing international personality==
Although the Holy See, as distinct from the [[Vatican City]] State, does not fulfill the long-established criteria in international law of [[Sovereign state|statehood]]; i.e. having a permanent population, a defined territory, a stable government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states;&lt;ref&gt;The criteria for statehood were first authoritatively enunciated at the [[Montevideo Convention]] on Rights and Duties of States, signed on 26 December 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; its possession of full [[legal personality]] in [[international law]] is evidenced by its diplomatic relations with 180 states, that it is a ''member-state'' in various intergovernmental international organizations, and that it is: "respected by the international community of sovereign States and treated as a subject of international law having the capacity to engage in diplomatic relations and to enter into binding agreements with one, several, or many states under international law that are largely geared to establish and preserving peace in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Araujo and John Lucal, Papal Diplomacy and the Quest for Peace, the Vatican and International Organizations from the early years to the League of Nations, Sapienza Press (2004), {{ISBN|1-932589-01-5}}, p. 16. ''See also'' James Crawford, The Creation of States in International Law, (1979) p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; As Graham notes:

{{quotation|The fact that the Holy See is a non-territorial institution is no longer regarded as a reason for denying it international personality. The papacy can act in its own name in the international community. It can enter into legally binding conventions known as concordats. In the world of diplomacy the Pope enjoys the rights of active and passive legation. (...) Furthermore, this personality of the Holy See is distinct from the personality of the State of Vatican City. One is a non-territorial institution and the other a state. The papacy as a religious organ is a subject of international law and capable of international rights and duties.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graham, Vatican Diplomacy, A Study of Church and State on the International Plane (1959) pp. 186, 201&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This peculiar character of the Holy See in international law, as a non-[[territorial entity]] with a legal personality akin to that of states, has led professor [[Ian Brownlie]] to define it as a "''sui generis'' entity".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law, 4th ed. {{ISBN|0-19-825639-6}} (1990) p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-perception of the Holy See==
Moreover, the Holy See itself, while claiming international legal personality, does not claim to be a State. Cardinal [[Jean-Louis Tauran]], former [[Secretary for Relations with States]] of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]] of the Holy See, has underlined that we must avoid the temptation of assimilating the Holy See and its international action with that of a State, with their thirst for power.  For him, the Holy See is unquestionably a sovereign subject of international law but of a predominantly religious nature.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Louis Tauran, "Etica e ordine mondiale: l’apporto specific della Santa Sede", in Giulio Cipollone, ''La Chiesa e l’ordine internationale'', Roma: Gangemi Editore (2004) p. 184. (Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The legal basis of the Holy See's international personality==
For some authors, the current legal personality of the Holy See is a remnant of its preeminent role in medieval politics. Thus Arangio-Ruiz noted that the Holy See has been an actor in the evolution of international law since before the creation of strong nation states, and that it has maintained international personality since.&lt;ref&gt;Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz, Revue Belge de Droit International, 29 (1996) 354.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
For others, the international personality of the Holy See arises solely from its recognition by other states.  In this sense, [[Ian Brownlie|Brownlie]] argues that the personality of the Holy See “as a religious organ apart from its territorial base in the Vatican City” arises from the "principle of effectiveness", that is, from the fact that other states voluntarily recognize the Holy See, acquiesce having bilateral relations with it, and in fact do so, in a situation where no rule of ''[[ius cogens]]'' is breached.  For him, though, the international personality thus conferred is effective only towards those states prepared to enter into diplomatic relations with it.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law, 4th ed. {{ISBN|0-19-825639-6}} (1990) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Crawford (jurist)|Crawford]] similarly believes that the recognition of a number of states is important evidence to acknowledge the legal personality of the Holy See, so that, today, it cannot be denied.&lt;ref&gt;See James Crawford, pp. 158-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a third group of authors, the international legal personality of the Holy See is based mostly, but not only, on its unique spiritual role. [[Robert Araujo (Jurist)|Araujo]] notes, for instance, that "it is generally understood that the Holy See’s international personality emerges from its religious, moral and spiritual authority and mission in the world as opposed to a claim over purely temporal matters. This is an incomplete understanding, however, of the grounds on which its claim as a subject of international law can be justified", since, in his view, the Holy See’s claim to international personality can also be justified  by the fact that it is recognized by other states as a full subject of international law.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Araujo and John Lucal, Papal Diplomacy and the Quest for Peace, the Vatican and International Organizations from the early years to the League of Nations, Sapienza Press (2004), {{ISBN|1-932589-01-5}}, pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lateran Treaty]] itself seems to support this view. In article 2, Italy recognized "the sovereignty of the Holy See in the international domain as an attribute inherent in its nature, in accordance with its tradition and with the requirements of its mission in the world."

For a further group, the legal personality of the Holy See in international law arises from the [[Lateran Treaty]], which, in their view, conferred international standing to the central government of the Catholic Church. In this sense, Oppenheim argued that "the previously controversial international position of the Holy See was clarified as the result of the Treaty of 11 February 1929, between the Holy See and Italy - the so called Lateran Treaty. (...) The Lateran Treaty marks the resumption of the formal membership, interrupted in 1871, of the Holy See in the society of states."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Yewdall Jennings]] and [[Arthur Watts (lawyer)|Arthur Watts]], Oppenheim's International Law, v.1 Peace, 9th ed., (1992) {{ISBN|978-0-582-50108-9}}, pp. 324-325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oppenheim goes further and denies a separate legal personality for the Vatican City State. For him, the composite of the Holy See plus the Vatican City constitutes just one international person; ''see'' p.&amp;nbsp;328:

{{quotation|The strict view ought probably to be that the Lateran Treaty created a new international state of the Vatican City, with the incumbent of the Holy See as its Head; but the practice of states does not always sharply distinguishes between the two elements in that way. Nevertheless it is accepted that in one form or the other there exists a state possessing the formal requirements of statehood and constituting an international person recognized as such by other states.}}

Kunz sharply criticized this view. For him:

{{quotation|The Lateran Treaty had the object of liquidating once for all the '[[Roman Question]]' and bringing about a reconciliation between the Holy See and Italy, but in no way created or changed the international position of the Holy See. (It is therefore not correct, as Oppenheim (...) states that "the hitherto controversial international position of the Holy See was clarified as a result of the Treaty.") The treaty concluded between the Holy See and Italy pre-supposses the international personality of the Holy See.&lt;ref&gt;Kunz, "The Status of the Holy See in International Law" 46 American Journal of International Law (1952) pp. 309-313&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Status between 1870 and 1929==
A separate question is whether the Holy See was a subject of international law between 1870, when the Kingdom of [[Italy]] annexed the [[Papal States]], and 1929, when the Lateran Treaties were signed. The United States, for instance, suspended diplomatic relations with the Holy See when it lost the Papal States.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Araujo and John Lucal, Papal Diplomacy and the Quest for Peace, the Vatican and International Organizations from the early years to the League of Nations, Sapienza Press (2004), {{ISBN|1-932589-01-5}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[L. F. L. Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] believed that the legal personality of the Papal States became extinct in 1870. For him, between 1870 and 1929, the "Holy See was not an international person," although "it had by custom and tacit consent of most states acquired a quasi-international position".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts, Oppenheim's International Law, v.1 Peace, 9th ed., (1992) {{ISBN|978-0-582-50108-9}}, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations [[International Law Commission]] noted, nonetheless, that:

{{quotation|It has always been a principle of international law that entities other than States might possess international personality and treaty-making capacity. An example is afforded by the Papacy particularly in the period immediately preceding the Lateran Treaty of 1929, when the Papacy exercised no territorial sovereignty. The Holy See was nevertheless regarded as possessing international treaty-making capacity. Even now, although there is a Vatican State (...) treaties are entered into not by reason of territorial sovereignty over the Vatican State, but on behalf of the Holy See, which exists separately from that State.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations International Law Commission, Commentary to Article 2 of the Vienna Convention on Treaties, 2 ILC Yearbook, p. 96, quoted in: Robert Araujo and John Lucal, ''Papal Diplomacy and the Quest for Peace, the Vatican and International Organizations from the early years to the League of Nations'', Sapienza Press (2004), {{ISBN|1-932589-01-5}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, Kunz argued that:

{{quotation|Prior to 1870, there were two subjects of international law: the Papal State and the Holy See. (...) Of these two persons in international law the one, the Papal State, undoubtedly came to an end, under the rules of general international law, by the Italian conquest and subjugation in 1870. But the Holy See remained, as always, a subject of general international law also in the period between 1870 and 1929. That this is so, is fully proved by the practice of states. The Holy See continued to conclude concordats and continued, with the consent of a majority of states, to exercise the active and passive right of legation. The legal position of its diplomatic agents (...) remained based on general international law, not on the Italian Law of Guarantee, a municipal law.&lt;ref&gt;Kunz, "The Status of the Holy See in International Law" 46 American Journal of International Law (1952) pp. 309-313. Crawford, p. 157, noted that: "Though some writers denied that the Holy See had any international standing at all after 1870, the true position is that it retained after the annexation of the Papal States what it always had, a degree of international personality, measured by the extent of its existing legal rights and duties, together with its capacity to conclude treaties and to receive and accredit envoys."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Opposition to the Holy See's participation in multilateral forums==
Since 1995, the [[NGO|non-governmental organization]] [[Catholics for Choice]] has advocated against the participation of the Holy See in multilateral forums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seechange.org/ See Change, Why is this campaign important?]&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that the Holy See is a religious organization and not a state, and that, therefore, it should have neither a special status in international law nor the right to participate, in a position analogous to that of states, in the international conferences on social, cultural and economic matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/topics/reform/documents/2001seechangebriefingpaper.pdf Seechange, The Catholic Church at the United Nations, Church or State?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127042939/http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/topics/reform/documents/2001seechangebriefingpaper.pdf |date=2008-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No State has supported this initiative. On the contrary, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] confirmed and raised further the status of the Holy See as an [[observer status|observer]] within the UN, through its [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/58/314&amp;Lang=E Resolution 58/314] of 16 July 2004.&lt;ref name=Espresso&gt;{{cite news

From its establishment in 1966 to its demise in the early 1980s, the [[Guardian's Office]] (GO) of the [[Church of Scientology]] carried out numerous covert operations and programs against a range of perceived opponents of [[Scientology]] in the [[United States]] and around the world. The GO sought to discredit, destroy or otherwise neutralize – or "depower", in Scientology jargon – any group or individual that it regarded as anti-Scientology. Instructions for such operations were distributed in the form of individually numbered "Guardian Program Orders", abbreviated as GPgmOs, which were distributed from the GO leadership to GO branches in Churches of Scientology and ultimately used to task agents.

==Operations==

===Operation Big Mouth===
'''Operation Big Mouth''' was a plan devised by the GO to discredit [[Nathan Dodell]], an [[Assistant US Attorney]] who represented the government in several cases involving Scientology. Dodell was believed by the GO to be "assiduously collecting files on Scientology to show (a) harassment of the U.S. government [by Scientologists] and (b) violations of the law by Scientology." Jimmy Mulligan, an assistant to [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s wife and GO head [[Mary Sue Hubbard]], instructed GO agents to "finally and terminatedly handle Mr. Dodell. He has been on our lines for many, many years. I would like for you to have very accurate and complete surveys done on him in D.C., and mock up and carry out some very professional, smooth, ops [operations] which will depower him fully." The Guardian's Office later concluded that it would be necessary to prove that Dodell was guilty of criminal conduct before the Church of Scientology could get him fired.&lt;ref name="Bredemeier"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bredemeier|first=Kenneth|title=Scientologists Plotted Leak Campaign|url=http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/washingtonpost/leaks-112479.htm|work=The Washington Post|date=November 24, 1979|accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; GO agents repeatedly burglarized Dodell's office in the US Courthouse in Washington, D.C. and copied reams of documents about Scientology.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Timothy S.|title=Agents Search Scientology Offices for U.S. Documents|url=http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/washingtonpost/raids-070977.htm|work=The Washington Post|date=July 9, 1977|accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Bulldozer Leak===
'''Operation Bulldozer Leak''' (July 21, 1976) was designed to "effectively spread the rumor that will lead Government, media, and individual SPs [Suppressive Persons] to conclude that LRH [L. Ron Hubbard] has no control of the C of S [the Church of Scientology] and no legal liability for church activity." Assistant Guardians in all branches of the GO were ordered "to spread the rumor" via agents working undercover, who were to approach government officials, journalists and others who had been critical of Scientology. An agent "will in several different ways mention that he has heard that LRH no longer has any control of the Church; and that an ex-Scientologist has shown some articles ... that stated that it had definitely been established in several court cases precedents that LRH had no liability for any Church activity." If contacts could not be seen personally, they were to be telephoned "and the cover story and rumor given." The agents were provided with sample scripts which included lines such as: "So while the press likes to ride with the one-leader idea so as to make press, they could not be further from the truth." The plan envisaged using Scientologists as fake authors who would interview government officials and then casually mention that they'd "heard that LRH no longer has any control of the church."&lt;ref name="Bredemeier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;{{cite news|last=Marshall|first=John|title=Hubbard still gave orders, records show|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/scientology/canada/canada5.html|work=The Globe and Mail|date=January 24, 1980|accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Bunny Bust===
'''Operation Bunny Bust''' (July 15, 1976) was a covert operation mounted against Bette Orsini, a reporter with the ''[[St Petersburg Times]]'' newspaper in [[Florida]]. She had been undertaking a major investigation of Scientology in the early part of 1976 and had come to the GO's attention via its agent in the [[Internal Revenue Service]], who came across her requests for information from the government.&lt;ref name="Stafford-Pt9"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stafford|first=Charles|title=Operation Bunny Bust|url=http://lisatrust.freewinds.cx/Media/video/print/spt-series9.htm|work=St. Petersburg Times|year=1980|accessdate=July 7, 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A weekly report sent from Dick Weigand to Mo Budlong stated:

{{quote|Situation: St. Pete Times reporter Bette Orsini has been covertly attacking us by continuing her investigation toward a possible entheta [unfavorable] article on Scn [Scientology] tax situation.

Why: Br I Base has been collecting data on her only and not attacking.&lt;ref name="Stafford-Pinellas" /&gt;}}

To resolve this, Joe Lisa, the assistant guardian for information at Scientology's [[Flag Land Base]], proposed a plan codenamed Operation Information "to get Bette Orsini removed from a position of power and attack" at the ''Times''. An agent posing as an aide to a Mafia figure would go to the ''Times'' office and leave $100 for Orsini, implying that it was a payoff to her for providing the Mafia with information from the newspaper's files. This plan was, however, apparently not attempted.&lt;ref name="Stafford-Pt9" /&gt;

In July 1976, the GO initiated Operation Bunny Bust – an effort to attack Orsini via a charity group, the Easter Seal Society for Crippled Children and Adults, for which her husband Andrew worked as executive secretary.&lt;ref name="Stafford-Pt9" /&gt; The GO discovered that the Easter Seal Society had forgotten to file an annual report with the Florida state authorities. This provided an opening for it to attack the Society, and by extension the Orsinis.&lt;ref name="Stafford-Pinellas" /&gt; [[Dick Weigand]] wrote to [[Mo Budlong]] to inform him: "A project has been drawn up and is now being implemented to show Easter Seal Society that Orsini (the executive secretary) has been operating as a fraud and has broken laws. This data is intended for a PR (public relations) attack." In November 1976, the GO began to mail an anonymous letter to various newspapers in Florida and to the St. Petersburg Consumer Affairs Department, the St. Petersburg Charitable Solicitations Board and the state attorney's office. Purportedly from a wealthy businessman, it complained that "an exhaustive independent probe" had found that the Easter Seal Society's financial and administrative affairs had been criminally mismanaged and called for the arrest and prosecution of Andrew Orsini.

The attack backfired when it was traced back to the Church of Scientology, and none of the newspapers to whom the letter had been sent ever published stories about the anonymous allegations.&lt;ref name="Stafford-Pinellas" /&gt; Bette Orsini found that a Scientologist named Ben A. Shaw had recently purchased copies of the Easter Seal Society's files from the Division of Licensing in Miami. He had misrepresented himself as a reporter for a University of Florida newspaper but was in fact an administrative assistant to the president of the Church of Scientology of Florida. When he was subpoenaed, he denied writing the anonymous letter or having any knowledge about it but he could not explain what he had done or was planning to do with the information that he had obtained. Orsini's investigations led her to two other Scientologists, who worked for the Clearwater Chamber of Commerce and the ''[[Clearwater Sun]]'' newspaper; both of them were undercover agents working for the GO. The agents had previously been involved in other Scientology covert operations. Weigand noted with concern that "the chain does lead to Orsini uncovering a Church operative network that could be used as a handle for a Grand Jury investigation of the Church activities which would include the Meisner/Silver scene [the Scientology agent who had infiltrated the IRS]." Before Orsini could take matters further, however, the FBI launched a massive raid on Scientology offices which led to the exposure of Operation Bunny Bust and the indictment and eventual conviction of 11 Scientologists, including Weigand and Budlong.&lt;ref name="Stafford-Pt9" /&gt;

===Operation Cat===
'''Operation Cat''' (September 16, 1975) was a plan to "make a mockery and hold up to ridicule the computer, the security services and authority {{sic}} in relation to FOI [Freedom of Information]" by "plant[ing] grossly false information in governmental agencies, especially security services files, for later public retrieval and ridiculing exposure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stafford|first=Charles|title=Church moves to defend itself against 'attackers'|url=http://lisatrust.freewinds.cx/Media/video/print/spt-series4.htm|work=St. Petersburg Times|year=1980|accessdate=July 7, 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective was "to hold up the American security to ridicule, as outlined in the GO by LRH." Written by [[David Gaiman]], the Deputy Guardian for Public Relations Worldwide, the plan called for Scientology "to take a cat with a pedigree name, or some such and to get the name into a computer file, together with a record whether it be criminal social welfare, driving or whatever; and to build the sequence of events to the point where the creature holds a [[press conference]] and photographic story results." The "production targets" of the operation were to plant dossiers in four US government agencies, hold a press conference and achieve four [[national media]] articles and 50 local articles by February 20, 1976. The planning document for the operation was one of those seized by the FBI in its July 1977 raids against Scientology, and was subsequently entered as "Government Exhibit No. 5" in the case against Guardian [[Jane Kember]] and other senior GO staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaiman|first=David|title=Operation CAT|url=http://lisatrust.freewinds.cx/legal/snowwhite/kember-exhibit-05.pdf|date=September 16, 1975|accessdate=July 7, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030625173711/http://lisatrust.freewinds.cx/legal/snowwhite/kember-exhibit-05.pdf|archivedate=June 25, 2003|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kember-Sentencing"&gt;{{cite web|title=United States of America v.

===Operation Chaos Leak===
'''Operation Chaos Leak''' (April 1976) sought to attack the [[US Department of Justice]] (DoJ) and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) by leaking a confidential DoJ internal report on the DEA. The plan envisaged causing "maximum chaos" to the DoJ and DEA by carrying out the leak and included elaborate details on how to leak the document without it being traced back to the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref name="Bredemeier" /&gt; The plan was concocted by [[Cindy Raymond]], in the aftermath of Scientology losing a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] lawsuit against the DEA. The GO believed that causing a public scandal would discredit the DEA and make it more likely that an appeal court judge would rule in favour of Scientology. Scientologist covert agent [[Michael Meisner]] stole a copy of the report from the DoJ and gave half of it to the ''[[Village Voice]]'' newspaper in [[New York City]], pretending to be a disaffected DoJ employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = A Piece of Blue Sky | url= http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/dst/www/Library/Shelf/atack/bs5-2.htm | page=233 | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-8184-0499-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation China Shop===
'''Operation China Shop''' (1975) was a plan to take over the ''Clearwater Sun'' newspaper in [[Clearwater, Florida]] by disrupting it and discrediting its reporters and editors. The newspaper had frequently been critical of the Church of Scientology, which had established its headquarters in Clearwater in controversial circumstances. Scientology responded by launching an operation to neutralize the newspaper; in a November 10, 1975 letter, Deputy Guardian US [[Henning Heldt]] wrote:

{{quote|A study of the paper does not show a political or intelligence angle.  Only evidence that the paper attacks everyone.  Any Good News is converted to attack. This paper (''Clearwater Sun'') may influence the two other papers that have offices in Clearwater (''St. Petersburg Times'' and ''Tampa Tribune'', I believe) or these two influence the ''Sun''.

The only conclusion that can be drawn is that somewhere in the editorial structure they have an institutional case - a has been one or a should be one. For it is a characteristic of insanity to attack everything...

Our target on this, very confidentially, is ownership or control of the paper. So, as you know, the finance information on the paper, its debts, its income (and how it could be cut) are prime information needs.&lt;ref&gt;"RE:  CHINA SHOP:  CLEARWATER SUN", letter from Henning Heldt to Dick Weigand, November 10, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Heldt ordered Guardian's Office staff to collect evidence on ''Sun'' personnel including publisher John Ricketson, former editor Al Hutchison and then managing editor Ron Stuart. The GO successfully infiltrated an agent, identified as "Molly Gilliam", into the ''Sun'' and obtained detailed reports on internal discussions at the newspaper. The ''Sun's'' news and advertising departments were infiltrated to obtain information on the paper's finances and employees in conjunction with an operation called the "Sunrise Mission". The goal was to research the ''Sun's'' advertising policies, its principal advertisers and their business with the ''Sun'', and the value of the newspaper's holdings, in order to determine whether the Church of Scientology could buy out the newspaper. The GO's agents were able to file almost daily reports on the ''Sun'' between January and October 1976, stealing files on advertising, finances, story outlines and legal correspondence. The items stolen included a 100-page computer printout about the newspaper's advertisers and records of its credit union. The GO was able to carry out a detailed financial analysis of the ''Sun's'' status using dozens of purloined revenue sheets and placed a value of $2.5 million on the newspaper.

As well as targeting the ''Sun'', the GO also sought to target its advertisers and employees to discredit them or, in the case of the advertisers, to convince them to stop buying space in the paper. Operation China Shop included a plan to get the ''Sun's'' largest advertiser, the Maas Brothers department store, to pull its adverts by claiming that a ''Sun'' reporter "is looking into their back-grounds to print something sordid on them." A GO staff member reported: "I understand that Maas Brothers is the largest account in the ''Clearwater Sun'' and that they put about $400,000 into the ''Sun'' annually. If they were to pull out, the Sun may have to fold."

Two ''Sun'' reporters, Mark Sableman and Steven Advokat, were reported on daily and editor Ron Stuart was targeted with a smear campaign accusing him of sexual misconduct and drug abuse. It was claimed that Stuart and others had dated a "nymphomaniac" and his divorce was also investigated. One GO document asserted that because he "spends very little money--- eats at McDonald's-- (it) seems that Stuart may have some large undisclosed crime that he needs extra money for." Another memo accused Stuart and ''Sun'' staffers of drug abuse at an editorial staff party in October 1976.

In addition, the GO compiled details of Clearwater residents who wrote letters to the ''Sun'' that criticised Scientology. In April 1976, the names, addresses and phone numbers of around 50 ''Sun'' readers were obtained from the newspaper. GO staff proposed to investigate the readers' backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leiby|first=Richard|title=Cult tried to control newspaper|url=http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/clearwatersun/cwsun-1124-1979.htm|work=Clearwater Sun|date=November 24, 1979|accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Craig|title=Scientologists planned to buy the Sun|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=December 1, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Cut Throat===
'''Operation Cut Throat''' was one of a number of operations against regional outlets of the [[Better Business Bureau]], in this case the [[St. Louis]] branch of the BBB. In July 1977, the FBI seized a number of documents "regarding infiltration and background information" about the St. Louis Better Business Bureau.&lt;ref name="Rawitch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rawitch|first=Robert|author2=Gillette, Robert|title=Church Wages Propaganda on a World Scale|url=http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/lat78.htm|date=August 27, 1978|accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operations Daniel and Dynamite===
{{main|Operation Freakout}}
[[File:Cooper bomb threat.gif|right|thumb|The second of the two forged bomb threats produced under Operation Dynamite]]
'''Operations Daniel''' and '''Dynamite''' were part of a years-long GO campaign against [[Paulette Cooper]], author of the 1971 book ''[[The Scandal of Scientology]]''. According to a GO "Intell[igence] US Weekly Report" of October 10, 1972, Operation Daniel was "wide-scale exposure of PC's sex life." During 1972, Cooper had faced an increasing campaign of harassment from Scientology; her name and phone number was posted on street walls so that she would receive obscene phone calls, and she was anonymously subscribed to pornographic mailing lists. She also received anonymous death threats and her neighbors received letters claiming that she had a [[venereal disease]].&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;{{cite news|last =Marshall|first =John|title =Files show spy reported woman's intimate words|work =[[The Globe and Mail]]|date =January 25, 1980  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following May, Cooper was indicted for making the bomb threats and arraigned for a Federal [[grand jury]]. Although the charges were dropped in 1975, it was not until 1977 that the FBI discovered that the bomb threats had been staged by the Guardian's Office.&lt;ref name="Kember-Sentencing" /&gt;

===Operation Devil's Wop===
'''Operation Devil's Wop''' (April 7, 1977) was a GO covert operation against Senator [[Dennis DeConcini]] of Arizona, who was a supporter of anti-cult groups. Dick Weigand, the Deputy Guardian for Information US, ordered GO staff to prepare a report on DeConcini that would be leaked to the press to link him, falsely, with organized crime figures and questionable real estate deals. In June 1977, GO agent Michael Meisner was given the task of writing the report on account of his knowledge of the Washington, D.C. political scene and his previous dealings with the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stafford|first=Charles|title=Scientologists' downfall began with phony IDs|url=http://lisatrust.freewinds.cx/Media/video/print/spt-series12.htm|work=St. Petersburg Times|year=1980|accessdate=July 7, 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSH-SentencingMemo"&gt;{{cite web|title=United States of America vs Mary Sue Hubbard et al.

===Operation Fickle===
'''Operation Fickle''' was a proposed plan to attack Eugene Patterson, editor and president of the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' newspaper. The paper had been highly critical of Scientology for several years; in retaliation, the GO sought to discredit Patterson. According to GO official Randy Windment, Patterson had been nominated as the successor to Times Publishing Company owner Nelson Poynter, on condition that he would continue Poynter's policies. Windment proposed "to cast doubt upon Patterson and the actuality of his continuing" those policies so that Poynter would "separate Patterson from his source of power." A Scientologist operating under cover would interview Patterson's wife and elicit answers that could be construed to oppose Poynter and his policies. The interview would be given to an "enemy paper" to "cause both Patterson and Poynter to be the laughing stocks of the newspaper world." However, the operation was disapproved by Greg Willardson, the Deputy Guardian Information U.S:

{{quote|I'm not at all certain this OP, even if done all the way through without bugs, would have enough of an affect {{sic}} to make it worth the resources expended. ... Would anyone really be interested in such a story, and if so I think that media person would check directly with Mrs. Patterson to discuss the 'controversy' at which point Mrs. Patterson would deny that she meant such and such and would say it was taken out of context and then the story would crumble.&lt;ref name="Stafford-Pinellas"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stafford|first=Charles|title=Scientologists' targets in Pinellas listed in files|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yBQOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=g3wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4819%2C1632098|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=November 3, 1979|accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Operation Freakout===
''See [[Operation Freakout]].''

===Operation Funny Bone===
[[File:Berrys world.gif|Right|thumb|The "Berry's World" cartoon from April 1977 that prompted Operation Funny Bone]]
'''Operation Funny Bone''' (April 28, 1977) was initiated in retaliation against syndicated newspaper cartoonist [[Jim Berry (cartoonist)|Jim Berry]], who penned a cartoon that poked fun at Scientology and other fringe belief groups. L. Ron Hubbard ordered GO operative Dick Weigand to start an operation to "disenfranchise" Berry. The operation, as Weigand noted in a memo sent on May 28, 1977, "was done off a recent LRH order to myself, so needless to say I want the actions done fast." The objective of the operation was to "cause Jim Berry to lose his sindicated {{sic}} publication so that he can no longer SP [Suppressive Person] Scientology." The plan was to obtain back issues of the ''[[Berry's World]]'' cartoon and find particular cartoons that could be used by the GO to claim that Berry was a racist: "There should be many buttons of persons that are being pressed. e.g. a joke on Poles: a joke on Catholics: a joke on Jews: a joke on any ethnic groups: make a list of this person types or ethnics." Individual Scientologists were then to write to newspapers syndicating ''Berry's World'' to complain about the cartoons and asking them to drop Berry. They were also ordered to write to the leaders of ethnic groups urging them to protest about Berry's cartoons. There is no indication that the scheme was put into practice, although a Scientologist did contact Berry's syndicate to try to uncover information about the cartoonist. The details of the operation came to light after the planning documents were seized by the FBI in July 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stafford|first=Charles|title=Cartoon prompted 'Op Funny Bone'|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=November 27, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gerryarmstrong.org/50grand/cult/operation-funny-bone-1.html Operation Funny Bone planning documents]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Hydra===
'''Operation Hydra''' was a Guardian's Office campaign to rid libraries across the United States of books and other literature that showed Scientology in a bad light. According to a former GO operative who participated in the campaign in Massachusetts, books were stolen from libraries across New England and hidden behind a false wall in the Scientology building in Boston. They were said to have been destroyed in 1977 along with incriminating documents about other GO activities following raids by the FBI against church offices in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology defectors charge 'dirty tricks' in Boston|last=Bradlee Jr.|first=Ben|work=The Boston Globe|date=May 31, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Italian Fog===
'''Operation Italian Fog''' was an attempt to smear [[Gabriel Cazares]], the mayor of [[Clearwater, Florida]], in order to "discredit" him and "weaken his power in his attacking actions at the [Scientology] Base." The plan was set out by Guardian's Office member Bruce Raymond in a letter of March 23, 1976 that stated:

{{quote|The purpose of this op is to actually get real documentation into the files of Mexican license bureau or bureaux stating that the mayor got married in Mexico to some Mexican gal 25 years ago who is not his wife, so puts the mayor in a position of bigamy. This can be accomplished either by a bribe or a covert action. Once the docs are planted it is cleverly exposed that the mayor is promiscuous and a bigamist.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Bruce. "Op Italian Fog". March 23, 1976. Quoted in Stafford, Charles. ''Church Played Dirty Tricks on Cazares''. St. Petersburg Times special report, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A plan of action was written on April 9, stating:

{{quote|As part of the security, if a bribe is used data should be given to the person accepting the bribe to pinpoint a false Who in his mind, ideally one of the Mayor's known enemies so that if the Op gets blown up to the person who was bribed that person would give data on the planted Who and S. [Scientology] would never come up.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Stafford, Charles. ''Church Played Dirty Tricks on Cazares''. St. Petersburg Times special report, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Operation Juicy Clanger===
'''Operation Juicy Clanger''' targeted tax records of prominent politicians and celebrities. Scientology operatives infiltrated the Los Angeles offices of the IRS and stole confidential files on California's governor [[Jerry Brown]], Los Angeles' mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], the singer [[Frank Sinatra]] and the actress [[Doris Day]], as well as attempting to steal [[John Wayne]]'s tax records.&lt;ref name="GM-1980-01-22"&gt;{{cite news|title=Big FBI raid led to conspiracy trial of cult leaders|work=Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|last=Marshall|first=John|date=January 22, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church appears to have intended to blackmail the IRS;&lt;ref name="Wright2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Lawrence|title=Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lo21NAEACAAJ|year=2013|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-70066-7|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; the operation envisaged the church pretending that it had received the stolen tax records from a whistleblower and threatening to release them to create what the plans described as "an additional pressure on [the IRS] to finish the audit [of Scientology tax matters] favorably".&lt;ref name="GM-1980-01-22" /&gt;

===Operation Keeler===
[[File:Beach Drive in Rock Creek Park.jpg|thumb|Rock Creek Park, Washington D.C., where Operation Keeler's fake road accident was staged]]
'''Operation Keeler''' was a bid to smear Gabriel Cazares, the mayor of Clearwater, Florida, by staging a fake road accident in Washington, D.C. while he was in the company of a young woman Scientologist. The intention was to manufacture a scandal that would derail Cazares' bid to win a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. When the Guardian's Office discovered that Cazeres would be attending a national mayors' conference in Washington between March 13–17, it put into place a plan to entrap the mayor in a staged scandal. A GO official informed Duke Snider, one of those later imprisoned on conspiracy charges, that he was "having DC put together fast a report on the upcoming conference primarily where it will be and when (in detail) and locate where Cazares will be staying. I am now working on a set of Ops [operations] type actions which could be done to welcome the mayor to the capital." The operation, codenamed "Op Keeler", was reported back to [[Mo Budlong]] by [[Dick Weigand]], the Deputy Guardian Information US, in a letter of March 15, 1976:&lt;ref name="Stafford-Scientologists"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stafford|first=Charles|title=Scientologists sought sex smear of Cazares, their documents show|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2Q4OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fHwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4369%2C3481731|date=November 28, 1979|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[O]n either 13 March or 14 March, the Mayor picked up a young woman. On 14 March in the evening and after a few drinks, he had her take him for a ride on a dark and lonely road near D.C...

Both of the other people involved in the "accident" in [[Rock Creek Park]] were Scientologists; the woman was a Scientologist agent named Sharon Thomas, and the man was [[Michael Meisner]], who was later to play a key role in the Snow White scandal that eventually brought down the Guardian's Office.&lt;ref name="Miller-341"&gt;{{cite book | last=Miller | first=Russell | authorlink=Russell Miller | title=[[Bare-faced Messiah]], The True Story of L.

Ron Hubbard himself took a keen interest in Cazares and on the same day that Weigand's memo was sent, he sent a note to the GO: "Cazares - is there still some possibility the Cubans in Miami might get the idea he is pro-Castro?"&lt;ref name="Miller-341" /&gt;
    
On June 21, 1976 [[Don Alverso]], director of Branch I information for the Scientology Flag Land Base in Clearwater, wrote to Weigand to inform him of the plans for the next phase of the operation – a smear campaign based on the fake accident.&lt;ref name="Stafford-Scientologists" /&gt; He wrote:

{{quote|Attached is an op which I mocked up which should wreak havoc in and with Cazares' political machinery, and among the CW [Clearwater] people who support this criminal. ... [The plan is to write a letter] saying something to the following effect: Gabe Cazares was involved in a scandal when he was in Wash DC with some floozy and also in a hit-and-run accident. The girl is going to turn herself into the police. We could have another Washington sex scandal on our hands unless we do something about it quickly."&lt;ref name="Stafford-Scientologists" /&gt;}}

The letter was to be written on "a safe typewriter" and mailed from Washington to leading Democrats in [[Pinellas County]], as well as to the ''St. Petersburg Times'', the ''Clearwater Sun'', the ''[[Tampa Tribune]]'', newspapers in the state capital [[Tallahassee]] and Channel 13 news. The letter was duly sent in August 1976, signed "Sharon T.", and said:&lt;ref name="Stafford-Scientologists" /&gt;

{{quote|While driving around that night sightseeing with Gabe, we had an accident. We hit a man going around a sharp curve in the road and did not stop to see if he was hurt or even dead.

A GO agent initially offered damaging information on Cazares to his opponent's administrative assistant but was rebuffed.&lt;ref name="Lamont-70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamont|first=Stewart|authorlink=Stewart Lamont|title=[[Religion Inc.]]|page=70|publisher=Harrap|location=London|year=1986|ISBN=0-245-54334-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assistant Guardian Information Flag wrote on August 2, 1976 that "Op Keeler is presently underway and is expected to start getting effects on Cazares in the next few days." The desired objective, he explained, was to force Cazares "into a 'glutz' situation of constantly defending himself and his actions, and removing all of his attack statements (about the church) from local media lines. Force him to spend his campaign funds for his defense, not for his offense."&lt;ref name="Stafford-Scientologists" /&gt; To cover its tracks, the GO sent an anonymous letter to Cazeres' Republican opponent, Bill Young, claiming that the "Sharon T." letter was actually the work of the Cazares campaign and that he would claim it had been a dirty trick on Young's part. Young responded by turning the GO's letter over to the FBI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = [[A Piece of Blue Sky]] | page=225 | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-8184-0499-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cazares likewise called in the FBI to investigate the smear campaign.&lt;ref name="Lamont-70" /&gt;

Cazares was defeated in the congressional race on November 2, 1976.&lt;ref name="Lamont-70" /&gt; After the GO's files became public in 1979, he sued the Church of Scientology for invasion of privacy and malicious prosecution.

===Operation Kettle===
'''Operation Kettle''' was one of a number of operations carried out against the [[American Medical Association]], which had criticized Dianetics and Scientology on a number of occasions.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;{{dead link|date=October 2018}}

===Operation Oscar===
'''Operation Oscar''' (possibly alternatively known as the Oscar Program) was an operation carried out against Michael J. Flynn, a Boston attorney who was involved in a number of lawsuits against the Church of Scientology in the early 1980s. The operation sought to have Flynn disbarred and involved planting a Guardian's Office agent inside his law office for the purpose of gathering information.&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Janie Petersen to the City of Clearwater Commission Hearing on Scientology, May 8, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Orange Juice===
'''Operation Orange Juice''' (GPgmO 1114, April 27, 1977) was a plan to attack Florida State Representative Frank Williams, who was sponsoring a Psychological Practices Bill which could have restricted the activities of Scientology in Florida. The GO suspected that Williams was "obviously being pushed by some mental health individual" behind the scenes. It sought to "locate the WHO pushing for the Bill being made legislation, identify the Bill with the individual and take out the individual.  This will result in the Bill being killed." Individual Scientologists were to be used to operate in the guise of concerned professionals affected by the bill, who would lobby against its enactment and try to find out who was behind it. When the "[[John Doe]]" was found, "any and all crimes and embarrassing points" were to be uncovered in a bid to discredit him or it. Religious groups such as the "Baptists, Christian Scientists, Episcopalians, Methodists, Lutherans, Mormons, Jehovas Witnesses" and so on were to be contacted and urged to "send steaming letters  to their representatives from all over Florida to kill the "Doe" Bill."&lt;ref&gt;"CONFIDENTIAL: ORANGE JUICE", Guardian Programme Order GPgmO 1114, April 27, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Paris===
'''Operation Paris''' aimed to identify individual IRS officials working on Scientology tax matters and investigate their background and activities. A 'plant' would be recruited to develop social and political contacts with IRS personnel.&lt;ref name="CSC-9-24-1984" /&gt;

===Operation Paste Up===
'''Operation Paste Up''' was a campaign against mental health organizations, carried out with the use of front groups to stage demonstrations and stick up posters outside mental health facilities. The plan sought to create the appearance that many different groups across the United States were protesting, but specified that the protests were not to be linked with Scientology. One such protest took place outside a Utah hospital on December 13, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology's tactics for dissenters|last=McKee|first=Bob|date=June 22, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Random Harvest===
'''Operation Random Harvest''' sought to document criminal activity on the part of the IRS.&lt;ref name="CSC-9-24-1984" /&gt;

===Operation Rook===
'''Operation Rook''' was a GO campaign against the Better Business Bureau of [[Phoenix, Arizona]] at the start of the 1970s. According to one of the documents seized by the FBI from the Guardian's Office in 1977, the successes of Operation Rook included "successfully obtain[ing] Phoenix BBB file on Scientology and Arizona Republic Newspaper file on Scientology".&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Confidential: US Guardian Office Wins in 1970", 31 December 1970.

===Operation Search and Destroy=== 
'''Operation Search and Destroy''' targeted organizations and individuals providing information to the Internal Revenue Service. The GO would use overt or covert means to obtain information which could be used to discredit them, while avoiding any disclosure of Scientology's involvement. The GO had already obtained information on IRS informants and sought to expand its coverage.&lt;ref name="CSC-9-24-1984"&gt;Church of Scientology of California, Petitioner V.

===Operation Shake and Bake===
'''Operation Shake and Bake''' was a plan targeting LaVenda Van Schaick, an ex-Scientologist who left the church in 1979. According to Van Schaick, supposedly confidential personal information that she had divulged as part of [[Auditing (Scientology)|Scientology counselling]] was used in an attempt to blackmail her. She also reported that her home and telephone had been bugged and an attempt had been made to break up her marriage by telling her that her husband had had affairs with other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Scientologists describe illegal activities|last=Harwood|first=John|work=St Petersburg Times|date=May 9, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Shell Game===
A plan possibly called '''Operation Shell Game''' was promulgated in February 1977 by GO official Mo Budlong in an order sent to the Deputy Guardian Information Canada. It ordered Canadian GO staff to locate the papers of the former director of the World Health Organization, Dr. Brock Chisholm. A Scientologist "using a suitable guise" was to review the papers and obtain copies of anything to do with Scientology or L. Ron Hubbard. Budlong ordered that current World Federation of Mental Health members were to be checked "in any way suitable" to see whether they might have any similar papers, and "If files are discovered, obtain them."&lt;ref name="Two leaders" /&gt;

===Operation Smoke===
'''Operation Smoke''' was an infiltration campaign carried out against the [[American Cancer Society]], which had issued an alert in October 1966 warning that it had "found no evidence that treatment with the [[E-meter]] results in any objective benefits in the treatment of cancer in human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=John Alan|title=Sectarian Healers and Hypnotherapy: a study for the Committee on the Healing Arts|chapter=4|publisher=Committee on the Healing Arts|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the GO initiated Operation Smoke "to see how much ACS has been doing against Scn [Scientology] ... indications fairly active ..

===Operation Snapper===
'''Operation Snapper''' was a plot in 1976 to discredit Lawrence Tapper, the deputy attorney general in charge of the charitable trust unit in the California Attorney General's office, who had handled consumer fraud complaints against the Church of Scientology during the 1970s. The Guardian's Office intended to frame Tapper with a pregnant woman, a fake nun and a fictional bribery kickback to get him "removed from his post in the AG's office so that he can no longer commit overts [sins]" against Scientology.

The operation was divided into three "channels", each of which had several "phases". The first phase of channel one instructed:

{{quote|Recruit a very tough (woman) that is obviously pregnant and that is a good actress... she does a practice run on the AG's office to ascertain the best place in [Evelle] Younger's office [the former attorney general] to do the action. Pregnant woman simply walks into the AG's office in Sacramento and says in so many words: 'I told Larry I wouldn't do this but he gave me no choise {{sic}}. I don't care about his career anymore! I mean look at me! I'll go to the press even if it does ruin my family's reputation. I won't have an abortion!'" After creating a scene and crying, the woman was to leave, saying, "Oh, never mind, nobody will help me anyway."}}

In the second phase:

{{quote|Recruit trusted male... must be able to talk angerly {{sic}} and sound about 45 to 50 years old over the phone. "He is the father of the pregnant girl. He calls up the two areas his daughter visited and gives them hell (from an outside phone), says, 'My daughter came into your office yesterday. The pregnant girl. Well, I don't know what you people said to her but she is terrified... talks of suicide... this guy is Larry Tapper. Who is he? My daughter tells me he is the father of her child. And he's threatened to have her committed if she reveals this... You can only protect basterds {{sic}} like Tapper for so long and then you'll get a Watergate.'}}

The second channel would commence five days later, requiring the GO to "Recruit a trusted female with a lot of courage. Find out what's the biggest order of nuns in the area, and what habit they would be wearing during this season... Recruit a reliable person who can actually take professional photograph {{sic}} indoors." The "nun" would go into the Attorney General's office and ask about filing a complaint. The "photographer" would follow her and "overhear" her question, and would make her "admit" that she wanted to complain about Tapper. The "photographer" would start taking pictures of the "nun": "Nun covers her face completely. She says please don't. No! Oh God. I shouldn't have come here. Nun leaves very upset. Photographer asks receptionist who was that... and leaves." In the second phase, a Scientologist posting as a journalist would go to the office and ask questions such as "Is it true a nun came in here yesterday and accused Younger of protecting Lawrence Tapper... Any statement on this. Is Younger protecting Tapper on this? What's it all about?" The pictures taken by the "photographer" would be sent to newspapers to elicit headlines "something like 'Mysterious Nun Claims Prejudice in AG's office.' GET ARTICLE PUBLISHED. The article will cast aspersions on the charity fraud area and Tapper."

In the final channel, GO staff were instructed:

{{quote|Find out where Tapper banks... Obtain the name and address of the San Diego Mental Health's executive who just got busted for dealing in drugs. Recruit a 30-year old tough looking male... He will be taking five $20 bills ($100) and depositing them into Tapper's account. He'll ensure no prints of his are on any papers... He should wear glasses and some sort of hat so he can't be recognized again... He reports back with receipt.}}

Another Scientology agent posing as a banker was to deliver the receipt to Younger's office, implicating Tapper for receiving "payoffs from some rather strange areas." According to the planning documents for the operation, "The above channel workable {{sic}} is derived from the fact that Younger has been involved with bad PR concerning bankers and banks. This should... have Younger put a lot of attention on this caper."

At least some of Operation Snapper was put into effect. The GO documents about the operation were among the files seized by the FBI in June 1977 but it was not until February 1980 that Operation Snapper became public knowledge, when a group called the Citizens Freedom Foundation discovered the planning documents among the files that had been released in the aftermath of the convictions of the GO's leadership. When Henrietta Crampton of the CFF told Tapper about the documents that her group had uncovered, "he was quiet for a moment, and then he asked if it had anything to do with a pregnant woman. I told him it did and that I had it in writing. He said, 'You've made my weekend," and asked me to send him copies." Tapper made no further comment, as he and Attorney General Younger were being sued for allegedly illegally infiltrating the Church of Scientology.

[[Heber Jentzsch]], the Los Angeles Church of Scientology's director of public relations, argued that the plot was merely "unauthorized pranks of which we have no evidence were ever carried out." He told the ''[[Los Angeles Herald Examiner]]'' that he had "heard of the 'Snapper' operation. It was a gross operation. I can't condone that kind of activity... Someone obviously got frustrated and decided to carry out their own scenario. It should never have happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology's Bizarre Plot to Get Official|url=http://www.xenutv.com/print/laexaminer-snapper-052980.htm|work=Los Angeles Herald Examiner|date=May 29, 1980|accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=West|first=Richard|title=Attorney Probing Complaints Against Church - Scientology Plot to Smear Official|url=http://www.xenu-directory.net/news/latimes19800530.html|date=May 30, 1980|accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Snow White===

{{main|Operation Snow White}}

===Operation Sore Throat===
'''Operation Sore Throat''' was a major campaign mounted against the American Medical Association. Several Scientologist agents were infiltrated into the AMA as employees, one of whom gained access to meetings of the AMA's board of directors. In June 1975, the AMA found itself repeatedly embarrassed by leaks of confidential documents to the press by an unknown source who called himself "Sore Throat" – a punning reference to [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]] of [[Watergate scandal]] fame. The documents disclosed the AMA's political activities and liaison with the pharmaceutical industry, including lobbying for nominees to federal appointments and details of financial transactions between drug companies and the AMA's political arm.&lt;ref name="Rawitch" /&gt;

"Sore Throat" claimed to be "a doctor who worked in the A.M.A.'s Chicago office for about ten years" who had become discontent with the AMA's policies and moved to Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sore Throat Attacks|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917737-2,00.html|work=Time|date=August 18, 1975|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, he was Scientologist agent [[Michael Meisner]], who was later to be a key witness for the US Government against the Guardian's Office leadership.&lt;ref name="Kiernan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kiernan|first=Laura A.|title=Harsh Penalties Urged In Scientology Case|work=The Washington Post|date=December 4, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaks led to the AMA being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service, the [[US Postal Service]], a number of Congressional committees, [[Ralph Nader]] and the press. The AMA's internal leak investigation ultimately pointed to the Church of Scientology being behind the leaks.&lt;ref name="Shaffer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaffer|first=Ron|title=Scientologists Kept Files on 'Enemies'|work=The Washington Post|date=May 16, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; A GO memorandum of May 16, 1977 explained the circumstances of the investigation: "3 agents got placed in 2 AMA offices. It fell apart in Oct. '75 when the DC missionaire {{sic}} leaked data to the press which identified one of the agents. The AMA called in a firm of investigators who blew the Chicago agent ... and then traced a connection to the DC agents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Margasak|first=Larry|title=More internal Scientology Documents released|publisher=Associated Press|date=November 1, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two secretaries in the AMA's Washington office were discovered to be Scientologists, one working under an assumed name. [[Sherry Canavarro]], a secretary in the AMA's Chicago office, was also found to be a Scientologist and was given a [[lie detector]] test. Although she passed, confidential minutes from the AMA's board of directors were found in her desk and she was determined to have spent several unexplained weekends at work. She subsequently resigned. When the FBI investigated the case, it discovered that Canavarro also used the names "Sherry Hermann" and "Sandy Cooper" and held the post of Pacific Secretary of the Guardian Office United States.&lt;ref name="Rawitch" /&gt; Although Canavarro escaped legal charges,&lt;ref name="Rawitch" /&gt; her husband Mitchell Hermann was subsequently convicted on conspiracy charges and was imprisoned.

Operation Sore Throat was masterminded at a high level within the Guardian's Office, as the US Government's sentencing memorandum in ''United States of America v. Jane Kember, Morris Budlong'' documented. Kember, the Guardian Worldwide, sent a cover story to Deputy Guardian US Henning Heldt: "David [Gaiman] has laid down a strategy which is to enable us to contain the scene. Our plants when trapped are ''[[Freedom magazine|Freedom]]'' investigative reporters just like any other newspaper. The plants themselves do not have to confess or be named ... We can undercut AMA's continual effort to expose us by indicating it is a smokescreen to prevent ''Freedom'' from publishing."&lt;ref name="Kember-Sentencing" /&gt;

The AMA accused the Church of Scientology of being behind "Sore Throat" but Scientology spokesman denied responsibility, accusing the AMA of "grasping in the dark to cover their own crimes."&lt;ref name="Shaffer" /&gt; Even after the GO's role was exposed, Scientology spokesmen defended the leaker's actions: ""Whoever 'Sore Throat' was should get a medal," Jeffery Dubron told the ''Los Angeles Times''. "I don't know who that person was ... If this person went in and lied to get a job in the AMA and exposed crimes and created change, should that person be prosecuted for his or her actions?"&lt;ref name="Rawitch" /&gt;

In addition to the "Sore Throat" campaign, the GO carried out a series of burglaries of law firms working for the AMA. The offices of law firms Sidley &amp; Austin were burglarized by two Scientologists in 1976 who copied legally sensitive AMA files after carrying out a 90-minute search.&lt;ref name="Kiernan" /&gt;

===Operation Strike===
'''Operation Strike''' was a covert campaign which GO staffer [[Kathy Gregg]] defined in an October 1971 memo as "the action of gathering information on a covert basis." She listed a twelve-point plan of action on how to do so, ranging from acquiring squeakless shoes to establishing a "safe reading place" if stolen files could not be removed from the target location.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;

===Operation Yellow===
'''Operation Yellow''' (1976) was a plan to discredit critics of Scientology in Clearwater, Florida - and in particular the mayor, Gabriel Cazares - by making them "seem to be Fascists, commie haters, and bigots." This was to be done by sending an anonymous letter to all downtown Clearwater businesses, particularly "ALL the Jewish ones."&lt;ref name="Yellow"&gt;Stafford, Charles. "'Priority' critics of church faced special handling". St. Petersburg Times special report, January 9, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; GO national operations officer Bruce Raymond wrote a draft letter which read:

:"Fellow Clearwaterians (check spell)

:"God bless the Mayor. He is a true Christian and the entire town should be proud of him. He has stood up against un-Christian Scientology and God is obviously with him.

:"On the Scientology issues, the Mayor is right. We back him all the way. But what we should also do is make sure no more undesirables move into Clearwater.

:"We kept the Miami Jews from moving in and turning beautiful Clearwater into Miami Beach. The blacks in Clearwater are decent and know their place ..."&lt;ref name="Yellow" /&gt;

===Other operations===
====McLeans====

A series of operations was carried out by the Guardian's Office against the McLean family of [[Sutton, Ontario]], who had defected ''en masse'' from Scientology in the early 1970s. An order was issued against them in February 1973; two years later in March 1975, a US Deputy Guardian described how the GO's Branch 4 (B4) "is trying to discredit [Eric] McLean to his next-door neighbors but the only possible beneficial result of that action that would help us is if McLean is ridden out of town on a rail, and 'the public' are notoriously apathetic about doing this even when the 'proof' (sic) is exposed, much less what B4 Canada are doing." The Deputy Guardian was critical of the operation and called for it to be revised. Another document from May 1973 reported that the GO had planted an agent in the McLean household and instructed him to look for weaknesses in family relationships that could be exploited so that "this crowd ... would start to break up."&lt;ref name="Two leaders" /&gt; 

====Mark Sableman====
An operation with an unknown codename was planned against Mark Sableman, a reporter for the ''Clearwater Sun'' newspaper. On January 26, 1976 a Guardian's Office operative named Joe Lisa proposed a plan that included:

{{quote|Have a woman (elderly) go into the office and in grief and misemotion (sic) start screaming she wants to see Sableman's boss. She goes in and sees this man and screams and cries about Sableman sexually assaulting her son, or grandson. The woman takes a magazine which is lurid and perverted and throws it into the face of the man/woman and screams 'Look what he gave my son, not to mention what the pervert did ... sob, sob, to my Johnny. I'm going to the police. If you can't do something about that pervert Sableman I will see they do something to you.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology brings 4 years of discord|last=Stafford|first=Charles|date=January 9, 1980|work=St Petersburg Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Programs==
===Program Billy's Baby===
'''Program Billy's Baby''' was intended to discredit an official of the American Medical Association by having a Scientologist rehearsed in playing the role of the official's girlfriend. The aim of the operation was to cause a scandal by claiming that she had become pregnant by him. In one GO document, a GO official wrote: "I recruited a tough OT ([[operating thetan]]) female with lots of intention who could act out a few dramatic phone calls ... I drilled the FSM (field staff member) so she had the patter exactly as written and could mock up grief, drugged, slurred voice."&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;

===Program: Humanist Humiliation===
'''Program: Humanist Humiliation''' was a 1977 plan by the Guardian's Office to silence the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP, now known as the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]) and "handle terminatedly the Humanist publication Zetetic and the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal so that they never attack Scientology or Dianetics again." The 23-point order instructed GO members to spread the rumor that CSICOP was a [[CIA]] front organization set up "to discredit any and all psychic phenomena in order to keep this subject under CIA control and in order to squash paranormal research outside the CIA." The GO obtained CIA stationery on which it forged letters which were to be sent to journalists with a track record of writing on intelligence matters.&lt;ref name="Beresford"&gt;{{cite news|last=Beresford|first=David|title=Scientology's bizarre manual of dirty tricks|work=The Guardian|date=February 8, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program also included sending letters to known anti-Scientologist members of CSICOP, aiming to solicit replies that were "anti-religious and state that the committee might also look into Christian claims, etc." These replies were to be leaked to the "press, Catholic and Protestant religious leaders, and religious newspapers" as part of a strategy to "keep pushing the rumour to keep our enemies involved in a conflict with conventional religion. Get religious leaders steamed up by ringing them as concerned members of their religious communities, or as reporters, or whatever."&lt;ref name="Beresford" /&gt;

The order for Humanist Humiliation was issued by Herman Brandel, an aide to Mary Sue Hubbard, the Controller of the Guardian's Office. The plan was duly carried out; the forged CIA memo was sent to the ''[[New York Times]]'', the investigative journalist [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] and others. According to CSICOP's chairman [[Paul Kurtz]], at least one critic of the committee claimed in print that it was connected with the CIA. The Scientology offensive was carried out shortly after the CSICOP magazine ''Zetetic'' ran an article on Dianetics and Scientology by British sociologist [[Roy Wallis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marshall|first=John|title=The Scientology Papers: Cult order sought to end scientists' criticism|work=The Globe and Mail|date=January 25, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other programs===

* '''Guardian Program Order 283''', promulgated by Jane Kember, ordered the infiltration of the [[United Nations]] to provide feedback on a submission which Scientology intended to make to the UN.&lt;ref name="MSH-SentencingMemo" /&gt;

* '''Guardian Program Order 1017''', entitled "ARM Clean Sweep", called for "covert agents" for "data collection lines" (i.e. to covertly gather information) with anti-cult groups, which Scientology called the "Anti-Religious Movement" (ARM). The GO planned to set up a kidnapping to frame Michael Trauscht, a noted deprogammer. GO member Henning Heldt issued an order to set up a "covert op" which would lead to "the arrest of IFIF/IFFET [two anti-Scientology groups] principals and discrediting of ARM as a result." As a result of the operation, false documents were planted in the organisations' files purporting to show that they had conducted illegal activities. Heldt also proposed planting drugs and illegal weapons.&lt;ref name="MSH-SentencingMemo" /&gt;

* '''Guardian Program Order 1238''' ordered GO staff to "obtain the information necessary to take over the control of NIMH ([[National Institute of Mental Health]]) while at the same time establishing the lines and resources to be used in taking over NIMH." It also called for the infiltration of the US Public Health Service, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA).&lt;ref name="MSH-SentencingMemo" /&gt;

==Projects==
Projects were sub-plans of wider intelligence operations. The following provide a number of examples from the 1970s.

===Project Beetle Cleanup===
'''Project Beetle Cleanup''' called for the theft of "all DC IRS files on LRH, Scientology, etc., in the Intelligence section, OIO [Office of International Operations], and SSS [Special Services Staff]". It ordered the placement of agents in the "required areas or good access developed".&lt;ref name="Stipulation" /&gt;

===Project Horn===
'''Project Horn''' was a plan to covertly release stolen documents without revealing the thieves' identity. The records of other taxpayers would be stolen and released along with those of the Church of Scientology. A GO operative within the IRS was instructed to steal letterheaded stationery from the agency so that letters could be forged in the name of a non-existent whistleblower supposedly responsible for the leaks.&lt;ref&gt;Atack, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; The operative did so and also stole tax records for [[Bob Jones University]] and the [[Unification Church]].&lt;ref name="Stipulation"&gt;United States of America v.

===Project Normandy===

'''Project Normandy''' (December 5, 1975) was a plan devised as part of a planned takeover of the city of Clearwater, Florida in the mid-1970s. Its stated purpose was to "obtain enough data on the Clearwater area to be able to determine what groups and individuals [we] will need to penetrate and handle in order to establish area control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fsunews.com/story/life/2017/03/19/history-scientology-clearwater-florida/99381438/|title=The history of Scientology in Clearwater, Florida|last=Beehler|first=Ryan|work=FSU News|date=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's "major target" was to "fully investigate the Clearwater city and county area so we can distinguish our friends from our enemies and handle as needed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology brings 4 years of discord|last=Stafford|first=Charles|date=January 9, 1980|work=St Petersburg Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the individuals and organizations listed as targets were Clearwater's City Commission, the City Health Department, the City Mental Hygiene Department, the City Licensing Department, the City Police Department, the City Consumer Affairs Office, the City Attorney, similar offices in [[Pinellas County]] and the State of Florida, the local Representative to the US Congress, Florida's US Senators, local media companies, all local financial institutions and pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;"Final Report To The Clearwater City Commission Containing Findings, Resolutions And Recommended Ordinances To Regulate Organizations Claiming Tax-Exempt Or Non Profit Status".

===Project Owl===
'''Project Owl''' (June 1976) was a plan to infiltrate the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office in response to a planned investigation of the Church of Scientology for criminal fraud and of one of its members for kidnapping.&lt;ref name="MSH-SentencingMemo" /&gt;

===Project Quaker===
'''Project Quaker''' was a plan to hide Guardian's Office staff in Washington, D.C. from law enforcement agencies seeking to question them. The planning documents stated: "It may be deemed necessary for all the DC staff who could be pulled in for questioning to suddenly leave. US B-1 SEC is to insure that all concerned are ready to leave at any time and that all cycles - finance, 2D (relationships), bills, are completely up to P.T. (Present Time) and there no PTPs (Present Time Problems) or stops to immediate departure." A GO staffer in Clearwater, Florida was ordered to "immediately do up a confidential s-w (Staff Work) for finances for this project. This is for seven or eight people so the amount should be about $10,000.00 for staffers."&lt;ref&gt;"Final Report To The Clearwater City Commission Containing Findings, Resolutions And Recommended Ordinances To Regulate Organizations Claiming Tax-Exempt Or Non Profit Status". City of Clearwater Commission Hearings (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project Snow White===

===Project Taco-Less===
'''Project Taco-Less''' (1976) was a plan to release "further data about the Mayor" of [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]], Gabriel Cazares, to "ruin his political career and remove/restrain him as an opponent to Scn [Scientology].".&lt;ref name="MSH-SentencingMemo" /&gt;

===Project Troy===
'''Project Troy''' was aimed "to get prediction on future IRS actions" by planting a permanent bugging device in the office of the IRS Chief Counsel. Information acquired by eavesdropping would be used to brief the church's lawyers to mount defensive actions.&lt;ref name="Stipulation" /&gt;

===Project Witch===
'''Project Witch''', a sub-project of the overarching Snow White Program, targeted the UK Aliens Office, the Immigration Office, UK [[Interpol]], the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Department of Health and Social Security]]. The [[Metropolitan Police Service]] was also targeted in a bid to obtain a Scotland Yard file on Scientology and to sue the Metropolitan Police Commissioner over it.&lt;ref&gt;Beresford, David.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7887">A [[certificate of division]], a procedure for [[appeal|appellate review]] created by § 6 of the [[Judiciary Act of 1802]], authorized the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to hear questions of law certified from the [[United States circuit court]]s if the [[United States district court]] judge and the Supreme Court justice [[riding circuit]] were divided on that question. Between 1802 and 1896, certificates of division were the source of jurisdiction for approximately half of the criminal cases heard by the Supreme Court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22897">'''Litigation funding''', also known as '''[[legal financing]]''' and '''third-party funding''', enables a party to [[Lawsuit|litigate]] or [[Arbitration|arbitrate]] without having to pay for it, whether because they are unable to pay for it or because they do not want to. A third party professional funder can pay some or all of the costs/expenses associated with a dispute in return for a share of the proceeds of the dispute if it is successful. If the litigation is not successful, the funder bears the costs it has agreed to fund. 

Litigation funding has two major divisions: consumer financing, commonly referred to as pre-settlement funding or plaintiff advances, and commercial financing. Consumer financing generally consists of small advances between $500 and $2000. Prominent consumer financing companies include LawCash, Oasis Financial, and RD Legal Funding. Commercial financing for companies to pursue legal claims generally is dedicated towards payment of attorney fees and litigation costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/business/17lawsuit.html?pagewanted=all|title=Lawsuit Loans Add New Risk for the Injured|last=Appelbaum|first=Benyamin|date=2011-01-16|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent commercial financing companies include Bentham IMF, Brickell Key Asset Management, Burford Capital, Harbour Litigation Funding, Longford Capital, Statera Capital, Therium Capital, and Validity Finance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202782561037/|title=Who Rules the World of Litigation Funding? {{!}} The American Lawyer|website=The American Lawyer|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Various new websites are also promoting the use of litigation crowdfunding, in which case hundreds or tens of thousands of individuals can help to pay for a legal dispute, either investing in a case in return for part of a contingent fee, or offering donations to support a legal right that they believe in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.invest4justice.com/how-to-succeed-in-crowdfunding-your-legal-claim/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121144155/https://www.invest4justice.com/how-to-succeed-in-crowdfunding-your-legal-claim/ |archivedate=2015-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Litigation funding can be broadly split into 4 different forms in the UK, [[Contingent fee|Conditional fee agreements]], [[Costs in English law#Damages-Based Agreements|Damages Based Agreements]], [[Costs in English law#Fixed costs and fees|Fixed Fees]] and '''Third Party Funding'''.

Litigation funding is not a new concept. It has been permitted in England and Wales since 1967. Modern commercial litigation funding arose in [[Australia]] in the late 1990s, with IMF Bentham becoming the world’s first publicly listed litigation funder (ASX: IMF) in 2001. Since then, funding has spread around the globe. From Australia, where funding first gained wide acceptance after judges lifted restrictions that previously forbade it&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-11-22/big-bets-on-vw-lawsuit-could-yield-10-000-or-nothing|title=In Pursuit of a 10,000% Return|last=Chellel|first=Kit|date=Nov 22, 2016|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to the [[United Kingdom|UK]], US, [[Canada]] and [[Asia]], commercial litigation funding supports [[Lawsuit|litigants]] seeking access to justice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.raconteur.net/business/the-rise-of-global-litigation-funding|title=The rise of global litigation funding|date=2017-03-23|work=Raconteur|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Selected key judgments relating to Litigation Funding, handed down by courts around the world, are summarised below as well as key policy and regulatory developments.

==Case law==
'''2017'''

'''''Viamedia, Inc. v. Comcast Corp., et al.'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Viamedia, Inc. v. Comcast Corp|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-ilnd-1_16-cv-05486/pdf/USCOURTS-ilnd-1_16-cv-05486-2.pdf|journal=Government Publishing Office US|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Judge Amy St. Eve of the Northern District of [[Illinois]] denied defendant Comcast its motion to compel the production of certain documents that Plaintiff Viamedia provided to litigation finance firms while seeking funding to bring its case. ''Viamedia, Inc. v. Comcast Corp., et al.'', 1:16-cv-05486 (N.D. Ill. June 30, 2017). The court held the documents were protected by the work product doctrine and the protection was not waived.

Court Rejects Challenge to Litigation Funding Arrangement

'''2011'''

'''''Merchantbridge v Safron'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/jennifer_simpson_case_(2011)_re_assignment_of_claim_is_champertous.pdf][2011] EWHC 1524, full judgment&lt;/ref&gt;

Addresses liability of litigation funders to adverse costs.
 
'''2010'''

'''''Pedro Emiro Florez Arroyo and Others v BP Exploration Company (Colombia) Limited'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/arroyo___others_v_bp_exploration_co_(colombia)_ltd.pdf] QBD (Senior Master) 6/05/2010, full judgment&lt;/ref&gt;

A dispute in relation to whether the defendants should be allowed to have inspection of an agreement made between the Claimants and a third party, in this case a policy issued by an After The Event Insurer.  The High Court held that it did not have jurisdiction under the Civil Procedure Rules (the “CPR”) to compel the Claimants to produce the Agreement.  In addition to this, the Court found that the document was not relevant for the purpose of disclosure, and that, in any event, it attracted litigation privilege as it was individually negotiated between the solicitors for the Claimants and the Insurer.  The disclosure of the agreement was likely to prejudice the Claimants in the conduct of the litigation.
 
Citing the Government’s conclusions following its consultation in 2000 on “Conditional Fees: Sharing the Risks of Litigation”, the Senior Master reiterated that in privately funded litigation there is no obligation on either party to disclose how a case is being funded.  However, in spite of this, the CPR does ensure that a losing party who may be subject to additional costs as a result of a funding arrangement should have access to certain specific information about that arrangement. The Court held that these requirements of the CPR balanced the “interests of the parties with funding arrangements and the interests of those who face the claims for additional costs which result from them” and should therefore be considered sufficient without the necessity to disclose the entire agreement.

'''2008'''

'''''London &amp; Regional (St George’s Court) Ltd v Ministry of Defence'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/london___regional_v_ministry_of_defence.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[2008] EWHC 526, full judgment&lt;/ref&gt;

States that the modern authorities demonstrate a flexible approach where courts have generally declined to hold that an agreement under which a party provided assistance with litigation in return for a share of the proceeds was unenforceable.

'''2007'''

'''''Myatt v National Coal Board (No.2)'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/myatt___ors_v_national_coal_board__2007__ewca_civ_307_(16_march_2007).pdf][2007] EWCA Civ 307, full judgment&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case there had been an unsuccessful appeal to the Court of Appeal against a decision holding that a CFA entered into by a particular firm of solicitors in 4 test cases was unenforceable. This had two consequences. The first was that the claimants themselves would have to bear the cost of the ATE insurance premium from the damages recovered by them. The second was that the solicitors would be unable to recover their profit costs in those cases and in other similar cases; the total sum at stake so far as the solicitors were concerned was in the region of £200,000. The solicitors had apparently agreed to fund the appeals at their own expense, and the successful respondent sought an order that they should pay the costs of the appeal as a non-party funder. The Court of Appeal made the order sought. They held that the court had jurisdiction to do so where litigation was pursued by the client for the benefit, or to a substantial degree, for the benefit of the solicitor, because in such circumstances the solicitor was a real party to the litigation. However, because the respondents had failed to give prior notice of their intention to make such an application, which they held was normally incumbent on a party seeking such an order so as to give the solicitor the opportunity to consider whether or not to continue in the light of the risk of such an order being made, and because the appeal had been pursued in part for the client’s own interests, the fair order was that the solicitors should pay 50% of the costs.

'''2005'''

'''''Arkin v Borchard Lines Ltd &amp; Ors'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/arkin.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[2005] EWCA Civ 655, full judgment&lt;/ref&gt;

English Court of Appeal decision explicitly endorses funding as part of its judgment. Also finds that a funder is liable to the other side for costs only to the extent of its own funding.

'''2004'''

'''''Gulf Azov Shipping Co Ltd v Idisi'' '''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/gulf_azov_v_idisi.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[2004] EWCA Civ 292, full judgment&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Phillips said that public policy now recognises that it is desirable, in order to facilitate access to justice, that third parties should provide assistance designed to ensure that those who are involved in litigation have the benefit of legal representation.

'''2003'''

'''''Hamilton v Al-Fayed (No 2)'''''&lt;ref&gt;[2003] QB 1175&lt;/ref&gt;

States that a person not standing to benefit from the result of litigation, but supporting the Claimant for other reasons, may avoid an order for costs.

'''2002/2003'''

'''''R (on the application of Factortame) v Secretary of State for Transport, Environments and the Regions (No 2)'''''&lt;ref&gt;[2002] EWCA Civ 932, [2003] QB 381&lt;/ref&gt;

Court of Appeal held that funding agreement not champertous.

'''2002'''

'''''The Eurasian Dream (No 2)'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/gulf_azov_v_idisi.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[2002] 2 LIoyd's Rep 692, full judgment&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine claims assessors had carried out work for the claimants on the basis of a no-win, no-fee agreement providing for 5% of recoveries.
 
The judge rejected an argument that the agreement was champertous, saying it was necessary to consider the role played by the consultants to see whether the nature of their interest in the outcome carried with it any tendency to sully the purity of justice.
 
The opportunity for the consultants to influence the outcome was limited, as solicitors and counsel were instructed. It was relevant that it was the practice in this market to be remunerated on a similar basis.

'''''Stocznia Gdanska v Latreefers'''''&lt;ref&gt;[2001] 2 SCLC 116 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

Funders agreed to finance commercial litigation in exchange for 55% of the proceeds.
 
They agreed to pay the between-the-parties costs if the litigation failed. They also had a prior commercial interest in the litigation because they were already owed money under an agreement which successful litigation would enable them to recover.
 
The defendants sought a stay of the proceedings on the ground of champerty. Although the Court of Appeal did not have to decide whether or not the agreement was champertous, it was strongly of the view that it was not, because the alleged disproportion was more theoretical than real, the funders were undertaking a very substantial potential costs liability, they had a pre-existing interest in the subject-matter of the claim and they would not be able to influence the conduct of the litigation because that, including any negotiations, was in the hands of experienced solicitors

Considered champerty and the correct question of whether in accordance with contemporary public policy, the funding agreement has in fact caused the corruption of public justice.

Group Finance Ltd v The Fitzroy Partnership'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/guinness_peat_properties_ltd_v_fitzroy_robinson_partnership.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[1987] 1 WLR 1027, full judgment&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered whether a document prepared for a third party was privileged.  In this instance the third party was an insurance company, but the judgment bears relevance for all third parties because it sheds light on how the concept of the “dominant purpose” of a document will be interpreted in such circumstances.  In this instance, the document was a notice of a potential claim under an insurance contract, sent to the insurer, who would then send it on to their legal advisors to obtain an opinion on the merits of the potential claim.
 
The Court of Appeal decided that the document attracted litigation privilege because at the time it was created, litigation had commenced and the document was created for the dominant purpose of obtaining advice in relation to that litigation.  It was held that, when looking at the dominant purpose of a document, it was necessary for the Courts to take a wider view; the entire context of the creation of the document should be considered.  In particular, the Court of Appeal held that it was important to look at the motivation of the party requiring the document to be created (which was that it would be used by the insurer for the purpose of obtaining legal advice) and not simply the intention of those composing or preparing the document (which was in order to fulfil its obligation to notify the insurer). The document prepared for the third party was therefore held to be privileged

Although there was a champertous element in the funding agreement it contained a clause giving the Swiss courts exclusive jurisdiction and there was room for the operation of this clause notwithstanding the element of champerty.

'''2017'''

The Ministry of Justice for the United Kingdom confirmed that it would not impose statutory regulations on third party litigation funders, opting instead to allow funders to continue functioning under the current voluntary scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/moj-not-minded-to-regulate-third-party-litigation-funding/5059536.article|title=MoJ not minded to regulate third-party litigation funding|work=Law Society Gazette|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''[[Singapore]]''' passed legislation permitting funding in support of international arbitrations and related proceedings. The legislation formally abolished the torts of maintenance and champerty and declared that litigation funding contracts are enforceable in Singapore courts and tribunals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://info.dechert.com/10/8030/january-2017/singapore-to-permit-third-party-funding-of-international-arbitrations.asp|title=2017/01/19 Singapore to permit third party funding of international arbitrations {{!}} Singapore to permit third party funding of international arbitrations|website=info.dechert.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''2013'''

The '''Damages-Based Agreements Regulations''' came into force on 1 April 2013 and govern the use of Damages-Based Agreements (DBAs) in UK litigation.  DBAs are agreements between a lawyer and a client under which the lawyer’s agreed fee is contingent upon the success of the case and is determined as a percentage of the compensation received by the client.  DBAs were not permitted in the UK in contentious work, except for employment claims, until 1 April 2013.

The [[American Bar Association]] publishes its 20/20 Ethics Commission White Paper condoning litigation funding&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/ethics_2020/20111212_ethics_20_20_alf_white_paper_final_hod_informational_report.authcheckdam.pdf|title=AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION COMMISSION ON ETHICS 20/20 - INFORMATIONAL REPORT TO THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES|last=|first=|date=|website=americanbar.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''2011'''

The regulatory body responsible for litigation funding and ensuring compliance with the Code is formed, namely the Association of Litigation Funders (ALF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://associationoflitigationfunders.com/ ALF website] ALF website&lt;/ref&gt; The members of ALF have adopted the Code and undertake to comply at all times with it.

'''2011'''

A Code of Conduct for Litigation Funders was launched, which sets out the standards of best practice and behaviour for litigation funders in the UK.
 
The Code of Conduct provides transparency to claimants and their solicitors. It requires litigation funders to provide satisfactory answers to certain key questions before entering into relationships with claimants.
 
Under the Code, litigation funders are required to give assurances to claimants that, among other things, the litigation funder will not try to take control of the litigation, the litigation funder has the money to pay for the costs of the funded litigation and the litigation funder will not terminate funding absent a material adverse development.
 
The Code has been approved by Lord Justice Jackson and commended by the Chair of the Civil Justice Council, [[Lord Neuberger]] of Abbotsbury, the President of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/tpf_code_-_civil_justice_council_press_release1_final_1.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} CJC Memo&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2010'''
 
Chapter 11 of the Jackson Review of Civil Litigation Costs was published, effectively providing judicial endorsement to litigation funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/jackson_report_2010_1.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2009'''

In a keynote address [[Lord Neuberger]] of Abbotsbury, the then Master of the Rolls and now President of the Supreme Court, referred to the importance of ADR and the Lord Justice Jackson’s review of civil litigation costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/jackson_report_2010_1.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Keynote address&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2007'''

The Civil Justice Council, an Advisory Public Body established under the Civil Procedure Act 1997 with responsibility for overseeing and coordinating the modernisation of the civil justice system, published a report recommending the acceptance of litigation funding.

'''2006'''

In Campbells Cash and Carry Pty Limited v Fostif Pty Ltd (2006) 229 CLR 386 the High Court held that litigation funding was not an abuse of process or contrary to public policy. The joint judgment of the assenting judges held that in those jurisdictions which had abolished maintenance and champerty as crimes and/or torts (i.e. Australian Capital Territory, [[New South Wales]], [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]), the concept of public policy or abuse of process could not be used to found a challenge to proceedings being maintained. As a result of this decision, it was clear that, absent special circumstances, litigation funding arrangements would no longer be declared void as contrary to public policy&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.jdsupra.com/13ad0654-4faf-41f4-839b-eddf35ff4efd.pdf|title=Litigation Funding in Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=documents.jdsupra.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''1995'''

Australia provides a legislative exception allowing insolvency practitioners to use funding. Commercial litigation funding companies emerged to service the new market, eventually funding plaintiffs’ suits outside of the insolvency process&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

'''1787'''

Legal reformer Jeremy Bentham declares that restrictions against litigation funding are a “barbarous precaution” born out of a “barbarous age”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/jeremy_bentham_on_champerty_and_maintenance.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Bentham J on Champerty &amp; Maintenance&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre''' (MAOC) (or '''Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre - Narcotics'''), based in [[Lisbon]], is an international agency set up to coordinate anti-[[drug trafficking]] action by several [[European Union]] states with financial support from the Prevention against Crime Programme of the European Union, European Commission – Directorate -General Home Affairs. The participating states are Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, the Netherlands and Italy. The centre has been active since 1 April 2006. The Agreement that established MAOC (N) states that the Centre is to provide a forum for multi-lateral cooperation to suppress illicit drug trafficking by sea and air. The Centre aims to use intelligence on drug smuggling operations, by air or sea, to apply the most suitable military and/or law enforcement teams to respond to situations that arise. Its area of operations is the eastern [[Atlantic]], from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in Southern Africa to the [[Norwegian Sea]].The Lisbon headquarters is staffed by Country Liaison Officers (CLOs) representing the police, customs, military and maritime authorities of the participating European nations, as well as by permanent observer from the United States through the [[Joint Interagency Task Force]] South (JIATFS). The European Commission, Europol, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] (EMCDDA) are observers of the MAOC (N), as well as Canada, Cape Verde, Germany, Greece, and Morocco. MAOC (N) is headed by an Executive Director and guided by an Executive Board.&lt;ref name=HMG&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Maritime centre launched to tackle drug shipments to Europe| work =| publisher =[[Home Office]]| date =30 September 2007| url =http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/maritime-centre-launch?version=2| format =| doi =| accessdate =2 June 2009}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom has allocated a team of three from its [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]] (SOCA); a SOCA officer serves as the Centre's first Director until October 2009. For the British, this was expected to build on the existing strong relationship between SOCA and the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name=HMG /&gt;  Ireland's representation is a combined one from the Irish [[Drugs Joint Task Force]] of the [[Garda Síochána]] (Irish police), the [[Irish Customs Service]] and the [[Irish Naval Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Operations==
About twenty operations were executed in MAOC's first six months, resulting in 10 seizures totalling more than 10 tonnes of cocaine.&lt;ref name=HMG /&gt;  

In an operation in June, 2007, 840 [[kilograms]] of cocaine were seized aboard a Brazilian flagged vessel which was intercepted by the [[French Navy]], acting on UK intelligence. The vessel, drugs and prisoners were returned to Brazil for prosecution.&lt;ref name=HMG /&gt; 

On 3 September 2010 British police acting on intelligence from the [[Office Central pour la Répression du Trafic Illicite des Stupéfiants|French Central Office against Illegal Narcotics Trafficking]] (OCRTIS) and supported by the Royal Navy’s HMS Gloucester recovered around 30 kilos of cocaine which had been concealed inside the rudder of the yacht ‘Tortuga’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soca.gov.uk/news/270-soca-welcomes-milestone-in-west-africas-fight-against-drugs&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Metropolitan Police Act 1829''' (10 Geo.4, c.44) was an [[Act of Parliament]] introduced by [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]]. The Act established the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] of London (with the exception of [[City of London|the City]]), replacing the previously disorganized system of [[Constable#United Kingdom|parish constables]] and [[Watchman (law enforcement)|watchmen]]. The Act was the enabling legislation for what is often considered to be the first modern police force, the "bobbies" or "peelers" (after Peel), which served as the model for modern urban police departments throughout England. Until the 1829 Act, the [[Statute of Winchester]] of 1285 was cited as the primary legislation regulating the policing of the country since the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= A History of Police in England and Wales | first= Thomas Alan | last= Critchley | year= 1978 | quote= The Statute of Winchester was the only general public measure of any consequence enacted to regulate the policing of the country between the Norman Conquest and the Metropolitan Police Act, 1829…}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the [[Metropolitan Police Act|Metropolitan Police Acts 1829 to 1895]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Short Titles Act 1896]], section 2(1) and Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Section 1 of the Act established a [[Police Station|Police Office]] for the Metropolis, to be under two [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|commissioners]] who were to be [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]].

Section 4, constituted the [[Metropolitan Police District]] (MPD) from the [[Liberty of Westminster]] and parts of the counties of [[Middlesex]], [[Surrey]] and [[Kent]], and stated that "a sufficient number of fit and able men shall from time to time, by the direction of [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|His Majesty's Secretaries of State]], be appointed as a Police Force for the whole of such district ..." The constables were to have power not only within the MPD, but also throughout Middlesex, Surrey, [[Hertfordshire]], [[Essex]] and Kent.

Section 6 made it an offence for the owner of a public house to harbour a police officer during his hours of duty.

Section 7 outlined the powers of the new police force. A constable was empowered to apprehend "all loose, idle and disorderly Persons whom he shall find disturbing the public Peace, or whom he shall have just Cause to suspect of any evil Designs, and all Persons whom he shall find between sunset and the Hour of Eight in the Forenoon lying in any Highway, Yard, or other Place, or loitering therein, and not giving a satisfactory Account of themselves ..."

Section 8 made it an offence to assault or resist a police officer, with the penalty of a fine not exceeding five pounds.

Other sections dealt with arrangements for the handing over of police powers in the various parishes, with existing "watchmen and night police" to continue until the commissioners indicated that the Metropolitan Police were ready to assume responsibility for the area. Overseers in the parishes were to levy a Police Rate on all persons liable to pay the [[English Poor Laws|Poor Rate]], not to exceed eight pence in the pound.

Section 34 of the Act allowed other parishes to be added to the Metropolitan Police District by [[Order in Council]]. Any place in Middlesex, Surrey, Hertfordshire, Essex or Kent within twelve miles of [[Charing Cross]] could be added.

The '''Minnesota Starvation Experiment''', also known as the '''Minnesota Semi-Starvation Experiment''', the '''Minnesota Starvation-Recovery Experiment''' and the '''Starvation Study''', was a clinical study performed at the [[University of Minnesota]] between November 19, 1944 and December 20, 1945. The investigation was designed to determine the physiological and psychological effects of severe and prolonged dietary restriction and the effectiveness of dietary rehabilitation strategies.

The motivation of the study was twofold: first, to produce a definitive treatise on the subject of human [[starvation]] based on a laboratory simulation of severe [[famine]] and, second, to use the scientific results produced to guide the Allied relief assistance to famine victims in Europe and Asia at the end of [[World War II]]. It was recognized early in 1944 that millions of people were in grave danger of mass famine as a result of the conflict, and information was needed regarding the effects of semi-starvation—and the impact of various rehabilitation strategies—if postwar relief efforts were to be effective.

The study was developed in coordination with the [[Civilian Public Service]] (CPS) and the [[Selective Service System]] and used 36 men selected from a pool of over 200 CPS volunteers.&lt;ref name=The_Great_Starvation_Experiment&gt;{{Cite book

The study was divided into three phases: A twelve-week control phase, where physiological and psychological observations were collected to establish a baseline for each subject; a 24-week starvation phase, during which the caloric intake of each subject was drastically reduced—causing each participant to lose an average of 25% of their pre-starvation body weight; and finally a recovery phase, in which various rehabilitative diets were tried to re-nourish the volunteers. Two subjects were dismissed for failing to maintain the dietary restrictions imposed during the starvation phase of the experiment, and the data for two others were not used in the analysis of the results.

In 1950, [[Ancel Keys]] and his colleagues published the results of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment in a two-volume, 1,385 page text entitled ''The Biology of Human Starvation'' ([[University of Minnesota Press]]).&lt;ref name=Biology_of_Human_Starvation&gt;{{Cite book

== Principal investigators ==
[[Ancel Keys]] was the lead investigator of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment.  He was responsible for the general supervision of the activities in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene and was directly responsible for the X-ray analysis and administrative work for the project.  Keys founded the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene at the University of Minnesota in 1940 after leaving positions at Harvard's Fatigue Laboratory and the Mayo Clinic.  Starting in 1941, he served as a special assistant to the U.S. Secretary of War and worked with the Army to develop rations for troops in combat ([[K-rations]]).&lt;ref name=The_Great_Starvation_Experiment/&gt;{{rp|30–31}} Keys served as Director for the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene for 26 years, and retired in 1972 after a distinguished 36-year career at the University of Minnesota.

Olaf Mickelsen was responsible for the chemical analyses conducted in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene during the Starvation Study, and the daily dietary regime of the CPS subjects—including the supervision of the kitchen and its staff.  During the study, he was an associate professor of biochemistry and physiological hygiene at the University of Minnesota and received his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin in 1939.

Henry Longstreet Taylor had the major responsibility of recruiting the 36 CPS volunteers used in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment, maintaining the morale of the participants and their involvement in the study.  During the study he collaborated with Austin Henschel in conducting the physical performance, respiration and postural tests.  He received his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1941 and joined the faculty at the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene, where he held a joint appointment with the Department of Physiology.  His research concentrated on problems in cardiovascular physiology, temperature regulation, metabolism and nutrition, aging and cardiovascular epidemiology.

Austin Henschel shared the responsibility of screening the CPS volunteers with Taylor for selection in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment and, in addition, had charge of the blood morphology and scheduling all the tests and measurements of the subjects during the course of the study.  He was a member of the faculty in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene and the Department of Medicine at the University of Minnesota.

Josef Brožek (1914–2004)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.lehigh.edu/News/news_story.asp?iNewsID=770 In remembrance: Josef Brozek, research professor of psychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403044635/http://www3.lehigh.edu/News/news_story.asp?iNewsID=770 |date=2012-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was responsible for psychological studies during the Starvation Study, including the psychomotor tests, anthropometric measurements and statistical analysis of the results.  Brožek received his PhD from Charles University in Prague, [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1937.  He emigrated to the United States in 1939 and joined the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene at the University of Minnesota in 1941, where he served in a succession of posts over a 17-year period. His research in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene concerned malnutrition and behavior, visual illumination and performance, and aging.

== Participant volunteers ==

An essential ingredient for the successful execution of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment was the availability of a sufficient number of healthy volunteers willing to subject themselves to the year-long invasion of privacy, nutritional deprivation and physical and mental hardship necessary to complete the study.  From the outset, the experiment was planned in cooperation with the Civilian Public Service and the Selective Service System, with the intention of using volunteers selected from the ranks of [[conscientious objector]]s already inducted into public wartime service. Keys obtained approval from the War Department to select participants from the CPS.

In early 1944, a recruitment brochure was drafted and distributed within the network of CPS work camps throughout the United States.  Over 400 men volunteered to participate in the study as an alternative to military service; of these, about 100 were selected for detailed examination.  Drs. Taylor, Brožek, and Henschel from the Minnesota Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene traveled to the various CPS units to interview the potential candidates and administer physical and psychological tests to the volunteers.  36 men were ultimately selected who demonstrated evidence of the required mental and physical health, the ability to get along reasonably well within a group while enduring deprivation and hardship, and sufficient commitment to the relief and rehabilitation objectives of the investigation to complete the study.  The subjects were all white males, with ages ranging from 22 to 33 years old.

Of the 36 volunteer subjects, 15 were members of the [[Peace churches|Historic Peace Churches]] ([[Mennonite]]s, [[Church of the Brethren]] and [[Quaker]]s). Others were there, including [[Methodism|Methodist]]s, [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]s, [[Baptist]]s, and one each [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]]ian, Evangelical &amp; Reformed, [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]], [[Congregational church|Congregational]], and Evangelical Mission Covenant, along with two participants without a declared religion.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker 2006, pp. ix, x, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 36 CPS participants in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment were: William Anderson, Harold Blickenstaff, Wendell Burrous, Edward Cowles, George Ebeling, Carlyle Frederick, Jasper Garner, Lester Glick, James Graham, Earl Heckman, Roscoe Hinkle, [[Max Kampelman]], Sam Legg, Phillip Liljengren, Howard Lutz, Robert McCullagh, William McReynolds, Dan Miller, L. Wesley Miller, Richard Mundy, Daniel Peacock, James Plaugher, Woodrow Rainwater, Donald Sanders, [[Henry Scholberg|Cedric (Henry) Scholberg]], Charles Smith, William Stanton, Raymond Summers, Marshall Sutton, Kenneth Tuttle, Robert Villwock, William Wallace, Franklin Watkins, W. Earl Weygandt, Robert Wiloughby and Gerald Wilsnack.

== Goals and methods ==

The primary objective of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment was to study in detail the physical and psychological effects of prolonged, famine-like semi-starvation on healthy men, as well as their subsequent rehabilitation from this condition.  To achieve these goals, the 12-month study was divided into four distinct phases:

# '''Control Period''' (12 weeks): This was a standardization period when the subjects received a controlled diet of approximately 3,200 kilocalories of food each day. The diet of the subjects who were close to their "ideal" weight was adjusted so as to maintain caloric balance, while the diets of the underweight and overweight individuals was adjusted so as to bring them close to their ideal weight.  On average, the group ended up slightly below their "ideal" weight.&lt;ref name=Biology_of_Human_Starvation/&gt;{{rp|74}} In addition, the clinical staff of the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene routinely conducted a series of anthropometric, physiological and psychological tests designed to [[Characterization (materials science)|characterize]] the physical and mental health of each participant under normal conditions.
# '''Semi-Starvation Period''' (24 weeks):  During the 6-month semi-starvation period, each subject's dietary intake was cut to approximately 1,560 kilocalories per day.  Their meals were composed of foods that were expected to typify the diets of people in Europe during the latter stages of the war: [[potato]]es, [[rutabaga]]s, [[turnip]]s, [[bread]] and [[macaroni]]. 
# '''Restricted Rehabilitation Period''' (12 weeks):  The participants were divided into four groups of eight men; each group received a strictly-controlled rehabilitation diet, consisting of one of four different caloric energy levels.  In each energy-level group, the men were further subdivided into subgroups receiving differing protein and vitamin supplements regimes. In this manner, the clinical staff examined various energy, protein and vitamin strategies for re-nourishing the subjects from the conditions of famine induced during the semi-starvation period.
# '''Unrestricted Rehabilitation Period''' (8 weeks):  For the final rehabilitation period, caloric intake and food content was unrestricted but carefully recorded and monitored.

During the starvation period, the subjects received two meals per day designed to induce the same level of nutritional stress for each participant.  Since each subject had distinct metabolic characteristics, the diet of each man was adjusted throughout the starvation period to produce roughly a 25% total weight loss over the 24-week period.

The researchers tracked each subject's weight as a function of time elapsed since the beginning of the starvation period. For each subject, the weight versus time plot was expected—as well as enforced—to form a particular curve, the ''prediction weight-loss curve'', whose characteristics were decided before the commencement of the experiment. The postulated curves turned out to be quite predictive for most subjects. If a subject did veer off his curve in any given week, his caloric intake for the next week would be adjusted, by varying the amount of bread and potatoes, to bring him back to the curve; however, the required adjustments were usually minor.&lt;ref name=Biology_of_Human_Starvation/&gt;{{rp|75}} The shapes of the curves were chosen "based on the concept that the rate of weight loss would progressively decrease and reach a relative plateau" at the final weight.&lt;ref name=Biology_of_Human_Starvation/&gt;{{rp|74}}

For each subject, the weight vs. time curve was taken to be quadratic in time (in fact, an upward-opening [[parabola]]) with the [[Maxima and minima|minimum]] located at 24 weeks, at which point the weight is supposed to be equal to the final target body weight (the minimum is where the curve has zero [[slope]]; this corresponds to the "plateau" mentioned above). Mathematically, this means that the curve for each subject was given by

:: &lt;math&gt;W(t)=W_{f}+K\, (24-t)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time (measured in weeks) elapsed since the beginning of the starvation period, &lt;math&gt;W(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the subject's weight at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;W_{f}&lt;/math&gt; is the final weight that the subject was supposed to reach at the end of the 24-week period. The constant &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the requirement that &lt;math&gt;W(t=0)&lt;/math&gt; be the initial weight &lt;math&gt;W_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. by solving

:: &lt;math&gt;W_{i}=W_{f}+K\, (24-0)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;; this gives

:: &lt;math&gt;K=\frac{W_{i}-W_{f}}{24^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The authors expressed this in terms of the percent total weight loss &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;,

:: &lt;math&gt;P=100 \times \frac{W_{i}-W_{f}}{W_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;

(which, as stated above, was supposed to be about 25% for all subjects), obtaining

:: &lt;math&gt;K=\frac{P}{100 \times 24^{2}}\,W_{i}&lt;/math&gt;.

Throughout the duration of the study each man was assigned specific work tasks, was expected to walk {{convert|22|mi}} each week and required to keep a personal diary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/itvs/thegoodwar/diary.html] Excerpts from Lester Glick's diary. Retrieved February 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  An extensive battery of tests was periodically administered, including the collection of metabolic and physical measurements; X-ray examinations; treadmill performance; and intelligence and [[psychological evaluation]].

== Results ==

The full report of results from the Minnesota Starvation Experiment was published in 1950 in a two-volume, 1,385-page text entitled ''The Biology of Human Starvation'' (University of Minnesota Press).  The 50-chapter work contains an extensive analysis of the physiological and psychological data collected during the study, and a comprehensive literature review.

Among the conclusions from the study was the confirmation that prolonged semi-starvation produces significant increases in depression, [[hysteria]] and [[hypochondriasis]] as measured using the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]].  Indeed, most of the subjects experienced periods of severe emotional distress and depression.&lt;ref name=The_Great_Starvation_Experiment/&gt;{{rp|161}} There were extreme reactions to the psychological effects during the experiment including self-mutilation (one subject amputated three fingers of his hand with an axe, though the subject was unsure if he had done so intentionally or accidentally).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/wwii/a1.html|title=Battles of Belief|publisher=[[American RadioWorks]]|accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants exhibited a preoccupation with food, both during the starvation period and the rehabilitation phase.  Sexual interest was drastically reduced, and the volunteers showed signs of social withdrawal and isolation.&lt;ref name=The_Great_Starvation_Experiment/&gt;{{rp|123–124}} The participants reported a decline in concentration, comprehension and judgment capabilities, although the standardized tests administered showed no actual signs of diminished capacity. This ought not, however, to be taken as an indication that capacity to work, study and learn will not be affected by starvation or intensive dieting. There were marked declines in physiological processes indicative of decreases in each subject's [[basal metabolic rate]] (the energy required by the body in a state of rest), reflected in reduced body temperature, respiration and heart rate.  Some of the subjects exhibited [[edema]] in their extremities, presumably due to decreased levels of plasma proteins given that the body's ability to construct key proteins like albumin is based on available energy sources.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Related work ==

One of the crucial observations of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment discussed by a number of researchers in the nutritional sciences—including Ancel Keys—is that the physical effects of the induced semi-starvation during the study closely approximate the conditions experienced by people with a range of [[eating disorders]] such as [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia nervosa]]. As a result of the study it has been postulated that many of the profound social and psychological effects of these disorders may result from undernutrition, and recovery depends on physical re-nourishment as well as psychological treatment.&lt;ref name=The_Great_Starvation_Experiment/&gt;{{rp|199–200}}

'''Mobay Chemical Corporation''', based in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], was a [[joint venture]] of [[Monsanto Company]] and [[Bayer]] to market [[polyurethanes]] in the [[United States]]. Founded in 1954, Bayer bought out Monsanto's shares in the company in the 1970s.

Mobay, along with [[Miles Laboratories]], was a member of Bayer's [[menagerie]] of companies in the US while Bayer did not own the US rights to its name.

After a first failed attempt of appearing under the ''Bayer USA Inc.'' name in the US, Bayer consolidated its US operations under the ''Miles'' name in 1992.

The '''National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund''' provides [[deposit insurance]] to protect the accounts of [[credit union]] members at federally insured institutions in the United States. Created in 1970, the Share Insurance Fund is administered by the [[National Credit Union Administration]], an independent federal financial regulator. The Share Insurance Fund is funded completely by participating credit unions, and not one penny of insured savings has ever been lost by a member of a federally insured credit union.  The Share Insurance Fund is backed by the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause|full faith and credit]] of the United States government.

As of December 2016, Share Insurance Fund insured an estimated $1 trillion in member shares in more than 5,800 federally insured credit unions.&lt;ref name="ncua2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncua.gov/Resources/Reports/annualrpt/2007AR.pdf|title=National Credit Union Administration Annual Report 2007|publisher=National Credit Union Administration|location=Alexandria, VA|date=|accessdate=2009-08-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829205809/http://ncua.gov/Resources/Reports/annualrpt/2007AR.pdf|archivedate=2009-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding, premiums and dividends ==
[[Image:ncua-insured.jpg|thumb|right|This sign, displayed at all insured credit unions, informs members that their savings are insured by the NCUA]]
In 1970, Congress approved, and President [[Richard M. Nixon]] signed, Public Law 91-206 (see [[Title 12 of the United States Code|12 U.S.C.]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/1781 §§] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/1781 1781]–[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/1790(c)][https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/1790(c) 1790](c)), creating the National Credit Union Administration as an independent federal financial regulator. Soon after, Congress established the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and made NCUA responsible for its administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Insurance for Credit Unions|last=Cole|first=Robert|date=1970-11-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Share Insurance Fund is approximately $13 billion in total, made up of $2.8 billion in retained earnings and approximately $10 billion in contributed capital from credit unions. Contributed capital is the one percent of insured shares deposited by each federal credit union, as well as all federally insured, state-chartered credit unions.  The Federal Credit Union Act requires the NCUA Board to set a target equity ratio of at least 1.20 percent and no more than 1.50 percent of total insured deposits.  It is NCUA Board policy that the normal operating equity ratio is 1.30 percent.

The majority of the fund is invested in United States [[United States Treasury security|treasury securities]], with a portion of the earnings being used to fund NCUA’s operations. NCUA gets about $200 million of its current budget from the Share Insurance Fund, with the remainder coming from operating fees charged to regulated credit unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncua.gov/Resources/Reports/annualrpt/2007AR.pdf|title=National Credit Union Administration Annual Report 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Credit Union Administration|location=Alexandria, VA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829205809/http://ncua.gov/Resources/Reports/annualrpt/2007AR.pdf|archive-date=2009-08-29|dead-url=yes|access-date=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event that the equity ratio of the fund falls below 1.20 percent, the Federal Credit Union Act requires the NCUA Board to charge credit unions a premium or to develop and implement a restoration plan for the fund. The NCUA Board has discretion whether to charge a premium when the equity ratio is between 1.20 percent and 1.30 percent.

NCUA has assessed a Share Insurance Fund premium three times since the Fund was recapitalized in 1984: 1991, 2009 and 2010.

== NCUSIF insured accounts ==
The Share Insurance Fund protects members’ accounts in federally insured credit unions in the event of a credit union failure. The fund insures the balance of each members’ account, dollar-for dollar, up to the standard maximum share insurance amount of $250,000. NCUA insurance covers all types of member shares received by a credit union including:

* [[Transaction account|Share draft accounts]] (aka "checking accounts").
* [[Savings account|Share savings]] that can be added to or withdrawn from at any time.
* "Money market share" accounts, essentially high-interest share savings accounts (the name is similar to "money market funds" which are     not insured).
* [[Certificate of deposit|Share certificates]] (CDs), which generally require funds be kept in the account for a set period.
* Outstanding Cashier's Checks, Interest Checks, and other [[negotiable instrument]]s drawn on the accounts of the credit union.

NCUA publishes a variety of helpful resources for consumers to better understand insurance coverage on their deposits at federally insured credit unions, including:

* The [https://www.mycreditunion.gov/estimator/Pages/default.aspx Share Insurance Estimator], NCUA’s interactive site which allows users to input data to compute the amount of Share Insurance Fund coverage available under different account scenarios, and 
* NCUA’s share insurance publications [https://www.ncua.gov/Legal/GuidesEtc/GuidesManuals/NCUAHowYourAcctInsured.pdf How Your Accounts Are Federally Insured] and [https://www.ncua.gov/legal/guidesetc/guidesmanuals/ncuayourinsuredfunds.pdf Your Insured Funds]. Both publications are available in English and Spanish.
* A [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKMWQm_YvfQ&amp;index=2&amp;list=PL--na5_QagEh3V0FQTi1T71jZThMixuEG three-part] YouTube series designed to educate depositors about the protection offered by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. 
The Share Insurance Fund also provides funding when a credit union is no longer able to continue operating, the credit union will be liquidated and the NCUSIF will pay member shares up to $250,000.

Since the passage of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act|Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005]] deposits were insured for up to $100,000 per insured account, or $250,000 for certain retirement accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= |first= |date= |year=May 2006 |title=NCUA Increases Retirement Insurance Coverage PDF |url=http://www.ncua.gov/ShareInsurance/SpecialBulletin.pdf |journal= |publisher=National Credit Union Administration |volume= |pages= |archive-date=2008-03-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307175903/http://www.ncua.gov/ShareInsurance/SpecialBulletin.pdf |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6079">There are many [[stereotype]]s surrounding individual [[nation]]s. X's stereotype for Y may be different from Z's. The stereotypes may have kernels of truth to them, but they are not wholly correct, and so are heavily misleading. In some cases, negative stereotypes have been spread by one country in order to discredit another. Sometimes countries may promote national stereotypes about themselves in order to instill a sense of [[patriotism]], for examples in wars when an us-vs.-them mentality is often favoured.

An NBC.com article on the validity of national stereotypes suggests that "the stereotypes we all know and love, like the "French lover" and "the icy Brit," were mostly created by [[literature]]". It explained that "partly because of such "dirty books," and partly due to French PR, France got the reputation of being sexually free", and offered evidence to the contrary with a recent survey that showed "76 percent of the French sometimes suffer from lack of sexual response".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40955746/ns/health-sexual_health/t/latin-lovers-frigid-brits-how-sexy-stereotypes-measure/#.UltkdlNFqfZ |title=Latin lovers? Frigid Brits? Mythbusting sexy stereotypes - Health - Sexual health - Sexploration |publisher=NBC News |date=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
According to an article by ''[[The Guardian]]'' entitled ''European stereotypes: what do we think of each other and are we right? - interactive'', the Europe stereotype towards Britain is as "drunken, semi-clad hooligans or else snobbish, stiff free marketers", their view towards France is "cowardly, arrogant, chauvinistic, erotomaniacs", and they see Germany as "uber-efficient, diligent [and] disciplined". To Europe, Italy is "tax-dodging, Berlusconi-style and mama's boys, incapable of bravery", Poland is "heavy-drinking [[Catholicism|ultracatholics]] with a whiff of [[antisemitism]]", and Spain is "macho men and fiery woman prone to regular siestas and fiestas". While some countries such as Germany proudly own their stereotype, others like Spain argue that theirs is a warped view based on experiences while on holiday instead of having actually lived there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/jan/26/european-stereotypes-europa |title=European stereotypes: what do we think of each other and are we right? - interactive &amp;#124; World news |language=nb |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2012-01-26 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Pew Research Center|Pew Global]] survey of the European countries [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Poland]], and the [[Czech Republic]] found that European stereotypes found Germany to be both the most hardworking and least corrupt, Greece to be the least hardworking, and Italy to be the most corrupt. It is also worth noting that 5 out of the 8 countries thought their own country was the most corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Graphic detail Charts, maps and infographics |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/05/greeks-say-they-are-hardest-working-european-nation |title=Greeks say they are the hardest-working European nation: Stereotypes of Europe |publisher=The Economist |date=2012-05-30 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pictural representations==
[[Yanko Tsvetkov]] has designed many maps which serve as pictorial representations of such stereotypes, giving an impression of how certain regions of the world may view others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/mapping-stereotypes-europe-us-2011-9?op=1#europe-according-to-france-1 |title=MAPS: A Complete Guide To National Stereotypes All Around The World &amp;#124; Business Insider Australia |publisher=Businessinsider.com.au |date=2011-09-03 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/feb/17/stereotype-maps-yanko-tsvetkov |title=Yanko Tsvetkov's stereotype maps - in pictures &amp;#124; Art and design |publisher=The Guardian |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alphadesigner.com/mapping-stereotypes/ |title=Mapping Stereotypes |publisher=Alphadesigner |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have named such as "The Arab Winter" and "Crystal Ball View Of Europe In 2022".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Dowling |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/17/stereotype-maps-tsvetkov |title=Stereotype maps: Is that what they think of us? &amp;#124; Art and design |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1909/1910 '''People's Budget''' was a proposal of the [[Liberal government, 1905&amp;ndash;1915|Liberal government]] that introduced unprecedented taxes on the lands and high incomes of Britain's wealthy to fund new [[Liberal welfare reforms|social welfare programmes]]. It passed the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 1909 but was blocked by the [[House of Lords]] for a year and became law in April 1910.

It was championed by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[David Lloyd George]], and his young ally [[Winston Churchill]], who was then [[President of the Board of Trade]] and a fellow Liberal; called the "Terrible Twins" by certain [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Lee, ''The People's Budget: An Edwardian Tragedy''&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill's biographer, [[William Manchester]], called the People's Budget "a revolutionary concept" because it was the first budget in British history with the expressed intent of redistributing wealth equally amongst the British population.&lt;ref&gt;William Manchester, ''The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill, Visions of Glory 1874–1932'' (1983), pp. 408–409.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a key issue of contention between the Liberal government and the Conservative-dominated House of Lords, leading to two [[United Kingdom general elections|general election]]s in 1910 and the enactment of the [[Parliament Act 1911]].

== Overview ==
The Budget was introduced in the British Parliament by [[David Lloyd George]] on 29 April 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mr. Lloyd George |last=Raymond |first=E. T. |authorlink= |year=1922 |publisher=George H. Doran company |location= |isbn= |page=118 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=kmdsTJHmJoWUjAfj1cjjAQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=i2nSAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=people%27s+budget+introduced&amp;q=april+29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd George argued that the People's Budget would eliminate poverty, and commended it thus:

{{blockquote|This is a war Budget. It is for raising money to wage implacable warfare against poverty and squalidness. I cannot help hoping and believing that before this generation has passed away, we shall have advanced a great step towards that good time, when poverty, and the wretchedness and human degradation which always follows in its camp, will be as remote to the people of this country as the wolves which once infested its forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/britain1906to1918/g2/gallery2.htm |title=The National Archives Learning Curve. Britain 1906–1918. Achievements of Liberal Welfare Reforms: Gallery 2 |publisher=Learningcurve.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907082934/http://learningcurve.gov.uk/britain1906to1918/g2/gallery2.htm |archivedate=2008-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The budget included several proposed tax increases to fund the [[Liberal welfare reforms]]. [[Income tax]] was held at nine [[penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pence]] in the [[pound sterling|pound]] (9d, or 3.75%) on incomes less than £2,000, which was equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2000|1909|r=-4}}}} in today's money{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}—but a higher rate of one [[shilling]] (12d, or 5%) was proposed on incomes greater than £2,000, and an additional surcharge or [[supertax]] of 6d (a further 2.5%) was proposed on the amount by which incomes of £5,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|5000|1909|r=-4}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) or more exceeded £3,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|3000|1909|r=-4}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}). An increase was also proposed in [[inheritance tax|death duties]] and naval rearmament.

More controversially, the Budget also included a proposal for the introduction of complete land valuation and a 20% tax on increases in value when land changed hands.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus 1964, p. 527&lt;/ref&gt; [[Land tax]]es were based on the ideas of the American tax reformer [[Henry George]]. This would have had a major effect on large landowners, and the [[Conservative Party (UK)#Conservatives and Unionists (1867–1914)|Conservative-Unionist]] opposition, many of whom were large landowners, had had an overwhelming majority in the Lords since the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal split in 1886]]. Furthermore, the Conservatives believed that money should be raised through the introduction of [[tariff]]s on [[imports]], which would benefit British industry and trade within the Empire, and raise revenue for social reforms at the same time ([[protectionism]]); but this was also unpopular as it would have meant higher prices on imported food. According to economic theory, such tariffs would have been very beneficial for landowners, especially tariffs on agricultural produce, but the costs to ordinary consumers would have exceeded the gains to these landowners (see [[Corn Laws]]).

=== Constitutional stand-off ===
The [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Northcliffe Press]] (who published both ''[[The Times]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'') urged rejection of the budget to give tariff reform a chance.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus 1964, p. 532&lt;/ref&gt; There were many public meetings, some of them organised by dukes, which portrayed the budget as the thin end of the socialist wedge. Lloyd George gave a speech at [[Limehouse]] (July 1909) in which he said that "a {{sic|?|hide=y|fully|-}}equipped duke costs as much to keep up as two [[dreadnought]]s"—but was "much less easy to scrap".&lt;ref&gt;Magnus 1964, p. 527&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservatives wanted to force an election by rejecting the budget.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus 1964, p. 534&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lords were entitled by convention to reject, but not to amend, a money bill, but had not rejected a budget for two centuries. Originally the budget had included only annual renewals of existing taxes—any amendment to taxes was part of a separate Act. This ended in 1861 ([[William Ewart Gladstone]] was Chancellor at the time) when the Lords rejected the repeal of paper duties—which would have benefited new cheaper newspapers, aimed at men who hoped soon to be given the right to vote, at the expense of existing papers. From then on, all taxes were included in the Finance Bill, and no such bill had been rejected, not even the controversial introduction of death duties by [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Sir William Harcourt]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;
Magnus 1964, p. 530&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|the King]]'s private urgings that the budget be passed to avoid a crisis,&lt;ref&gt;Magnus 1964, p. 536&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords vetoed the new budget on 30 November 1909, although they were clear that they would pass it as soon as the Liberals obtained an electoral mandate for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Alan|author2=Veronica|year=1992|title=The Chronology of British History|publisher=Century Ltd|location=London|pages=342–343|isbn=0-7126-5616-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberals countered by proposing to reduce the power of the Lords. This was the main issue of the general election in [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|January 1910]], setting the stage for a tremendous showdown, which Lloyd George and Churchill relished.

Despite the heated rhetoric, opinion in the country was divided.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus 1964, p. 546&lt;/ref&gt; The Unionists with 47% of the votes were outpolled by the Liberals and their allies from the Labour Party. The outcome was a [[hung parliament]], with the Liberals relying on Labour and the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] for their parliamentary majority.

As the price for their continued support, the Irish nationalist MPs demanded measures to remove the Lords' veto so that they could no longer block Irish Home Rule. They even threatened to vote down the Budget in the House of Commons (Irish Nationalists favoured tariff reform and abhorred the planned increase in whisky duty&lt;ref&gt;Magnus 1964, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt;) until Asquith pledged to introduce such measures.

As they had promised, the Lords accepted the Budget on 28 April 1910—a year to the day after its introduction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mr. Lloyd George |last=Raymond |first=E. T. |authorlink= |year=1922 |publisher=George H. Doran company |location= |isbn= |page=136 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=kmdsTJHmJoWUjAfj1cjjAQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=i2nSAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=people%27s+budget+introduced&amp;q=april+29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, but contention between the government and the Lords continued until the second general election in [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]], when the Unionists were again outpolled by their combined opponents. The result was another hung parliament, with the Liberals again relying on Labour and the Irish Parliamentary Party. Nonetheless, the Lords passed the [[Parliament Act 1911]] when faced with the threat, obtained from a narrowly convinced new King ([[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], Edward VII having died on 6 May 1910, seven days after the Budget was passed), that it would be acceptable to flood the House of Lords with hundreds of new Liberal Party peers to give that party a majority or near-majority there.

''The Presidential Committee on Young Generation (PCYG)'' is an advisory board that is directly affiliated to the president of the [[Republic of Korea]]. It is led by '''Minwoo Nam, head of the Korea Venture Business Association and CEO of Dasan Networks'''.  The committee, established on July 13, 2013, advises the President on Young Generation (YG) issues such as job creation, communications with the YG, and policy making.

== Basis of the Establishment ==
Presidential decree on the establishment of the PCYG [https://archive.is/20131007062858/http://inglaw.moleg.go.kr/PS/lbicInfoR.do?dataType=LBIC&amp;lbPmtStpCd=700104&amp;lbicId=2000000017675&amp;lsCls=LS2&amp;orderLbPmtSts=&amp;orderLsCls=&amp;orderLsNm=&amp;orderMgtDt=&amp;orderOfi=&amp;orgCd=&amp;orgClsCd=OFI&amp;pageIndex=1&amp;searchAncYy=&amp;searchLsNm=&amp;selLMn=&amp;topMn=02]

== General ==
The committee was formed to strengthen communications between the government and the young generation (YG), to make policy-making processes for the YG more effective. The government has defined the YG as those aged between 19~39.  The major role of the committee, is to advise the president about policy-making issues on the YG. Having ‘Field, People, and Collective Labour’ as its main theme for the operation, the committee also takes a role as a mediator between the government departments throughout the policy-making processes related to YG issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://young.go.kr PCYG Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The PCYG has two divisions; the ''committee board'' and the ''working group''. The committee board consists of 24 members, including nineteen civilian and five governmental members. The members include young leaders with wide experience in various fields, including young entrepreneurs, international volunteers and mentoring activities.  The committee board has three sub-committees, whose titles are shown in the organizational structure on the right-hand side. The working group is divided into the two teams, ‘policy team’ and ‘communications team.’
[[File:PCYG Organization.jpg|thumb|organizational structure of the PCYG]]

== Operative Functions ==
The PCYG functions in the following three areas;
# Job creation: discovering jobs in public/private sectors, building young generation-friendly business environment, sponsoring international job searching (K-Move)
# YG Policy Development: mediating YG policy fragmented throughout the government departments, supporting government projects related to the YG
# Communications/nurturing the YG: online and offline communications, encouraging innovation, nurturing programs such as mentoring&lt;ref&gt;(Korean) 위클리 공감 No.220 (12 Aug. 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operation process ===
The PCYG collects voices from the YG in various fields and discusses the raised issues. It then gathers opinions from the government departments on the issues and mediates between them to report to the president. After the reports, it monitors policy practices executed by the departments and receives feedback from them.

== Address ==
Presidential Committee on Young Generation
12th floor, KT Building, Sejong-roh 100, Jongno-gu, Seoul.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6867">In the [[law]] of [[evidence]], a '''presumption''' of a particular fact can be made without the aid of proof in some situations. The invocation of a presumption shifts the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] from one party to the opposing party in a court trial.

There are two types of presumption: [[rebuttable presumption]] and [[conclusive presumption]]. A rebuttable presumption is assumed true until a person proves otherwise (for example the [[presumption of innocence]]). In contrast, a conclusive (or irrebuttable) presumption cannot be refuted in any case (such as [[defense of infancy]] in some legal systems).

Presumptions are sometimes categorized into two types: presumptions without basic facts, and presumptions with basic facts. In the United States, mandatory presumptions are impermissible in criminal cases, but permissible presumptions are allowed.

An example of presumption without basic facts is [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the presumption of innocence is not a presumption, but rather is a rhetorical expression that emphasizes that the prosecution bears the burden of proof in a criminal case. The accused has no obligation to adduce evidence in their favor and is automatically acquitted unless the prosecution proves guilt [[beyond a reasonable doubt]]. See [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of presumption ''with'' basic facts is [[Declared death in absentia]], e.g., the law says if a person has been missing for seven years or more (basic fact), that person is presumed dead.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==History==

The ancient Jewish law code, the [[Talmud]], included reasoning from presumptions (''hazakah''), propositions taken to be true unless there was reason to believe otherwise, such as "One does not ordinarily pay a debt before term."&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same concept was found in ancient [[Roman law]], where, for example, if there was doubt as to whether a child was really the issue of someone who had left money in a will, the presumption was in favour of the child.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Roman and [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] graded presumptions according to strength: light, medium or probable, and violent.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt; These gradings and many individual presumptions were taken over into [[English law]] in the seventeenth century by [[Edward Coke]].&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific presumptions==
A number of presumptions are found in most [[common law]] jurisdictions.  Examples of these presumptions include:
*The [[presumption of death]].  A person who has been absent for seven years without explanation and "gone to parts unknown" is presumed dead at common law.&lt;ref&gt;''Prudential Insurance Comp. v. Moore'', 197 Ind. 50, 149 N.E. 718 (Ind. 1925)&lt;/ref&gt;  The time period it takes for the presumption to arise has often been modified by statute.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ind. Code § 29-2-5-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[presumption of sanity]]. A person who faces criminal trial is presumed sane until the opposite is proved.  Similarly, a person is presumed to have testamentary capacity until there is evidence to undermine that presumption.
*The [[presumption of innocence]], which holds that the prosecution bears the burden of proof in a criminal case with the result that the accused may be acquitted without putting forward any evidence.
*The [[presumption of legitimacy]] or [[presumption of paternity]], which presumes that a husband is the [[biological father]] of a child born to his wife during the marriage, or within nine months after the marriage is ended by death, [[legal separation]], or [[divorce]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ind. Code § 31-14-7-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some jurisdictions also hold that a presumption of paternity arises when a father accepts a child into his home, or publicly represents that he is the child's father.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ind. Code § 31-14-7-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[presumption of survivorship]] has referred to a number of different presumptions.  The term is sometimes used to refer to presumptions that one or another of two persons lived the longer when [[simultaneous death|they died together in the same accident]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] (5th. ed., 1979; West Publishing Co., {{ISBN|0-8299-2041-2}}), p. 1068, "Presumption of survivorship"&lt;/ref&gt;  The presumption that two or more people who establish a [[joint account]] intend for the survivors to have the assets put into the fund upon the death of one of the joint account holders has also been called the "presumption of survivorship".&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''Matter of Estate of Banko'', 622 N.E.2d 476 (Ind. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[presumption of mailing]] presumes that a properly addressed letter delivered to the post office or a [[common carrier]] was in fact delivered and received by the addressee.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''U-Haul Co. of Indiana, Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of State Revenue'', 896 N.E.2d 1253 (Ind.Tax 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The presumption of [[fraud]] or [[undue influence]] arises where a person in a position of [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] over another, such as a [[guardianship|guardian]] or the holder of a [[power of attorney]] applies the other person's assets to his or her own benefit.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Estate of Compton'', 919 N.E.2d 1181, (Ind.Ct.App. 2010), trans. denied&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[presumption of validity]] is another way of expressing a burden of proof: the official acts of courts are presumed valid, and those who would challenge them must overcome this presumption.&lt;ref&gt;''Monon Corp. v. Townsend, Yosha, Cline &amp; Price'', 678 N.E.2d 807, 809 (Ind.Ct.App. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; This is also termed the [[presumption of regularity]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Simon &amp; Murphy, Peter &amp; Beaumont, John. Cases &amp; Materials on Evidence. Fourth Edition. Oxford University Press. 1994. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[presumption of advancement]] in relation to transfers from husbands to wives and from fathers to children.
*In the law of the United States, the [[presumption of constitutionality]] presumes that all statutes are drafted in accordance with [[Constitution of the United States|Federal]] and [[State constitution (United States)|state]] constitutional requirements.  The party challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the burden of proof, and any doubts are resolved against that party. If there are two reasonable interpretations of a statute, one of which is constitutional and the other not, the courts choose the path that permits upholding the statute.&lt;ref&gt;''Boehm v. Town of St. John'', 675 N.E.2d 318 (Ind.1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14782">'''Economic loss''' is a [[technical terminology|term of art]]&lt;ref name=Sorensonetal_2012/&gt; which refers to financial loss and damage suffered by a person such as can be seen only on a [[balance sheet]] rather than as physical injury to the person or destruction of property. There is a fundamental distinction between '''pure economic loss''' and '''consequential economic loss''', as pure economic loss occurs independent of any physical damage to the person or property of the victim. It has also been suggested for it to be called "commercial loss" as injuries to person or property could be regarded as "economic".&lt;ref name=Sorensonetal_2012/&gt;

Examples of pure economic loss include the following:
*Loss of income suffered by a family whose principal earner dies in an accident. The physical injury is caused to the deceased, not the family.&lt;ref name="Baker v Bolton"&gt;{{cite BAILII||court=EWHC |division=KB |year=1808 |num=J92 |litigants=Baker v Bolton |parallelcite=(1808) 1 Camp 493 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Loss of market value of a property owing to the inadequate specifications of foundations by an [[architect]].&lt;ref name="Murphy v Brentwood District Council"&gt;{{cite BAILII||court=UKHL |year=1991 |num=2 |litigants=Murphy v Brentwood District Council |parallelcite=[1991] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 398 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|41|1985|litigants=[[Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman]] |parallelcite=(1985) 157 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 424, at 504-5 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Winnipeg Condominium Corporation No.36 v. Bird Construction Co.'' [1995] 1 SCR 85 (Canada)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Loss of production suffered by an enterprise whose electricity supply is interrupted by a contractor excavating a public utility.

The latter case is exemplified by the English case of ''[[Spartan Steel and Alloys Ltd v Martin &amp; Co Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Spartan Steel and Alloys Ltd v Martin &amp; Co Ltd]] |year=1972 |court=EWCA |divsion= Civ |num=3 |parallelcite=[1973] QB 27 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar losses are also restricted in [[German law]],{{sfn|van Gerven (2001)|pages=187-188}} though not in [[French law]] beyond the normal requirements that a claimant's asserted loss must be certain and directly caused.{{sfn|van Gerven (2001)|pages=198-199}}

==Common law jurisdictions==
Recovery at law for pure economic loss is restricted under some circumstances in some [[jurisdiction]]s, in particular in [[tort]] in [[common law]] jurisdictions, for fear that it is potentially unlimited and could represent a "crushing liability" against which parties would find it impossible to [[insurance|insure]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Canadian National Railway Co. v. Norsk Pacific Steamship Co.]]'' [1992] 1 SCR 1021 (Canada), ''per'' McLachlin J&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bishop (1982)}}

===Australia===

In Australia, the general rule is that damages for economic loss which are not consequential upon damage to person or property are not recoverable in negligence even if the loss is [[Remoteness in English law|foreseeable]].&lt;ref name="2014 HCA 36"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|2014|litigants=[[Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v Owners Corporation Strata Plan 61288]] |parallelcite=(2014) 254 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 185 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 127}} &lt;ref name="2004 HCA 16"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|16|2004|litigants=[[Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd]] |parallelcite=(2004) 216 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 515 |pinpoint=[22] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic loss may be recoverable in cases where the plaintiff can prove an assumption of responsibility by the defendant and known reliance on the defendant by the plaintiff,&lt;ref name="2014 HCA 36"/&gt;{{rp|para 128}} or vulnerability in the sense of the inability of the plaintiff to take steps to protect itself from the risk of the loss.&lt;ref name="2014 HCA 36"/&gt;{{rp|para 130}}

Cases in which the High Court has held that economic loss was recoverable include:

* ''Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge 'Willemstad''' (1976),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|65|1976|litigants=[[Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge 'Willemstad']] |parallelcite=(1976) 136 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 529 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Caltex]] was permitted to recover the economic loss it suffered when a [[dredge]] severed an [[oil pipeline]]. Caltex was not directly affected by the loss of the oil, because that risk was borne by another company, but it suffered loss in obtaining oil by another means of transport while the pipeline was repaired. The loss was recoverable because the defendants knew or should have known that Caltex would suffer it.

===Canada===

Justice Cardozo's [[#United_States|indeterminacy concerns]] were relied on by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] to restrict imposing liability on a corporation's auditors for negligently auditing the corporation's financial statements.  In Hercules Management v Ernst &amp; Young, [1997] 2 SCR 165.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hercules Management v Ernst &amp; Young|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1511/index.do|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court determined that the auditors owed investors of the company a duty of care, and that the auditors had been negligent in conducting their audit.  However, La Forest J, writing for a unanimous court, declined to impose liability on the auditors for policy reasons, citing Justice Cardozo's concerns over indeterminate liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hercules Management v Ernst &amp; Young|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1511/index.do |ref=at para 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
{{main|Pure economic loss in English law}}

Pure economic loss was not recoverable in negligence until 1963 and the decision of the House of Lords in ''[[Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd]]'' (1964).  Up until ''Hedley Byrne'' was decided, pure economic loss was thought to be entirely within the realm of contract law.&lt;ref name="Hedley Byrne"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd |court=UKHL |year=1963 |num=4 |parallelcite=[1964] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 465 |courtname=auto}} "It must now be taken that Derry v Peek did not establish any universal rule that in the absence of contract an innocent but negligent misrepresentation cannot give rise to an action. It is true Lord Bramwell said (at p. 347):" To found an action for damages there must be a contract and breach, or "fraud." And for the next twenty years it was generally assumed that Derry v Peek decided that. But it was shown in this House in Nocton v Ashburton [1914] A.C. 932 that that is much too widely stated. We cannot, therefore, now accept as accurate the numerous statements to that effect in cases between 1889 and 1914, and we must now determine the extent of the exceptions to that rule."&lt;/ref&gt; From that point on, in jurisdictions following the English common law, it has been possible to recover for some pure economic loss in negligence; however, because purely economic loss can usually be anticipated and allocated differently by contract, the party seeking to be compensated for such loss must demonstrate a compelling reason to change the contractual allocation through tort liability.

===Malaysia===

In Malaysia, the Federal Court in ''Majlis Perbandaran Ampang v Steven Phoa Cheng Loon'' [2006] 2 AMR 563 followed the decision in ''Caparo Industries v Dickman'' [1990] UKHL 2 where it held; pure economic loss is claimable if 1) the damage was foreseeable, 2) the relationship between the parties was one of sufficient proximity, and 3) it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on the defendant.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], Chief Judge [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] famously described pure economic loss as "liability in an indeterminate amount, for an indeterminate time, to an indeterminate class."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ultramares Corporation v. Touche]]'', 174 N.E 441, 444 (N.Y. 1931).&lt;/ref&gt; The rule may also be traced back to [[Roger Traynor]]'s decision in the California case ''Seely v. White Motor Co.'' (1965), and was later adopted by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''East River Steamship Corp V Transamerica Delaval Inc.'' (1986).&lt;ref name=Sorensonetal_2012&gt;Sorenson T, Davidson M, White M. (2012). [http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/litigation/materials/2012_cccle_materials/12_tort.authcheckdam.pdf When Can A Breach of Contract Be a Tort and What Difference Does it Make?]. American Bar Association CLE Seminar.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few [[state supreme court]]s in the United States have departed from the majority rule and authorized recovery for pure economic loss through tort causes of action (usually negligence).   The first was California in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;''[[J'Aire Corp. v. Gregory]]'', 24 Cal. 3d 799, 598 P.2d 60, 157 Cal. Rptr. 407 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; followed later by New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;''People Express Airlines, Inc. v. Consol. Rail. Corp.'', 495 A.2d 107, 109 (N.J. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; and Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;''Mattingly v. Sheldon Jackson Coll.'', 743 P.2d 356, 359–61 (Alaska 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law jurisdictions==

===Germany===
The general rule of tort liability under German law is supplied by section 823 of the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] (BGB), which does not provide for damages for pure economic loss.{{sfn|Bussani &amp; Palmer|2003|p=148}} However, the courts have interpreted BGB provisions imposing liability for harms caused by actions contrary to public policy or statute to allow for pure economic loss damages.{{sfn|Bussani &amp; Palmer|2003|p=148}}

Contractual liability for pure economic loss is recognized in German law. As a result, German courts have often turned to a contract theory to impose liability.{{sfn|Bussani &amp; Palmer|2003|p=150}} Such liability may be imposed even without [[privity of contract]].{{sfn|Bussani &amp; Palmer|2003|p=150}}

In addition, liability for pure economic loss may be imposed under German law in the case of special relationships, such as the relationship of a [[guardianship|guardian]] to a ward, in which the guardian may be subject to liability for pure economic loss if the guardian is at fault.&lt;ref&gt;§ 1833 BGB.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===

Sweden adopted general principles of tort liability for the first time in 1972 with the adoption of the Tort Liability Act (''skadeståndslagen'', SKL).{{sfn|Bussani &amp; Palmer|2003|p=156}} Previously, liability had been largely confined to cases in which a crime had been committed.{{sfn|Bussani &amp; Palmer|2003|p=156}} Under the SKL, that limitation continues to apply in cases involving pure economic loss: it is available only when a crime has been committed.{{sfn|Bussani &amp; Palmer|2003|p=157}}  However, in more recent decades, some Swedish court decisions have allowed damages for pure economic loss in exceptional circumstances even when there is no underlying crime.{{sfn|Bussani &amp; Palmer|2003|p=158}}

{{Liberalism sidebar |Variants}}

'''Secular liberalism''' is the separation of [[culture]] and [[politics]] from [[religion]]. A subcategory of [[liberalism]] and [[secularism]], it supports the [[separation of religion and state]] particularly from the ideas of the [[Christian Church]]. Christian ideals are usually to be found on the opposite end of the spectrum from secular liberalism. Secular liberalism is often connected with standing for [[social equality]] and [[political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref name="realclearpolitics"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/04/secular_liberalism_as_consensu.html |title = ''Secular Liberalism as Consensus'' |author=Rod Dreher |date=6 April 2011 |publisher = Real Clear Politics |accessdate = 9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/40148.html | title = ''Secular liberalism misunderstood''| publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = | accessdate = 2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
Adherents of secular liberalism believe in the [[disestablishment]] of the Christian Church.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/29/clegg-disestablishment-church-england | title = ''Clegg should assert secular liberalism''| publisher = The Guardian | date = 29 April 2010| accessdate = 2011-06-09 | location=London | first=Theo | last=Hobson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular liberalism also depends on the conviction that religious tradition and belief has no binding authority on society.&lt;ref name="realclearpolitics"/&gt; Public promoters of secular liberalism, such as Dawkins call for a clear distinction between the teaching of religion as a historical and cultural phenomenon and the teaching of religion as fact. Dawkins has likened using education to indoctrinate children with a particular religion to [[child abuse]]. One of the central tenets of the ideology is separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Among those who follow secular liberalism are [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Ayaan Hirshi Ali]] and [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]].&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

Practices that are considered to be illiberal are reformed in a state that practices secular liberalism.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/29/clegg-disestablishment-church-england | title = Secular Liberalism and Moral Psychology of Identity''| publisher = Economic and Political Weekly| date = 1997-10-04| accessdate = 2012-02-21| location=London| first=Theo| last=Hobson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal measures have failed in the past because no effort is made to make a concept of the goods that the community has cherished in the past.&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt; This lack of reason-giving apparatus is called [[communitarianism]] and it used to criticize the liberal state as a coercive organization.&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt; Communitarianism essentially advocates a sense of intra-community (community-wide) democracy.&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt;

In a modern democratic society, a plurality of conflicting doctrines share an uneasy co-existence within the framework of civilization.

== Contemporary application ==
=== Arab Spring ===
Secular liberalism is sometimes connected with the [[Arab Spring]] protests. One commentator labels it as a "secular liberal fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/09/tahrir-square-aflame-imaginary-revolution |title=Tahrir Square aflame: the visual basis of an imaginary revolution |author=Jonathan Jones |date=9 December 2011 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 February 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have labeled the motivations behind it, and the temporary governments created as a result as secular liberalism.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= After the Arab Spring: How Islamists Hijacked the Middle East Revolts|last=Bradley |first=John |year= 2012|publisher= |location= |isbn= 0-230-33819-4|page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Islamism is Winning |author=John M. Owen IV |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/opinion/why-islamism-is-winning.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=6 January 2012 |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=Razib |year= 2012|title= Secular liberals the tip of the Islamist spear|journal= Discover Magazine|volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url= http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/01/secular-liberals-the-tip-of-the-islamist-spear/|accessdate=14 January 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Oftentimes, participation in the newly crowned democratic governments by the Muslim clerics are ignored in favor of the protesters' secular liberal ideas. Since 2011, more residents of the Middle East have been demanding a greater say in the running of their governments. They want democracy to appear in a uniquely Muslim fashion rather than through some artificial "secular" movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goingtotehran.com/2014/02 |title=America and the Middle East: It’s Déjà Vu All Over Again |author=Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann Leverett |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
The [[French ban on face covering]] has been attributed by some to be a result of secular liberalism.&lt;ref name="hizb"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hizb.org.uk/current-affairs/french-face-veil-ban-highlights-the-failings-of-secular-liberalism | title = French Face Veil Ban Highlights The Failings Of Secular Liberalism| publisher = Hizb ut-Tahrir | date = 14 September 2010| accessdate = 13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban by the [[French Senate]] on September 14, 2010 outlawed coverings, including religious ones such as the [[burqa]]. Some [[Islam in France|French Muslims]] have found secular liberalism to be an ideology where prejudice against a minority group is used to win [[vote]]s.&lt;ref name="hizb"/&gt; According to the [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] group, based out of the United Kingdom, women are secluded from society and made [[outcast (person)|outcast]]s in society for trying to be [[Modesty|modest]].&lt;ref name="hizb"/&gt; The group has also criticized other European countries for similar bans on religious dress.

== Criticism ==
The [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Moscow Patriarchate]] are waging a common fight against secular liberalism; claiming that this idea violates the traditional Christian concepts of family and human values by exposing people to medico-biological experiments that are incompatible with their ideas of human dignity.&lt;ref name="interfax"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=7927 | title = ''Moscow Patriarchate, Vatican wage common fight against secular liberalism - Patriarch Kirill''| publisher = Interfax-Religion | date = | accessdate = 2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of the Russian Orthodox Church expressed concern over trends in some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] communities towards liberalizing theology and Christian morals; he claims them to be products of secular liberalism.&lt;ref name="interfax"/&gt;

The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]], offering [[freedom of speech]], has been criticized in a 2004 political manifesto by [[David Fergusson (theologian)|David Fergusson]] entitled ''Church, state and civil society''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2092">In the context of [[corporate finance]], the '''tax benefits of debt''' or '''tax advantage of debt''' refers to the fact that from a tax perspective it is cheaper for firms and investors to finance with [[debt]] than with [[ownership equity|equity]]. Under a majority of [[tax|taxation systems]] around the world, and until recently under the [[taxation in the United States|United States tax system]], firms are taxed on their [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] and individuals are taxed on their [[personal income]]. 

For example, a firm that earns $100 in profits in the United States would have to pay around $30 in taxes. If it then distributes these profits to its owners as [[dividends]], then the owners in turn pay taxes on this income, say $20 on the $70 of dividends. The $100 of profits turned into $50 of investor income.

If, instead the firm finances with debt, then, assuming the firm owes $100 of interest to investors, its profits are now 0. Investors now pay taxes on their interest income, say $30. This implies for $100 of [[Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization|profits before taxes]], investors got $70.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~jgraham/HowBigFinalJF.pdf Graham, John, "How big are the Tax Benefits of Debt" The Journal of Finance, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This tax-related encouragement of debt financing has not gone uncriticized.&lt;ref name=Page&gt;Richard T. Page, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1724530 "Foolish Revenge or Shrewd Regulation? Financial-Industry Tax Law Reforms Proposed in the Wake of the Financial Crisis?"] 85 [[Tul. L. Rev.]] 191 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, some critics have argued that the cost of equity should also be deductible; which could reduce the [[Internal Revenue Code]]'s influence on [[capital-structure]] decisions, potentially reducing the economic instability attributable to excessive debt financing.&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt;

Although credited to both Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren, the article was apparently written primarily by Brandeis,&lt;ref&gt;Freund, Privacy: One Concept or Many, in NOMOS XIII:  PRIVACY 182, 184 (Pennock &amp;
Chapman eds. 1971), as cited in Glancy, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; on a suggestion of Warren based on his "deep-seated abhorrence of the invasions of social privacy."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Brandeis to Warren (April 8, 1905), p.&amp;nbsp;303 in ''Letters of Louis D. Brandeis, 1870–1907: Urban Reformer'', Volume 1 (Urofsky  &amp; Levy eds. 1971), as cited in Glancy, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]], in writing his own influential article on the [[Privacy law|privacy torts]] in American law,&lt;ref&gt;[[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]], "Privacy", 48 ''[[California Law Review]]'' 383 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt; attributed the specific incident to an intrusion by journalists on a society wedding,&lt;ref&gt;See Glancy, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; but in truth it was inspired by more general coverage of intimate personal lives in society columns of newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;See Glancy, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;6, referencing A. Mason, ''Brandeis: A Free Man's Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;70 (1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Right to Privacy" is brief by modern [[law review]] standards, comprising only 7222 words, excluding citations.

=== Introduction and background ===
Warren and Brandeis begin their article by introducing the fundamental principle that "the individual shall have full protection in person and in property." They acknowledge that this is a fluid principle that has been reconfigured over the centuries as a result of political, social, and economic change.

The first three paragraphs of the essay describe the development of the common law with regard to life and property. Originally, the common law "right to life" only provided a remedy for physical interference with life and property. But later, the scope of the "right to life" expanded to recognize the "legal value of sensations." For example, the action of [[Battery (crime)|battery]]—a protection against actual bodily injury—gave rise to the action of [[assault]]—fear of actual bodily injury. Similarly, the concept of property expanded from protecting only tangible property to intangible property.

Beginning with the fourth paragraph, Warren and Brandeis explain the desirability and necessity that the common law adapt to recent inventions and business methods—namely, the advent of instantaneous photography and the widespread circulation of newspapers, both of which have contributed to the invasion of an individual's privacy. Warren and Brandeis take this opportunity to excoriate the practices of journalists of their time, particularly aiming at society gossip pages:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The press is overstepping in every direction the obvious bounds of propriety and of decency. Gossip is no longer the resource of the idle and of the vicious, but has become a trade, which is pursued with industry as well as effrontery. To satisfy a prurient taste the details of sexual relations are spread broadcast in the columns of the daily papers. To occupy the indolent, column upon column is filled with idle gossip, which can only be procured by intrusion upon the domestic circle.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Defining "privacy" ===
The authors state the purpose of the article: "It is our purpose to consider whether the existing law affords a principle which can properly be invoked to protect the privacy of the individual; and, if it does, what the nature and extent of such protection is."

First, Warren and Brandeis examine the law of [[slander]] and [[libel]] (forms of defamation) to determine if it adequately protects the privacy of the individual. The authors conclude that this body of law is insufficient to protect the privacy of the individual because it "deals only with damage to reputation." In other words, defamation law, regardless of how widely circulated or unsuited to publicity, requires that the individual suffer a direct effect in his or her interaction with other people. The authors write: "However painful the mental effects upon another of an act, though purely wanton or even malicious, yet if the act itself is otherwise lawful, the suffering inflicted is ''[[damnum absque injuria]]'' " (a loss or harm from something other than a wrongful act and which occasions no legal remedy).

Second, in the next several paragraphs, the authors examine [[intellectual property law]] to determine if its principles and doctrines may sufficiently protect the privacy of the individual. Warren and Brandeis concluded that "the protection afforded to thoughts, sentiments, and emotions, expressed through the medium of writing or of the arts, so far as it consists in preventing publication, is merely an instance of the enforcement of the more general right of the individual to be let alone."

Warren and Brandeis then discuss the origin of what they called a "right to be let alone".  They explain that the right of property provides the foundation for the right to prevent publication. But at the time the right of property only protected the right of the creator to any profits derived from the publication. The law did not yet recognize the idea that there was value in preventing publication. As a result, the ability to prevent publication did not clearly exist as a right of property.

The authors proceed to examine case law regarding a person's ability to prevent publication. Warren and Brandeis observed that, although the court in ''[[Prince Albert v. Strange]]'' asserted that its decision was based on the protection of property, a close examination of the reasoning reveals the existence of other unspecified rights—that is, the right to be let alone.

If this conclusion is correct, then existing law does afford "a principle which may be invoked to protect the privacy of the individual from invasion either by the too enterprising press, the photographer, or the possessor of any other modern device for recording or reproducing scenes or sounds."

Furthermore, Warren and Brandeis suggest the existence of a right to privacy based on the jurisdictional justifications used by the courts to protect material from publication. The article states, "where protection has been afforded against wrongful publication, the jurisdiction has been asserted, not on the ground of property, or at least not wholly on that ground, but upon the ground of an alleged breach of an implied contract or of a trust or confidence."

Warren and Brandeis proceed to point out that: "This protection of implying a term in a contract, or of implying a trust, is nothing more nor less than a judicial declaration that public morality, private justice, and general convenience demand the recognition of such a rule." In other words, the courts created a [[legal fiction]] that contracts implied a provision against publication or that a relationship of trust mandated nondisclosure.

Yet, the article raises a problematic scenario where a casual recipient of a letter, who did not solicit the correspondence, opens and reads the letter. Simply by receiving, opening, and reading a letter the recipient does not create any contract or accept any trust.

Warren and Brandeis argue that courts have no justification to prohibit the publication of such a letter, under existing theories or property rights.  Rather, they argue, "the principle which protects personal writings and any other productions of the intellect or the emotions, is the right to privacy."

=== Limitations ===
Finally, Warren and Brandeis consider the remedies and limitations of the newly conceived right to privacy. The authors acknowledge that the exact contours of the new theory are impossible to determine, but several guiding principles from tort law and intellectual property law are applicable.

The applicable limitations are:

1. "The right to privacy does not prohibit any publication of matter which is of public or general interest." Warren and Brandeis elaborate on this exception to the right to privacy by stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In general, then, the matters of which the publication should be repressed may be described as those which concern the private life, habits, acts, and relations of an individual, and have no legitimate connection with his fitness for a public office which he seeks or for which he is suggested, . . . and have no legitimate relation to or bearing upon any act done by him in a public or quasi public capacity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

2. The right to privacy does not prohibit the communication of any matter, though in its nature private, when the publication is made under circumstances which would render it a privileged communication according to the law of slander and libel.

3. The law would probably not grant any redress for the invasion of privacy by oral publication in the absence of special damage.

4. The right to privacy ceases upon the publication of the facts by the individual, or with his consent.

5. The truth of the matter published does not afford a defense.

6. The absence of "malice" in the publisher does not afford a defense.

With regard to remedies, a plaintiff may institute an action for tort damages as compensation for injury or, alternatively, request an injunction.

As a closing note, Warren and Brandeis suggest that criminal penalties should be imposed for violations of the right to privacy, but the pair decline to further elaborate on the matter, deferring instead to the authority of the legislature.

==Reception and influence==

The article "immediately"&lt;ref&gt;Glancy 1979, pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7, citing "The Right to Be Let Alone", ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', v.&amp;nbsp;67, pp.&amp;nbsp;428–429 (1891) and "The Defense of Privacy", ''[[The Spectator]]'' v.&amp;nbsp;266, n.&amp;nbsp;200 (Feb. 7, 1891).&lt;/ref&gt; received a strong reception and continues to be a touchstone of modern discussions of privacy law.

[[Roscoe Pound]] noted in 1916, some 25 years after the essay's publication, that Warren and Brandeis were responsible for "nothing less than adding a chapter to our law."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Roscoe Pound]] to [[William E. Chilton|William Chilton]] (1916), quoted in A. Mason, ''Brandeis: A Free Man's Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;70 (1956), cited by Glancy 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; Some decades later, in a highly cited article of his own, [[Melville B. Nimmer]] described Warren and Brandeis' essay as "perhaps the most famous and certainly the most influential law review article ever written", attributing the recognition of the common law right of privacy by some 15 state courts in the United States directly to "The Right to Privacy".&lt;ref&gt;Melville B. Nimmer, 1954, [http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2595&amp;context=lcp "The Right of Publicity"], ''Law and Contemporary Problems'', p.&amp;nbsp;203.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, [[William L. Prosser]]'s article "Privacy" (itself enormously influential in the field), described the circumstances of the article and its importance thusly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The matter came to a head when the newspapers had a field day on the occasion of the wedding of a daughter, and Mr. Warren became annoyed. It was an annoyance for which the press, the advertisers and the entertainment industry of America were to pay dearly over the next seventy years. Mr. Warren turned to his recent law partner, Louis D. Brandeis, who was destined not to be unknown to history. The result was a noted article, ''The Right to Privacy'', in the ''Harvard Law Review'', upon which the two men collaborated. It has come to be regarded as the outstanding example of the influence of legal periodicals upon the American law.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Prosser, "Privacy", 48 ''[[California Law Review]]'' 383, at 384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contemporary scholar Neil M. Richards notes that this article and Brandeis' dissent in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' together "are the foundation of American privacy law".&lt;ref&gt;Neil M. Richards, [http://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/articles/2010/10/Richards-Brandeis-Privacy-and-Speech-63-Vand.-L.-Rev.-1295-2010.pdf "The Puzzle of Brandeis, Privacy, and Speech"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001804/http://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/articles/2010/10/Richards-Brandeis-Privacy-and-Speech-63-Vand.-L.-Rev.-1295-2010.pdf |date=2013-12-03 }}, ''Vanderbilt Law Review'', v.&amp;nbsp;63, n.&amp;nbsp;5, pp.&amp;nbsp;1295–1352, pp.&amp;nbsp;1295–1296.&lt;/ref&gt;  Richards and [[Daniel Solove]] note that Warren and Brandeis popularized privacy with the article, giving credit to [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]] for being privacy law's chief architect but calling for privacy law to "regain some of Warren and Brandeis's dynamism."&lt;ref&gt;Neil M. Richards &amp; Daniel J. Solove, [http://www.californialawreview.org/assets/pdfs/98-6/RichardsSolove.FINAL.pdf "Prosser's Privacy Law: A Mixed Legacy"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629102747/http://www.californialawreview.org/assets/pdfs/98-6/RichardsSolove.FINAL.pdf |date=2011-06-29 }}, ''[[California Law Review]]'', v.&amp;nbsp;98, pp.&amp;nbsp;1887–1924, disc. pp.&amp;nbsp;1887–1888 and 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; The Olmstead decision was later overruled in the [[Katz v. United States|''Katz v United States (1967)'']] court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Vernon Valentine|date=Jan 2011|title=Three Milestones in the History of Privacy in the United States.|url=|journal=Tulane European &amp; Civil Law Forum|volume=26|pages=67–97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''user charge''' is a charge for the use of a product or service.  A user charge may apply per use of the good or service or for the use of the good or service.  The first is a charge for each time while the second is a charge for bulk or time-limited use.

==Government user charges==
===United States Government user charges===

The federal government [[Office of Management and Budget]] has set forth policies for setting user charges by the United States Government in "Circular No. A-25 Revised".&lt;ref name="White House circular"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a025/a025.html Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-25 Revised]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the policies established, the government may:
* Apply user charges against identifiable recipients who enjoy special benefits derived from federal activities beyond those received by the general public;
* Set user charges sufficient to recover the full cost to the federal government of providing the service, resource or good provided by the government; and,
* Whenever possible set the charges at rates rather than fixed dollar amounts in order to adjust for changes in costs to the government or changes in market prices for provided goods, resources, or services.

===European Environmental Agency user charges===

The Environmental Terminology and Discovery Service (ETDS) defines a user charge as a "Charge paid for a specific environmental service provided to the charge payer. Example: treating wastewater or disposing of waste."&lt;ref&gt;[http://glossary.eea.europa.eu/EEAGlossary/U/user_charge European Environment Agency: User charge definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman human rights defender can be an Indigenous woman fighting for the rights of her community, a woman advocating against torture, an [[Intersex and LGBT|LGBTQI]] rights campaigner, a sex workers’ rights collective, or a man fighting for sexual and reproductive rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Like other [[human rights defenders]], women human rights defenders can be the target of attacks as they demand the realization of human rights. They face attacks such as discrimination, assault, threats, and violence within their communities.  However, women human rights defenders face additional obstacles based on who they are and the specific rights they defend. This means they are targeted just because they are women, LGBTI people or for identifying with their struggles. They also face additional obstacles connected with systemic discrimination and inequality and because they challenge, or are seen to be challenging, patriarchal power and social norms. They are more at risk of facing gender based violence in the home and the community, and sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, trans-phobic threats, smears and stigmatization, as well as exclusion from resources and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act30/6011/2017/en/|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20936&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR {{!}} International Women Human Rights Defenders Day –29 November 2016|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women that work to fight for human rights have numerous meetings with the UN Human Rights Council in conjunction with the LGBTQI defenders in Uganda who face prejudice and discrimination as well for The Women Human Rights Defenders understand the struggles being endured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defendingwomen-defendingrights.org/our-work/|title=Our Work {{!}}|website=www.defendingwomen-defendingrights.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
