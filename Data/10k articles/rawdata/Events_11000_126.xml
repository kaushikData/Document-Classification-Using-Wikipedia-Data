      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36540">The procedures and traditions surrounding academic graduation ceremonies differ around the world.

== India ==

In India the graduation ceremony is commonly known as convocation. At the universities and institutes, the graduation ceremonies are formal affairs, which include an academic procession by both the academic heads and the students.

===Indian Institutes of Technology===

All the Indian Institutes of Technologies (IITs) celebrate a convocation ceremony. A chief guest is invited for the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iitg.ernet.in/acad/17convocation/convocation.html |title=IITG convocation |publisher=iitg.ac.in |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527191934/http://iitg.ernet.in/acad/17convocation/convocation.html |archivedate=2015-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Japan ==

===Elementary and secondary schools===
Underclassmen, parents, and teachers are seated first. The vice principal leads in the local officials and special guests. The teachers all stand and [[Bowing#Bowing in Japan and Korea|bow]] to them as they enter. When the graduates enter, they are led by their homeroom teachers. Everyone walks very slow and deliberate. They walk in straight lines and make 90 degree turns if turning is necessary. The students line up next to their chairs and wait for the home room teacher to signal and they all sit at once. The homeroom teacher then joins the rest of the teachers. The head of ceremonies asks everyone to stand and bow towards the Japanese flag. This is coordinated by playing three chords on the piano. 1st-prepare, 2nd-bow, 3rd-return upright.

Singing has a large part in the Japanese schools curriculum and is also a big part of graduation. The first song is [[Japanese national anthem|Japan's national anthem]], followed by the city song and the school song. The latter two are usually printed in the program. This is the last time the graduating class will sing the school song together with the rest of the school. At this point, or after diplomas, the lower class sings to the graduating class, and the graduating class to the lower class. Then everyone sings together. Some of the possible songs are: ''Tabidachi no Hi ni'' [[:ja:旅立ちの日に]], ''Sayonara'', ''Until the World is One'' by [[Ya-Ya-Yah]], ''Sakura'' by [[Naotaro Moriyama]] [[:ja:さくら (森山直太朗の曲)]], ''[[Aogeba Tōtoshi]]'' and ''[[Hotaru no Hikari]]'' (sung to the tune of [[Auld Lang Syne]]).

After singing has finished the principal, wearing a Japanese style tuxedo or [[black tie]] goes to the podium. Usually a female teacher wearing a [[hakama]] brings out diplomas on a large tray. The homeroom teacher for each class calls out the names of his or her students in gender-split alphabetical order. Recently some schools have discontinued splitting the class by gender. Students stand and say "はい" (hai), Japanese for "yes". Large classes may only have their names called. Smaller classes might have each student go to the stage and receive their diploma. They queue up, walking in straight lines, 90 degree turns, at a deliberately slow pace. At some elementary schools the students give a short speech about what they want to do at Junior High before receiving their diplomas.

The principal reads the diploma out loud once to the first student in each class. The diploma is handed over full size in an open cover (not rolled-up). The principal rotates the diploma to face the student and hands it to them. The student receives the diploma by using their left hand first, and then their right hand before pulling it towards them. The student steps back and exchanges bows with the principal. The student then slowly closes the diploma and folds it under their left hand before turning and walking away. Returning to their seats, students stop and bow to the special guests.

After all the students are seated again the principal makes a speech. The speeches are [[Japanese writing system#Direction of writing|written]] vertically from top to bottom, right to left on a fan folded piece of paper. The principal's speech is followed by the head of the PTA. At junior high school an underclassmen may give a speech thanking the graduating students for things like being good [[Senpai and kōhai|senpai]]. And this is followed by a student speech from the student president. Students may give set group speeches, as if a dialogue between the lower class and upper class. Students take turns yelling out parts of the dialogue sometimes being accompanied by everyone or a few other students in unison. This might happen before, in-between and/or after the songs.

After ceremony students may get a final address by their homeroom teacher. A few moments later, the graduates are free to roam around the school, in and out of the teachers’ office. At Junior High school, students take everything with them on the last day and may do school cheers with the underclassman in front of the school. The school calendar does not end with graduation. The next business day after the ceremony 1st and 2nd year students continue classes until spring break officially starts.

==Philippines==
'''''Graduation''''' is the award or acceptance of an academic degree or diploma . For Filipinos, the term “graduation” usually refers to the graduation ceremonies undergone by graduates who have finished a level of education. Some view a person as having truly graduated only if they have “marched” onstage to accept their diploma during the graduation ceremonies. Thus, graduation may be also considered a coming-of-age ritual for young Filipinos.
Graduation ceremonies are held at the end of March or, in some cases, the beginning of April of every year.

Filipinos take part in a graduation ceremony every time they complete an educational level. These ceremonies are usually held for graduation from kindergarten, elementary school, high school, vocational school or college, and graduate school. 
Attire
In past decades, [[elementary school]] and high school graduates usually wore white: white dresses for girls and white polo shirts and black pants for boys. The same went for kindergarten “graduates” except that girls usually wore identical dresses in a style and color agreed upon by the parents. Recent trends call for togas and mortarboards as standard graduation attire. The Department of Education also recently called for austerity measures, prohibiting extravagant spending and requiring students to wear only their school uniforms under their togas.

Graduates of [[vocational schools]] and [[colleges]] usually wear togas and [[mortarboards]] or caps. These are usually black, except for those colleges and universities who have togas made in the school colors. Underneath, the graduates wear formal clothes which may range from “Sunday best” to party attire.

Those who finish post-graduate studies usually wear slightly different togas from those who finish undergraduate degrees. They also wear hoods banded with the color associated with their particular post-graduate [[course (education)|course]].

All [[graduates]] usually wear [[corsages]] pinned on the left lapel or left breast of their clothing.

'''''Baccalaureate Mass'''''
High school graduation ceremonies usually have a baccalaureate mass before the actual graduation ceremonies begin. This is especially true if the school is Catholic. Elementary school and college/post-graduate school graduations may or may not have baccalaureate masses.

[[Universities]] and colleges usually celebrate the [[baccalaureate mass]] and baccalaureate ceremonies on a separate day, usually the day before the graduation ceremonies. This is especially true if the school is Catholic. On this day, the awards for extra-curricular and co-curricular activities are given out, leaving only the major academic awards to be given on the graduation day itself.
 
'''''[[Awards]]'''''
The giving of awards for extra-curricular, co-curricular and academic activities are not the same throughout the country. Schools may give out all the awards on graduation day itself, or may do so on a separate day before the graduation ceremonies.

Schools with a small student population usually opt to give out all awards on graduation day itself. However, bigger schools may give out lesser awards on the day before, which is called Recognition Day or Baccalaureate Day. These awards include those for extra-curricular and co-curricular activities like Athlete of the Year and Dancer of the Year, as well as “good conduct” awards such as "Most Behaved" and "Most Neat and Clean". The number and name of the awards may vary from school to school, depending on whom the teachers wish to honor.

The major academic awards given out on graduation day for elementary and high school are the awards for valedictorian, salutatorian and honorable mention. Many schools give awards to their top five graduates as follows: valedictorian, salutatorian, and first, second and third honorable mentions. The other awards are usually the Leadership Award and the awards for those who topped the different subjects. The latter are usually referred to as the “Bests”, since they start with the words “Best in...” such as, for example, “Best in Math”.

College and post-graduate schools usually award the following awards: summa cum laude (with highest honors), magna cum laude (with high honors), and cum laude (with honors). Unlike the awards given in elementary and high schools which depend on class ranking, undergraduate and post-graduate awards are given based on grade point averages, so that there may be more than one graduate with the same award, or in many cases, none at all.

Awards are usually given in the form of ribbons on which are printed the name of the award, or medals with the name of the award engraved on the back, as well as certificates.

'''''Ceremony'''''
Although ceremonies vary from school to school, certain basic elements are usually the same. A typical graduation ceremony starts with the processional, which in some cases consists of the graduating class and their parents who formally walk side by side into the venue for the ceremony. Some schools have the students leave their parents at their designated seats. Boys then go up on the stage from the left and girls from the right. The two lines meet in center stage and go down the front steps, each pair bowing to the audience just before they reach the top step.

After the processional comes the invocation, which may either be spoken or sung by a choir or by the graduates themselves. Then, the [[Lupang Hinirang|national anthem]] is sung and the salutatorian gives their salutatory address which serves as the welcome address or opening remarks. The keynote speaker is then introduced. This speaker may be a notable person, a person of some authority or influence, or even a former student who has made good in their chosen field and whom the school feels should be an inspiration to the graduates. After the keynote address, the school principal, or chancellor in the case of universities, presents the graduates to the representative of the appropriate government institution by having them stand up. The representative in turn declares the students graduates. After this declaration, the graduates are then awarded their diplomas.

The actual [[diploma]]s usually are not awarded during the ceremonies; the graduates get their diplomas and other pertinent papers after they have complied with their clearance. In the past, schools usually handed out rolls of paper tied with a ribbon, symbolizing the diplomas. A graduate came on stage when their name was called, accepted the diploma with their right hand, then transferred it to their left hand and shook the hand of the person awarding the diploma. The graduate then went front and center, held the roll of paper at a slant between their hands, left hand at the bottom and right hand at the top, and bowed, then went down the steps and back to their seat. Present trends, however, are for schools to give out leatherette diploma holders during the ceremony, thus eliminating the need for the formal bow and expediting the ceremony. After the awarding of diplomas, the class valedictorian then gives their valedictory address and leads the school pledge of loyalty. The graduates then sing their graduation song and the awards for outstanding graduates are then given out.

After the awards, the school [[Head teacher|principal]] then gives the closing remarks and the graduates may sing their closing song. The students and parents then exit the area with a formal recessional. However, they then usually return to have their souvenir pictures taken on the stage.

Candlelight ceremonies are usually held during high school junior-senior (JS) proms. However, some elementary schools in the provinces made candlelight ceremonies part of the graduation rites. In the original candlelight ceremony for proms, the senior class president usually lit a large ceremonial candle on the stage, then lit their own candle from this flame and symbolically “passed the flame” to the junior class president. The member of the senior class nearest the stage then went up to light their candle and went down to pass the flame to the other seniors, who would then give their lit candles to the juniors.

For elementary school [[graduation rites]], the graduating class sings “[[One Little Candle]]” while the class valedictorian lights the ceremonial candle then passes the flame to the other graduates. The graduates blow out the flame together when they are declared graduates.

The graduation song is a vital part of the ceremony. It is considered a symbol of the graduating class and is usually chosen by the graduates, although in some cases the class adviser or the teachers may choose the song themselves. The graduates usually try to choose a song that will express their feelings about graduation.

Some songs have been chosen over and over as graduation songs and in many cases have defined a generation. The Diana Ross song “[[If We Hold On Together]]”, for example, became the graduation song in many Philippine schools in the early 1990s. Other songs that Filipino students have chosen to sing during their graduation rites are “Farewell” by Raymond Lauchengco, “The Journey” by [[Lea Salonga]], and “[[High School Life]]” by [[Sharon Cuneta]].

“[[Garland]]s” are essential to graduations in the [[Philippines]]. These are usually made from [[ribbon]], shaped into a lei and adorned with “flowers” made from the same material. Fresh flowers are never used for graduation garlands, except for everlasting flowers. Some people create special garlands by tying individually wrapped candies end to end; these are usually popular with kindergarten and elementary school graduates. Recently, garlands made of seashells have also been given at graduation rites.

Many [[high schools]] now place stands beside the stage and hang garlands on them. When the graduates exit the stage after getting their diplomas, lowerclassmen usually put garlands on each of them. After the recessional, family and friends also place garlands around the necks of the graduates. Some people also give graduation gifts during this time; however, garlands are de rigueur.

==South Africa==
At the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] (WITS), the graduation ceremonies are formal affairs, which include an academic procession by the faculty staff.  The WITS choir is always present, and as a fun twist once the academic procession has left the hall, the song "[[I Got You (I Feel Good)]]" by [[James Brown]] is played over the loudspeakers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Sweden==
In Sweden a high school graduation ceremony is celebrated as a tradition. The graduating students wear a [[student cap]] and celebrate the graduation ceremony. The students gather with their parents and well wishers, and rally on roads celebrating the high school graduation ceremony.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, unlike the United States, students do not usually 'graduate' from school below university level. They will normally leave [[secondary school]] or a [[sixth form college]] (if applicable) with specific qualifications, such as [[General Certificate of Education]] [[GCSE]]s and [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]]s, [[Scottish Qualification Authority]] [[Standard Grade]]s and [[Higher (Scottish)|Higher national courses]] or, less frequently, other certificates such as the [[International Baccalaureate]]. However, these are not usually presented in a formal ceremony.

Many university graduation ceremonies in the United Kingdom begin with a procession of academics, wearing [[academic dress]]. This procession is accompanied by music, and a [[ceremonial mace]] is often carried. After this, an official reads out the names of the graduates one by one, organized by class of degree and/or by subject. When their names are called, the graduates walk across the stage to shake hands with a senior official, often the university's [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] or the [[Chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]].  This may be followed by the conferring of an honorary doctorate to a highly accomplished guest where a citation is usually read by a member of staff of the relevant faculty/school/department.  Graduands wear the [[academic dress]] of the degree they are receiving.  A speech by the chancellor/vice-chancellor towards the graduates is delivered at the start or towards the end of the ceremony.  The actual degree certificate is typically not given to the graduand during the ceremony itself and is instead sent by post to the graduand's home address.

Some of the older universities may hold their graduation ceremonies in [[Latin]], even though few students understand this language. The Latin section of the ceremony may include a rendition of an [[anthem]], sometimes called the unofficial anthem of all universities, the [[De Brevitate Vitae]], also known as ''The Gaudeamus''. Member institutions of the [[University of Wales]] hold their graduation ceremonies almost entirely in the [[Welsh language]].

=== King's College London ===
[[File:King's College London graduands.JPG|thumb|[[King's College London]] graduands wearing [[Academic dress of King's College London|academic dresses]] without caps]]
At [[King's College London]], the graduands shake the hand of the university's President &amp; Principal (normally equivalent to a UK university's vice-chancellor). In addition, the hand of the Chairman of the King's College London Council, instead of its Chancellor (the senior official of [[University of London]]) is shaken. After being vested the power to award its own degrees from the [[University of London]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/governance/about/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; graduates since 2008 wear an [[Academic dress of King's College London|academic dress]] that does not feature a hat, designed by Dame [[Vivienne Westwood]].&lt;ref name="Westwood"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/publications/comment-archive/pdfs/2008/comment-183.pdf|title=Westwood unveils gowns|accessdate=24 June 2015 | location=London | first=Marion | last=Hume | date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the influence of the [[Academic dress of the University of London|University of London]]'s tradition, being the first university in the world to devise a system of academic dress based on faculty colours,&lt;ref&gt;Groves, N. et al. (2011). "[[George Shaw (academic dress scholar)|Shaw]]'s Academical Dress of Great Britain and Ireland". Burgon Society.&lt;/ref&gt; the gowns and hoods have been designed with colours that reflect the university's faculties/schools/institutes of study and the level of the degree.&lt;ref&gt;http://alumni.kcl.ac.uk/page.aspx?pid=792&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its unique shape, the hood cannot be folded flat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Groves classification system]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University of Oxford ===
At the [[University of Oxford]] graduands wear the dress of their status before graduating (their previous degree, or [[Academic dress of the University of Oxford#Undergraduates|undergraduate academic dress]]), afterwards changing into the dress of the degree they have just received. Serving members of the [[armed forces]] may wear their military [[uniform]] underneath.

=== University of Cambridge ===
{{main|University of Cambridge#Graduation}}
At the [[University of Cambridge]], graduands are presented in the Senate House college by college. During the graduation ceremony, officially called a ''Congregation'', graduands are brought forth by the Praelector of their college, who takes them by the right hand, and presents them to the vice-chancellor for the degree they are about to take. After presentation, the graduand is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree. The graduate then rises, bows, and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor's door into Senate House passage, where they receive their diploma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/degrees/ceremony/ |title=The University |publisher=Admin.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduands wear the academical dress to which they were entitled immediately before graduating, including the hood. If this dress does not itself include a hood (e.g. they are undergraduates becoming Bachelors of Arts), they wear the hood of the degree to which they are about to be admitted. Thus a Master of Arts (M.A.) about to become a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) wears the dress of an M.A. A graduate of another university who is not yet a Cambridge graduate wears a B.A. status (for those aged under 24) or M.A. status (24 or over) gown i.e. their previous academical dress, plus the hood of a Ph.D.

=== University of St Andrews ===
The degree ceremony at the [[University of St Andrews]] is conducted through a meeting of the [[Senatus Academicus]] in the Younger Hall, and dates back to the early antecedents of the University. The graduation is similar to many others, commencing with an academic procession (''juniores priores''/in reverse order of seniority) of the masters, [[principal (academia)|Principal]], the [[ceremonial mace|maces]], and [[Chancellor of the University of St Andrews|Chancellor]], during which the graduands and their guests sing [[De Brevitate Vitae|The Gaudeamus]]. Much of the ceremony is conducted in Latin. Once seated, the Prayer is read by the Dean of Divinity/Principal of [[St Mary's College, St Andrews|St Mary's College]]. After this graduands are called forward individually by the Dean of the Faculty within which they are a member (Arts, Divinity, Medicine, and Science). The graduand comes to the graduation desk before the Chancellor (or in his absence, the [[Principal of the University of St Andrews|Principal]], acting in the capacity of [[Vice-Chancellor]]), proffering the hood of the degree that they are about to receive to the [[Bedel]]lus, and kneels. The Chancellor then says:

:"''Te ad gradum Magistri Artium/Baccalaurei Scientiae/Baccalaurei Sacrosanctae Theologiae/Baccalaurei Scientiae Medicinae promoveo, cuius rei in symbolum super te hoc birretum impono.''"

("I promote you to the Degree of Master of Arts/Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Divinity/ Bachelor of Medical Science, as a symbol of which I place this cap upon you.")

Succeeding graduates to the same degree receive the formula "''Et super te"'' (and upon you also).
The [[Chancellor]] then touches the graduand's head with the graduation cap, and the Bedellus steps forth and places the hood of the degree to be conferred over the newly promoted graduate. The graduate then rises and bows to the Chancellor, and exits the stage to collect their diploma, before joining their fellow graduates in the main hall. 
Once the ceremony is complete the Benediction is read, again by the Dean of Divinity, and the academic procession leaves the hall ''seniores priores''/in order of seniority, with the new graduates joining the end as a sign of the accession to the academic community. The procession continues down North Street to the quadrangle of the [[United College, St Andrews|United College of St Salvator and St Leonard]], where it dissolves.

After each afternoon graduation, the [[General Council of the University of St Andrews|General Council]] hosts a garden party for the new graduates and their guests, usually on the Lower College Lawn.

=== The Open University ===

Due to the large number and geographical dispersion of students, unlike most UK universities, degree ceremonies at the Open University are not the occasion on which degrees are ''formally'' conferred. This happens ''in absentia'' at a joint meeting of the University's Council and Senate ("congregation") on an occasion prior to and entirely separate from the ceremony - it is not unusual for Open University graduates to attend their degree ceremony some months (or even years) after they have formally graduated. The University's ceremonies – or "Presentations of Graduates" – occur during the long summer throughout Britain and Ireland, as well as one ceremony in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/ceremonies |title=Ceremony Booking Information &amp;#124; Open University |publisher=Open.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States of America==
[[File:Cornell commencement 2008.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The 2008 commencement ceremony for [[Cornell University]]]]
In the [[United States]], besides "commencement," the term "graduation" is also used in schools below university level such as the high school, middle school and even kindergarten and preschool ceremonies.

The [[American Council on Education]] (ACE) is the authority on [[academic dress|academic regalia]] in the US, and has developed an Academic Ceremony Guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=22417#Ceremony |title=ACE &amp;#124; Academic Costume Code &amp; Ceremony Guide |publisher=Acenet.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309044543/http://www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=22417#Ceremony |archive-date=2010-03-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is generally followed by most institutions of higher learning. The ceremony guide and the related ''Academic Costume Code'' provide the core of academic ceremony traditions in the US.  The ACE code addresses college and university dress: high school and other lower school gown colors vary from institution to institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhymeuniversity.com/Elementary_Middle_High_School_Graduation_Gown_Sets%7cp113_c48_o0.html |title=Middle School Graduation Caps &amp; Gowns &amp;#124; High School Graduation Caps &amp; Gowns &amp;#124; |publisher=Rhymeuniversity.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At many large US institutions, where many hundreds of degrees are being granted at once, the main ceremony (commencement) involving all graduates in a [[sports stadium]], [[amphitheater]], parade ground or lawn, or other large – often outdoor – venue is usually followed, but sometimes preceded, by smaller ceremonies (''diploma ceremony'') at sites on or around campus where [[Dean (education)|deans]] and faculty of each academic organization ([[college]], [[academic department]], program, etc.) distribute diplomas to their graduates.

Another means of handling very large numbers of graduates is to have several ceremonies, divided by field of study, at a central site over the course of a weekend instead of one single ceremony. At large institutions the great number of family members and guests that each graduating student wishes to attend may exceed the capacity of organizers to accommodate. Universities try to manage this by allocating a specified number of graduation tickets to each student that will be graduating.

[[File:AFA Graduates.jpg|thumb|250px|Traditional hat toss celebration at a graduation ceremony at the [[United States Air Force Academy]]]]
At most colleges and universities in the US, a faculty member or dean will ceremoniously recommend that each class of candidates (often by college but sometimes by program/major) be awarded the proper degree, which is then formally and officially conferred by the president or other institutional official. Typically, this is accomplished by a pair of short set speeches by a senior academic official and a senior institutional official:
:"Mr. President, on behalf of the faculty of Letters and Science, I hereby declare that these candidates have met all the requirements for the degree of ... and request that such degree be conferred upon them."  "Under the authority vested in me by the State of (?) and the Trustees of ? College, I hereby confer upon these candidates the degree of ..."

For students receiving an advanced degree, many colleges include a '''Hooding Ceremony''' in their commencement program, in which the students wear a [[Academic regalia in the United States#Hoods|hood]].  Candidates traditionally have the hood placed upon them at the podium, though this has become less practical at large commencement ceremonies.  At [[Fordham University]], graduates of a college put on the hood by themselves ''[[en masse]]'' after the university president confers the degree upon them from the podium. This is called 'to self-hood'. Doctorates are nearly universally hooded upon the stage.

The [[Academic regalia in the United States#Hoods|hood]] is a part of traditional [[Academic regalia in the United States#History|academic dress]] whose origins date back many centuries. Today, the hood is considered by some to be the most expressive component of the academic costume. Today’s hoods have evolved from a practical garment to a symbolic one.
An academic hood is a symbolic garment, which is worn draped around the neck and over the shoulders, displayed down the back with the lining exposed. The hood’s length signifies the degree level; with the institution's colors in the lining and a velvet trim in a [[Academic regalia in the United States#Intercollegiate colors|standardized color that signifies the scholar’s field]].

===Graduation speech===

{{main|Commencement speech}}
[[File:UNHGrad.jpg|thumb|[[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] at the [[University of New Hampshire]]'s 2007 commencement]]
A graduation or [[commencement speech]], in the U.S., is a public speech given by a student or by alumnus of a university to a graduating class and their guests. Common themes of the graduation speech include wishing the graduates well in the "real world", cautioning that the world of academe is a special place where they were taught to think (a common variation contradicts this view). More recently, the trend has been to find a celebrity or a politician to deliver the speech.

Notable exceptions are [[Columbia University]],  [[Davidson College]], and [[Belmont University]], where the tradition has been that only the current university president gives the commencement address. Though there is only one commencement, individual colleges and schools of Columbia often invite a speaker at separate graduation ceremonies held earlier or on another day, however.

===Special graduation ceremonies===

Many [[Homeschooling in the United States|homeschooling]] groups hold their own graduation ceremonies, as it is uncommon (and often not permitted) for homeschool graduates to participate in their local school district's official graduation ceremony. Some GED testing centers hold graduation ceremonies for those who take the [[General Educational Development|GED]] and pass.

The parents and students of the class of 2009 in [[Centerburg, Ohio]] held their own unofficial graduation ceremony at the local park when the school board decided to cancel the official graduation ceremony, in response to a cheating scandal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2009/jun/07/seniors_hold_graduation_after_board_cancels_ceremo-ar-14107/ |title=Seniors Hold Graduation After Board Cancels Ceremony |publisher=NBC 4i |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009004200/http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2009/jun/07/seniors_hold_graduation_after_board_cancels_ceremo-ar-14107/ |archivedate=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though only one person out of the entire 97-student graduating class was ever proven guilty of cheating. The school board's response was criticized by most media outlets in [[Ohio]] and even gained nationwide media coverage in the [[United States]]. The parents' and students' decision to hold their own graduation ceremony was cheered by many local businesses, and received mixed views, mostly through later letters to the editor of the ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]'' and other newspapers in the area.

=== Behaviour and decorum issues ===

It is common for graduates not to receive their actual diploma at the ceremony but instead a certificate indicating that they participated in the ceremony or a portfolio to hold the diploma in. At the [[high school]] level, this allows [[academic administrator]]s to withhold diplomas from students who are unruly during the ceremony, or whose friends and family disrupt the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott Wegener, swegener@wcpo.com |url=http://www.wcpo.com/dpp/news/local_news/popular-senior-denied-diploma-because-of-too-much-cheering |title=Popular senior denied diploma because of too much cheering - Story |publisher=Wcpo.com |date=2012-06-04 |accessdate=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools have banned the sounding of [[Megaphone|bull horns]] by the relatives of graduating students.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/south-carolina-mom-arrested-cheering-loudly-daughter-graduation-article-1.1090056 |title=Mom arrested for cheering too loudly at daughter’s graduation |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2012-06-05 |accessdate=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High schools often inform guests at the start of a graduation ceremony that cheering for individual students should be reserved until all the student's names have been read, and their certificates collected.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;

At the [[college]] level, this allows students who need an additional [[academic term|quarter]] or [[academic term|semester]] to satisfy their academic requirements to nevertheless participate in the official ceremony with their [[generational cohort|cohort]] before receiving their degree. In addition, with large numbers of students receiving diplomas and often no specific order they walk in, it is impossible for their actual diplomas to be given to them at the ceremony, thus them receiving simply a blank diploma to be filled later.

===Graduation parties===
People often throw graduation parties to celebrate the event. These parties can be more general ones, or they can also be themed. Games can be present, as well as music.&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web | url = http://www.minicassia.com/online_features/food_recipes_entertaining/article_9cd7bad3-8125-53d4-9d61-a9d4a82692ce.html | title = 5 tips for a memorable, stress-free graduation party | work = Weekly Mailer | date = April 30, 2018 | accessdate = April 30, 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Flower leis can also be incorporated into celebrations for graduating students, particularly in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-graduation-lei-20150619-story.html | title = Florists are increasingly in lei-away mode during graduation season | work = LA Times | last = Masunaga | first = Samantha | date = June 18, 2015 | accessdate = April 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://alohaislandlei.com/info/flower-leis-perfect-graduation/ | title = Why Flower Leis Are Perfect For Graduation | work = Aloha Island Lei | date = April 9, 2018 | accessdate = April 30, 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Parties can also have a food truck rented out for them.&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web | url = http://www.postbulletin.com/news/columns/jen-s-world-graduation-parties-have-changed-since/article_05ef38f2-473b-11e8-85fe-cb4c8ead632f.html | title =  Jen's World: Graduation parties have changed since 1990 | work = Post Bulletin | last = Koski | first = Jennifer | date = April 25, 2018 | accessdate = April 30, 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''birthday effect''' (sometimes called the '''birthday blues''', especially when referring specifically to [[suicide]]) is a statistical phenomenon where an individual's likelihood of death appears to increase on or close to their [[birthday]]. The birthday effect has been seen in studies of general populations in [[England and Wales]],&lt;ref name="E&amp;W"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Relationship between month of birth and month of death in the elderly|first1=M|last1=Anderson|journal=British Journal of Preventive &amp; Social Medicine|year=1975|volume=29|issue=3|pages=151–156|pmc=478908|pmid=1191883}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref name="Swiss1992"&gt;{{cite journal|title=[Mortality and birthdays]|first1=J|last1=Bovet|first2=J|last2=Spagnoli|first3=C|last3=Sudan|journal=Sozial-und Praventivmedizin|year=1997|volume=42|issue=3|pages=151–161|pmid=9334087|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swiss2008"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Death has a preference for birthdays—an analysis of death time series|first1=Vladeta|last1=Ajdacic-Gross|display-authors=etal|journal=Annals of Epidemiology|year=2012|volume=22|issue=8|pages=603–606|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104727971200110X|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2012.04.016|pmid=22658822}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref name="Ukraine"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Variation of mortality rate during the individual annual cycle|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9087987|first1=Alexander|last1=Vaiserman|first2=Pavel|last2=Grigoryev|first3=Irina|last3=Belaya|first4=Vladimir|last4=Voitenko|journal=Biogerontology|year=2003|volume=4|issue=4|pages=221–225|doi=10.1023/A:1025168932058}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="California"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Birthday: Lifeline or Deadline?|first1=David|last1=Phillips|first2=Camilla|last2=Van Voorhees|first3=Todd|last3=Ruth|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=1992|volume=54|issue=5|pages=532–542|url=http://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/1992/09000/The_birthday__lifeline_or_deadline__.1.aspx|doi=10.1097/00006842-199209000-00001|citeseerx=10.1.1.103.5726}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A not so happy day after all: Excess death rates on birthdays in the U.S|first1=Pablo|last1=Peña|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2015|volume=126|pages=59–66|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614008120|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.12.014|pmid=25528555}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in smaller populations such as [[Major League Baseball]] players.&lt;ref name="MLB"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mortality Salience of Birthdays on Day of Death in the Major Leagues|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=Death Studies|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=175–184|doi=10.1080/07481180802138936|pmid=19143110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies do not consistently show this effect; some studies find that men's and women's mortality rates diverge in the run-up to the birthday,&lt;ref name="California"/&gt; while others find no [[statistical significance|significant]] gender effect.&lt;ref name="Austria"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Longevity and month of birth: Evidence from Austria and Denmark|first1=Gabrielle|last1=Doblhammer|journal=Demographic Research|year=1999|volume=1|issue=3|url=http://www.demographic-research.org/Volumes/Vol1/3/default.htm|doi=10.4054/DemRes.1999.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Germany"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deaths and major biographical events: a study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009|first1=Daniel|last1=Medenwald|first2=Oliver|last2=Kuss|journal=BMJ Open|year=2014|volume=4|issue=4|url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/4/e004423.long|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004423|pmid=24694623|pmc=3987729|pages=e004423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested mechanisms for the effect include alcohol consumption, psychological stress relating to the birthday, increased suicide risk, terminally ill patients attempting to hold on until their birthday, an increased [[mortality salience]], or a physiological cycle that causes the body to weaken annually. It has also been suggested that it may be a statistical artifact, perhaps as a result of anomalies in reporting, but the birthday effect has also been seen in studies that control for known reporting anomalies.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt;

==Studies==
[[File:GabbyHartnettGoudeycard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gabby Hartnett]] is one of the statistically unusual number of [[MLB]] players to have died on his birthday.&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt;]]
With the introduction of statistical software that can process large datasets easily, a number of state- or country-wide studies have been carried out to investigate whether birthdays have any effect on mortality. The first large-scale study used the records of 2,745,149 Californians who died between 1969 and 1990. After correcting for confounding factors such as [[seasonality]] in deaths, elective surgery, and people born on [[February 29]], there was a significant increase in deaths in the week before the individual's birthday for men, and in the week after the birthday for women – in both cases, mortality did not peak on the birthday, but close to it. This effect was consistent across age and race cohorts.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

A similar study among 12,275,033 Swiss found the highest mortality on the actual birthday (17% greater than the expected value), and the effect was largest for those over 80;&lt;ref name="Swiss1992"/&gt; another study on Swiss data found a 13.8% excess and was able to link this to specific causes: [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]] (predominant in women) and suicides and accidents (predominant in men), as well as an increase in cancer deaths.&lt;ref name="Swiss2008"/&gt; Among 25 million Americans who died between 1998 and 2011, 6.7% more people than expected die on their birthday, and the effect was most pronounced at weekends and among the young – among 20 to 29 year olds, the excess was over 25%.&lt;ref name="USA"/&gt; An even greater excess was found in the population of Kiev, where between 1990 and 2000 there were 44.4% more deaths than expected among men on their birthdays and 36.2% more than expected among women.&lt;ref name="Ukraine"/&gt; Smaller biographical studies have also shown a birthday effect within subpopulations, such as among Major League Baseball (MLB) players&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt; and people with entries in the ''Encyclopedia of American History''.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

Focusing on suicide deaths alone, large studies have found evidence for a peak in suicides on or just after a birthday in [[Denmark]]&lt;ref name="Denmark"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Postponed Suicide Death? Suicides around Birthdays and Major Public Holidays|first1=Gert|last1=Jessen|first2=Børge|last2=Jensen|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|year=1999|volume=29|issue=3|pages=272–283|doi=10.1111/j.1943-278X.1999.tb00302.x|doi-broken-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hungary]],&lt;ref name="Hungary"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Birthday on the Fluctuation of Suicides in Hungary (1970–2002)|first1=Tamás|last1=Zonda|first2=Károly|last2=Bozsonyi|first3=Előd|last3=Veres|first4=Zoltán|last4=Kmetty|journal=Review of Sociology|year=2010|volume=20|issue=2|pages=96–105|url=http://www.szociologia.hu/dynamic/revsoc_2010_2_96_105_bozsonyi.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not in [[Bavaria]]&lt;ref name="Bavaria"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The myth of the birthday blues: a population-based study about the association between birthday and suicide|first1=Udo|last1=Reulbach|first2=Teresa|last2=Biermann|first3=Katrin|last3=Markovic|first4=Johannes|last4=Kornhuber|first5=Stefan|last5=Bleich|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|year=2007|volume=48|issue=6|pages=554–557|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X07000867|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2007.06.006|pmid=17954141}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="Bavaria"/&gt;

However, other studies have not found such a correlation. A study using the populations of Denmark and [[Austria]] (a total of 2,052,680 deaths over the time period) found that although people's life span tended to correlate with their month of birth, there was no consistent birthday effect, and people born in autumn or winter were more likely to die in the months further from their birthday.&lt;ref name="Austria"/&gt; A study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009 found no evidence of a birthday effect, although it did find a related Christmas effect.&lt;ref name="Germany"/&gt; A small study by [[Leonard Zusne]] found birthday effects among both male and female cohorts, where women were more likely to die immediately before a birthday and men more likely to die immediately after, but that when averaged together there was no birthday effect among the population as a whole.&lt;ref name="Zusne"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Some Factors Affecting the Birthday-Deathday Phenomenon|first1=Leonard|last1=Zusne|journal=Omega: Journal of Death and Dying|year=1987|volume=17|issue=1|pages=9–26|url=http://ome.sagepub.com/content/17/1/9.short|doi=10.2190/RR4D-4W0L-5QAK-X4YX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same was found for a study of mortality data in England and Wales, where there was a statistically significant birthday effect among each subgroup (men and women; never married, married, divorced and widowed) but [[Simpson's paradox|it was not seen in the population as a whole]].&lt;ref name="E&amp;W"/&gt;

==Possible explanations==

===External causes===
Birthday celebrations are often associated with large increases in alcohol consumption. [[Binge drinking]] can [[Alcohol and health|increase an individual's risk of death]] through [[alcohol poisoning]], accidents and [[drunk driving]], as well as by exacerbating existing conditions and increasing suicide risk.&lt;ref name="Ukraine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hungary"/&gt; In the USA where the drinking age is 21, there is a very large mortality rate excess on the 21st birthday and the day immediately following, almost entirely attributable to an increase in accidents.&lt;ref name="alcohol"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Mortality: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from the Minimum Drinking Age|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date=1 January 2009|volume=1|issue=1)|pages=164–182|first1=Christopher|last1=Carpenter|first2=Carlos|last2=Dobkin|doi=10.1257/app.1.1.164|pmid=20351794|pmc=2846371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alcoholappendix"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Mortality: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from the Minimum Drinking Age (Web Appendix A and B)|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date=1 January 2009|first1=Christopher|last1=Carpenter|first2=Carlos|last2=Dobkin|url=https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/articles-attachments/aej/app/app/2007-0089_app.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychosomatic and psychological===
{{see also|Mortality salience}}
Two mutually contradictory explanations have been put forward that rely on [[psychosomatic]] effects. On the one hand, a birthday provides a fixed date to focus on, allowing the terminally ill to hold on until the day itself. On the other hand, a birthday also reminds the individual of mortality and offers an occasion to look back on life.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/22/news/birthdays-a-matter-of-life-and-death.html|first1=Sandra|last1=Blakeslee|title=Birthdays: a Matter Of Life and Death|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 September 1992|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[terror management theory]], this causes stress which can accelerate death. The uneven mortality rate distribution between men and women, and between more and less successful baseball players, suggests that both may play a role in the birthday effect: people who have focused on the [[public sphere]] of life (for example, [[career]]-driven people or professional athletes) might be reminded that their glory days have passed, while those who lived more in the [[private sphere]] (such as stay-at-home parents and amateur sports players) are more aware of what they will lose in death and try to hold on.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Related is the "broken promise effect", whereby a person suffering [[suicidal ideation]] will wait until a birthday or other significant event to see whether their circumstances will improve.&lt;ref name="Hungary"/&gt;

The psychosomatic/psychological model would also explain the similar increase in cancer deaths around holidays such as [[Christmas]],&lt;ref name="Germany"/&gt; and is supported by the fact that these appear to be dependent on culture – there is a [[Passover]] effect among the Jewish community (which moves [[Passover#Date and duration|with the festival itself]]), and a [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] effect among the Chinese.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

===Physiological===
It has been suggested that, like the 24-hour [[circadian rhythm]], the body also has a yearly "circannual" [[biological rhythm]]. Vaiserman et al. have suggested that the climatic conditions at birth act as a [[zeitgeber]] that triggers internal stress and increases the chance of death.&lt;ref name="Ukraine"/&gt;

===Statistical===
It is possible when processing [[death certificate]]s to confuse the date of birth and date of death fields, which would increase the apparent number of certificates in which these coincide.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt; Additionally, where the exact date is not known, the 1st and 15th of the month are often used as placeholders.&lt;ref name="Heaping"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Heaping in Anniversary Reaction Studies: A Cautionary Note|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=Omega: Journal of Death and Dying|year=2006|volume=54|issue=1|pages=59–65|url=http://ome.sagepub.com/content/54/1/59.short|doi=10.2190/V752-6773-1KMW-3334}}&lt;/ref&gt; These will cause an excess of births and deaths recorded on these dates. However studies also find changes in the mortality rate in the days immediately before and after (which are unlikely to be caused by data processing anomalies), which suggests that statistical artifacts alone cannot explain the birthday effect.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Between '''780–1180''', the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Abbasid]] &amp; [[Fatimid]] [[caliphate]]s in the regions of [[Iraq]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Syria]], [[Anatolia]] and [[Southern Italy]] fought a series of wars for supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean. After a period of indecisive and slow border warfare, a string of almost unbroken Byzantine victories in the late 10th and early 11th centuries allowed three Byzantine Emperors, namely [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros II Phocas]], [[John I Tzimiskes]] and finally [[Basil II]] to recapture territory lost to the [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century '''[[Byzantine-Arab Wars]]''' under the failing [[Byzantium under the Heraclians|Heraclian Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Paul180"&gt;{{cite book|last=Magdalino|first=Paul|title=The Oxford History of Byzantium|location=New York|publisher= Oxford UP|year=2002|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, large parts of Syria,&lt;ref name="Paul180"/&gt; excluding its capital city of [[Damascus]], were taken by the Byzantines, even if only for a few years, with a new theme of Syria integrated into the expanding empire. In addition to the natural gains of land, and wealth and manpower received from these victories, the Byzantines also inflicted a psychological defeat on their opponents by recapturing territory deemed holy and important to [[Christendom]], in particular the city of [[Antioch]]&amp;mdash;allowing Byzantium to hold two of Christendoms' five most important [[Patriarchs]], those making up the [[Pentarchy]].&lt;ref name="Norwich192"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nonetheless, the Arabs remained a fierce opponent to the Byzantines and a temporary [[Fatimid]] recovery after ''c.'' 970 had the potential to reverse many of the earlier victories.&lt;ref name="Norwich202"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; And while Byzantium took large parts of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jerusalem]] was left untouched and the ideological victory from the campaign was not as great as it could have been had Byzantium recaptured this fourth Patriarchal seat of Christendom. Byzantine attempts to stem the slow but successful Arab conquest of [[Sicily]] ended in a dismal failure.&lt;ref name="Norwich221"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Syria would cease to exist as a Byzantine province when the Turks took the city of Antioch in ''c''. 1084. The Crusaders took the city back for Christendom in 1097 but a Byzantine protectorate was established over the [[Crusades|Crusader]] Kingdoms in Jerusalem and Antioch under Manuel I Komnenos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magdalino|first=Paul|title=The Oxford History of Byzantium|location=New York|publisher= Oxford UP|year=2002|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Manuel Komnenos in 1180 terminated military campaigns far from Constantinople and after the [[Fourth Crusade]] both the Byzantines and the Arabs were engaged in other conflicts until they were conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, respectively.

==Background, 630–780==
In&amp;nbsp;629, conflict between Byzantine Empire and Arabs started when both parties confronted in the [[Battle of Mu'tah]]. Having recently converted to Islam and unified by the Islamic Prophet's call for a ''[[Jihad]]'' (struggle) against the Byzantine and Persian Empires, they rapidly advanced and took advantage of the chaos of the Byzantine Empire, which had not fully consolidated its re-acquisitions from the Persian invasions in c.&amp;nbsp;620. By 642, the Empire had lost Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Treadgold|first=Warren|title=The Oxford History of Byzantium|location=New York|publisher= Oxford UP|year=2002|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having lost two-thirds of its land and resources (most of all the grain supply of Egypt) the Empire nonetheless retained 80,000 troops, thanks to the efficiency of the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|Thema system]] and a reformed [[Byzantine economy]] aimed at supplying the army with weapons and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Treadgold|first=Warren|title=The Oxford History of Byzantium|location=New York|publisher= Oxford UP|year=2002|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these reforms, the Byzantines were able to inflict a number of defeats against the Arabs; twice at Constantinople in [[Siege of Constantinople (674)|674]] and [[Siege of Constantinople (717)|717]] and at Akroinon in [[Battle of Akroinon|740]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Treadgold|first=Warren|title=The Oxford History of Byzantium|location=New York|publisher= Oxford UP|year=2002|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine V, the son of Leo III (who had led Byzantium to victory in 717 and 740) continued the successes of his father by launching a successful offensive that captured [[Theodosioupolis]] and [[Melitene]]. Nonetheless, these conquests were temporary; the Iconoclasm controversy, the ineffective rule of Irene and her successors coupled with the resurrection of the [[Western Roman Empire]] under the Frankish [[Carolingian Empire]] and Bulgarian invasions meant that the Byzantines were on the defensive again.

== Period of 780–842 ==

===Michael II vs Caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]]===
Between 780 and 824, the Arabs and the Byzantines were settled down into border skirmishing, with Arab raids into [[Anatolia]] replied in kind by Byzantine raids that "stole" Christian subjects of the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliphate]] and forcibly settled them into the Anatolian farmlands to increase the population (and hence provide more farmers and more soldiers). The situation changed however with the rise to power of [[Michael II]] in 820. Forced to deal with the rebel [[Thomas the Slav]], Michael had few troops to spare against a small Arab invasion of 40 ships and 10,000 men against [[Crete]], which fell in 824.&lt;ref name="Magdalino171"&gt;{{cite book|last=Magdalino|first=Paul|title=The Oxford History of Byzantium|location=New York|publisher= Oxford UP|year=2002|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Byzantine counter in 826 failed miserably. Worse still was the invasion of [[Sicily]] in 827 by Arabs of Tunis.&lt;ref name="Magdalino171"/&gt; Even so, Byzantine resistance in Sicily was fierce and not without success whilst the Arabs became quickly plagued by the cancer of the Caliphate&amp;mdash; internal squabbles. That year, the Arabs were expelled from [[Sicily]] but they were to return.

===Theophilos vs Caliphs [[Al-Ma'mun]] and [[Al-Mu'tasim]]===
In 829, Michael II died and was succeeded by his son [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]]. Theophilos received a mixed diet of success and defeat against his Arab opponents. In 830 AD the Arabs returned to Sicily and after a year-long siege took [[Palermo]] from their Christian opponents and for the next 200 years they were to remain there to complete their conquest, which was never short of Christian counters.&lt;ref name="Norwich134"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbasids meanwhile launched an invasion of Anatolia in 830 AD. [[Al-Ma'mun]] triumphed and a number of Byzantine forts were lost. Theophilos did not relent and in 831 captured Tarsus from the Muslims.&lt;ref name="Norwich137"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defeat followed victory, with two Byzantine defeats in [[Cappadocia]] followed by the destruction of [[Malatya|Melitene]], [[Samosata]] and Zapetra by vengeful Byzantine troops in 837. [[Al-Mu'tasim]] however gained the upper hand with his 838  victories at [[Battle of Dazimon|Dazimon]], [[Ancyra]] and finally at [[Sack of Amorium|Amorium]]&lt;ref name="Norwich137"/&gt;&amp;mdash;the sack of the latter is presumed to have caused great grief for Theophilos and was one of the factors of his death in 842.

==Campaigns of Michael III, 842–867==
[[Michael III]] was only two years of age when his father died. His mother, the Empress [[Theodora II|Theodora]] took over as regent. After the regency had finally removed [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|Iconoclasm]], war with the Saracens resumed. Although an expedition to recover Crete failed in 853, the Byzantine scored three major success in 853 and 855. A Byzantine fleet sailed unopposed in [[Damietta]] and set fire to all the ships in the harbour, returning with many prisoners.&lt;ref name="Norwich140"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Better still for Constantinople was the [[Battle of Lalakaon|desperate and futile defense]] by the Emir of Melitene, whose realm was lost by the Arabs forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insult was added to injury for the Arabs when the Arab governor of Armenia began losing control of his domain. After the 9th century, the Arabs would never be in a dominant position in the East. 

In the West however, things went the Saracen way; Messina and Enna fell in 842 and 859 whilst Islamic success in [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]] encouraged the warriors of the ''Jihad'' to take Bari in 847, establishing the [[Emirate of Bari]] which would last to 871. In [[History of Islam in southern Italy|invading southern Italy]], the Arabs attracted the attention of the Frankish powers north.

Michael III decided to remedy the situation by first taking back Crete from the Arabs. The island would provide an excellent base for operations in southern Italy and Sicily or at the least a supply base to allow the still resisting Byzantine troops to hold out. In 865 [[Bardas]], maternal uncle to Michael III and one of the most prominent members of his regency, was set to launch an invasion when a potential plot against his wife by [[Basil I]] and Michael III (the former being the future emperor and favorite of the latter) was discovered. Thus Islamic Crete was spared from an invasion by Byzantium's greatest general at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns of Basil I and Leo VI, 867–912==
[[File:Byzantine-Arab Wars in southern Italy.PNG|thumb|right|Unlike Sicily, the Byzantines never lost a hold on southern Italy. By the time of Basil I, the Empire had secured its grip, though Arab attacks and temporary conquests would continue into Basil II's reign]]

===Basil I===

Like his murdered predecessor, the reign of [[Basil I]] saw a mixture of defeat and victory against the Arabs. Byzantine success in the [[Euphrates]] valley in the East was complemented with successes in the west where the Saracens were driven out of the [[Dalmatia]]n coast in 873 and [[Bari]] fell to the Byzantines in 876.&lt;ref name="Norwich155"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] fell in 878 to the [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicilian Emirate]] and without further help Byzantine Sicily seemed lost.&lt;ref name="Norwich155"/&gt;  In 880 [[Taranto]] and much of [[Calabria]] fell to Imperial troops. Calabria had been Rome's pre-[[Aegyptus]] bread basket, so this was more than just a propaganda victory.

===Leo VI===
Basil I died in 886, convinced that the future [[Leo VI the Wise]] was actually his illegitimate son by his mistress [[Eudokia Ingerina]].  The reign of Leo VI rendered poor results against the Arabs. The savage sack of [[History of Thessaloniki|Thessalonika]] in 904 by the [[Saracens]] of [[Emirate of Crete|Crete]] was avenged when a Byzantine army and fleet smashed its way towards [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] and left the port, as important to the Arabs as Thessalonika was to Byzantium, in ashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other notable events included the loss of [[Taormina]] in 902 and a six-month siege of Crete. The expedition departed when news of the Emperor's death reached [[Himerios (admiral)|Himerios]], commander of the expedition, and then it was almost completely destroyed (Himerios escaped) not far from Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanos I and Constantine VII, 920–959==
Until this time, the Byzantine Empire had been concerned solely with survival and with holding on to what they already had. Numerous expeditions to Crete and Sicily were sadly reminiscent of the failures of [[Heraclius]], even though the Arab conquest of Sicily did not go according to plan. After Leo's death in 912 the Empire became embroiled in problems with the regency of the seven-year-old [[Constantine VII]] and with invasions of [[Thrace]] by [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|pp=168–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arab campaigns in Sicily2.PNG|thumb|left|Arab conquest of Sicily. Byzantine reinforcements were few, and operations were primarily defensive in nature. The loss of Crete and the Arab capture of Calabria forced Constantine VII to pay tribute.]]

The situation changed however when the admiral [[Romanos Lekapenos]] assumed power as a co-emperor with three of his rather useless sons and Constantine VII, thus ending the internal problems with the government. Meanwhile, the Bulgar problem more or less solved itself with the death of Simeon in 927, so Byzantine general [[John Kourkouas]] was able to campaign aggressively against the Saracens from 923 to about 950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia was consolidated within the Empire whilst Melitene, which had been a ruined emirate since the 9th century, was annexed at last. In 941 John Kourkouas was forced to turn his army north to fight off the invasion of [[Igor I of Kiev]], but he was able to return to lay siege to [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]&amp;mdash;no Byzantine army had reached as far since the days of Heraclius. In the end the city was able to maintain its freedom when [[Al-Muttaqi]] agreed to give up a precious Christian relic: the "[[Image of Edessa]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine VII assumed full power in 945. Whilst his predecessor, Romanos I had managed to use diplomacy to keep peace in the West against the [[Bulgars]], the East required the force of arms to achieve peace. Constantine VII turned to his most powerful ally, the Phocas family. [[Bardas Phokas the Elder]] had originally supported the claims of Constantine VII against those of Romanos I, and his position as ''[[strategos]]'' of the [[Armeniakon]] [[Theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|Theme]] made him the ideal candidate for war against the Caliphate.&lt;ref name="Norwich181"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Bardas was wounded in 953 without much success, though his son Nikephoros Phokas was able to inflict a serious defeat on the Caliphate: [[Hadath|Adata]] fell in 957 whilst Nikephoros' young nephew, John Tzimiskes, captured [[Samosata]] in the Euphrates valley in 958.&lt;ref name="Norwich181"/&gt;

==Romanos II, 959–963==
[[Romanos II]] launched the largest expedition by Byzantium since the days of Heraclius. A mammoth force of 50,000 men, 1,000 heavy transports, over 300 supply ships, and some 2,000 [[Greek Fire|Greek Fire Ships]] under the brilliant [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]] set sail for [[Heraklion|Candia]], the Islamic capital of Crete.&lt;ref name="Norwich184"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an eight-month siege and a bitter winter,&lt;ref name="Norwich184"/&gt; Nikephoros sacked the city. News of the reconquest was met with great delight in Constantinople with a night-long service of thanksgiving was given by the Byzantines in the [[Hagia Sophia]].&lt;ref name="Norwich185"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nikephoros saw none of this gratitude, denied a triumph due to Romanus II's fear of feeding his ambitions.&lt;ref name="Norwich185" /&gt; Instead, Nikephoros had to march rapidly to the East where [[Saif al-Daula]] of the [[Hamdanid dynasty]], the [[Emir of Aleppo]], had taken 30,000 men into Imperial territory,&lt;ref name="Norwich185"/&gt; attempting to take advantage of the army's absence in Crete. The Emir was one of the most powerful independent rulers in the Islamic world&amp;mdash;his domains included [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]], [[Emesa]], and [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Norwich185"/&gt; After a triumphant campaign, Saif was bogged down with overwhelming numbers of prisoners and loot. [[Leo Phokas the Younger|Leo Phokas]], brother of Nikephoros, was unable to engage the Emir in an open battle with his small army. Instead, Saif found himself fleeing from battle with 300 cavalry and his army torn to pieces by a brilliantly planned ambush in the mountain passes of Asia Minor. With great satisfaction, Christian captives were substituted with recently acquired Muslims.&lt;ref name="Norwich186" /&gt;

When Nikephoros arrived and linked up with his brother, their army did no few wonders&amp;mdash;a few weeks into 962, some 55 walled towns in [[Cilicia]] were returned to Imperial control.&lt;ref name="Norwich186"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not many months later, the Phokas brothers were beneath the walls of Aleppo. The Byzantines stormed the city on December 23 destroying all but the citadel that was zealously held by a few soldiers of the Emir. Nikephoros ordered a withdrawal; the Emir of Aleppo was badly beaten and would no longer pose a threat.&lt;ref name="Norwich186" /&gt; The troops still holding out at the citadel were ignored with contempt. News of the death of Romanos II reached Nikephoros before he had left [[Cappadocia]].

==Byzantine resurgence, 963–1025==

===Nikephoros II Phocas, 963–969===
[[File:Nikiphoros Phokas.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Emperor Nikephoros]]

Romanos II left behind [[Theophano (10th century)|Theophano]], a beautiful empress widow, and four children, the eldest son being less than seven years. Like many regencies, that of [[Basil II]] proved chaotic and not without scheming of ambitious generals, such as Nikephoros, or internal fighting between Macedonian levies, [[Anatolians]], and even the pious crowd of the [[Hagia Sophia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|pp=187–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Nikephoros emerged triumphant in 963, he once more began campaigning against his Saracen opponents in the East. 

In 965 [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] fell after a series of repeated Byzantine campaigns in Cilicia, followed by [[Cyprus]] that same year.&lt;ref name="Norwich192"/&gt; In 967 the defeated Saif of Mosul died of a stroke,&lt;ref name="Norwich192"/&gt; depriving Nikephoros of his only serious challenge there. Said had not fully recovered from the sack of Aleppo, which became an imperial vassal shortly thereafter. In 969, the city of [[Antioch]] was retaken by the Byzantines,&lt;ref name="Norwich192"/&gt; the first major city in Syria to be lost by the Arabs. Byzantine success was not total; in 964 another failed attempt was made to take Sicily by sending an army led by an illegitimate nephew of Nikephoros, Manuel Phokas. In 969, Nikephoros was murdered in his palace by John Tzimiskes, who took the throne for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John I Tzimiskes, 969–976===
In 971 the new [[Fatimid]] Caliphate entered the scene. With newly found zeal, the Fatimids took [[History of Arab Egypt|Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and much of [[Syria]] from the powerless Abbasids, who were beginning to have their own Turkic problems.&lt;ref name="Norwich202" /&gt; Having defeated their Islamic opponents, the Fatimids saw no reason to stop at Antioch and Aleppo, cities in the hands of the Christian Byzantines, making their conquest more important. A failed attack on Antioch in 971 was followed up by a Byzantine defeat outside of Amida.&lt;ref name="Norwich202"/&gt; However, [[John I Tzimiskes]] would prove to be a greater foe than Nikephoros. With 10,000 Armenian troops and other levies he pushed south, relieving the Imperial possessions there and threatening [[Baghdad]] with an [[invasion]]. His reluctance to invade the Abbasid Capital, though poorly defended and demoralized, remains a mystery.&lt;ref name="Norwich202"/&gt;

After dealing with more Church matters, Tzimiskes returned in the Spring of 975. The Umayyad conquests had been halted after roughly a hundred years, but Tzimiskes cut the initial success of the Fatimid Caliphate even sooner: Syria, [[Lebanon]], and much of Palestine fell to the imperial armies of Byzantium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that Tzimiskes grew ill that year and the year after, halting his progress and sparing [[Jerusalem]] from a Christian victory.

===Basil II Porphyrogennitus, 976–1025===
[[File:Byzantine-Arab Wars. Emphasis on the East.PNG|250px|thumb|Map of major conflicts between the Byzantines and the Arabs in the East]]

The early reign of [[Basil II]] was distracted with civil wars across the Empire. After dealing with the invasions of [[Samuel of Bulgaria]] and the revolts of [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phokas]] and [[Bardas Skleros]], Basil turned his attention in 995 to Syria, where the Emir of Aleppo was in danger.&lt;ref name="Norwich212"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an imperial vassal the Emir pleaded to the Byzantines for military assistance, since the city was under siege by [[Abu Mansoor Nizar al-Aziz Billah]]. Basil II rushed back to Constantinople with 40,000 men. He gave his army 80,000 mules, one for each soldier and another for their equipment.&lt;ref name="Norwich212"/&gt; The first 17,000 men arrived at Aleppo with great speed, and the hopelessly outnumbered Fatimid army withdrew. Basil II pursued it south, sacking [[Emesa]] and reaching as far as [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]].&lt;ref name="Norwich212"/&gt; Basil returned to the Bulgar front with no further campaigning against the Saracen foe.

Warfare between the two powers continued as the Byzantines supported an [[Revolt of Tyre (996–998)|anti-Fatimid uprising]] in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. In 998, the Byzantines under the successor of Bourtzes, [[Damian Dalassenos]], launched an attack on [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]], but the Fatimid general Jaush ibn al-Samsama defeated them in battle on 19 July 998. This new defeat brought Basil II once again to Syria in October 999. Basil spent three months in Syria, during which the Byzantines raided as far as [[Baalbek]], took and garrisoned [[Shaizar]], and captured three minor forts in its vicinity ([[Abu Qubays|Abu Qubais]], [[Masyaf|Masyath]], and 'Arqah), and sacked [[Rafaniya]]. [[Hims]] was not seriously threatened, but a month-long siege of Tripolis in December failed. However, as Basil's attention was diverted to developments in [[Armenia]], he departed for [[Cilicia]] in January and dispatched another embassy to Cairo. In 1000 a ten-year truce was concluded between the two states.&lt;ref&gt;Lev (1995), pp. 203–205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (1926), p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of the reign of [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] (r. 996–1021), relations remained peaceful, as Hakim was more interested in internal affairs. Even the acknowledgement of Fatimid suzerainty by [[Abu Muhammad Lu'lu' al-Kabir|Lu'lu']] of Aleppo in 1004 and the Fatimid-sponsored installment of [[Aziz al-Dawla|Fatik Aziz al-Dawla]] as the city's emir in 1017 did not lead to a resumption of hostilities, especially since Lu'lu' continued to pay tribute to Byzantium, and Fatik quickly began acting as an independent ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Lev (1995), p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (1926), pp. 254–255&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Hakim's persecution of Christians in his realm, and especially the destruction of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] at his orders in 1009, strained relations and would, along with Fatimid interference in Aleppo, provide the main focus of Fatimid-Byzantine diplomatic relations until the late 1030s.&lt;ref&gt;Lev (1995), pp. 203, 205–208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final battles==
The military force of the Arab world had been in decline since the 9th century, illustrated by losses in Mesopotamia and Syria, and by the slow conquest of Sicily. While the Byzantines attained minor successes against the Arabs, they masked a general decline of the Empire during the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Norwich217"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=217}}. The title page reads, "The Decline Begins, 1025 - 1055"&lt;/ref&gt; The short and uneventful reign of [[Constantine VIII]] (1025-28) was followed by the incompetent [[Romanos III]] (1028-34). When Romanos marched his army to Aleppo, he was [[Battle of Azaz (1030)|ambushed]] by the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this failure, Romanos' general [[George Maniaces]] was able to recover the region and defend Edessa against Arab attack in 1032. Romanos III's successor (and possibly his murderer) [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] ordered an expedition against Sicily under George Maniaces. Initial Byzantine success led to the fall of Messina in 1038, followed by Syracuse in 1040, but the expedition was riddled with internal strife and was diverted to a disastrous course against the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Normans in southern Italy]].&lt;ref name="Norwich221" /&gt;

Following the loss of Sicily and most of southern Italy, the Byzantine Empire collapsed into a state of petty inter-governmental strife. [[Isaac I Komnenos]] took power in 1057,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his brief, two-year rule was too short for effective reform. The Fatimid and Abbasid Caliphate were already busy fighting the [[Seljuq dynasty]]. The Byzantines woke up to this threat under [[Romanos IV]], co-emperor from 1068 to 1071. At the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the Byzantines were defeated by [[Alp Arslan]], head of the [[Great Seljuq Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haldon| 2002|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This defeat, coupled with a civil war, brought most of the Asia Minor under the rule of the Seljuq Turks by 1091.&lt;ref name="Paul180" /&gt; 

In 1081 [[Alexius I Comnenus]] seized power and re-initiated the [[Komnenos|Komnenian dynasty]], initiating a period of [[Komnenian restoration|restoration]]. Byzantine attention was focused primarily on the Normans and the [[Crusades]] during this period, and they would not fight the Arabs again until the end of the reign of [[John II Comnenus]].

===Komnenian expeditions against Egypt===
{{see also|Crusader invasions of Egypt|Komnenian Byzantine army}}
[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|270px|right|&lt;div align="center"&gt;The [[Levant]], 1135&lt;/div&gt;]]

[[John II Komnenos]] pursued a pro-Crusader policy, actively defending the [[Crusader states]] against the forces of [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]]. His army marched and laid siege to Shaizar, but the [[Principality of Antioch]] betrayed the Byzantines with inactiveness.&lt;ref name="Norwich271"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; John II therefore had little choice but to accept the Emir of Mosul's promise of vassalage and annual tribute to Byzantium.&lt;ref name="Norwich271"/&gt; The other choice would have been risking a battle whilst leaving his siege equipment in the hands of the untrustworthy Crusaders. John could have beaten Zengi, but Zengi was not the only potential foe for Byzantium.

John II died in 1143. The foolishness of the Principality of Antioch meant that Edessa fell, and now the great Patriarchate was on the front line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=272}}: "Not only had they made no further progress against the Saracens; they had failed even to preserve John's earlier conquests."&lt;/ref&gt; A failed siege on Damascus in the [[Second Crusade]] forced the Kingdom to turn south against Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Byzantine Emperor, [[Manuel I Komnenos]], enjoyed the idea of conquering Egypt, whose vast resources in grain and in native Christian manpower (from the [[Copts]]) would be no small reward, even if shared with the Crusaders. Alas, Manuel Komnenos worked too quickly for the Crusaders. After three months the [[Siege of Damietta (1169)|Siege of Damietta]] in 1169 failed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Madden|2004|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Crusaders received a mixed diet of defeat (with several invasions failing) and some victories. The Crusaders were able to negotiate with the Fatimids to surrender the capital to a small Crusader garrison and pay annual [[tribute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Madden|2004|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a Crusader breach of the treaty coupled with the rising power of the Muslims led to [[Saladin]] becoming master of Syria and Egypt. 

In 1171, [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] came to Constantinople in person, after Egypt had fallen to Saladin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magdalino|1993|p=75}}&lt;br/&gt;* H.E. Mayer, ''The Latin East'', 657&lt;!--What exactly is going on in this footnote?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1177, a fleet of 150 ships was sent by Manuel I to invade Egypt, but it returned home after appearing off Acre due to the refusal of [[Philip, Count of Flanders]], and many important nobles of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] to help.&lt;ref name="Har"&gt;J. Harris, ''Byzantium and The Crusades'', 109&lt;/ref&gt;

In that year Manuel Komnenos suffered a defeat in the [[Battle of Myriokephalon]] against [[Kilij Arslan II]] of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Madden|2004|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the Byzantine Emperor continued to have an interest in Syria, planning to march his army south in a pilgrimage and show of strength against Saladin's might. Nonetheless, like many of Manuel's goals, this proved unrealistic, and he had to spend his final years working hard to restore the Eastern front against Iconium, which had deteriorated in the time wasted in fruitless Arab campaigns.

'''Central Theatre''' was a [[Broadway theatre]] in New York City built in 1918.  It was located at 1567 Broadway at 47th St., southwest corner, and seated approximately 1,100 patrons.  The architect was [[Herbert J. Krapp]].  The theatre was built by the [[Shubert family]] on a site previously occupied by the [[Frederick Mathushek#Mathushek &amp; Son|Mathushek &amp; Son]] piano factory.&lt;ref name=IBDb&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/venue.php?id=1089#1089 Movieland and Central Theatre], IBDB database, accessed April 21, 2014. The Shuberts retained the five-story piano warehouse on the corner, which they transformed into offices and the entrance lobby of the theatre. ([https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/07/17/102355235.pdf "The Real Estate Field",] ''The New York Times'', July 17, 1917.) It can be seen in [[:c:File:W side of Broadway, 46th-47th St.jpg|this photograph]], published in 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first production at the theatre was the play ''Forever After'', by [[Owen Davis]], which opened in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/09/10/97027256.pdf "War Play Opens Central",] ''The New York Times'', September 10, 1918&lt;/ref&gt;  This moved to [[Playhouse Theatre]] for a long run.  A musical, ''[[Somebody's Sweetheart]]'' (music by [[Antonio Bafunno]]; book and lyrics by [[Alonzo Price]]), was a success at the theatre in 1919–20.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/12/24/98275909.pdf "''Somebody's Sweetheart''",] ''The New York Times'', December 24, 1918&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] made his debut as librettist in January 1920 with ''Always You'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/01/06/102732695.pdf "''Always You'' Is Amusing",] ''The New York Times'', January 6, 1920. The show went on tour after less than two months.

The theatre introduced movies in 1921 and alternated the new medium with live theatre and [[American burlesque]] until 1957, although legitimate theatre was absent from 1934 to 1951.  It changed its name to the '''Columbia Theatre''' in 1934, '''Gotham Theatre''' in 1944 and the '''Holiday Theatre''' in 1951.  A successful revue, ''Bagels and Yox'' played in 1951.  A revival of ''[[Abie's Irish Rose]]'' played in 1954.  Legitimate theatre ended at the house in 1956.  Under the names '''Odeon''', then the '''Forum''', and finally '''Movieland''', the theatre played movies until 1988, when the Shuberts sold it. The building was converted into other uses.  Its lobby became the Roxy Deli, and the auditorium became first a disco, Club USA, and, in 2005, a [[W Hotel]].&lt;ref name=IBDb/&gt;

[[File:Cockpit-in-Court - engraving by Mazell.png|thumb|Cockpit-in-Court from an engraving by Mazell in Pennant's ''London'', reproduced in the ''London Topographical Record'' (1903)]]

The '''Cockpit-in-Court''' (also known as the '''Royal Cockpit''') was an early theatre in London, located at the rear of the [[Palace of Whitehall]], next to [[St. James's Park]], now the site of 70 [[Whitehall]], in [[Westminster]].

The structure was originally built by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], after he had acquired [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]]'s [[York Place]] to the north of the [[Palace of Westminster]], following the Cardinal's downfall in 1529. It was one of a number of new pleasure buildings constructed for King Henry's entertainment, including a [[real tennis]] court, a [[bowling alley]], and a [[tiltyard]], and was used as an actual cockpit; that is, an area for staging [[cockfighting]]. Thus enlarged, the Palace of Whitehall became the main London residence of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] Kings of England, and the Palace of Westminster was relegated to ceremonial and administrative purposes only.&lt;ref name="mod"&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/History/HistoryOfTheOldWarOffice/TheLocationWhitehall.htm The Location - Whitehall], [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cockpit-in-Court plans.png|thumb|Inigo Jones plans for the Cockpit-in-Court]]

The Cockpit ceased to be used for cockfighting in Jacobean times, and was used instead as a private theatre and as chambers for members of the Royal Household.  It was redesigned in 1629 for [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] by [[Inigo Jones]] as a private venue for staging [[court masque]]s.  It was the second cockpit that Jones had redesigned as a theatre, the other being the [[Cockpit Theatre]] in [[Drury Lane]], which was renovated after a fire in 1617.

After the [[London theatre closure 1642|London theatre closure]] of the [[Interregnum]], the Cockpit returned to use under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and was refitted in 1662. A new [[dressing room]] was added for female players, whose presence onstage was a recent theatrical innovation; its walls were decorated with green [[baize]], one possible origin of the theatrical term "[[green room]]" for a dressing room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_se/murray/Restoration/Theatres/ThAlt.html Alternative Theatres].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Samuel Pepys]] records attending several plays at the Cockpit in his diary.

[[File:Whitehall1680.jpg|thumb|300px|A retrospective plan of [[Whitehall Palace]] as it was in 1680, by Fisher.  The Cockpit is the [[octagon]]al building near the top left corner.  The [[Banqueting House]] is just to the left of the centre.  Whitehall follows the line of the road marked "White Hall" from the right and continues through the west side of the [[Privy Garden of the Palace of Whitehall|Privy Garden]]. North is to the right.]]
In 1680, it was occupied by the [[Duke of Albemarle]] in his official capacity as [[Master of the Great Wardrobe]], and later by [[Ralph, 1st Duke of Montagu]] in the same capacity.

Charles II gave the Cockpit to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]], daughter of Charles's brother [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], in 1683. Anne and her closest friend, [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah, Lady Churchill]] were imprisoned here during the [[Glorious Revolution]]; both their husbands, [[Prince George of Denmark]] and [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John, Baron Churchill]] switched their allegiances from James II to [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. Sarah and Anne escaped to [[Nottingham]] shortly afterwards. The Palace of Whitehall was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1698.  One prominent structure to survive was the [[Banqueting House]], also designed by Inigo in 1619; another, lesser, structure to survive, was the Cockpit.  After the fire, [[William III of England|William III]] moved his London residence to nearby [[St James's Palace]], and the site was rebuilt to be used as government offices, and residential and commercial premises.&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt;  The Cockpit was used to house government officials.  It was first occupied by [[HM Treasury]], whose offices elsewhere in the palace had been destroyed, until the Treasury moved to a new building on [[Horse Guards Road]] in 1734.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/about/about_building/about_goggs_goggs.cfm The Treasury Building - 1 Horse Guards Road], [[HM Treasury]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When Anne became queen after the death of William in 1702, she gave the residence to her loyal friends John and Sarah, now Duke and Duchess of Marlborough. They vacated the residence during Anne's reign and it became the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. After the Treasury moved, it was used in the late 18th century by the [[Foreign Office]], after that government office had been founded at Cleveland Row, St James's but before it moved to [[Downing Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1017756048996 FCO Buildings: Historical Background], [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, it was used by the [[Privy Council]] as a council chamber, for judicial purposes.  It continued to be used by the Privy Council after a new chamber was built for them in 1827.  The current building on the site, at 70 Whitehall, is used by the [[Cabinet Office]]. The reconstructed Cockpit Passage in 70 Whitehall runs along the edge of the old tennis courts and into Kent's Treasury, built on the site of the original cockpit lodgings. The [[minstrel's gallery]] on the ground floor is currently decorated with pictures of [[fighting cocks]] and a model of the old Whitehall palace. 

It should not be confused with Cockpit Steps nearby in St James Park, which lead up from [[Birdcage Walk]] past the site of a royal cockpit in [[Old Queen Street]].

The '''Comic Art Convention''' was an [[People of the United States|American]] [[comic book]] [[fan convention]] held annually [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], over [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] weekend from 1968 through 1983, except for 1977, when it was held in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and 1978 to 1979, when editions of the convention were held in both New York and Philadelphia. The first large-scale [[comics convention]], and one of the largest gatherings of its kind until the [[Comic-Con International]] in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]], it grew into a major trade and fan convention. It was founded by [[Phil Seuling]], a [[Brooklyn]], New York City, teacher, who later developed the concept of comic-book [[direct market]]ing, which led to the rise to the modern comic book store.

The New York Comic Art Convention's growth in popularity coincided with the increasing media attention on comics that had been building since the mid-1960s, feeding off the then novel notions of comics being a subject worthy of serious critical study and collectibility.

==History==
Circa 1961, enterprising fans including [[Jerry Bails]], [[Shel Dorf]], Bernie Bubnis, and future [[Marvel Comics]] [[editing|editor-in-chief]] [[Roy Thomas]] began following the pattern of the long-established [[science fiction fandom]] by publishing [[fanzines]], corresponding with one another and with comic-book editors (most notably [[DC Comics]]' [[Julius Schwartz]]), and eventually arranging informal and later professional, commercial conventions.&lt;ref name="Build"&gt;[[Bill Schelly|Schelly, Bill]]. "Jerry Bails' Ten Building Blocks of Fandom," ''Alter Ego'' vol. 3, #25 (June 2003) pp. 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first were the 1964 Tri-State Con (a.k.a. the New York Comicon)&lt;ref&gt;Schelly, Bill. ''Founders of Comic Fandom: Profiles of 90 Publishers, Dealers, Collectors, Writers, Artists and Other Luminaries of the 1950s and 1960s'' (McFarland, 2010), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; and that same year's precursor to the [[Detroit Triple Fan Fair]]&lt;ref name=Power&gt;Duncan, Randy; and Smith, Matthew J. ''The Power of Comics: History, Form and Culture'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2009), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinn, Dez.

Accessed Mar. 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; (officially established in 1965).&lt;ref name=Founders&gt;[[Bill Schelly|Schelly, Bill]]. ''Founders'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Seuling described his convention's genesis, "In 1964, about a hundred people found themselves in a New York City [[Trade union|union]] meeting hall, a large open room with wooden folding chairs, looking around at each other oddly, surprised, not really knowing what they were there for, a bit sheepish, waiting for whatever was going to take place to begin. ... It was the first comics convention ever [and t]hat one-day assembly ... grew step by step into an annual tradition in New York and then elsewhere."&lt;ref name=Seuling1977&gt;Seuling, Phil. 1977 Comic Art Convention program book (Sea Gate Distributors, 1977), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the [[Academy of Comic-Book Fans and Collectors]] hosted a convention at New York's [[Broadway Central Hotel]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Roy. "Splitting the Atom: More Than You Could Possibly Want to Know About the Creation of the Silver Age Mighty Mite!" ''The Alter Ego Collection, Volume 1'' (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2006), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; continuing that tradition in 1966 and 1967. The so-called "[[Academy Con]]s" featured such industry professionals as [[Otto Binder]], [[Bill Finger]], [[Gardner Fox]], [[Mort Weisinger]], [[James Warren (publisher)|James Warren]], [[Roy Thomas]], [[Gil Kane]],&lt;ref name=Founders /&gt; [[Stan Lee]], [[Bill Everett]], [[Carmine Infantino]], and [[Julius Schwartz]].&lt;ref name=AlterEgo64&gt;Schelly, Bill.

(Part VIII of '1966: The Year Of (Nearly) Three New York Comics Conventions')," ''Alter-Ego'' #64 (Jan. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

As Seuling told it, "In 1968, I became involved in [staging] my first convention. The following year began the current series called the Comic Art Convention".&lt;ref name=Seuling1977 /&gt; (The 1968 show, officially known as the '''International Convention of Comic Book Art''', was co-produced with SCARP, the short-lived Society for Comic Art Research and Preservation, Inc.)&lt;ref name=Newfangles6&gt;[[Maggie Thompson|Thompson, Maggie]].

The 1969 convention, the first official Comic Art Convention, was held [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] weekend at the [[Statler Hilton Hotel]] in New York City, and the guest of honor was [[Hal Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;Groth, Gary. "Editorial: Con Games", ''The Comics Journal'' #76 (Oct. 1, 1982), pp. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Admittance to the convention cost $3.50 for a three-day ticket, with daily passes at $1.50.&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splashpages.com/wood/woodlist/catalogprogramsketchbook/comicartcon1969.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5weU0xyBW?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071004215132/splashpages.com/wood/woodlist/catalogprogramsketchbook/comicartcon1969.html|archivedate=February 21, 2011|title=The 1969 Comic Art Convention Progress Report|publisher=SplashPages.com|deadurl=yes|df=}} Additional, February 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Admittance was free with a hotel room rental, which cost $15-and-up per day.&lt;ref name=report /&gt;

The final three years of the 1961-1969 [[Alley Awards]], sponsored by ''[[Alter Ego (fanzine)|Alter Ego]]'' magazine and the [[Academy of Comic-Book Fans and Collectors]], were presented at the Comic Art Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Gabilliet, Jean-Paul (trans. by Bart Beaty and Nick Nguyen). ''Of Comics and Men: A Cultural History of American Comic Books'' (University of Mississippi Press, 2010), pp. 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt; After the demise of the Alley, later years featured the [[Goethe Award (comics)|Goethe Award]]s&lt;ref&gt;"The 1971 Goethe Awards" (ballot), ''Graphic Story World'' vol. 2, #2 (whole #6) (July 1972), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; (later renamed the "Comic Fan Art Awards").&lt;ref&gt;[[John Jackson Miller|Miller, John Jackson]].

In 1973, Seuling persuaded Dr. [[Fredric Wertham]], author of the industry-changing 1954 book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'', to attend what would be Wertham's only panel with an audience of comics fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comic-art.com/biographies/wertham1.htm |publisher=Comic Art &amp; Graffix Gallery|title=Biographies: Fredric Wertham, M.D.| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716132312/http://www.comic-art.com/biographies/wertham1.htm | archivedate=July 16, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1974 show featured a panel on the role of women in comics, with [[Marie Severin]], [[Flo Steinberg]], Jean Thomas (sometime-collaborator with then-husband [[Roy Thomas]]), [[Linda Fite]] (writer of ''The Claws of the Cat''), and fan representative Irene Vartanoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Cons: New York 1974! | publisher= Paul Kowtiuk, Maple Leaf Publications; editorial office then at Box 1286, Essex, Ontario, Canada N0R 1E0 | work=The Journal Summer Special | date=1974| authorlink=Frank Lovece | last = Lovece | first = Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1984, as his comic-book distribution business occupied more time, and as other comics conventions, most notably in [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego]] and [[Chicago Comicon|Chicago]], became larger, more prominent, and more commercial- rather than fan-driven, Seuling segued the Independence Day-centered Comic Art Convention into the smaller '''Manhattan Con''', which took place in mid-June.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;Grant, Steven. [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=14149 "Permanent Damage: Issue #43,"] ''Comic Book Resources'' (July 10, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Seuling died unexpectedly in August 1984, and the Comic Art Convention/Manhattan Con died with him.

==Legacy==
[[Image:1977ComicArtConventionProgram.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Program book featuring [[Swamp Thing]]  art by [[Berni Wrightson]] (as he then spelled his first name).]]
The Comic Art Conventions provided the primary nexus for fans and the largely New York City-based industry during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] and the [[Bronze Age of comic books]]. As well, many of the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] creators were still alive and in attendance at panels and for interviews, which helped lay the groundwork for the [[Recording medium|medium]]'s historical scholarship.

The reputation of the Convention spread throughout fandom via an annual write-up published in ''[[The Buyer's Guide to Comics Fandom]]'' by columnist [[Murray Bishoff]]. Besides reporting on convention events, Bishoff also provided fans around the country with a benchmark market report by surveying attending dealers regarding what was selling and whether prices realized were above or below those quoted in the de facto standard, ''[[The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]]''.

[[Will Eisner]], creator of the [[Spirit (comics)|Spirit]] in 1940, credited the 1971 Comic Art Con for his return to comics. In a 1983 interview with Seuling, he said, "I came back into the field because of you. I remember you calling me in [[New London, Connecticut|New London, [Connecticut]]], where I was sitting there as chairman of the board of Croft Publishing Co. My secretary said, 'There's a Mr. Seuling on the phone and he's talking about a comics convention. What is that?' She said, 'I didn't know you were a [[cartoonist]], Mr. Eisner.' 'Oh, yes,' I said, 'secretly; I'm a closet cartoonist.' I came down and was stunned at the existence of the whole world. ... That was a world that I had left, and I found it very exciting, very stimulating".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Groth|Groth, Gary]]. [http://archives.tcj.com/267/e_groth.html "Will Eisner: Chairman of the Board"], ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #267, May 2005.[https://www.webcitation.org/5weUkDyLJ?url=http://archives.tcj.com/267/e_groth.html WebCitation archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisner later elaborated about meeting [[underground comics]] creators and publishers, including [[Denis Kitchen]]
{{quote|I went down to the convention, which was being held in one of the hotels in New York, and there was a group of guys with long hair and scraggly beards, who had been turning out what spun as [[literature]], really popular 'gutter' literature if you will, but pure literature. And they were taking on illegal [sic] subject matter that no comics had ever dealt with before. ... I came away from that recognizing that a revolution had occurred then, a turning point in the history of this medium. ... I reasoned that the 13-year-old kids that I'd been writing to back in the 1940s were no longer 13-year-old kids, they were now 30, 40 years old. They would want something more than two heroes, two supermen, crashing against each other. I began working on a book that dealt with a subject that I felt had never been tried by comics before, and that was man's relationship with [[God]].

Following Seuling's death in 1984 and continuing until 1988, [[Creation Entertainment]] continued producing large annual conventions in New York City, usually taking place over the weekend following [[Thanksgiving]] (Creation had begun hosting New York shows in 1971, and sometimes put on as many as a half-dozen New York City shows per year).&lt;ref name=Grant /&gt; From 1993–1995, promoter Fred Greenberg hosted two [[Great Eastern Conventions]] annually at venues including the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]] and the [[New York Coliseum]]. Other companies, including Dynamic Forces, held New York City conventions but all were on a smaller scale than the Seuling shows. Changes in the industry, popular culture, and the resurgent city itself since the troubled 1960s and '70s made large-scale comic-book conventions difficult to hold profitably. Jonah Weiland of ComicBookResources.com also noted that "...dealing with the various convention unions made it difficult for most groups to get a show off the ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiland|first=Jonah|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=5400|title=Battling Conventions?

In 1996, Greenberg, at a very late point, cancelled what had been advertised as a larger-than-usual [[Great Eastern Conventions]] show, which the fan press had suggested&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: NYC Comics Convention Cancelled, Fans Irate," ''The Comics Journal'' #185 (Mar. 1996), pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; might herald a successor to the Comic Art Con. As a substitute event, promoter Michael Carbonaro and others on the spur of the moment mounted the first [[Big Apple Convention]] in the basement of Manhattan's [[Church of St. Paul the Apostle (New York City)|Church of St. Paul the Apostle]].&lt;ref name=Pate&gt;Pate, Brian [http://www.conventionscene.com/2012/03/30/mike-carbonaro-retiring-from-convention-promoting-with-final-2012-nycbm-show/#u8E2y4liHsA2mPPg.99 "Mike Carbonaro Retiring From Convention Promoting with Final 2012 NYCBM Show,"] Convention Scene (Mar. 30, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; These small shows nonetheless attracted many comics creators and pop-culture figures, and by 2000 the convention had moved to the Metropolitan Pavilion on West 18th Street in Manhattan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000930040024/http://www.bigapplecon.com/unflash.html |title=Big Apple Comic Book, Art &amp; Toy Show|date=November 10–12, 2000| archivedate=September 30, 2000|publisher=BigAppleCon.com|url=http://www.bigapplecon.com/unflash.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the mid-2000s were taking place at the Penn Plaza Pavilion at the [[Hotel Pennsylvania]] — the same location of the original Comic Art Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013082323/http://www.bigapplecon.com/ |title=The National Comic Book, Art &amp; Sci-Fi Expo|date=November 19–21, 2004|archivedate=October 13, 2004|publisher=BigAppleCon.com|url=http://www.bigapplecon.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509134048/http://www.bigapplecon.com/ |title=Big Apple Comic Book, Art, Toy &amp; Sci-Fi Expo|date=June 7–8, 2008|archivedate=May 9, 2008|publisher=BigAppleCon.com|url=http://www.bigapplecon.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930100426/http://www.bigapplecon.com/ |title=Big Apple Comic Book, Art, Toy &amp; Sci-Fi Epo|date=November 14–16, 2008|archivedate=September 30, 2008|publisher=BigAppleCon.com|url=http://www.bigapplecon.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the first [[MoCCA Art Festival]], focused on [[alternative comics]] and the small press, was held at New York City’s  [[Puck Building]]; it has been held annually since. In 2006, the first [[New York Comic Con]] was held in the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]]; it also has been held annually since.

&lt;!--[[Image:Accident d'Eckwersheim.jpg|right|thumb|Rear power car being raised from the [[Marne–Rhine Canal]]]]--&gt;
On 14 November 2015, a [[TGV]] train [[derailment|derailed]] in [[Eckwersheim]], [[Alsace]], France, while performing commissioning trials on the second phase of the [[LGV Est]] high-speed rail line, which was scheduled to open for commercial service five months later. The derailment resulted in 11 deaths among those aboard, while the 42 others aboard the train were injured. It was the first fatal derailment in the history of the TGV and the third derailment since the TGV entered commercial service in 1981.&lt;ref name="bbc34822666"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34822666|title=French TGV high-speed train derails near Strasbourg|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=14 November 2015|access-date=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dna"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dna.fr/actualite/2015/11/14/un-train-se-renverse-et-prend-feu-a-eckwersheim-pres-de-strasbourg|title=Accident de la rame d'essai de TGV : 10 morts, douze blessés dans un état grave, cinq personnes recherchées, numéro vert mis en place|language=fr|newspaper=[[Les Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace]]|date=14 November 2015|last1=Bach|first1=Christian|last2=Poivret|first2=Aurélien}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Figaro: First fatal TGV accident"/&gt;

The test train was traveling eastbound on the southern track when it entered a curve at {{convert|265|km/h|abbr=on}}—which was {{convert|89|km/h|abbr=on}} above its assigned speed—causing the rear [[bogie]] of the lead [[power car]] to derail to the left (outside of curve) due to [[centrifugal force]]s. The lead power car separated from the rest of the train, and the rear of the lead power car struck the concrete [[Parapet#bridge parapets|parapet]] on the [[abutment]] to a bridge over the [[Marne–Rhine Canal]]. The power car slid along the left parapet of the bridge and overturned, sliding down the embankment and coming to a rest {{convert|150|m}} beyond the end of the bridge. Cars 2–7 derailed before the bridge and travelled off the embankment with enough speed to overshoot the canal and come to rest {{convert|80|-|130|m|abbr=on}} beyond the beginning of the bridge.&lt;ref name="SNCF report 19 Nov"/&gt;{{Rp|21}} Cars 8–9 came to rest on the east bank of the canal and the rear power car ended up partially submerged in the canal. According to investigators, late braking, which led to the train entering the curve at excessive speed, was the immediate cause of the accident. Criminal and technical investigations are {{as of|2015|11|14|alt=ongoing}}. French national rail operator [[SNCF]] suspended test trials at high speeds until the lessons learned from the investigation were integrated into testing process. The scheduled opening of the second phase of the LGV Est for commercial service was delayed three months, from 3 April 2016 to 3 July 2016.&lt;ref name="Opening delay"/&gt;

==Background==
The [[LGV Est|LGV Est européenne]] (often shortened to ''LGV Est'') is a high-speed rail line connecting [[Paris]] and [[Strasbourg]]. Development has been divided into two phases. The first phase, from [[Vaires-sur-Marne]] near Paris, to [[Baudrecourt, Moselle|Baudrecourt]] opened on 10 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LGV Est Européenne / Les enjeux du Projet|url=http://www.lgv-est.com/decouvrir/les-enjeux-du-projet/|publisher=SNCF Réseau|accessdate=26 November 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction on the {{convert|106|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} second phase, from Baudrecourt to [[Vendenheim]], near Strasbourg, began in 2010.&lt;ref name="RG: testing begins"/&gt; The final [[welding|weld]] of rails on the second phase occurred in March 2015, marking the completion of the line, although some work remained.&lt;ref name="RG: Phase 2 complete"&gt;{{cite news|title=LGV Est Phase 2 completed|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/lgv-est-phase-2-completed.html|work=Railway Gazette|date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the derailment, the line was scheduled to open for commercial service on 3 April 2016, following commissioning trials and training for operators.&lt;ref name="RG: Phase 2 complete"/&gt;

The scheduled tests for the line consisted of four phases:&lt;ref name="SNCF derailment webpage"/&gt;
#Factory testing of components of the line, completed in 2013–14;
#On-site testing of components and functioning of subsystems, completed in 2013–2014;
#Static testing of subsystems with slow-moving trains, completed from late 2014 to August 2015;
#Dynamic testing of the line with trains operating at high speed, began in September 2015 and scheduled to have been completed in November 2015.

A specialized test train, [[SNCF TGV Duplex#Dasye|Dasye]] set&amp;nbsp;744 in a commemorative [[livery]], arrived to conduct the fourth phase of testing, which began on 28 September 2015.&lt;ref name="RG: testing begins"&gt;{{cite news|title=Testing starts on LGV Est Phase 2|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/high-speed/single-view/view/testing-starts-on-lgv-est-phase-2.html|accessdate=15 November 2015|work=Railway Gazette|date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this phase, more than 200 test runs would be performed on the line. The test runs would test ride smoothness, performance of the [[overhead lines|catenary]], radio communications, and the [[railway signalling|signalling system]].&lt;ref name="RG: testing begins"/&gt; During some runs, the test train would operate at 10% above the planned operational speeds for the line when it enters service.&lt;ref name=RG&gt;{{cite news|title=Test train catastrophe on LGV Est|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/high-speed/single-view/view/test-train-catastrophe-on-lgv-est.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|work=Railway Gazette|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some automated safety systems were disabled to allow the test train to operate beyond normal operating conditions.&lt;ref name="SNCF derailment webpage"/&gt; Orientation training for operators was scheduled to take place between January and March 2016 prior to the start of commercial service on the line, which was scheduled for 3 April 2016 at the time of the accident.&lt;ref name="SNCF derailment webpage"/&gt; In January 2016, SNCF announced that the opening of the line would be delayed until to 3 July 2016.&lt;ref name="Opening delay"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Cérémonie hommage victimes TGV Strasbourg 16 novembre 2015.jpg|thumb|Ceremony in remembrance of the victims at Strasbourg station, 16 November]]

[[File:Every 15 Minutes rescuing victims Alamogordo 2010.jpg|thumb|alt=Emergency responders rescuing victims at a simulated car crash scene.|Every 15 Minutes programs can include a simulated car crash scene with teenage "victims."]]'''Every 15 Minutes''' is a two-day program focusing on high school juniors and seniors, which challenges them to think about [[Alcohol consumption|drinking]], driving, personal safety, and the responsibility of making mature decisions. Along with alcohol-related [[car crashes|crashes]], it focuses on the impact that their decisions would have on [[family]] and [[friendship|friends]].

The Every 15 Minutes program originated in [[Canada]] and was soon adopted in the United States first in [[Spokane, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Every 15 Minutes|url=http://ci.santa-rosa.ca.us/departments/police/aboutus/special_services/Pages/Every15Minutes.aspx|website=Santa Rosa Police Department|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the first Every 15 Minutes program in California was in [[Chico, California|Chico]] which was presented by the Chico Police Department in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Every 15 Minutes|url=http://www.chp.ca.gov/programs/pdf/E15M_factsheet.pdf|website=California Highway Patrol|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning and events==

===Planning===
The Every 15 Minutes program starts months in advance of the actual presentation, in fact the very first program at a school will take about one-year to plan and prepare. This includes all of the involved agencies, the police, fire department, paramedics, hospital, court, lawyers, judge, jail facilities, coroner/funeral home, students, parents and school administrators. Student participants are selected to cover the full spectrum of the student body, thus, the audience will be able to relate to at least one of the participants on the crash day.

===Recent advances===
Due in large part to major grants and guidance by the [[Highway Patrol]], the program has made its way to even more students' hometowns. In recent years, the [[California Highway Patrol]] has continued to fine-tune the Every 15 Minutes program, which has always been over two-days - day one being the crash, with day two as the assembly, featuring speakers ranging from the student participants and their parents to motivational speakers, relatives who have lost loved ones in drunk-driving crashes (there are no drunk-driving "accidents"), medical personnel, lawyers and law enforcement officials.

In southern California the program has also been modified by a civilian coordinator who has taken the audience away from watching on the sidewalk to sitting in bleachers, allowing for better viewing; eliminating the grim reaper (often viewed by students as unreal); and adding a texting element to the sober driver. This element brings the program added reality, as current figures indicate more teens are being killed in text-related crashes than in drunk-driving crashes. However, the grants are dedicated to drunk-driving and would be eliminated if too much emphasis was placed on texting. To still maintain the drinking emphasis, it is mentioned that the sober driver could have lessened the severity of injuries or death had they been concentrating on the road and not on the phone.

Since its inception, technology has improved, giving a rise to the impact of the program and the gravity of the issue of drunk driving. During the event, new technology has allowed for a quick turn around of [[videography]], allowing a comprehensive video of the [[Causality|cause and effect]] relationship between drunken driving and police involvement, family burden and community loss to be played at the second day's assembly. While student videographers sometimes take on this job, it is more common for professional crews to do the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Every 15 Minutes at Germantown High School|url=http://www.publicsafety.photos/Events/13/4-25-2013|website=Wisconsin Public Safety Photo Library|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, there has been a revival of student work, as schools either ask for one or two of their students to apprentice with the professionals, or students create a "making-of" film, shadowing the entire E15 process.

Recently the program has been extended. Kids are made to play the actual roles within the accident, especially in California. Cars are crashed, students bloody and handcuffed, and parents are told their children have been killed. Some protest this, saying it is traumatizing.

==Effectiveness==
Studies that have tracked students before and after the Every 15 Minutes program have shown that the program may have a favorable short-term effect on students' stated attitudes but no effect on actual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Measuring%20the%20effectiveness%20of%20a%20community-sponsored%20DWI%20intervention...-a083076569&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to charges that the Every 15 Minutes program is similar to the controversial [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education|DARE]] anti-drug program in that it produces the appearance of addressing the problem but does not produce the desired change in behavior. It has been long known that these types of approaches (i.e. scare tactics, dramatizations) that attempt to increase awareness or improve knowledge are ineffective. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=cCfdODo60P4C&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;ots=PUg9f2IOC4&amp;dq=scare%20tactics%20dramatizations%20health%20promotion%20knowledge%20ineffective&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q=scare%20tactics%20dramatizations%20health%20promotion%20knowledge%20ineffective&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highlandnews.net/opinion/columnists/every-minutes-programs-don-t-work/article_27a06428-4e55-11e8-961a-9303a259f2ba.html |title="Every 15 Minutes Programs Don’t Work" Highland News Service; April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Questions have also been raised about the basic premise of the program, that one person dies every 15 minutes in an alcohol-related crash. The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] reports that in 1995, the first year the program was presented, the rate was actually one death every 30.4 minutes in the United States.  This was using the NHTSA's very broad definition of "alcohol-related" wherein the crash was defined as "alcohol-related" if any person involved had a blood alcohol level of 0.01% or higher. The nationally recognized DUI level of presumption in the United States is 0.08%.  The rate of alcohol-related fatalities has gradually declined and was one death every 40.4 minutes in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 Traffic Safety Annual Assessment|url=http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811016.PDF|website=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; one death every 45 minutes in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Traffic Safety Annual Assessment|url=http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811172.pdf|website=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one death every 56.5 minutes in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812348|title=Quick Facts 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FIGMENT''' is an annual [[Participatory Art|participatory arts]] event that began on [[Governors Island]] in [[New York Harbor]], United States in 2007, and has since spread to a number of other cities. The mission of FIGMENT is to provide a forum for community-based participatory art and experience. FIGMENT strives to build community among artists and participants, to foster the participatory arts in [[New York City]], and to demonstrate a vision for the future of Governors Island as an international arts destination. FIGMENT is a community-based event organized and run by volunteers.

The event draws its name from New York’s artistic heritage. [[Andy Warhol]] once commented that he would like his tombstone to have only one word on it: “Figment.” Warhol never got his wish; he has a traditional grave marker.

FIGMENT is based on 11 principles including participation, inclusion, [[decommodification]] and [[leave no trace]].

Art projects are solicited for FIGMENT through a curatorial process, based on artistic merit, ambitiousness, and interactivity. FIGMENT focuses on art projects that demonstrate an ability to transform their environment and the perception of participants.

FIGMENT is produced by Figment Project, Inc., a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization registered in New York State. This not-for-profit organization was originally formed as Action Arts League, Inc., in 2006. The Board of Directors decided to rename the organization Figment Project, Inc., in December 2010, and the name change was acknowledged by the New York State Department of State on February 9, 2011.

The event is currently supported by individual donations and by grants. FIGMENT does not accept any corporate sponsorships.

==FIGMENT 2007==
FIGMENT was launched in 2007 as a one-day event on July 8. FIGMENT attracted over 60 participatory arts projects, and hosted over 2,600 participants.

==FIGMENT 2008==
In 2008, FIGMENT was a three-day event on June 27–29. Nearly 10,000 people attended the event, and attendance records were set for Governors Island for the most people ever on the island on a Friday (1,486), on a Saturday (5,305), and on a Sunday (3,174), and over a single weekend (9,965).

Two special projects include the City of Dreams Minigolf course (open from June 27 to October 12, 2008), and the Emergence exhibition (open from May 31 to July 26, 2008). Both of these special projects were funded by the Black Rock Arts Foundation. It is estimated that approximately 50,000 visitors to the island engaged with these exhibitions over the summer of 2008.

==FIGMENT 2009==
[[File:Labyrinth of Failure.jpg|thumb|A miniature golf hole in the style of a large ''[[Labyrinth (marble game)|Labyrinth]]'' game, from the 2009 festival]]
FIGMENT 2009 took place on June 12–14 on Governors Island. In addition to the main festival, FIGMENT expanded the City of Dreams Minigolf Course to 18 holes, and added a season-long exhibition of interactive sculpture. Both of these projects together are called the "City of Dreams."

FIGMENT 2009 was attended by 13,331 people, including 1,139 participants on Friday, June 12; 5,488 participants on Saturday, June 13; and 6,704 participants on Sunday, June 14.

FIGMENT received six grants in 2009, including The Fund for Creative Communities, supported by the New York State Council on the Arts, and the Manhattan Community Arts Fund, supported by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs. Both funds are administered by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council. In addition, four large-scale sculptures in the City of Dreams season-long sculpture installation have received the 2009 Oscar M. Ruebhausen Commission from the Greenwall Foundation.

==FIGMENT 2010==
In 2010, FIGMENT added an event in [[Boston]] to its event in New York. FIGMENT Boston took place on June 5, 2010, along the [[Charles River]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], in partnership with the [[Cambridge Arts Council]], with approximately 10,000 participants who engaged with nearly 100 arts projects. FIGMENT New York took place on June 11–13, 2010, on Governors Island, with a total of 23,665 participants: 4,103 on Friday, 9,856 on Saturday, and 9,706 on Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://figmentproject.org/ FIGMENT project].&lt;/ref&gt;

FIGMENT created another summer-long [[minigolf]] course and [[sculpture garden]] in 2010 on Governors Island, and added an architectural competition to design and build a pavilion on the island as a center for arts activity. The City of Dreams Pavilion Design Competition was being jointly hosted by FIGMENT, the [[Emerging New York Architects]] (ENYA) committee of the New York Chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA), and the [[Structural Engineers Association of New York]] (SEAoNY). The competition received over 50 entries, and a jury of architects, journalists, and engineers selected Ann Ha and Behrang Behin's Living Pavilion as the winner of the competition. The Living Pavilion was built on the Parade Grounds on Governors Island, and opened in time for FIGMENT on June 11. The Living Pavilion, Minigolf Course, and Sculpture Garden were open on the island through October 3, 2010, and were visited by an estimated 200,000 visitors to the island.

==FIGMENT 2011==
In 2011, FIGMENT added events in Jackson, Mississippi and Detroit, Michigan, for a total of four events. The season began with the event in Jackson on May 21–22. Then next was Boston (relocated from Memorial Drive to the Rose Kennedy Greenway) on June 4–5. Then FIGMENT NYC on Governors Island on June 10–12. And finally FIGMENT Detroit on Belle Isle on August 6.

2011 brought much more interest and collaboration from public officials. Mayor Harvey Johnson visited FIGMENT Jackson on May 21. Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston issued a proclamation naming June 4 as "FIGMENT Boston Day" in the City of Boston. And New York State Senator Daniel Squadron visited FIGMENT NYC on June 10 and gave a press conference with Trust for Governors Island President Leslie Koch and FIGMENT Executive Producer David Koren.

FIGMENT NYC was named the Best Art Festival in New York by the Village Voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/bestof/2011/award/best-art-festival-3130224 |title=Best Art Festival 2011: Figment Festival |publisher=Village Voice |date=Oct 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIGMENT's brand received a design award in late 2011 by the [[AIGA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/case-study-figment// |title=FIGMENT Brand wins AIGA's "Making the Case" Competition |publisher=AIGA |date=Nov 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, FIGMENT received a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] for the first time ever,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nea.gov/grants/recent/12grants/12AAE.php?CAT=Art%20Works&amp;DIS=Presenting |title=NEA 2012 2012 Grant Awards: Art Works |publisher=NEA |date=Nov 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for its 2012 season.

The '''Gorgeous Guy''' was the name given to a man whose photo appeared on an internet [[message board]], with various posts describing his life. The photo was of '''Dan Baca''', and it was later revealed to be an elaborate hoax, set up by Baca himself.

In May 2001, Dan Baca, a 29-year-old computer network engineer began to notice people were staring at him as he waited for his bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/07/03/internet.fame/ |title=Internet plucks San Francisco man from obscurity |date=2001-07-07 |first=James |last=Hattori |work=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2008-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301031227/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/07/03/internet.fame/ |archivedate=2008-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people would start conversations with him, and then some people started taking photos of him. They appeared to be familiar with his routine, what clothes he wore, and what color his bag was. He was eventually told that his photo had been posted to an internet message board, ''[[Craigslist]]'', on May 11, and there were numerous comments written about him. The thread, entitled "Gorgeous Guy @ 4th and Market at the MUNI/Amtrak Bus Stop (Mon-Fri)" became the most popular in the "missed connections" section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2001-06-19-ebrief.htm |first=Janet |last=Kornblum |date=2001-06-19 |title=Web transforms commuter into 'The Gorgeous Guy' |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The picture's caption read "Gorgeous Guy", and the anonymous poster wanted to know who he was, and if they could meet up with him. Various posts that followed discussed various aspects of Baca's personal life, such as his facial features, his marital status, and his sexuality. They also discussed his schedule and who was going to date him. Baca eventually posted a message, asking people to stop talking to him and about him, but doing so caused more problems, and Baca had to resort to other forms of transport to get to work.

== Media attention ==
The story came to the media's attention when [[David Cassel (journalist)|David Cassel]], a freelance journalist was tipped off about the story by [[Mat Honan]], a freelance writer from [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2001-07-11-ebrief.htm |first=Janet |last=Kornblum |date=2001-07-11 |title=Tangled Web snares S.F.'s 'gorgeous guy' |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cassel published an article in the ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]'' on May 30, keeping Baca's name confidential. Following this, ''[[CNN]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'' both published articles, including his real name. Various other news outlets also contacted him. Despite Baca's original plea for privacy, he intended to take the chance to make the most of his fame; he expressed interest in becoming a model, actor, or becoming involved in charity work.

== Hoax ==
On July 11, 2001, Baca revealed that the whole thing was a hoax. He was said to have made over 50 posts using various email addresses on ''Craigslist'', pretending to be other people. He also explained that he made up most of the stories about people recognizing him in the street. Baca apparently had no motive for the hoax, claiming he was just "playing around".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/07/11/internet.fame/index.html |title=Internet 'gorgeous guy' admits hoax |date=2001-07-11 |work=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2008-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224002215/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/07/11/internet.fame/index.html |archivedate=2008-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human hunting''' refers to humans being [[hunting|hunted]] and killed for other persons' [[revenge]], [[pleasure]], [[entertainment]], [[Sport|sports]] or [[sustenance]]. There have been historical incidents of the practice being carried out during times of social upheaval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A 2016 report by Daniel Wright, senior lecturer in tourism at the University of Central Lancashire, predicts the hunting of the poor will become a hobby of the superrich in a future plagued by economic and ecological disasters and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Daniel |date=April–May 2016 |title=Hunting humans: A future for tourism in 2200|url=|journal=[[Futures (journal)|Futures]]|volume=78–79 |issue= |pages=34–46 |doi=10.1016/j.futures.2016.03.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical examples ==
*In Ancient Greece, the [[Spartiate|upper class]] of [[Sparta]] regularly practiced the stalking and murder of members of their servile ''[[helot]]'' population; such murders were carried out both by the secret police (''[[Crypteia]]'') as a means of keeping the helots cowed and unlikely to revolt, and as part of the military training (''[[agoge]]'') for Spartiate youths.
*During the [[Spanish Civil War]], a real-world version of this practice became popular among the sons of wealthy landowners. The hunts took place on horseback and targeted landless peasants as an extension of the [[White Terror (Spain)|White Terror]]. They were jokingly referred to as "Reforma agraria" referencing both the grave their quarry would eventually be dumped into, and the [[Background of the Spanish Civil War|land reforms]] the lower classes had been attempting to attain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spain in Our Hearts|last=Hochschild|first=Adam|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2016|isbn=9780547973180|location=New York, New York|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lavender Doe''' is the nickname given to an unidentified murder victim whose body was found in 2006 in [[Kilgore, Texas]].

The body of a [[white American|white]] or possibly Middle Eastern female between 17 and 25 years old was found on October 29, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gregg County, Texas Jane Doe|url=http://www.missinginamerica.us/apps/blog/categories/show/1575293-gregg-county-texas-jane-doe|accessdate=31 July 2014|date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kilgore, Texas]], lying face-down on a pile of burning brush.&lt;ref name=dig/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police Reconstruction images released in hopes of identifying East Texas 'Jane Doe'|url=http://www.news-journal.com/news/police/reconstruction-images-released-in-hopes-of-identifying-east-texas-jane/article_25084148-9330-11e3-92ac-001a4bcf887a.html|accessdate=31 July 2014|agency=Journal News|date=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  body was severely burnt, but clothing including a purple [[sweater]] and a pair of [[jeans]] were recovered. A total of forty [[United States dollar|dollars]] was found in her pockets.&lt;ref name=net/&gt; It is believed she died between 8:15 and 10:00 PM on the previous day.&lt;ref name="exclusive" /&gt;

Two of her [[deciduous teeth]] were still present, which may be of help in determining her identity. She weighed approximately 100 to 120 pounds, was between 5 feet 3 inches and 5 feet 5 inches tall and was most likely from a middle-class household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 2006|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1137967/1#poster|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim's hair color was likely reddish or [[blonde]] with blonde or red [[hair highlighting|highlights]], but may have been entirely strawberry-blonde or light brown.&lt;ref name=ketk&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roy|first1=Reagan|title=Authorities release 2006 'Jane Doe' reconstruction photos in hopes of identifying ETX woman|url=http://www.ketknbc.com/news/crimewatch/authorities-release-2006-jane-doe-reconstruction-p|accessdate=31 July 2014|agency=KETK News|publisher=NBC|date=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ktbs/&gt;

==Investigation==

[[File:Lavender Doe2.jpg|thumb|left|Previous reconstructions of Lavender Doe, from 2006 and 2009, respectively.]]

According to residents of the area, there were many "suspicious people" in the vicinity of the oil field where the body was discovered and some referred to the location as a "killing ground."&lt;ref name=ketk/&gt;
Because of the condition of the body, the face was [[forensic facial reconstruction|reconstructed]] three times—with clay, in a sketch by a forensic artist, and in January 2014, the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] released a digital composite image produced from a [[CT scan]] after the remains were exhumed on October 2, 2013.&lt;ref name=net&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 483UFTX|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/483uftx.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Coretta|title="Jane Doe" composition released from 2006 East Texas cold case|url=http://www.cbs19.tv/story/24691831/jane-doe-composition-released-from-2006-cold-case|accessdate=31 July 2014|agency=KTYX News|date=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Investigators seek to crack cold case|url=http://www.news-journal.com/news/local/investigators-seek-to-crack-cold-case/image_de29078e-22c5-5aa0-9dc1-5f3d1d8f5ccb.html|accessdate=31 July 2014|agency=News Journal|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite comparison with the dental records and [[DNA]] of a large number of [[missing person]]s, the search for her identity has remained fruitless.&lt;ref name=ktbs&gt;{{cite news|title=Gregg County Sheriff's Office needs help identifying 2006 burning body|url=http://www.ktbs.com/story/24692281/gregg-county-sheriffs-office-needs-help-identifying-2006-burning-body|accessdate=31 July 2014|publisher=KTBS News|date=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=journ2/&gt; After the release of the most recent reconstruction, the mother of missing 23-year-old Brandi Wells, who disappeared after going out to a [[nightclub]] in Longview, Texas in August 2006, contacted authorities, feeling the composite strongly resembled her daughter.

The '''Logan Elm''' that stood near [[Circleville, Ohio|Circleville]] in [[Pickaway County, Ohio]], was one of the largest [[Ulmus americana|American elm trees (''Ulmus americana'')]] recorded.  The {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} tree had  a trunk circumference of {{convert|24|ft}} and a crown spread of {{convert|180|ft}}.&lt;ref name=LoganElm&gt;{{cite web|title=The Logan Elm|url=http://www.over-land.com/st_loganelm.html|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Weakened by [[Dutch Elm Disease]], the tree died from storm damage in 1964.&lt;ref name=LoganElm /&gt; The [[Logan Elm State Memorial]] commemorates the site and preserves various associated markers and monuments.&lt;ref name=LoganElm /&gt;

According to tradition, [[Chief Logan]] of the [[Mingo]] tribe delivered a passionate speech at a peace-treaty meeting under this elm in 1774,&lt;ref name=LoganElm /&gt;  said to be the most famous speech ever given by a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]],{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} now known as "Logan's Lament": &lt;blockquote&gt;I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not. During the course of the last [[French and Indian War|long and bloody war]], Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, Logan is the friend of the white men. I have even thought to live with you but for the injuries of one man. [[Michael Cresap|Col. Cresap]], the last spring, in cold blood, and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of Logan, not sparing even my women and children.  There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This has called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many: I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace.  But do not harbour a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--Suppressed here as unsubstantiated, citation needed:  although some believe that the Chief's speech may have been presented there by [[Simon Girty]] on his behalf  [from 'Ulmus americana' article] --&gt;

The village of [[Logan Elm Village, Ohio|Logan Elm]] and the [[Logan Elm High School]] are located nearby.

The 29th annual celebration of the Logan Elm was held on October 5, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Circleville Union Herald|last = |first = |date = 8 October 1941|work = page 1 column 1|access-date = |via = Ohio Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among those in attendance was poet, Frank Grubbs, who recited the poem that he wrote for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Nearly 6000 at Logan Elm|last = staff|first = |date = 6 October 1941|work = |access-date = |via = family scrapbook of clippings|publisher = probably Washington Court House Record Herald|lay-source = family scrapbook of clippings from Wash.

THE LOGAN ELM

In stately majesty it stands,

Its sturdy branches spread

As if to cloister in its folds

The living and the dead;

Time and the ruthless hands of men

It mates have known,

Until it rears its hoary head

In solitude alone.

O, ancient elm! When Logan stood

Beneath thy kindly shade,

He little dreamed his eloquence

For him a shrine had made;

Tho’ many moons have waxed and waned

Since he, his story told,

The great tree flourishes as green

As in the days of old.

‘Tis said when Indian Summer blooms

Are tinting hills and downs,

The spirit of the warrior comes

Back from his “hunting grounds”

To smoke once more “the pipe of peace”

Beneath this ancient tree,

That stands a land-mark and a shrine

To the Mingo’s memory.

'''''Monitor''''' ({{IPA-sh|mǒnitor|me}}) is a weekly [[news magazine]] published in [[Podgorica]], [[Montenegro]].

Started on October 19, 1990 by university professor [[Miodrag Perović]] and businessman [[Stanislav Koprivica|Stanislav "Ćano" Koprivica]], the magazine appeared at a time when the single-party political system in [[SFR Yugoslavia]] had been abolished and its constituent republics were preparing for parliamentary elections with multiple parties. At the time, Socialist Republic of Montenegro was ruled by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist League]]'s (SKJ) [[League of Communists of Montenegro|Montenegrin branch]] (SKCG); more specifically the triumvirate of [[Momir Bulatović]], [[Milo Đukanović]], and [[Svetozar Marović]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-7896b6Qpo SKCG campaign for 1990 parliamentary elections in Montenegro - first multy-party elections]&lt;/ref&gt; who were swept into power the previous year during the [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]], an administrative putsch within Montenegrin Communist League initiated by [[Slobodan Milošević]] and carried out with the great deal of help from the state security apparatus that he controlled by this time.

==History==
The first issue of ''Monitor'' was printed in [[Sarajevo]] in 20,000 copies and then distributed in Montenegro where it sold in symbolic numbers - only couple of hundred of copies. Although the magazine listed 76 individuals as its founders (among them politicians [[Slavko Perović]], [[Jusuf Kalamperović]], [[Žarko Rakčević]], [[Ljubiša Stanković]], [[Dragiša Burzan]], [[Stevo Vučinić]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailynewsmn.wordpress.com/2009/12/18/4-120/ Miodrag Perović, dvadeset godina nakon rušenja Berlinskog zida: Crna Gora je zarobljena zemlja koja tek treba da doživi svoju 1989, projektovana da bude zemlja posluge oligarha i mafijaša, ''Monitor'', December 19, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;), in actuality only Miško Perović (editor-in-chief) and Ćano Koprivica (main financier) had actual influence on magazine's editorial policy. Following the poor sales of first issue, the magazine effectively went bankrupt and was only kept alive by individual donations. The next eight issues were also printed in Sarajevo.

Since Koprivica also generously financed [[Liberal Alliance of Montenegro]] (LSCG) and [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro]] (SDPCG), ''Monitor'' was in essence another arm of the same political front. Somewhat similar in tone and political stance to other liberal publications at the time in Yugoslavia such as ''[[Vreme]]'' from [[Belgrade]] or ''[[Feral Tribune]]'' from [[Split, Croatia|Split]], ''Monitor'' was also very critical of the rising [[nationalism]] across the country, especially of the Slobodan Milošević-led authorities in [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]]. Furthermore, it also frequently criticized the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|SR Montenegro]] communist leadership, considering them to be Milošević's pawns. As the League of Communists of Montenegro transformed into the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] (DPS) in July 1991 and the country slid into the civil war, ''Monitor'' adopted a strong anti-war stance with pointed criticism of Montenegro's involvement and effort in it through the attack on [[Konavle]] and the [[Siege of Dubrovnik]]. Managed out of a family house in Podgorica's Dalmatinska Street, the magazine intensely criticized the ruling party DPS and its leading members: Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Đukanović, Montenegrin President Momir Bulatović as well as the regime's chief ideologue and party's leader at the time Svetozar Marović. Its makeshift offices were even fire bombed during the Siege of Dubrovnik. During the same period, and especially following the creation of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] after the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 1992|1992 Montenegrin referendum]], ''Monitor'' was a strong supporter and advocate of Montenegrin independence, which even more aligned it politically and ideologically with LSCG and SDPCG.

By spring 1994, Koprivica mostly ended his financial support of ''Monitor'', which is when Miško Perović took over that aspect of running the magazine as well. Organizationally, the magazine was under the umbrella of Perović's Montenegropublic company. Although [[George Soros]] already had a prominent part in ''Monitor'''s financing through the local branch of his newly founded [[Open Society Institute]] network, this affiliation became even more pronounced after Koprivica left.

In September 1995, the magazine's place in the Montenegropublic's organizational structure got changed when it was registered within the company as a distinct entity whose managing director became [[Željko Ivanović]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailynewsmn.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/6-337/ Srđan Kusovac: Krajem 1995 započeli su realizaciju projekta “dnevni list”]; ''Pobjeda'', 25 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On the same occasion, the same was done with Montenegropublic's other assets at the time: radio station [[Radio Antena M|Antena M]] and radio production studio Mouse.

By the late 1990s most on the list of original owners signed their stake in the magazine over to Perovic who basically became the sole owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailynewsmn.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/6-327 Srđan Kusovac o stvaranju “Monitora”, Jokić: Miodrag Perović je procijenio da bi ga spor kompromitovao, jer bi se iznijela istinu o načinu na koji je stekao ogroman novac koji je kasnije, kako sam saznao uložio i u banke čija će se vrijednost mjeriti stotinama miliona eura]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas "Nick" Redfern''' (born 1964) is a British best-selling author, journalist, cryptozoologist and ufologist. Originally from the Midlands in England, Redfern now resides in Dallas, Texas in the United States.&lt;ref name="echo"&gt;{{cite news|author = Pg.20|title = There's more to what's seen in the sky than first meets the eye!|quote = |publisher = [[Express &amp; Echo]]|date = 10 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Roger Tavener|title = The X-Files; Jetliners' 30 near misses with UFOs|quote = |publisher = [[Western Daily Press]]|date = 15 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redfern is an active advocate of official government disclosure of UFO information, and has worked to uncover thousands of pages of previously classified [[Royal Air Force]], [[Air Ministry]] and [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] files on [[unidentified flying object]]s (UFOs) dating from the [[Second World War]] from the [[Public Record Office]] and currently{{When|date=January 2014}} works as a feature writer and contributing editor for ''Phenomena'' magazine.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="circuit"&gt;{{cite news|author = Recreation, Pg.5|title = Expert insight into UFOs|quote = |publisher = [[Gloucestershire Echo]]|date = 21 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nasa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = |title = The Weird and the Wonderful: New Yorkers take yoga to the dogs|quote = |publisher = [[The Nation]]|date = 8 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Peter Allen|title = Revealed - secrets of Britain's Men in Black|quote = |publisher = [[The Daily Mail]]|date = 27 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1847">The '''Old Treaty Elm''' marked the Northern boundary of the Fort Dearborn Reservation, the approximate edge of the Billy Caldwell Reserve, and the trail to Lake Geneva. The tree was located  in the [[Sauganash]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and stood until 1933.  The marker is placed several feet west of the actual location of the trunk of the tree, which stood approximately in the middle of what is now Kilbourn Avenue, just north of [[Rogers Avenue (Chicago)|Rogers Avenue]], which is the Old Indian Boundary Line.

The tree was a point of reference used in the 1836 surveying of the 1600 acre reserve.  It divided the reserve into two equal tracts containing 800 acres each.
Contrary to folklore, Billy Caldwell did not endorse the Treaty of Chicago under it.  Nor did he receive an annuity payment under it prior to moving to Platte County, Missouri in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Peter T Gayford, Billy Caldwell History, https://sites.google.com/site/chiefbillycaldwellhistory/&lt;/ref&gt;
The treaty, negotiated and signed in 1833 and enacted in 1835, ceded Indian land on the western shore of Lake Michigan to the US Government in return for land west of the Mississippi River, in what was to become Missouri.&lt;ref name="Andreas"&gt;{{Citation | last = Andreas | first = A.T. | title = History of Chicago: From the Earliest Period to the Present Time | place = Chicago, IL | publisher = A.T.

[[File:F-105D Osan Pueblo incident 1968.jpg|thumb|right|A U.S. Air Force Republic F-105D Thunderchief of the 12th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 18th Tactical Fighter Wing, at Osan Air Base, Korea, during Operation "Firefly" in 1968 that was initiated after the “Pueblo Incident”. Note that the aircraft is armed with six Mk 117 750 lb bombs and AIM-9B Sidewinder air-to-air missiles.]]
On 23 January 1968 North Korean patrol boats supported by two [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]] fighters captured the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS ''Pueblo'']] northeast of the North Korean island of [[Pansong archipelago|Ung-do]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2011), pp. 271–272.&lt;/ref&gt; The seizure of the ''Pueblo'' led to [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon Johnson]] ordering a [[show of force]] with a massive deployment of U.S. air and navy assets to Korea. The airlift and deployment of 200+ aircraft was code named '''''Operation Combat Fox'''''&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2011), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; while the deployment of six aircraft carriers plus support vessels was code named ''Operation Formation Star''.&lt;ref name="Bolger1991"&gt;Bolger (1991), Ch 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The operations were supported by the partial mobilization of reservists for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis.&lt;ref name="Bolger1991"/&gt; [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[Lockheed A-12|A-12 ''Oxcart'']] reconnaissance overflights over North Korea were used to monitor a feared retaliatory mobilization of North Korean forces and when these flights revealed no mobilization or large scale deployments by North Korean forces, ''Operation Combat Fox'' forces were stood down.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2011), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soviet response ==
Publicly, the Soviet Union responded by augmenting their naval forces in the Pacific and by sending a letter to the US president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on 3 February 1968 demanding that the United States scale back their build-up in the Sea of Japan. Privately however, [[Alexei Kosygin]] gave assurances to the US ambassador in Moscow ([[Llewellyn Thompson]]) on 6 February 1968 that the Soviet Union had no intention to go to war over Kim Il Sung's provocation. As a response to this overture, Lyndon Johnson agreed to withdraw one unnamed vessel "somewhat southward". This exchange enabled Brezhnev to make a subsequent face-saving statement to the [[23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] that the Soviet letter was answered by the Americans by withdrawing the [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'']] from DPRK's shores.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/CWIHP_WP_47.pdf pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Some Christians observe a form of the [[Jewish holidays|Jewish holiday]] of [[Passover]]. The practice is found among [[Assemblies of Yahweh]], [[Messianic Jews]], and some congregations of the [[Church of God (Seventh Day)]]. It is often linked to the Christian holiday and festival of [[Easter]]. Often, only an abbreviated ''[[Passover Seder|seder]]'' is celebrated to explain the meaning in a time-limited ceremony. The redemption from the bondage of sin through the sacrifice of Christ is celebrated, a parallel of the Jewish Passover's celebration of redemption from bondage in the land of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucg.org/litlibrary/holydays.htm The United Church of God]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Passover ceremonies are held on the evening corresponding to 14 [[Nisan]] (e.g. April 5, 2012) or 15 Nisan, depending whether the particular church uses a [[quartodecimanism|quartodeciman]] or quintodeciman application. In other cases, the holiday is observed according to the Jewish calendar on 15 Nisan, which is also used by [[Samaritan]]s.

== Meaning ==
The main Christian view is that the Passover, as observed by ancient Israel as well as Jews today, was a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of the true Passover sacrifice that was to be made by Jesus.&lt;ref name="chosenpeople1"&gt;http://www.chosenpeople.com/main/index.php/holidays-and-festivals/190-the-meaning-of-passover&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Israelites partook of the Passover sacrifice by eating it, most Christians commemorate the Jesus' death by taking part in the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]], which Jesus is said to have instituted ({{bibleverse||1Corinthians|11:15-34|}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|22:19-20|}}). Most [[Protestants]] see the elements as [[symbol]]ic of [[Body of Christ|Jesus' body]] or as symbols of the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|presence]] and or as a memorial to quicken and confirm a faith already held, while [[Roman Catholics|Roman Catholic]] and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] Christians hold that the elements are changed into Jesus' body and blood, which they then eat and drink. The Orthodox prefer to use the term, ''meteousis'' (change) rather than [[transubstantiation]] which is a Western philosophical term applied to a doctrinal concept. [[Lutherans]] describe the presence as [[sacramental union]] which means that the body and blood are "in, with, and under" the bread and wine. Anglicans believe that the bread and wine are outward and visible symbols and that "The inward and spiritual grace in the Holy Communion is the Body and Blood of Christ given to his people, and received by faith," that is as an objective presence and subjective reception.(BCP 1976. p 859). This definition most closely approximates the words of St. John of Damascus, "the bread and wine are the visible symbols of a spiritual reality."{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The spiritual theme of Passover is one of salvation by the atoning blood of a perfect, spotless sacrificed lamb.{{cn|date=July 2018}}  For many Christians, this is the spiritual pattern seen in Passover which gives it its eternal meaning and significance. The theme is carried on and brought to its ultimate [[New Covenant]] fulfillment in the sacrificial death of Christ as the promised sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:29&amp;version=ESV John 1:29]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Celebrations ==
Most Christians simply no longer celebrate the Passover, since it is seen to belong rather to a Jewish or Old Testament tradition which they believe to be no longer necessary. Among those Christians who do observe the Passover, there are some differences in how this is done. Some follow the instructions that Jesus gave to his disciples at the time of his [[Last Supper|last meal]] before he was crucified, and share instead of roasted lamb, bread (usually unleavened) and wine.&lt;ref name="ucg.org"&gt;[http://www.ucg.org/un/un0302/passover.htm How Should Christians Celebrate the Passover?]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Christian Passover service the unleavened bread is used to represent [[Body of Christ|Jesus' body]], and wine represents [[Blood of Christ|his blood]] of the [[New Covenant]] ({{bibleverse||Luke|22:19-20|}}). These are a symbolic substitute for Jesus as the true sacrificial Passover "Lamb of God" ({{bibleverse||John|1:29|1:36|}}).  It should also be noted that Passover day is followed in the Scriptures by seven days of unleavened bread ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:1-15|}}{{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:6|}}).  These days have a great dual significance to the observant Christian.  Just as leavening causes bread to be puffed up, so sin causes Christians to be "puffed up" with the sin of "malice and wickedness," and therefore must "purge out" that "old leaven" and replace it with "the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" (King James Version - {{bibleverse||1Corinthians|5:1-15|}}). Therefore, in the Christian Passover service Christ's body is represented{{Or|date=September 2007}} by unleavened bread symbolizing his sinless life, for he alone had no sin ({{bibleverse||1Peter|2:21-22|}}). Since these Scriptures indicate that during the seven days of unleavened bread, leavening represents sin and unleavened bread represents righteousness, when Christians remove leavening during these days they are reminded to put sin out of their lives.{{Or|date=September 2007}}

In some traditions, the ceremony is combined with washing one another's feet,&lt;ref name="ucg.org"/&gt; as Jesus did for his disciples the night that he suffered ({{bibleverse||John|13:5-14|}}).

Other Christians celebrate the Passover as the Jews celebrate it.  They roast and eat lamb, bitter herbs, and the unleavened Matza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wf-f.org/Seder.html Women for Faith &amp; Family]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Adventist, [[General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh-Day)|Sabbatarian Churches of God]], [[Messianic Jews]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (who call it the 'Memorial of Christ's Death') and other groups observe a Christian Passover — though all do not agree on the date(s) or the related practices.

St Thomas Syrian Christians ( Nazranis) in the malabar coast of India (Kerala) have a customary celebration of Pesaha at their homes. On the evening before Good Friday the Pesaha bread is made at home. It is made with unleavened flour and they use a sweet drink made up of coconut milk and jaggery along with this bread ( can be compared to Charoset). On the Pesaha night the bread is baked or steamed in a new vessel, immediately after rice flour is mixed with water and they pierce it many times with handle of the spoon to let out the steam so that the bread will not rise ( this custom is called " juthante kannu kuthal" in the Malayalam language meaning piercing the bread according to the custom of Jews). This bread is cut by the head of the family and shared among the family members after prayers. In some families, a creamy dip made up of jaggery and coconut milk is used along with the Peasha bread. If the family is in mourning following a death, Pesaha bread is not made at their home, but some of the Syrian Christian neighbours share their bread with them. This custom may have its origin in their probable Jewish ancestry since many other Jewish customs like separating the sexes at church, praying with veil in their heads(women), naming conventions in line with the Jewish customs, kiss of peace( kaikasthoori) in their Holy Quorbono (mass) [???!!! - "kiss of peace" is NOT a Jewish custom!!!] , presentation of their babies on the 40th day after birth in the church and  ceremonial bath of the dead bodies. Unlike other Christians, in their weddings the bride stands on the right side of the groom resembling the Jewish custom and during the wedding a veil is given to the bride&lt;ref&gt; Sunish George J Alumkalnal, Pesaha celebration of Nasranis: a sociocultural analysis.

== Date ==
Some differences between when groups observe passover are:
#Disputes over reckoning of the ''24-hour day'', for example, the modern western ''24-hour day'' begins at midnight(12:00 A.M.), whereas the biblical ''24-hour day'' is generally reckoned to begin at sunset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=167&amp;letter=D&amp;search=day Jewish Encyclopedia: Day]: "The day is reckoned from evening to evening—i.e., night and day—except in reference to sacrifices, where daytime and the night following constitute one day (Lev. vii. 15; see Calendar)."&lt;/ref&gt;
#Disputes over which day Jesus was crucified on: according to {{bibleverse||John|19:14}} and the [[Gospel of Peter]], it was the "day of preparation for the Passover", [[Nisan]] 14, also called the [[Quartodeciman]]. (John nowhere identifies the Last Supper as a Passover meal, and John 18:28 has the priests preparing to eat the Passover meal in the morning after the Last Supper.)  According to many other interpretations of the [[Synoptic Gospels]], it was the day of Passover, Nisan 15.&lt;ref&gt;[[John P. Meier]]'s ''A Marginal Jew'', vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
#Some Christians observe the celebration on the day before Passover, at the same time that Jesus held his [[Last Supper]], while others observe it at the same time that the Passover was sacrificed, that is, the time of Jesus' death, which occurred "at the ninth hour" of the day ({{bibleverse||Matthew|27:46-50|}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|15:34-37|}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:44-46|}}), or approximately 3:30 p.m, according to the Synoptic Gospels. (see [[evening]] and [[Time]] for technical reference on time).
#Still others celebrate it after sunset, at which time it would be the 15th of Nisan, the time in which the Israelites ate the Passover meal (for example see {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:8}}).
#Some Christians, out of deference for traditional Gentile Easter dates, choose to celebrate Passover, or hold Seders, on the Thursday before Easter, known as [[Maundy Thursday]], or the Last Supper observance.   These dates vary among Hebrew, Gregorian, and Julian calendars, and they vary between Western (e.g. Roman Catholic) and Eastern Orthodox (e.g. Greek Orthodox) traditions.  (There is also a school of thought [WHOSE?] that the Last Supper may have been on the Tuesday night, with most passion week "sabbath" references in the Gospels referring to a Thursday holy day of rest ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:6-7 ... WHICH SAYS NO SUCH THING: NO "THURSDAY HOLY DAY OF REST!" |}}) instead of to the traditional Saturday main sabbath.  Contrast Mark 16:1 after the weekday day of rest with Luke 23:56-24:1 before the weekend sabbath.)
It was a question of defilement that gave rise to the words: “They themselves did not enter into the governor’s palace, that they might not get defiled but might eat the passover.” (Joh 18:28) These Jews considered it a defilement to enter into a Gentile dwelling. (Ac 10:28) This statement was made, however, “early in the day,” hence after the Passover meal had taken place. It is to be noted that at this time the entire period, including Passover day and the Festival of Unfermented Cakes that followed, was at times referred to as “Passover.” In the light of this fact, Alfred Edersheim offers the following explanation: A voluntary peace offering was made on Passover and another, a compulsory one, on the next day, Nisan 15, the first day of the Festival of Unfermented Cakes. It was this second offering that the Jews were afraid they might not be able to eat if they contracted defilement in the judgment hall of Pilate.—The Temple, 1874, pp.&amp;nbsp;186, 187

==Christian history regarding the Passover==

===Christian tradition - the passover finished===
Apollinaris and [[Melito of Sardis]] were both 2nd century writers that wrote about the end of Christian celebration of the Jewish Passover.

[[Melito]]'s ''[[Peri Pascha]]'' ("On the Passover") is perhaps the most famous early document concerning the Christian non-observation of Passover.

{{quote|For indeed the law issued in the gospel–the old in the new, both coming forth together from Zion and Jerusalem; and the commandment issued in grace, and the type in the finished product, and the lamb in the Son, and the sheep in a man, and the man in God...For at one time the sacrifice to the sheep was valuable, but now it is without value because of the life of the Lord. The death of the sheep once was valuable, but now it is without value because of the salvation of the Lord. The blood of the sheep once was valuable, but now it is without value because of the Spirit of the Lord. The silent lamb once was valuable, but now it has no value because of the blameless Son. The temple here below once was valuable, but now it is without value because of the Christ from above… Now that you have heard the explanation of the type and of that which corresponds to it, hear also what goes into making up the mystery. What is the passover? Indeed its name is derived from that event–"to celebrate the passover" (to paschein) is derived from "to suffer" (tou pathein). Therefore, learn who the sufferer is and who he is who suffers along with the sufferer...This one is the passover of our salvation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kerux.com/documents/KeruxV4N1A1.asp On The Passover, by Melito of Sardis — vs. 7, 44, 46, 69a]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Apollinaris Claudius|Apollinaris]] wrote:
{{quote|There are, then, some who through ignorance raise disputes about these things (though their conduct is pardonable: for ignorance is no subject for blame — it rather needs further instruction), and say that on the fourteenth day the Lord ate the lamb with the disciples, and that on the great day of the feast of unleavened bread He Himself suffered; and they quote Matthew as speaking in accordance with their view.  Wherefore their opinion is contrary to the law, and the Gospels seem to be at variance with them. … The fourteenth day, the true Passover of the Lord; the great sacrifice, the Son of God instead of the lamb, who was bound, who bound the strong, and who was judged, though Judge of living and dead, and who was delivered into the hands of sinners to be crucified, who was lifted up on the horns of the unicorn, and who was pierced in His holy side, who poured forth from His side the two purifying elements, water and blood, word and spirit, and who was buried on the day of the passover, the stone being placed upon the tomb&lt;ref&gt;"Apollinaris." From the ''Book Concerning Passover''. Translated by Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson. Excerpted from Volume I of The Ante-Nicene Fathers (Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, editors); American Edition copyright © 1885. Copyright © 2001 Peter Kirby.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Excommunication for celebrating passover===
Christians who kept the biblical Passover were considered [[Quartodeciman]] because they kept Passover on the 14th day of [[Nisan]]. [[Polycrates of Ephesus]], was a late 2nd  century leader who was excommunicated (along with all Quartodecimans) by Pope Saint [[Pope Victor I|Victor]] for observing the Christian Passover on the 14th of Nisan and not switching it to a Sunday resurrection celebration.  He, Polycrates, claimed that he was simply following the practices according to scripture and the Gospels, as taught by the Apostles John and Philip, as well as by church leaders such as [[Polycarp]] and [[Melito of Sardis]].

According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, neither Jesus Christ nor the early church leaders changed the Passover celebration to Easter, "In fact, the Jewish feast was taken over into the Christian Easter celebration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05224d.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Easter]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This  article concerns the Belgian government prize. For similarly named prizes aimed at other countries' nationals, see [[Prix de Rome (disambiguation)]].''

[[File:Medailleverso.jpg|thumb|right|Prize medal received by [[Constant Montald]] in 1886]]
The Belgian '''Prix de Rome''' ({{lang-nl|Prijs van Rome}}) is an award for young artists, created in 1832, following the example of the original French [[Prix de Rome]]. The [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp]] organised the prize until 1920, when the national government took over. The first prize is also sometimes called the '''Grand Prix de Rome'''. There were distinct categories for painting, sculpture, architecture and music. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==History==
The Prix de Rome was a [[scholarship]] for arts students. It was created in 1663 in [[France]] under the reign of [[Louis XIV]]. It was an annual burse for promising artists (painters, sculptors, and architects) who proved their talents by completing a very difficult elimination contest. The prize, organised by the [[Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] (''Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture''), was open to their students. The award winner would win a stay at the [[Palazzo Mancini]] in [[Rome]] at the expense of the King of France. The stay could be extended if the director of the institution deemed it desirable.

Expanded after 140 years into five categories, the contest started in 1663 as three categories &amp;mdash; [[painting]], [[sculpting]], and [[architecture]]; in 1803, [[music]] was added; in 1804, [[engraving]] was added. The winner of the "First Grand Prize" (called the ''agréé'')&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms. Michael Clarke. Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; would be sent to [[French Academy in Rome|The Academy of France in Rome]] founded by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] in 1666. In 1807, [[Louis Napoleon]] created the [[Prix de Rome (Netherlands)|Dutch version]] of the Prix de Rome. After the creation of Belgium as an independent state in 1830, the Belgian government started their own version of the Prix de Rome in 1832. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The {{Nihongo|'''Sapporo Snow Festival'''|さっぽろ雪まつり|Sapporo Yuki-matsuri}} is a festival held annually in [[Sapporo]], Japan, over seven days in February. [[Odori Park]], [[Susukino]], and [[Tsudome]] are the main sites of the festival.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of the largest and most distinctive winter events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snowfes.com/english/useinfo/history_e.html History of the Sapporo Snow Festival, English page] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120630021321/http://www.snowfes.com/english/useinfo/history_e.html |date=30 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 (57th Festival), about two million people visited Sapporo to see the hundreds of snow statues and ice sculptures at the Odori Park and Susukino sites, in central Sapporo, and at the Satoland site.&lt;ref name=outline&gt;[http://www.snowfes.com/contents/about/outline.html The outline of the Sapporo Snow Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013201403/http://www.snowfes.com/contents/about/outline.html |date=13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An International Snow Sculpture Contest has been held at the Odori Park site since 1974, and 14 teams from various regions of the world participated in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snowfes.com/english/contest/index.html International Snow Sculpture Contest, English page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513214048/http://www.snowfes.com/english/contest/index.html |date=13 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of the statues varies and often features an event, famous building or person from the previous year. For example, in 2004, there were statues of [[Hideki Matsui]], the famous [[baseball]] player who at that time played for the [[New York Yankees]]. A number of stages made out of snow are also constructed and some events including musical performances are held. At the Satoland site, visitors can enjoy the long snow and ice slides as well as a huge maze made of snow. Visitors can also enjoy a variety of regional foods from all over [[Hokkaidō]] at the Odori Park and Satoland sites, such as fresh seafood, potatoes and corn, and fresh dairy products.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Every year the number of statues displayed is around 400 in total.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In 2007, there were 307 statues created at the [[Odori Park]] site, 32 at the Satoland site and 100 at the Susukino site. A good view of the creations can be had from the TV Tower at the Odori Park site.&lt;ref name=outline/&gt;

==History==
The Snow Festival began as a one-day event in 1950, when six local high school students built six snow statues in Odori Park. In 1955 the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] from the nearby Makomanai base joined in and built the first massive [[snow sculpture]]s, for which the Snow Festival has now become famous. Several snow festivals existed in Sapporo prior to the Sapporo Snow Festival, however, all of these were suspended during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;Sapporo Board of Education. "''Sapporo Bunko No.47''" Hokkaidō News Bureau, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 1966, a flight from Sapporo to Tokyo [[All Nippon Airways Flight 60|crashed into Tokyo Bay]] killing all 126 passengers and 7 crew on board. Many of the passengers were returning to Tokyo after visiting the snow festival. Owing to the [[Energy crisis]] of 1974, snow statues were built using [[Drum (container)|drums]]. This was due to the shortage of gasoline caused by the crisis and many of the [[truck]]s used to carry snow to the site were unavailable. In the same year, the International Snow Statue Competition started and since that year many snow statues built by teams from other countries have featured; especially from [[sister cities]] of Sapporo such as [[Sapporo#Sister cities|Munich]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In years when the accumulated snowfall is low, the Self-Defense Force, for whom participation is considered a training exercise, brings in snow from outside Sapporo. The Makomanai base, one of three main sites from 1965,&lt;ref name=Yukimatsurihist&gt;[http://www.snowfes.com/contents/about/history.html History of the Sapporo Snow Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; hosted the largest sculptures, with an emphasis on providing play space for children. Use of the Makomanai site was suspended in 2005 and moved to the [[Sapporo Satoland]] site located in [[Higashi-ku, Sapporo|Higashi-ku]] from 2006. In 2009, the Satoland site was moved to the {{nihongo|Tsudome|つどーむ|Tsudōmu|[[Sapporo Community Dome]]}} site. The Tsudome, located close to the Sapporo Satoland, is a dome for multiple sports events.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Nakajima Park was established as one of the festival sites in 1990. However, it was removed as a site in 1992.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The third site, known as the {{nihongo|Susukino Ice Festival|すすきの氷の祭典|Susukino Kōri no Saiten}}, is situated in the night-life district of [[Susukino]] and includes predominantly ice carvings. The site was approved as one of the festival sites in 1983.&lt;ref name=Yukimatsurihist/&gt; Every year, the Susukino Queen of Ice, a female [[beauty contest]], is held at the site.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2037">'''Skanifest''' was a [[Punk rock|punk]], [[ska]] and [[Rock music|rock]] festival organized in [[Ciney]], [[Belgium]] from 2005 until 2009. The festival's aim was to host rock, ska and punk bands at fair prices. The Skanifest [[ASBL]] (non-profit organisation) was dissolved in 2010.

Each year, Skanifest tried to mix local groups starting out, more experienced local bands and artists with national, or even international, experience.

'''''Real Carlos''''' was a 112-gun three-decker [[ship of the line]] built at [[Havana|Havanna]] for the [[Spanish Navy]] in 1787 to plans by [[Romero Landa]]. One of the eight very large ships of the line of the ''[[Spanish ship Santa Ana|Santa Ana]]'' class, also known as ''los Meregildos'', ''Real Carlos'' served in the Spanish Navy during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and was destroyed with heavy loss of life during the [[Second Battle of Algeciras]].

==Construction==
The ''Santa Ana'' class was built for the Spanish fleet in the 1780s and 1790s as heavy ships of the line, the equivalent of [[Royal Navy]] [[first rate]] ships. The other ships of the class were the [[Spanish ship Santa Ana|''Santa Ana'']],  [[Spanish ship Mexicano (1786)|''Mexicano'']], [[Spanish ship Salvador del Mundo (1787)|''Salvador del Mundo'']], [[Spanish ship Conde de Regla (1786)|''Conde de Regla'']], [[Spanish ship San Hermenegildo (1789)|''San Hermenegildo'']], [[Spanish ship Reina María Luisa (1791)|''Reina María Luisa'']] and ''[[Spanish ship Príncipe de Asturias (1794)|Príncipe de Asturias]]''. Three of the class were captured or destroyed during the French Revolutionary Wars.
  
==History==
In 1793 the ''Real Carlos'' was under the command of [[Baltasar Sesma y Zaylorda]] as the flagship of Admiral [[Francisco de Borja]]. Borja led an expedition to [[Sardinia]], capturing the islands of [[San Pietro Island]] for Spain and [[Sant'Antioco]] for France.

On 8 April 1799, ''Real Carlos'' was flagship of the [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] squadron under [[Francisco Melgarejo]], alongside ''[[Spanish ship Argonauta|Argonauta]]'', ''[[Spanish ship Monarca (1794)|Monarca]]'', ''[[Spanish ship San Agustín (ship)|San Agustín]]'', ''[[Spanish ship Castilla (1780)|Castilla]]'' and three smaller ships. This squadron sailed in an effort to unite with the French Atlantic Fleet operating in the ''[[Croisière de Bruix]]'', but missed the rendezvous and spent much of the rest of the year at anchor in [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], returning on 11 September. The following year ''Real Carlos'' participated in repelling the British [[Ferrol Expedition (1800)|Ferrol Expedition]].

By July 1801, ''Real Carlos'' was at [[Cádiz]]. When a French squadron defeated a British force at the [[First Battle of Algeciras]] on 6 July, ''Real Carlos'' joined the squadron sent to escort the French from [[Algeciras]] back to Cádiz. During the night of 12 July the combined force was returning through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] when a British squadron attacked them at the [[Second Battle of Algeciras]]. During the confused night action which followed, [[HMS Superb (1798)|HMS ''Superb'']] cut through the rearguard and between ''Real Carlos'' and ''San Hermenegildo''. The Spanish ships opened fire, striking one another, as a fire spread across ''Real Carlos''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s decks. In the darkness the two huge Spanish ships collided, fire spreading out of control until both exploded in a fireball that could be seen from shore. More than 1,700 men were killed in the blast, one of the greatest losses of life at sea to that time.

'''Summer Darkness''' is an alternative music festival in the [[Netherlands]] which was held annually from 2003 to 2013, around the second weekend in August in the city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. Over the years its popularity has grown considerably.

==Organisation==
Summer Darkness is organised similar to [[Germany]]'s [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]], albeit on a much smaller scale. Acts perform in various clubs throughout the city of Utrecht. The main stages are [[Tivoli (Utrecht)|Tivoli]] Oudegracht, Tivoli de Helling and EKKO. There are also individual performances at the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht|Domkerk]] and Leeuwenbergh church. Side events include a market, city tours and exhibitions by [[LARP]] groups.
The festival was a joint venture by Cybercase, [[Tivoli (Utrecht)]], EKKO and [[Mojo Concerts|Mojo]] until EKKO made the decision in 2009 to quit.

There have been some minor events held under the banner of Summer Darkness. For instance since 2007 there have been several "Summer Darkness - Winter Edition" events.

In 2014 the festival will be taking a [[sabbatical]] from the usual summer edition, traditionally held in the last weekend of July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=50732_0_2_0_C Summer Darkness Festival takes a sabbatical] February 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015 it was announced the festival would no longer be organised, as explained on the festival website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summerdarkness.nl/index.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Suzuki Swift Sport Cup''' is a [[One-Design|one-make racing]] series in [[New Zealand]]. The series is made up of [[Suzuki Swift]]'s sourced through Winger Motor Group in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[Waikato region]]. The series is designed to be an inexpensive way for young drivers to get into [[touring car racing|tin-top racing]]. Built on the standard production [[Suzuki Swift Super 1600]] with class rules set by Motor Sport New Zealand, the cars are race-modified to set specifications to ensure even competition.

==Previous championship winners==
The championship first started in 2007/08, when the championship ran alongside the [[New Zealand Production Championship]]. In 2009/10, the series became its on championship running separate races from the Production Championship.

In the series' short history, there has only ever been one two-time winner; Cody McMaster in 2007/08 and 2008/09.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swiftcup.co.nz/launch2.0/roundsresults_0708.php |accessdate=January 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604231822/http://www.swiftcup.co.nz/launch2.0/roundsresults_0708.php |archivedate=June 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swiftcup.co.nz/launch2.0/roundsresults_0809.php |accessdate=January 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604231805/http://www.swiftcup.co.nz/launch2.0/roundsresults_0809.php |archivedate=June 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==V8SuperTourer Support Category==
In 2013, the championship will go from supporting the [[New Zealand V8s]] in the summer, to supporting the [[V8SuperTourer]] series in a year-long series. This will help with the development of the young driver, and increase the opportunity for young drivers to reach the top level of motorsport in New Zealand. Drivers who graduate the Swift Cup, can now easily step into the V8 Challenge Cup to develop their V8 skills before stepping into the V8SuperTourer. Former Swift Cup driver Mark Gibson is currently following this path.

The deal with [[V8SuperTourer]] will see the Suzuki's not running on [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] tyres for the first time in the series history. They will be changing over to [[Hankook Tire|Hankook]] tyres.

'''''The Little Rascals''''' is a 30-minute [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning animated series]] produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] and [[King World Productions]]. It first aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on September 25, 1982. A [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] based on the live-action ''[[Our Gang]]'' comedy shorts, it was broadcast as part of ''[[The Pac-Man/Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show]]'' in 1982 and then as part of ''[[The Monchhichis/Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show]]'' in 1983.

The characters were designed by [[Iwao Takamoto]] and [[Bob Singer]] by using tracing paper on top of actual photographs of the real-life characters, and used a pencil to sketch the characters.  The same technique was also used in previous Hanna-Barbera spin-offs such as ''[[Fonz and the Happy Days Gang]]'' and ''[[Laverne and Shirley in the Army]]''.

==Overview==

===Previous ''Little Rascals''/''Our Gang'' animated television programs===
''The Little Rascals'' had been animated for television twice before. In the 1960s, a series of nine clay-animated ''Little Rascals Color Specials'' were produced for syndication, presumably by Bura &amp; Hardwick, the British studio responsible for ''[[Camberwick Green]]'', using soundtracks from the original ''Our Gang'' films. The episodes include "[[Shiver My Timbers]]", "[[Our Gang Follies of 1936]]", "[[Second Childhood (film)|Second Childhood]]", "[[Hearts Are Thumps]]", "[[Came the Brawn]]", "[[Bear Shooters]]", "[[Readin' and Writin']]", "[[The Pinch Singer]]", and "[[Teacher's Beau]]". {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1979, [[Fred Wolf (animator)|Fred Wolf]] produced an animated ''[[The Little Rascals Christmas Special]]'' for [[NBC]]. That company's version was further used in animated [[public service announcement]]s.

===Differences between the animated series and the live-action ''Our Gang'' films===
The animated series and the original live-action ''Our Gang'' films differ in a number of ways. The gang now lives in a contemporary 1980s setting, with [[computer]]s and [[television]], which could be assumed that these were the descendants of the original Little Rascals. Buckwheat is now a clever [[inventor]] and is interested in science, always creating new devices for the gang, and Darla's eyes were changed from hazel to blue (although this detail was trivial given that all of the ''Our Gang'' shorts were in black-and-white). Also in the animated series, the Rascals met in a treehouse and drove around the town of Greenpoint in a dog-drawn vehicle. Also, the [[theme music]] was completely different.

==Lawsuit==
In March 1984, ''Our Gang'' actor [[Eugene Gordon Lee|Eugene Lee]], who had played Porky in the original theatrical short films as a child from 1935 to 1939, sued Hanna-Barbera Productions for nearly $2 million, claiming that the animated character was a violation of his likeness rights. He was joined in the lawsuit by other former ''Our Gang'' kids: [[George McFarland]], who had played Spanky, [[Tommy Bond]], who had played Butch, and [[Sidney Kibrick]], who had played The Woim. [[Carl Switzer]], [[Darla Hood]] and [[Billie Thomas]], who had played Alfalfa, Darla and Buckwheat respectively were already deceased. It was found that Hanna-Barbera's license from King World did not include the likeness rights of the former child actors, and the case was settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgAfDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Trial+by+Fire:+One+Man%27s+Battle+to+End+Corporate+Greed+and+Save+Lives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwicv5X5qLnTAhWLOyYKHSiGCBAQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=spanky&amp;f=false |title=Trial by Fire: One Man's Battle to End Corporate Greed and Save Lives |last=Burg |first=Mike |publisher=BenBella Books, Inc. |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast==
The animated series of ''The Little Rascals'' has been shown in the following regions:
* United States ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], original broadcaster)
* Atlantic Canada ([[CTV Two Atlantic|ASN]], later rebranded as CTV Two Atlantic)
* Latin America ([[Cartoon Network Latin America]])
* United Kingdom ([[Cartoon Network UK &amp; Ireland]])
* Ireland ([[RTÉ Television|Telefís Éireann]])
* France ([[Antenne 2]]/France 2, called ''Les Petite Canailles'')
* Germany ([[Boomerang (Germany)|Boomerang Germany]])
* Australia ([[Seven Network]])
* Singapore ([[MediaCorp Channel 5]])
* New Zealand ([[TVNZ 2]])

The French dub, ''Les Petites Canailles'', replaced the original theme music with a new theme song, performed by a chorus of children over a montage of clips from both the theatrical ''Our Gang'' shorts and the animated shorts.

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Trademark infringement''' is a violation of the [[exclusive right]]s attached to a [[trademark]] without the authorization of the trademark owner or any licensees (provided that such authorization was within the scope of the licence). Infringement may occur when one party, the "infringer", uses a trademark which is identical or [[confusing similarity|confusingly similar]] to a trademark owned by another party, in relation to products or services which are identical or similar to the products or services which the registration covers. An owner of a trademark may commence civil [[lawsuit|legal proceedings]] against a party which infringes its registered trademark. In the United States, the [[Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984]] criminalized the intentional trade in counterfeit goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Irina D. Manta Spring 2011 [http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v24/24HarvJLTech469.pdf The Puzzle of Criminal Sanctions for Intellectual Property Infringement] Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology 24(2):469-518&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|485–486}}

If the respective marks and products or services are entirely dissimilar, trademark infringement may still be established if the registered mark is well known pursuant to the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]]. In the United States, a cause of action for use of a mark for such dissimilar services is called [[trademark dilution]].

In some jurisdictions a party other than the owner (e.g., a licensee) may be able to pursue trademark infringement proceedings against an infringer if the owner fails to do so.

== Factors ==
Courts consider various factors in order to determine whether a trademark was infringed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-30|title=Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rescuecom_Corp._v._Google_Inc.&amp;oldid=807804980|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/13859|title=Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.|website=h2o.law.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whether the plaintiff has a valid trademark. A trademark can be valid because it is officially registered, or because it has a claim under common law.
* Whether the trademark is being used by the defendant. 
* Whether the defendant's use of the mark is "in commerce."
* Whether that use is connected to the sale, offer, distribution, or advertising of a product. 
* Whether the defendant's use of the trademark is likely to confuse consumers. 
This last factor, consumer confusion, is the main topic of debate in most cases. 

=== Consumer Confusion ===
Where the respective marks or products or services are not identical, similarity will generally be assessed by reference to whether there is a '''likelihood of confusion''' that consumers will believe the products or services originated from the trademark owner.

Likelihood of confusion is not necessarily measured by actual [[consumer confusion]] if two products do not directly compete against each other but are in proximate markets. Then, to determine consumer confusion, a court may apply one of various factor tests. The primary test comes from [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] and is found in ''AMF, Inc v. Sleekcraft Boats'', 599 F.2d 341 (C.A.9) 1979.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Court there announced eight specific elements to measure likelihood of confusion:
# Strength of the mark
# Proximity of the goods
# Similarity of the marks
# Evidence of actual confusion
# Marketing channels used
# Type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser
# Defendant's intent in selecting the mark
# Likelihood of expansion of the product lines&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/amf.htm AMF, Inc v Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341 (C.A.9) 1979]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.ce9.uscourts.gov/jury-instructions/node/244|title=15.18 Infringement—Likelihood of Confusion—Factors—Sleekcraft Test {{!}} Model Jury Instructions|website=www3.ce9.uscourts.gov|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm|title=Overview of Trademark Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/polaroid.htm|title=Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elect. Corp., 287 F.2d 492 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 820 (1961).|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Courts have fashioned their own tests for likelihood of confusion—like those announced in ''In re E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co''., 476 F.2d 1357, 177 USPQ 563 (CCPA 1973)'',''&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-11th-circuit/1413742.html IN RE E.I. DuPONT DE NEMOURS &amp; COMPANY-BENLATE LITIGATION], 476 F.2d 1357 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; known collectively as the [[United States trademark law|''DuPont'' factors]].

== Defenses ==
The party accused of infringement may be able to defeat infringement proceedings if it can establish a valid ''exception'' (e.g., comparative advertising) or ''defence'' (e.g., [[Laches (equity)|laches]]) to infringement, or attack and cancel the underlying registration (e.g., for non-use) upon which the proceedings are based. Other defenses include [[Genericide|genericness]], functionality, [[Abandonment of trademark|abandonment]], or [[Fair use (U.S. trademark law)|fair use]]. 

== Globally ==
The [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|ACTA trade agreement]], signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the EU, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to actively police for infringement.&lt;ref name="Bitton"&gt;Miriam Bitton (2012) [http://www.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/backissues/v102/n1/1021_67.Bitton.pdf Rethinking the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement’s Criminal Copyright Enforcement Measures] The Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 102(1):67-117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ige.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/Juristische_Infos/e/transparency_paper.pdf|title=The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement – Summary of Key Elements Under Discussion|date=November 6, 2009|work=transparency paper|publisher=Swiss federation of Intellectual Property|format=pdf|accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xuan_p211"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bN3o1uwpKF4C&amp;dq=copyright+infringement+international+acta&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Intellectual property enforcement: international perspectives|last=Correa|first=Carlos Maria|author2=Li, Xuan|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84844-663-2|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries (but not in countries like the United States, which recognizes common law trademark rights), a trademark which is ''not'' registered cannot be "infringed" as such, and the trademark owner cannot bring infringement proceedings. Instead, the owner may be able to commence proceedings under the common law for [[passing off]] or [[misrepresentation]], or under legislation which prohibits [[unfair business practices]]. In some jurisdictions, infringement of [[trade dress]] may also be actionable.

== Notable cases ==
* ''[[Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc.]]'', case still pending
* ''[[Google, Inc. v. American Blind &amp; Wallpaper Factory, Inc.]]'', in which Google's AdWords program was alleged to be in violation of trademark
* ''[[Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.]]'', in which the use of trademarks in Google's AdWords program was found to be a "use in commerce" under the Lanham Act
* ''[[Network Automation, Inc. v. Advanced Systems Concepts, Inc.]]'', in which the use of a competitor's trademark as an Internet advertisement search keyword was found to not constitute trademark infringement
* ''[[College Network, Inc. v. Moore Educational Publishers, Inc.]]'', in which the use of a competitor's trademark does not qualify as a "use in commerce" is upheld
* ''[[Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elects.]]''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3787">'''''Treasures of the Underworld''''' was an exhibition featured in the [[New Zealand]] pavilion of [[Seville Expo '92]]. 

==The exhibition==

The exhibition featured 48 works, comprising a total of 399 individual pieces. It was extremely successful with over half a million visitors to New Zealand's Pavilion, making it the most-visited exhibition of New Zealand art to that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lloyd-Jenkins|first1=Douglas|last2=Hammond|first2=Lucy|title=Crafts and applied arts - Craft in the 1990s|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/crafts-and-applied-arts/page-9|website=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=24 January 2015|date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The exhibition was curated by the art curator [[James Mack]] and featured commissions completed by New Zealand's top practitioners of object art in glass and clay at that time. 

The artists who contributed works were:

*[[Len Castle]]
*[[Ann Robinson (artist)| Ann Robinson]]
*[[Steve Fullmer]]
*[[Ann Verdcourt]]
*[[Darryl Robertson]]
*[[Christine Boswijk]]
*[[Richard Parker (potter)| Richard Parker]]
*[[Barry Brickell]]
*[[Paerau Corneal]]
*[[Brian Gartside]]
*[[Julia van Helden]]
*[[Christine Hellyar]]
*[[Chester Nealie]]
*[[Robyn Stewart]]

==Exhibition theme==

The theme of the commissions was the celebration of the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's first voyage to America. This emphasis on voyage and discovery influenced the artists to explore the connections with New Zealand and the familiar world of the South Pacific. [[James Mack]] urged each artist to stretch both materials and technique beyond Eurocentric influences. 

==Influence==

The interest the works generated came as a surprise. [[Ian Fraser (broadcaster)|Ian Fraser]] the Commissioner at the NZ Expo said &lt;blockquote&gt;We were overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the response....&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christchurchartgallery.org.nz/Bulletin/96/Bulletin96.pdf The Robert MccDougall Art Gallery Bulletin No. 96 June/July 1995] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016112650/http://www.christchurchartgallery.org.nz/Bulletin/96/Bulletin96.pdf |date=2008-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The work produced for this exhibition has and continues to influence the development of object art in New Zealand. The success of the exhibition also boosted the profile of ceramic and glass artists in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lloyd-Jenkins|first1=Douglas|last2=Hammond|first2=Lucy|title=Crafts and applied arts - Craft in the 1990s|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/45327/treasures-of-the-underworld-seville-expo-92|website=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=24 January 2015|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a personal request from Queen Beatrice of Holland, the exhibition toured to Die Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam, Holland, before returning to New Zealand for a nationwide tour.

After the tours were complete the artworks were accessioned into the permanent collection of the New Zealand National Art Gallery - now the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].

'''USS ''Tautog'' (SSN-639)''', a [[Sturgeon class submarine|''Sturgeon''-class]] [[attack submarine]], was the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for the [[Tautog]] (''Tautoga Onitis''), a [[wrasse]] commonly found along the Northern Atlantic coast. The submarine was in service from 17 August 1968 to 31 March 1997.

== Construction and commissioning ==
[[File:639 christening.jpg|thumb|left|''Tautog'' Commissioning]]
The contract to build ''Tautog'' was awarded to [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]] in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]], on 30 November 1961 and her [[keel]] was laid down there on 27 January 1964.  She was commissioned on 15 March 1967, sponsored by [[Pauline Lafon Gore]], wife of [[United States Senator]] [[Albert Gore, Sr.]] (1907–1998) of [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; Under sunny skies, a crowd of thousands watched as Mrs. Gore took a hearty swing with a bottle of champagne and intoned the memorial words, "In the name of the United States of America, I christen thee Tautog."{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=Quotation is not cited, but plausible.}}  ''Tautog'' was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] 17 August 1968 under the command of [[Commander]] Buele G. Balderston.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

== Service history ==

=== 1968–1970 ===
On 30 August 1968, ''Tautog'' departed Pascagoula on her way to join the [[United States Pacific Fleet]].  She transited the [[Panama Canal]] on 8 September 1968 and arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, on 23 September 1968.  There, she joined Submarine Squadron 12, serving as its [[flagship]].  Throughout 1969, ''Tautog'' completed her post-commissioning tests and [[sea trial]]s, followed by her [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] training cruise.  She conducted the majority of these operations in the vicinity of the [[Hawaiian Islands]], although in January and February 1969 she berthed in [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] at [[Bremerton, Washington]], for trials and repairs.  She completed her shakedown training in September 1969 and, on 15 September 1969, began post-shakedown repairs and alterations which were protracted by the necessity of replacing her entire [[diesel generator]].  ''Tautog''{{'}}s repairs finally were completed on 19 February 1970, and she began normal operations out of Pearl Harbor, involving [[torpedo]] and [[sonar]] tracking exercises,&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; culminating in ''Tautog'' earning the Battle Efficiency "E" in 1970 for outstanding performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/archpdf/ah197011.pdf |title= FY 1970 Battle Efficiency Awards |journal= All Hands |issue= November 1970 |page= 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tautog'' received a Navy Unit Commendation for service on or about 1 June 1969.&lt;ref name="Unit Awards" /&gt; According to Drew, 2008, ''Tautog'' monitored a test of new cruise missiles launched from an [[Echo class submarine|Echo II class]] Soviet submarine in the summer of 1969.&lt;ref name="Drew, 2008" /&gt;

[[File:639 launch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Tautog'' Launch]]

''Tautog'' sailed with the Seventh Fleet (Western Pacific, or WESTPAC) in 1970, making port calls in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Okinawa, Japan and Korea.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; Upon return to Pearl Harbor, ''Tautog'' was presented the Meritorious Unit Commendation for operations conducted during that deployment, 1 October 1970 to 1 April 1971.&lt;ref name="Unit Awards" /&gt;

=== Collision with ''K-108'', 1970 ===
On 20 June 1970, ''Tautog'' was patrolling the [[North Pacific Ocean]] near the city of [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]], on the [[Soviet Union]]{{'}}s [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], which was a major base for [[missile]]-armed [[submarine]]s of the [[Soviet Navy]].  ''Tautog'' was attempting to trail the ''K-108'', a Soviet Navy [[Echo class submarine|Echo II-class]] [[guided missile submarine]] nicknamed "Black Lila". The Soviet submarine was "close aboard" with ''Tautog'', unaware that ''Tautog'' was in the vicinity, and the two submarines were within feet of one another for a lengthy period. Unable to determine the depth of the ''K-108'', as new depth-finding hydrophones had not yet been installed, the American submarine was at a disadvantage in such close quarters. At some points the hydrographic equipment aboard ''Tautog'' registered zero distance between the submarines. At another point "Tautog's" hydrophone operators assumed the ''K-108'' had risen to near the surface, placing the Soviet submarine directly above ''Tautog''. Then the operators determined the Soviet vessel was descending. The trace on the oscilloscope, that gave the American submariners at visual reference as to the distance of the ''K-108'', disappeared.  Just as the captain began to say the Soviet sub was coming close aboard again, ''K-108'' slammed belly first into the top of the ''Tautog's'' sail, proof the Soviet vessel had been descending from directly above. The ''K-108's'' massive screws came into contact with the steel of the ''Tautog's'' sail and lost one screw. This was confirmed by hydrographic sound of a turbine running away aboard the Soviet sub, being no longer coupled to a propeller.&lt;ref&gt;"Sonntag, Sherry, and Drew, Christopher, ''Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story Of American Submarine Espionage'', p. 146. New York, PublicAffairs Publishers, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;''Tautog'' suffered damage to her [[Sail (submarine)|sail]].  As ''Tautog'' proceeded away from the site of the accident, her crew heard what they believed was ''K-108'' breaking up and sinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19930329&amp;id=9cdGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M_gMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5005,5942042&amp;hl=en |title= Greenpeace: Russia lacks means to safely mothball nuclear subs |newspaper= The Day |date= 19 March 1993 |page= B6 |location= New London, CT |first= Terry |last= Atlas |agency= Chicago Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Tautog'' arrived in Pearl Harbor, a large portion of one of ''K-108''{{'}}s [[Propeller|screws]] was found embedded in her sail.  Over thirty years later, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was revealed that ''K-108'' had actually been able to return to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The former captain of the K-108, Boris Bogdasaryan, was able to provide a concise narrative of the collision. The collision resulted in no casualties aboard either submarine.

[[File:639 San Francisco.jpg|thumb|left|''Tautog'' sailing into San Francisco]]

Even though the occurrence of this event was adamantly denied by the United States and the Soviet Union, the ''Tautog''{{'}}s sail was permanently bent at a 2° angle, which made dry-docking problematic.

In 1991, the Chicago Tribune broke the story about the collision.  Discovery Channel mentioned it in their TV program ''Sharks of Steel'', and the full details were finally made public in 1999 in the book ''Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story Of American Submarine Espionage''.&lt;ref name="Drew, 2008"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=845kaNoYqy4C&amp;pg=PT252#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story Of American Submarine Espionage |page= 250 |chapter= 7 |publisher= PublicAffairs |year= 2008 |first= Christopher |last=Drew |first2= Sherry |last2= Sontag |ISBN= 978-1-58648-678-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970–1977 ===
On 9 October 1970, ''Tautog'' departed Pearl Harbor for her first East Asian deployment.  She arrived on station at [[Buckner Bay]], [[Okinawa]], on 23 October 1970 and joined the [[United States Seventh Fleet]].  During her tour of duty in the [[Western Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]], she was completely engaged in [[antisubmarine warfare]] training, usually with units of the Seventh Fleet but, on one occasion, in a joint operation with the British [[Royal Navy]] [[frigate]] [[HMS Aurora (F10)|HMS ''Aurora'' (F10)]].  She spent time in port for liberty and repairs at such places as [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay]] in the Philippines; Hong Kong; [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]], Japan; and the South Korean port of [[Pusan]]. She concluded her first tour of duty in the Western Pacific on 28 March 1971 when she departed Yokosuka bound for Hawaii.  She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 5 April 1971 and resumed her routine of upkeep in port alternated with periods at sea engaged in antisubmarine warfare training for the remainder of 1971 and during the first three months of 1972.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

[[File:639 Subic Bay.jpg|thumb|right|''Tautog'' in Subic Bay, Philippines]]

On 21 March 1972, ''Tautog'' put to sea for a special operation.  During that mission, she called briefly at [[Guam]] and at Subic Bay.  At the conclusion of the assignment, ''Tautog'' earned the Navy Unit Commendation for operations conducted during that deployment, 1 June 1972.&lt;ref name="Unit Awards"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://awards.navy.mil |title= Unit Awards for USS Tautog |publisher= US Navy |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20041014224730/https://awards.navy.mil/ |archivedate= 14 October 2004 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tautog'' made a liberty visit to Hong Kong before returning via Guam to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 31 August 1972. She conducted operations in the Hawaiian Islands for the remainder of 1972.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

On 15 January 1973, ''Tautog'' entered the [[Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard]] for her first regular overhaul. It was completed on 15 April 1974, when she resumed local operations out of Pearl Harbor which – except for a voyage to the [[Pacific Northwest]] which lasted from late July to early September 1974 – occupied her time until the beginning of May 1975.  [[File:Tautog1974.jpg|thumb|USS Tautog near unnamed city in 1974]]  On 3 May 1975, she departed Pearl Harbor for another series of special operations in the Central Pacific and Western Pacific.  That voyage included a period in [[drydock]] at Guam during the first week in June 1975 as well as exercises in the Philippines near Subic Bay.  Ports of call once again included Subic Bay and Hong Kong but no South Korean or Japanese ports.  ''Tautog'' returned to Pearl Harbor on 18 October 1975 and resumed her schedule of training and upkeep.  The officers and crew were awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for the successful completion of their assigned mission.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason= No awards listed for 1975}}

=== 1977–1980 ===
Attack submarine training, independent ship{{'}}s exercises, inspections, and evaluations, all conducted in the Hawaiian Islands operating area, consumed ''Tautog''{{'}}s energies through the end of 1976.  She did not deploy overseas again until the beginning of 1977, when she got underway for a goodwill visit to [[Mombasa, Kenya]].  Departing Pearl Harbor on 3 January 1977, she reached Mombasa on 24 January 1977 and remained there for a month while her crew saw the sights and she received visitors on board.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/e/enterprise-cvan-65-viii-1976-1980.html |title= USS Enterprise |publisher= history.navy.mil |quote= Attack submarines Scamp (SSN-588) and Tautog (SSN-639) "contributed greatly" to evaluations of the SH-3D, S-3A and TSC as an "ASW team".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Uganda crisis, 1977 ====
''Tautog'' departed Mombasa on 24 February 1977 and started east toward Pearl Harbor.  On the way, however, [[President of Uganda]] [[Idi Amin]] had precipitated a crisis by rounding up all Americans resident in Uganda in response to President of the United States [[Jimmy Carter]]{{'}}s condemnation of the murders of two of Amin{{'}}s Ugandan political opponents, and ''Tautog'' received orders to join a hastily organized [[task force]] built around the nuclear-powered [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65}} and return to the East African coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.public.navy.mil/airfor/enterprise/Documents/Enterprise/1977.pdf |title= USS Enterprise 1977 Command History |page= 6 |date= April 1978 }}. Details the measures taken to conduct a covert rendezvous with ''Enterprise''.&lt;/ref&gt; While the United States waited for Amin to make his mind up about whether or not to release the American hostages, ''Tautog'' cruised the coast of Kenya, which stands between landlocked Uganda and the Indian Ocean, with the ''Enterprise'' task force both as a show of American resolve to protect U.S. citizens in Uganda and as a scratch force to try for a hostage rescue if one became necessary.&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/tautog-ii.html |title= Tautog II }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tautog'' received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for service 1 November 1976 to 5 July 1977.&lt;ref name="Unit Awards" /&gt;

[[File:639 Pearl Harbor.jpg|thumb|right|''Tautog'' sailing into Pearl Harbor]]

Amin eventually freed the hostages, and ''Tautog'' was released from the special task force and resumed her voyage east, arriving at Guam on 19 March 1977.  ''Tautog'' visited [[Chinhae]], South Korea, in April and, on 20 April 1977, arrived in Subic Bay for a series of special operations in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Early in May 1977, ''Tautog'' made a liberty call at Hong Kong and then returned to Subic Bay on the 18 May.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; Special operations occupied her time in late May and in June.  On 3 July 1977, she arrived back at Pearl Harbor&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; and began a customary post-deployment standdown to allow the crew to rest and recuperate.

During the 1977 WESTPAC deployment, her crew enjoyed such liberty ports as Mombasa (Kenya), Guam, Chin Hae (South Korea), the Philippines, and Hong Kong. Upon return to Pearl Harbor, preparations were made for the transit to Vallejo, California, where ''Tautog'' would undergo its second major overhaul and receive a new reactor core. In December 1977 ''Tautog'' entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard and the overhaul commenced.

Following completion of the standdown on 8 August 1977, ''Tautog'' conducted local operations in the Hawaiian area until she departed Pearl Harbor on 2 December 1977 to proceed to the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] at [[Vallejo, California]], for an overhaul.  This [[Refueling and Overhaul|overhaul, which included the refueling]] of her nuclear core, lasted nearly fifteen months, after which ''Tautog'' successfully completed her sea trials and sailed to Pearl Harbor to rejoin the Submarine Force arriving in July 1979.

=== 1980–1997 ===

Following an intense{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2017}} period of training and operational exercises, ''Tautog'' again deployed on WESTPAC in March 1980. ''Tautog'' met every commitment placed on her during this period of international tension, and was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal&lt;ref name="Unit Awards" /&gt; for her performance. In September 1980, the ship was awarded the Battle Efficiency "E",&lt;ref name="Unit Awards" /&gt; Anti Submarine Warfare "A" and Engineering "E" for excellence displayed during the previous year. Port visits to Diego Garcia; the Philippines; Perth, Australia; and Guam were enjoyed by all hands. ''Tautog'' also received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for service on or around 1 June 1980.&lt;ref name="Unit Awards" /&gt;

[[File:639 ice surface.jpg|thumb|left|''Tautog'' surfaced in Arctic]]

1981 found the ship and crew rested and ready to go. After a vigorous{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2017}} training cycle, ''Tautog'' sailed west once more in support of the Seventh Fleet in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. She became the first nuclear submarine to transit the Malacca Straits, surfaced and visited Singapore, the Philippines, Australia, Diego Garcia and Japan. Later in 1982 ''Tautog'' earned her third consecutive Engineering "E" and a Damage Control "DC" for excellence in Engineering and Damage Control.

In winter 1982, ''Tautog'' joined one of her sister ships, the USS ''[[USS Aspro (SSN-648)|Aspro]],'' and journeyed to the frozen reaches of the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/a/aspro-ii.html |title= Aspro II}}&lt;/ref&gt; She operated beneath the ice pack for two months and conducted a dual surfacing maneuver at the [[North Pole]] with [[USS Aspro (SSN-648)|USS Aspro]]. It was said to be the second rendezvous by two U.S. submarines at the pole and the first during winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/archpdf/ah198312.pdf |title= Rendezvous at the North Pole |first= Mel |last= Sundlin |journal= All Hands |issue= December 1983 |pages= 20–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During summer 1983, ''Tautog'' once again found herself operating under the Arctic ice pack. To celebrate her arrival at the Pole, the crew had a picnic, a tug-of-war and dog sled races "around the world".{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

[[File:639 North Pole 2.jpg|''Tautog'' surfaced at North Pole|thumb|right]]

In 1984, following a two-month shipyard availability, ''Tautog'' entered a vigorous operational crew training period. In the spring of 1984, ''Tautog'' again journeyed west in support of Seventh Fleet operations. ''Tautog'' operated extensively in the Northern Pacific, making port visits to the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], and Japan. Again, ''Tautog'' was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=No awards listed for 1984}}

''Tautog'' completed a Western Pacific deployment in November 1984 upon her return to [[Pearl Harbor]].  After completing a standdown and a post-deployment upkeep period, she hosted [[prospective commanding officer]] operations in February 1985 and spent a three-day liberty period at [[Lahaina, Hawaii]], on [[Maui]].

[[File:639 Diamond Head.jpg|thumb|left|''Tautog'' sailing in front of Diamond Head, Hawaii]]

In the summer of 1985 ''Tautog'' joined the attack submarine {{USS|New York City|SSN-696}} in hosting [[prospective commanding officer]] operations.

In October 1985, ''Tautog'' left Pearl Harbor for a Western Pacific and Indian Ocean deployment, visiting [[Guam]]; Singapore (for Christmas); [[Diego Garcia]] twice; [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Australia; the Philippines; and [[Chinhae]], South Korea.  On her return to Pearl Harbor ''Tautog'' picked up an [[Operational Reactor Safeguard Examination]] team.

During the Tautog's time in Subic Bay, Ferdinand Marcos was deposed as President of the Philippines and Corazon Aquino was declared the new president. Tautog finished its refit and continued on to finish its WestPac.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Once back in Pearl Harbor in April 1986, ''Tautog'' had a change of command ceremony in which Commander Walter P. Stuermann relieved Commander T. R. Kent as [[commanding officer]].

In October 1986, ''Tautog'' began a non-refueling overhaul at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]], [[Bremerton, Washington]]. After extensive modifications and testing, ''Tautog'' returned to her homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 30 May 1989.

''Tautog'' departed on her eighth Western Pacific deployment in May 1990 visiting Singapore, Hong Kong, [[Subic Bay]] (Philippines), and [[Yokosuka, Japan]]. The ship experienced a massive [[typhoon]] which prevented her from entering Subic Bay for almost a week.

Back in Pearl Harbor in November 1990, ''Tautog'' enjoyed the holidays and began preparing for her third arctic deployment. In April 1991 ''Tautog'' once again joined her sister ship, the USS ''Aspro''for three weeks of Arctic under-ice operations, ending in a liberty port in San Francisco. After the exercise, ''Tautog'' performed an emergency main ballast tank blow from her test depth.

In summer 1991, ''Tautog'' hosted the [[Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force|JMSDF]] submarine ''[[Yūshio class submarine|Akishio]]'' on her mid-Pac cruise.  Several members of both crews shared in each other's culture, and some former members of each crew are still in contact.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

During the 50th-anniversary remembrance observances of 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor by the [[Japanese Empire]], ''Tautog'' held the honor of being the showcase submarine, hosting many distinguished World War II veterans.

In late January 1992, ''Tautog'' successfully fired a MK 48 Advanced Capability warshot [[torpedo]] and laid the diesel submarine ex-''Darter'' to rest in the deep waters just south of [[Oahu]].

[[File:Darter1.jpg|thumb|right|Torpedo explodes under ''Darter'']]

In summer 1992, ''Tautog'' set sail on a WESTPAC deployment where she pulled back-to-back operations totaling approximately 150 days at sea of the approximate 180-day deployment.

In October 1993, ''Tautog'' was sent on an emergent WESTPAC with four days notice. The ship and crew participated in a joint exercise with the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force, then enjoyed a liberty port in Hong Kong.  On 3 October, ET2(SS) Pitcher lost a year of his age when the Tautog sailed across the International Date Line shortly after midnight.  This incident is known as:  The Great October International Date Line Demarcation Incident.

In February 1995, ''Tautog'' departed Pearl Harbor for her eleventh WESTPAC deployment conducting joint operations with Japanese, Korean and British naval forces. During this deployment the crew was still able to enjoy such liberty ports as Guam, Hong Kong, Yokosuka (Japan), [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] (Japan), [[Okinawa]] (Japan), [[Chinhae]] (South Korea), and Subic Bay (Philippines). ''Tautog'' was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for the highly successful completion of this cruise.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=Award for 1995 not listed on Unit award website.}}

Misfortune arrived in February 1996 while the ''Tautog'' was conducting a personnel transfer in the mouth of Pearl Harbor.  Unusual winds blowing from Maui caught the sail and ''Tautog'' drifted off course.  While the Officer of the Deck was trying to reposition her, she ran into the west bank of the harbor.  The damage was slight – cracking the sonar dome – but it was still a ship grounding incident and a board of inquiry was launched to determine the root cause of the incident.

[[File:639 Decom.jpg|thumb|left|''Tautog'' decommissioning]]

In July 1996, ''Tautog'' departed on her final deployment, this time to the eastern Pacific, supporting weapons testing and weeks of daily Midshipman orientation cruises. Liberty ports included [[San Diego]] and [[Esquimalt]] ([[British Columbia]]), with a repair stop in [[Bangor, Washington]].

''Tautog'' made her last dive on Sunday, 13 October 1996, her 1119th dive.

''Tautog''{{'}}s inactivation ceremony was held on 25 October 1996. After an inactivation period of approximately 6 months, ''Tautog'' departed her lifelong homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii for the final time, en route to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for final disposition.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Decommissioning and disposal ==

''Tautog'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] on 31 March 1997 and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] the same day. Her scrapping via the U.S. Navy{{'}}s Nuclear-Powered [[Ship and Submarine Recycling Program]] at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton began on 15 March 2003 and was completed on 30 November 2004.

== Commemoration ==
''Tautog''{{'}}s sail was preserved and is now on display at [[Seawolf Park]] in [[Galveston, Texas]]. {{Coord|29.3342|N|94.7782|W|display=inline,title}}). It suffered damage when [[Hurricane Ike]] struck the area in 2008.

'''Mostra di Architettura di Venezia''', the architecture section of the [[Venice Biennale]], was established in 1980, although architecture had been a part of the art biennale since 1968.

As well as addressing the academic side of architecture, the Biennale provides an opportunity for architects and designers to showcase new projects, arranged in different pavilions, each with different themes. The Architecture Biennale is currently held in the [[Biennale Gardens]].

The '''Versailles wedding hall''' ({{lang-he|אולמי ורסאי}}), located in [[Talpiot]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], was the site of the most lethal civil disaster in [[Israel]]'s history. At 22:43 on May 24, 2001, during the wedding of Keren and Asaf Dror, a large portion of the third floor of the four-story building collapsed. As a result, 23 people fell to their deaths through two stories, including the groom's 80-year-old grandfather and his three-year-old second cousin, the youngest victim. Another 380 were injured, including the bride who suffered serious pelvic injuries that required surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1356398.stm |title=Wedding survivors recall night of horror |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=18 February 2017 |date=28 May 2001 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asaf, who escaped serious injury,  carried her in his arms from the rubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1353808.stm |title=Courage of the survivors |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=18 February 2017 |date=26 May 2001 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disaster shocked the [[Israel|Israeli]] public not only because it was one of the worst building disasters in the country's history, but because the event was documented on a [[camcorder]] and broadcast on local and international television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/24/newsid_4530000/4530071.stm |title=2001: Israel wedding party tragedy |date=24 May 2008 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=18 February 2017 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rescue efforts ==
Rescue efforts were carried out by the Home Front Command's [[Bahad 16|Search &amp; Rescue Unit]] and the [[Yachtza]] reserve unit. Rescue efforts commenced immediately after the collapse and continued until 4pm on Saturday May 26, 2001. Three people were pulled from the rubble alive, and 23 bodies were removed.

== Investigation ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2012}}
An investigation of the event concluded that the event was not caused by a [[terrorist attack]]. This was based on the testimony provided by many of the wedding guests present in the building during the disaster. Witnesses reported seeing a dangerous sag in the floor moments before the collapse. An initial inquiry blamed the collapse on the [[Pal-Kal]] &lt;small&gt;([[:he:פל קל|he]])&lt;/small&gt; method of constructing light-weight coffered concrete floor systems which was banned shortly after the completion of the wedding hall since it was known and proven to be unsafe. Further review pointed to a combination of two alternative causes.

Initially, the side of the building that failed was designed to be a two-story structure, while the other side was designed to be three stories. Late in the construction process, it was decided that both sides of the building should be equal heights, and a third story was added to the shorter side. However, the [[live load]] due to occupancy is typically much greater than the design load for a roof. As a result, the structure supporting the new third story was subjected to much greater loading than was originally anticipated. The effect of this error was somewhat mitigated by the construction of partitions on the floor below, which helped redistribute the excess load well such that no damage was incurred.

A few weeks before the collapse, the wedding hall owners decided to remove the partitions. With the load path eliminated, the floor above began to sag several centimetres. The owners viewed the sagging floor primarily as a cosmetic problem, and attempted to level it with additional grout and fill. However, their approach not only failed to provide additional structural capacity, it also inadvertently introduced a new and significant [[dead load]] at the weakened area.

During the wedding event in 2001, this significantly overstressed floor section failed, resulting in the catastrophe. The [[engineer]] Eli Ron, inventor of the Pal-Kal method of construction, was arrested and subsequently indicted in August 2002 on the charge of [[manslaughter]]. Ron had not engaged in any part of the design or construction, but had sold proprietary elements necessary for construction that were installed in a deficient manner.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Versailles Law ==
Following the disaster, the "Versailles Law" was passed by the [[Knesset|Parliament of Israel]]. This law established a special committee responsible for treating the people injured in the disaster. Moreover, an official investigation committee was established by the then Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] under the leadership of the former judge [[Vardimos Zeiler]] &lt;small&gt;([[:he:ורדימוס זיילר|he]])&lt;/small&gt;, who was in charge of the security of public places and buildings. The Zeiler Committee on Building Safety investigated both the Versailles wedding hall collapse as well as the [[Maccabiah bridge collapse]] which occurred four years earlier in 1997, and released its final report in December 2003.

In October 2004, the three owners of Versailles wedding hall — Avraham Adi, Uri Nisim, and Efraim Adiv – were convicted of causing death by negligence and causing damage by negligence. Adi and Adiv were sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment while Nisim was sentenced to four months of community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel/Versailles-hall-owners-sentenced |title=Versailles hall owners sentenced |last=Lefkovits |first=Etgar |date=6 November 2005 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |access-date=18 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wedding hall was subsequently demolished, and as of 2017 the site remained unoccupied and sealed. Across the street from the site is a memorial garden with names of victims inscribed on a wall.

In May 2007, Eli Ron and three engineers involved in the building's construction were sentenced to prison by the Jerusalem District Court. Eli Ron received a four-year sentence, Shimon Kaufman and Dan Sheffer 22 months, and Uri Pessah six months. In December 2006, the court convicted all three men of causing death by negligence and sabotage by negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.4823345 |title=Versailles Wedding Hall Engineer Jailed for 23 Negligent Deaths |last=Hasson |first=Nir |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |access-date=18 February 2017 |date=31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial garden to the victims was built near the disaster site.

'''Way On Cemetery''' is a [[burial place]] in [[Panama City]] for the country's [[Chinese people|Chinese]] community, many of whose ancestors immigrated during the construction of the [[Panama Railroad]] in the mid-nineteenth century. The plot was purchased in 1882 by the Sociedad Way On and designed in accordance with [[feng shui]] and [[numerology]] traditions. Construction began the next year, and the first interment was in 1911. In 1942, due to a shortage of burial places in the city, half of the property was forcibly leased by the government, but it was returned to the Chinese community in 2002. Today, traditional [[Tomb Sweeping]] ceremonies are held annually and funeral ceremonies are performed regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_13/issue_07/community_02.html |title=Grave cleaning day in Panama City's Chinese cemetery|newspaper=The Panama News|accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its stone wall enclosures and towering entrance gate, Way On has suffered from vandalism in recent years, and faces ongoing threats due to development pressures and lack of site maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/project/way-on-cemetery|title=Way On Cemetery|publisher=World Monuments Fund|accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was included on the [[2012 World Monuments Watch]] and is classified as "Rescue Needed" by [[Global Heritage Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghn.globalheritagefund.org/explore.php?id=1370 |title=GHN Sites|publisher=Global Heritage Fund |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Web Standards Project''' ('''WaSP''') was a group of professional web developers dedicated to disseminating and encouraging the use of the [[web standards]] recommended by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]], along with other groups and standards bodies.

Founded in 1998, The Web Standards Project campaigned for standards that reduced the cost and complexity of development while increasing the [[Web accessibility|accessibility]] and long-term viability of any document published on the Web. WaSP worked with browser companies, authoring tool makers, and peers to encourage them to use these standards, since they "are carefully designed to deliver the greatest benefits to the greatest number of web users".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.webstandards.org/about/mission/| title = WaSP: Fighting for Standards (WaSP mission statement)| accessdate = 2008-03-10| year = 2006| publisher = Web Standards Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the project was closed.

==Organization==

The Web Standards Project began as a grassroots coalition "fighting for standards in our [web] browsers" founded by George Olsen, [[Glenn Davis (web design)|Glenn Davis]], and [[Jeffrey Zeldman]] in 1998. By 2001, the group had achieved its primary goal of persuading Microsoft, Netscape, Opera, and other browser makers to accurately and completely support HTML 4.01/XHTML 1.0, CSS1, and ECMAScript. Had browser makers not been persuaded to do so, the Web would likely have fractured into pockets of incompatible content, with various websites available only to people who possessed the right browser. In addition to streamlining web development and significantly lowering its cost, support for common web standards enabled the development of the semantic web. By marking up content in semantic (X)HTML, front-end developers make a site's content more available to search engines, more accessible to people with disabilities, and more available to the world beyond the desktop (e.g. mobile).

Founding members of the project moved on in 2002 but continued to evangelize web standards to design and business audiences. In this period, the Web Standards Project became primarily an educational organization.

Project leaders were:
* [[George Olsen (web developer)|George Olsen]] (1998–1999)
* [[Jeffrey Zeldman]] (1999–2002)
* [[Steven Champeon]] (2002–2004)
* [[Molly Holzschlag]] (2004–2006)
* [[Kimberly Blessing]] and Drew McLellan (2006–2008)
* [[Derek Featherstone]], [[Aaron Gustafson]], and [[Glenda Sims]] (2008–2013)

There were members that were invited to work on ad hoc initiatives, the [https://www.webstandards.org/buzz/ Buzz Blog] and other content areas of the site.

The group announced its own dissolution in a Buzz Blog post on March 1, 2013.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Task forces ===
The Web Standards Project hosted projects focused on bringing relevant organizations closer to standards-compliance, dubbed Task Forces.

;Adobe Task Force: Focused on improving web standards compliance in products from [[Adobe Systems]]. Was named the [[Adobe Dreamweaver|Dreamweaver]] Task Force until 2008-03-10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webstandards.org/2008/03/10/announcing-the-adobe-task-force/ Announcing the Adobe Task Force - The Web Standards Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Education Task Force : Worked with institutions of higher [[education]] to promote instruction of Web standards and standards-compliant public sites.
; Microsoft Task Force: Worked with the [[Internet Explorer]] and Web platform tools team.
; Accessibility Task Force: Worked with organizations, vendors and others to promote Web accessibility.
; International Liaison Group: A member was "an active advocate for Web standards and best practices either in their [[country]] of origin or domicile."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webstandards.org/action/ilg/members/|title=ILG Members - The Web Standards Project|work=webstandards.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; The Street Team: Organized community events to promote web standards.
;DOM Scripting Task Force: Focused on interoperable [[client-side scripting]], through explaining and promoting the [[Document Object Model|DOM]] standards from W3C and the [[ECMAScript]] Standard, and concepts like [[progressive enhancement]], [[graceful degradation]] and [[unobtrusive scripting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webstandards.org/action/dstf/manifesto/|title=Manifesto - The Web Standards Project|work=webstandards.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These best practice approaches have been called [[DOM scripting]] to differentiate them from earlier perceived bad uses of [[Dynamic HTML|DHTML]]. The task force became inactive before the group disbanded.

== Activities ==
* The [[Acid1]] test allows browsers and other rendering engines to test compliance with HTML 4 and CSS 1 specifications.
* The [[Acid2]] test allows browsers and other rendering engines to test compliance with [[CSS]] 1 and 2 specifications.
* The [[Acid3]] test allows browsers and other rendering engines to test compliance with CSS 2.1, [[Document Object Model|DOM]], and [[EcmaScript]] specifications.
* The Acid4 test, to be created at a later date, will allow browsers and other rendering engines to test compliance with [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], CSS 3, and mixed namespaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[Ian Hickson]]|first1=|title=Acid4 will be primarily a visual test, not especially scripted. It will likely focus on the following specifications and areas|url=http://www.hixie.ch/tests/evil/acid/004/|website=hixie.ch|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the WaSP's closure, the status of this test is unknown.

The phrase "'''What would Jesus do?'''" (often abbreviated to '''WWJD''') became popular, particularly in the United States but elsewhere as well, in the 1990s and as a personal [[motto]] for adherents of [[Christianity]] who used the phrase as a reminder of their belief in a [[moral imperative]] to act in a manner that would demonstrate the love of Jesus through the actions of the adherents.&lt;ref name=BBCnews&gt;{{cite web|title=What would Jesus do?: The rise of a slogan|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16068178|website=www.bbc.com/news/|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HelmekeSori2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helmeke|first1=Karen B.|last2=Sori|first2=Catherine Ford|title=The Therapist's Notebook for Integrating Spirituality in Counseling I|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=9781135884710|page=150|quote=In recent years, largely among Protestant and Catholic circles, the catch phrase "What Would Jesus Do" has become popular. The phrase is an attempt to call people to consider how Jesus Christ might respond to personal situations in daily life.

Bracelets, keychains, T-shirts, bumper stickers, and other items initialized with WWJD have become commonplace.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular consciousness, the acronym signifying the question—WWJD—is associated with a type of bracelet or wristband which became a popular accessory for members of Christian youth groups, both Catholic and Protestant, in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=BBCnews/&gt;&lt;ref name="HelmekeSori2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWJD What Would Jesus Do Bracelets|url=http://www.mortaljourney.com/2010/11/1990-trends/wwjd-bracelets|publisher=Mortal Journey|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Theological background===
{{see|Christian perfection|Imitatio Dei|Holiness movement}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] emphasizes the concept of ''Imitatio Christi'' ([[imitation of Christ]]), which is summarized well in the English phrase "What Would Jesus Do?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2011/02/what_would_jesu.html|title="What Would Jesus Do?": A History|last=Rothman|first=Josh|date=8 February 2011|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|language=English|accessdate=27 December 2016|quote="What would Jesus do?" has its roots, Shore explains, in the tradition of imitatio Christi - that is, of imitating the life of Christ. In this tradition, which dates back to early Christianity, a true believer might imitate Jesus by giving to the needy, traveling to the Holy Land, or, in the case of Saint Francis of Assisi, "receiving the stigmata, the bodily marks of Christ's suffering." Imitatio Christi encouraged Christians to "do as Jesus did."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wesley]], the founder of the [[Methodist Church]], in 1766 postulated the concept of [[Christian perfection]], a moment in the life of a Christian at which the [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] effectuated by the [[Holy Spirit]] results in a "perfection in love" which means that at least at that moment one is being motivated wholly by [[Great Commandment|love of God and neighbor]], with no taint of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] or ulterior motives in effect. While such Christian perfection is expressed in outward action, it is also the effect of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]]. Indeed, Wesley could speak of [[sanctification]] by faith as an analogous doctrine to the more widely held belief in [[justification by faith]]. Because Christian perfection is also visible in outward [[good works]] and a rigorously moral lifestyle, adherents of the [[Holiness movement]] assumed that a perfectly moral lifestyle is a consequence (not the cause) of the [[State (theology)|state of grace]] and ultimate [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]].

===Earlier appearances of the term, 1420s–1891===
[[Charles Spurgeon]], a well-known evangelical preacher in London, used the phrase "what would Jesus do" in quotation marks several times in a sermon he gave on June 28, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Sermon no. 2210. Spurgeon.org {{cite web|last1=Spurgeon|first1=Charles|title=The Agreement of Walking by Faith|url=https://archive.spurgeon.org/sermons/2210.php|website=Spurgeon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his sermon he cites the source of the phrase as a book written in Latin by [[Thomas à Kempis]] between 1418 and 1427, ''Imitatio Christi'' (The Imitation of Christ).

===1896 novel===
[[Charles Sheldon]]'s 1896 book ''[[In His Steps]]''  was subtitled "What Would Jesus Do?"&lt;ref name=BBCnews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon, C. (1896). [http://www.jr-miller.com/other/sheldon/in-his-steps.html ''In His Steps''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107084725/http://www.jr-miller.com/other/sheldon/in-his-steps.html |date=2012-11-07 }}. First published by the ''Chicago Advance'' in serial form.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sheldon's novel grew out of a series of sermons he delivered in his [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] church in [[Topeka, Kansas]]. Unlike the previous nuances mentioned above, Sheldon's theology was shaped by a commitment to [[Christian Socialism]]. The [[ethos]] of Sheldon's approach to the [[Christian]] life was expressed in this phrase "What Would Jesus Do", with Jesus being a moral example as well as  a Saviour figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kshs.org/research/collections/documents/personalpapers/findingaids/sheldon_charles.htm Charles Monroe Sheldon/Central Congregational Church Collection, 1811-1984].&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon's ideas coalesced with those that formed into the [[Social Gospel]] espoused by [[Walter Rauschenbusch]]. Indeed, Rauschenbusch acknowledged that his Social Gospel owed its inspiration directly to Sheldon's novel,&lt;ref name=FloridaCara&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Burnidge |first=Cara L. |date=Spring 2009 |title=Charles M. Sheldon and the Heart of the Social Gospel Movement |type=M.A. |publisher=Florida State University |url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:180988/datastream/PDF/view |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110154107/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:180988/datastream/PDF/view |archive-date=November 10, 2016 |dead-url=no |access-date=June 2, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sheldon himself identified his own [[theology]] with the Social Gospel.&lt;ref name=FloridaCara/&gt;

Due to a mistake by the original publisher, the copyright for Sheldon's novel was never established and multiple publishers were able to print and sell the novel. This caused the novel to be easily affordable and it sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the top 50 bestselling novels ever.&lt;ref name=BBCnews/&gt;

In this popular novel (it had been translated into 21 [[language]]s by 1935), Rev. Henry Maxwell encounters a [[homelessness|homeless]] man who challenges him to take seriously the imitation of [[Jesus|Christ]]. The homeless man has difficulty understanding why, in his view, so many Christians ignore the poor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I heard some people singing at a church prayer meeting the other night,

"All for Jesus, all for Jesus,
All my being's ransomed powers,
All my thoughts, and all my doings,
All my days, and all my hours."

and I kept wondering as I sat on the steps outside just what they meant by it. It seems to me there's an awful lot of trouble in the world that somehow wouldn't exist if all the people who sing such songs went and lived them out. I suppose I don't understand. But what would Jesus do? Is that what you mean by following His steps? It seems to me sometimes as if the people in the big churches had good clothes and nice houses to live in, and money to spend for luxuries, and could go away on summer vacations and all that, while the people outside the churches, thousands of them, I mean, die in tenements, and walk the streets for jobs, and never have a piano or a picture in the house, and grow up in misery and drunkenness and sin."&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon, C. (1896) ''In His Steps,'' p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This leads to many of the novel's characters asking, "What would Jesus do?" when faced with decisions of some importance. This has the effect of making the characters embrace Christianity more seriously and to focus on what they see as its core &amp;mdash; the life of Christ.

In 1993, Garrett W. Sheldon (great-grandson of the original author) and Deborah Morris published ''What Would Jesus Do? : a contemporary retelling of Charles M. Sheldon's classic In His Steps''. Garrett Sheldon states that his updated version "is based on many actual events in the lives of believers."&lt;ref&gt;Garrett W. Sheldon with Deborah Morris, ''What Would Jesus Do? : a contemporary retelling of Charles M. Sheldon's classic In His Steps'' (1993), p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that Sheldon was familiar with either Spurgeon or Thomas, or that he was independently inspired.

===1990s===

FROG was an acronym for "Fully Rely On God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FROG bracelets answer WWJD question|journal=Pentecostal Evangel|date=1999|issue=4417–4442|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
In 2005, Garry Wills wrote "What Jesus Meant", in which he examined "What Would Jesus Really Do" (also a book review in ''[[Esquire Magazine]]'').

===2010===
In April 2010 a film, ''WWJD'', starring [[Adam Gregory]] and based on ''In His Steps'' by Charles Sheldon, was released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Would Jesus Do?|url=https://www.amazon.com/What-Would-Jesus-John-Schneider/dp/B003UCA4XI|website=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 31 March 2015 a sequel film was released ''WWJD What Would Jesus Do? The Journey Continues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWJD What Would Jesus Do? The Journey Continues (2015)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4123718/|website=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second film using the moniker ''WWJD II'' was ''The Woodcarver'' which was released in 2012. It has a similar theme but different characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Woodcarver (2015)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2047890/|website=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parodies==
The expression has become a [[snowclone]], sometimes for humorous effect. For example, ''[[What Would Jesus Buy?]]'', "What Would [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] Do?", "[[What Would Brian Boitano Do?]]", "What Would [[Mary Marvel]] Do?", "What Would [[Johnny Cash]] Do?", and "What would [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] do?".&lt;ref&gt;A small book investigating Tintin as a role model for young people. http://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/title/2796&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management and leadership==

The term "What Would Jesus Do?" or "WWJD" is also perceived as a fundamental management and leadership principle given Jesus' methodology of going to the marketplace to preach and lead by example. In modern management principles, more academic and professional references are going to the [[gemba]] or [[Management by Walking Around]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e.globis.jp/article/000240.html|title=MBA Buzz: Pope Francis and the Rebuilding of the Catholic Culture |accessdate=2013-06-11 |author=King del Rosario |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Winterbourne View hospital inquiry occurred at Winterbourne View, a private hospital at [[Hambrook]], [[South Gloucestershire]], England, owned and operated by Castlebeck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companiesintheuk.co.uk/ltd/caring-homes-healthcare-group |title=GA HC REIT II CH U.K. SENIOR HOUSING PORTFOLIO LIMITED, SW1H 0AD 21 PALMER STREET Financial Information |website=Companiesintheuk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] investigation broadcast on television in 2011, exposed the [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]] suffered by people with [[learning disabilities]] and [[challenging behaviour]] at the care home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=21:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011pwt6 |title=BBC One - Panorama, Undercover Care: The Abuse Exposed |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}

Local social services and the English national regulator ([[Care Quality Commission]]) had received various warnings but the mistreatment continued. One senior nurse, Terry Bryan, reported his concerns to the management at Winterbourne View and to CQC, but his complaint was not taken up.&lt;ref name="systematic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-14181646 |title=Winterbourne View 'failed to protect people' - BBC News |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public funded hospital has been shut down as a result of the abuse that took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-13891855 |title=Winterbourne View 'abuse' hospital closes on Friday - BBC News |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abuse==
The undercover footage showed staff repeatedly assaulting and harshly restraining patients under chairs. Staff gave one patients cold punishment showers, left her outside in near zero temperatures, and later poured mouthwash into her eyes. They pulled patients' hair and forced medication into patients' mouths. Victims were shown screaming and shaking, and one patient was seen trying to jump out of a second floor window to escape the torment, and was then mocked by staff members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-20084254 | title=Winterbourne View: Abuse footage shocked nation | publisher=BBC | accessdate=30 October 2012 | date=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One patient was repeatedly [[Eye poke|poked in the eyes]].&lt;ref name="reporter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9501000/9501531.stm | title=Undercover reporter 'haunted' by abuse of patients | publisher=BBC | accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clinical psychologist who reviewed the footage described the abuse as "torture".&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13548222 | title=Four arrests after patient abuse caught on film | publisher=BBC | accessdate=30 October 2012 | date=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
On 21 June 2011, 86 people and organisations wrote to the Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]] about the revelations, "We are aware of the various actions currently being taken within and outside government – such as the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|DH]] review and CQC internal inquiry. We hope to make submissions to those both individually and collectively. However, on their own these will not be enough and a clear programme is needed to achieve change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ann McCallum |url=http://www.dimensions-uk.org/news-and-events/response-to-winterbourne-view-interim-report/ |title=Experts available for comment - Dimensions |website=Dimensions-uk.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prime minister responded saying he was “appalled” at the “catalogue of abuses” Panorama uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndti.org.uk/news/archive-news/news-stories-from-2011/prime-minister-responds-to-letter-demanding-action-after-winterbourne-view/ |title=Prime Minister Responds to Letter Demanding Action After Winterbourne View &amp;#124; NDTi |website=Ndti.org.uk |date=2015-03-12 |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011 the Association of Supported Living issued a press statement, which was followed up in writing to every member of parliament in the United Kingdom, calling for community based supported living services to replace institutional services for people with learning disabilities.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' said "Without the investigation by the [[Panorama (TV series)|BBC's Panorama]], given huge coverage in the Mail, the abuse of patients at Winterbourne View might be continuing to this day. As it is, the secure hospital and two other care homes have been shut down, 11 guilty staff have been brought to justice – and a devastating report now exposes the serial failings of the local NHS, police and health watchdogs. For the past year, the [[Leveson Inquiry]] has focused relentlessly on the failings of the media. Never let it be forgotten how much this country owes, in the fight against cruelty and corruption, to its free Press."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mail Leader|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2185152/How-bring-integrity-City.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail|date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' said, "It is impossible to read the details of what went on at Winterbourne View, a care home for the severely disabled in Gloucestershire, without feeling repelled. In the wake of an exposé from the BBC's Panorama, 11 members of staff were convicted of almost 40 charges of neglect and ill treatment of those in their care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Telegraph Leader|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/9459049/Reform-the-regulators.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph|date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Institute of Learning Disabilities Summary|url=http://www.bild.org.uk/news-and-whats-on/winterbourne-view/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningdisabilitycoalition.org.uk/ |title=Learning Disability Coalition |publisher=Learning Disability Coalition |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systemic failings==
The national regulator, the CQC did a nationwide check on facilities owned by the same company, Castlebeck Care  – as a result three more institutions have been closed. The CQC reported a "systemic failure to protect people or to investigate allegations of abuse" and said that Castlebeck Care had "misled" the health watchdog.&lt;ref name="systematic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111027090534/http://www.cqc.org.uk:80/media/regulator-announces-third-castlebeck-service-close ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CQC also came under criticism for failing to respond to early warnings of abuse at the care home. It initially blamed Winterbourne managers who, the CQC said, "effectively misled us by not keeping us informed about incidents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/cqc-report-winterbourne-view-confirms-its-owners-failed-protect-people-abuse |title=CQC report on Winterbourne View confirms its owners failed to protect people from abuse &amp;#124; Care Quality Commission |website=Cqc.org.uk |date=2011-07-18 |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it later emerged that managers had officially alerted the CQC to numerous allegations of staff abusing patients, dating back to February 2008, which were also reported to the police, but did not lead to any convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hosted.southglos.gov.uk/wv/report.pdf |format=PDF |title=South Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults Board |website=Hosted.southglos.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
The CQC also inspected 132 similar institutions and a [[Serious Case Review]] was commissioned – some of the roughly ten local and national enquiries were carried out to examine what went wrong, including one by NHS Southwest which was one of the first to be published and list many of the others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121127132959/http://www.southofengland.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Final-Report-for-publication-Report-of-the-NHS-Review-of-Commissioning-of-Care-and-Treatment-at-Winterbourne-View-30-July-2012.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Other Home Closed|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-15092330 | work=BBC News | date=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The head of the Care Quality Commission resigned ahead of a critical government report, a report in which Winterbourne View was cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cynthia Bower Resigns|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/23/nhs-watchdog-cynthia-bower-resigns | location=London | newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|first=Denis|last=Campbell|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mencap]] published a report warning that similar abuse could be going on elsewhere and calling for the closure of all large institutions far from people's families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mencap Report|url=http://www.mencap.org.uk/outofsight|website=Mencap.org.uk|accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convictions==
Eleven people pleaded guilty to criminal offences of [[neglect]] or [[abuse]] as a result of evidence from Undercover Care and six of them were jailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eleventh Guilty Plea|url=http://www.avonandsomerset.police.uk/LocalPages/NewsDetails.aspx?nsid=25947&amp;t=1&amp;lid=2|website=Thisisbristol.co.uk|accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-20092894 | title=Winterbourne View: Care workers jailed for abuse | publisher=BBC | accessdate=30 October 2012 | date=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the eleventh person pleaded guilty, the Serious Case Review was published, revealing hundreds of previous incidents at the hospital and missed warnings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120810012622/http://www.southglos.gov.uk:80/NR/exeres/DDE51D39-E8AC-4343-8DDA-7F08B03CBA10 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serious Case Review|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Report-Winterbourne-View-identifies-sustained/story-16661739-detail/story.html|website=Thisisbritstol.co.uk|accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
