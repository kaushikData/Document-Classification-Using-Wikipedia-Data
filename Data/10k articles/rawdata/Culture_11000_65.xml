{{nihongo|'''''Angel Guts'''''|天使のはらわた|Tenshi no Harawata}} is a nine-film series of ''[[pink film]]s'' produced between 1978 and 1994. The [[Nikkatsu|Nikkatsu Corporation]] was responsible for the production of the majority of the series. In accordance with the "pink film" genre, the prevalent theme in the series is sex, but violence is also featured prominently in the films. ''Angel Guts'' is based on the ''[[manga]]'' series written by [[Takashi Ishii (film director)|Takashi Ishii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angel Guts: The Nikkatsu Series|url=http://film.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/56640/angel-guts-the-nikkatsu-series.html|work=The Digital Fix|publisher=Poisonous Monkey Limited|accessdate=4 April 2012|author=Kevin Gilvear|format=Web page|date=29 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a public comment on the ''Angel Guts'' series, director [[Noboru Tanaka]] pointed out the various directorial styles exhibited in the films: "...all five versions are different. Mine is very energetic and it looks like you could burn yourself if you touch it, whilst the others are calmer and gentler. I think the audience shouldn't be bored by this series of films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Sharp, Jasper (interviewer); Sharon Hayashi (interpreter)|title=Noboru Tanaka Interview (included with Angel Guts - The Nikkatsu Series - 5 Disc Collector's Edition; Disc Three: Angel Guts: Nami)|publisher=[[Nikkatsu]] / artsmagicdvd.com ATU 017|medium=Motion Picture/DVD|date=2005|time=Chapter 7; 39:00}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not wanting his sister to see what is happening, Kawashima stops them and tells Nami to head back home.

'''Anti-humor''' is a type of indirect [[humor]] that involves the joke-teller delivering something which is intentionally not funny, or lacking in intrinsic meaning. The practice relies on the expectation on the part of the audience of something humorous, and when this does not happen, the [[irony]] itself is of comedic value. Anti-humor is also the basis of various types of [[practical joke|prank]]s and [[hoax]]es.

The humor of such jokes is based on the [[surprise factor]] of absence of an expected [[joke]] or of a [[punch line]] in a narration which is set up as a joke. This kind of [[anti-climax (narrative)|anticlimax]] is similar to that of the [[shaggy dog story]].&lt;ref name=shibles&gt;[[Warren A. Shibles]], [http://facstaff.uww.edu/shiblesw/humorbook/ Humor Reference Guide: A Comprehensive Classification and Analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928195929/http://facstaff.uww.edu/shiblesw/humorbook/ |date=September 28, 2007 }} (Hardcover) 1998 {{ISBN|0-8093-2097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some researchers see the "shaggy dog story" as a type of anti-joke.&lt;ref&gt;John  Henderson, "Writing Down Rome: Satire, Comedy, and Other Offences in Latin Poetry" (1999) {{ISBN|0-19-815077-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uAllRLeoXqYC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=%22anti-joke%22+-wikipedia&amp;sig=lNZmQidTk0cuuoKISaT6HWdjbxQ p. 218]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The [[shaggy dog story]] involves telling an extremely long joke with an intricate (and sometimes horribly grisly) back story  and surreal or repetitive plotline, before ending the story with either a weak [[spoonerism]], or abruptly stopping with no real punchline at all.

Another type of anti-joke gives a suggestion of building to a (typically risqué) punchline, but breaks the audience's anticipation by swerving to a non-risqué punchline or no punchline at all: "Did you hear about the honeymooners who confused the tube of [[K-Y Jelly]] with window putty? Quite the tragedy, all the windows fell out of their new home."{{cn|date=May 2016}}

One more type of anti-humor is found in the joke "[[No soap radio]]". The joke is meant to have no punch line. When someone tells the joke, it is most likely with their friends, and it is meant to confuse others who don't know that there isn't supposed to be a joke.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

==In stand-up comedy==
[[Alternative comedy]], among its other aspects, parodies the traditional idea of the joke as a form of humor.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Stott (2005) "Comedy", {{ISBN|0-415-29933-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFmEDTxID1YC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22anti-joke%22+-wikipedia&amp;sig=vRjt7tgsE3WQmuLOaf4lj8CYH4A p. 119]&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-humor jokes are also often associated with deliberately bad [[stand-up comedian]]s. One very successful stand-up comedian, [[Andy Kaufman]], had his own unique brand of anti-humor, quasi-[[surrealism|surrealist]] acts coupled with performance art; one of his best-known manifestations of this was his act as [[Tony Clifton]], a painfully untalented [[lounge lizard]] entertainer.{{cn|date=October 2018}} [[Norm Macdonald]] is another comedian sometimes associated with performing anti-humor, although he objected to the characterization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://twitchy.com/2014/05/12/norm-macdonald-worthless-anti-comedy-is-for-the-weak-and-cowardly/ | title = Norm Macdonald: ‘Worthless’ anti-comedy ‘is for the weak and cowardly’ | date = May 12, 2014 | publisher = Twitchy Entertainment | accessdate = January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/magazine/norm-macdonald-still-in-search-of-the-perfect-joke.html | title = Norm Macdonald, Still in Search of the Perfect Joke | date = August 31, 2018 | publisher = The New York Times | accessdate = August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Attitudes of Lady Hamilton by Novelli.jpg|thumb|right|Emma, [[Lady Hamilton]] made the striking of attitudes into an art form, portraying classical themes such as the [[Judgement of Paris]].]]
'''Attitude''' as a term of [[fine art]] refers to the [[human position|posture]] or [[gesture]] given to a [[Figurative art|figure]] by a [[painting|painter]] or [[sculptor]].&lt;ref&gt;John Craig, ''A New Universal Etymological, Technological, and Pronouncing Dictionary of the English Language Embracing All the Terms Used in Art, Science, and Literature'' (London, 1844), p. 130 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG0Tup952oMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA130&amp;dq=attitude+intitle:dictionary+intitle:art&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; It applies to the [[human body|body]] and not to a [[mental state]]&lt;!--this link to a disambiguation page is deliberate--&gt;, but the arrangement of the body is presumed to serve a communicative or expressive purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Woldmar Ruoff, ''The Standard Dictionary of Facts'' (The Frontier press company, 1916), p. 222 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mm0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA222&amp;dq=attitude+intitle:dictionary+intitle:art&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a [[Convention (norm)#Others|conventional]] attitude in art is [[proskynesis]] to indicate submissive respect toward [[Christian God|God]], [[emperor]]s, [[cleric]]s of high status, and religious [[icon]]s; in [[Byzantine art]], it is particularly characteristic in depictions of the emperor paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to [[Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Ross, ''Medieval Art: A Topical Dictionary'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996), p. 205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=b-5YPoia7qwC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22PROSKYNESIS.+The+Greek+term%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 20th- and 21st-century [[art history]], "attitude" is used most often to label one of these conventional postures; another example is the [[orans]] pose.

"Attitude" was arguably more important as an [[aesthetic]] term in the 19th century, when it was defined in one art-related dictionary as

&lt;blockquote&gt;the posture or disposition of the limbs and members of a figure, by which we discover the action in which it is engaged, and the very sentiment supposed to be in the mind of the person represented. It comprehends all the motions of the body, and requires a perfect knowledge of [[wikt:ponderation|ponderation]], and whatever refers to the [[center of gravity|centre of gravity]]; but whatsoever attitude be given to any figure, that attitude must show the beautiful parts, as much as the subject will permit, let the subject be what it will. It must, besides, have such a turn as, without departing from probability, or from the character of the figure, may diffuse a [[beauty]] over the action. It is allowed that the choice of fine attitudes constitutes the greatest part of the beauties of grouping.&lt;ref&gt;John Gould, ''Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Artists: Comprising Painters, Sculptors, Engravers, and Architects, from the Earliest Ages to the Present Time'' (London: E. Wilson, 1835), p. xc [https://books.google.com/books?id=O54ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP104&amp;dq=attitude+intitle:dictionary+intitle:art&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''bad boy''' is a cultural [[archetype]] that is variously defined, and is often used synonymously with the historic terms ''[[rake (character)|rake]]'' or ''cad'': a male who behaves badly, especially within societal norms.

==Definitions==
The stereotypical "bad boy" was described by Kristina Grish in her book ''Addickted'' as "the irresistible rogue who has the dizzying ability to drive women wild" with a "laissez-faire attitude about life and love".&lt;ref&gt;Kristina Grish, ''Addickted: 12 Steps to Kicking Your Bad Boy Habit'' (2007) p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''[[The Independent]]'' compared the term "bad boys" with men who had a particular combination of personality traits, sometimes referred to as a "[[dark triad]]", and reported that a study found that such men were likely to have a greater number of sexual [[affair]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/why-women-really-do-love-selfobsessed-psychopaths-850007.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Why women really do love self-obsessed psychopaths | first=Steve | last=Connor | date=June 19, 2008 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1601">The '''Bagnolo steles''' are two  stone boulders found in Ceresolo-Bagnolo, [[Malegno]] commune, [[Brescia]] province, [[Lombardia]], Northern [[Italy]], at the base of Monte Mignone, at an altitude of ca. 700 m. '''Bagnolo 1'''  was discovered in 1963, bearing  depictions of 14 items, engraved by hammering. Recognizable are drawings of a [[Sun]], an [[axe]] and several [[dagger]]s of the "[[Remedello]]" type, a belt and an [[ibex]]. [[File:Bagnolo2.jpg|thumb|Bagnolo stele 1]]

In 1972, '''Bagnolo 2''' was discovered, a similar stele with 16 engravings, showing the same daggers and axes, and a Sun, as well as a figure of a dog, and a ploughman with a team of two oxen, and patterns interpreted as necklaces and pendants. [[File:Bagnolo1.jpg|thumb|Bagnlo stele 2]]

Fragments of other engraving were found in nearby Ossimo and Borno.

From the style of the daggers depicted, the engravings have been dated to the Italian [[Chalcolithic]], early to mid 3rd millennium BC, probably predating the presence of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] on the peninsula.

'''''Bildung''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbɪldʊŋ|lang}}, ''[[wikt:Bildung#German|"education, formation, etc."]]'') refers to the German tradition of self-cultivation (as related to the German for: creation, image, shape), wherein philosophy and education are linked in a manner that refers to a process of both personal and cultural maturation. This maturation is described as a harmonization of the individual's mind and heart and in a unification of selfhood and identity within the broader society, as evidenced with the literary tradition of ''[[Bildungsroman]]''.

In this sense, the process of harmonization of mind, heart, selfhood and identity is achieved through personal transformation, which presents a challenge to the individual's accepted beliefs. In [[Hegel]]'s writings, the challenge of personal growth often involves an agonizing alienation from one's "natural consciousness" that leads to a reunification and development of the self.  Similarly, although social unity requires well-formed institutions, it also requires a diversity of individuals with the [[Positive liberty|freedom]] (in the positive sense of the term) to develop a wide-variety of talents and abilities and this requires personal [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]].  However, rather than an end state, both individual and social unification is a process that is driven by unrelenting negations.

In this sense, education involves the shaping of the human being with regard to his/her own [[Human condition|humanity]] as well as his/her innate intellectual skills. So, the term refers a process of becoming that can be related to a process of becoming within [[Existentialism]].

The term ''Bildung'' also corresponds to the [[Humboldtian model of higher education]] from the work of Prussian philosopher and educational administrator [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767–1835). Thus, in this context, the concept of education becomes a lifelong process of human development, rather than mere training in gaining certain external knowledge or skills.  Such training in skills is known by the German words ''Erziehung'', and ''Ausbildung''. ''Bildung'' in contrast is seen as a process wherein an individual's spiritual and cultural sensibilities as well as life, personal and social skills are in process of continual expansion and growth. Bildung is seen as a way to become more free due to higher self-reflection. Von Humboldt wrote with respect to ''Bildung'' in 1793/1794: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Education [''Bildung''], truth and virtue" must be disseminated to such an extent that the "concept of mankind" takes on a great and dignified form in each individual (GS, I, p. 284). However, this shall be achieved personally by each individual, who must "absorb the great mass of material offered to him by the world around him and by his inner existence, using all the possibilities of his receptiveness; he must then reshape that material with all the energies of his own activity and appropriate it to himself so as to create an interaction between his own personality and nature in a most general, active and harmonious form".&lt;ref&gt;"Theory of Bildung" by Wilhelm von Humboldt, Chapter 3 in ''Teaching As A Reflective Practice: The German Didaktik Tradition'' edited by Ian Westbury, Stefan Hopmann, Kurt Riquarts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Most explicitly in Hegel's writings, the ''Bildung'' tradition rejects the pre-Kantian metaphysics of being for a post-Kantian metaphysics of experience that rejects universal narratives.  Much of Hegel's writings were about the nature of education (both ''Bildung'' and ''Erziehung''), reflecting his own role as a teacher and administrator in German secondary schools, and in his more general writings.&lt;ref&gt;see Allen W. Wood "Hegel on Education, in Amélie O. Rorty (ed.) ''Philosophy as Education''.  London: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
A more contemporary view was developed by Tony Waters: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Bildung'', I discovered in my 2 years in Germany, is an organizing cultural principle for German higher education that trumps both careerism and disciplinary silos. It is generally translated as "education", but in fact it means more—dictionary definitions often refer to "self-cultivation", "philosophy", "personal and cultural maturation" and even "existentialism". Bildung is the cry of the land of poets and thinkers against the demands of credentialism, professionalism, careerism and the financial temptations dangled to graduating students.&lt;ref&gt;"Teach Like You Do in America: Personal Reflections on Teaching Across Borders in Tanzania and Germany."  ''Palgrave Communications'' 1, Article number: 15026 (2015) doi:10.1057/palcomms.2015.26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this way, fulfillment is achieved through practical activity that promotes the development of one's own individual talents and abilities which in turn lead to the development of one's society. In this way, Bildung does not simply accept the socio-political status quo, but rather it includes the ability to engage in a critique of one's society, and to ultimately challenge the society to actualize its own highest ideals.

== History ==
[[File:Lev Vygotsky 1896-1934.jpg|left|thumb|257x257px|[[Lev Vygotsky]]]]
[[File:Alexander Luria.jpg|thumb|238x238px|[[Alexander Luria]]]]
[[Lev Vygotsky]], born in Orsha, Russia (now in Belarus) in 1896, was a psychologist who contributed mostly to developmental psychology.

Vygotsky posed that in a social environment, children develop higher cognitive functions in practical activities. His theories were controversial in the Soviet Union and they remained virtually unknown, although introduced into the [[Western world]] in the 1930s, until the 1970s. This is when they became a pivotal point in models built in developmental and educational psychology. Although many current scholars do not agree with his theories or agree about what he meant, the 21st century has brought about scholarly reevaluations of many of the important aspects of these theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revisionist Revolution in Vygotsky Studies: The State of the Art|last=Yasnitsky|first=Anton|last2=van der Veer|first2=René|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781138887305|location=East Sussex, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Luria]] was a neuropsychologist and developmental psychologist. Together with Vygotsky, he helped create cultural-historical psychology and was a leader of the [[Vygotsky Circle]]. Separate to his work with Vygotsky, Luria is known for his case studies "The Mind of a Mnemonist", about a man with a highly advanced memory, and "The Man with a Shattered World", about a man with [[traumatic brain injury]].

== Theoretical premises ==
Cultural-historical psychology never existed as such during Vygotsky's lifetime. He never accomplished a developmental theory of his own and, by his own admission, died at the threshold of a new psychological theory of [[consciousness]].

Vygotsky believed in the "[[New Soviet man|new man]]" that he referred to as a "superman" of the future [[Communist society]] and advocated for a psychological theory that would account for the development from the actual level of human development to the potential one of a "superman". To that end, he claimed that the development of "higher psychological functions" are a result of the impact of parents, caregivers, peers and the culture at large. In one of his unfinished and abandoned manuscripts that was never published during his lifetime Vygotsky speculated that &lt;blockquote&gt;Every function in the child's cultural development appears twice: first, on the social level, and later, on the individual level; first, between people (interpsychological) and then inside the child (intrapsychological). This applies equally to voluntary attention, to logical memory, and to the formation of concepts. All the high functions originate as actual relationships between individuals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.verywell.com/what-is-sociocultural-theory-2795088|title=Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory: What You Should Know|website=[[Verywell]]|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This idea was well known at least fifty years before Vygotsky, was advocated for by a number of other psychologists, and is known under the label of "[[sociogenesis]]". The post-Vygotskian tradition focuses, thus, not only on individual learning and the influences adults and peers have on learning, but also on how cultural beliefs and attitudes affect instruction and learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In contradistinction to [[Freud]]'s and Freudian "[[depth psychology]]" and the [[behaviorists]] (and many others) "surface psychologies" of the average people in their everyday environment, Vygotsky postulated "peak psychology" of his own, which would focus on the highest, "peak" performance of people in their actual life and potential, future "superman" capacity. This "peak psychology" was never accomplished and largely remained an interesting and promising, yet [[utopian]] scientific project of considerable interest in the contemporary context of 21st century psychological research.

== The benefits and failings of the theory ==
The larger project of the new psychology of Vygotsky and Luria failed,&lt;ref name="joravsky"&gt;Cf.: "He laid out a most ambitious program of unification with an 'historico-cultural' approach as the central feature. Though tuberculosis cut him off at a very early age, Vygotsky left prolific disciples, most notably Luria and A.N. Leont'ev, who founded the Vygotsky school of cognitive psychology, focused on brain damage and on child development. There is a great irony in that history: preaching a comprehensive science, Vygotsky started one more school" (p. 254). Joravsky, D. (1989). Russian psychology: a critical history. Cambridge: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; and no universal integrative theory of human mind and development was built by the time of Vygotsky's death in 1934 or, for that matter, ever after. However, the earlier intellectual effort and the legacy of the Soviet scholars of the 1920s-1930s was not entirely wasted and later developed in a range of special—typically, loosely related—fields of psychological theory and practice such as [[cultural psychology|cultural]]&lt;ref name="handbook-cultMediation"&gt;Arievich, I.M. &amp; Stetsenko, A.

A few of these earlier influences were subsequently downplayed, misunderstood or even totally ignored and forgotten. Thus, cultural-historical psychology understood as the Vygotsky-Luria project, originally intended by its creators as an integrative and, later, holistic "new psychology" of socio-biological and cultural development should not be confused with later self-proclaimed "Vygotskian" theories and fields of studies, ignorant of the historical roots and the intended breadth and depth of the original proposal and its consistent emphasis on the need in a new theory of consciousness.&lt;ref name="handbook-consciousness"/&gt; These include such as ''sociocultural psychology'', ''socio-historical psychology'', ''[[activity theory]]'', ''[[cultural psychology]]'', or ''[[cultural-historical activity theory]] (CHAT)''.&lt;ref name="activityTheoryDead"&gt;Toomela, A.

== [[Vygotsky Circle|Vygotsky-Luria Circle]] ==
Vygotsky and Luria informally collaborated with other psychologists, educationalists, medical specialists, physiologists, and neuroscientists. The foundation of the integrative science of the mind, brain, and behavior in their bio-social development, was the main work of the Circle. They incorporated ideas of social and interpersonal relations, the practices of empirical scientific research, and "Stalinist science" founded on the discursive practices of Soviet science in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yasnitsky|first=Anton|date=2011|title=Vygotsky Circle as a Personal Network of Scholars: Restoring Connections Between People and Ideas|url=|journal=Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science|doi=10.1007/s12124-011-9168-5|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were around three dozen people involved in the research for Vygotsky's theory, at different periods of time.

In 1924, the Circle was formed in Moscow after Vygotsky moved there from Gomel, Belarus. At the Institute of Psychology he met Zankov, Solv'ev, Sakharov, and Varshava, as well as Alexander Luria, with whom he would go on to collaborate with.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The group grew at a gradual rate and all research was conducted in Moscow, Kharhov, and Liningrad, located in the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union was invaded by Germany during the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]] (1941), the group disbanded and any further post-Vygotskian research after the beginning of [[World War II]], was conducted by Luria, Leontiev, Zankov, and Elkonin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The ancient and refined traditional '''culture of [[Kathmandu]]''', for that matter in the whole of [[Nepal]], is an uninterrupted and exceptional meeting of the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] ethos practiced by its highly religious people. It has also embraced in its fold the cultural diversity provided by the other religions such as [[Jainism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].

The ancient trade route between [[India]] and [[Tibet]] that passed through Kathmandu enabled fusion of artistic and architectural traditions of other cultures to be amalgamated with local architectural and artistic culture.&lt;ref name=festival&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=142&amp;pr_id=172|title=Festivals|accessdate=2009-12-12|publisher= Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City Core has most of the remarkable cultural wealth that evolved during the reign of the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla]] kings between 15th and 18th centuries. The city was filled with sculptures, [[pagoda]]s, [[stupa]]s and palace buildings of exceptional beauty. There are also 106 monastic courtyards (known as [[Bahal, Nepal|baha]] or bahi) known for their art and piety. The level of skill of the local artisans are the exquisite wood carving, stone carving, metal casting, weaving, pottery and other crafts. The finest wood carvings are seen on the ornate windows of old buildings and on the roof struts of temples. Carving skills of the local artisans are seen at every street corner in the form of images of gods and goddesses and sunken water spouts.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=137&amp;pr_id=167|title=Katmandu as a world Heritage Site|accessdate=2009-12-12|publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==

[[File:Stone carving in Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|upright|Stone carvings, called Chaityas, seen even in street corners and courtyards]]
Kathmandu valley has been described as "an enormous treasure house of art and sculptures". These treasures are made of wood, stone, metal and terracotta, and found in profusion in various temples, shrines, stupas, gompas, chaityas and palaces. The art objects are also seen in street corners, lanes, private courtyards and in open ground; mostly in the form of icons of gods and goddesses. Kathmandu valley has been the repositary of all this art treasure for a long time but it got a worldwide exposure only after the country opened its doors to the outside world in 1950.&lt;ref name="Jha p.21"&gt;Jha p.21&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Durga idol at Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|Kathmandu]]
The religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular is iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as: the Bhavani, Durga, Gaja -Lakshmi, Hariti-Sitala, Mahsishamardini, Saptamatrika (seven mother goddesses) and Sri-Lakshmi. From the 3rd century BC, apart from the Hindu Gods and Goddesses, Buddhist monuments from the [[Ashoka]]n period (it is said that [[Emperor Ashoka|Ashoka]] visited Nepal in 250&amp;nbsp;BC) have also embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular. These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution namely, the Licchavi or classical period (500 to 900&amp;nbsp;AD) with motivation from the Gupta period in India; the post-classical period (1000 to 1400&amp;nbsp;AD) with strong influence of the Palla art form that extended to Tibet as well; and of the Malla period (1400 onwards) that exhibited explicitly [[tantra|tantric]] influences coupled with the demonic art of the [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan]] [[Demonology]].&lt;ref name="Jha p.23"&gt;Jha p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

A broad typology has been ascribed to the decorative designs and impressive carvings created by the creative and artistic people of Nepal, who have maintained a perfect blend of the two religious faiths of Hinduism and Buddhism. This typology based on the type of material used in the art forms is five in number. These are: the Stone Art, the Metal Art; the Wood Art; the Terracotta Art; and the Painting.&lt;ref&gt;Jha pp.23–24&lt;/ref&gt; These are briefly elaborated.

;Stone art
In the earliest times, at the dawn of civilization, stone heaps (made of boulders, pebbles etc.) were worshipped in Nepal, which is seen at several locations. The first real stone carvings started under the influence of the Mathura Art of India; some of these carvings are seen in the Pashupathinath temple complex. Later in mid 5th century AD Nepal Art evolved under the Ikshvaku, Gupta, Pala and Deccan Schools of Art forms. But the Nepalese sculptors improved on these forms which provide a typical style of Nepal.&lt;ref name="Jha p.23"/&gt;

;Metal art
[[File:Bhairava Népal Tibet 21107.jpg|thumb|right|Mask of [[Bhairava]]]]
Metal images made of ashtadhatu (amalgam of eight metals) are common in Nepal and Indi, under both Hindu and Buddhist religious traditions. During the Licchavi period bronze in solid form was widely used for casting metallic sculptures; mostly between the seventh and eight centuries. But in the Medieval period Pala influence evolved into a distinct form. These can be seen in the form of large royal figures fixed on top of pillars in Durbar Squares of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur. Smaller and hollow cast bronze statues were made as icons for worship. In Tiebtan metal work, a hole was left in the bronze statues for filling with mantras written on paper or filling with offering of grains, precious stones or miniature icons. But the hole was sealed with copper in the presence of a Lama before formal consecration of the image. Here again there are two forms- one of Gods and Goddesses of [[Mahayana]] school in Pala art form and the other iconography inspiration of the [[Shamanic]] practice of Tibetan Demonology.&lt;ref name="Jha p.24"&gt;Jha p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

;Wood art
It is the traditional architecture in the Kathmandu valley in temples, palaces, monasteries and houses a perfected Neawri art form generally carved very artistically out of [[Shorea robusta|Sal]] (Shorea), [[teak]] (agarth), [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]] (cedrus) and [[Sisso]] ([[dalbegia]]). Malla Kings patronized this art form from 12th century onwards. Its life span is affected by mild climate, linches, mosses, insects, borers, dry rots and biochemical defects. In the 14th century earthquake many of the wooden monuments were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Jha p.25"&gt;Jha p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

;Terra cotta
Tera cotta art in Nepal is traced to the 300&amp;nbsp;BC. It was perfected between 16th and 18th centuries Archeological excavations have unearthed hand-pressed moulds at Dhum Varahi at the fringes of Kathmandu, which are preserved in the museums in Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur. The male and female figures decorated in bands around temples, called Nagabands were made of terra cotta. Other fine examples of terra cotta art mentioned are Mahabuddha and Mayadevi temples in Patan and gateway of the Teleju temple in Hanumandhoka complex. Clay is the basic ingredient of this art form .&lt;ref name="Jha p.25"/&gt;

;Paintings
Paintings are categorized under two broad head namely the religious and the non-religious. The religious category is further subdivided into three forms of painted manuscripts, [[Thangka]]s or [[Paubha]]s and Pattas (banners) or metal strips.&lt;ref&gt;Jha p.26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums===

[[File:Nepal National Museum.jpg|thumb|right|[[National Museum of Nepal]]]]
Kathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries, including the [[National Museum of Nepal]] and the Natural History Museum of Nepal.
Nepals’s art and architecture is a dazzling display from medieval to the present, which is a heady amalgamation of two of the ancient and greatest religions of the world – Hinduism and Buddhhism. These are amply reflected not only in the many temples, shrines, stupas, monasteries and palaces in the seven well defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage site but also in its well planned and well exhibited displays in museums and art galleries spread all over the Metropolitan area and also in its sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur. The museums display unique artifacts and paintings from 5th century AD onwards to date, including archeological exportations.&lt;ref name=asia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |title=Museums and Art Galleries of Nepal |accessdate=2009-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FkdgUe0D?url=http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |archivedate=2013-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museums and Art galleries are: the National Museum; the Natural History Museum; Hanumandhoka Palace Complex; the Tribhuvan Museum; the Mahendra Museum; the Birendra Museum; National Library: the Birendra Museum; the Kaiser Library; the Asa Archives; the Patan Museum; the National Art Gallery; the Pujarimath Museum; the Bronze and Brass Museum; the NAFA Gallery; the Srijana Contemporary Art Gallery; the J Art Gallery; the NEF-ART (Nepal Fine Art) Gallery; the Moti Azima Gallery; and the Nepal Art Council Gallery.&lt;ref name=asia/&gt; Some of the important museums and galleries are elaborated.
[[File:Cloisonne Buddha Statue in Buddhist Art Gallery, Kathmandu, Nepal.jpg|thumb|upright|A Buddhist statue display in Kathmandu]]
The National Museum is located in the western part of Kathmandu near the Swoyambhunath stupa
in the historical building which was constructed in early 19th century by General [[Bhimsen Thapa]]. It is the most important museum in the country, housing an extensive collection of weapons, art and antiquities of historic and cultural importance.&lt;ref name="Museums"&gt;{{cite web

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was established in 1928 as a collection house of war trophies and weapons, and the initial name of this museum was ''Chhauni Silkhana'', which literally means "the stone house of arms and ammunition". Given its focus, the museum contains an extensive quantity of weapons, including locally made firearms used in various wars and [[leather]] [[cannon]]s from the 18th–19th century and medieval and modern works in [[wood]], [[bronze]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], and [[painting]]s.&lt;ref name="Museums"/&gt;

The Natural History Museum is located in the southern foothills of Swoyambhunath hill and has a sizeable collection of different species of animals, [[butterflies]] and plants. The museum is noted in particular for its serial display of diverse life species from prehistoric shells to the stuffed animals, birds, [[crocodile]]s and many others.&lt;ref name="Museums"/&gt;

The Hanumandhoka Palace, a lavish medieval palace complex in the Durbar, contains three separate museums of historic importance:
The Tribhuvan Museum contains artifacts related to the King [[Tribhuvan]] (1906–1955). It has a variety of pieces including his personal belongings, letters and papers and memorabilia related to events he was involved in and a rare collection of photos and paintings of Royal family members.&lt;ref name="Museums"/&gt; 
The Mahendra Museum is also dedicated to a king, [[Mahendra of Nepal|Mahendra]] (1920–1972 ). Like the Tribhuvan Museum, it includes his personal belongings such as decorations, [[Postage stamp|stamps]] and [[coin]]s and personal notes and manuscripts, but it also has structural reconstructions of his cabinet room and office chamber.&lt;ref name="Museums"/&gt;
The Birendra museum contains items related to the late monarch, King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah (1972-2001), including the royal dress worn during various state and historic occasions, medals and honorary titles received from other head of states and many more.&lt;ref name="Museums"/&gt;

===Art galleries===

Kathmandu is a center for art in Nepal, displaying the work of contemporary artists in the country and also collections of historical artists. [[Patan, Lalitpur|Patan]] is particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts. Art in Kathmandu is vibrant, demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art, derived from a great number of national, Asian and global influences. Nepalese art though is commonly divided into two areas, the idealistic traditional painting known as [[Paubha]]s in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as [[Thangka]]s in Tibetan, which are usually highly colorful and bold and closely linked to the country's religious history and then the contemporary western style painting, including nature based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for.&lt;ref name="Museums"/&gt; Internationally, the British-based charity, the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with protecting arts in Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathmanduarts.org/ |title=Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre |publisher=Kathmanduarts.org |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kathmandu contains many notable art galleries. The NAFA Gallery, operated by the Arts and crafts Department of the Royal Nepal Academy is housed in Sita Bhavan, a neo- classical old Rana palace, divided into two galleries, the permanent Birendra Art Gallery which displays works of successful contemporary painters and sculptors. and a temporary gallery featuring artwork of up and coming Nepalese artists of the country.&lt;ref name="Museums"/&gt;

The Srijana Contemporary Art Gallery, located inside the Bhrikutimandap Exhibition grounds, hosts the work of contemporary painters and sculptors, and regularly organizes exhibitions, both solo and group shows. It also runs morning and evening classes in the various schools of art.&lt;ref name="Museums"/&gt; Also of note is the Moti Azima Gallery, located in a three storied building in Bhimsenthan which contains an impressive collection of traditional utensils and handmade [[doll]]s and items typical of a medieval [[Newar]] house, giving an important insight into Nepalese history.&lt;ref name="Museums"/&gt; The J Art Gallery is also located in Kathmandu, near the Royal Palace in Durbarmarg, Kathmandu and displays the artwork of eminent, established Nepalese painters and the Nepal Art Council Gallery, which is located in the Babar Mahal, on the way to [[Tribhuvan International Airport]] which contains artwork of both national and international artists and contains extensive halls regularly used for art exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Museums"/&gt;

===Literature===

[[File:Kathmandu Garden at Kaishar Mahal library.jpg|thumb|Kaiser Mahal library]]

The National Library of Nepal, is located in [[Patan, Lalitpur|Patan]], the largest in country with in excess of more than 70,000 books, mostly in English, but also with many in [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Hindi]] and [[Nepal Bhasa]].&lt;ref name="Museums"/&gt; The library is in possession of rare scholarly books in Sanskrit and English dating from the 17th century AD. Kathmandu contains the Kaiser Library, located in the Kaiser Mahal on the ground floor of Ministry of Education building. The collection which totals around 45,000 books, is derived from a personal collection of the Field Marshal Kaiser Shumsher Rana.&lt;ref name="Museums"/&gt; It covers a wide range of subjects including history, law, art, religion, philosophy etc. and a Sanskrit manual of '[[Tantra]]', believed to be over 1000 years old.&lt;ref name="Museums"/&gt;

[[File:Tibetan monks Boudhanath 1973.JPG|thumb|right|Tibetan monks performing music in the Boudhanath]]
Kathmandu is the centre of music and dance in Nepal and is integral to understanding the city. Various musical performances are organized in the cultural venues (Visit: Atul Gautam Memorial Gurukul, Kirateshwor, Kapan Music Center)  of the city throughout the year. The city contains prestigious musical training schools such as the Atul Gautam Memorial Gurukul, Kirateshwor, Kapan Music Center, Asian Himalayan Music School.

There are various music venues and musical performances may include the Bhanchha Ghar in Kamaladi, Bhojan Griha in Dillibazar and the Nepali Chulo in Durbar Marg. Given the importance of Kathmandu to Tibetan Buddhists, the city also attracts monks from Tibet and across the Himalayan region who in coordination with their rituals in visiting sites such as the Boudhanath, will perform music there.

Kathmandu is noted internationally for its [[jazz]] festival, popularly known as [[Jazzmandu]]. It is the only jazz festival in the entire Himalayan region and was established in March 2002. The festival attracts musicians from countries worldwide such as [[Australia]], [[Denmark]], [[United States]], [[Benin]], and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nepalitimes.com.np/issue/317/Music/12568 |title=The jazz peace |publisher=[[Nepali Times]] |date=2006-09-29 |accessdate=2009-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006064212/http://www.nepalitimes.com.np/issue/317/Music/12568 |archivedate=2008-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gene Aitken Jazz Conservatory.jpg|thumb|US Cultural Envoy Gene Aitken opening the [[Kathmandu Jazz Conservatory]] in Nepal in 2008]]

On June 9, 2008, US Cultural Envoy Gene Aitken inaugurated the [[Kathmandu Jazz Conservatory]] (KJC) in nearby [[Patan, Lalitpur|Lalitpur]]. A 10-day workshop for over 50 music teachers and Nepali jazz educators was initially held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepal.usembassy.gov/ep-06-09-20010.html|title=U.S. Cultural Envoy Inaugurates KJC|publisher=US Department of State|date=2008-06-09|accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mandate of the Conservatory is to create a musical environment where musicians can become knowledgeable in various musical subjects, be exposed to different [[music genre]]s, and most importantly, where all musicians, from beginners to advanced, can receive a proper [[music education]]. Investment in the school has been substantial. Facilities include a music hall which can seat 200 people, a [[music library]], a listening lab, five practice rooms, two large rooms for ensemble rehearsal and group classes, separate rooms for both [[drum kit]] and [[percussion instruments]], a piano practice room and a [[recording studio]].

The cultural diversity of Nepal has facilitated the growth of a number of cuisines based on the ethnic groups and the geographical features of the nation. Popularly served though is [[Dal bhat]], which is a dish of lentils and rice, generally served with vegetable curries and forms a staple part of the diet. Given that Kathmandu only had one restaurant in 1955,&lt;ref name="LP 2003, p.91"&gt;
Lonely Planet (2003), pp.91–2&lt;/ref&gt; a large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since grown up catering in [[Nepalese cuisine]], [[Tibetan cuisine]] and [[Indian cuisine]] in particular and many others to accommodate both for Nepalese people and for tourists from all around the world. The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American [[chop suey]], which is a sweet and sour sauce with crispy noodles, with a [[fried egg]] commonly added on top and other westernized adaptions of traditional cuisine.&lt;ref name="LP 2003, p.91"/&gt;
Kathmandu is particularly famous for "Mo: mo:". Mo: mo: or म:म: is a type of dumpling that origined from Tibet. Many street vendors sell mo: mo:. It is one of the most popular fast foods in Kathmandu.

The national drink of Nepal is tea, widely served in Kathmandu, but is served extremely weak by western standards. ''Chiya'', however, is richer and contains tea leaves boiled with milk, sugar and spices and the drink ''[[lassi]]s'', made of [[curd]]s and [[sugar]] is also served in cafes and restaurants. Nepalese beer is available in such venues and in markets, including the national Gorkha beer brand. The popular Himalayan drinks of ''[[Chhaang]]'' and ''[[Tongba]]'', typically made from fermented millet or barley and also sold, as are the harder spirit drinks of ''[[Arrack (drink)|arak]]'', made from fermented potatoes and rice. and ''[[rakshi]]'', a modern type of Newari wine. Shops and bars in Kathmandu do, however, widely sell western and Indian beers, although shops are forbidden to sell alcohol on the first two days and last two days of the Newari month.&lt;ref name="LP 2003, p.91"/&gt;

Fresh vegetables and fruit are widely sold in Kathmandu, particularly around the Durbar. The assortment of produce is diverse, and some sellers may specialise in the sale of different forms of specific vegetables, such as beans, for instance. Western convenience foods are sold in abundance in most of the shops, including [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] beer, [[Coca-Cola]] and various potato snacks and candy.

===Festivals===
[[File:Sakela sili.jpg|thumb|right|Festive dance of Kiratis, an ancient ethnic group of Nepal]]
Most of the fairs and festivals that are observed in Kathmandu have their origin to the Malla period. This was further given an urban cultural touch, not limiting it to the Newari festivities, subsequent to the Gorkha conquest in 1768–69. The culture of Parbatiyas and new migrant communities were also harmoniously amalgamated. The festivities such as the Ghode (horse) jatra, Indra-Jatra, Dasai [[Durga Puja]] festivals, [[Shivratri]] and many more are observed by all Hindu and Buddhist communities of Kathmandu with great devotional fervour and enthusiasm. Social regulation in the codes enacted incorporated the Hindu religious traditions and ethics. These were followed by the Shah Kings as had been followed by previous kings, as devout Hindus and protectors of Buddhist religion. [[Christian]] [[proselytizing]] was not allowed by the Shahs though [[Christian missionaries]] did try to spread the message of [[Christ]] in the Himalayan kingdom.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
{{double image|left|Dewali festival garlands.jpg|180|Dewali festival rangoli.jpg|180|Tihar Festival.}}
Cultural continuity has been maintained for centuries – from ancient to modern period – in the exclusive worship of goddesses and deities such as the [[Ajima]], Taleju (or Tulja Bhavani), Degutaleju, Kumari (the living goddess) and so forth in Kathmandu and the rest of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The artistic edifices have now become places of worship in the everyday life of the people, and thus a roster is maintained to observe the annual festivals, which is intimately linked with the daily life of the people. It is said that there are 133 festivals held in year.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;

Some of the traditional festivals observed in Kathmandu now are: Bada Dashain, [[Mohani]], Tihar, [[Swanti (festival)|Swanti]], Chhath, Maghe Sankranti, Naga Panchami, Janai Poornima, Pancha Dan, Teej/Rishi Panchami, Indra Jatra [[Yenya]], Ghanta Karna, Buddha Jayanti, Sri Panchami, Maha Shivaratri, Phagu Poornima, [[Pahan Charhe]], Ghodejatra, Chaite Dashain, Nava Varsha, [[Jana Baha Dyah Jatra]] and Matatirtha Aunsi, apart from those mentioned earlier.&lt;ref name=festival/&gt;

'''''Demand-side learning''''' is a phrase coined by Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and [[Pankaj Ghemawat]] of [[Harvard Business School]] in the article ''[[Microsoft]] vs. [[Open Source]]: Who Will Win?'' by Sean Silverthorne from June 6, 2005. 

Demand-side learning refers to [[open source software]]'s ability to be modified by the user community at large as needs and wants those who use the software at no charge, they have the incentive to modify the software and learn about how it works. Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and Pankaj Ghemawat also suggest that regardless of the strength of Linux's demand-side learning this alone is not sufficient for Linux to win the competitive battle against Windows.

'''Denotation''' is a translation of a sign to its [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]], precisely to its [[wikt:literal#Adjective|literal]] meaning, more or less like dictionaries try to define it. Denotation is sometimes contrasted to [[connotation]], which includes [[association (psychology)|associated]] meanings. The denotational meaning of a word  is perceived through visible concepts, whereas connotational meaning evokes sensible attitudes towards the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;https://tr.scribd.com/document/137895627/%D0%92-%D0%9D-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0&lt;/ref&gt;

==In semiotics==
{{main|denotation (semiotics)}}
In [[logic]], [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]], the denotation of a word or [[phrase]] is a part of its [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]; however, the part referred to varies by context:
* In [[grammar]] and [[literary theory]], the '''literal''' meaning or "dictionary definition" of a term, devoid of emotion, attitude, and color.
* In [[denotation (Semiotics)|semiotics]], the surface or literal meaning of a signifier.
* In logic, formal semantics and parts of linguistics, the [[Extension (semantics)|extension]] of a term.

==In other fields==
* In [[computer science]], [[denotational semantics]] is contrasted with [[operational semantics]].
*In [[media studies]] terminology, denotation is an example of the first level of analysis: what the audience can visually see on a page. Denotation often refers to something literal, and avoids being a [[metaphor]]. Here it is usually coupled with [[connotation]] which is the second level of analysis, being what the denotation represents.

==Examples==
{|
|-
| [[Image:Cartoony red rose.svg|left|100px|right|Example one.]]
The denotation of this example is a red rose with a green stem. The connotation is that it is a '''symbol''' of passion and love – this is what the rose represents.
|-
| [[Image:Cartoony cross.svg|100px|left|Example two.]]
The denotation is a brown cross. The connotation is a '''symbol''' of religion, according to the media connotation. However, to be more specific this is a '''symbol''' of Christianity.
|-
| [[Image:Cartoony heart.svg|100px|left|Example seven
.]]
The denotation is a [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of a cartoon heart. The connotation is a '''symbol''' of love and affection.

In [[economics]], a '''durable good''' or a '''hard good''' is a [[Good (economics)|good]] that does not quickly wear out, or more specifically, one that yields [[utility]] over time rather than being completely [[Consumption (economics)|consumed]] in one use. Items like [[brick]]s could be considered perfectly durable goods because they should theoretically never wear out. Highly durable goods such as [[refrigerator]]s or [[car]]s usually continue to be useful for three or more years of use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Examples of consumer durable goods include [[automobiles]], [[books]], [[household goods]] ([[home appliance]]s, [[consumer electronics]], [[furniture]], [[tools]], etc.), [[sports equipment]], [[jewelry]], [[medical equipment]], [[firearms]], and [[toy]]s.

'''Nondurable goods''' or '''soft goods''' ([[consumables]]) are the opposite of durable goods. They may be defined either as goods that are immediately consumed in one use or ones that have a lifespan of less than three years.

Examples of nondurable goods include [[fast-moving consumer goods]] such as [[cosmetics]] and cleaning products, food, condiments, fuel, beer, cigarettes and tobacco, medication, office supplies, packaging and containers, paper and paper products, personal products, rubber, plastics, textiles, clothing, and footwear.

While durable goods can usually be rented as well as bought, nondurable goods generally are not rented. While buying durable goods comes under the category of investment demand of goods, buying non-durables comes under the category of consumption demand of goods.

== Durability ==
According to Cooper (1994, p5)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/24666/1/201125_7266%20Cooper%20Publisher.pdf|title=Beyond Recycling: The longer life option|last=Cooper|first=Tim|publisher=The New Economics Foundation|year=1994|oclc=48830517|location=Whitechapel Road, London|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "''[[durability]] is the ability of a product to perform its required function over a lengthy period under normal conditions of use without excessive expenditure on maintenance or repair''". Several units may be used to measure the durability of a product according to its field of application such as years of existence, hours of use and operational cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Longer Lasting Products: alternatives to the throwaway society|last=Stahel|first=Walter|publisher=Gower|year=2010|isbn=978-0-566-08808-7|editor-last=Cooper|editor-first=Tim|location=Farnham|pages=|chapter=Durability, Function and Performance|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Product life spans and sustainable consumption ===
The life span of household goods is significant for [[sustainable consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=1994|title=The durability of consumer durables|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bse.3280030103/full|journal=Business Strategy and the Environment|volume= 3| issue = 1|pages=23–30|via=Willey|doi=10.1002/bse.3280030103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longer product life spans could contribute to eco-efficiency and sufficiency, thus, slowing consumption in order to progress towards a sustainable consumption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=2005|title=Slower Consumption Reflections on Product Life Spans and the "Throwaway Society"|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1162/1088198054084671/abstract|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume= 9| issue = 1–2|pages=51–67|via=Willey|doi=10.1162/1088198054084671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper (2005) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; proposed a model to demonstrate the crucial role of product life spans to sustainable production and consumption.

Durability as a characteristic relating to the quality of goods, that can be demanded by consumers, was not clear until an amendment of the law relating to the quality standards for supplied goods in 1994[[Durability#cite note-5|[5]]].

The language itself is poorly attested, but it gave rise to numerous loanwords in [[Old French]]. [[Old Dutch]] is the term for the Old Franconian dialects that were  spoken in the [[Low Countries]], including present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and Western parts of today's Germany, until about the 12th century when it evolved into [[Middle Dutch]].

During the [[Merovingian period]], Frankish had significant influence on the [[Romance languages]] which displaced it after these evolved from the [[Latin language]] which was introduced into [[Frankish Gaul|Gaul]] by the Romans. As a result, many modern [[French language|French]] words and placenames, including the country name "France", have a Frankish (i.e. Germanic) origin. France itself is still known by terms meaning the "[[Frankish Realm]]" in languages such as [[German language|German]] ({{lang|de|[[wikt:Frankreich|Frankreich]]}}), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ({{lang|nl|[[wikt:Frankrijk|Frankrijk]]}}), and [[Danish language|Danish]] ({{lang|da|[[wikt:Frankrig|Frankrig]]}}). Between the 5th and 9th centuries, the languages spoken by the [[Salian Franks]] in Belgium and the Netherlands evolved into [[Old Dutch]] (Old Low Franconian), while in [[Picardy]] and {{lang|fr|[[Île-de-France]]}} it was eventually outnumbered and replaced by [[Old French]] (the last stage of Latin in its evolution into French) as the dominant language.

The Frankish language as spoken before the [[Carolingian period]] is mostly reconstructed from Old French loanwords and from the Old Dutch language as recorded in the 6th to 12th centuries. A notable exception is the [[Bergakker inscription]], which may represent a primary record of 5th-century Frankish.

==Nomenclature==
{{main article|Name of the Franks}}
[[Germanic philology]] and [[German studies]] have their origins in the first half of the 19th century when [[Romanticism]] and Romantic thought heavily influenced the lexicon of the [[linguist]]s and [[philologist]]s of the time, including pivotal figures such as the [[Brothers Grimm]]. As a result, many contemporary linguists tried to incorporate their findings in an already existing historical framework of "[[stem duchies]]" and {{lang|de|Altstämme}} (lit. "old tribes", i.e. the six Germanic tribes then thought to have formed the "German nation" in the traditional German nationalism of the elites) resulting in a [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] which spoke of "[[Bavarii|Bavarian]]", "[[Saxons|Saxon]]", "[[Frisii|Frisian]]", "[[Thuringii|Thuringian]]", "[[Suebi|Swabian]]" and "[[Franks|Frankish]]" dialects. While this nomenclature became generally accepted in traditional Germanic philology, it has also been described as "inherently inaccurate" as these ancient ethnic boundaries (as understood in the 19th century) bore little or limited resemblance to the actual or historical linguistic situation of the Germanic languages. Among other problems, this traditional classification of the continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic dialects]] can suggest stronger ties between dialects than is linguistically warranted. The Franconian group is a well known example of this, with [[East Frankish|East Franconian]] being much more closely related to [[Bavarian language|Bavarian dialects]] than it is to [[Dutch language|Dutch]], which is traditionally placed in the [[Low Franconian]] sub-grouping and with which it was thought to have had a common, tribal origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|Hans-Werner Goetz: ''Die „Deutschen Stämme“ als Forschungsproblem''.|italic=unset}} In: {{lang|de|Heinrich Beck, Dieter Geuenich, [[Heiko Steuer]], Dietrich Hakelberg}} (ed.): {{lang|de|Zur Geschichte der Gleichung „germanisch-deutsch“|italic=yes}}. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mlpNMpXV9BEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA229  pp. 229–253] (p. 247).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a modern [[linguistics|linguistic]] context, the language of the early Franks is variously called "Old Frankish" or "Old Franconian" and refers to the language of the Franks prior to the advent of the [[High German consonant shift]], which took place between 600 and 700 CE. After this consonant shift the Frankish dialect diverges, with the dialects which would become modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] not undergoing the consonantal shift, while all others did so [[Rhenish fan|to varying degrees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|[http://www.rheinische-landeskunde.lvr.de/kompetenz/Sprache/rheinischer_sprachatlas/ Rheinischer Fächer – Karte des Landschaftsverband Rheinland]}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215032712/http://www.rheinische-landeskunde.lvr.de/kompetenz/Sprache/rheinischer_sprachatlas/ |date=February 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the distinction between [[Old Dutch]] and Old Frankish is largely negligible, with Old Dutch (also called [[Old Low Franconian]]) being the term used to differentiate between the affected and non-affected variants following the aforementioned Second Germanic consonant shift.&lt;ref name="mees"&gt;B.

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Germanic dialects ca. AD 1.png|270px|thumb|left|A proposed distribution of five primary Proto-Germanic dialect groups in Europe around the turn of the millenia:
{{legend|Blue|[[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] (→[[Proto-Norse]] by 300 CE)}}
{{legend|Red|[[North Sea Germanic]] (Ingvaeonic)}}
{{legend|Orange|[[Weser-Rhine Germanic]] (Istvaeonic)}}
{{legend|Yellow|[[Elbe Germanic]] (Irminonic)}}
{{legend|Green|[[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] (→[[Gothic language|Gothic]] by 300 CE)}}]]
The Germanic languages are traditionally divided into three groups: [[West Germanic languages|West]], [[East Germanic languages|East]] and [[North Germanic languages|North]] Germanic.&lt;ref name=Hawkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=John A.|chapter=Germanic languages|pages=68–76|editor=[[Bernard Comrie]]|title=The World's Major Languages|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1987|isbn=0-19-520521-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their exact relation is difficult to determine, and they remained mutually intelligible throughout the [[Migration Period]], rendering some individual varieties difficult to classify.

The language spoken by the Franks was part of the West Germanic language group, which had features from [[Proto-Germanic]] in the late [[Jastorf culture]] (ca. 1st century BC). The West Germanic group is characterized by a number of [[phonology|phonological]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] innovations not found in North and East Germanic.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Orrin W.|title=Old English and Its Closest Relatives|isbn=0-8047-2221-8|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Germanic varieties of the time are generally split into three dialect groups: [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]] (North Sea Germanic), [[Istvaeones|Istvaeonic]] (Weser-Rhine Germanic) and [[Irminones|Irminonic]] (Elbe Germanic). While each had its own distinct characteristics, there certainly must have still been a high degree of mutual intelligibility between these dialects. In fact, it is unclear whether the West Germanic continuum of this time period, or indeed Franconian itself, should still be considered a single language or that it should be considered a collection of similar dialects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graeme Davis (mediaevalist)|Graeme Davis]] (2006:154) notes "the languages of the Germanic group in the Old period are much closer than has previously been noted. Indeed it would not be inappropriate to regard them as dialects of one language." In: {{cite book

 |location=Bern
 |isbn=3-03910-270-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, it appears that the Frankish tribes, or the later Franks, fit primarily into the Istvaeonic dialect group, with certain Ingvaeonic influences towards the northwest (still seen in modern Dutch), and more Irminonic (High German) influences towards the southeast.

===Salian and Ripuarian Franks (210–500)===
The scholarly consensus concerning the [[Migration Period]] is that the Frankish identity emerged during the first half of the 3rd century out of various earlier, smaller [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] groups, including the [[Salian Franks|Salii]], [[Sicambri]], [[Chamavi]], [[Bructeri]], [[Chatti]], [[Chattuarii]], [[Ampsivarii]], [[Tencteri]], [[Ubii]], [[Batavians|Batavi]] and the [[Tungri]]. It is speculated that these tribes originally spoke a range of related Istvaeonic dialects in the West Germanic branch of Proto-Germanic. Sometime in the 4th or 5th centuries, it becomes appropriate to speak of Old Franconian rather than an Istvaeonic dialect of Proto-Germanic.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Bergakker runes.png|thumb|Bergakker inscription]]
Very little is known about what the language was like during this period. One older runic sentence (dating from around 425–450&amp;nbsp;AD) is on the [[Bergakker inscription|sword sheath of Bergakker]] which is either the singular direct attestation of the Old Franconian language or the earliest attestation of Old Low Franconian (Old Dutch) language. Another early sentence from the early 6th century AD (that is described as the earliest sentence in [[Old Dutch]] as well) is found in the [[Lex Salica]]. This phrase was used to free a [[serfdom|serf]]:

:"Maltho thi afrio lito"
:(I say, I free you, half-free.)

These are the earliest sentences yet found of Old Franconian.

[[File:Les Francs en Belgique romaine.svg|thumb|300px|The location of the Franks around 475 . "Les Francs rhénans" is the French term for "Ripuarian Franks".]]
During this early period, the Franks were divided politically and geographically into two groups: the [[Salian Franks]] and the [[Ripuarian Franks]]. The language (or set of dialects) spoken by the Salian Franks during this period is sometimes referred to as early "Old Low Franconian", and consisted of two groups: "Old West Low Franconian" and "Old East Low Franconian". The language (or set of dialects) spoken by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] are referred to just as Old Franconian dialects (or, by some, as Old Frankish dialects).

However, as already stated above, it may be more accurate to think of these dialects not as early Old Franconian but as Istvaeonic dialects in the West Germanic branch of Proto-Germanic.

===Frankish Empire (500–900)===
[[Image:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|300px|The Frankish conquests between 481 and 814]]

At around 500&amp;nbsp;AD the Franks probably spoke a range of related dialects and languages rather than a single uniform dialect or language.&lt;ref name=Green19&gt;{{cite book |title=The continental Saxons from the migration period to the tenth century: an ethnographic perspective |editor-first=D.H. |editor-last=Green |editor2=Frank Siegmund |publisher=Woodbridge |location=Suffolk |year=2003 |series=Studies in historical archaeoethnology, v.6 |page=19 |quote=There has never been such a thing as one Franconian language.

During the expansion into France and Germany, many Frankish people remained in the original core Frankish territories in the north (i.e. southern Netherlands, Flanders, a small part of northern France and the adjoining area in Germany centred on Cologne). The Franks united as a single group under Salian Frank leadership around 500 AD. Politically, the Ripuarian Franks existed as a separate group only until about 500&amp;nbsp;AD, after which they were subsumed into the Salian Franks. The Franks were united, but the various Frankish groups must have continued to live in the same areas, and speak the same dialects, although as a part of the growing [[Francia|Frankish Kingdom]].

There must have been a close relationship between the various Franconian dialects. There was also a close relationship between Old Low Franconian (i.e. Old Dutch) and its neighbouring [[Old Saxon]] and [[Old Frisian]] languages and dialects to the north and northeast, as well as the related [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon) dialects spoken in southern and eastern Britain.

A widening cultural divide grew between the Franks remaining in the north and the rulers far to the south.&lt;ref name="Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18"&gt;Milis, L.J.R., "A Long Beginning: The Low Countries Through the Tenth Century" in J.C.H. Blom &amp; E. Lamberts ''History of the Low Countries'', pp. 6–18, Berghahn Books, 1999. {{ISBN|978-1-84545-272-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Franks continued to reside in their original territories and to speak their original dialects and languages. It is not known what they called their language, but it is possible that they always called it "[[Diets]]" (i.e. "the people's language"), or something similar.

Philologists think of [[Old Dutch]] and [[Old West Low Franconian]] as being the same language. However, sometimes reference is made to a transition from the language spoken by the Salian Franks to [[Old Dutch]]. The language spoken by the Salian Franks must have developed significantly during the seven centuries from 200 to 900 AD. At some point the language spoken by the Franks must have become identifiably Dutch. Because Franconian texts are almost non-existent and [[Old Dutch]] texts scarce and fragmentary, it is difficult to determine when such a transition occurred, but it is thought to have happened by the end of the 9th century and perhaps earlier. By 900&amp;nbsp;AD the language spoken was recognisably an early form of Dutch, but that might also have been the case earlier.&lt;ref name="Verhaal"&gt;de Vries, Jan W., Roland Willemyns and Peter Burger, ''Het verhaal van een taal'', Amsterdam: Prometheus, 2003, pp. 12, 21–27. On page 25: "''…Een groot deel van het noorden van Frankrijk was in die tijd tweetalig Germaans-Romaans, en gedurende een paar eeuwen handhaafde het Germaans zich er. Maar in de zevende eeuw begon er opnieuw een romaniseringsbeweging en door de versmelting van beide volken werd de naam Franken voortaan ook gebezigd voor de Romanen ten noordern van de Loire. Frankisch of François werd de naam de (Romaanse) taal. De nieuwe naam voor de Germaanse volkstaal hield hiermee verband: Diets of Duits, dat wil zeggen "volks", "volkstaal".'' [At that time a large part of the north of France was bilingual Germanic/Romance, and for a couple of centuries Germanic held its own. But in the seventh century a wave of romanisation began anew and because of the merging of the two peoples the name for the Franks was used for the Romance speakers north of the Loire. "Frankonian/Frankish" or "François" became the name of the (Romance) language. The new name for the Germanic vernacular was related to this: "Diets"" or "Duits", i.e. "of the people", "the people's language"]. Page 27: "''…Aan het einde van de negende eeuw kan er zeker van Nederlands gesproken worden; hoe long daarvoor dat ook het geval was, kan niet met zekerheid worden uitgemaakt.''" [It can be said with certainty that Dutch was being spoken at the end of the 9th century; how long that might have been the case before that cannot be determined with certainty.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Dutch]] made the transition to [[Middle Dutch]] around 1150. A Dutch-French language boundary came into existence (but this was originally south of where it is today).&lt;ref name="Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Verhaal"/&gt; Even though living in the original territory of the Franks, these Franks seem to have broken with the [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] "Frank" around the 9th century. By this time the Frankish identity had changed from an ethnic identity to a national identity, becoming localized and confined to the modern ''[[Franconia]]'' in Germany and principally to the French province of ''[[Île-de-France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;van der Wal, M., ''Geschiedenis van het Nederlands'', 1992 {{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaul===
The Franks expanded south into [[Gaul]]. Although the Franks would eventually conquer all of Gaul, speakers of Old Franconian apparently expanded in sufficient numbers only into northern Gaul to have a linguistic effect. For several centuries, northern Gaul was a bilingual territory ([[Vulgar Latin]] and Franconian). The language used in writing, in government and by the Church was Latin. Eventually, the Franks who had settled more to the south of this area in northern Gaul started adopting the [[Vulgar Latin]] of the local population. This [[Vulgar Latin]] language acquired the name of the people who came to speak it (Frankish or ''Français''); north of the French-Dutch language boundary, the language was no longer referred to as "Frankish" (if it ever was referred to as such) but rather came to be referred to as "[[Diets]]", i.e. the "people's language".&lt;ref name="Verhaal"/&gt; [[Urban T. Holmes, Jr.|Urban T. Holmes]] has proposed that a Germanic language continued to be spoken as a second tongue by public officials in western [[Austrasia]] and [[Neustria]] as late as the 850s, and that it completely disappeared as a spoken language from these regions only during the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Urban T. Holmes, Jr.|U. T. Holmes]], A. H. Schutz (1938), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jbjX4ebc2lsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=history+of+french+language&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jRjOTtqdDNPR4QTr1pQ8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20french%20language&amp;f=false A History of the French Language]'', p. 29, Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers, {{ISBN|0-8196-0191-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German Franconia===
{{further|Franconia}}
The Franks also expanded their rule southeast into parts of Germany. Their language had some influence on local dialects, especially for terms relating to warfare. 
However, since the language of both the administration and the Church was Latin, this unification did not lead to the development of a supra-regional variety of Franconian nor a standardized German language. At the same time that the Franks were expanding southeast into what is now southern Germany, there were linguistic changes taking place in the region. The [[High German consonant shift]] (or [[second Germanic consonant shift]]) was a phonological development ([[sound change]]) that took place in the southern parts of the West Germanic dialect continuum in several phases, probably beginning between the 3rd and 5th centuries AD, and was almost complete before the earliest written records in the High German language were made in the 9th century. The resulting language, [[Old High German]], can be neatly contrasted with [[Low Franconian]], which for the most part did not experience the shift.

==Franconian languages==
{{main article|Franconian languages}}
The set of dialects of the Franks who continued to live in their original territory in the Low Countries eventually developed in three different ways.
* The dialects spoken by the Salian Franks in the Low Countries ([[Old Dutch]], also referred to as [[Old West Low Franconian]]) developed into the [[Dutch language]], which itself has a number of dialects. [[Afrikaans]] branched off Dutch.
* The [[Old East Low Franconian]] dialects are represented today in [[Limburgish]], which is by some (especially Germans) referred to as [[Low Rhenish]] or [[Meuse-Rhenish]]. [[Limburgish]] itself has a number of dialects. It is by some considered to be a separate language and by others simply a dialect of Dutch.
* It is speculated that the dialects originally spoken by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] in Germany possibly developed into, or were subsumed under, the German dialects called the [[Central Franconian dialects]] ([[Ripuarian Franconian]], [[Moselle Franconian]] and [[Rhenish Franconian]]). These languages and dialects were later affected by serious language changes (such as the [[High German consonant shift]]), which resulted in the emergence of dialects that are now considered German dialects. Today, the Central Franconian dialects are spoken in the core territory of the Ripuarian Franks. Although there may not be definite proof to say that the dialects of the Ripuarian Franks (about which very little is known) developed into the [[Central Franconian dialects]], there are—apart from mere probability—some pieces of evidence, most importantly the development ''-hs'' → ''ss'' and the loss of ''n'' before spirants, which is found throughout Central Franconian but nowhere else in [[High German]]. Compare Luxembourgish ''Uess'' ("ox"), Dutch ''os'', German ''Ochse''; and (dated) Luxembourgish ''Gaus'' ("goose"), Old Dutch ''gās'', German ''Gans''. The language spoken by [[Charlemagne]] was probably the dialect that later developed into the Ripuarian Franconian dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=R.E. | last=Keller | title=The Language of the Franks | journal=Bulletin of the John Rylands Library of Manchester | volume=47 |number=1 | year=1964 | pages=101–122, esp. 122}} {{cite book | first=W.W. | last=Chambers | first2=J.R. | last2=Wilkie | title=A short history of the German language | year=1970 | location=London | publisher=Methuen | page=33}} {{harvnb|McKitterick|2008|p=318}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Frankish Empire later extended throughout neighbouring France and Germany. The language of the Franks had some influence on the local languages (especially in France), but never took hold as a standard language because Latin was the international language at the time. However, the language of the Franks did not develop into the [[lingua franca]].

The Franks conquered adjoining territories of Germany (including the territory of the [[Allemanni]]). The Frankish legacy survives in these areas, for example, in the names of the city of [[Frankfurt]] and the area of [[Franconia]]. 
The Franks brought their language with them from their original territory and, as in France, it must have had an effect on the local dialects and languages. However, it is relatively difficult for linguists today to determine what features of these dialects are due to Frankish influence, because the latter was in large parts obscured, or even overwhelmed, by later developments.

==Influence on Old French and Middle Latin==
Most [[List of French words of Germanic origin|French words of Germanic origin]] came from Frankish (some others are English loanwords&lt;ref&gt;Besides modern loan words, English also influenced French in earlier times, with [[Old English]] for example replacing the Latin words for the four cardinal directions: ''nord'' "north", ''sud'' "south", ''est'' "east" and ''ouest'' "west".&lt;/ref&gt;), often replacing the [[Latin]] word which would have been used. It is estimated that modern French took approximately 1000 stem words from Old Franconian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/508379/Romance-languages/74738/Vocabulary-variations?anchor=ref603727&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these words were concerned with agriculture (e.g. {{lang-fr|jardin}} "garden"), war (e.g. {{lang-fr|guerre}} "war") or social organization (e.g. {{lang-fr|baron}} "baron"). Old Franconian has introduced the modern French word for the nation, [[France]] ([[Francia]]), meaning "land of the Franks", as well as possibly the name for the Paris region, [[Île-de-France]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The influence of Franconian on French is decisive for the birth of the early [[langues d'oïl|Langue d'oïl]] compared to the other [[Romance languages]], that appeared later such as [[Occitan language|Langue d'oc]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], etc., because its influence was greater than the respective influence of [[Gothic language|Visigothic]] and [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]] (both [[Germanic languages]]) on the ''langue d'oc'', the Romance languages of Iberia, and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Not all of these loanwords have been retained in modern French. French has also passed on words of Franconian origin to other Romance languages, and to English.

Old Franconian has also left many [[etymon|etyma]] in the different Northern [[Langues d'oïl]]s such as [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Champenois]], Bas-[[Lorrain dialect|Lorrain]] and [[Walloon language|Walloon]], more than in Common French, and not always the same ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[:wa:Etimolodjeye francike#Djivêye di mots walons d' etimolodjeye francike|See a list of Walloon names derived from Old Franconian]].&lt;/ref&gt;

See below a non-exhaustive list of French words of Frankish origin. An asterisk prefixing a term indicates a [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed form]] of the Frankish word. Most Franconian words with the phoneme ''w'' changed it to ''gu'' when entering Old French and other [[Romance languages]]; however, the northern [[langue d'oïl]] dialects such as Picard, Northern Norman, Walloon, Burgundian, Champenois and Bas-Lorrain retained the [w] or turned it into [v]. Perhaps the best known example is the Franconian *''werra'' ("war" &lt; Old Northern French ''werre'', compare Old High German ''werre'' "quarrel"), which entered modern French as ''guerre'' and ''guerra'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Other examples include "gant" ("gauntlet", from *''want'') and "garder" ("to guard", from *''wardōn''). Franconian words starting with ''s'' before another consonant developed it into ''es''- (e.g. Franconian ''skirm'' and Old French ''escremie'' &gt; Old Italian ''scrimia'' &gt; Modern French ''escrime'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/escrime CNRTL, "escrime"]&lt;/ref&gt;

| *''bāst'' "marriage"&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language'', s.v.

OFris ''bost'' marriage […]". Further, MDu had a related expression ''basture'' "whore, prostitute". However, the mainstream view sees this word as a formation built off of OFr ''fils de bast'' "bastard, lit. son conceived on a packsaddle", very much like OFr ''coitart'' "conceived on a blanket", G ''Bankert, Bänkling'' "bench child", LG ''Mantelkind'' "mantle child", and ON ''hrísungr'' "conceived in the brushwood".

===Old French===
Franconian speech habits are also responsible{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} for the replacement of Latin ''cum'' ("with") with ''[[wikt:od#Old French|od]]'' ← ''apud'' "at", then with ''[[wikt:avuec#Old French|avuec]]'' ← ''apud hoc'' "at it" ≠ Italian, Spanish ''con'') in Old French (Modern French ''avec''), and for the preservation of Latin nominative ''homo'' "man" as an impersonal pronoun: cf. ''homme'' ← ''hominem'' "man (accusative)" and Old French ''hum, hom, om'' → modern ''on'', "[[One (pronoun)|one]]" (compare Dutch ''man'' "man" and ''men'', "one").

===Middle English===
[[Middle English]] also adopted many words with Franconian roots from Old French; e.g. ''random'' (via Old French ''randon'', Old French verb ''randir'', from ''*rant'' "a running"), ''standard'' (via Old French ''estandart'', from ''*standhard'' "stand firm"), ''scabbard'' (via Anglo-French *''escauberc'', from *''skar-berg''), ''grape'', ''stale'', ''[[marches|march]]'' (via Old French ''marche'', from *''marka'') among others.

A '''hairnet''', or sometimes simply a '''net''' or '''caul''', is a small, often elasticised, fine net worn over long hair to hold it in place. It is worn to keep hair contained. A [[Snood (headgear)|snood]] is similar but a looser fit and with a much coarser mesh and noticeably thicker yarn.

==History==
The oldest evidence of the hair net is from the 3300-year-old grave of a Danish girl dubbed the [[Egtved Girl]], later examples are found in [[Ancient Greece]]
[[File:Ardenhaarnetz.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of an Iron Age woman's hair net.]]

Hairnets were worn from the 13th century onwards in [[Germany]] and [[England]] and are shown in illustrations from this period often worn with a [[wimple]]. They were made from extremely fine silk and edged with bands of either finger-weaving or tablet-weaving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/nicolaa5/articles/hairnet.htm Netting for Hairnets] Susan Carroll-Clark, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Food service workers often wear it to prevent hair from contaminating the food.

Hairnets are part of normal attire for female horse riders and are worn in most equestrian disciplines, including dressage, eventing, show jumping, and hunting. Organizations such as the [[Pony Club]] encourage their young members to become accustomed to wearing hairnets when around horses, not only to ensure a neat and elegant appearance, but also to eliminate any danger of scalping should the rider fall off and the horse tread on loose hair.

Ballet dancers typically wear a [[bun (hairstyle)|bun]] at the crown of the head covered in a fine hairnet.

==In culture==
[[Ena Sharples]], a character in the UK soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'' between 1960 and 1980, was famous for wearing a hairnet;{{cn|date=February 2017}} the original hairnet was brought in by the character's actress, [[Violet Carson]], to stop the make-up women from altering her hair. [[Gang member]]s in the United States and Mexico wear hairnets as part of their [[Gang colors|uniforms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapdonline.org/get_informed/content_basic_view/23468 How Are Gangs Identified?] The Los Angeles Police Department.

'''''He Who Gets Slapped''''' is a [[1924 in film|1924]] American [[silent film|silent]] [[tragedy]] and [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] starring [[Lon Chaney]], [[Norma Shearer]], and [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; November 12, 1924, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; November 8, 1924, page 178.&lt;/ref&gt; and directed by [[Victor Sjöström]]. The film is based on the Russian play ''Тот, кто получает пощёчины'' ("He Who Gets Slapped", transliterated as ''Tot, kto polučájet poščóčiny'') by playwright [[Leonid Andreyev]], which was published in 1914 and in English, as ''He Who Gets Slapped'', in 1922.&lt;ref name=IBDB&gt;[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/he-who-gets-slapped-12746 ''He Who Gets Slapped''] at the Internet Broadway Database, retrieved Oct. 9, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The Russian original was made into a Russian movie in 1916.

''He Who Gets Slapped'' was the first film produced entirely by the newly formed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It was not, however, MGM's first released movie, as the film was held until the Christmas season when higher attendance was expected. The movie was highly profitable for the fledgling MGM, and was critically hailed upon release. It was also the first film to feature [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] as the mascot for MGM. Previously, Leo appeared in the logo for [[Goldwyn Pictures Corporation]] in 1916, and the trademark was retained by MGM when the companies merged.

The film was important in the careers of Chaney, Shearer, Gilbert, and Sjöström. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|publisher=|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Paul Beaumont ([[Lon Chaney]]) is a scientist who labored for years alone to prove his radical theories on the origin of mankind.  Baron Regnard ([[Marc McDermott]]) becomes his patron, enabling him to do research while living in his mansion. One day, Beaumont announces to his beloved wife Marie and the Baron that he has proved all his theories and is ready to present them before the Academy of the Sciences. He leaves the arrangements to the Baron. However, after Beaumont goes to sleep, Marie steals his key, opens the safe containing his papers, and gives them to the baron.

On the appointed day, Paul travels to the Academy with the Baron. He is aghast when the Baron, instead of introducing him, takes credit for Paul's work himself. After he recovers from the shock, Paul confronts him in front of everyone, but the Baron tells them that Paul is merely his assistant and slaps him. All of the academicians laugh at his humiliation. Paul later seeks comfort from his wife, but she brazenly admits she and the baron are having an affair and calls him a clown. Paul leaves them.

Five years pass by. Paul is now a clown calling himself "HE who gets slapped", the star attraction of a small circus near [[Paris]]. His act consists of his getting slapped every evening by other clowns, and includes Paul pretending to present in front of the Academy of Science.

Another of the performers is Bezano ([[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]]), a daredevil horseback rider. Consuelo ([[Norma Shearer]]), the daughter of the impoverished Count Mancini, applies to join his act. Bezano falls in love with Consuelo, as does Paul. Consuelo and her father, however, are planning to restore the family's fortunes with a marriage to her father's wealthy friend.

One night, during HE's performance, he spots the baron in the audience. The baron goes backstage and begins flirting with Consuelo, which she does not like. The next day, the baron sends Consuelo jewelry, but she rejects it.

When her father leaves for a meeting with the baron, Bezano takes Consuelo out to the countryside for a romantic meeting, where they declare their love for each other. Meanwhile, Count Mancini convinces the reluctant baron that the only way he can have Consuelo is by marrying her. The baron discards the heartbroken Marie, leaving her with a check.

Later, HE admits to Consuelo he, too, is in love with her. She thinks he is kidding and laughingly slaps him. They are interrupted by the baron and the count, who inform Consuelo she will marry the baron after the night's performance. When HE tries to interfere, he is locked in an adjoining room, where an angry lion is kept in a cage. He moves the cage so that, when he carefully opens it, only the door to the next room prevents the lion from escaping. HE re-enters the other room through the only other entrance (making sure to lock it behind him) and reveals his identity to the baron. HE threatens the baron, but the count stabs him with a sword.

The baron and the count try to leave but, finding the main entrance locked, open the side door, releasing the lion. The animal kills the count, then the baron. However, the lion tamer shows up and saves HE from the same fate. HE goes on stage and collapses. He assures Consuelo he is happy and that she will be happy, before dying in her arms.

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Intellectual property''' ('''IP''') is a category of [[property]] that includes intangible creations of the human intellect, and primarily encompasses [[copyright]]s, [[patent]]s, and [[trademark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes other types of rights, such as [[trade secret]]s, [[publicity rights]], [[moral rights]], and rights against [[unfair competition]]. Artistic works like music and literature, as well as some discoveries, inventions, words, phrases, symbols, and designs, can all be protected as intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/intel1_e.htm |title=What are intellectual property rights? |website=World Trade Organization |publisher=World Trade Organization |access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Intellectual property", ''Black's Law Dictionary'', 10th ed. (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until the 19th century that the term "intellectual property" began to be used, and not until the late 20th century that it became commonplace in the majority of the world.&lt;ref name="Lemley 2005"&gt;"property as a common descriptor of the field probably traces to the foundation of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) by the United Nations." in [[Mark A. Lemley]], [http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/abstracts/83/83Lemley.pdf ''Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226035349/http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/abstracts/83/83Lemley.pdf |date=2009-02-26 }}, Texas Law Review, 2005, Vol. 83:1031, page 1033, footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a large variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create{{snd}}usually for a limited period of time.  This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to profit from the information and intellectual goods they create.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}} These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.&lt;ref&gt;Rod Falvey and Neil Foster (2006): “The Role of Intellectual Property Rights in Technology Transfer and Economic Growth”: Theory and Evidence, In cooperation with Olga Memedovic UNITED NATIONS INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION (UNIDO),  available: https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/2009-04/Role_of_intellectual_property_rights_in_technology_transfer_and_economic_growth_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods.  Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is "indivisible" – an unlimited number of people can "consume" an intellectual good without it being depleted.  Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation – a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|pp=18–19}}

==History==
{{Main|History of copyright law|History of patent law}}
[[File:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|The [[Statute of Anne]] came into force in 1710]]

The [[Statute of Monopolies]] (1624) and the British [[Statute of Anne]] (1710) are seen as the origins of [[patent law]] and [[copyright]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brad |first=Sherman |author2=Lionel Bently |title=The making of modern intellectual property law: the British experience, 1760–1911 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |page=207 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=u2aMRA-eF1gC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-0-521-56363-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; firmly establishing the concept of intellectual property.

The first known use of the term ''intellectual property'' dates to 1769, when a piece published in the ''[[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'' used the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | intellectual property }} (Citing ''Monthly Review'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=cMsvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA290#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false vol. 41. p. 290] (1769): "What a niggard this Doctor is of his own, and how profuse he is of other people's intellectual property.")&lt;/ref&gt; The first clear example of modern usage goes back as early as 1808, when it was used as a heading title in a collection of essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | intellectual property }} (Citing ''Medical Repository Of Original Essays And Intelligence'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ij9JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA303 vol. 11. p. 303] (1808): "New-England Association in favour of Inventors and Discoverers, and particularly for the Protection of intellectual Property.")&lt;/ref&gt;

The German equivalent was used with the founding of the [[North German Confederation]] whose [[constitution]] granted legislative power over the protection of intellectual property (''Schutz des geistigen Eigentums'') to the confederation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verfassungen.de/de/de67-18/verfassung67-i.htm 'Article 4 No. 6 of the Constitution of 1867 (German)'] Hastings Law Journal, Vol. 52, p. 1255, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; When the administrative secretariats established by the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] (1883) and the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] (1886) merged in 1893, they located in Berne, and also adopted the term intellectual property in their new combined title, the [[United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property]].

The organization subsequently relocated to Geneva in 1960, and was succeeded in 1967 with the establishment of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) by [[Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization|treaty]] as an agency of the [[United Nations]]. According to legal scholar [[Mark Lemley]], it was only at this point that the term really began to be used in the United States (which had not been a party to the Berne Convention),&lt;ref name="Lemley 2005" /&gt; and it did not enter popular usage there until passage of the [[Bayh-Dole Act]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Lemley, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=582602 "Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding"] (Abstract); see Table 1: 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The history of patents does not begin with inventions, but rather with royal grants by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603) for monopoly privileges... Approximately 200 years after the end of Elizabeth's reign, however, a patent represents a legal [[right]] obtained by an inventor providing for exclusive control over the production and sale of his mechanical or scientific invention... [demonstrating] the evolution of patents from royal prerogative to common-law doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;Mossoff, A. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=863925 'Rethinking the Development of Patents: An Intellectual History, 1550–1800,'] Hastings Law Journal, Vol. 52, p. 1255, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term can be found used in an October 1845 [[Massachusetts Circuit Court]] ruling in the patent case ''Davoll et al. v. Brown.'', in which Justice Charles L. Woodbury wrote that "only in this way can we protect intellectual property, the labors of the mind, productions and interests are as much a man's own...as the wheat he cultivates, or the flocks he rears."&lt;ref&gt;''1 Woodb. &amp; M. 53, 3 West.L.J. 151, 7 F.Cas. 197, No. 3662, 2 Robb.Pat.Cas. 303, Merw.Pat.Inv. 414''&lt;/ref&gt; The statement that "discoveries are..property" goes back earlier. Section 1 of the [[French law of 1791]] stated, "All new discoveries are the property of the author; to assure the inventor the property and temporary enjoyment of his discovery, there shall be delivered to him a patent for five, ten or fifteen years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladas.com/Patents/USPatentHistory.html |title=Patent Archives – Ladas &amp; Parry LLP |publisher=Ladas.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115040700/http://www.ladas.com/Patents/USPatentHistory.html |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, [[France|French]] author A. Nion mentioned ''propriété intellectuelle'' in his ''Droits civils des auteurs, artistes et inventeurs'', published in 1846.

Until recently, the purpose of intellectual property law was to give as little protection as possible in order to encourage innovation. Historically, therefore, they were granted only when they were necessary to encourage invention, limited in time and scope.&lt;ref name="Mark A. Lemley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/tlr83&amp;div=30&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals |title=Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding |author=Mark A. Lemley |publisher=Heinonline.org |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly as a result of knowledge being traditionally viewed as a public good, in order to allow its extensive dissemination and improvement thereof.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist; (October 20th 2005): “The Liquidity of Innovation”; How the new market for intellectual property is changing the technology industry, available; https://www.economist.com/node/5015365&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept's origins can potentially be traced back further. [[Jewish law]] includes several considerations whose effects are similar to those of modern intellectual property laws, though the notion of intellectual creations as property does not seem to exist – notably the principle of Hasagat Ge'vul (unfair encroachment) was used to justify limited-term publisher (but not author) copyright in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/copyright1.html |title=Jewish Law – Articles ("Jewish Law and Copyright") |publisher=Jlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 500 BCE, the government of the Greek state of [[Sybaris]] offered one year's patent "to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Anthon, A Classical Dictionary: Containing an Account of the Principal Proper Names Mentioned in Ancient Authors, and Intended to Elucidate All the Important Points Connected with the Geography, History, Biography, Mythology, and Fine Arts of the Greek and Romans. Together with an Account of Coins, Weights, and Measures, with Tabular Values of the Same 1273 (Harper &amp; Brothers 1841). See also "The first patent law was enacted in Sybaris, a city in the South of Italy, before the Roman domination; (…) The law was mentioned by Atheneus, an ancient writer..." in Takenaka, Toshiko (2013). Intellectual Property in Common Law and Civil Law. Edward Elgar Publishing. p. 419. (chapter by Mario Franzosi).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jean-Frédéric Morin, "the global intellectual property regime is currently in the midst of a paradigm shift".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morin|first= Jean-Frédéric|title= Paradigm shift in the global IP regime: The agency of academics, Review of International Political Economy, vol 21-2, 2014, p.275 |url=http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2014_paradigm_shift_agency_of_academics.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, up until the early 2000s the global IP regime used to be dominated by high standards of protection characteristic of IP laws from Europe or the United States, with a vision that uniform application of these standards over every country and to several fields with little consideration over social, cultural or environmental values or of the national level of economic development. Morin argues that "the emerging discourse of the global IP regime advocates for greater policy flexibility and greater access to knowledge, especially for developing countries." Indeed, with the Development Agenda adopted by WIPO in 2007, a set of 45 recommendations to adjust WIPO’s activities to the specific needs of developing countries and aim to reduce distortions especially on issues such as patients’ access to medicines, Internet users’ access to information, farmers’ access to seeds, programmers’ access to source codes or students’ access to scientific articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morin|first= Jean-Frédéric|title= Paradigm shift in the global IP regime: The agency of academics, Review of International Political Economy, vol 21-2, 2014, p.275 |url=http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2014_paradigm_shift_agency_of_academics.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this paradigm shift has not yet manifested itself in concrete legal reforms at the international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morin|first= Jean-Frédéric|title= Paradigm shift in the global IP regime: The agency of academics, Review of International Political Economy, vol 21-2, 2014, p.275 |url=http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2014_paradigm_shift_agency_of_academics.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, it is based on these background that the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement requires members of the WTO to set minimum standards of legal protection, but its objective to have a “one-fits-all” protection law on Intellectual Property has been viewed with controversies regarding differences in the development level of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roisah|first=Kholis|date=2017-12-26|title=Understanding Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement: From Hard and Soft Law Perspective|url=http://pasca.unhas.ac.id/ojs/index.php/halrev/article/view/1153|journal=Hasanuddin Law Review|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=277–289|doi=10.20956/halrev.v3i3.1153|issn=2442-9899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the controversy, the agreement has extensively incorporated intellectual property rights into the global trading system for the first time in 1995, and has prevailed as the most comprehensive agreement reached by the world.&lt;ref&gt;WTO (2013): Intellectual Property; Responding to least developed countries’ special needs in intellectual property; https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/ldc_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property rights==
Intellectual property rights include [[patent]]s, [[copyright]], [[industrial design right]]s, [[trademark]]s, [[plant variety rights]], [[trade dress]], [[geographical indications]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/treaties/text.jsp?file_id=288514 Article 1(2) of the Paris Convention]: "The protection of industrial property has as its object patents, utility models, industrial designs, trademarks, service marks, trade names, indications of source or appellations of origin, and the repression of unfair competition."&lt;/ref&gt; and in some jurisdictions [[trade secret]]s. There are also more specialized or derived varieties of ''[[sui generis]]'' exclusive rights, such as circuit design rights (called [[mask work]] rights in the US) and [[supplementary protection certificate]]s for pharmaceutical products (after expiry of a patent protecting them) and [[database rights]] (in [[EC law|European law]]). The term "industrial property" is sometimes used to refer to a large subset of intellectual property rights including patents, trademarks, industrial designs, utility models, service marks, trade names, and geographical indications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/paris/index.html|title=Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patents===
{{Main|Patent}}
A [[patent]] is a form of right granted by the government to an inventor or their successor-in-title, giving the owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell, and importing an [[invention]] for a limited period of time, in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem, which may be a product or a process and generally has to fulfill three main requirements: it has to be new, not obvious and there needs to be an industrial applicability.&lt;ref name="WIPO Handbook Ch 2"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/about-ip/en/iprm/pdf/ch2.pdf WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook: Policy, Law and Use. Chapter 2: Fields of Intellectual Property Protection] WIPO 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} To enrich the body of knowledge and stimulate innovation, it is an obligation for patent owners to disclose valuable information about their inventions to the public.&lt;ref name="wipo.int"&gt;WIPO (2008); “What is Intellectual Property” Handbook: WIPO Publication No. 450(E) {{ISBN|978-92-805-1555-0}}, available: http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/intproperty/450/wipo_pub_450.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Industrial design right}}
An [[industrial design right]] (sometimes called "design right" or ''design patent'') protects the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian. An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value. An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft. Generally speaking, it is what makes a product look appealing, and as such, it increases the commercial value of goods.&lt;ref name="wipo.int"/&gt;

===Plant varieties===
{{Main|Plant breeders' rights}}
[[Plant breeders' rights]] or plant variety rights are the rights to commercially use a new variety of a plant. The variety must amongst others be novel and distinct and for registration the evaluation of propagating material of the variety is considered.

===Trademarks===
{{Main|Trademark}}
A [[trademark]] is a recognizable [[sign (semiotics)|sign]], [[design]] or [[expression (language)|expression]] which distinguishes [[Good (economics)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] of a particular trader from the similar products or services of other traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/definitions.jsp |title=Trademark, Patent, or Copyright? |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-about/t-whatis.htm |title=A trade mark is a sign which can distinguish your goods and services from those of your competitors (you may refer to your trade mark as your "brand"). |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patentamt.de/english/trade_marks/index.html |title=Trade marks identify the goods and services of particular traders.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade dress===
{{Main|Trade dress}}
[[Trade dress]] is a legal term of art that generally refers to characteristics of the visual and aesthetic appearance of a product or its packaging (or even the design of a building) that signify the source of the product to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert P. |last=Merges |first2=Peter S. |last2=Menell |first3=Mark A. |last3=Lemley |title=Intellectual Property in the New Technological Age |edition=4th rev. |year=2007 |location=New York |publisher=Wolters Kluwer |isbn=978-0-7355-6989-8 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade secrets===
{{Main|Trade secret}}
A [[trade secret]] is a [[formula]], practice, process, [[design]], instrument, [[pattern]], or compilation of [[information]] which is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable, by which a [[business]] can obtain an economic advantage over competitors and customers. There is no formal government protection granted; each business must take measures to guard its own trade secrets (e.g., Formula of its soft drinks is a trade secret for Coca-Cola.)

==Object of intellectual property law==
The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods for consumers.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}}  To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time.  Because they can then profit from them, this gives economic incentive for their creation.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}}  The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods.  Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is indivisible – an unlimited number of people can "consume" an intellectual good without it being depleted.  Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation – while a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of information and intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent their wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|pp=18–19}}

By exchanging limited exclusive rights for disclosure of inventions and creative works, society and the patentee/copyright owner mutually benefit, and an incentive is created for inventors and authors to create and disclose their work. Some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be "absolute protection". "If some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation, they reason, more is better. The thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions".&lt;ref name="Mark A. Lemley" /&gt; This absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of "real" property, typically adopting its law and rhetoric. Other recent developments in intellectual property law, such as the [[Leahy-Smith America Invents Act|America Invents Act]], stress international harmonization. Recently there has also been much debate over the desirability of using intellectual property rights to protect cultural heritage, including intangible ones, as well as over risks of [[commodification]] derived from this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farah |first1=Paolo Davide |last2=Tremolada |first2=Riccardo |title=Desirability of Commodification of Intangible Cultural Heritage: The Unsatisfying Role of Intellectual Property Rights |journal=Transnational Dispute Management |date=March 15, 2014 |volume=11 |issue=2 |ssrn=2472339 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue still remains open in legal scholarship.

===Financial incentive===
These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated [[research and development]] costs.&lt;ref name="MonoProf"&gt;[http://www.uclan.ac.uk/schools/school_of_health/research_projects/files/health_innova_IPR_reform_report.pdf Prudential Reasons for IPR Reform], University of Melbourne, Doris Schroeder and Peter Singer, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States Article I Section 8 Clause 8 of the Constitution, commonly called the Patent and Copyright Clause, reads; "[The Congress shall have power] 'To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright &amp; Fair Use|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/law/us-constitution/|website=Stanford University Libraries|accessdate=26 June 2017|date=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ”Some commentators, such as [[David K. Levine|David Levine]] and [[Michele Boldrin]], dispute this justification.&lt;ref name='R000000'&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=David |authorlink=David K.

In 2013 the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office approximated that the worth of intellectual property to the U.S. economy is more than US $5 trillion and creates employment for an estimated 18 million American people. The value of intellectual property is considered similarly high in other developed nations, such as those in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Chemotherapy That Costs $70,000 in the U.S. Costs $2,500 in India |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/why-chemotherapy-that-costs-70-000-in-the-us-costs-2-500-in-india/274847/ |work=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |accessdate=18 April 2013 |author=Thomas Bollyky |date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, IP has become a recognised asset class for use in [[Pension led funding|pension-led funding]] and other types of business finance. However, in 2013, the UK Intellectual Property Office stated: "There are millions of intangible business assets whose value is either not being leveraged at all, or only being leveraged inadvertently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brassell, King |first=Martin, Kelvin |title=Banking on IP? |year=2013 |publisher=The Intellectual Property Office |location=Newport, Wales |isbn=978-1-908908-86-5 |page=15 |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipresearch-bankingip.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic growth===
The WIPO treaty and several related international agreements underline that the protection of intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining economic growth. The ''WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook'' gives two reasons for intellectual property laws:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One is to give statutory expression to the moral and economic rights of creators in their creations and the rights of the public in access to those creations. The second is to promote, as a deliberate act of Government policy, creativity and the dissemination and application of its results and to encourage fair trading which would contribute to economic and social development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/about-ip/en/iprm/pdf/ch1.pdf p. 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]] (ACTA) states that "effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth across all industries and globally".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/assets/pdfs/acta-crc_apr15-2011_eng.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507132516/http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/assets/pdfs/acta-crc_apr15-2011_eng.pdf|date=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists estimate that two-thirds of the value of large businesses in the United States can be traced to intangible assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonecon.com/docs/studies/0807_thevalueofip.pdf |format=PDF |title=Economic Effects of Intellectual Property-Intensive Manufacturing in the United States |author1=Robert J.

===Morality===
According to Article 27 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], "everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United Nations |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the relationship between intellectual property and [[human rights]] is a complex one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WIPO – The World Intellectual Property Organization |title=Human Rights and Intellectual Property: An Overview |url=http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022125749/http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |archivedate=October 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there are moral arguments for intellectual property.

The arguments that justify intellectual property fall into three major categories. Personality theorists believe intellectual property is an extension of an individual. Utilitarians believe that intellectual property stimulates social progress and pushes people to further innovation. Lockeans argue that intellectual property is justified based on deservedness and hard work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intellectual-property/#LocJusIntPro|title=Intellectual Property|last=Moore|first=Adam|date=2014|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various moral justifications for private property can be used to argue in favor of the morality of intellectual property, such as:

# ''Natural Rights/Justice Argument'': this argument is based on Locke's idea that a person has a natural right over the labour and/or products which is produced by his/her body. Appropriating these products is viewed as unjust. Although Locke had never explicitly stated that natural right applied to products of the mind,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald V. Bettig. "Critical Perspectives on the History and Philosophy of Copyright" in Copyrighting Culture: The Political Economy of Intellectual Property, by Ronald V. Bettig. (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1996), 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible to apply his argument to intellectual property rights, in which it would be unjust for people to misuse another's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 415–416.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's argument for intellectual property is based upon the idea that laborers have the right to control that which they create. They argue that we own our bodies which are the laborers, this right of ownership extends to what we create. Thus, intellectual property ensures this right when it comes to production.
# ''Utilitarian-Pragmatic Argument'': according to this rationale, a society that protects private property is more effective and prosperous than societies that do not. Innovation and invention in 19th century America has been attributed to the development of the [[patent]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 416.&lt;/ref&gt; By providing innovators with "durable and tangible return on their investment of time, labor, and other resources", intellectual property rights seek to maximize social utility.&lt;ref name="Spinello 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spinello |first=Richard A. |title=Intellectual property rights |journal=Library Hi Tech |date=January 2007 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=12–22 |doi=10.1108/07378830710735821}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 3, 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The presumption is that they promote public welfare by encouraging the "creation, production, and distribution of intellectual works".&lt;ref name="Spinello 2007" /&gt; Utilitarians argue that without intellectual property there would be a lack of incentive to produce new ideas. Systems of protection such as Intellectual property optimize social utility.
# ''"Personality" Argument'': this argument is based on a quote from [[Hegel]]: "Every man has the right to turn his will upon a thing or make the thing an object of his will, that is to say, to set aside the mere thing and recreate it as his own".&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 417.&lt;/ref&gt; European intellectual property law is shaped by this notion that ideas are an "extension of oneself and of one's personality".&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. De George, "14. Intellectual Property Rights," in The Oxford Handbook of Business Ethics, by George G. Brenkert and Tom L. Beauchamp, vol. 1, 1st ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, n.d.), 418.&lt;/ref&gt; Personality theorists argue that by being a creator of something one is inherently at risk and vulnerable for having their ideas and designs stolen and/or altered. Intellectual property protects these moral claims that have to do with personality.

[[Lysander Spooner]] (1855) argues "that a man has a natural and absolute right—and if a natural and absolute, then necessarily a perpetual, right—of property, in the ideas, of which he is the discoverer or creator; that his right of property, in ideas, is intrinsically the same as, and stands on identically the same grounds with, his right of property in material things; that no distinction, of principle, exists between the two cases".&lt;ref&gt;The Law of Intellectual Property, Part 1 Chapter 1 Section 9 – Lysander Spooner&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Ayn Rand]] argued in her book ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]'' that the protection of intellectual property is essentially a moral issue. The belief is that the human mind itself is the source of wealth and survival and that all property at its base is intellectual property. To violate intellectual property is therefore no different morally than violating other property rights which compromises the very processes of survival and therefore constitutes an immoral act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Rand |first=Ayn |authorlink=Ayn Rand |title=Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal |location=New York |publisher=Signet |year=1967 |origyear=1966 |edition=paperback 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infringement, misappropriation, and enforcement==
{{Main|Intellectual property infringement}}

Violation of intellectual property rights, called "infringement" with respect to patents, copyright, and trademarks, and "misappropriation" with respect to trade secrets, may be a breach of civil law or criminal law, depending on the type of intellectual property involved, jurisdiction, and the nature of the action.

As of 2011 trade in counterfeit copyrighted and trademarked works was a $600 billion industry worldwide and accounted for 5–7% of global trade.&lt;ref name=Bitton&gt;Miriam Bitton (2012) [http://www.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/backissues/v102/n1/1021_67.Bitton.pdf Rethinking the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement's Criminal Copyright Enforcement Measures] The Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology 102(1):67-117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patent infringement===
{{Main|Patent infringement|}}

Patent infringement typically is caused by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|69}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined in the [[claim (patent)|claims]] of the granted patent. There is [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] in many jurisdictions to use a patented invention for research. This safe harbor does not exist in the US unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes, or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug.&lt;ref&gt;Pradip K. Sahu and Shannon Mrksich, Ph.D. [http://www.brinkshofer.com/resource_center/85-the-hatch-waxman-act-research-exempt-from-patent-infringement The Hatch-Waxman Act: When Is Research Exempt from Patent Infringement?] ABA-IPL Newsletter 22(4) Summer 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In general, patent infringement cases are handled under civil law (e.g., in the United States) but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also (for example, Argentina, China, France, Japan, Russia, South Korea).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Cutler (2008) [http://blog.hdp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/60549706_1.PDF International Patent Litigation Survey: A Survey of the Characteristics of Patent Litigation in 17 International Jurisdictions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922062127/http://blog.hdp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/60549706_1.PDF |date=2013-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright infringement===
{{Main|Copyright infringement}}

Copyright infringement is reproducing, distributing, displaying or performing a [[Copyright law#Scope|work]], or to make [[derivative work]]s, without permission from the copyright holder, which is typically a publisher or other business representing or assigned by the work's creator. It is often called "piracy".&lt;ref name=Panethiere_p2&gt;{{cite web |last=Panethiere |first=Darrell |title=The Persistence of Piracy: The Consequences for Creativity, for Culture, and for Sustainable Development |publisher=UNESCO e-Copyright Bulletin |date=July–September 2005 |page=2 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/28696/11513329261panethiere_en.pdf/panethiere_en.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080816063513/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/28696/11513329261panethiere_en.pdf/panethiere_en.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While copyright is created the instant a work is fixed, generally the copyright holder can only get money damages if the owner registers the copyright.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Enforcement of copyright is generally the responsibility of the copyright holder.&lt;ref name=Xuan_p211&gt;{{cite book |last=Correa |first=Carlos Maria |author2=Li, Xuan |title=Intellectual property enforcement: international perspectives |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2009 |page=211 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bN3o1uwpKF4C&amp;dq=copyright+infringement+international+acta |isbn=978-1-84844-663-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|ACTA trade agreement]], signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the EU, and which has not entered into force, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to active police for infringement.&lt;ref name=Bitton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Musa&gt;Irina D.

Examples of such doctrines are the [[fair use]] and [[fair dealing]] doctrine.

===Trademark infringement===
{{Main|Trademark infringement}}

Trademark infringement occurs when one party uses a trademark that is identical or [[confusing similarity|confusingly similar]] to a trademark owned by another party, in relation to products or services which are identical or similar to the products or services of the other party. In many countries, a trademark receives protection without registration, but registering a trademark provides legal advantages for enforcement. Infringement can be addressed by civil litigation and, in several jurisdictions, under criminal law.&lt;ref name=Bitton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Musa /&gt;

===Trade secret misappropriation===
{{Main|Trade secret#Misappropriation}}

Trade secret misappropriation is different from violations of other intellectual property laws, since by definition trade secrets are secret, while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available. In the United States, trade secrets are protected under state law, and states have nearly universally adopted the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]]. The United States also has federal law in the form of the [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]] ({{usc|18|1831|1839}}), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, {{uscsub|18|1831|a}}, criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. The second, {{usc|18|1832}}, criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.) In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[common law]] jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] right rather than a [[property]] right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as in the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===The term "intellectual property"===
Criticism of the term ''intellectual property'' ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like ''property'' and ''rights'' in fashions that contradict practice and law. Many detractors think this term specially serves the doctrinal agenda of parties opposing reform in the public interest or otherwise abusing related legislations; and that it disallows intelligent discussion about specific and often unrelated aspects of copyright, patents, trademarks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Mike Masnick |authorlink1=Mike Masnick |title=If Intellectual Property Is Neither Intellectual, Nor Property, What Is It? |url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080306/003240458/if-intellectual-property-is-neither-intellectual-property-what-is-it.shtml |website=techdirt.com |publisher=[[Techdirt]] |accessdate=17 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813003301/https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080306/003240458/if-intellectual-property-is-neither-intellectual-property-what-is-it.shtml |archivedate=13 August 2014 |date=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Free Software Foundation]] founder [[Richard Stallman]] argues that, although the term ''intellectual property'' is in wide use, it should be rejected altogether, because it "systematically distorts and confuses these issues, and its use was and is promoted by those who gain from this confusion". He claims that the term "operates as a catch-all to lump together disparate laws [which] originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues" and that it creates a "bias" by confusing these monopolies with ownership of limited physical things, likening them to "property rights".&lt;ref name="mirage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml |title=Did You Say "Intellectual Property"? It's a Seductive Mirage |author=Richard M. Stallman |accessdate=2008-03-28 |publisher=Free Software Foundation, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman advocates referring to copyrights, patents and trademarks in the singular and warns against abstracting disparate laws into a collective term. He argues that "to avoid spreading unnecessary bias and confusion, it is best to adopt a firm policy not to speak or even think in terms of 'intellectual property'."&lt;ref name="words-to-avoid"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.en.html#IntellectualProperty |title=Words to Avoid (or Use with Care) Because They Are Loaded or Confusing |author=Richard M.

Similarly, economists [[Michele Boldrin|Boldrin]] and [[David K. Levine|Levine]] prefer to use the term "intellectual monopoly" as a more appropriate and clear definition of the concept, which they argue, is very dissimilar from property rights.&lt;ref&gt;Boldrin, Michele, and David K. Levine. [http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/general/intellectual/against.htm Against intellectual monopoly].

On the assumption that intellectual property rights are actual rights, Stallman says that this claim does not live to the historical intentions behind these laws, which in the case of copyright served as a censorship system, and later on, a regulatory model for the printing press that may have benefited authors incidentally, but never interfered with the freedom of average readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/forums/copyright.html |title=copyright and globalization in the age of computer networks |date=19 April 2001 |accessdate=21 October 2015 |website=mit.edu |publisher= |author=Richard Stallman |authorlink=Richard Stallman |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302072256/http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/forums/copyright.html |archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still referring to copyright, he cites legal literature such as the United States Constitution and [[case law]] to demonstrate that the law is meant to be an optional and experimental bargain to temporarily trade property rights and free speech for public, not private, benefits in the form of increased artistic production and knowledge. He mentions that "if copyright were a natural right nothing could justify terminating this right after a certain period of time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/misinterpreting-copyright.html |title=Misinterpreting Copyright |date= |accessdate=21 October 2015 |website=gnu.org |publisher= |author=Richard Stallman |authorlink=Richard Stallman |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905075652/https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/misinterpreting-copyright.html |archivedate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law professor, writer and political activist [[Lawrence Lessig]], along with many other [[copyleft]] and free software activists, has criticized the implied analogy with physical property (like land or an automobile). They argue such an analogy fails because physical property is generally rivalrous while intellectual works are non-rivalrous (that is, if one makes a copy of a work, the enjoyment of the copy does not prevent enjoyment of the original).&lt;ref name="lessigperpetual" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Intellectual property" is a silly euphemism |last=Doctorow |first=Cory |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/21/intellectual.property |date=2008-02-21 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other arguments along these lines claim that unlike the situation with tangible property, there is [[artificial scarcity|no natural scarcity]] of a particular idea or information: once it exists at all, it can be re-used and duplicated indefinitely without such re-use diminishing the original. [[Stephan Kinsella]] has objected to ''intellectual property'' on the grounds that the word "property" implies scarcity, which may not be applicable to ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Kinsella (2001) [https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/15_2/15_2_1.pdf Against Intellectual Property] Journal of Libertarian Studies 15(2):1–53&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative terms====
In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, intellectual property has often been referred to as [[intellectual rights]], traditionally a somewhat broader concept that has included [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] and other personal protections that cannot be bought or sold. Use of the term ''intellectual rights'' has declined since the early 1980s, as use of the term ''intellectual property'' has increased.

Alternative terms ''monopolies on information'' and ''intellectual monopoly'' have emerged among those who argue against the "property" or "intellect" or "rights" assumptions, notably [[Richard Stallman]]. The [[backronym]]s ''intellectual protectionism'' and ''intellectual poverty'',&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Kinsella for Ludwig von Mises Institute blog, January 6, 2011. [http://archive.mises.org/15240/intellectual-poverty/ Intellectual Poverty]&lt;/ref&gt; whose initials are also ''IP'', have found supporters as well, especially among those who have used the backronym ''[[Opposition to digital rights management|digital restrictions management]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drm.info/ Official drm.info site] run by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management |title=What is DRM? |publisher=Defective by Design |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that an intellectual property right should (in the interests of better balancing of relevant private and public interests) be termed an ''intellectual monopoly privilege'' (IMP) has been advanced by several academics including Birgitte Andersen&lt;ref&gt;Birgitte Andersen.

Petra Moser has asserted that historical analysis suggests that intellectual property laws may harm innovation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Overall, the weight of the existing historical evidence suggests that patent policies, which grant strong intellectual property rights to early generations of inventors, may discourage innovation. On the contrary, policies that encourage the diffusion of ideas and modify patent laws to facilitate entry and encourage competition may be an effective mechanism to encourage innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Moser, Petra. 2013. "Patents and Innovation: Evidence from Economic History." Journal of Economic Perspectives, 27(1): 23-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In support of that argument, [[Jörg Baten]], Nicola Bianchi and Petra Moser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baten|first1=Jörg|last2=Bianchi|first2=Nicola|last3=Moser|first3=Petra|title=Compulsory licensing and innovation–Historical evidence from German patents after WWI|journal=Journal of Development Economics|date=2017|volume=126|pages=231–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; find historical evidence that especially compulsory licensing – which allows governments to license patents without the consent of patent-owners – encouraged invention in Germany in the early 20th century by increasing the threat of competition in fields with low pre-existing levels of competition.

[[Peter Drahos]] notes, "Property rights confer authority over resources. When authority is granted to the few over resources on which many depend, the few gain power over the goals of the many. This has consequences for both political and economic freedoms with in a society."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Drahos and John Braithwaite.

The [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) recognizes that conflicts may exist between the respect for and implementation of current intellectual property systems and other human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WIPO – World Intellectual Property Organization |title=Human Rights and Intellectual Property: An Overview |url=http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022125749/http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/hr/ |archivedate=October 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the UN [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] issued a document called "Human rights and intellectual property" that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product; in order to serve human well-being, intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws.

Further along these lines, The ethical problems brought up by IP rights are most pertinent when it is socially valuable goods like life-saving medicines are given IP protection. While the application of IP rights can allow companies to charge higher than the marginal cost of production in order to recoup the costs of research and development, the price may exclude from the market anyone who cannot afford the cost of the product, in this case a life-saving drug.&lt;ref name=Sonderholm&gt;Jorn Sonderholm (2010) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-9991.2010.00358.x/abstract Ethical Issues Surrounding Intellectual Property Rights], Philosophy Compass 5(12): 1107–1115.&lt;/ref&gt; "An IPR driven regime is therefore not a regime that is conductive to the investment of R&amp;D of products that are socially valuable to predominately poor populations".&lt;ref name=Sonderholm /&gt;{{rp|1108–9}}

[[Libertarian]]s have [[Libertarian perspectives on intellectual property|differing views on intellectual property]].{{Fact|date=August 2018}} [[Stephan Kinsella]], an [[anarcho-capitalist]] on the [[right-libertarian|right-wing of libertarianism]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Kinsella, [http://web.archive.org/web/20180415041048/https://www.lewrockwell.com/2004/01/stephan-kinsella/what-it-means-to-be-an-anarcho-capitalist/ "What It Means To Be an Anarcho-Capitalist"], "LewRockwell.com", published 2004-01-20, archived 2018-04-15, accessed 2018-08-04&lt;/ref&gt; [[criticism of intellectual property|argues against intellectual property]] because allowing property rights in ideas and information creates [[artificial scarcity]] and infringes on the right to own tangible property. Kinsella uses the following scenario to argue this point:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]magine the time when men lived in caves. One bright guy&amp;mdash;let's call him Galt-Magnon&amp;mdash;decides to build a log cabin on an open field, near his crops. To be sure, this is a good idea, and others notice it. They naturally imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But the first man to invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea. Clearly, this rule flies in the face of the first-user homesteading rule, arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/books/against.pdf N. Stephan Kinsella, ''Against Intellectual property''] (2008), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Thomas Jefferson]] once said in a letter to Isaac McPherson on August 13, 1813:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his [[candle|taper]] at mine, receives light without darkening me."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html Thomas Jefferson, ''Letter to Isaac McPherson''] (August 13, 1813)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another aspect of current U.S. Intellectual Property legislation is its focus on individual and joint works; thus, copyright protection can only be obtained in 'original' works of authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Philip |last=Bennet|title=Native Americans and Intellectual Property: the Necessity of Implementing Collective Ideals into Current United States Intellectual Property Laws|year= 2009 |ssrn=1498783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion in nature and scope of intellectual property laws===
[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|Expansion of U.S. copyright law (Assuming authors create their works by age 35 and live for seventy years)]]

Other criticism of intellectual property law concerns the expansion of intellectual property, both in duration and in scope.

In addition, as scientific knowledge has expanded and allowed new industries to arise in fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, originators of technology have sought IP protection for the new technologies. Patents have been granted for living organisms,&lt;ref&gt;Council for Responsible Genetics, [http://www.actionbioscience.org/genomics/crg.html DNA Patents Create Monopolies on Living Organisms.] Accessed 2008.12.18.&lt;/ref&gt; (and in the United States, [[Plant breeders' rights|certain living organisms]] have been patentable for over a century).&lt;ref&gt;Plant Patents [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/plant/ USPTO.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in terms of protection is particularly seen in relation to copyright, which has recently been the subject of serial extensions [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act|in the United States]] and [[Directive on harmonising the term of copyright protection|in Europe]].&lt;ref name="lessigperpetual"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.lessig.org/index.php/Against_perpetual_copyright |title=Against perpetual copyright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', the U.S. [[Copyright Term Extension Act]], Pub.L. 105–298.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Helprin, Op-ed: [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/opinion/20helprin.html A Great Idea Lives Forever.

Also with respect to copyright, the American film industry helped to change the social construct of intellectual property via its trade organization, the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]. In amicus briefs in important cases, in lobbying before Congress, and in its statements to the public, the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual-property rights. In framing its presentations, the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor. Additionally Congress's awareness of the position of the United States as the world's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Wharton, "MPAA's Rebel With Cause Fights for Copyright Coin," Variety (August 3, 1992), Vol. 348, No. 2, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; These doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry, lending the MPAA even more power and authority.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Fisher III, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property99/history.html The Growth of Intellectual Property:A History of the Ownership of Ideas in the United States] Eigentumskulturen im Vergleich (Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hilllary Rosen testifies on Napster.jpg|thumb|right|RIAA representative [[Hilary Rosen]] testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the future of digital music (July 11, 2000)]]
The growth of the [[Internet]], and particularly distributed search engines like [[Kazaa]] and [[Gnutella]], have represented a challenge for copyright policy. The [[Recording Industry Association of America]], in particular, has been on the front lines of the fight against [[copyright infringement]], which the industry calls "piracy". The industry has had victories against some services, including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company [[Napster]], and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright. The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based [[digital rights management]] tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works. Laws such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] have been enacted that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the [[EU Copyright Directive|Copyright Directive]]. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the [[Conditional Access Directive]] of 1998 (98/84/EEC). This can hinder legal uses, affecting [[public domain]] works, [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]], or uses allowed by the copyright holder. Some [[copyleft]] licenses, like [[GNU GPL 3]], are designed to counter that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html |title=A Quick Guide to GPLv3 |author=Brett Smith |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=2007–2010 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws may permit circumvention under specific conditions like when it is necessary to achieve interoperability with the circumventor's program, or for [[accessibility]] reasons; however, distribution of circumvention tools or instructions may be illegal.

In the context of trademarks, this expansion has been driven by international efforts to harmonise the definition of "trademark", as exemplified by the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] ratified in 1994, which formalized regulations for IP rights that had been handled by common law, or not at all, in member states. Pursuant to TRIPs, any [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] which is "capable of distinguishing" the products or services of one business from the products or services of another business is capable of constituting a trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Beckman and Christa Pletcher (2009) [http://ipjournal.law.wfu.edu/files/2010/10/article.10.215.pdf Expanding Global Trademark Regulation] Wake Forest Intellectual Property Law Journal 10(2): 215–239&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017-2018, both the U.S. and the EU Commission simultaneously decided to depart from the [[Base erosion and profit shifting (OECD project)|OECD BEPS Project]] timetable, which was set up in 2013 to combat IP BEPS tax tools like the above,&lt;ref name="BEPS Background"&gt;{{cite web|title=BEPS Project Background Brief|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/background-brief-inclusive-framework-for-beps-implementation.pdf|publisher=OECD|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launch their own anti-IP BEPS tax regimes:

The departure of the U.S. and EU Commission from the OECD BEPS Project process, is attributed to frustrations with the rise in IP as a key BEPS tax tool, creating intangible assets, which are then turned into royalty payment BEPS schemes (double Irish), and/or [[capital allowance]] BEPS schemes (capital allowances for intangibles).  In contrast, the OECD has spent years developing and advocating intellectual property as a legal and a GAAP accounting concept.&lt;ref name="un1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2017/09/11/new-un-tax-handbook-sets-lower-income-countries-oecd-beps/|title=New UN tax handbook: Lower-income countries vs OECD BEPS failure|publisher=Tax Justice Network| date=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU Commission's [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|€13 billion fine]] of Apple's pre 2015 double Irish IP BEPS tax scheme, is the largest corporate tax fine in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4472500/apple-eu-irish-tax-bill/|title=Apple vs. the E.U.

'''Khanty''' (or Hanti), previously known as '''Ostyak''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|s|t|i|æ|k}}),&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; is the language of the [[Khanty|Khanty people]]. It is spoken in [[Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug|Khanty–Mansi]] and [[Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug|Yamalo-Nenets]] [[autonomous okrug]]s as well as in [[Alexandrovsky District, Tomsk Oblast|Aleksandrovsky]] and [[Kargosoksky District, Tomsk Oblast|Kargosoksky]] districts of [[Tomsk Oblast]] in [[Russia]]. According to the 1994 Salminen and Janhunen study, there were 12,000 Khanty-speaking people in Russia.

The Khanty language has a large number of [[dialect]]s. The western group includes the [[Salekhard|Obdoria]]n, [[Ob River|Ob]], and [[Irtysh]] dialects. The eastern group includes the [[Surgut]] and [[Vakh River|Vakh]]-[[Vasyugan River|Vasyugan]] dialects, which, in turn, are subdivided into thirteen other dialects. All these dialects differ significantly from each other by [[Phonetics|phonetic]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], and [[Vocabulary|lexical]] features to the extent that the three main "dialects" (northern, southern and eastern) are mutually unintelligible.{{sfn|Gulya|1966|pp=5-6}} Thus, based on their significant multifactorial differences, Eastern, Northern and Southern Khanty could be considered separate but closely related languages.

==Literary language==
[[File:Map of Russia - Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug (2008-03).svg|thumb|300px|The Khanty language is spoken primarily in the [[Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug]] in western [[Siberia]]]]
The Khanty [[written language]] was first created after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|October Revolution]] on the basis of the [[Latin script]] in 1930 and then with the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]] (with the additional letter {{angle bracket|ң}} for {{IPA|/ŋ/}}) from 1937.

Khanty [[literary]] works are usually written in three Northern dialects, [[Kazym]], [[Shuryshkar]], and Middle Ob. Newspaper reporting and broadcasting are usually done in the Kazymian dialect.

==Varieties==
[[File:Khanty Mansi dialects.svg|thumbnail|300px|Dialects of Khanty (and [[Mansi language|Mansi]]):
{{legend|Yellow|Obdorsk (Salekhard) dialect}}

{{legend|Turquoise|Surgut dialects}}
{{legend|LimeGreen|Far Eastern (Vakh-Vasyugan) dialects}}]]
Khanty is divided in three main dialect groups, which are to a large degree [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually unintelligible]], and therefore best considered three languages: Northern, Southern and Eastern. Individual dialects are named after the rivers they are or were spoken on. Southern Khanty is probably extinct by now.{{sfn|Abondolo|1998|pp=358-359}}{{sfn|Honti|1998|pp=328-329}}
*'''Eastern Khanty'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=László|last=Honti|year=1981|title=Ostjakin kielen itämurteiden luokittelu|work=Congressus Quintus Internationalis Fenno-Ugristarum, Turku 20.-27. VIII. 1980|pp=95-100|publisher=Suomen kielen seura|location=Turku}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Far Eastern ([[Vakh River|Vakh]], [[Vasyugan River|Vasjugan]], Verkhne-Kalimsk, Vartovskoe)
**[[Surgutsky District|Surgut]] (Jugan, Malij Jugan, [[Pim River|Pim]], Likrisovskoe, [[Tromyogan River|Tremjugan]], Tromagan)
*transitional: [[Salym River|Salym]]
*Western Khanty
**'''Northern Khanty'''
*** [[Obdorsk]]
*** [[Beryozovsky District, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug|Berjozov]] (Synja, Muzhi, Shurishkar), [[Kazim River|Kazym]], Sherkal
*** transitional: Atlym, Nizyam
**'''Southern Khanty''': Upper Demjanka, Lower Demjanka, [[Konda River|Konda]], Cingali, Krasnojarsk
The Salym dialect can be classified as transitional between Eastern and Southern (Honti:1998 suggests closer affinity with Eastern, Abondolo:1998 in the same work with Southern). The Atlym and Nizyam dialects also show some Southern features.

Southern and Northern Khanty share various innovations and can be grouped together as Western Khanty. These include loss of full front rounded vowels: *üü, *öö, *ɔ̈ɔ̈ &gt; *ii, *ee, *ää (but *ɔ̈ɔ̈ &gt; *oo adjacent to *k, *ŋ),{{sfn|Honti|1998|p=336}} loss of vowel harmony, fricativization of *k to /x/ adjacent to back vowels,{{sfn|Abondolo|1998|pp=358–359}} and the loss of the *ɣ phoneme.{{sfn|Honti|1998|p=338}}

==Phonology==
A general feature of all Khanty varieties is that while [[vowel length|long vowels]] are not distinguished, a contrast between plain vowels (e.g. {{IPA|/o/}}) vs. reduced or extra-short vowels (e.g. {{IPA|/ŏ/}}) is found. This corresponds to an actual length distinction in Khanty's close relative [[Mansi language|Mansi]]. According to scholars who posit a common [[Ob-Ugric languages|Ob-Ugric]] ancestry for the two, this was also the original Proto-Ob-Ugric situation.

[[Palatalization (phonetics)|Palatalization]] of consonants is phonemic in Khanty, as in most other Uralic languages. [[Retroflex consonant]]s are also found in most varieties of Khanty.

Khanty word stress is usually on the initial syllable.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Estill, ''Diachronic Change in Erzya Word Stress'' (Finno-Ugrian Society, 2004; {{ISBN|9525150801}}), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

19 consonants are reconstructed for Proto-Khanty, listed with the traditional [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet|UPA]] transcription shown above and an [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription shown below.

A major consonant isogloss among the Khanty varieties is the reflexation of the lateral consonants, *ɬ (from Proto-Uralic *s and *š) and *l (from Proto-Uralic *l and *ð).{{sfn|Honti|1998|p=338}} These generally merge, however with varying results: /l/ in the Obdorsk and Far Eastern dialects, /ɬ/ in the Kazym and Surgut dialects, and /t/ elsewhere. The Vasjugan dialect still retains the distinction word-initially, having instead shifted *ɬ &gt; /j/ in this position. Similarly, the palatalized lateral *ľ developed to /lʲ/ in Far Eastern and Obdorsk, /ɬʲ/ in Kazym and Surgut, and /tʲ/ elsewhere. The retroflex lateral *ḷ remains in Far Eastern, but in /t/-dialects develops into a new plain /l/.

Other dialect isoglosses include the development of original *ć to a palatalized stop /tʲ/ in Eastern and Southern Khanty, but to a palatalized sibilant /sʲ ~ ɕ/ in Northern, and the development of original *č similarly to a sibilant /ʂ/ (= UPA: {{UPA|š}}) in Northern Khanty, partly also in Southern Khanty.

===Eastern Khanty===

====Far Eastern====
The Vakh dialect is divergent. It has rigid [[vowel harmony]] and a [[tripartite language|tripartite]] (ergative–accusative) case system: The subject of a [[transitive verb]] takes the instrumental case suffix ''-nə-'', while the object takes the accusative case suffix. The subject of an [[intransitive verb]], however, is not marked for case and might be said to be ''absolutive''. The transitive verb agrees with the subject, as in [[nominative–accusative]] systems.

Vakh has the richest vowel inventory, with four reduced vowels {{IPA|/ĕ ø̆ ɑ̆ ŏ/}} and full {{IPA|/i y ɯ u e ø o æ ɑ/}}. Some researchers also report {{IPA|/œ ɔ/}}.{{sfn|Abondolo|1998|p=360}}

Notes:
# /tʲ/ can be realized as an affricate [tɕ] in the Tremjugan and Agan sub-dialects.
# The velar/uvular contrast is predictable in inherited vocabulary: [q] appears before back vowels, [k] before front and central vowels. However, in loanwords from Russian, [k] may also be found before back vowels.
# The phonemic status of [ʃ] is not clear. It occurs in some words in variation with [s], in others in variation with [tʃ].
# In the Pim sub-dialect, /ɬ/ has recently shifted to /t/, a change that has spread from Southern Khanty.
# The labialized postvelar approximant [ʁ̞ʷ] occurs in the Tremjugan sub-dialect as an allophone of /w/ between back vowels, for some speakers also word-initially before back vowels. Research from the early 20th century also reported two other labialized phonemes: /kʷ~qʷ/ and /ŋʷ/, but these are no longer distinguished.

===Northern Khanty===
The Kazym dialect distinguishes 18 consonants.

The vowel inventory is much simplified. Eight vowels are distinguished in initial syllables: four full {{IPA|/e a ɒ o/}} and four reduced {{IPA|/ĭ ă ŏ ŭ/}}. In unstressed syllables, four values are found: {{IPA|/ɑ ə ĕ ĭ/}}.{{sfn|Honti|1998|p=337}}

A similarly simple vowel inventory is found in the Nizyam, Sherkal, and Berjozov dialects, which have full {{IPA|/e a ɒ u/}} and reduced {{IPA|/ĭ ɑ̆ ŏ ŭ/}}. Aside from the full vs. reduced contrast rather than one of length, this is identical to that of the adjacent [[Sosva dialect]] of [[Mansi language|Mansi]].{{sfn|Abondolo|1998|p=360}}

The Obdorsk dialect has retained full close vowels and has a nine-vowel system: full vowels {{IPA|/i e æ ɑ o u/}} and reduced vowels {{IPA|/æ̆ ɑ̆ ŏ/}}).{{sfn|Abondolo|1998|p=360}} It however has a simpler consonant inventory, having the lateral approximants /l lʲ/ in place of the fricatives /ɬ ɬʲ/ and having fronted {{UPA|*š}} {{UPA|*ṇ}} to /s n/.

==Grammar==
{{Citations missing|section|date=April 2018}}

===The noun===
The nominal suffixes include [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] ''{{IPA|-ŋən}}'', [[plural]] ''{{IPA|-(ə)t}}'', [[dative case|dative]] ''{{IPA|-a}}'', [[locative case|locative]]/[[instrumental case|instrumental]] ''{{IPA|-nə}}''.

For example:
:''xot'' "house" (cf.  [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''koti'' "home")
:''xotŋəna'' "to the two houses"
:''xotətnə'' "at the houses" (cf. [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''otth'''on''''', Finnish ''koto'''na''''' "at home", an exceptional form using the old, locative meaning of the essive case ending -na).

Singular, dual, and plural possessive suffixes may be added to singular, dual, and plural nouns, in three persons, for 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 27 forms. A few, from ''məs'' "cow", are:
:''məsem'' "my cow"
:''məsemən'' "my 2 cows"
:''məsew'' "my cows"
:''məstatən'' "the 2 of our cows"
:''məsŋətuw'' "our 2 cows"

===Pronouns===
The personal pronouns are, in the nominative case:
{|
| || SG || DU || PL
|-
| 1st person || ''ma'' || ''min'' || ''muŋ''
|-
| 2nd person || ''naŋ'' || ''nən'' || ''naŋ''
|-
| 3rd person || ''tuw'' || ''tən'' || ''təw''
|}

The cases of ''ma'' are accusative ''manət'' and dative ''manəm''.

The demonstrative pronouns and adjectives are:
:''tamə'' "this", ''tomə'' "that", ''sit'' "that yonder": ''tam xot'' "this house".

Basic interrogative pronouns are:
:''xoy'' "who?", ''muy'' "what?"

The formation of multiples of ten shows Slavic influence in Khanty, whereas Hungarian uses the collective derivative suffix ''-van (-ven)'' closely related to the suffix of the [[adverbial participle]] which is ''-va (-ve)'' today but used to be ''-ván (-vén)''. Note also the regularity of {{IPA|[xot]-[haːz]}} "house" and {{IPA|[sot]-[saːz]}} "hundred".

==Syntax==
Both Khanty and [[Mansi language|Mansi]] are basically [[nominative–accusative language]]s but have innovative morphological ergativity. In an ergative construction, the object is given the same case as the subject of an '''intransitive''' verb, and the [[Locative case|locative]] is used for the agent of the transitive verb (as an [[Instrumental case|instrumental]]) . This may be used with some specific verbs, for example "to give": the literal Anglicisation would be "by me (subject) a fish (object) gave to you (indirect object)" for the equivalent of the sentence "I gave a fish to you". However, the ergative is a morphological (marked using a case) only, not syntactic, so that, in addition, these may be passivized in a way resembling English. For example, in [[Mansi language|Mansi]], "a dog (agent) bit you (object)" could be reformatted as "you (object) were bitten, by a dog (instrument)".

Khanty is an agglutinative language and employs an [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qaSdffgD9t4C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=Komi+word+order&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uH3Jv3XzcU&amp;sig=kBI-1a4U27h0srXd5DxdAfT6jVQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PBsMT-HrOoforQf8xOG0BA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Komi%20word%20order&amp;f=false |title=Language Policy in the Soviet Union |first=Lenore A |last=Grenoble |publisher=Springer |year=2003 |isbn=9781402012983 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10400">'''Korean birthday celebrations''' or '''Dol''' are one of the important facets of [[Culture of Korea|Korean culture]]. When a person reaches an important age in his or her life, Koreans have unique celebrations to mark these milestones. Dol has two meanings in Korean. The most common meaning is a child's first birthday or [[Doljanchi]]. It can also be used as a generic description for birthdays: Cheot-dol (first birthday), Du-dol (second birthday), Seo-dol (third birthday), etc.

== ''Dol'' (돌)==
[[File:Dol.jpg|thumb|Dol ceremony]]
{{main|Doljanchi}}
''Dol'' (''doljanchi'', or ''tol'') is probably one of the best-known of the Korean birthday celebrations. ''Dol'' is celebrated for the first birthday of a child. When Korea had little medicinal knowledge, many newborns would die from [[List of childhood diseases and disorders|childhood diseases]] or because of Korea’s seasonal temperature differences. When a child lived to be a year old during that period, it was a very joyous occasion. &lt;ref&gt;Child's first birthday (tol). Retrieved 10/05, 2008, from http://www.lifeinkorea.com/culture/tol/tol.cfm#baekil&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the ''dol'' celebration is prayer. Traditionally, Koreans would pray to two of the many Korean gods: ''Sanshin'' (the mountain god) and ''Samshin'' (the birth goddess). Koreans would prepare the praying table with specific foods: a bowl of steamed [[white rice]], seaweed soup (miyeok-guk) and a bowl of pure water. Layered [[Azuki bean|red bean]] [[rice cake]]s (''samshin siru'') were placed next to the prayer table. The rice cakes were not shared outside the family; it was believed that sharing this particular item with people outside the family would bring [[Luck|bad luck]] to the child. After everything on the praying table was ready the mother (or grandmother) of the child would pray to ''Sanshin'' and ''Samshin'', placing her hands together and rubbing her palms. She would ask for her child's longevity, wish luck to the mountain god, and give thanks to the birth goddess. After she finished her prayer, she bowed to Samshin several times. Women were the only ones allowed to participate in this ceremony; men were forbidden to be part of the praying. When the praying ceremony commenced depended on the region. People from [[Seoul]] would pray in the early morning of the child's birthday; other regions prayed the night before. Today this part of the celebrations is usually skipped, because [[Korean shamanism|Muism]] (the religion that worshiped the Korean gods) is rarely practiced. &lt;ref&gt;Child's first birthday (tol). Retrieved 10/05, 2008, from http://www.lifeinkorea.com/culture/tol/tol.cfm#baekil&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the main part of the celebration, the baby is dressed in very colorful, ornate clothing called ''dol-bok''.  The ''dol-bok'' that the child wears differs according to the child’s sex.  A boy would traditionally wear a pink or striped ''jogori'' (jacket) with purple or gray ''paji'' (pants), a striped ''durumagi'' (long jacket), a blue vest printed with a gold or silver pattern or a striped ''magoja'' (jacket), a ''jonbok'' (long blue vest) with a gold or silver pattern, a ''bokgun'' (black hat with long tail), and ''tarae-busun'' (traditional socks). A girl would wear a striped ''jogori'', a long red ''chima'' (skirt), a gold-and-silver printed ''jobawi'' (hat) and ''tarae-busun''. In addition to their ''dol-bok'', boys and girls would wear a long ''dol-ddi'' (belt that wraps around the body twice) for longevity and a ''dol-jumuni'' (pouch) for luck. The ''dol-jumuni'' would be made of fine silk, with a thread to open and close it. Buttons were not used in the ''dol-bok'', to symbolize longevity. &lt;ref&gt;Child's first birthday (tol). Retrieved 10/05, 2008, from http://www.lifeinkorea.com/culture/tol/tol.cfm#baekil&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The ''Toljabee'' is the main celebration of ''Tol''. A large table is prepared with over a dozen different types of rice cakes or ''ddeok'' (the main food). Some types of ''ddeok'' are ''paekseolgi'' (white steamed rice cakes), ''susu-kyongdan'' (rice cakes coated with rough red bean powder), ''mujigae-ddeok'' (rainbow-colored steamed rice cakes) and ''gyep'i-ddeok'' (puffed-air rice cakes). Along with the ''deeok'', fruit is also served; the fruit on the table varies, depending on the season. There is also a bowl of rice and various other foods placed on the table. Food is not the only thing on the table, however; there is also a large spool of thread, a brush, a [[Korean calligraphy]] set, a pencil, a book, money (10,000-''won'' bills) and a [[Bow (weapon)|bow and arrow]] (or a needle, ruler and pair of scissors for girls). After the table is set, the parents sit the baby on a traditional Korean mattress (''bolou'') and Korean cushions (''bangsuk''). This is done so that relatives can get better pictures of the infant.  There is also a traditional screen in the background. The ''toljiabee'' then begins. The baby picks up various items on the table that attracts him or her. The items that the child picks up are said to predict the child’s future. If the child picks up the thread, the child will have a long life. A child who picks up the pencil, book or calligraphy set is forecast to be a good scholar. A child who picks the rice, rice cakes, or money will become rich; some say that choosing the rice (or a rice cake) means the child is unintelligent, or that they will never be hungry. If the ruler, pair of scissors or needle is chosen, it is said that the child will be dexterous. If the child chooses the knife, they will become a good chef. In the modern era, people often prepare modern objects such as sports equipment, a [[microphone]], a [[stethoscope]] or a computer mouse, to symbolize modern talents. &lt;ref&gt;Child's first birthday (tol). Retrieved 10/05, 2008, from http://www.lifeinkorea.com/culture/tol/tol.cfm#baekil&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Saei-rye'' (세이레)==

The baby's well-being is celebrated 21 days after the birth with a meal of white rice, [[Miyeok guk]] (Miyeok seaweed soup), and [[Baekseolgi]] (white rice cake [[tteok]]). The Baekseolgi symbolizes sacredness. By this time, the baby and mother are still recovering from birth, so people were not allowed to see them. However, close family members are met and prayed for the healthy recovery of the baby's mother on this day.&lt;ref&gt;Festive Occasions: The Customs in Korea by Yoon Seo-seok&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Baek-il'' (백일)==

Another birthday celebration is ''Baek-il'' (100th-day celebration). During this celebration, the family worships ''Samshin''. They make her offerings of rice and soup for having cared for the infant and the mother, and for having helped them live through a difficult period. They give thanks to ''Samshin'' and also pray for ''jae-ak'' (wealth), longevity, and ''cho-bok'' (traditional word for "luck").&lt;ref&gt;Child's first birthday (tol). Retrieved 10/05, 2008, from http://www.lifeinkorea.com/culture/tol/tol.cfm#baekil&lt;/ref&gt; After the prayer the family, relatives and friends celebrate with rice cakes, wine, and other delicacies such as red and black bean cakes sweetened with sugar or honey. In order to protect the child, red bean rice cakes are placed at the four compass points of the house. This not only brought protection, but was also believed to bring good fortune and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Embassy. (2000). Birthday celebrations. Retrieved 10/5, 2008, from
http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/cel/birthday_celebrations.htm
&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely believed that if 100 people share the rice cakes the child will live a long life, so the family would also send rice cakes to neighbors and others. Those who receive rice cakes return the dishes with lengths of thread (expressing the hope for longevity), rice and money (symbolizing future wealth).&lt;ref&gt;"Birthday Traditions from Around the World" . Retrieved 10/12, 2008, from &lt;http://www.coolest-kid-birthday-parties.com/birthday-traditions.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Hwangap'' (환갑)==

When a person turns 60, there was a celebration known as ''hwangap''.  This was considered an auspicious year, since when someone turned 60 the [[sexagenary cycle]] of the [[Korean calendar|Korean zodiac]] is complete. Each person is born under one of the twelve zodiac animals. It takes 60 years for the zodiac animal and the element under which one is born to align.&lt;ref&gt;"Chinese Zodiac." . Retrieved 10/12, 2008, from &lt;http://www.peprimer.com/chinzo.html#SECTION1&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt; Another reason that ''hwangap'' is so important is that many years ago (before the advent of [[Medicine|modern medicine]]), it was uncommon for a person to live 60 years. There is a celebration; children honor their parents with a feast and merrymaking. Part of the celebration involves the children of the birthday celebrant; starting with the eldest, they bow and offer wine to their parents. After the children give their respects to their parents, their children show respect to them; again starting with the eldest, in the same way. While these rituals are being carried out, [[Folk music|traditional music]] is played and professional entertainers sing songs, encouraging people to drink. In order to make the recipient of the ''hwangap'' feel young, adults and teens dress in children’s clothing. They also sing children's songs and dance children's dances.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Embassy. (2000). Birthday celebrations. Retrieved 10/5, 2008, from
http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/cel/birthday_celebrations.htm
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coming-of-age rites ==

A less well-known birthday celebration is when a boy or girl reaches their adult age (20 for the boy and 15 for the girl). When a boy turned into an adult he would tie his hair into a top knot and be given a [[Gat (hat)|Gat]] (traditional cylindrical Korean hat made of [[horsehair]]). He would be required to lift a heavy rock as a test of his strength. If he can lift and move the rock, he is considered a man. A girl would become an adult by rolling her braided hair into a chignon bun and fixing it with a [[Binyeo]], a long ornamental hairpin .&lt;ref&gt;Korean Overseas Information Service, Haeoe Kongbogwa (Ed. 1).

'''''L'art de toucher le clavecin''''' (English: ''The Art of Playing the [[Harpsichord]]'') is a [[didactic]] treatise by the [[French people|French]] [[composer]] [[François Couperin]]. It was first published in 1716, and was followed by a revised edition in 1717.

The treatise was written to instruct keyboard players in performance practice, particularly for Couperin's ''Pièces de Clavecin''; Couperin, upon its publication, noted that it was "absolutely indispensable for playing my ''Pièces'' in the style most suitable to them".&lt;ref name="foreword1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Couperin|first=Francois|title=L'art de toucher le Clavecin|year=1974|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing|isbn=0-7390-0760-2|pages=3–5|editor=Margery Halford|chapter=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
With the [[early music revival]], it became one of the primary sources for the keyboard [[Fingering (music)|fingering]] system which prevailed in Europe during the Baroque era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of the Harpsichord|author=de Saint-Lambert, Michel|page=73|year=1983|isbn=978-0-521-27269-8|publisher=CUP Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also sheds light on the [[Ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]] used at the time.
It is considered one of the most significant surviving treatises of the period.&lt;ref name="foreword1"/&gt;

==Publication history and contents==
There are no known autograph copies of the treatise, but copies survive of the two versions published during Couperin's lifetime
The 1716 edition of the work included eight simple Preludes and an original [[Allemande]], technique exercises and instructions, fingering notes for passages in ''Pièces de Clavecin'', and an essay about ornamentation. The 1717 edition added a new preface and a supplement outlining fingering for the second book of ''Pièces de Clavecin''.&lt;ref name="foreword1"/&gt;

''L'art de toucher le clavecin'' was one of the last books to include [[unmeasured prelude]]s, along with [[Nicolas Siret]]'s second volume of harpsichord pieces (''Second livre de pièces de clavecin'', published in 1719).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9453">'''The first hybridisation of [[Canna (plant)|Cannas]]''' was performed in 1848, and since then many Canna hybridizers have made their contribution to the genus over the centuries. This is a date ordered list of those people and their brief stories.

==1848 Théodore Année==
A retired French diplomatic agent in America, the gentleman gardener Monsieur [[Théodore Année]] of [[Passy]], France brought back from his travels the seeds of several [[Canna (plant)|Canna]] [[species]], and in 1848 he crossed C. ''glauca'' with C. ''indica'', so producing the first known and recorded Canna hybrid, C. x ''annaei'' [[Édouard André|André]], now referred to as C. 'Annei'. Année was rapidly joined by many other enthusiasts and professional horticulturists as Canna hybrids enjoyed rapid popularity in France. In 1866 he retired to [[Nice]], France and from there released his last recorded cultivar, C. 'Prémices de Nice'.

==1850s Jean Liabaud==
A resident of [[Lyon]], France.

==1850s E. Chaté et fils==
A resident of [[Paris]], France.

==1860s Jean Sisley==
A resident of Lyon, France.

==1860s Mr Goujon and Mr Jules Chretien==
Resident of Lyon, France. Both supervisors of the [[Tete d’Or]] park.

==1862 Antoine Crozy==
[[File:Canna MadameCrozy 01.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''Canna'' (Crozy Group) 'Madame Crozy' (Crozy)]]
Amongst the professionals who joined in the enthusiasm for new Canna cultivars was the rose breeder Monsieur [[Pierre Antoine Marie Crozy|Antoine Crozy]] of Lyons, France, who first started hybridising Cannas in 1862 and continued introducing new canna cultivars at a rapid rate until his death in 1903, giving his name to a whole new group of floriferous Canna cultivars. Crozy aîné (French for "elder"), as he was universally known, was succeeded by his son, Michel Crozy (1871–1908). He was also accorded the nickname of ''Papa Canna'', as he was considered to be the father of Cannas. Unfortunately, no images of this remarkable man appear to have survived over the years.

==1870s Monsieur Nardy==
Resident of Lyons, France.

==1880s Wilhelm Pfitzer==
Messrs [[Wilhelm Pfitzer]] of [[Fellbach|Stadt Fellbach]] in [[Germany]] produced over 300 new cultivars up until the early 1950s. Many generations of the founder, Wilhelm, followed in the business, which is still in existence on a small scale. Wilhelm's son Walter took over control of the business in the 1870s until his death in 1931. Until then, Walter Pfitzer was still in demand judging at international fairs, exhibitions, and shows, retaining his Presidency and Vice Presidency of the German and British Gladiolus Societies respectively, right until the end. His continual interest in Cannas meant a steady supply of new cultivars being produced each year.

In 1933, there were about 150 employees worldwide. That same year, in order to celebrate the elevation of Fellbach to the status of a city, the firm named one of its best seedlings that year as Canna ‘Stadt Fellbach’, meaning ‘City of Fellbach’. That is still a popular cultivar in this day and age.

Walter's children Paul, Anna &amp; Rudolf followed their father into the business, but in the 1950s they were forced to abandon the breeding of Cannas, as the high cost of German labour meant that they could no longer compete with Mediterranean countries, who also enjoyed a more favourable climate.

==1880 Vilmorin-Andrieux &amp; Cie==
Messrs [[Louis de Vilmorin|Vilmorin-Andrieux &amp; Cie]] in France produced a considerable number of new cultivars during the last century.

==1890s Antoine Wintzer==
Although thought of primarily as [[rose]] hybridists, the US firm of [[Conard Pyle Co.]] also contributed large numbers of cultivars in the early part of the 1900s, under the guidance of its chief hybridist [[Antoine Wintzer]]. Wintzer worked in collaboration with Dr van Fleet, of the USDA, to produce many new Canna varieties.

==1887 Dammann &amp; Cie==
[[File:Canna Austria 004.JPG|thumb|right|''Canna'' (Italian Group) 'Austria' (Dammann)]]
One of Crozy's most beautiful creations was the cultivar [[Canna 'Madame Crozy']], that has a beautiful crimson red colour with a golden margin. It was used by the Italian horticulturist [[Carl Ludwig Sprenger|Carl Spenger]], from the Dammann establishments at [[San Giovanni a Teduccio]] near Naples, to create the "Canna with orchid flowers" or "Italian Canna", as they were known. Examples of varieties having the Canna hybrid Madame Crozy as a parent, are C. 'Austria' (1893), C. 'Italia' (1893), C. 'Alemania' (1894), C. 'Britannia' (1895), C. 'Heinrich Seidel'(1895). There is recorded knowledge of 57 cultivars originating from this prolific nursery, until its destruction by the eruption of the [[Mount Vesuvius]] volcano in the early 1900s.

==1880s Victor Lemoine==
[[Victor Lemoine]] was a resident of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France and considered to be one of the greatest horticulturists of all time, and was the first foreigner to receive the [[Victorian Medal of Horticulture]] of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]. He also received the George R. White Medal of Honor from the [[Massachusetts Horticultural Society]].

==1892 Alipore Canna Collection==
The [[Agri Horticultural Society of India]], located in [[Kolkata]], [[India]], firstly under the Secretaryship of [[Percy Lancaster]] in 1892 and later that of his son [[Sydney Percy-Lancaster]], raised the [[Alipore]] Canna Collection, which dominated canna throughout that [[continent]]. Over 100 new varieties are known to have been raised by the society during that period, as well as importing the latest favourites from [[Europe]] and later from the USA.

==1896 Luther Burbank==
Mr [[Luther Burbank]] was a celebrated horticulturist when in 1896 he released his first two Canna cultivars, C. ‘Tarrytown’ and C. ‘Burbank’. He is reputed to be the first to recognise and name the C. 'Roi Humbert' mutation, which he named as [[Canna Yellow King Humbert|C. 'Yellow King Humbert']].

His known cultivars were all of the type found in the Italian Group of Cannas.

==1900s Rozain-Boucharlat==
In the early 20th century, the [[Rozain-Boucharlat]] establishments were prolific hybidists. Their nursery’s at [[Cuires-les-Lyon]], [[France]] was the origin of many canna cultivars. Their catalog of the year 1910 documented 110 canna varieties, many of them being their own creations.

One of their principal successes was the obtaining of a pure pink colour which didn’t exist at that time (only pale pink and salmon pink existed). The obtaining of these cultivars C. ‘Francis Berthie’ and C. ‘Prince de Galles’ encouraged them to try for a purer colour. In 1922, the cultivar C. ‘Prince Charmant’ with its bright carmine pink colour brought the desired tone to the collection. This is still a popular cultivar, found in many collections.

However, the improvements didn’t stop there and in 1930, the Rozain-Boucharlat’s variety C. 'Centenaire de Rozain-Boucharlat' appeared in their list. This variety which is small, floriferous, with big spikes and carmine, lilac shaded flowers is still found at many horticulturists' and cities’ green spaces. It was released in celebration of the first 100 years of the company.

==1960s Longwood Gardens==
[[Longwood Gardens]] in the USA contributed a collection of Conservatory Group and Aquatic Group cultivars, originated by Dr Robert Armstrong the chief geneticist at Longwood Gardens, [[Pennsylvania]], USA.

==1980s Marcelle Sheppard==
Although best known for her Crinum cultivars, over the years Mrs Marcelle Sheppard has also hybridized a number of winning Cannas. One of the most exciting to look at is C. 'Zulu Rouge' with its dark (almost brown-black) foliage and bright red flowers. Many of her cultivars were distributed over the years by [[Herb Kelly Jr]].

'''Macedonian national costumes''' are part of the material culture of the [[Macedonian people]] and they are important branch of the Macedonian folk art. 

==Types==
Macedonians wore 70 different types of national costumes, depending on the region where people lived, such as: Skopska Blatija, [[Skopska Crna Gora]], Upper Polog, Lower Polog, [[Prilep]]-[[Bitola]] Plain, Upper Prespa, Lower Prespa, [[Ohrid]] Plain, Struga Plain, Drimkol, Malesija, [[Mariovo]], [[Ovče Pole]], Malesevo and many others. Every type of folk costume has its own characteristics, but common for all is the presence of the red, black and the white colour and the geometrical shapes on it.

'''Man: A Course of Study''', usually known by the acronym '''MACOS''' or '''M.A.C.O.S.''', was an [[United States|American]] [[humanities]] teaching program, popular in America and Britain in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/collection/films/fiche/?id=51241|title=Through These Eyes|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the theories of [[Jerome Bruner]], particularly his concept of the "[[spiral curriculum]]". This suggested that a concept might be taught repeatedly within a [[curriculum]], but at a number of levels, each level being more complex than the first. The process of repetition would thus enable the child to absorb more complex ideas easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/jerome-s-bruner-influential-psychologist-of-perception-dies-at-100/2016/06/07/033e5870-2cc3-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html|title=Jerome S. Bruner, Influential Psychologist of Perception, Dies at 100|publisher=The Washington Post|first=Matt|last=Schudel|date=June 7, 2016|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infed.org/mobi/jerome-bruner-and-the-process-of-education/|title=Jerome Bruner and the Process of Education|publisher=Infed|first=Mark|last=Smith|date=2002|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In MACOS, the concept was "the chain of [[life]]" or a "lifeline": the entire history of a living thing. The course started with a simple lifespan in the form of the Pacific Coast [[salmon]]. It then moved on to the more complex life form of the [[herring gull]], introducing concepts such as nurturing. The lifespan of the [[baboon]] was next examined, particularly within the societal context afforded by the [[baboon#Society|baboon troop]]. The differences between [[innate behaviour]] and [[learning|learned]] behaviour were introduced. Finally, the study opened up into a study of a man's lifespan with a case study of [[Netsilik Inuit]]. This also included the interaction between the Netsilik and other life forms, such as [[reindeer]] and [[pinniped|seals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/04/25/archives/the-proper-study-of-mankind-.html|title=The Proper Study of Mankind|publisher=The New York Times|first=Lee|last=Dembart|date=April 25, 1976|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course comprised a self-contained kit of course materials, film cassettes, visual aids, and games. Some of the activities were very imaginative; a game based upon reindeer [[wikt:migration|migration]] had a loaded [[dice|die]] to introduce discussion about instincts, and a paper seal would be cut up and shared among class members representing various people in the [[Netsilik]] community, according to a ritual governing who was entitled to which part of the animal.

The emphasis of the course was upon learning particular skills within the teaching process, not upon the significance of the content. This included the necessity to ask questions, discuss, and reach conclusions based on evidence and argument.

The course was much criticized in the United States because of its emphasis upon questioning aspects of life, including belief and morality. It was particularly targeted by [[fundamentalist]] groups, evidenced by quotations included in the course booklet. In 2004, the [[National Film Board of Canada]] produced  ''Through These Eyes'', a documentary about the controversy surrounding MACOS, and more generally about the interplay between politics and education.&lt;ref&gt;Kincheloe,  Joe L. &amp;  Horn, Raymond A.(Eds). (2006), pp. 60&amp;ndash;1. ''The Praeger Handbook of Education and Psychology: Volume 1'' {{ISBN|0-313-33123-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mazor Mausoleum''' ({{lang-he|מאוזוליאום מזור}}) is one of the best preserved [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] buildings in [[Israel]], located in [[El'ad]]. The [[Mausoleum]], which is the only [[Roman era]] building in Israel to still stand from its foundations to its roof, was built for an important Roman man and his wife in the 3rd century AD.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Their identities remain a mystery but one can still see the remnants of two [[sarcophagi]] in the mausoleum.

==Muslim Period==
{{main|Al-Muzayri'a}}
In the [[Late Antiquity]], [[Muslims]] added a [[Mihrab|prayer niche]] in the southern wall, indicating the direction of [[Mecca]], and the building became an Islamic holy place called ''[[Maqam (shrine)]] en Neby Yahyah'' (Shrine of the [[John the Baptist|Prophet John]]).&lt;ref name="SWPII"&gt; Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp02conduoft#page/365/mode/1up 365]-367&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its sacredness, the building was preserved through the ages.&lt;ref name = "goisrael"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.il/Tourism_Eng/Articles/Sites/The+Mazor+Mausoleum.htm|title=The Mazor Mausoleum|work=Ministry of Tourism - The State of Israel|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It functioned as a [[mosque]] until the depopulation of the Palestinian village Al-Muzayri'a in 1948.

In July 1949, Israel decided to raze the mausoleum, after the Israeli army had used the building  for target practice. However an antiquities inspector managed to stop the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/history-erased-1.224899 History Erased], by Meron Rapoport, [[Haaretz]], 05.07.07&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various '''names of Korea''' in use today, derived from ancient kingdoms and dynasties.  The modern English name ''[[Korea]]'' is an [[exonym]] derived from the [[Goryeo]] period&lt;ref name="Kim2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kyu Chull Kim|title=Rootless: A Chronicle of My Life Journey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l6NnVxnFMuMC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=19 September 2013|date=8 March 2012|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4685-5891-3|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used by both [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] in international contexts. In the [[Korean language]], the two Koreas use different terms to refer to the nominally unified nation: ''Chosŏn'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|[[wiktionary:조선|조선]]}}, {{lang|ko-Hang|[[wiktionary:朝鮮|朝鮮]]}}) in North Korea and ''Hanguk'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|[[wiktionary:한국|한국]]}}, {{lang|ko-Hang|[[wiktionary:韓國|韓國]]}}) in South Korea. Ethnic Koreans living in China and Japan also use the term ''Chosŏn'' to refer to Korea.

==History==
{{See also|History of Korea}}

The earliest records of Korean history are written in [[Chinese characters]] called [[hanja]]. Even after the invention of [[hangul]], Koreans generally recorded native Korean names with hanja, by [[translation]] of meaning, [[transliteration]] of sound, or even combinations of the two. Furthermore, the pronunciations of the same character are somewhat different in Korean and the various Korean dialects, and have changed over time.

For all these reasons, in addition to the sparse and sometimes contradictory written records, it is often difficult to determine the original meanings or pronunciations of ancient names.

===Ancient history===
====Gojoseon====
Until 108 BC, northern Korea and [[Manchuria]] were controlled by [[Gojoseon]]. In contemporaneous [[China|Chinese]] records, it was written as {{lang|zh-Hant|朝鮮}}, which is pronounced in modern Korean as ''Joseon'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|조선}}). The prefixing of ''Go-'' ({{lang|mul-Hant|古}}), meaning "ancient," is a historiographical convention that distinguishes it from the later [[Joseon Dynasty]]. The name Joseon is also now still used by North Koreans and Koreans living in China to refer to the peninsula, and as the official Korean form of the name of ''Democratic People's Republic of Korea''. The word is also used in many Eurasian languages to refer to the Korean Peninsula, such as Japanese, Vietnamese, and Chinese.

Possibly the [[Chinese characters]] phonetically transcribed a native Korean name, perhaps pronounced something like "Jyusin".  Some speculate that it also corresponds to Chinese references to {{lang|zh-Hant|肅愼}} ({{lang|ko-Hang|숙신}}, [[suksin]]), {{lang|zh-Hant|稷愼}} ({{lang|ko-Hang|직신}}, jiksin) and {{lang|zh-Hant|息愼}} ({{lang|ko-Hang|식신}}, siksin), although these latter names probably describe the ancestors of the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressian.com/article/article.asp?article_num=40050524180253&amp;Section=]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressian.com/article/article.asp?article_num=40080829171252&amp;Section=04]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars believe {{lang|zh-Hant|朝鮮}} was a ''translation'' of the native Korean ''[[Asadal]]'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|아사달}}), the capital of Gojoseon: ''asa'' being a hypothetical [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] root word for "morning", and ''dal'' meaning "mountain", a common ending for Goguryeo place names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urimal.cs.pusan.ac.kr/urimal_new/read/common/sisa/sisa.asp?page_num=1&amp;ID=1054&amp;search_str=&amp;section=4&amp;select= [땅이름&amp;#93; 태백산과 아사달 / 허재영] {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early attempt to translate these characters into English gave rise to the expression "The Land of the Morning Calm" for Korea, which parallels the expression "The Land of the Rising Sun" for Japan.  While the wording is fanciful, the essence of the translation is valid.

====Han====
Around the time of Gojoseon's fall, various chiefdoms in southern Korea grouped into confederacies, collectively called the [[Samhan]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|삼한}}, {{lang|ko-Hang|三韓}}, "Three ''Han''"). ''Han'' is a native Korean root for "leader" or "great", as in ''[[maripgan]]'' ("king", archaic), ''hanabi'' ("grandfather", archaic), and ''Hanbat'' ("Great Field", archaic name for [[Daejeon]]).  It may be related to the [[Mongolic languages|Mongol]]/[[Turkic languages|Turkic]] title ''[[Khan (title)|Khan]]''.

''Han'' was transliterated in Chinese records as {{lang|zh-Hant|韓}} ({{lang|ko-Hang|한}}, han), {{lang|zh-Hant|幹}} ({{lang|ko-Hang|간}}, gan), {{lang|zh-Hant|刊}} ({{lang|ko-Hang|간}}, gan), {{lang|zh-Hant|干}} ({{lang|ko-Hang|간}}, gan), or {{lang|zh-Hant|漢}} ({{lang|ko-Hang|한}}, han), but is unrelated to the Chinese people and states also called [[Han Chinese|Han]], which is a different character pronounced with a different [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. (See: [[Transliteration into Chinese characters]]).

Beginning in the 7th century, the name "[[Samhan]]" became synonymous with the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]].&lt;ref name="kyunghyang"&gt;{{cite web |last1=이기환 |title=[이기환의 흔적의 역사]국호논쟁의 전말…대한민국이냐 고려공화국이냐 |url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201708300913001&amp;code=960100&amp;www |website=경향신문 |publisher=The Kyunghyang Shinmun |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko |date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Samguk Sagi]] and [[Samguk Yusa]], [[Silla]] implemented a national policy, "Samhan Unification" ({{hangul|삼한일통}}), to integrate refugees and migrants from [[Baekje]] and [[Goguryeo]]. In 1982, a memorial stone dating back to 686 was discovered in [[Cheongju]] with an inscription: "The Three Han were unified and the domain was expanded."&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt; During the [[Later Silla]] period, the concepts of Samhan as the ancient confederacies and the Three Kingdoms of Korea were merged.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt; In a letter to an imperial tutor of the Tang dynasty, [[Choe Chiwon]] equated Byeonhan to Baekje, Jinhan to Silla, and Mahan to Goguryeo.&lt;ref name="chosun"&gt;{{cite web |last1=이덕일 |title=[이덕일 사랑] 대~한민국 |url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/08/14/2008081401512.html |website=조선닷컴 |publisher=Chosun Ilbo |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Goryeo]] period, Samhan became a common name to refer to all of Korea.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt; In his Ten Mandates to his descendants, [[Wang Geon]] declared that he had unified the Three Han (Samhan), referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chosun" /&gt; Samhan continued to be a common name for Korea during the [[Joseon]] period and was widely referenced in the [[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt;

In China, the Three Kingdoms of Korea were collectively called Samhan since the beginning of the 7th century.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite web |title=고현묘지명(高玄墓誌銘) |url=http://gsm.nricp.go.kr/_third/user/frame.jsp?View=search&amp;No=4&amp;ksmno=7190 |website=한국금석문 종합영상정보시스템 |publisher=National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the name Samhan to indicate the Three Kingdoms of Korea was widespread in the [[Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref name="kwon"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deok-young |first1=Kwon |title=An inquiry into the name of Three Kingdom(三國) inscribed on the epitaph of T’ang(唐) period |journal=The Journal of Korean Ancient History |date=2014 |volume=75 |pages=105–137 |url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE02486618 |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko |issn=1226-6213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goguryeo was alternately called [[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]] by the Tang dynasty, as evidenced by a Tang document that called Goguryeo generals "Mahan leaders" ({{Korean|마한추장|馬韓酋長|labels=no}}) in 645.&lt;ref name="National" /&gt; In 651, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] sent a message to the king of Baekje referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea as Samhan.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt; Epitaphs of the Tang dynasty, including those belonging to Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla refugees and migrants, called the Three Kingdoms of Korea "Samhan", especially Goguryeo.&lt;ref name="kwon" /&gt; For example, the epitaph of Go Hyeon ({{Korean|고현|高玄|labels=no}}), a Tang dynasty general of Goguryeo origin who died in 690, calls him a "Liaodong Samhan man" ({{Korean|요동 삼한인|遼東 三韓人|labels=no}}).&lt;ref name="National" /&gt; The [[History of Liao]] equates Byeonhan to Silla, Jinhan to Buyeo, and Mahan to Goguryeo.&lt;ref name="chosun" /&gt;

The "Han" in the names of the [[Korean Empire]], ''Daehan Jeguk'', and the [[Republic of Korea]] (South Korea), ''Daehan Minguk'' or ''Hanguk'', are named in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chosun" /&gt;

====Goryeo====
Around the beginning of the [[Common Era]], remnants of the fallen Gojoseon were re-united and expanded by the kingdom of [[Goguryeo]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]].  It, too, was a native Korean word, probably pronounced something like "Guri", transcribed with various hanja characters: {{lang|zh-Hant|高句麗}}, {{lang|zh-Hant|高勾麗}}, or {{lang|zh-Hant|高駒麗}} ({{lang|ko-Hang|고구려}}, Goguryeo), {{lang|zh-Hant|高麗}} ({{lang|ko-Hang|고려}}, Goryeo), {{lang|zh-Hant|高離}} ({{lang|ko-Hang|고리}}, Gori), or {{lang|zh-Hant|句麗}} ({{lang|ko-Hang|구려}}, Guryeo).
The source native name is thought to be either *''Guru'' ("walled city, castle, fortress"; attested in Chinese historical documents, but not in native Korean sources) or *''Gauri'' ("center, middle"; cf. Middle Korean ''*gaβɔndɔy'' and Standard Modern Korean ''gaunde'' {{lang|ko-Hang|가운데}}).

The theory that Goguryeo referenced the founder's surname has been largely discredited (the royal surname changed from ''Hae'' to ''Go'' long after the state's founding).

===Revival of the names===
In the south, the Samhan resolved into the kingdoms of [[Baekje]] and [[Silla]], constituting, with Goguryeo, the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. In 668, Silla unified the three kingdoms, and reigned as [[Later Silla]] until 935. The name [[Samhan]] became synonymous with the Three Kingdoms of Korea beginning in the 7th century, and by the Goryeo period it became a common name to refer to all of Korea.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt;

The succeeding dynasty called itself [[Goryeo]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|고려}}, {{lang|ko-Hant|高麗}}), and regarded itself as the successor of [[Goguryeo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rossabi|first1=Morris|title=China Among Equals: The Middle Kingdom and Its Neighbors, 10th-14th Centuries|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520045620|page=323|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNpD5UKmkswC&amp;q=%22As+the+self-proclaimed+successor+to+Koguryo+and+the+protector+of+Parhae+refugees%2C+many+of+them+of+Koguryo+origin%2C+Koryo+considered+the+northern+territories+in+Manchuria+its+rightful+legacy.%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22As%20the%20self-proclaimed%20successor%20to%20Koguryo%20and%20the%20protector%20of%20Parhae%20refugees%2C%20many%20of%20them%20of%20Koguryo%20origin%2C%20Koryo%20considered%20the%20northern%20territories%20in%20Manchuria%20its%20rightful%20legacy.%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yi|first1=Ki-baek|title=A New History of Korea|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674615762|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2mdVwXpMzwC&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Djun Kil|title=The History of Korea|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313038532|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ci_iGuAAqmsC&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grayson|first1=James H.|title=Korea - A Religious History|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136869259|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LU78AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Goryeo (also spelled as ''Koryŏ'') was the shortened form of Goguryeo (also spelled as ''Koguryŏ'') and was first used during the reign of [[Jangsu of Goguryeo|Jangsu]] in the 5th century. Through the [[Silk Road]] trade routes, [[Islam in Korea#Early history|Muslim merchants]] brought knowledge about Silla and Goryeo to [[India]] and the [[Middle East]]. Goryeo was transliterated into [[Italian language|Italian]] as "Cauli", the name [[Marco Polo]] used when mentioning the country in his ''Travels,'' derived from the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] form ''Gāolí''.

In 1392, a new dynasty established by a military coup revived the name [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|조선}}, {{lang|ko-Hant|朝鮮}}). The hanja were often translated into English as "morning calm/sun",&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=FGI7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=chosun+morning+fresh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIldKIw8qIxgIVxg6sCh3vRQDj#v=onepage&amp;q=chosun%20morning%20fresh&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and Korea's English nickname became '''"The Land''' '''of the Morning Calm";''' however, this interpretation is not often used in the Korean language, and is more familiar to Koreans as a [[Translation#Back-translation|back-translation]] from English. This nickname was coined by [[Percival Lowell]] in his book, "Choson, the Land of the Morning Calm," published in 1885.

In 1897, the nation was renamed ''Daehan Jeguk'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|대한제국}}, {{lang|ko-Hant|大韓帝國}}, literally, "Great Han Empire", known in English as [[Korean Empire]]). ''Han'' had been selected in reference to ''Samhan'', specifically the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=이기환 |title=[이기환의 흔적의 역사]국호논쟁의 전말…대한민국이냐 고려공화국이냐 |url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201708300913001&amp;code=960100&amp;www |website=경향신문 |publisher=The Kyunghyang Shinmun |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko |date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=이덕일 |title=[이덕일 사랑] 대~한민국 |url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/08/14/2008081401512.html |website=조선닷컴 |publisher=Chosun Ilbo |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, ''Daehan Jeguk'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|대한제국}}, {{lang|ko-Hant|大韓帝國}}) means it is an empire that rules the area of [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. This name was used to emphasize independence of Korea, because an empire can't be a subordinate country.

===20th century===
When the Korean Empire came under [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] in 1910, the name reverted to ''Joseon'' (officially, the Japanese pronunciation ''Chōsen'').  During this period, many different groups outside of Korea fought for independence, the most notable being the '''Daehan Minguk Imsi Jeongbu''' ({{lang|ko-Hang|대한민국 임시정부}}, {{lang|ko|大韓民國臨時政府}}), literally the "Provisional Government of the Great Han People's Nation", known in English as the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] ({{lang|mul-Hant|民國}} = {{lang|mul-Hant|民}}&amp;nbsp;‘people’ + {{lang|mul-Hant|國}}&amp;nbsp;country/nation’ = ‘republic’ in East Asian capitalist societies).&lt;ref&gt;Actually Republic is {{lang|mul-Hant|共和國}} {{lang|ko-Hang|공화국}} (″Mutually peaceful country″) as can be seen in the names of China and North Korea but Taiwan and South Korea coined the latter {{lang|mul-Hant|民國}} {{lang|ko-Hang|민국}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korea became independent after [[World War II]] (1945) and the country was then [[Division of Korea|divided]].

In 1948, the South adopted the provisional government's name of '''Daehan Minguk''' ({{lang|ko-Hang|대한민국}}, {{lang|ko-Hant|大韓民國}}; see above), known in English as the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]]. Meanwhile, the North became the '''Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk''' ({{lang|ko-Hang|조선민주주의인민공화국}}, {{lang|ko-Hant|朝鮮民主主義人民共和國}}) literally the "Chosŏn Democratic People Republic", known in English as the [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]]. The name itself was adopted from the short-lived [[People's Republic of Korea]] (PRK) formed in Seoul after liberation and later added the word "democratic" to its title.&lt;ref&gt;The North Korean Revolution, 1945–1950  By Charles K. Armstrong&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage==
[[File:Korean Peninsula.jpg|thumb|A South Korean map of the Korean Peninsula: [[Korea]] is called ''Chosŏn'' (조선, 朝鮮) in [[North Korea]] and ''Hanguk'' (한국, 韓國) in [[South Korea]].]]
===East Asia===
====Korea====
Today, South Koreans use ''Hanguk'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KR|한국}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KR|韓國}}) to refer to just South Korea or Korea as a whole, ''Namhan'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KR|남한}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KR|南韓}}; "South Han") for South Korea, and ''Bukhan'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KR|북한}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KR|北韓}}; "North Han") for North Korea. South Korea less formally refers to North Korea as ''Ibuk'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KR|이북}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KR|以北}}; "The North"). South Koreans often refer to Korea as "uri nara" ({{lang|ko-Hang-KR|우리 나라}}), meaning "our nation" or "our country". In addition, the official name for the Republic of Korea in the Korean language is "Daehan Minguk" ({{lang|ko-Hang-KR|대한민국}}, {{lang|ko-Hang-KR|大韓民國}}; which is usually translated as "The Republic of Korea").

North Koreans use ''Chosŏn'', ''Namjosŏn'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KP|남조선}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KP|南朝鮮}}; "South Chosŏn"), and ''Bukchosŏn'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KP|북조선}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KP|北朝鮮}}; "North Chosŏn") when referring to Korea, South Korea, and North Korea, respectively. The term ''Bukchosŏn'', however, is rarely used in the north, although it may be found in pre-war sources, such as the [[Song of General Kim Il-sung]].

In the tourist regions in North Korea and the official meetings between South Korea and North Korea, ''Namcheuk'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KR|남측}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KR|南側}}) and ''Bukcheuk'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KR|북측}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KR|北側}}), or "southern side" and "northern side", are used instead of ''Namhan'' and ''Bukhan''.

The [[Korean language]] is called ''Hangukeo'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KR|한국어}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KR|韓國語}}, referring to the Korean language) or ''Hangukmal'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KR|한국말}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KR|韓國말}}, referring to spoken Korean only) in the South and ''Chosŏnmal'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KP|조선말}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KP|朝鮮말}}) or ''Chosŏnŏ'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KP|조선어}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KP|朝鮮語}}) in the North.  The Korean script is called [[hangul|hangeul]] ({{lang|ko-Hang-KR|한글}}) in South Korea and ''Chosŏn'gŭl'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KP|조선글}}) in North Korea. The [[Korean Peninsula]] is called ''Hanbando'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KR|한반도}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KR|韓半島}}) in the South and ''Chosŏn Pando'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KP|조선반도}}, {{lang|ko-Hant-KP|朝鮮半島}}) in the North.

====Chinese-speaking areas====
In [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-speaking areas such as [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]], different naming conventions on several terms have been practiced according to their political proximity to whichever Korean government although there is a growing trend for convergence.

In the Chinese language, the Korean Peninsula is usually called ''Cháoxiǎn Bàndǎo'' ({{zh|s=朝鲜半岛|t=朝鮮半島}}) and in rare cases called ''Hán Bàndǎo'' ({{zh|s=韩半岛|t=韓半島}}). Ethnic Koreans are also called ''Cháoxiǎnzú'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|朝鲜族}}), instead of ''Dàhán mínzú'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|大韓民族}}). However, the term ''Hánguó ren'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|韩国人}}) may be used to specifically refer to South Koreans.

Before establishing diplomatic relations with South Korea, the [[People's Republic of China]] tended to use the historic Korean name ''Cháoxiǎn'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|朝鲜}} "Joseon" or "Chosŏn"), by referring to South Korea as ''Nán Cháoxiǎn'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|南朝鲜}} "South Joseon"). Since diplomatic ties were restored, China has used the names that each of the two sides prefer, by referring to North Korea as ''Cháoxiǎn'' and to South Korea as ''Hánguó'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|韩国}} "Hanguk"). The Korean language can be referred to as either ''Cháoxiǎnyǔ'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|朝鲜语}}) or ''Hánguóyǔ'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|韩国语}}). The [[Korean War]] is officially called the ''Kàngměi Yuáncháo Zhànzhēng'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|抗美援朝战争}} "War to Resist America and Aid Korea") although the term ''Cháoxiǎn Zhànzhēng'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|朝鲜战争}}) is also used in unofficial contexts.

[[Taiwan]], on the other hand, uses the South Korean names, referring to North Korean as ''Běihán'' ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|北韓}} "North Han") and South Korean as ''Nánhán'' ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|南韓}} "South Han"). The [[Republic of China]] previously maintained diplomatic relations with South Korea, but has never had relations with North Korea. As a result, in the past, ''Hánguó'' ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|韓國}}) had been used to refer to the whole Korea, and Taiwanese textbooks treated Korea as a unified nation. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China]] under the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] Government considered North and South Koreas two separate countries. However, general usage in Taiwan is still to refer to North Korea as ''Běihán'' ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|北韓}} "North Han[guk]") and South Korea as ''Nánhán'' ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|南韓}} "South Han[guk]") while use of {{lang|zh-Hant-TW|朝鮮}} – which in Taiwan is not pronounced ''Cháoxiǎn'' but ''Cháo'''xiān''''' – is generally limited to ancient Korea. The Korean language is usually referred to as ''Hányǔ'' ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|韓語}}).

Similarly, general usage in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] has traditionally referred to North Korea as ''Bak Hon'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|北韓}} "North Han") and South Korea as ''Nam Hon'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|南韓}} "South Han"). Under the influence of official usage, which is itself influenced by the official usage of the [[People's Republic of China]] government, the mainland practice of naming the two Koreas differently has become more common.

In the Chinese language used in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]], North Korea is usually called ''Cháoxiǎn'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-SG|朝鲜}} "Chosŏn") with ''Běi Cháoxiǎn'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-SG|北朝鲜}}  "North Chosŏn") and ''Běihán'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-SG|北韩}} "North Han") less often used, while South Korea is usually called ''Hánguó'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-SG|韩国}} "Hanguk") with ''Nánhán'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-SG|南韩}} "South Han[guk]") and ''Nán Cháoxiǎn'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-SG|南朝鲜}} "South Chosŏn") less often used.

In [[Hokkien]] speaking areas of chinese communities in countries like Taiwan and around [[Southeast Asia]], Korea is called ''Hân-kok'' ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|韓國}} "Hanguk") where North Korea is referred to as ''Pak-hân'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|北韓}} "North Han") and South Korea as ''Lâm-hân'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|南韓}} "South Han").

The above usage pattern does not apply for Korea-derived words. For example, Korean [[ginseng]] is commonly called ''Gāolì shēn'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|高麗參}}).

====Japan====
In [[Japan]], North Korea is called ''Kita-Chōsen'' ({{lang|ja|北朝鮮}}; "North Chosŏn") and South Korea ''Kankoku'' ({{lang|ja|韓国}} "Hanguk").

However, [[Zainichi Koreans|Japan-based North Koreans]] claim the name ''Kita-Chōsen'' is derogatory, as it only refers to the northern part of Korean Peninsula, whereas the government claims the sovereignty over its whole territory.&lt;ref&gt;Shane Green, [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/11/05/1068013255536.html Treaty plan could end Korean War], The Age, November 6, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-North people such as [[Chongryon]] use the name ''Kyōwakoku'' ({{lang|ja|共和国}}; "the Republic") instead, but the ambiguous name is not popular among others. In 1972 Chongryon campaigned to get the Japanese media to stop referring to North Korea as ''Kita-Chōsen''. This effort was not successful, but as a compromise most media companies agreed to refer to the nation with its full official title at least once in every article, thus they used the lengthy ''Kita-Chōsen (Chōsen Minshu-shugi Jinmin Kyōwakoku)'' ({{lang|ja|北朝鮮(朝鮮民主主義人民共和国)}} "North Chosŏn (The People's Democratic Republic of Chosŏn)"). By January 2003, this policy started to be abandoned by most newspapers, starting with ''[[Tokyo Shimbun]]'', which announced that it would no longer write out the full name,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gally.net/leavings/00/0013.html ''Tokyo Shimbun'', December 31, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''[[Asahi Shimbun|Asahi]]'', ''[[Mainichi]]'', and ''[[The Nikkei|Nikkei]]''  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gally.net/leavings/00/0022.html ''Asahi'', ''Mainichi'', and ''Nikkei'']&lt;/ref&gt;

For Korea as a whole,  ''Chōsen'' ({{lang|ja|朝鮮}}; "Joseon") is commonly used. The term Chōsen, which has a longer usage history, continues to be used to refer to the Korean peninsula, the Korean ethnic group, and the Korean language, which are use cases that won't cause confusion between Korea and North Korea. When referring to both North Korean and South Korean nationals,  the [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] of [[gairaigo|phonetic English]] ''Korean'' ({{lang|ja|コリアン}}, ''Korian'') may be used because a reference to a Chōsen national may be interpreted as a North Korean national instead.

The [[Korean language]] is most frequently referred to in Japan as ''Kankokugo'' ({{lang|ja|韓国語}}) or ''Chōsengo'' ({{lang|ja|朝鮮語}}). While academia mostly prefers ''Chōsengo'', ''Kankokugo'' became more and more common in non-academic fields, thanks to the economic and cultural presence of South Korea. The language is also referred to as various combined terms, such as ''Kankoku-Chōsen-go'' ({{lang|ja|韓国朝鮮語}}), ''Chōsen-Kankoku-go'' ({{lang|ja|朝鮮・韓国語}}), "Kankokugo (Chōsengo)" ({{lang|ja|韓国語(朝鮮語)}}), etc. Some people refer to the language as ''Koriago'' ({{lang|ja|コリア語}}), using the European name for Korea. This term is not used in ordinary Japanese, but was selected as a compromise to placate both nations in a euphemistic process called ''[[kotobagari]]''. Likewise, when [[NHK]] broadcasts a language instruction program for Korean, the language is referred to as ''hangurugo'' ({{lang|ja|ハングル語}}; "hangul language"); although it's technically incorrect since [[hangul]] itself is a writing system, not a language.&lt;ref&gt;In the program, however, teachers avoid the name ''Hangurugo'', by always saying ''this language''. They would say, for instance, "In this language, ''Annyeong haseyo'' means 'Hello{{'"}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that even ''Hangurugo'' is not completely neutral, since North Korea calls the letter ''Chosŏn'gŭl'', not ''hangul''. ''Urimaru'' ({{lang|ja|ウリマル}}), a direct transcription of ''uri mal'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KR|우리 말}}, "our language") is sometimes used by Korean residents in Japan, as well as by [[KBS World Radio]]. This term, however, may not be suitable to ethnic Japanese whose "our language" is not necessarily Korean.

''Uri'' (우리 "we/us/our") is the first-person plural pronoun and it is commonly used as a prefix in Korean terms to describe things that are Korean, such as ''uri nara'' (우리 나라, "our country") which is yet another name Koreans give their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hyunjinmoon.com/uri-the-korean-notion-of-the-collective-self/|title=&lt;span lang="ko"&gt;우리&lt;/span&gt; (Uri) – The Korean Notion of the Collective Self|last=Hyunjinmoon|website=www.hyunjinmoon.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, those who moved to Japan usually maintain their distinctive cultural heritages (such as the Baekje-towns or Goguryeo-villages). Ethnic [[Koreans in Japan|Korean residents of Japan]] have been collectively called ''Zainichi Chōsenjin'' ({{lang|ja|在日朝鮮人}} "Joseon People in Japan"), regardless of nationality. However, for the same reason as above, the euphemism ''Zainichi Korian'' ({{lang|ja|在日コリアン}}; "Koreans in Japan") is increasingly used today. ''Zainichi'' ({{lang|ja|在日}}; "In Japan") itself is also often used colloquially. People with [[Nationality Law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|North Korean nationality]] are called ''Zainichi Chōsenjin'', while those with [[South Korean nationality law|South Korean nationality]], sometimes including recent newcomers, are called ''Zainichi Kankokujin'' ({{lang|ja|在日韓国人}} "Hanguk People in Japan").

====Mongolia====
Mongols have their own word for Korea: Солонгос (''Solongos''). In [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], ''solongo'' means "rainbow." And another theory is probably means derived from [[Evenks|Solon tribe]] living in Manchuria, a tribe culturally and ethnically related to the Korean people.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} North and South Korea are, accordingly, Хойд Солонгос (''Hoid Solongos'') and Өмнөд Солонгос (''Ömnöd Solongos'').&lt;br /&gt;
Other theory:&lt;br /&gt;
The name of either [[Silla]] or its capital Seora-beol was also widely used throughout Northeast Asia as the ethnonym for the people of Silla, appearing [...] as '''Solgo''' or '''Solho''' in the language of the medieval Jurchens and their later descendants, the Manchus respectively.

====Vietnamese-speaking areas====
In Vietnam, people call North Korea ''{{lang|vi|Triều Tiên}}'' ({{lang|mul-Hant|朝鮮}}; "Chosŏn") and South Korea ''{{lang|vi|Hàn Quốc}}'' ({{lang|mul-Hant|韓國}}; "Hanguk"). Prior to unification, [[North Vietnam]] used ''{{lang|vi|Bắc Triều Tiên}}'' ({{lang|mul-Hant|北朝鮮}}; Bukchosŏn) and ''{{lang|vi|Nam Triều Tiên}}'' ({{lang|mul-Hant|南朝鮮}}; Namjoseon) while [[South Vietnam]] used ''{{lang|vi|Bắc Hàn}}'' ({{lang|mul-Hant|北韓}}; Bukhan) and ''{{lang|vi|Nam Hàn}}'' ({{lang|mul-Hant|南韓}}; Namhan) for North and South Korea, respectively. After unification, the northern Vietnamese terminology persisted until the 1990s. When South Korea reestablished diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 1993, it requested that Vietnam use the name that it uses for itself, and ''{{lang|vi|Hàn Quốc}}'' gradually replaced ''{{lang|vi|Nam Triều Tiên}}'' in usage.

In the Vietnamese language used in the United States, ''Bắc Hàn'' and ''Nam Hàn'' are most common used.

===Outside East Asia===

====English usage====
Both South and North Korea use the name "Korea" when referring to their countries in English. North Korea is sometimes referred to as "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" (DPRK) and South Korea is sometimes referred to as the "Republic Of Korea" (ROK). The official names of both entities are also used by organizations such as [[United Nations]], [[International Olympic Committee]] and media such as the [[Associated Press]], [[China Global Television Network]], and several others.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chinadailyhk.com/articles/27/25/44/1522321435932.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

As with other European languages, English historically had a variety of names for Korea. These included "Cauli" (Marco Polo's rendering of ''Goryeo''), Caule, Core, Cory, Caoli, and Corai as well as two spellings that survived into the 19th century, Corea and Korea. The modern spelling, "Korea", first appeared in the late 17th century in the travel writings of the [[Dutch East India Company]]'s [[Hendrick Hamel]]. The terms "Chosunese" or "Chosonese" were first used to refer to the people of [[Joseon]] in the late 19th century but were eventually phased out.&lt;ref&gt;The Korean Repository, Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the coexistence of the spellings "Corea" and "Korea" in 19th-century English publications, Koreans believe that Japan, around the time of the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]], intentionally standardised the spelling on "Korea", so that "Japan" would appear first alphabetically.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"&gt;Barbara Demick. [http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2003/09/18/breaking_the_occupation_spell/ "Breaking the occupation spell: Some Koreans see putdown in letter change in name."] ''[[Boston Globe]]''. 18 September 2003. Retrieved 5 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Both major English-speaking governments of the time (i.e. the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] and its [[British Empire|Empire]]) used both "Korea" and "Corea" until the early part of the colonial period.&lt;ref name=Corea&gt;{{cite web|title=Korea versus Corea|url=http://www.monster-island.net/2005/05/korea-versus-corea.html|accessdate=10 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125161745/http://www.monster-island.net/2005/05/korea-versus-corea.html|archivedate=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos1.blogger.com/img/244/3976/1024/_Corea_palanquin_postcard.jpg Korea from around 1913 using the spelling "Corean"]&lt;/ref&gt; English-language publications in the 19th century generally used the spelling Corea, which was also used at the founding of the British embassy in Seoul in 1890.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe" /&gt; However, the U.S. [[Minister (diplomacy)|minister]] and [[consul general]] to Korea, [[Horace Newton Allen]], used "Korea" in his works published on the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace Newton Allen|H. N. Allen, MD]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=DgeQVx0KS_sC&amp;pg=PP11 ''Korean Tales: Being a Collection of Stories Translated from the Korean Folk Lore'']. New York: [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]], 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; At the official Korean exhibit at the [[World's Columbian Exhibition]] in Chicago in 1893 a sign was posted by the Korean Commissioner saying of his country's name that "'Korea' and 'Corea' are both correct, but the former is preferred."&lt;ref name=columbian&gt;"Korea in the White City: Korea at the World's Columbian Exhibition (1893)." ''Transactions of the Korea Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society'' 77 (2002), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have had something to do with Allen's influence, as he was heavily involved in the planning and participation of the Korean exhibit at Chicago.&lt;ref name=columbian /&gt; 

A shift can also be seen in Korea itself, where postage stamps issued in 1884 used the name "Corean Post" in English, but those from 1885 and thereafter used "Korea" or "Korean Post".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040125121802/http://www.pennfamily.org/KSS-USA/kss-korbase.html KSS-Korbase's Korean Stamp Issuance Schedules]&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Korea 1900 stamp - 2 ri.jpg|1900 stamp reading "Imperial Korean Post"
&lt;/gallery&gt;

By the first two decades of the 20th century, "Korea" began to be seen more frequently than "Corea" – a change that coincided with Japan's consolidation of its grip over the peninsula. Most evidence of a deliberate name change orchestrated by Japanese authorities is circumstantial, including a 1912 memoir by a Japanese colonial official that complained of the Koreans' tendency "to maintain they are an independent country by insisting on using a C to write their country's name."&lt;ref name="Boston Globe" /&gt; However, the spelling "Corea" was occasionally used even under full colonial rule and both it and "Korea" were largely eschewed in favor of the Japanese-derived "Chosen",&lt;ref name="Corea"/&gt; which itself was derived from "Joseon".

====Other languages====
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
European languages use variations of the name "Korea" for both North and South Korea. In general, [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Romance languages]] spell it "Corea" (or variations) since "c" represents the /k/ sound in most Romance and Celtic orthographies. However, [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Slavic languages]] largely use variants of "Korea" since, in many of these languages, "c" represents other sounds such as /ts/. In languages using other alphabets such as [[Russian language|Russian]] ([[Cyrillic]]), variations phonetically similar to "Korea" are also used for example the Russian name for Korea is Корея, romanization Koreya. Outside of Europe, most languages also use variants of "Korea", often adopted to local orthographies. "Korea" in the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin (Korean state)|Jin]]'s national language (Jurchen) is "Sogo". "Korea" in the conlang Esperanto is "Koreio". "Korea" in Hmong is "Kauslim". Within [[Spain]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Navarre]] regions use the spelling "Korea" in their [[Basque language]], while the rest of the country uses "Corea", but this usage is related to national language politics rather than international usage.

===Koreans abroad===
Emigrants who moved to [[Russia]] and [[Central Asia]] call themselves ''[[Goryeoin]]'' or ''[[Koryo-saram]]'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|고려인}}; {{lang|ko-Hant|高麗人}}; literally "person or people of Goryeo"), or ''Koreytsi'' ({{lang|ru|корейцы}}) in [[Russian language|Russian]]. Many Goryeoin are living in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], including an estimated 106,852 in [[Russia]], 22,000 in [[Uzbekistan]], 20,000 in [[Kyrgyzstan]], 17,460 in [[Kazakhstan]], 8,669 in [[Ukraine]], 2,000 in [[Belarus]], 350 in [[Moldova]], 250 in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], 100 in [[Azerbaijan]], and 30 in [[Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Commonwealth of Independent States Report'', 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, there are also 1.9 million ethnic Koreans living in China who hold Chinese citizenship and a further 560,000 Korean expatriates from both North and South living in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade |publication-place=South Korea |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-05-21 |url = http://www.mofat.go.kr/consul/overseascitizen/compatriotcondition/index6.jsp?TabMenu=TabMenu6 |script-title = ko:재외동포현황 Current Status of Overseas Compatriots |ref=CITEREFMOFAT2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=China.org.cn|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/EthnicGroups/136926.htm|title=The Korean Ethnic Group|accessdate=2009-02-06|date=2005-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korean Americans may refer to themselves as [[Korean American|Jaemi&lt;small&gt;(-)&lt;/small&gt;gyopo]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|재미교포}}; {{lang|ko-Hant|在美僑胞}}, or "temporary residents in America"), or sometimes simply "gyopo" for short.

'''Naparay''', in African [[anthropological]] study, is non-linear conception of human life held by some [[West African]] peoples such as the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]. Similar to [[reincarnation]], naparay holds that lives are cyclic and that attributes of previous lives may carry over to a new life. 

Its followers may invoke ritual practices to determine if a young child is in fact an "elder" - including rituals undertaken while the future mother is pregnant. In naparay, all people are considered to have had previous lives.  However, the extent to which they carry their past lives with them into the present is determined by these [[ritual]] practices. A newborn with the capability, or "life force",&lt;ref&gt;The term ''naparay'' strictly refers to the degree of "presence" of previous lives.&lt;/ref&gt; of an elder may be deferred to as an elder, for example being called "[[Baba (honorific)|Baba]]" (father, elder) and be trained to lead ceremonies at a young age. Naparay is seen as the method by which ancient knowledge is passed on to present society. Rituals and prayer are performed during early pregnancy to guide the vital force of the recently deceased toward the new child.

Western [[Anthropologist|anthropologists]] believe than naparay limits the accumulation of power among a small group within a community. Attributing wisdom and experience to the young allows new and competing leaders to emerge. Anthropologists also note that nothing in the [[mythology]] of naparay prevents females from being considered to possess a strong "life force" in equality with males, yet the culture almost always attributes strong naparay to males only.

The '''[[orthography]] of the [[Old Norse language]]''' was diverse, being written in both [[Runic alphabet|Runic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] alphabets, with many spelling conventions, variant letterforms, and unique letters and signs. In modern times, scholars established a standardized spelling for the language. When Old Norse names are used in texts in other languages, modifications to this spelling are often made. In particular, the names of [[Norse mythology|Old Norse mythological figures]] often have several different spellings.

The appearance of Old Norse in a written runic form first dates back to approximately 200–300 A.D.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of the Vikings |last=Jones |first=Gwyn |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1968 |pages=71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are remains of [[Viking runestones]] from the [[Viking Age]] today they are rare, and vary in use of orthography depending on when they were created.  Rune stones created near the end of the Viking Age tend to have a greater influence from Old English runes.

An understanding of the writing system of Old Norse is crucial for fully understanding the Old Norse language.  Studies of remaining rune stones from the Viking Age reveal many nuances about the spoken language, such as the constant use of alliteration.  A comparison of various whetstones from this time period with the works of [[Snorri Sturluson]] reveal that alliteration was common in many Old Norse writings, and were not only present in skaldic works.  This would then suggest that the Vikings closely tied their language to their auditory sense, which in turn would have helped with the continual transfer of their cultural memory, which was also closely tied to their language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shulte |first=Michael |date=2007 |title=Scripta islandica: Memory culture in the viking age: The runic evidence of formulaic patterns |journal=Scripta Islandica |volume=58 |pages=57–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin alphabet orthography ==

The following table gives various attested spellings of sounds and their [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription. In general usage, an orthographic distinction of phones or phonemes is not necessarily held by every writer. For example, an author may only distinguish some vowels by length, and orthographic devices could be mixed and matched. Where the table lists a long-or-short phoneme /(ː)/, a specifically short // or long /ː/ phoneme represents additional spellings not covered by length marking rules. Likewise, a phonetic entry only lists spellings not used by the equivalent phoneme(s). N/A is used when no specific spelling is used, e.g. where all long vowel spellings are found using the rules for deriving long vowel spellings from the short vowel, or no general spelling is used, e.g. when short and long vowels are always spelled differently.

When dialectal mergers such as OEN monophthongization took place, regional spelling often changed to reflect this. Sometimes, both phonemes' spellings would be used, but confused.

The epenthetic vowel had different regional spellings. In East Norse it was commonly spelled as {{angbr|e}} or {{angbr|a}}, while in West Norse it was often spelled {{angbr|u}}, almost always so in Iceland.

=== Manuscript spelling ===
The original [[Icelandic manuscripts]] which are the main source of our knowledge of [[Norse mythology]] did not employ a unified system of spelling. During the Viking Age, many dialects of Old Norse were spoken.  While they appear to have been mutually intelligible, the slight variances resulted in various spelling.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Vikings|last=Jones|first=Gwyn|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1968|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the same name might be spelled several different ways even in the original manuscripts. Letters unique to the language existed, such as a modified version of the letter [[Wynn]] called [[Vend (letter)|Vend]] that was used briefly for the sounds {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/v/}}, and {{IPA|/w/}}. In particular, the length of [[vowel]]s was only sporadically marked in many manuscripts and various [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]]ed vowels were often not distinguished from others. Another complication is that several [[Scribal abbreviation|shortcut forms]] for common words, syllables, and grammatical endings developed. One example is the use of the [[rune]] named ''{{lang|non|[[man (word)|maðr]]}}'' (man) for the word ''{{lang|non|maðr}}''. Another is the use of a special [[glyph]] for the various r-endings so common in Old Norse. These scribal abbreviations are categorized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090905003024/http://www.staff.hum.ku.dk/mjd/abbreviations.html Abbreviations in Old Norse-Icelandic manuscripts]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Suspension, truncation, or curtailment: Certain letters of the word are omitted, with the abbreviation indicated by a superscript stroke (esp. dropping a nasal), dot(s) beside the letter, or occasionally a colon. Examples: [[Ꝥ]] for þat (etc.), ū for um, hō for hón, þan̅ for þann; .kgr. for konungr, .s. for sonr.
* Contraction: The first and last letters are written, and the abbreviation is indicated by a dot or superscript stroke.
* Special signs or [[brevigraph]]s: Symbols replacing words or syllables. Examples: [[Tironian et]] (⁊) for ''{{lang|non|ok}}'', [[Man (word)#Mannaz rune|ᛘ]] for ''{{lang|non|maðr}}'', syllabic et (Ꝫꝫ) in ''{{lang|non|mꝫ (með)}}'' for {{IPA|/eð/}}.
* Superscript letters: Regular letters contained in the word or letters specifically for abbreviation purposes. Often with syllabic content. Examples: sᵏ (''{{lang|non|sik}}''), a zig-zag shaped symbol mainly for ''{{lang|non|er}}'' and ''{{lang|non|ir}}'' in ''{{lang|non|u͛a (vera)}}''.

These abbreviation conventions and a majority of the signs are inherited from the [[Latin language]] itself, and were common to the [[Latin alphabet]] in other languages. However, other signs or conventions are specifically Norse, such as the ''{{lang|non|er}}'' zig-zag.

=== Normalized spelling ===

"Normalized spelling" can be used to refer to normalization in general or the standard normalization in particular. With normalized spelling, the manuscript spelling is altered to adhere to be more strict and regular. These respellings are designed to be [[phoneme|phonemically]] precise rather than representative of the manuscripts. The degree of normalization may vary, but in general the text is at the end reduced to limited deviation from a regularized system, perhaps at the expense of some dialectal character.

For various reasons 19th century scholars came up with a '''standardized normalization''' of Old Norse which remains in use. It is primarily based on the so-called [[First Grammatical Treatise]]. [[Vowel length]] is marked and umlauted vowels are unambiguously represented. The standardized spelling employs a few characters that are not available in the most common electronic [[character set]]s. Replacements are often used, particularly in electronic formats. The most consequential is the use of [[ö]] instead of [[ogonek#E caudata and o caudata|ǫ]].

=== Transcription of Danish and Swedish runestones ===
When transcribing Old Norse texts from Danish and Swedish [[runestone]]s, many scholars,&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Rundata]] transcriptions.&lt;/ref&gt; but not all,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://skaldic.arts.usyd.edu.au/db.php?table=database the Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages project].&lt;/ref&gt; use an orthography that is adapted to represent Old East Norse, the dialect of Old Norse in [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]. The main differences are the [[diphthong]] ''æi'' instead of ''ei'' as in ''{{lang|non|stæinn}}'' ("stone") and ''i'' instead of the [[semivowel|glide]] ''j'' as in ''{{lang|non|giald}}'' ("payment"). In this standard, the [[Old Norse#U-umlaut|u-umlauted]] ''a'' represented by ǫ is not usually considered, but rendered as the underlying ''a'', as in the name ''{{lang|non|Anundʀ}}''. Another difference is the representation of the phoneme '''ʀ''', instead of simply ''r'' as in West Norse, where the ''ʀ'' phoneme merged with ''r'' earlier. However, even if they render the transcription according to the local pronunciation, the [[Rundata]] project presents personal names according to the previously mentioned standardized spelling in English translations. Here follows an example from the [[Orkesta Runestones#U 344|Orkesta Runestone (U 344)]]:

Standardized spelling:
: ''{{lang|non|En Ulfr hefir á Englandi þrjú gjǫld tekit. Þat var fyrsta þat's Tosti ga[l]t. Þá [galt] Þorketill. Þá galt Knútr.}}''
The rendering of Old East Norse:
: ''{{lang|non|En Ulfʀ hafiʀ a Ænglandi þry giald takit. Þet vas fyrsta þet's Tosti ga[l]t. Þa [galt] Þorkætill. Þa galt Knutr.}}''
But when translating into English, the standardized spelling is used:
: ''But Ulfr has taken [[Danegeld|three payments in England]]. That was the first that [[Skagul Toste|Tosti]] paid. Then [[Thorkell the Tall|Þorketill]] paid. Then [[Cnut the Great|Knútr]] paid.''

== Modernized Icelandic spelling ==
In many modern [[Iceland]]ic publications of Old Norse works, the modern [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic spelling]] is used. The orthography is essentially the same, but changes from [[Old Norse phonology]] to Icelandic phonology are incorporated in the translation that may not have been in the source text. One such difference is the insertion of u before r, when it is preceded by a consonant at the end of the word. Thus the Old Norse name Baldr comes out as Baldur in modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. Other differences include vowel-shifts, whereby Old Norse ''ǫ'' became Icelandic ''ö'', and Old Norse ''œ'' became Icelandic ''æ''. Old Norse ''ø'' corresponds in modern Icelandic to ''ö'', as in ''sökkva'', or to ''e'', as in ''gera''). There is also consonant [[lenition]] of final ''k'' and ''t'' to ''g'' and ''ð'', e.g. ''mig'' for earlier ''mik'' and ''það'' for earlier ''þat''.  These distinct features are summarized in the table below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ON !! Icelandic
|-
| -r || -ur
|-
| -k || -g
|-
| -t || -ð
|-
| ǫ || ö
|-
| œ || æ
|-
| ø || ö, e
|}

== Anglicized spelling ==

For the convenience of [[English language|English]] writers and readers the Old Norse characters not used in English are commonly replaced with English ones. This can lead to ambiguity and confusion. Diacritics may be removed (á → a, ö → o). The following character conversions also take place:

* [[ø]] → o
* [[œ]] → o, oe
* [[æ]] → ae
* [[þ]] → th
* [[ð]] → th, d, dh

Another common convention in English is to drop [[consonant]] [[Old Norse morphology#Nouns|nominative endings]]:

* Egill → Egil
* [[Yggdrasill]] → Yggdrasil
* Gunnarr → Gunnar
* Sveinn → Svein
* [[Freyr]] → Frey
* [[Hildr]] → Hild

Sometimes a ''j'' is dropped after ''ey''.

* Freyja → Freya

Other quirks sometimes seen include adding a [[Latin declension#First declension (a)|Latin -a suffix]] to the names of goddesses.

* [[Frigg]] → Frigga
* [[Iðunn]] → Iduna

Obviously the various permutations allow for many possible spellings for a given name.

Some authors, for example, replace ''þ'' with ''th'' and ''ð'' with ''th'', ''dh'' or ''d'' but keep the accents; others may not replace ''ǫ'' with ''ö'' but prefer ''o''.

Thus, in addition to the various versions below, the name of ''[[Hǫðr]]'' could come out as:

* Hod, Hoðr, Hödhr, Hödr, Höd, Höð, Hoð, etcetera

[[File:One man band, CDV by Knox, c1865.JPG|thumb|One-man band; photo by Knox of [[Athol, Massachusetts]], circa 1865]]

A '''one-man band''' is a musician who plays a number of instruments simultaneously using their hands, feet, limbs, and various mechanical or electronic contraptions. One-man bands also often sing while they perform. 

The simplest type of "one-man band" is a singer [[accompaniment|accompanying]] themselves on [[acoustic guitar]] and playing a [[harmonica]] mounted in a metal "harp rack" below the mouth. This approach is often taken by [[busker]]s and [[folk music]] singer-guitarists. More complicated setups may include [[wind instrument]]s strapped around the neck, a large [[bass drum]] mounted on the musician's back with a beater which is connected to a foot pedal, [[cymbal]]s strapped between the knees or triggered by a pedal mechanism, [[tambourine]]s and [[maraca]]s tied to the limbs, and a stringed instrument strapped over the shoulders (e.g., a [[banjo]], [[ukulele]] or [[guitar]]). 

Since the development of [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) in the 1980s, musicians have also incorporated chest-mounted MIDI drum pads, foot-mounted [[electronic drum]] triggers, and electronic [[pedal keyboard]]s into their set-ups. In the 2000s and 2010s, the availability of affordable digital looping pedals has enabled singer-musicians to record a riff or chord progression and then solo or sing over it.

==History and meanings==
===Live instruments===
[[Image:Cantigastaborers.gif|thumb|[[Pipe and tabor]]ers, from the 13th-century [[illuminated manuscript]], [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]]]
The earliest known records of multiple musical instruments being played at the same time date from the 13th century, and were the pipe and [[Tabor (instrument)|tabor]]. The pipe was a simple three-holed [[flute]] that could be played with one hand; the tabor is more commonly known today as a [[snare drum]]. This type of playing can still be heard in parts of rural [[France]], in [[England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pipeandtabor.org|title=Pipe and Tabor - The home of The Taborers Society|author=|date=|website=Pipeandtabor.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spain]]. An [[Elizabethan]]-era woodcut shows a clown playing the pipe and tabor. An 1820s watercolour painting shows a one-man band with a rhythm-making stick, panpipes around his neck and a [[bass drum]] and tambourine beside him. [[Henry Mayhew]]'s history of London street life in the 1840s and 1850s described a blind street performer  who played bells, the violin and accordions.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Henry Mayhew, London Labor and the London Poor, ([[Dover Publications]], Inc., New York, 1968), Vol. 3, p. 161. Reprint of 1861-62 edition published by Griffin, Bohn and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guitarist [[Jim Garner (musician)|Jim Garner]] played guitar with his hands and triangle with his feet, and [[Will Blankenship]] of the Blankenship Family of North Carolina played harmonica, [[autoharp]] and triangle in shows during the 1930s. In the 1940s, entertainer and clown [[Benny Dougal]] used a crude "stump fiddle" (a single string stretched on a stick) with a footpedal-operated pair of cymbals. [[Blues]] singers such as "Daddy Stovepipe" (Johnny Watson) would sing, play guitar, and stomp their feet for rhythm, or used a foot pedal to play bass drum or cymbal.

One of the earliest modern exponents of multiple instruments was [[Jesse Fuller]]. Fuller developed a foot-operated bass instrument which he called the "[[footdella]]", which had six bass strings which were struck by hammers. In "one-man-band" shows, Fuller would use his "footdella", a footpedal-operated "sock" (bass drum), a homemade neck harness (for a harmonica, [[kazoo]] and microphone), and a [[12-string guitar]]. [[Fate Norris]], of the [[Skillet Lickers]], a hillbilly string band of the 1920s and early 1930s developed a geared mechanical contraption with footpedals that enabled him to play guitar, bells, [[bass fiddle]], [[fiddle]], autoharp and mouth harp.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Joe Barrick, who was born in Oklahoma in 1922, wanted a way of accompanying himself on fiddle, so he built a contraption with a guitar neck on a board with footpedals to operate the notes. Subsequent versions of this "piatar" also had bass guitar and banjo necks and a snare drum which are played by foot-operated hammers. To change notes on the guitar-family instruments, a foot treadle operates a mechanical fretting device. Two notable one-man [[blues]] bands active in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] in the 1950s were [[Doctor Ross]] and [[Joe Hill Louis]], playing guitar, harmonica and bass drum/[[Hi-hat (instrument)|high-hat]].
[[Image:Guitarist Liverpool Street.JPG|thumb|A musician in London performs on electric guitar and a small drum kit.]]
The simple [[guitar]] and [[harmonica]] combination (as used by such musicians as [[Tex Williams]], [[Anton Newcombe]], [[Jimmy Reed]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], and [[Ray Dorset]] of [[Mungo Jerry]]) is so common now that it is rarely considered to be a one-man band. British-born [[Don Partridge]] made the classic one-man band outfit (bass drum on the back, guitar and harmonica) famous in the streets of [[Europe]], and was an early busker to enter the [[Top 40|Top Ten]] of the [[UK Singles Chart]], with his [[chart hit|hit]] [[single (music)|singles]] "Rosie" and "Blue Eyes" in 1968. Modern one-man bands include such performers as Ben de la Garza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/bendelagarza|title=Ben de la Garza|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hasil Adkins]] and [[Sterling Magee]], better known as "Mister Satan," from [[Satan and Adam]]. 
[[Image:Onemanband.jpg|left|thumb|[[Vic Ellis]] of [[Sussex]]]]

:"The one-man band exists, in all its uniqueness and independence, as a most elusive yet persistent musical tradition. As a category of musicianship it transcends cultural and geographic boundaries, spans stylistic limits, and defies conventional notions of technique and instrumentation. Defined simply as a single musician playing more than one instrument at the same time, it is an ensemble limited only by the mechanical capabilities and imaginative inventiveness of its creator, and despite its generally accepted status as an isolated novelty, it is a phenomenon with some identifiable historical continuity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/barrick.htm|title=Joe Barrick's one-man band|author=Hal Rammel |date=1990|website=Mustrad.org.uk|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studio recording===
The term "one-man band" is also [[colloquialism|colloquially]] used to describe a performer who plays every instrument on a recorded song one at a time, and then mixes them together in a multitrack [[recording studio|studio]]. While this approach to recording is more common in electronica genres such as [[techno]] and [[acid house]] than traditional rock music, some rock performers such as [[Joe Hill Louis]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Kabir Suman]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[John Fogerty]], [[Emitt Rhodes]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Roy Wood]], [[Nik Kershaw]], and [[Les Fradkin]] have made records in which they play every instrument (one after the other). [[Mike Oldfield]] was noted for using this recording technique during the recording of his 1973 album ''[[Tubular Bells]]''. Other examples of a one-man band in the recording studio are [[Dave Grohl]] for the first studio album by the [[Foo Fighters]], [[Trent Reznor]] for [[Nine Inch Nails]], jazz piano player [[Keith Jarrett]] for his album ''[[No End (album)|No End]]'', [[Peter Tagtgren]] for [[Pain (musical project)]], [[Chris Carrabba]] for the first two albums released by [[Dashboard Confessional]], [[Varg Vikernes]] for [[Burzum]] and [[Billy Corgan]] for [[Smashing Pumpkins]] since 2009.

[[Nash the Slash]] (1948-2014) played all instruments on his recordings. He also played solo concerts from 1975 to 2012, using synchronized [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s as he plays either an [[electric violin]] or [[electric mandolin]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Some artists record and mixed their music in a multitrack studio and synchronize it with video multitrack video playing on all instruments, creating a one-man band illusion.

One-man bands in this context have become more common in [[extreme metal]], especially [[black metal]], where a number of bands apart from Burzum consist of only one member. Such artists include [[Nargaroth]], [[Xasthur]], [[Falkenbach]], [[Arckanum]], [[Nortt]], [[Horde (band)|Horde]], and others. While most of these bands do not play live, some such as [[Nargaroth]] hire additional musicians for live performances.

"One-woman band" is not used very often in the vernacular, but women have increasingly had a presence as musicians in most forms of music.  Examples of one-woman bands are [[Merrill Garbus]], who performs as [[Tune-Yards]] and plays every instrument on all recordings {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}, and [[Edith Crash]]  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coachellavalleyweekly.com/joshua-tree-music-festival-2017-higher-purpose-in-the-high-desert/ |title=Joshua Tree Music Festival 2017 – Higher Purpose in the High Desert|website=Coachellavalleyweekly.com|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who creates "dark and haunting, drawn-out melodies"&lt;ref&gt;[http://laist.com/2016/08/18/echo_park_rising_2016.php Your Guide To The 2016 Echo Park Rising Festival&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105171548/http://laist.com/2016/08/18/echo_park_rising_2016.php |date=2017-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;!-- Notice to all one-man bands and supporters of one-man bands. Adding you or your friends to this list does not make you cool. When you meet the Biography and Discography standards of Wikipedia regarding notability (e.g., there is an article about your band in a newspaper or magazine or a review of your recording or DVD in a magazine), you can be part of the definition of the word. Until then keep practicing and try to keep the band together! : ) --&gt;

===Live looping===
[[File:Chris Lejeune - One-Man-Band.jpg|thumbnail|Chris Lejeune 2007]]
{{Main|Live looping}}
In the 2000s, as digital looping pedals became widely available, performers have been able to use a mixture of previously recorded music, delay effects, and looping devices in live performances of everything from [[beatboxing]] to classical violin. Live looping performers create layered looped accompaniment for musical solos that are sung or played later in the song.  Using this technology, a simultaneous combination of various instruments and vocals, or one instrument played in different ways, can be created over the course of one musical piece which rivals the sounds of studio recording. Notable artists who incorporate this technique live include [[Ed Sheeran]], [[Keller Williams]], [[That 1 Guy]], [[Zach Deputy]], and [[KT Tunstall]].  Rick Walker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looppool.info/bio.html|title=Loop.pooL: Rick Walker's musical biography|author=|date=|website=Looppool.info|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another looper and multi-instrumentalist who has organized looping festivals, including a long-running annual one in Santa Cruz, California, and others in various countries.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Developments==
[[File:ClarkeAndTheHimselfs.jpg|thumb|Clarke and the Himselfs&lt;ref&gt;[http://treefortmusicfest.com/lineup/67|title=treefortmusicfest.com/lineup/67] {{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; performing with mixed technology in [[Boise, Idaho]] in late 2013]]
Since the development of Musical Instrument Digital Interface ([[MIDI]]) in the 1980s, musicians have also incorporated chest-mounted [[MIDI]] drum pads, foot-mounted electronic drum triggers. Some "one-man bands" use organ-style [[pedal keyboard]]s to perform [[bassline]]s. A small number of MIDI enthusiasts use custom-made MIDI controllers connected to different parts of their bodies to trigger music on synthesizers. Custom-made MIDI controllers range from wind-operated controllers to small triggers mounted on the arms or feet. At a certain point, the use of body MIDI controllers may come to resemble [[performance art]], because the musical sounds are triggered by the performer assuming certain poses or dancing. One of the pioneers of this performance art is McRorie Live Electronic, who uses drum sensors on his shoes, tom sensors on his chest, separate rhythm and bass keyboards and vocal lead instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgbUsJCfDf4|title=McPromo||date=23 October 2014|accessdate=18 April 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the use of 2000s-era digital [[loop pedal]]s, which can record and then repeat a short musical phrase, performers can play a [[riff]] or [[groove (music)|groove]] and then solo over the repeated loop. An example of this technique is by Canadian musician Jay Robinson who creates full band arrangements live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/jasonr123guitar|title=Jay Robinson|author=|date=|website=YouTube|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Dan the One man band Calgary.jpg|thumb|A one-man band [[busking]] in Calgary, Alberta]]

With the rise in availability and affordability of electronic devices came innovation with the traditional acoustic "one-man band" instruments. One example is the Farmer Musical Instrument Co! based in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://footdrums.com|title=Farmer Foot Drums|author=|date=|website=Farmer Foot Drums|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Farmer sells acoustic foot-played percussion instruments that allow musicians to play a range of traditional drum kit sounds, the [[foot drum]] Deluxe, or tambourine and shaker pedals for tapping out simple beats. With the development of technology and prominence of video sharing sites like [[YouTube]], musicians are now able to record each instrument individually and then compile a video as if it were all done in real time.

==Non-musical meanings==
The term is also used in a general sense to refer to a person who runs a [[small business]] alone (a sole-proprietorship business), particularly if the operation requires that person to assume multiple different roles, in a manner akin to the way a musical "one-man band" performer plays different instruments and sings at the same time. In some small businesses, the owner also produces the product or service, markets it and delivers it to clients. In TV news, the phrase refers to a reporter who also functions as her own cameraperson via the use of a tripod.

In 2011, professional wrestler [[Heath Slater]] climbed to fame with the nickname "The One-Man Rock Band", which was later changed to "The One-Man Southern Rock Band" in reference to him being billed from [[West Virginia]].

'''''Orbiz''''' is a [[top-down shooter]] [[hack and slash]] [[roguelike]] [[video game]] by Anoman Studio. Early prototypes of the game were distributed through [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s early access program in 2017. The primary objective of the game is to engage in three levels of combat with various zombies on each spherical world before locating the portal to travel to the next one.

== Gameplay ==
''Orbiz'' is a [[top-down shooter]] game with [[roguelike]] elements, designed for both singleplayer and local multiplayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://haogamers.com/battle-zombies-on-a-tiny-planet-with-friends-in-orbiz-bf89c7e58664#.p3c8ssmy1|title=Battle Zombies on a Tiny Planet with Friends in Orbiz|publisher=HaoGamers.com|date=2016-06-06|accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This game begins with spherical worlds which contains unlimited zombies and player must have destroyed the green spawners for stopping the unlimited zombie spawning. Player can choose one character from 4 different characters. Each character would have their own special ability in game. The primary objective of the game is to engage in three levels of combat with various zombies on each spherical world before locating the portal to travel to the next one. You can run or kill the zombies, or effectively you must destroy all of the green glowing spawners dotted throughout the landscape, to open the portal to the next world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2016/04/07/orbiz-grab-friend-shoot-undead-rotating-spherical-planets/|title=Orbiz – Grab A Friend &amp; Shoot Undead On Rotating Spherical Planets|publisher=Siliconera.com|date=2016-04-07|accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Anoman Studio formed around November 2014 when they decided to try out making their first game together. They have publicly shown their game demo for the first time in December 2014 at UMN ProtoWar in Jakarta and then got 1st Prize for Best Game Prototype. After that, they submitted the playable demo to IN.GAME in August 2015 and also demonstrated at Game Developer Gathering 2015 in [[Bandung]], [[Indonesia]]. We polished the demo even more and added some new features so that we could upload it to GAME JOLT in October and also released it publicly available for download to get valuable feedback. On the seconds quarter of 2016, Orbiz has been selected by a Square Enix Indie program called Square Enix Collective. However, it couldn't be realized and supported by its program after gain and win the yes vote because of the lack enthusiasm of square enix player community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamingcypher.com/square-enix-collective-needs-votes-4-new-indie-projects/|title=Square Enix Collective Needs Your Votes on 4 New Indie Projects|publisher=GamingCypher.com|date=2016-04-05|accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eu.square-enix.com/en/node/6735|title=ORBIZ smashes onto Collective!|publisher=Eu.square-enix.com|date=2016-03-21|accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Reception ==
''Orbiz'' has received best upcoming indie hack and slash game from INDIE DB on 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiedb.com/groups/2015-indie-of-the-year-awards/top100|title=Top 100 of 2015|publisher=IndieDB.com|date=2015-12-31|accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Ornament and Crime'''" is an essay and lecture by modernist architect [[Adolf Loos]] that criticizes [[ornament (art)|ornament]] in useful objects.

==History==
Contrary to popular belief that it was composed in 1908, Adolf Loos first gave the lecture in 1910 at the Akademischer Verband für Literatur und Musik in Vienna. The essay was then published in 1913 in ''Les Cahiers d’aujourd’hui'' in French as "Ornement et Crime". Only in 1929 was the essay published in German in the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'', as "Ornament und Verbrechen". It was the architect [[Henry Kulka]], who assisted Loos during a reprint of the essay in 1931 in ''Trotzdem'', that altered the original year to 1908 after he consulted Loos, who either didn't remember well or wanted to assume primacy in the confrontation against the [[Secession (art)|Secessionists]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Long, [http://apps.acsa-arch.org/resources/proceedings/uploads/streamfile.aspx?path=ACSA.AM.85&amp;name=ACSA.AM.85.107.pdf “Ornament, Crime, Myth, and Meaning”], ''85th ACSA Annual Meeting Proceedings, Architecture: Material and Imagined'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The essay was written when [[Art Nouveau]]—known as [[Vienna Secession|Secession]] in Austria and which Loos had excoriated even at its height in 1900—was showing a new way forward for modern art. The essay is important in articulating some moralizing views, inherited from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], which would be fundamental to the [[Bauhaus]] design studio, and would help define the ideology of [[Modern architecture|modernism in architecture]].

"The evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects," Loos proclaimed, thus linking the optimistic sense of the linear and upward progress of cultures with the contemporary vogue for applying [[evolution]] to cultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Jimena Canales, Andrew Herscher, [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hsdept/bios/docs/canales-Criminal%20Skins.pdf "Criminal Skins: Tattoos and Modern Architecture in the Work of Adolf Loos"], ''Architectural History'' 48, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Loos's work was prompted by regulations he encountered when he designed a tailorshop without ornamentation next to a palace. He eventually conceded to requirements by adding a flowerpot.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |last=Wise|first=Michael |date=4 December 2013 |title=Reassessing an Uproar in Architecture |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/garden/reassessing-an-uproar-in-architecture.html?_r=0 |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York |access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay, Loos explains his philosophy, describing how ornamentation can have the effect of causing objects to go out of style and thus become obsolete. It struck him that it was a crime to waste the effort needed to add ornamentation, when the ornamentation would cause the object to soon go out of style. Loos introduced a sense of the "immorality" of ornament, describing it as "degenerate", its suppression as necessary for regulating modern society. He took as one of his examples the [[tattoo]]ing of the "[[Papuan peoples|Papuan]]" and the intense surface decorations of the objects about him—Loos says that, in the eyes of western culture, the Papuan has not evolved to the moral and civilized circumstances of modern man, who, should he tattoo himself, would either be considered a criminal or a degenerate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adolf Loos|year=1908|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf|title=Ornament and Crime|location=Innsbruck, reprint Vienna, 1930|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403175309/http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rawson&gt;{{cite book | last = Rawson | first = Jessica | |authorlink= Jessica Rawson |title = Chinese ornament: the lotus and the dragon | publisher = British Museum Publications | location = London | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-7141-1431-6 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loos never argued for the complete absence of ornamentation, but believed that it had to be appropriate to the type of material.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Loos concluded that "No ornament can any longer be made today by anyone who lives on our cultural level ... Freedom from ornament is a sign of spiritual strength".&lt;ref name=rawson/&gt;

'''Pahari''', or '''Pahadi''' ({{lang|hi|पहाड़ी}} {{lang|inc|pahāṛī}} 'of the hills/mountains'; {{IPAc-en|lang|p|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|r|i}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|Pahari}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ambiguous term that has been used for a variety of languages, dialects and language groups, most of which are found in the lower Himalayas.

Most commonly, it refers to:
* [[Pahari-Pothwari]], the predominant language of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and neighbouring areas of Punjab and Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir
* individual [[Himachali languages]], spoken in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh&lt;ref name="Masica1991"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Masica| first = Colin P.|author-link = Colin Masica| title = The Indo-Aryan languages| series = Cambridge language surveys| date = 1991| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-23420-7| page = 439| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Northern Indo-Aryan languages]], in the linguistics literature often referred to as "Pahari languages", a controversial group that includes the Indo-Aryan languages of Nepal and the Indian states of [[Uttarakhand]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]].

Less commonly, ''Pahari'' may be:

"'''''Pensée unique'''''" ([[French language|French]] for "single thought") is a pejorative expression for [[mainstream]] [[ideology|ideological]] [[conformism]] of any kind, almost always opposed to that of the speaker. Originally, it is a French expression and referred to claims that [[neoliberalism]] is the only correct way to structure society. The phrase implies that mainstream discussion is limited by ideological assumptions of what is possible. One example of ''pensée unique'' given by critics was the motto of [[Margaret Thatcher]] (former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]): [[There is no alternative|TINA]] ("There is no alternative").

The expression was coined by [[Jean-François Kahn]], editor-in-chief of L'Événement du Jeudi,&lt;ref&gt;Jean-François Kahn, Les Risques de la pensée unique. L'Événement du Jeudi, 30th January 1992, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; in an editorial in January 1992. The phrase pensée unique is often used by political parties and organisations and in criticism.

The term has been used regarding [[prohibitionism]] of marijuana, with some commenters saying that ''pensée unique'' is a barrier to legalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/onu-condena-uruguay-violar-convenios.html ''ONU condena a Uruguay por violar convenios con la marihuana legal''] quotation: {{quotation|"Este es un tema que por primera vez rompe el pensamiento único. Acá se cayó otro muro, el muro del pensamiento único. Las convenciones no son una Biblia, son convenciones y no es el pensamiento único", afirmó Romani.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

== Animal personality vs. human personality ==
The extent of personality phenomenon considered when examining animal personality is significantly reduced compared to those studied in humans. Concepts such as personal objects, identity, attitudes and life stories are not considered relevant in animals. Similarly, any approach that requires the subject to explain motives, beliefs or feelings is not applicable to the study of animal behaviour.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The study of animal personality is largely based on the observation and investigation of behavioural traits. In an ecological context, traits or ‘characters’ are attributes of an organism that are shared by members of a species. Traits can be shared by all or only a portion of individuals in a population. For example, studies in animal personality often examine traits such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty, boldness, exploration and sociality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Background==
The initial framework used to study animal personality was [[comparative psychology]]. The descriptive language used by comparative psychologists in the late nineteenth century often attributed disposition and behavioural tendencies to individual animals in their studies. Many of these reports are the result of researchers anthropomorphizing the animal subjects and did not explicitly examine what is now considered animal personality. However, these studies do represent the some of the first instances of scientists reporting individual differences in animal behaviour.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-59300-5_1|title=Personality in Nonhuman Animals|last=Whitham|first=Will|last2=Washburn|first2=David A.|date=2017|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=9783319592992|pages=3–16|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-59300-5_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian physiologist, [[Ivan Pavlov]], was one of the first researchers to integrate personality into his research of animal behaviour. In his seminal studies on conditional reflexes, he categorized the behaviour of dogs as Excitable, Lively, Quiet or Inhibited. He linked these personalities to learning ability. The Excitable type, for example, showed signs of strong excitatory conditioning, but a limited ability for the acquisition of inhibitory connections. The Lively type was the most balanced and displayed rapid [[associative learning]], while the Quiet type exhibited consistent but slow learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carere|first=Claudio|last2=Locurto|first2=Charles|date=2011-08-01|title=Interaction between animal personality and animal cognition|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/czoolo/57.4.491|journal=Current Zoology|language=en|volume=57|issue=4|pages=491–498|doi=10.1093/czoolo/57.4.491|issn=1674-5507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first study that empirically examined animal personality was in 1938, Meredith Crawford quantified individual differences in the behaviour of young chimpanzee using a behaviour rating scale. Crawford conducted his research out of the Yale Laboratories of Primate Biology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since then, psychologists have continued to investigate personality in animals across a wide range of taxa. Meanwhile, the incorporation of animal personality into the fields of ecology and evolution is a relatively new practice. Ecologist began to recognize the importance of individual differences in behaviour near the end of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Sih 372–378"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sih|first=Andrew|last2=Bell|first2=Alison|last3=Johnson|first3=J.Chadwick|title=Behavioral syndromes: an ecological and evolutionary overview|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534704001211|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=19|issue=7|pages=372–378|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Methods==

=== Rating of traits ===
Rating traits involve a group of observers that scrutinize the behavioural traits of an individual animal. Observers are typically given a list of characters and/or descriptions to use as a reference for interpreting animal behaviour then use the list to rate the behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Highfill|first=Lauren|last2=Hanbury|first2=David|last3=Kristiansen|first3=Rachel|last4=Kuczaj|first4=Stan|last5=Watson|first5=Sheree|date=2010-07-01|title=Rating vs. coding in animal personality research|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/zoo.20279|journal=Zoo Biology|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1002/zoo.20279|issn=1098-2361}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rating method uses observers and data recording instruments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Coding behaviours ===
Researchers will observe how individual animals respond to behavioural tests and code their reactions. This method is typically used in experimental studies in which environmental conditions are heavily manipulated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Behavioural reaction norms ===
As research in animal personality became more prevalent in ecological studies many behavioural ecologists were substituting [[Behavioral plasticity|behavioural plasticity]] for animal personality.&lt;ref name="Sih 372–378"/&gt; That is, attributing variation in behaviour to diverse personality types rather than plasticity in a single behavioural trait. Thus, behavioural reaction norms were introduced as a means of incorporating personality and individual plasticity in the study of animal behaviour. Behavioural reaction norms measure the behaviour of an individual over an environmental gradient, therefore providing information on how an animal behaves on average and how their behaviour changes across an environmental gradient.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dingemanse|first=Niels J.|last2=Kazem|first2=Anahita J.N.|last3=Réale|first3=Denis|last4=Wright|first4=Jonathan|title=Behavioural reaction norms: animal personality meets individual plasticity|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534709002432|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=25|issue=2|pages=81–89|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2009.07.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repeatability ===
Repeatability refers to the fraction of variation in a population that is owed to differences between individuals. Repeatability estimates are one of the most widely used statistical tools that can quantify consistent individual differences in behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biro|first=Peter A.|last2=Stamps|first2=Judy A.|title=Using repeatability to study physiological and behavioural traits: ignore time-related change at your peril|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.04.008|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=105|pages=223–230|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formally,&lt;math display="block"&gt;r = \left ( \frac{S_A ^2}{S_A ^2 + S^2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;Where, &lt;math&gt;S_A^2

&lt;/math&gt;  is variance among individuals and &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; is the variance within individuals over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leclerc|first=Martin|last2=Wal|first2=Eric Vander|last3=Zedrosser|first3=Andreas|last4=Swenson|first4=Jon E.|last5=Kindberg|first5=Jonas|last6=Pelletier|first6=Fanie|date=2016-03-01|title=Quantifying consistent individual differences in habitat selection|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-015-3500-6|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=180|issue=3|pages=697–705|doi=10.1007/s00442-015-3500-6|issn=0029-8549}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a meta-analysis of published, peer-reviewed repeatability estimates, reviewers found that, in general, approximately 35% of behavioural variation among individuals could be attributed to individuals differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Alison M.|last2=Hankison|first2=Shala J.|last3=Laskowski|first3=Kate L.|title=The repeatability of behaviour: a meta-analysis|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347209000189|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=77|issue=4|pages=771–783|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.12.022|pmc=3972767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five Factor Model==
'''The [[Five Factor Model]]''', or the Big Five personality trait model, has been used to assign personality archetypes to some animals.&lt;ref name="Gosling2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gosling|first=Samuel|title=Personality in Non-human Animals|year=2008|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/edd7/67e222a19ef713c83dd0fded4183c3cd0893.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5 categories for the five factor model for personality are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Each of these categories identifies personality factors at the broadest level of abstraction. Because the assessment of personality using the five factor model is often a self-reported measure for humans, applying this model to animals can be difficult to standardize. Researchers often measure personality by assessing the behavior of the being over a period of time to establish the pattern. Naturally, some animals may not have as wide a range of personality as humans do. The species of the animal determines how the personality manifests itself. Likewise, a species may be predisposed to exhibit a category of personality more than other categories. So far, [[chimpanzee]]s are the only animal shown to exhibit conscientiousness.&lt;ref name="Gosling1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gosling|first=Samuel|author2=John P. Oliver|title=Personality Dimensions in Non-human Animals: A Cross-Species Review|year=1999|url=https://gosling.psy.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CDPS99Xspeciesreview.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimpanzees are also the only non-human species shown to demonstrate a hierarchical structure of personality, with two dimensions of affect corresponding to negative and positive emotionality, and a third dimension of disinhibition (vs. constraint), which is thought to comprise a regulatory system that is known to play a role in the perception and interpretation of incoming stimuli.{{clarify|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latzman, Hopkins, Keebaugh and Young|first=Robert, William, Alaine and Larry|date=21 April 2014|title=Personality in Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): Exploring the Hierarchical Structure and Associations with the Vasopressin V1A Receptor Gene|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3994157/pdf/pone.0095741.pdf|journal=Plus One|volume=9|pages=1-12|via=Open Access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuroticism, agreeableness and extraversion are the most commonly found personality traits among measured animals. For example, chimpanzees show emotional stability, agreeableness and surgency,&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=King, J.E.  |author2=Figueredo, A.J. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1997|title=The Five-Factor Model plus dominance in chimpanzee personality|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=31|pages=257–271 |doi=10.1006/jrpe.1997.2179}}&lt;/ref&gt; audiovisual reactivity, affect-extraversion,&lt;ref name="Bard"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bard, K.A.  |author2=Gardner, K.H. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1996|chapter=Influences on development in infant chimpanzees: Enculturation, temperament, and cognition|editor1=A.E.

Vine |title=Social Communication and Movement: Studies of Interaction and Expression in Man and Chimpanzee|pages=75–162|publisher=Academic Press, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Correlated traits and behaviours ==

Some behaviours are correlated into a set of personality traits that remain constant throughout different situations and contexts. These traits are referred to as [[Behavioral syndrome|behavioural syndromes]]. For example, the aggressiveness-boldness syndrome refers to the correlation between an individuals aggressiveness with conspecifics and boldness in novel environments.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Many correlated behaviours are species specific. For instance, a study in 2014 reported that for horses, personality (quantified using a validated [[questionnaire]]) and tolerance to pain (using a [[Likert scale]]) indicated that neuroticism is negatively related to stoicism whereas extroversion was positively related to levels of expressed lameness.  This suggests that pain may be more easily identified in highly extrovert horses.&lt;ref name="Ijichi"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ijichi, C., Collins, L. M. and Elwood, R.W.|year=2014|title=Pain expression is linked to personality in horses|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=152|pages=38–43|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2013.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[zebrafish]] (''Danio rerio''), Proactive and Reactive personalities express different thermal preferences and general activity within the temperature gradient. Proactive fish (more aggressive, bold risk-takers, prone to routine formation) have a preference for higher temperature environments. Reactive fish (shy, less risk-prone, more flexible) favor medium colder temperatures.&lt;ref name="Rey"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rey, S., Digka, N. and MacKenzie, S.|year=2015|title=Animal personality relates to thermal preference in wild-type zebrafish, Danio rerio|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon_Mackenzie/publication/274090607_Animal_Personality_Relates_to_Thermal_Preference_in_Wild-Type_Zebrafish_Danio_rerio/links/551d51ad0cf29a69c99b287c.pdf|journal=Zebrafish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary potential  ==
The degree of variation in a population has been determined to influence to direction and outcome of natural selection. Most scientific research has focused on genetic and phenotypic variation or differences in resource use; however, variation in consistent behaviours (i.e. personality) also has important evolutionary consequences. For example, personality in animals can affect the way individuals interact with their environment and with each other which can affect the relative fitness of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biro|first=Peter A.|last2=Stamps|first2=Judy A.|title=Are animal personality traits linked to life-history productivity?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534708001596|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=23|issue=7|pages=361–368|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, personality can influence selection. Also, behavioural traits are more dynamic which may allow an animal to adapt more quickly which, in turn, can speed up the rate of evolution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further, [[Natural selection|natural]] or [[artificial selection]] cannot act on personality unless there is a mechanism for its inheritance. In [[rhesus macaques]] (''Maccaca mulatta''), the personality traits of Meek, Bold, Aggressive, Passive, Loner and Nervous have heritability values of 0.14 to 0.35, thus indicated that there is some genetic basis to the expression of personality traits in animals.  In [[Hominidae|apes, including humans]], heritability estimates of personality dimensions range from 0.07 to 0.63.&lt;ref name="Brent"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brent, L.J., Semple, S., MacLarnon, A., Ruiz-Lambides, A., Gonzalez-Martinez, J. and Platt, M.L.|year=2014|title=Personality traits in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are heritable but do not predict reproductive output|journal=International Journal of Primatology|volume=35|issue=1|pages=188–209|doi=10.1007/s10764-013-9724-6|pmc=3960078}}&lt;/ref&gt; In horses, [[heritability]] estimates range mostly between h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.15 and h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.40 for traits assessed in personality tests.  Values at this level are considered as "promising" for [[artificial selection]].&lt;ref name="Borstel"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Borstel, U.K.V.|year=2013|title=Assessing and influencing personality for improvement of animal welfare: A review of equine studies|journal=CAB Reviews|volume=8|issue=6|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Personality in animals has been studied across a wide array of taxa. Some of these studies have investigated personality in mammals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eggeman|first=Scott L.|last2=Hebblewhite|first2=Mark|last3=Bohm|first3=Holger|last4=Whittington|first4=Jesse|last5=Merrill|first5=Evelyn H.|date=2016-05-01|title=Behavioural flexibility in migratory behaviour in a long-lived large herbivore|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/1365-2656.12495|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|language=en|volume=85|issue=3|pages=785–797|doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12495|issn=1365-2656}}&lt;/ref&gt; elasmobranchs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-59300-5_7|title=Personality in Nonhuman Animals|last=Finger|first=J.

More specifically, there have been several studies that have either been notable in that they have changed scientific understandings of animal personality or have applications in the field of human personality. For example, the study of personality in chimpanzees by King and Figueredo in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=James E.|last2=Figueredo|first2=Aurelio José|title=The Five-Factor Model plus Dominance in Chimpanzee Personality|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092656697921796|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=31|issue=2|pages=257–271|doi=10.1006/jrpe.1997.2179}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first studies to apply the five-factor model in animal personality. It demonstrated the existence of personality traits in animals and provided a foundation for similar assessment strategies in future studies of personality in animals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, [[zebrafish]] have been used as a neurobehavioral model species for studying personality using the trait approach in non-human animals. These studies can then be translated to study personality development and personality disorders in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-59300-5_6|title=Personality in Nonhuman Animals|last=Khan|first=Kanza M.|last2=Echevarria|first2=David J.|date=2017|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=9783319592992|pages=111–127|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-59300-5_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another general example is the spider, ''[[Anelosimus studiosus]].'' This spider forms groups in which some females show an aggressive personality type and engage more in colony defence and prey capture, while others are docile and engage more in brood care. Groups containing both these two different personalities have better fitness than groups of only one personality type.  This is because aggressive females are more efficient at foraging, web construction and defence, while docile females are better at raising the young. When groups contain a mix of both personalities, overall group performance is improved benefiting all group members.&lt;ref name="Grinsted"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Grinsted, L.  |author2=Bacon, J.P. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2014|title=Animal behaviour: Task differentiation by personality in spider groups|journal=Current Biology|volume=24|issue=16|pages=R749-R751|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214008343 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.07.008 |pmid=25137587}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the social spider ''Stegodyphus dumicola'' individuals differ in their boldness, with bolder individuals having a greater risk appetite. Boldness changes were found to relate to social interactions with nest mates, indicating that individual personality is more plastic in groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hunt, ER. |title= Social interactions shape individual and collective personality in social spiders |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B |year= 2018 |volume= 285 |issue= 1886 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2018.1366|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many researchers are critical of the lack of consistency in the terminology surrounding animal personality. For example, temperament, behavioural syndrome, disposition and animal personality have been used interchangeably by some while others maintain that each term has a unique meaning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, there is some concern that researchers may be misinterpreting the relationship between personality and behavioural plasticity. The behavioural ecologist, Dr. Niels Dingemanse, illustrates that one could erroneously determine that variation in behaviour between individuals exists if the subjects have not been examined across a gradient of ecological contexts and urges fellow researchers to apply behavioural reaction norms whenever possible.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In addition, because of [[critical anthropomorphism]], [[ethology]], and [[comparative psychology]] are relatively unknown concepts to the layman, there are critics that question the validity in the claim that animals have a personality schema. There are those that fear that, while assessing behaviors, researchers will project anthropomorphic ratings onto the animals.&lt;ref name="Gosling1999" /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Re:Creators'''''|レクリエイターズ|Re:Kurieitāzu|stylized as ''Re:CREATORS''|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[anime]] television series produced by [[Troyca]]. The series is about a high school student who becomes involved in a battle between several characters from manga, anime, and video games who somehow appear in the real world. It aired from April 8 to September 16, 2017, and was exclusively streamed by [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] on their [[Amazon Video]] service. A [[manga]] adaptation by Daiki Kase was announced on February 18, 2017.

==Plot==
Sōta Mizushino is a young high school student and anime fan who dreams of writing his own [[light novel]]. While watching the anime adaptation of the [[Mecha anime and manga|mecha]] light novel ''Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier'' to look for inspiration, the [[tablet computer]] he is watching it on sputters and drags him into the anime's world, where he witnesses a battle between the anime's character Selesia and a mysterious girl wearing a military uniform. After returning with Selesia, Sōta discovers that other characters from different stories and forms of media were also brought to the real world, with some of them aligned with the military uniform princess, who promised them the ways to end the strife in their worlds and a way back home, unaware of her true intentions. To stop her, Sōta and Selesia agree to find the other characters and bring them home; lest the military uniform princess will bring untold destruction to every world that exists.

:A 16-year old high school student who likes to draw, but suffers from artists block. He was once friends with Altair's creator, Setsuna. However, he grew jealous of her because of how everyone liked her drawings while his mostly went ignored. As a result of this, he brushed her off when she was accused of plagiarism. However, after learning that she committed suicide, he was left traumatized with self-loathing. As a result, upon learning Altair's true identity, he initially kept this a secret from the others, unable to face his demons. However, he eventually pulls through and resolves to stop Altair to atone for his actions. Following the final battle, he begins moving on and once again starts drawing, having learned that his own approval is all that matters.

:A mysterious young girl who brought the other creations into the real world. While she claimed to do this to force their creators to alter their worlds, she wants to destroy the real world out of spite over the death of her own creator. It is eventually revealed that she originated from the music video ''Altair: World Étude'' created by Sōta's deceased friend, Setsuna. Being a creation without a story, she is able to adopt powers from fan-fictions about her; she calls this ability "Holopsicon". However, overusing these abilities will cause her to fade from the real world, though she can bypass this by getting her viewers' approval. She nearly succeeded in her goal, until she was confronted by a creation of Setsuna who convinces her to stop. Instead, she created a new world where the two of them can be together for eternity.

:The late creator of the online video called ''Altair: World Étude'', from which Altair originated. She and Sōta were friends until they drifted apart once she became a popular artist. However, her popularity caused those jealous of her success to accuse her of plagiarism, causing her to commit suicide prior to the start of the series. Her death sets the events of the series into motion, causing Altair's hatred towards humanity and leaving Sōta traumatized.

===Creations===
{{nihongo|Creations|被造物|Hizōbutsu}} are fictional characters that are taken out from various forms of 2D entertainment such as anime, manga, light novels, and video games by the "Military Uniform Princess". Much like in their respective worlds, they are able to use their own powers, making them unbalanced with normal humans in the real world. Characters that can be taken out are those who receive approval and 'enough' popularity from their readers and viewers.

 |ShortSummary    = Alicetaria, still believing Meteora to be responsible for Mamika's death, fights against her while Magane holds off Yūya. During their battle, Magane manages to gain control of Yūya's Astral Double, Hangaku. Meanwhile, as Alicetaria overpowers Meteora, Sōta tries to stop her by telling her how much he loves her story, but this doesn't persuade her. Selesia then arrives with Takashi, Masaaki and the military and fights Alicetaria. However, Altair then appears with Blitz and uses her power to destroying Selesia's sword, causing her to be critically injured by Alicetaria's spear. Takashi, desperate to save Selesia, uploads the illustration of her using flame magic to his social media. The overwhelming response from the fans grants the real Selesia the ability to use flame magic, allowing her to fight back against Alicetaria. As Altair and the others are forced to retreat after she starts to fade away from overusing her powers, Selesia returns to her wounded state.

 |ShortSummary    = As Selesia and Meteora recover, Sōta still feels himself responsible for what happened, when Rui appears and takes him for a ride on Gigas Makina to cheer him up. After returning to the others, Sōta reveals that he knew Setsuna, whose real name was Yuna Shimazaki, and blames himself for her death. Sota explains how he and Yuna met through an [[image board]] and became close friends since then. As time passed, however, Sota began to grow jealous of Yuna as her work became more popular while his own drawings didn't get much attention. When Yuna became falsely accused of [[plagiarism]], Sōta refrained from helping her, not only out of fear that he could make things worse, but because somehow deep inside him, he felt himself satisfied with her predicament.

 |ShortSummary    = After Sota refrained himself from giving her any real support in her time of need, Yuna sent him one final message containing the ''Altair: World Étude'' video that Altair first appears in. Later learning that Yuna had committed suicide shortly afterwards, Sota deleted all messages and media relating to her to try and forget about her. Given encouragement by Meteora, Sota assumes responsibility for his actions and resolves to stop Altair. Meanwhile, Alicetaria, remembering what Sota said about her story, decides to release her imprisoned creator, Gai Takarada, after hearing his motivation for creating the story. Resuming their planning, Sota and the others learn that Altair has the power to use almost unlimited abilities depicted in derivative fan works, but will be rejected by the world if she overuses them. Seeing that as their chance, Meteora proposes a plan in which the creators write side stories of their characters leading to the creation of a crossover world where they can trap Altair. Elsewhere, Altair and Blitz continue with their plan and are joined by Charon, the male lead of ''Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier''.

 |ShortSummary    = Kikuchihara gathers together the staff behind each series at [[International Stadium Yokohama|Nissan Stadium]] to inform them of the planned multimedia crossover project, ''Elimination Chamber Festival'', which will culminate in an anime special titled ''Border World Colliseum'' that will lure out Altair. Since simply making Altair weaker in the story would not have any effect, Kikuchihara emphasises to the staff that they must try to make their respective characters stronger than Altair while still gaining acceptance from their audience. As the project is announced and production begins on the spin-off works, the creators struggle to work with each other due to their conflicting worldviews and opinions. Meanwhile, Marine explains to Sota that even though she feels down when comparing herself to the other artists, recognising her faults and improving upon them is part of the fun. As tension between the creators calms down as they manage to work out compromises, Sota, wanting to get involved as well, asks Matsubara to let him create his own original character for the story. Elsewhere, Selesia and Rui come across another Creation, Hikayu Hoshikawa from the dating sim ''The Milky Way of a Starry Sky''.

The next day, Takarada, along with ''Milky Way''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; writer Nishio Ōnishi, join the other creators to discuss how to improve Alicetaria and Hikayu's abilities. Meanwhile, Altair speaks with Blitz about her awareness of the other team's plan, asking him not to participate in the final battle.

As thousands of fans are assembled at Nissan Stadium for the festival, Meteora activates a new spell that works similar to Altair's abilities to create a copy of Tokyo for the creations to fight in, along with thousands of cameras to record it and make it seem like a normal anime. She also brings Celesia's mech, Vogelchevalier, into the real world for her to use and enchants Yūya's bokken with an ice spell to increase its power. Meanwhile, Altair's group prepares to move out.

Altair's group confronts Sōta's and fighting ensues; Selesia fights Altair while Alicetelia holds off Rui and Shō confronts Yūya. Meanwhile, Sōta is confronted by Magane while watching the fight from Nissan Stadium. Altair easily blocks all of Selesia's attacks before revealing that she is fully aware of their plan and can escape at any time, but chooses to play along to entertain the audience. Back at Nissan Stadium, Blitz confronts his creator, Shunma, about why she killed his daughter, Erina, in his story. The two talks about their ideologies, but they are unable to see eye-to-eye and Blitz prepares to kill her. Before he can do so, however, the military intervenes. It is then revealed that Shunma resurrected Erina and is using her as a hostage to force Blitz to betray Altair.

 |ShortSummary    = Shunma gives Blitz the option to return to his world with Erina if he betrays Altair. Back with Sōta, Magane reveals that she knows that he attempts to make his own creation to help stop Altair. She then claims that the readers of his story will accept it and provokes him into rejecting that claim, allowing her to use her powers the make people accept it. She also returns "Hangaku" to Yūya. When asked by Sōta why she is helping him she tells him that it's just to entertain herself. With "Hangaku" returned to him and receiving aid from Hikayu, who has become a martial artist due to Nishio's alterations, and Blitz, who switched sides, Yūya defeats Shō. Despite this, however, Shō continues swearing vengeance against Yūya for killing his sister and friend. This prompts Yūya to spoil their story's ending by revealing he didn't kill anyone and was set up by the true culprit, who is revealed to be the same person who gave Shō his powers. Selesia casts a spell that temporary cuts Altair off from her powers. Rui and Alicetelia, who realized that Altair killed Mamika, then charge at her, but are intercepted by Charon piloting a darker version of Vogelchevalier.

 |ShortSummary    = Selesia can't bring herself to fight Charon, who is tired of fighting and thus intends to use the power of the creators to save their world. Meanwhile, Alicetelia fights Altair, who reveals to her that she was indeed the one who killed Mamika. Provoked by Altair, Alicetelia charges at her and successfully impales her with lance. However, Altair then uses an ability that changes the principle of cause and effect, causing Alicetelia to be the one injured by her attack and resulting in her dying and disappearing. Meanwhile, Rui holds off Charon while Selesia still can't bring herself to fight him. Yūya, Hikayu, Blitz and Shō, who was convinced by Yūya to join them, try to aid Rui, but are intercepted by Altair. Selesia finally makes by her mind after both Hikayu and Rui scold both her and Charon respectively for not fulfilling their duties as the leads of their story. She then uses a spell that immobilizes both hers and Charon's Vogelchevaliers and convinces Rui to fire at them with his "Gigas Machina", killing them both.

 |ShortSummary    = Following Selesia's death, Rui's "Gigas Machina" runs out of power while Altair simply laughs. Enraged by this, Hikayu charges at her, only for Altair to take away her abilities. This causes Meteora to realize that Altair has gained the audience's acceptance, removing the limitations on her abilities. In response to this, the creators use their secret weapon, Sirius; a creation with the same powers as Altair, based on the final design made by Setsuna. Knowing they cannot defeat her, the creators have Sirius use her abilities to absorb Altair into herself. With Altair seemingly defeated everyone breaths of sigh of relief, until Sirius empales Yūya with several swords. It is then revealed that, because Sirius didn't have a personality, Altair was able to take control of her body. She then proceeds to easily defeat Shō, leaving only Blitz to fight her as the real world begins to collapse. In response, Sōta proposes to the Creators that they use the Creation he made. Meteora tries to bring Sōta's creation of the real world and, because Magane used her ability to make the audience accept it, it works. The creations are then transported to a train station where they are confronted by Setsuna, much to Altair's shock.

 |ShortSummary    = Altair realizes that the Setsuna in front of her is a creation based of her, yet possessing all her memories and feelings. Setsuna apologizes to Altair, believing herself to be responsible for everything since she created her as an outlet for her pain. However, Altair tells her that her desiring to destroy the real world is something she decided for herself. Setsuna then convinces Altair to stop and the two reconcile. However, Setsuna concludes that, since the real her is already dead, she shouldn't exist in the real world anymore and attempts to replicate her real self's suicide by throwing herself in front of a train. Altair tries to save her and, because the audience wants her to, she succeeds. She then proceeds to create an entire world where she and Setsuna could be together for the rest of eternity. Realizing that Sōta is her creator, Setsuna tells Altair that she originally created her to show her to him. Overhearing this brings Sōta to tears, finally being a creator like she was. ''Border World Coliseum'' then ends with the screen simply displaying the words: ''"Mundum divit factum, atque pulchre.'' (THE WORLD IS FULL OF ABUNDANCE AND BEAUTY)''"''.

 |ShortSummary    = Following the end of ''Border World Coliseum'', the creators praise Sōta for his creation. Takashi mourns over Selesia's death, but Meteora ensures him that she'll continue to exist as long as he continues to write her story. Several weeks later, Meteora tells the surviving creations that her magic is fading due to it going in against the laws of the real world. She therefore gives the others several days to do as they like before sending them back to their own worlds; Yūya and Shō renew their friendship, Rui and Hikayu enjoy a normal day and Sōta visits Setsuna's grave with Meteora. On the last possible day, Meteora opens a portal and the other creations return to their worlds. However, because she created the portal, Meteora herself can't use it. Her magic then fades away, causing her to become a normal person. Meteora decides to become a creator while the other creators move on with their lives. Some time later, Sōta receives a text message from Meteora that she's almost finished with the novel she's writing, but can't decide on a title. Sōta texts Meteora back and the words of encouragement he gives her prompts her to call her story ''"Re:CREATORS"''.

'''Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping''' is a radical performance community based in New York City. The Stop Shopping Choir is accompanied by a comic preacher, Reverend Billy. The philosophy of the Church of Stop Shopping surrounds the imminent "Shopocalypse", which assumes the end of humanity will come about through manic [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name=mcclish&gt; {{Cite journal|last=McClish|first=Carmen L|title=Activism based in embarrassment: The anti-consumption spirituality of the Reverend Billy|journal=Liminalities: A Journal of Performance Studies|volume=5.2 (2009)|pages=1-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stop Shopping Choir accompanies Reverend Billy and stages [[Guerrilla theatre|guerrilla theater]] style actions, singing on the property of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] stores,&lt;ref name=burke&gt; {{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/monteburke/2011/04/21/reverend-billy-and-his-crusade-against-consumerism/2/|title=Reverend Billy and His Crusade Against Consumerism|last=Burke|first=Monte|date=April 21, 2011|work=Forbes|access-date=October 5, 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monsanto]] facilities,&lt;ref name=burke/&gt; and [[Trump Tower]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-activists-who-are-staging-acts-of-protest-inside-trump-tower|title=The Activists Who Are Staging Protest in Trump Tower.|last=Moynihan|first=Colin|date=June 14, 2017|work=The New Yorker|access-date=October 5, 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

The group uses the content from their direct actions to create songs that are performed on concert stages and in cabarets. The director of these shows is church co-founder Savitri D. The music director is Nehemiah Luckett. Reverend Billy and the Stop Shopping Choir routinely perform at [[Joe's Pub]] at [[The Public Theater]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/lypsinka-reverend-billy-and-tori-scott-coming-to-joes-pub-may-11-18|title=John Epperson, Reverend Billy, and Tori Scott Coming to Joe's Pub May 11–18|last=Viagas|first=Robert|date=October 5, 2017|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of Reverend Billy==

[[File:RevBilly1.jpg|thumb|left|Reverend Billy attempting to exorcise bad loans and toxic assets from the Bank of America ATM in Union Square, New York City, 2009]]

The character of Reverend Billy was developed in the early 1990s by actor and playwright, William Talen. His family was Dutch Calvinist,&lt;ref name=kalb&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/27/arts/spring-theater-visions-america-downtown-gospel-according-reverend-billy.html|title=The Downtown Gospel According to Reverend Billy|last=Kalb|first=Jonathan|date=February 27, 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 5, 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]], a conservative sect concentrated in Holland and Grand Rapids, Michigan. The precepts of this kind of [[Christianity]] were the basis for Dutch [[Afrikaners]] system of [[Apartheid]] in South Africa.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Talen grew up in small towns throughout Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. He left home at 16, moving east with Charles and Patricia Gaines, a writer and painter who encouraged him as an artist. Talen began to perform his poems and stories, hitch-hiking from Philadelphia to New York to San Francisco.&lt;ref name=jacobs&gt; {{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/profile-of-william-talen-better-known-as-reverend-billy-2015-2?r=UK&amp;IR=T|title=The craziest thing about this legendary singing, anti-corporate preacher is that he isn't real|last=Jacobs|first=Harrison|date=February 4, 2015|work=Business Insider|access-date=March 29, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talen's chief collaborator in developing the Reverend Billy character was the Reverend Sidney Lanier, a cousin of [[Tennessee Williams]].&lt;ref name=kalb/&gt; Lanier was vicar of The [[Church of St. Clement Mary Hofbauer|St. Clement's]] in the 1960s, an Episcopal Church in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=kalb/&gt; In an effort to increase attendance at St. Clement's, Lanier had torn out the altar and pews, inviting actors to perform scenes from plays by Tennessee Williams and Terrence McNally, and founding founding the American Place Theater. Lanier described Talen as "more of a preacher with a gift for social prophecy than an actor.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=kalb/&gt; In the early 1990s Talen moved with Lanier to New York City from the San Francisco Bay Area, branding his act as a "new kind of American preacher"&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt;

The Reverend Billy character debuted on the sidewalk at Times Square in 1998, outside the Disney Store, where he proclaimed Mickey Mouse to be the anti-Christ.&lt;ref name=kalb/&gt; He was arrested multiple times outside the Disney Store, where he duct-tapped Mickey Mouse to a cross.&lt;ref name=Kasperkevic&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/27/reverend-billy-church-of-stop-shopping-black-friday|title=The Church of Stop Shopping doesn't pull punches on its return to New York.|last=Kasperkevic|first=Jana|date=November 27, 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 8, 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverend Billy's sermons decried the evils of [[consumerism]] and the racism of sweatshop labor, and what Talen saw as the loss of neighborhood spirit in [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]]'s New York.&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt;

The Reverend Billy character isn't so much a parody of a preacher, as a preacher motif used to blur the lines between performance and religious experience. "It's definitely a church service," Talen explained to ''Altnernet'', but, he added, it's "a political rally, it's theater, it's all three, it's none of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alternet.org/story/29476/the_reluctant_religion_of_reverend_billy|title=The Reluctant Religion of Reverend Billy|last=Tytel|first=Brad|date=December 12, 2005|work=Alternet|access-date=April 1, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alisa Solomon, the theater critic at the [[The Village Voice|Village Voice]], said of Reverend Billy's persona, "The collar is fake, the calling is real."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2000/03/14/never-can-say-good-buy/|title=Never Can Say Good Buy|last=Solomon|first=Alisa|date=March 14, 2000|work=The Village Voice|access-date=October 8, 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Church of Stop Shopping, they have been referred to by academics as  "performance activism,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perucci|first=Tony|year=2009|title=What the Fuck is That?: The Poetics of Ruptural Performance|journal=Liminalities: A Journal of Performance Studies|volume=5.3|pages=1-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; "carnivalesque protest,"&lt;ref name="mcclish" /&gt; and "commercial disobedience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/22/magazine/reverend-billy-s-unholy-war.html|title=Reverend Billy's Unholy War.|last=Dee|first=Jonathan|date=August 22, 2004|work=The New York Times Magazine|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Savitri D, church co-founder and theatrical director==

Savitri D (née Durkee) is the co-founder and director of the Church of Stop Shopping, as well as Talen's partner.&lt;ref name=kolbert&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/buzzkill-2|title=Buzzkill|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|date=May 19, 2014|work=The New Yorker|access-date=March 29, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born in [[Taos, New Mexico]] in 1972. She was raised at [[Lama Foundation|The Lama Foundation]], one of the earliest and longest lasting intentional spiritual communities in the US, founded by her parents, Steven and Barbara Durkee.&lt;ref&gt;Banner, Lois W. "Finding Fran: History and Memory in the Lives of Two Women", Columbia University Press, 1998, p. 173. {{ISBN|0-231-11216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Savitri D began dancing and performing at the University of Montana, studied at the [[Merce Cunningham]] Dance Company, and co-founded a dance collective called The Zen Monkey Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zenmonkeyproject.com/history/|title=History of Past Performances|website=Zen Monkey Project|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to New York City in 1997, she staged her play SKY/NO SKY at 57 Walker Street&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://franklinfurnace.org/goings_on/recent_goings_on/2003/03_03_13.php|title=Franklin Furnace's Goings On|date=March 13, 2003|website=Franklin's Furnace|dead-url=|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2000, she was a producer at The Culture Project, a theater in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], where Talen was staging early Reverend Billy performances.&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt; She took over direction of The Church of Stop Shopping performances from the dramatist Tony Torn&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/reviews/03-2000/reverend-billy_350.html|title=Reviews: Reverend Billy|last=Josh|first=Godfrey|date=March 17, 2000|work=Theater Mania|access-date=March 31, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, and married Talen the next year.&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt;

Under Savitri D's leadership, the Church won the Alpert Award for Theater&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://herbalpertawards.org/artist/2010/bill-talen|title=The Herb Alpert Award in the Arts|website=The Herb Alpert Awards|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Edwin Booth Award&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Theatre/Doctoral-Theatre-Students-Association-(DTSA)/Booth-Award|title=Booth Award, Previous Award Recipients|website=The Graduate Center, CUNY|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[City University of New York]].

==The Stop Shopping Choir==

The Stop Shopping Choir is a 35-member ensemble that performs an array of original gospel songs in theater performances and alongside Reverend Billy in public spaces during campaigns.&lt;ref name=revbilly.com&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.revbilly.com/about_the_stop_shopping_choir|title=About The Stop Shopping Choir|website=revbilly.com|dead-url=|access-date=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/nyregion/reverend-billy-brings-a-new-sermon-to-joes-pub.html|title=Reverend Billy Brings a New Sermon to Joe's Pub|last=Lee|first=A.C.|date=May 15, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 2, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choir began accompanying Talen's sermons at concert shows shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]], adding a musical influence to Reverend Billy performances.&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt; Led by musical director Nehemiah Luckett,&lt;ref name=revbilly.com/&gt; the choir members are volunteers who rehearse weekly at the Lower Eastside Girl's Club in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-monsanto-loses-its-name-what-will-its-haters-have-left-to-hate-1477402968|title=If Monsanto Loses Its Name, What Will Its Haters Have Left to Hate?|last=Bunge|first=Jacob|date=October 15, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=April 2, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Choir often write songs that draw attention to the environmental and consumerist campaigns championed by the Church of Stop Shopping. They have accompanied Talen into the lobbies of multinational banks such as JP Morgan Chase or research facilities belonging to Monsanto, dressed as golden toads and honeybees, singing songs in support of the day's sermon. One of their best-known songs is The First Amendment, an incantation of the 1st Amendment of the [[United States Constitution]], sung rapturously by soprano Laura Newman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.revbilly.com/the_first_amendment_song|title=The First Amendment Song|website=revbilly.com|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Direct Action Campaigns==

In addition to protest performances throughout a given year, Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping have organized various campaigns focused on consumerist or environmental issues, often highlighting a particular company they feel best symbolizes the issue. The group stage actions in public spaces near the targets of their actions, or in the lobbies, halls, and plazas of the building owned by the companies they protest. Their sermons and songs routinely draw the attention of police and security forces assigned to those spaces, leading to arrests and significant media coverage. Talen and Savitri D have been arrested more than 50 times during their actions, though their charges are almost always reduced or dropped.&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt;

===Early campaigns===
Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping staged numerous actions around New York City in their formative years. In 2000, after performing a Christmas show the [[The New School|New School]]'s Tishman Auditorium, Reverend Billy led the congregation and members of the audience from the stage to the [[Edgar Allan Poe House (Manhattan)|Poe House]] on West 3rd Street in Manhattan's [[West Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/merry-christmas-rev-billy-performance-preacher-hosts-poe-service-dec-16-com-93856|title=Merry Christmas, Rev. Billy: Performance Preacher Hosts Poe Service Dec. 16|last=Ehren|first=Christine|date=December 16, 2000|work=Playbill|access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, the Reverend held a protest reading of "[[The Raven]]" atop the scaffolding over the soon-to-be-demolished home where [[Edgar Allan Poe|Edgar Allen Poe]] had finished writing the famous poem. After the reading, Talen was arrested and jailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playloud.org/archiveandstore/en/dvd/60-reverend-billy.html|title=Reverend Billy &amp; The Church of Stop Shopping|last=Post|first=Dietmar|last2=Palacios|first2=Lucía|year=2002|website=playloud!|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], the Church and Choir met routinely in the [[PATH (rail system)|Path Station]] near [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] and sang the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] into their phones as commuters passed by. The crowd of singers sometimes reached up to 200 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/He-s-a-preacher-of-sorts-who-has-found-his-2764879.php|title=He's a preacher -- of sorts -- who has found his calling: rooting out the evils of consumerism, block by entertaining block|last=Ganahl|first=Jane|date=April 24, 2004|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2007, just before the start of the monthly [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass bike]] ride, Reverend Billy and Savitri D recited the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] repeatedly to police officers through a megaphone in Manhattan's Union Square. Reverend Billy was arrested on charges of second-degree harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/26/nyregion/26billy.html|title=A Street Performer Crusades for the First Amendment|last=Hartocollis|first=Anemona|date=September 26, 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The civil liberties lawyer [[Norman Siegel]] defended Reverend Billy in court, saying "Reverend Billy has a First Amendment right to recite the First Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/nyregion/01billy.html|title=A Pretend Preacher, a Real Arrest and a Debate About Free Speech|last=Wilensky-Lanford|first=Ethan|date=July 1, 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Starbucks===
The Church of Stop Shopping staged a series of actions across the country from 2002 to 2008, protesting against what they call Starbucks company's enactment of "fake bohemia." Reverend Billy and the singers tried to "exorcise the demon of cookie-cutter capitalism" from its cash registers, by laying hands on the register, weeping, and harmonizing.&lt;ref name=Kasperkevic/&gt;

The [[Starbucks]] coffee chain has been a frequent target of the Church's actions, due to displacement of small local businesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbandisplacement.org/case-studies/ucla#section-91|title=Impact of Big Businesses in Chinatown|last=Macedo|first=Edber|last2=Fang|first2=Jimmy|date=July 1, 2014|website=UCLA Case Studies|dead-url=|access-date=November 12, 2017|last3=Le|first3=Thomas|last4=Ong|first4=Paul M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[union busting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/zp-heller/spilling-the-beans-about_b_205497.html|title=Spilling the Beans About Starbucks' Union-Busting Tactics|last=Heller|first=ZP|date=May 25, 2011|work=HuffPost|access-date=November 12, 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exploitation of coffee farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8355026|title=Storm in a coffee cup: Starbucks vs Ethiopia.|date=November 30, 2006|work=The Economist|access-date=April 23, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Starbucks branches throughout New York City issued a document to its workers entitled "What Should I do If Reverend Billy Is in My Store?",&lt;ref name=talen&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thenewpress.com/books/what-should-i-do-if-reverend-billy-my-store|title=What Should I Do if Reverend Billy is in My Store|last=Talen|first=Bill|date=April 1, 2005|website=New York Press|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which outlines an evacuation protocol and a series of scripted reassurances that workers are ordered to deliver to disturbed or inquisitive customers. The title of the document is also the title of a book written by Talen, published by The New Press.&lt;ref name=talen/&gt;

In 2004, Starbucks persuaded a Los Angeles judge to issue an injunction against Talen, demanding that he cease and desist from "stalking, contacting, or sexually harassing the computerized cash registers of the Starbucks Company."&lt;ref name=talen/&gt;

===Golden Toads and Bank Actions===
In 2012 and 2013, Reverend Billy and the Church focused on the extinction of species brought by climate change, specifically targeting banks they said financed projects that worsened global warming. The symbolic centerpiece of these campaigns was the extinct [[Golden toad]], originally native to [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve|Monteverde cloud forest]] in Costa Rica and a symbol for the crisis of [[Decline in amphibian populations|declining amphibian species]]. Savitri D and the choir wore papier mâché masks depicting golden toads as they entered JP Morgan Chase and HSBC banks.&lt;ref name=vidal&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/25/reverend-billy-jpmorgan-chase-toad-protest-talen|title=Reverend Billy faces year in prison for JP Morgan Chase toad protest|last=Vidal|first=John|date=November 25, 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In one action in a Chase bank in New York City, Reverend Billy and choir director Nehemiah Luckett were arrested and charged with riot, trespass, unlawful assembly, and disorderly conduct. According to the bank manager in a complaint to police, Reverend Billy and the choir were "running about the bank while wearing frog masks … jumping on to the bank's furniture, running about the bank, and screaming loudly at others for a number of minutes." The manager also stated that he thought the bank was being robbed, that he feared for his safety, and that customers or bank employees even cried.&lt;ref name=vidal/&gt;

Despite the complaints against them and what the New York prosecutor called a "criminal stunt," demanding that Talen go to prison for a year, their charges were eventually dropped.&lt;ref name=kolbert/&gt;

===British Petroleum and Liberate Tate===
As part of the Church of Stop Shopping's efforts to urge art institutions to reject sponsorship from petroleum companies, they have protested at a number of museums around the world.&lt;ref name=vidaltate&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jul/19/reverend-billy-tate-modern-bp|title=Reverend Billy leads exorcism of BP's 'evil spirit' from Tate Modern|last=Vidal|first=John|date=July 19, 2011|work=The Guardian|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2011, while on tour in the UK, Reverend Billy and the Choir staged an action at the Tate Modern in London to protest its sponsorship by the oil company British Petroleum (BP). The church was invited by a coalition of UK groups, including Liberate Tate, BP or Not BP, Platform, UK Tar Sands Network, London Rising Tide, Art Not Oil and Climate Rush.&lt;ref name=vidaltate/&gt;

While crowds observed the scene in the Turbine Room of the Tate, the choir splashed Reverend Billy and the BP sunflower logo with bottles of black oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luoL5A-SHQk|title=Reverend Billy exorcizes BP at Tate Modern|last=Talen|first=Billy|date=July 19, 2011|via=YouTube|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the performance, the protesters exited the museum singing onto the lawn outside, and rallied on the shore of the Thames against oil companies and their involvement in the arts.&lt;ref name=vidaltate/&gt;

===Robobees===

In 2014, Reverend Billy, Savitri D and the Choir turned their focus to [[colony collapse disorder]] affecting the world's honeybees. In one action, they entered the Micro-robotics Laboratory at Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Science to confront scientists working on the invention of robot pollinators, popularly known as RoboBees. They purchased fruits and vegetables to place before a display case with a model of the RoboBee, singing and lamenting the focus of scientists replacing living bees with robots, rather than solving the collapse.&lt;ref name=forde&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/6/2/robotic-bee-project.html|title=Taking off from Harvard Yard: Flight of the RoboBees|last=Forde|first=Kaelyn|date=June 2, 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

“We ask you to place your genius, your research, your scientific know-how into ''saving'' the honeybee," Talen said to those assembled. Attending the event and writing for [[The New Yorker]], [[Elizabeth Kolbert]] noted the confusion among some of the Harvard graduate students witnessing the singing and preaching. "We like people not to know if we're a political rally, a religious service, or a theatrical comedy about a church," Reverend Billy told Kolbert. "If they have all three spinning in their head, and they can't settle on one, then they're probably having a raw experience."&lt;ref name=kolbert/&gt;

===Monsanto===
The Church of Stop Shopping has also targeted chemical manufacturer [[Monsanto]] for its production of [[Glyphosate|glysophate]] herbicides and [[neonicotinoid]] pesticides.&lt;ref name=forde/&gt; In November 2014, the Church traveled to Monsanto's headquarters in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], where they held an "Organic Thanksgiving."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/events/1490386454559843/|title=Organic Thanksgiving at Monsanto World Headquarters|date=November 24, 2014|website=|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2018}}{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Reverend Billy &amp; The Stop Shopping Choir opened a series of shows for [[Neil Young]] during his tour in support of ''[[The Monsanto Years]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diffuser.fm/fellow-monsanto-opponent-reverend-billy-to-open-for-neil-young-in-nyc/|title=Fellow Monsanto Opponent Reverend Billy to Open for Neil Young in NYC|last=Rossignol|first=Derrick|date=July 3, 2015|website=Diffuser|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2016, Reverend Billy was arrested while protesting the [[World Food Prize]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. He was charged with trespass for leaving the "free speech area"  set up near the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/342380/a-performance-troupe-takes-on-immigration-monsanto-and-standing-rock/|title=A Performance Troupe Takes on Immigration, Monsanto, and Standing Rock|last=Hamm|first=Theodore|date=December 2, 2016|work=Hyperallergenic|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor for the state requested "that the Court preclude evidence or argument regarding 'free speech rights,' 'free expression,'right to assemble,' and/or other First Amendment arguments and evidence that 'free speech rights' can constitute 'justification' under the Iowa's criminal trespass statute, Iowa Code §716.7 (2015)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/revbilly/pages/857/attachments/original/1483909235/Motion_in_Limine_-_Trepassing_Cases_(Talen___Cordaro)_(1).PDF?1483909235|title=STATE'S MOTION IN LIMINE, AND/OR FOR 5.104(A) RULING|date=January 2, 2017|website=|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge in the case ultimately dismissed the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/01/monsanto-amendment-170124075931929.html|title=On Monsanto and the First Amendment|last=Talen|first=Billy|date=January 24, 2017|publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, the Church released a guide called "The United States Map of Poisoned Parks and Playgrounds," which shows the dosage and location of glyphosate applications around the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.revbilly.com/nationalmap|title=U.S. Map of Poisoned Parks and Playgrounds|website=revbilly.com|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SimplyMusicLogotype.gif|right]]
'''Simply Music''' is a [[music education]] institution licensing teachers at over 700 locations in twelve countries. [[Australians|Australian]] music educator [[Neil Moore (musician)|Neil Moore]] founded it on the core belief that all humans are naturally musical. Simply Music offers programs for students from birth through old age, with the stated goal that "students acquire and retain music as a lifelong companion." Simply Music patterns its approach after primary language acquisition, where speaking comes first.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simplymusic.com/about/|title=about Simply Music piano|last=|first=|date=|website=Simply Music|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this it shares some philosophical ground with other developmental approaches like [[Kodály Method|Kodály]], [[Orff-Schulwerk]], and the [[Suzuki Method]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Campbell, Patricia Shehan and Carol Scott-Kassner. ''Music in Childhood: From Preschool through the Elementary Grades''. New York: Schirmer, 1995. 47-57. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Neil Moore began constructing the Simply Music method in the late 20th century while teaching [[piano]] to a young [[Blindness|blind]] student. Since traditional music-reading would not serve this student, Moore designed a program based on his own childhood musical experiences. Instead of reading music, as a child Moore had naturally visualized patterns within the songs and on the keyboard. He explained these building blocks to this student, who learned to play piano himself and began teaching the songs to his four-year-old sister, who was also blind.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

This spurred Moore to begin testing his ideas more widely, and he found this approach natural and successful for students of all ages and abilities. Other piano teachers began learning from Moore. When he could no longer personally train them all, Moore founded the Simply Music organization and developed a remote [[certification]] program that is currently available to teachers in twelve countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, Bernadette E. "Coming Home: The Story of One Man." ''A World Where Everyone Plays''. Ed. Bernadette E. Ashby. Sunnyvale, CA: Efting Press, 2011. 1-7. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Simply Music expanded to include [[early childhood music education]], and also worked with Karen Nisenson to create [http://simplymusicgateway.com/ Simply Music Gateway], an adaptive piano curriculum for children with [[special needs]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Philosophy ==
Simply Music's founding premise is similar to [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shin'ichi Suzuki]]’s claim that any child can learn [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, Shinichi. ''Nurtured by Love: The Classic Approach to Talent Education''. Miami: Warner Bros. Publications Inc., 1999. 1-3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; But Simply Music extends the concept, like researchers [http://www.conservatorium.unimelb.edu.au/staff/garymcphersonary E. McPherson Gary E. McPherson] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20130908161959/http://www.imerc.org/people.php Graham F. Welch], who write that it is our "birthright" to "be able to communicate and interact musically with others."&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Graham F. and Gary E. McPherson. "Introduction and Commentary: The Role of Music in People’s Lives." ''The Oxford Handbook of Music Education, vol. I''. Ed. Gary E. McPherson and Graham F. Welch. New York: Oxford University Press, 2012. 6. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same degree, Simply Music declares musicality essential to human nature. Adherents identify many everyday activities as fundamentally musical because these activities thoughtlessly fall into patterns of [[rhythm]] and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. As examples they cite speaking, walking, and brushing teeth. Simply Music seeks both to draw on and to nurture this natural ability by distilling musical concepts into simple patterns.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://simplymusic.com/wp-content/uploads/documents/SMP_StudentBrochure_2016-17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Students use these patterns to begin playing songs in their first lessons. This method is modeled after primary [[language acquisition]], where learners begin by speaking. Many other music education approaches—including [[Orff Schulwerk]] and the [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics|Dalcroze]], [[Kodály Method|Kodály]], and [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]] methods—engage students physically first and teach [[Musical notation|notation]] later.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The complete Simply Music program aims to teach music for generalists, who may or may not later choose a specialty such as performing [[classical music]], playing [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] in a band, or [[Accompaniment|accompanying]] [[Soloist (music)|soloists]] or theater performers. The program attempts to prepare students with a solid music background that can take them where they choose. The primary goal is for students to keep music in their life, most often for [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]] and enjoyment at home or with family and friends. As such, Simply Music includes a wide variety of musical [[genres]], such as [[Classical music|classical]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[Popular music|popular]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Simply Music does not focus on mastering classical [[concert]] performance [[Musical technique|technique]]. Instead, Simply Music teachers encourage students to play [[Musical expression|expressively]] and comfortably, without tension.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simplymusic.com/wp-content/uploads/documents/SMP_TeacherBrochure_2016-17.pdf|title=Teaching Simply Music pdf|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==

The Simply Music approach contrasts with many other music learning methods, where the ability to play music depends first on learning to read music. Moore terms these traditional methods ''reading-based ''and his approach ''playing-based''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simplymusic.com/wp-content/uploads/documents/SMP_StudentBrochure_2016-17.pdf|title=Simply Music student brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core playing-based piano pieces are presented in the Foundation Program, a series of 9 levels of 7-10 songs each. The pieces are designed to provide experience with many musical styles and genres, to build students’ physical dexterity at the piano, and to give students hands-on familiarity with fundamental musical concepts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Alongside the Foundation Program, and often using concepts from the Foundation pieces, students learn [[Arrangement (music)|arrangement]], [[Improvisation (music)|improvisation]], [[Composition (music)|composition]], [[Chord (music)|chord]]-reading, and [[Music theory|theory]]. Teachers are required to present all these programs, as they are considered essential to a well-rounded music education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Simply Music maintains that their approach—based on learning to recognize patterns inherent in music—is distinct from learning by rote or by ear. Students learn through patterns on the keyboard, in their fingers, and in the music itself. Students learn the physical shape that a melody line or a chord forms in the hand or on the keyboard. For example, a basic [[Triad (music)|triad]] such as [[D major|D Major]] is seen as a triangle shape on the keyboard, with the two white notes forming the base and the black note at the top. Musical patterns include concepts like [[Ostinato|repeated rhythmic]] or [[melodic pattern]]s (or [[Sequence (music)|sequences]]), melodic sentences, [[musical forms]] such as ABA, and chord progressions like the [[12-bar blues]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Experience with these concepts provides a foundation for learning note-reading during the second year. Simply Music first teaches rhythm notation, followed by pitch reading, and then applies these skills to pieces written in standard music notation. Students learn to read pitches by identifying intervals, rather than individual note-names. This is known as an ''intervallic ''approach.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Simply Music also uses what they call ''[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/generative generative] ''learning, meaning that students write music as an integral part of learning to read music.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As students further expand their musicianship, they move into the Development Program, which applies their musical understanding and note-reading skills to increasingly complex written music. Lessons continue to include arrangement, improvisation, composition, chord-reading, and theory. At this phase, students also explore their own musical interests in more depth.

Simply Music piano may be taught in either shared or private lessons.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The early childhood program is taught in small groups.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Early childhood==

Simply Music partners with an affiliate young childhood music education program, Lynn Kleiner's [https://musicrhapsody.com/ Music Rhapsody].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Music Rhapsody is a music and movement program for infants through age five. Early childhood music education specialist [http://www.musicrhapsody.com/About-Lynn-Kleiner Lynn Kleiner] based the program on the [[Orff Schulwerk]] philosophy. In keeping with its roots, the program focuses on learning through play and addresses each stage of child development. The program immerses children in music-making through diverse songs, instruments, movement, puppets and visuals. By building a foundation in music and incorporating Simply Music repertoire, it prepares students to transition into the piano program.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;http://www.musicrhapsody.com/Why-Music-Rhapsody/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Materials ==

All the Simply Music programs use a variety of multimedia materials to provide [[multisensory learning]]. Simply Music Piano and Accordion students use written music as well as other written materials to remember assignments and track their progress. Video recordings distill the main points of every lesson. Audio recordings help students become familiar with the songs, refine style and technique, and develop ensemble skills. Teacher training is also presented through multimedia materials.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Early childhood Music Rhapsody students use a wide variety of specially designed instruments along with movement materials, puppets, and visuals. The program also provides audio recordings for students and teachers, as well as video support for teachers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Repertoire==
The Simply Music Piano and Accordion repertoire covers a broad range of styles, including classical, contemporary, jazz, blues, gospel, and other styles from around the world. In addition to the core Foundation pieces, students learn arrangements of each piece, along with accompaniments, teacher-selected written pieces, student-choice songs, and student compositions.

A student’s personal repertoire is called their Playlist. A Playlist is considered essential, partly because a large and varied repertoire helps facilitate lifelong musical engagement. Also, each new piece builds on musical concepts from earlier pieces.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Music Rhapsody curriculum centers around [[children’s music]], both traditional and contemporary, and also introduces many styles including classical, jazz, blues, and international music.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A '''sin-eater''' is a person who consumes a ritual meal in order to [[Magic (supernatural)|magically]] take on the [[sin]]s of a person or household. The food was believed to absorb the sins of a recently deceased person, thus [[Absolution of the dead|absolving]] the soul of the person. Sin-eaters, as a consequence,  carried the sins of all people whose sins they had eaten. [[Cultural anthropologists]] and [[folklorist]]s classify sin-eating as a form of [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] [[ritual]]&lt;ref name="Davidson 1993p85"&gt;[[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] (1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHPYAAAAMAAJ ''Boundaries &amp; Thresholds''] p.85 quotation: {{quotation|It is this fear of what the dead in their uncontrollable power might cause which has brought forth apotropaic rites, protective rites against the dead. [...] One of these popular rites was the funeral rite of sin-eating, performed by a sin-eater, a man or woman. Through accepting the food and drink provided, he took upon himself the sins of the departed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[magic and religion|religious magic]].

==History==
Although the figure of the sin-eater has had various references in modern culture, the questions of how common the practice was, what regions of the world in which it was most common, and what the interactions between sin-eaters, common people, and religious authorities were, remain largely unstudied and in the realm of folklore.

In mythology, [[Tlazolteotl]], the Aztec goddess of earth, motherhood and fertility, had a redemptive role in the religious practices of the [[Meso-American]] civilization.  At the end of an individual's life, he was allowed to confess his misdeeds to this deity, and according to legend she would cleanse his soul by "eating its filth".

[[Jesus of Nazareth]] has been interpreted as a universal archetype for sin-eaters, offering his life to atone or purify all of humanity of their sins.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite book|last=Walford Davies, Richard Marggraf Turley |first=Damian |title=The Monstrous Debt: Modalities of Romantic Influence in Twentieth-century Literature|year=2006 |publisher=Wayne State University |isbn=0814330584 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVh_qVyFt6kC&amp;d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Bagford]], (ca.1650–1716) includes the following description of the sin-eating ritual in his ''letter on Leland’s Collectanea'', i. 76. (as cited in [[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]], 1898)
{{quote|Notice was given to an old sire before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket [low stool], on which he sat down facing the door; then they gave him a groat which he put in his pocket, a crust of bread which he ate, and a bowl of ale which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced the case and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul.}}

A local legend in [[Shropshire]], [[England]], concerns the grave of Richard Munslow, who died in 1906, said to be the last sin-eater of the area:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-11360659 | title=Last 'sin-eater' to be celebrated with church service | date=19 September 2010 | accessdate=2010-09-19 | work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|By eating bread and drinking ale, and by making a short speech at the graveside, the sin-eater took upon themselves the sins of the deceased". The speech was written as: "I give easement and rest now to thee, dear man. Come not down the lanes or in our meadows. And for thy peace I pawn my own soul. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shropshiregallery.co.uk/towns/ratlinghope/ratlinghope.html The Sin Eaters' Grave at Ratlinghope] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208141333/http://www.shropshiregallery.co.uk/towns/ratlinghope/ratlinghope.html |date=8 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 1926 book ''Funeral Customs'' by [[Bertram S. Puckle]] mentions the sin-eater:
{{quote|Professor Evans of the Presbyterian College, Carmarthen, actually saw a sin-eater about the year 1825, who was then living near [[Llanwenog]], [[Ceredigion|Cardiganshire]]. Abhorred by the superstitious villagers as a thing unclean, the sin-eater cut himself off from all social intercourse with his fellow creatures by reason of the life he had chosen; he lived as a rule in a remote place by himself, and those who chanced to meet him avoided him as they would a leper. This unfortunate was held to be the associate of [[evil spirits]], and given to [[witchcraft]], incantations and unholy practices; only when a death took place did they seek him out, and when his purpose was accomplished they burned the wooden bowl and platter from which he had eaten the food handed across, or placed on the corpse for his consumption.&lt;ref name="sacred"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/etc/fcod/fcod07.htm SacredTexts.com: Food]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Howlett mentions sin-eating as an old custom in [[Hereford]], and thus describes the practice: "The corpse being taken out of the house, and laid on a bier, a loaf of bread was given to the sin-eater over the corpse, also a maga-bowl of maple, full of beer. These consumed, a fee of sixpence was given him for the consideration of his taking upon himself the sins of the deceased, who, thus freed, would not walk after death."

The [[Britannica 1911|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] states in its article on "sin eaters":
{{quote|A symbolic survival of it (''sin eating'') was witnessed as recently as 1893 at Market Drayton, [[Shropshire]]. After a preliminary service had been held over the coffin in the house, a woman poured out a glass of wine for each bearer and handed it to him across the coffin with a 'funeral biscuit.' In Upper [[Bavaria]] sin-eating still survives: a corpse cake is placed on the breast of the dead and then eaten by the nearest relative, while in the [[Balkan peninsula]] a small bread image of the deceased is made and eaten by the survivors of the family. The Dutch doed-koecks or '[[dead-cakes]]', marked with the initials of the deceased, introduced into America in the 17th century, were long given to the attendants at funerals in old [[New York (state)|New York]]. The 'burial-cakes' which are still made in parts of rural England, for example [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Cumberland]], are almost certainly a relic of sin-eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911||wstitle=Sin-eater|volume=25|pages=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''The Holy Family with Angels'''''  (1645) is an [[oil painting]] on canvas by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Rembrandt]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[Hermitage Museum]].

== Description ==
This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1915, who wrote; "94. THE HOLY FAMILY WITH THE ANGELS. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. 72.]]; [[Wilhelm von Bode|Bode]] 321 ; [[Eugène Dutuit|Dutuit]] 59; [[Alfred von Wurzbach|Wb.]] 391 ; B.-HdG. 251. In the foreground of [[St. Joseph|Joseph's]] carpenter's workshop, the Virgin Mary sits on a low chair, holding a large open book on her left arm. She rests her left foot on a foot-warmer and leans over to the left to draw the green curtain of the cradle in which the Child lies asleep under a red fur-lined coverlet. Mary wears a deep red gown and dark blue skirt, and a white kerchief and cap. Behind her in half-shadow, Joseph, in a brown working-dress, is shaping a [[yoke]] with his axe. From above to the left child-angels flutter down, throwing a bright light on the Virgin and the cradle. Full-length figures, almost half life-size. Signed on the left at foot, "Rembrandt f. 1645 " ; canvas, 46 1/2 inches by 36 inches. An old copy without the angels was in the possession of an English dealer in 1899, and afterwards in the possession of a New York dealer. Another copy without the angels was in the sale : --London, June 7, 1912, No. 23 (£15 : 15s.). A pen-drawing for the picture is in the collection of [[Leon Bonnat]], Paris ; reproduced by Lippmann-Hofstede de Groot, No. 20. A study in chalk for the Child in the cradle was in the collection of [[John Postle Heseltine|J. P. Heseltine]], London, and is now in the collection of H.

==Unusual portrayal in home setting==
[[File:Harmensz van Rijn Rembrandt - Святое семейство - Google Art Project (cropped for mother and child).jpg|thumb|The baby Jesus is wearing a skull-cap with band known as a [[valhoed]] and he is propped up with cushions into a sitting position as was customary at that time]]
Rembrandt portrays the [[Holy Family]] as a typical family of [[Amsterdam]] in his day. In the foreground Jesus is asleep in the same style of wicker crib that can be seen in period paintings of mothers with babies by [[Pieter de Hooch]]. Mary looks up from her book to take a peek at the sleeping child under the crib curtain (Dutch: ''klamboe''). In the background Joseph is working on making a [[yoke]].The yoke refers both to the coming of the Lord according to [[Isaiah]]  ("For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian"), as well as the words of Jesus according to [[Matthew the Apostle]] ("Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light").

'''Los Papelípolas''' or '''The Papelipolas''' was a group of artists from [[Huila Department]], in the [[Republic of Colombia]] arising in the year 1958. Their productions in the fields of theater, the narrative, the drawing, the cinema, the television and especially in the poetry, have been widely recognized and disseminated, even several decades after its dissolution. It was disbanded in the mid-1960s, and the components continued writing independently. The group's name is ''papel'' (paper in Spanish) and ''pola'' (''cerveza'' or beer).

==The components==
The group's regular payroll poetic Los Papelípolas is limited to six authors: [[Gustavo Andrade]] (highlighted in the fields of drama prize, winner in France, Spain, [[Costa Rica]], among others, in film as screenwriter of the film ''[[The River of the Tombs]]''; librettist of radio, television and short film director and producer of ''La Cantina de José Dolores''). The others were apathetic to the events and to the movies, but with valuable works: [[Angel Sierra Basto]] (pseudonym of Victor Manuel Cortes Vargas, poet, education engine in the [[Huila Department|Huila]], and politician, author of ''Dimensions'', 1963 and ''Xenias &amp; Apophoretas of Menein Laos'', 1994), [[Dario Silva Silva]] (poet and current Archbishop of House on the Rock, one of the forty most influential men of [[Colombia]] according to ''[[Semana]]'' magazine); [[Ruben Morales Buendía]] (erotic poet and one of the first cartoonists Huila), [[Julian Polanía Perez]] (poet and politician, author of ''The concept of Grief'', 1958, and ''Narration of the Living Faces'', 1963) and [[Luis Ernesto Luna]] (poet, bureaucrat, dedicated to political propaganda, author of ''Memory of Silence'', 1988). Delimiro Moreno in his work ''The Papelípolas, Poetic Essay on a Generation'' (1995) added to [[Armando Ceron Castillo]] (author of ''Beyond Words'', 2010 ) and then talked about [[Camilo Lara Cuenca]] as an appendix of them, with a recently published poetic production (''Así Canta mi Lira'', 2005), almost posthumously. The themes and style of these poets were always very heterogeneous group, as their spiritual and political ideology.

Two of them, especially with shared affinities with the [[Beat Generation]]: [[Angel Sierra Basto]] and [[Luis Ernesto Luna]].

==The attribution of movement==
The label of "movement", may be inaccurate. The ideals and artistic group shares similarities with the [[Beat Generation]] and [[The Hungry Generation]]. The papelípolas [[Angel Sierra Basto]] and [[Luis Ernesto Suarez]] alluded to [[Nirvana]], the [[Upanishads]], Buddhism, to free sexuality, alcohol and drugs as leaks. Other reasons given for giving the label of movement (as Colombian Beat generation, which it shares with the [[nothingness]] Antioquia), was that none of its members turned professional as a response to the educational model of unbridled capitalism. For some, a result of their political ideology, for others, economic limitations, but it is common. All this feeds the [[decadence]] French [[Huysmans]] (as evident in the prologue of ''dimensions'' of [[Angel Sierra Basto]] by [[Luis Ernesto Suarez]] and the Thebaid of ''Ananké''), French writers [[Charles Baudelaire]] (''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]''), [[Gérard de Nerval]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Parnasianism]] of [[Paul Verlaine]], also at Nicaraguan literary modernism [[Rubén Darío]]. Sierra Basto, the more Beat of all, tried to deconstruct the language with their [[Rhymes Rune]], and other poems full of [[neologism]]s. Meanwhile, the founder of The Papelípolas, [[Gustavo Andrade]] was counter to provincial level, with his first [[Manifesto Papelípolas]], letter to Ramiro Bahamón by the poet [[Silvia Lorenzo]] to national poets gathered in [[Medellín]] in 1958, and published this year in the first of three [[Notebooks Huila]] group:'' Concept of Grief'' with poems [[Julian Perez Polanía]], also with his essay'' Neiva needs a mayor who wants to Neiva'' and enjoying universal recognition plays like cutting.

The artistic value of the Papelípolas, was the subject of several pages of authors like [[David Rivera Moya]], [[Roger Echavarria]], [[Oliver Lis]], [[Delimiro Moreno]], [[Félix Ramiro Losada]] and [[Jorge Guebely]]. However, the label "movement" has been accepted by custom, though its definition has been as diverse and controversial.

==The Manifesto of The Papelipolas==
The First Manifesto of Papelípolas was a letter from [[Gustavo Andrade]] to [[Ramiro Bahamón]], which was filed with the acquiescence of the group by the poet [[Silvia Lorenzo]] before nadaístas poets among others in [[Medellín]] in 1958. This manifesto was published in the first of three books published huilenses that (his first broadcast medium), edited by Gustavo Andrade,'' Concept of Grief'' of [[Julian Perez Polanía]].

==Publications==
Input publications in literary tradition were undoubtedly the [[Notebooks Huila]], achieved by successfully managing [[Gustavo Andrade Rivera]] to [[Intercol]] (International Petroleum Co.) and then the [[Echoes Magazine]] night baccalaureate [[José María Rojas Garrido]] with [[Angel Sierra Basto]] in the lead editorial in the year 1963 and 1964.

Select publications:
*ANDRADE RIVERA, Gustavo, Huila Papers, Printing Department, Neiva [1958-1963]
*ANDRADE RIVERA, Gustavo, Remington 22 and other plays, Colombian Institute of Culture, Canal Ramirez, Bogotá, 1973
*ANDRADE RIVERA, Gustavo, Gustavo Andrade Theatre Rivera, Huila Papers, # 3, Printing Department, sf, Neiva, 1972
*Polanía PÉREZ, Julian, Notion of Grief, in "Journal Huila" # 1, Printing Department, Neiva, 1958
*SIERRA BASTO, Angel [Victor Manuel Cortes Vargas] in Huila Papers, # 2, Printing Department, Neiva

All six poets published in the Journal of the Huila.

After the dissolution of the group were other publications, among which are:

*LUNA, Luis Ernesto, Memory of Silence. Poems. Journal of Cultural Extension Huilense Institute of Culture, Publishing Company of Huila, Neiva, 1988.
*SIERRA BASTO, Angel, Collection Apophoretas Menen Xenias and Laos, Luis Angel Arango Library, 1994, which would be expanded, illustrated and edited by [[Oliver Lis]], with the biography of the poet in 2009.
*SILVA SILVA, Darius, The man who escaped from Hell, Editorial Good Seed, Bogotá, 1991.

==Dissolution==
The solution was placed according to a newspaper article from the 70's attributed to [[Luis Ernesto Suarez]], about the year 1962, claim that we know is false, because the third Huilense ''Notebook'' that is the [[Angel Sierra Basto]] ''Dimensions'' is the year 1963, as ''Narration of the Living Faces'' of [[Julian Polanía Perez]]. The solution is given almost equal to the group [[Beat Generation|Beat]] and [[beatnik]], in the sixties, immersed in countercultural movements. It could happen in the year 1964, with the departure of [[Gustavo Andrade]] of [[Colombia]] to [[Costa Rica]], hoping some of consecrated as playwright abroad (which succeeded being awarded the prize of the Paris Theatre, among others), or the death of [[Julian Perez Polanía]] in a car accident in 1965.

==''Papelipolas'', The Movie==
In 2013, the writer and filmmaker [[Oliver Lis]] and the Spanish producer [[Blanca Rosa de Aguilar]], began shooting the film ''[[The Papelípolas, Twilight of a Poetic Generation]]'' with the survivors [[Armando Ceron Castillo]] and [[Dario Silva Silva]]. Colombian-French-Spanish production, attended by the former Minister of Justice of Colombia, [[Guillermo Plazas Alcid]], the former governor of Huila, [[Julio Enrique Ortiz]], and the writers [[Jorge Guebely Ortega]] and [[Delimiro Moreno]], as the descendants of the poets. The film is part of what its author called [[Phenomenological Cinema]].

'''''The Pirates of Penzance; or, The Slave of Duty''''' is a [[comic opera]] in two acts, with music by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and [[libretto]] by [[W. S. Gilbert|W.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Gilbert]]. The opera's official premiere was at the [[Fifth Avenue Theatre]] in New York City on 31 December 1879, where the show was well received by both audiences and critics.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Helga. [http://www.savoyoperas.org.uk/pirates/pp2.html Information from the Savoyoperas.org website], Savoy Operas, 27 November 2000, accessed 25 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Its London debut was on 3 April 1880, at the [[Opera Comique]], where it ran for 363 performances, having already been playing successfully for more than three months in New York.

The story concerns Frederic, who, having completed his 21st year, is released from his apprenticeship to a band of tender-hearted pirates. He meets Mabel, the daughter of Major-General Stanley, and the two young people fall instantly in love. Frederic soon learns, however, that he was born on the 29th of February, and so, technically, he has a birthday only once each [[leap year]].  His [[indenture]] specifies that he remain apprenticed to the pirates until his "twenty-first birthday", meaning that he must serve for another 63 years.&lt;ref&gt;This figure assumes that Gilbert was ignoring the fact that there was no leap year in 1900. Otherwise, the action of the play would take place in 1873 instead of 1877, and the figure would be 67 years. See Bradley (1996), p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Bound by his own sense of duty, Frederic's only solace is that Mabel agrees to wait for him faithfully.

''Pirates'' was the fifth [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] collaboration and introduced the much-parodied "[[Major-General's Song]]". The opera was performed for over a century by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] in Britain and by many other opera companies and repertory companies worldwide. Modernized productions include [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1981 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, which ran for 787 performances, winning the [[Tony Award for Best Revival]] and the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical]], and spawning many imitations and a [[The Pirates of Penzance (1983 film)|1983 film adaptation]]. ''Pirates'' remains popular today, taking its place along with ''[[The Mikado]]'' and ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' as one of the most frequently played Gilbert and Sullivan operas.

==Background==
[[File:Joseph Ferdinand Keppler - The Pirate Publisher - Puck Magazine - Restoration by Adam Cuerden.jpg|'' The Pirate Publisher – An International Burlesque that has the Longest Run on Record'', from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', 1886: Gilbert is seen as one of the British authors whose works are stolen by the pirate publisher.|thumb|300px]]
''The Pirates of Penzance'' was the only [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera to have its official premiere in the United States. At the time, American law offered no [[copyright]] protection to foreigners. After the pair's previous opera, ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', achieved success in London in 1878, approximately 150 American companies quickly mounted unauthorised productions that often took considerable liberties with the text and paid no royalties to the creators.&lt;ref name=Prestige&gt;Prestige, Colin. "D'Oyly Carte and the Pirates: The Original New York Productions of Gilbert and Sullivan", pp. 113–48 at p. 118, [http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/handle/1808/5875 Papers Presented at the International Conference of G&amp;S] held at the [[University of Kansas]], May 1970, edited by James Helyar. Lawrence, Kansas: University of Kansas Libraries, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1979), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Andrew.  ''Gilbert and Sullivan at Law'', pp. 204–05, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press (1982), {{ISBN|0838631797}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert and Sullivan hoped to forestall further "copyright piracy" by mounting the first production of their next opera in America, before others could copy it, and by delaying publication of the score and libretto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwardsamuels.com/illustratedstory/isc10.htm International copyright pirating], Edward Samuels, accessed 25 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They succeeded in keeping for themselves the direct profits of the first American production of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' by opening the production themselves on Broadway, prior to the London production, and they also operated profitable US touring companies of ''Pirates'' and ''Pinafore''.&lt;ref name=Prestige/&gt; However, Gilbert, Sullivan, and their producer, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], failed in their efforts, over the next decade, to control the American performance copyrights  to ''Pirates'' and their other operas.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Zvi S. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=963540 "The Twilight of the Opera Pirates: A Prehistory of the Right of Public Performance for Musical Compositions"], ''Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Law Journal'', Vol. 24, 2007, pp. 1157–1218, 5 March 2007, accessed 24 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiction and plays about pirates were ubiquitous in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Cecil, "[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2729/why-are-pirates-depicted-with-a-parrot-on-their-shoulder Why are pirates depicted with a parrot on their shoulder? What's the origin of the skull and crossbones pirate flag?]" ''The Straight Dope'', 12 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Pirate (novel)|The Pirate]]'' (1822) and [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[The Red Rover]]'' were key sources for the romanticised, dashing pirate image and the idea of repentant pirates.&lt;ref name=Williams130&gt;Williams, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Both Gilbert and Sullivan had parodied these ideas early in their careers. Sullivan had written a comic opera called ''[[The Contrabandista]]'', in 1867, about a hapless British tourist who is captured by bandits and forced to become their chief. Gilbert had written several comic works that involved pirates or bandits. In Gilbert's 1876 opera ''[[Princess Toto]]'', the title character is eager to be captured by a brigand chief. Gilbert had translated [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s operetta ''[[Les brigands]]'', in 1871.&lt;ref name=Williams130/&gt; As in ''Les brigands'', ''The Pirates of Penzance'' absurdly treats stealing as a professional career path, with apprentices and tools of the trade such as the crowbar and [[Club (weapon)#Types|life preserver]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genesis===
While ''Pinafore'' was running strongly at the [[Opera Comique]] in London, Gilbert was eager to get started on his and Sullivan's next opera, and he began working on the libretto in December 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; He re-used several elements of his 1870 one-act piece, ''[[Our Island Home]]'', which had introduced a pirate "chief", Captain Bang. Bang was mistakenly apprenticed to a pirate band as a child by his deaf nursemaid. Also, Bang, like Frederic in ''The Pirates of Penzance'', had never seen a woman before and felt a keen sense of duty, as an apprenticed pirate, until the passage of his twenty-first birthday freed him from his articles of indenture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eaton Faning|Faning, Eaton]] and [[Shapcott Wensley]]. Extra Supplement: ''Our Island Home'' in ''Musical Times'', Vol. 55, No. 859 (1 September 1914), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] believed that Gilbert drew on ideas in ''[[Les brigands]]'' for his new libretto, including the businesslike bandits and the bumbling police.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (Vol. 1), p. 784.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert and Sullivan also inserted into Act II an idea they first considered for a one-act opera parody in 1876 about burglars meeting police, while their conflict escapes the notice of the oblivious father of a large family of girls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1879/08/01/80694429.pdf "A Talk With Mr. Sullivan"], ''The New York Times'', 1 August 1879, p. 3, accessed 22 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As in ''Pinafore'', "there was a wordful self-descriptive set-piece for Stanley ["[[The Major-General's Song]]"], introducing himself much as Sir Joseph Porter had done ... a lugubrious comic number for the Sergeant of Police ... a song of confession for Ruth, the successor [to] Little Buttercup", romantic material for Frederic and Mabel, and "ensemble and chorus music in turn pretty, parodic and atmospheric."&lt;ref name=ORC&gt;Gänzl, Kurt.

Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte met by 24 April 1879 to make plans for a production of ''Pinafore'' and the new opera in America.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Carte travelled to New York in the summer of 1879 and made arrangements with theatre manager [[John T. Ford]]&lt;ref&gt;Ford had been one of the few managers who had paid Gilbert and Sullivan any kind of fee for performing ''Pinafore'' in America, and his reward for a small gesture was great (Stedman, p. 169).&lt;/ref&gt; to present, at the [[Fifth Avenue Theatre]], the authorised productions.  He then returned to London.&lt;ref name=Ainger169&gt;Ainger, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, once ''Pinafore'' became a hit in London, the author, composer and producer had the financial resources to produce future shows themselves, and they executed a plan to free themselves from their financial backers in the "Comedy Opera Company". Carte formed a new partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan to divide profits equally among themselves after the expenses of each of their shows.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan gave notice to the directors of the Comedy Opera Company in early July 1879 that he, Gilbert and Carte would not be renewing their contract to produce ''Pinafore'' with them and that he would withdraw his music from the Comedy Opera Company on 31 July.  This followed a closure of the Opera Comique for repairs that Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte used to give them an argument that the original run of the production had "closed". See Stedman, pp. 170–72; Ainger, pp. 165–67 and 194–95; and Jacobs, p. 126. Sullivan wrote to a former producer, [[John Hollingshead]] of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], saying: "You once settled a precedent for me which may just at present be of great importance to me. I asked you for the band parts of the ''Merry Wives of Windsor'' ... and [you] said, 'They are yours, as our run is over....' Now will you please let me have them, and the parts of ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'' also at once. I am detaining the parts of ''Pinafore'', so that the directors shall not take them away from the [[Opera Comique|Comique]] tomorrow, and I base my claim on the precedent ''you'' set." See Rees, p. 89. The Comedy Opera Company directors engaged another theatre to play a rival production of ''Pinafore'', but they had no scenery. On 31 July, they sent a group of thugs to the Opera Comique to seize the scenery and props during the evening performance of ''Pinafore''. See Ainger, p. 170 and Jacobs, pp. 124–25. Stagehands and cast members managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery. The police arrived to restore order, and the show continued. See Stedman, pp. 170–71 and Gillan, Don.

See also "The Fracas at the Opera Comique", ''The Era'', 10 August 1879, p. 5 and "The Fracas at the Opera Comique", ''The Leeds Mercury'', 13 August 1879, p. 8. The matter was eventually settled in court, where a judge ruled in Carte's favour about two years later. See Ainger, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1879, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte sailed to America with a company of strong singers, to play both ''Pinafore'' and the new opera, including [[J. H. Ryley]] as Sir Joseph, [[Blanche Roosevelt]] as Josephine, [[Alice Barnett]] as Little Buttercup, [[Furneaux Cook]] as Dick Deadeye, [[Hugh Talbot]] as Ralph Rackstraw and [[Jessie Bond]] as Cousin Hebe, some of whom had been in the ''Pinafore'' cast in London.&lt;ref name=Jacobs129&gt;Jacobs, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; To these, he added some American singers, including [[Signor Brocolini]] as Captain Corcoran.&lt;ref name=Ainger182&gt;Ainger, pp. 182–83&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Cellier]] came to assist Sullivan, while his brother [[François Cellier|François]] remained in London to conduct ''Pinafore'' there.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert and Sullivan chose talented actors who were not well-known stars, and so they did not command high fees. They then tailored their operas to the particular abilities of these performers.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 111; Ainger, pp. 133–34&lt;/ref&gt; The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience: as critic [[Herman Klein]] wrote, "we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [the Gilbertian quips and absurdities] were said and done. For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings&amp;nbsp;.... [They] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert acted as stage director for his own plays and operas. He sought [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] in acting, which was unusual at the time, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes.&lt;ref&gt;Cox-Ife, William.

[[File:PiratesPenzance1879.gif|thumb|left|upright|Poster for the [[copyright performance]] at Paignton]]
The composition of the music for ''Pirates'' was unusual, in that Sullivan wrote the music for the acts in reverse, intending to bring the completed Act&amp;nbsp;II with him to New York, with Act I existing only in sketches. When he arrived in New York, however, he found that he had left the sketches behind, and he had to reconstruct the first act from memory.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert told a correspondent many years later that Sullivan was unable to recall his setting of the entrance of the women's chorus, so they substituted the chorus "Climbing over rocky mountain" from their earlier opera, ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's manuscript for ''Pirates'' contains pages removed from a ''Thespis'' score, with the vocal parts of this chorus altered from their original arrangement as a four-part chorus. Some scholars (e.g. Tillett and Spencer, 2000) have suggested that Gilbert and Sullivan had planned all along to re-use "Climbing over rocky mountain," and perhaps other parts of ''Thespis''. They argue that Sullivan's having the unpublished ''Thespis'' score in New York, when there were no plans to revive ''Thespis'', might not have been accidental. In any case, on 10 December 1879, Sullivan wrote a letter to his mother about the new opera, upon which he was hard at work in New York. "I think it will be a great success, for it is exquisitely funny, and the music is strikingly tuneful and catching."&lt;ref name=Jacobs129/&gt; As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the [[overture]] for the last moment, sketching it out and entrusting its composition to the company's music director, in this case Alfred Cellier.&lt;ref name=Ainger157/&gt;

''Pinafore'' opened in New York on 1 December 1879 and ran for the rest of December. After a reasonably strong first week, audiences quickly fell off, since most New Yorkers had already seen local productions of ''Pinafore''.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; This was unexpected and forced Gilbert and Sullivan to race to complete and rehearse their new opera, ''The Pirates of Penzance''.&lt;ref name=Jacobs129/&gt; The work's title is a multi-layered joke. On the one hand, [[Penzance]] was a docile seaside resort in 1879, and not the place where one would expect to encounter pirates.&lt;ref&gt;From medieval times and in later centuries, however, Penzance was subject to frequent raiding by Turkish pirates, according to ''Canon Diggens Archive'' 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the title was also a jab at the theatrical "pirates" who had staged unlicensed productions of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' in America.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, Gary. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/7877394/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html "Title Deed: How the Book Got its Name"]. ''The Telegraph'', 7 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; To secure the British [[copyright]],&lt;ref&gt;Performances had to be given in Britain before publication in order to secure copyright.  See Stephens, John Russell. ''The Profession of the Playwright: British Theatre 1800–1900'', Cambridge University Press (1992), pp. 104–15&lt;/ref&gt; a D'Oyly Carte touring company gave a perfunctory [[copyright performance]] of ''Pirates'' the afternoon before the New York premiere, at the Royal Bijou Theatre in [[Paignton]], Devon, organised by [[Helen Lenoir]], who would later marry Richard D'Oyly Carte. The cast, which was performing ''Pinafore'' in the evenings in [[Torquay]], received some of the music for ''Pirates'' only two days beforehand. Having had only one rehearsal, they travelled to nearby Paignton for the matinee, where they read their parts from scripts carried onto the stage, making do with whatever costumes they had on hand.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 180–81&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pirates'' opened on 31 December 1879 in New York and was an immediate hit.&lt;ref name=Jacobs129/&gt; On 2 January 1880, Sullivan wrote, in another letter to his mother from New York, "The libretto is ingenious, clever, wonderfully funny in parts, and sometimes brilliant in dialogue – beautifully written for music, as is all Gilbert does. ... The music is infinitely superior in every way to the ''Pinafore'' – 'tunier' and more developed, of a higher class altogether. I think that in time it will be very popular."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing ''Pirates'' and ''Pinafore''.&lt;ref name=Ainger182/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stedman175&gt;Stedman, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's prediction was correct. After a strong run in New York and several American tours, ''Pirates'' opened in London on 3 April 1880, running for 363 performances there.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (1982), pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; It remains one of the most popular G&amp;S works.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Tim.

The biographer Michael Ainger, however, doubts that Gilbert intended a caricature of Wolseley, identifying instead General Henry Turner, uncle of Gilbert's wife, as the pattern for the "modern Major-General". Gilbert disliked Turner, who, unlike the progressive Wolseley, was of the old school of officers. Nevertheless, in the original London production, [[George Grossmith]] imitated Wolseley's mannerisms and appearance, particularly his large moustache, and the audience recognised the allusion. Wolseley himself, according to his biographer, took no offence at the caricature&lt;ref&gt;See Ainger, pp. 181–82, and Kochanski, Halik.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Marion Hood as Mabel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Marion Hood]]: "Yes, 'tis Mabel!"]]
;Act I
On the coast of [[Cornwall]], during [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign, Frederic celebrates the completion of his twenty-first year and the end of his apprenticeship to a gentlemanly band of pirates ("Pour, oh pour the pirate sherry"). The pirates' maid of all work, Ruth, appears and reveals that, as Frederic's nursemaid long ago, she made a mistake "through being hard of hearing": Mishearing Frederic's father's instructions, she apprenticed him to a pirate, instead of to a ship's ''[[Maritime pilot|pilot]]'' ("When Frederic was a little lad").

Frederic has never seen any woman other than Ruth, and he believes her to be beautiful. The pirates know better and suggest that Frederic take Ruth with him when he returns to civilisation. Frederic announces that, although it pains him, so strong is his sense of duty that, once free from his apprenticeship, he will be forced to devote himself to the pirates' extermination. He also points out that they are not successful pirates: since they are all orphans, they allow their prey to go free if they too are orphans. Frederic notes that word of this has got about, so captured ships' companies routinely claim to be orphans. Frederic invites the pirates to give up piracy and go with him, so that he need not destroy them, but the Pirate King says that, compared with respectability, piracy is comparatively honest ("Oh! better far to live and die"). The pirates depart, leaving Frederic and Ruth. Frederic sees a group of beautiful young girls approaching the pirate lair, and realises that Ruth misled him about her appearance ("Oh false one! You have deceived me!"). Sending Ruth away, Frederic hides before the girls arrive.

[[File:Power as Frederic.jpg|thumb|[[Sir George Power, 7th Baronet|George Power]], the original Frederic in London|right|upright]]
The girls burst exuberantly upon the secluded spot ("Climbing over rocky mountain"). Frederic reveals himself ("Stop, ladies, pray!"), startling them. He appeals to them to help him reform ("Oh! is there not one maiden breast?"). The girls are fascinated by him, but all reject him, except one: Mabel, responds to his plea, chiding her sisters for their lack of charity ("Oh sisters deaf to pity's name for shame!"). She offers Frederic her pity ("Poor wand'ring one"), and the two quickly fall in love. The other girls discuss whether to eavesdrop or to leave the new couple alone ("What ought we to do?"), deciding to "talk about the weather," although they steal glances at the affectionate couple ("How beautifully blue the sky").

Frederic warns the young ladies that his old associates will soon return ("Stay, we must not lose our senses"), but before they can flee, the pirates arrive and capture the girls, intending to marry them ("Here's a first rate opportunity"). Mabel warns the pirates that the girls' father is a Major-General ("Hold, monsters!"), who soon arrives and introduces himself ("[[Major-General's Song|I am the very model of a modern Major-General]]"). He appeals to the pirates not to take his daughters, leaving him to face his old age alone. Having heard of the famous Pirates of Penzance, he pretends that he is an orphan to elicit their sympathy ("Oh, men of dark and dismal fate"). The soft-hearted pirates release the girls ("Hail, Poetry!"), making Major-General Stanley and his daughters honorary members of their band ("Pray observe the magnanimity").

;Act II
The Major-General sits in a ruined chapel on his estate, surrounded by his daughters. His conscience is tortured by the lie that he told the pirates, and the girls attempt to console him ("Oh dry the glist'ning tear"). The Sergeant of Police and his corps arrive to announce their readiness to arrest the pirates ("When the foeman bares his steel"). The girls loudly express their admiration of the police for facing likely slaughter at the hands of fierce and merciless foes. The police are unnerved by this but finally leave.

[[File:1919paradox.jpg|left|thumb|250px|"Have mercy on us!"]]
Left alone, Frederic, who is to lead the police, reflects on his opportunity to atone for a life of piracy ("Now for the pirate's lair"), at which point he encounters Ruth and the Pirate King. They have realised that Frederic's apprenticeship was worded so as to bind him to them until his twenty-first ''birthday'' – and, because that birthday happens to be on the 29th of February (in a [[leap year]]), it means that [[Quibble (plot device)|technically]] only five birthdays have passed ("When you had left our pirate fold"), and he will not reach his twenty-first birthday until he is in his eighties. Frederic is convinced by this logic and agrees to rejoin the pirates.  He then sees it as his duty to inform the Pirate King of the Major-General's deception. The outraged outlaw declares that the pirates' "revenge will be swift and terrible" ("Away, away, my heart's on fire").

Frederic meets Mabel ("All is prepared"), and she pleads with him to stay ("Stay Frederic, stay"), but he feels bound by his duty to the pirates until his 21st birthday – in 1940. They agree to be faithful to each other until then, though to Mabel "It seems so long" ("Oh here is love and here is truth"); Frederic departs. Mabel steels herself ("No, I'll be brave") and tells the police that they must go alone to face the pirates. They muse that an outlaw might be just like any other man, and it is a shame to deprive him of "that liberty which is so dear to all" ("When a felon's not engaged in his employment"). The police hide on hearing the approach of the pirates ("A rollicking band of pirates we"), who have stolen onto the estate, intending to avenge themselves for the Major-General's lie ("With cat-like tread").

Just then, Major-General Stanley appears, sleepless with guilt, and the pirates also hide ("Hush, hush! not a word"), while the Major-General listens to the soothing breeze ("Sighing softly to the river"). The girls come looking for him ("Now what is this and what is that"). The pirates leap to the attack, and the police rush to the defence; but the police are easily defeated, and the Pirate King urges the captured Major-General to prepare for death. The Sergeant has one stratagem left: he demands that the pirates yield "in Queen Victoria's name"; the pirates, overcome with loyalty to their Queen, do so. Ruth appears and reveals that the pirates are "all noblemen who have gone wrong". The Major-General is impressed by this and all is forgiven. Frederic and Mabel are reunited, and the Major-General is happy to marry his daughters to the noble pirates after all.

==Critical reception==
The notices from critics were generally excellent in both New York and London in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;The London theatrical newspaper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' even gave the ''ad hoc'' performance in Paignton a good review: see "Gilbert and Sullivan's New Opera", ''The Era'', 4 January 1880, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, the ''[[New York Herald|Herald]]'' and the ''[[New York Tribune|Tribune]]'' both dedicated considerable space to their reviews. The ''Herald'' took the view that "the new work is in every respect superior to the ''Pinafore'', the text more humorous, the music more elegant and more elaborate."&lt;ref&gt;"The Pirates of Penzance", ''The Daily News'', 15 January 1880, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tribune'' called it "a brilliant and complete success", commenting, "The humor of the ''Pirates'' is richer, but more recondite. It demands a closer attention to the words [but] there are great stores of wit and drollery ... which will well repay exploration. ... The music is fresh, bright, elegant and merry, and much of it belongs to a higher order of art than the most popular of the tunes of ''Pinafore''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1880-01-01/ed-1/seq-5/ "The Pirates of Penzance"]. ''New York Tribune'', 1 January 1880, accessed 27 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' also praised the work, writing, "it would be impossible for a confirmed misanthrope to refrain from merriment over it", though the paper doubted if ''Pirates'' could repeat the prodigious success of ''Pinafore''.&lt;ref name=NYTrev/&gt;

After the London premiere, the critical consensus, led by the theatrical newspaper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', was that the new work marked a distinct advance on Gilbert and Sullivan's earlier works.&lt;ref name=Comiquerev/&gt; ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'' said, "Of Mr. Sullivan's music we must speak in detail on some other occasion. Suffice it for the present to say that in the new style which he has marked out for himself it is the best he has written."&lt;ref name=pmg&gt;"The Pirates of Penzance", ''The Pall Mall Gazette'', 6 April 1880, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Graphic]]'' wrote:
{{quote|That no composer can meet the requirements of Mr. Gilbert like Mr. Sullivan, and ''vice versa'', is a fact universally admitted. One might fancy that verse and music were of simultaneous growth, so closely and firmly are they interwoven. Away from this consideration, the score of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' is one upon which Mr. Sullivan must have bestowed earnest consideration, for independently of its constant flow of melody, it is written throughout for voices and instruments with infinite care, and the issue is a cabinet miniature of exquisitely defined proportions. … That ''the Pirates'' is a clear advance upon its precursors, from ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' to ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', cannot be denied; it contains more variety, marked character, careful workmanship, and is in fact a more finished artistic achievement … a brilliant success.&lt;ref&gt;"Music", ''The Graphic'', 10 April 1880, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

There were a few dissenting comments: ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' thought both author and composer had drawn on the works of their predecessors: "Mr. Gilbert ... seems to have borrowed an idea from [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]]'s ''[[The Critic (play)|The Critic]]''; Mr. Sullivan's music is sprightly, tuneful and full of 'go', although it is certainly lacking in originality."&lt;ref&gt;"From Our London Correspondent", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 5 April 1880, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sporting Times]]'' noted, "It doesn't appear to have struck any of the critics yet that the central idea in ''The Pirates of Penzance'' is taken from ''Our Island Home'', which was played by the [[German Reed Entertainment|German Reeds]] some ten years ago."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sporting Times'', 10 April 1880, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' thought Gilbert's wit outran his dramatic invention, and Sullivan's music for the new work was not quite as good as his score for ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', which the ''Times'' critic called a masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 April 1880, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical analysis==
The overture to ''The Pirates of Penzance'' was composed by Sullivan and his musical assistant [[Alfred Cellier]]. It follows the pattern of most [[Savoy opera]] overtures: a lively opening (the melody of "With cat-like tread"), a slow middle section ("Ah, leave me not to pine alone"), and a concluding [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|allegro]] in a compressed [[sonata form]], in which the themes of "How beautifully blue the sky" and "A paradox, a paradox" are combined.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

The score parodies several composers, most conspicuously [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]. "Come, friends, who plough the sea" and "You triumph now" are burlesques of ''[[Il trovatore]]'',&lt;ref name=hulme&gt;Hulme, David Russell. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/O005334 "The Pirates of Penzance"]. ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera'', Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 30 June 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the best-known choral passages from the finale to Act&amp;nbsp;I, "Hail Poetry", is, according to the Sullivan scholar, [[Arthur Jacobs]], a burlesque of the prayer scene, "La Vergine degli Angeli", in Verdi's ''[[La forza del destino]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; However, another musicologist, Nicholas Temperley, writes, "The choral outburst 'Hail, Poetry' in ''The Pirates of Penzance'' would need very little alteration to turn it into a [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] string quartet."&lt;ref&gt;Temperley, Nicholas. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/732768 "Mozart's Influence on English Music"]. ''Music &amp; Letters'', October 1961, pp. 307–18, Oxford University Press, accessed 1 July 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known parody number from the work is the song for [[coloratura]], "Poor wand'ring one", which is generally thought to burlesque [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s waltz-songs,&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; though the music critic of ''The Times'' called it "mock-[[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Guthrie's Irreverent Pirates", ''The Times'', 16 February 1962, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- I'VE SEEN IT COMPARED WITH "SEMPRE LIBERA". IS THERE ANY MENTION OF THAT? --&gt; In a scene in Act&amp;nbsp;II, Mabel addresses the police, who chant their response in the manner of an [[Anglican]] church service.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. [https://archive.is/20120912003426/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/music/review-23440103-these-pirates-have-real-swagger.do "These pirates have real swagger"]. ''[[Evening Standard]]'', 20 February 2008, accessed 2 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan even managed to parody two composers at once. The critic [[Rodney Milnes]] describes the Major-General's Act&amp;nbsp;II song, "Sighing softly to the river", "as plainly inspired by – and indeed worthy of – Sullivan's hero [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]",&lt;ref name=rodders&gt;"Putting the Jolly in Roger", ''The Times'', 26 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amanda Holden (writer)|Amanda Holden]] speaks of the song's "Schubertian water-rippling accompaniment", but adds that it simultaneously spoofs Verdi's ''Il trovatore'', with the soloist unaware of a concealed male chorus singing behind him.&lt;ref&gt;Holden, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patter, counterpoint, and vocal writing===
{{listen|type=music|filename=Major-General's Song.ogg|title=Major-General's Song|description=[[George Baker (record singer)|George Baker]] sings the ''Major-General's Song'' with the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], conducted by [[Malcolm Sargent]] (1929)}}
Writing about [[patter song]]s, Shaw, in his capacity as a music critic, praised "the time-honored lilt which Sir Arthur Sullivan, following the example of Mozart and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], chose for the lists of accomplishments of the Major-General in The Pirates or the Colonel in [[Patience (opera)|Patience]]."&lt;!--SPELLING AND LACK OF ITALICS ARE AS GBS WROTE THEM. GBS WAS A FERVENT ADVOCATE OF SPELLING REFORM AND HIS OWN WRITING REFLECTED THAT. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (Vol. 2) p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

This opera contains two well-known examples of Sullivan's characteristic combination of two seemingly disparate melodies. Jacobs suggests that [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[La damnation de Faust]]'', a great favourite in Sullivan's formative years, may have been the model for Sullivan's trademark contrapuntal mingling of the rapid prattle of the women's chorus in Act I ("How beautifully blue the sky") in 2/4 time with the lovers' duet in waltz time. Jacobs writes that "the whole number [shifts] with Schubertian ease from B to G and back again."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/27100 "Sullivan, Sir Arthur."] Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, accessed 30 June 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Act II, a double chorus combines the policemen's dogged tune, "When the foeman bares his steel" and the soaring line for the women, "Go, ye heroes, go to glory".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; In adapting the four-part chorus "Climbing over rocky mountain" from ''Thespis'' for re-use in ''Pirates'', Sullivan took less trouble: he wrote only a single vocal line, suitable for soprano voices.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the number ends with another example of Sullivan's counterpoint, with the chorus singing the second melody of the piece ("Let us gaily tread the measure") while the orchestra plays the first ("Climbing over rocky mountain").&lt;ref&gt;Rees, pp. 62–63 suggested that in the original ''Thespis'' version, for male as well as female voices, the men would have sung the first theme while the women sang the second.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan set a particular vocal challenge for the soprano who portrays Mabel. The Sullivan scholar [[Gervase Hughes]] wrote, "Mabel ... ''must'' be a coloratura because of 'Poor wand'ring one!', yet 'Dear father, why leave your bed' demands steady beauty of tone throughout the octave F to F, and 'Ah, leave me not to pine' goes a third lower still."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Music of Arthur Sullivan'' (1959), Hughes quoted four extracts from ''Pirates'', saying that if hearing each out of context one might attribute it to Schubert, [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], Gounod or [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]] respectively, "yet on learning the truth one would kick oneself for not having recognised Sullivan's touch in all four." Hughes concluded by quoting the introductory bars of "When a felon's not engaged in his employment", adding, "There could never be any doubt as to who wrote ''that'', and it is as English as our wonderful police themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
[[File:pirates of penzance restoration.jpg|thumb|200px|right|1880 poster]]
Because the work was premiered in three different places (the Paignton performance and the full productions in New York and London), there are more variations in the early libretto and score of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' than in other Gilbert and Sullivan works. Songs sent from New York to the D'Oyly Carte touring company in England for the Paignton premiere were then altered or omitted during Broadway rehearsals. Gilbert and Sullivan trimmed the work for the London premiere, and Gilbert made further alterations up to and including the 1908 Savoy revival. For example, early versions depicted the Pirate King as the servant of the pirate band,&lt;ref name=brad&gt;Bradley (1982) pp. 90–159&lt;/ref&gt; and the words of the opening chorus were, "Pour, O King, the pirate sherry".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson W. R., Changes in the "Pirates". ''Gramophone'', June 1950, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In the original New York production the revelation by Ruth that the pirates are "all noblemen who have gone wrong" prompted the following exchange (recalling a famous passage in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]''):
{|
|-
|GENERAL, POLICE &amp; GIRLS:||What, all noblemen?
|-
|KING &amp; PIRATES:||Yes, ''all'' noblemen!
|-
|GENERAL, POLICE &amp; GIRLS:||What, all?
|-
|KING:||Well, nearly all!
|}
{|
|-
|valign=top|ALL:
| . . . They are nearly all noblemen who have gone wrong.
:Then give three cheers, both loud and strong,
:For the twenty noblemen who have gone wrong....
|}

In the original London production, this exchange was shortened to the following:
{|
|-
|GIRLS:||Oh spare them! They are all noblemen who have gone wrong.
|-
|GENERAL:||What, all noblemen?
|-
|KING:||Yes, ''all'' noblemen!
|-
|GENERAL:||What, all?
|-
|KING:||Well, nearly all!
|}

Gilbert deleted the exchange in the 1900 revival, and the [[Chappell &amp; Co.|Chappell]] vocal score was revised accordingly. For the 1908 revival Gilbert had the pirates yielding "in good King Edward's name".&lt;ref name=brad/&gt; Despite [[Helen Carte]]'s repeated urging, Gilbert did not prepare an authorised version of the libretti of the [[Savoy operas]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (1982), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 1989 production, the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] restored one of the original versions of the finale, which finishes with a variation of "I am the very model of a modern major-general", rather than with the customary reprise of "Poor wand'ring one",&lt;ref&gt;See Bradley (1982), pp. 158–59&lt;/ref&gt; but in later revivals, it reverted to the more familiar text.&lt;ref name=rodders/&gt;

==Production history==
[[File:SulksPir.jpg|right|thumb|200px|1881 programme cover]]
''The Pirates of Penzance'' has been one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular comic operas. After its unique triple opening in 1879–80, it was revived in London at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1888 and in 1900, and for the Savoy's repertory season of 1908–09. In the British provinces, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company toured it almost continuously from 1880–1884, and again in 1888. It re-entered the D'Oyly Carte touring repertory in 1893 and was never again absent until the company's closure in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 11, 18, 22, 35 ''et passim''&lt;/ref&gt; New costumes were designed by [[Percy Anderson]] in 1919 and [[George Sheringham]] in 1929 (who also executed a new Act I set). [[Peter Goffin]] created a new touring set in 1957.&lt;ref name=rwApp/&gt;

In America, after the New York opening on New Year's Eve, 1879, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] launched four companies that covered the United States on tours that lasted through the following summer.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (1982), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert and Sullivan themselves trained each of the touring companies through January and early February 1880, and each company's first performance – whether it was in Philadelphia, Newark, or Buffalo – was conducted by the composer. In Australia, its first authorised performance was on 19 March 1881 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, produced by [[J. C. Williamson]].&lt;ref name=ORC/&gt; There was still no international copyright law in 1880, and the first ''unauthorised'' New York production was given by the [[Boston Ideal Opera Company]] at Booth's Theatre in September of that year.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The opera premiered in a German translation by [[Richard Genée]] and [[Camillo Walzel]] (''Die Piraten'') in Austria at the [[Theater an der Wien]] on 1 March 1889, and in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany, on 1 December 1936.&lt;ref name=ORC/&gt;

The first non-D'Oyly Carte professional production in a country that had been subject to Gilbert's copyright (other than Williamsons' authorised productions) was in [[Stratford, Ontario]], Canada, in September 1961. In 1979, the [[Torbay]] branch of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society presented a centenary tribute to the world premiere performance of ''Pirates'' in Paignton, with a production at the Palace Avenue Theatre (situated a few metres from the former Bijou Theatre).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilbertandsullivantorbay.co.uk/pirates79.htm "''The Pirates of Penzance''"], The Gilbert and Sullivan Society (Torbay Branch), accessed 23 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pirates-of-penzance-DVDcover.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Rex Smith|Smith]], [[Linda Ronstadt|Ronstadt]] and [[Kevin Kline|Kline]] at the [[Delacorte Theatre]]]]
In 1980, [[Joseph Papp]] and the [[Public Theater]] of New York City produced a new version of ''Pirates'', directed by [[Wilford Leach]] and choreographed by [[Graciela Daniele]], at the [[Delacorte Theatre]] in [[Central Park]], one of the series of annual [[Shakespeare in the Park]] summer events. Musical direction and arrangements were by William Elliott. The show played for 10 previews and 35 performances. It then transferred to Broadway, opening on 8 January 1981 for a run of 20 previews and 787 regular performances at the [[George Gershwin Theatre|Uris]] and [[Minskoff Theatre|Minskoff]] Theatres. This take on ''Pirates'' earned enthusiastic reviews&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Rich|Rich, Frank]].

Compared with traditional productions of the opera, Papp's ''Pirates'' featured a more swashbuckling Pirate King and Frederic, and a broader, more [[musical comedy]] style of singing and humour. It did not significantly change the libretto, but it used a new orchestration and arrangements that changed some keys, added repeats, lengthened dance music and made other minor changes in the score. The "Matter Patter" trio from ''[[Ruddigore]]'' and "Sorry her lot" from ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', two other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, were interpolated into the show.&lt;ref name=ORC/&gt; The production also restored Gilbert and Sullivan's original New York ending, with a reprise of the Major-General's song in the Act II finale. [[Linda Ronstadt]] starred as Mabel, [[Rex Smith]] as Frederic, [[Kevin Kline]] as the Pirate King, [[Patricia Routledge]] as Ruth (replaced by [[Estelle Parsons]] for the Broadway transfer), [[George Rose (actor)|George Rose]] as the Major-General, and [[Tony Azito]] as the Sergeant of Police. Kline won a Tony Award for his performance. Smith won a [[Theatre World Award]], and Kline and Azito won Drama Desk Awards. Notable replacements during the Broadway run included [[Karla DeVito]], [[Maureen McGovern]] and [[Pam Dawber]] as Mabel; [[Robby Benson]], [[Patrick Cassidy (actor)|Patrick Cassidy]] and [[Peter Noone]] as Frederic; [[Treat Williams]], [[Gary Sandy]], [[James Belushi]] and [[Wally Kurth]] as the Pirate King; [[David Garrison]] as the Sergeant; [[George S. Irving]] as the Major-General; and [[Kaye Ballard]] as Ruth. The Los Angeles cast of the production featured [[Barry Bostwick]] as the Pirate King, [[Jo Anne Worley]] as Ruth, [[Clive Revill]] as the Major-General, Dawber as Mabel, [[Paxton Whitehead]] as the Sergeant, [[Caroline Peyton]] as Edith and [[Andy Gibb]] as Frederic.&lt;ref name=IBDB/&gt;
The production opened at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], London, on 26 May 1982, to generally warm reviews, for a run of 601 performances. Notable among the cast were [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] and [[Ronald Fraser (actor)|Ronald Fraser]] as the Major-General; [[Pamela Stephenson]] as Mabel; [[Michael Praed]] and Peter Noone as Frederic; [[Tim Curry]], [[Timothy Bentinck]], [[Oliver Tobias]] and [[Paul Nicholas]] as the Pirate King; [[Chris Langham]] as the Sergeant of Police; [[Annie Ross]] as Ruth; [[Bonnie Langford]] as Kate; and [[Louise Gold]] as Isabel.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Theatre Record]]'', 19 May 1982 to 2 June 1982, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Opera Australia's Pirates of Penzance.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Opera Australia]]'s 2007 touring production of ''Pirates'', with [[Anthony Warlow]] as the Pirate King]]
The Australian production opened in Melbourne in January 1984, opening the new [[Victorian Arts Centre]], directed by John Feraro. It starred [[Jon English]] as the Pirate King, [[Simon Gallaher]] as Frederic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://essgee.com/html/Simon/Simon%20intro.html Simon Gallaher], Essgee.com, accessed 25 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[June Bronhill]] as Ruth, [[David Atkins]] as the Sergeant of Police and [[Marina Prior]] as Mabel. The six-week limited season was followed by an Australian national tour from 1984 to 1986 and another come-back tour with same cast in the mid-1990s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} In 1985, ''Pirates'' opened the new [[Queensland Performing Arts Centre]] in Brisbane, setting attendance records that were not surpassed until many years later by ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The Papp version also inspired foreign-language productions in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref name=ORC/&gt;

The Papp production was turned into [[The Pirates of Penzance (1983 film)|a film in 1983]], with the original Broadway principal cast reprising their roles, except that [[Angela Lansbury]] replaced Estelle Parsons as Ruth. The minor roles used British actors miming to their Broadway counterparts. The film has been shown occasionally on television. Another film based loosely on the opera and inspired by the success of the Papp version, ''[[The Pirate Movie]]'', was released during the Broadway run.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/narrfilm.htm "The G&amp;S Operas on Film"]. ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'', 3 September 2008, accessed 2 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Papp production design has been widely imitated in other modern productions of ''Pirates'', even where traditional orchestration and the standard score are used. The designs and musical arrangements created for the Papp production are protected by copyright; an unlicensed 1982 production mounted in Dublin in advance of Papp's own London production was enjoined from transferring to London by a successful lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;Bennetts, Leslie. [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/18/movies/pirating-of-the-pirates-of-penzance.html "Pirating of ''The Pirates of Penzance''"], ''The New York Times'', 18 August 1982, accessed 11 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern productions are also influenced by the Disney film franchise ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'', combining aspects of the Papp production with the Disney design concepts. Not all of these revivals have generated the same enthusiasm as Papp's 1980s productions. A 1999 UK touring production received this critique: "No doubt when Papp first staged this show in New York and London it had some quality of cheek or chutzpah or pizzazz or irony or something that accounted for its success. But all that's left now ... is a crass Broadway-style musical arrangement ground out by a seven-piece band, and the worst kind of smutty send-up of a historic piece of art."&lt;ref&gt;McMillan, Joyce.

==Recordings==
''The Pirates of Penzance'' has been recorded many times, and the critical consensus is that it has fared well on record.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Lamb, Andrew]]. "The Pirates of Penzance", ''Gramophone'', November 1993, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete recording of the score was in 1921, under the direction of [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]], but with established recording singers rather than D'Oyly Carte Opera Company performers.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. x&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'' said of a new set with a mainly D'Oyly Carte cast, "This new recording represents the high-water mark so far as Gilbert and Sullivan opera is concerned. In each of the previous Savoy albums there have been occasional lapses which prevented one from awarding them unqualified praise; but with the ''Pirates'' it is happily otherwise; from first to last, and in every bar, a simply delightful production."&lt;ref&gt;''The Gramophone'', September 1929, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Of later recordings by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, the 1968 recording (with complete dialogue) is highly regarded: The online ''Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'' says, "This recording is one of the best D'Oyly Carte sets of all time, and certainly the best ''Pirates''",&lt;ref name=disco&gt;Shepherd, Marc.

''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'', 7 September 2008, accessed 30 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Penguin Guide to Opera on Compact Disc'' also recommends it.&lt;ref&gt;March (1993), pp. 437–38&lt;/ref&gt; So too does the ''Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music'', alongside the 1993 [[Charles Mackerras|Mackerras]] recording.&lt;ref&gt;March (2007), p. 1338&lt;/ref&gt; The opera critic [[Alan Blyth]] recommended the D'Oyly Carte recording of 1990: "a performance full of the kind of life that can only come from the experience of stage performances".&lt;ref&gt;Blyth, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The online ''Discography'' site also mentions the 1981 Papp recording as "excellent", despite its inauthentic 1980 re-orchestrations that "changed some of the timbres so as to appeal to a rock-oriented public".&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc.

Other songs, from ''Pirates'', ''Pinafore'' and ''[[Ruddigore]]'', are also parodied in the recording&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'' version in the episode "The Cold Open" (2006), where the cast performs "We'll be the very model of a modern network TV show";&lt;ref name=Studio&gt;Schillinger, Liesl: [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/22/theater/22schi.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1 "Dress British, Sing Yiddish"] ''The New York Times'', 22 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'' video game version, where the character [[Mordin Solus]] sings: "I am the very model of a scientist Salarian".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-HgVM6JSIY "''Mass Effect 2'' Mordin Singing"], YouTube, 23 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is often used in film and on television, unchanged in many instances, as a character's audition piece, or seen in a "school play" scene.

Other film references to ''Pirates'' include ''[[Kate &amp; Leopold]]'', where there are multiple references, including a scene where Leopold sings "I Am The Very Model of A Modern Major-General" while accompanying himself on the piano; and in ''[[Pretty Woman]]'', Edward Lewis ([[Richard Gere]]) covers a social gaffe by prostitute Vivian Ward ([[Julia Roberts]]), who comments that the opera ''[[La traviata]]'' was so good that she almost "peed [her] pants", by saying that she had said that she liked it better than ''The Pirates of Penzance''". In [[Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney's]] cartoon ''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]'' (2004), there is a performance of ''Pirates'' that becomes the setting for the climactic battle between the Musketeers and [[Pete (Disney)|Captain Pete]]. ''Pirates'' songs sung in the cartoon are "With cat-like tread", "Poor wand'ring one", "Climbing over rocky mountain" and the Major-General's song. "Poor wand'ring one" was used in the movie ''[[An American Tail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090633/soundtrack "Soundtrack for ''An American Tail'' (1986)"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29714">This is a timeline of the [[feminist art movement]] in [[New Zealand]] (or Aotearoa/New Zealand as it is often known in inclusive circles). It lists important figures, collectives, publications, exhibitions and moments that have contributed to discussion and development of the movement. For the indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]] population, the emergence of the [[feminist art movement]] broadly coincided with the emergence of [[Māori Renaissance]].

'''1982'''

The [[F1 Sculpture Project]] is staged in a large disused factory building on Tory Street in Wellington. A significant number of female artists make temporary installation pieces and a range of events were staged, including a two-day Women Sculptors Seminar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factory 1 (F1) Sculpture Project 1982|url=http://thecommunityarchive.org.nz/node/65922/description|website=The Community Archive|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strathdee|first1=Barbara|title=Women Artists at the F1 New Zealand Sculpture Project|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Autumn 1983|issue=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1983'''

The national art magazine ''Art New Zealand'' dedicates its Autumn issue to female artists and the women's art movement. Art historian [[Cheryll Sotheran]] writes an overview of the current state and reception of women's art in New Zealand, noting  that 'most critics in New Zealand avoid or condemn exhibitions of women's art which use gender difference as a political weapon. The women whose art receives favourable reviews (or in many cases any reviews at all) are those whose work fits the modernist mould, are not feminists, are asexual and apolitical.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sotheran|first1=Cheryll|title=Replacing Women in Art History|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues21to30/replacing.htm|website=Art New Zealand|accessdate=21 February 2016|date=Autumn 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haeata, the Māori women’s art collective, is established in Wellington. Members include [[Keri Kaa]], [[Patricia Grace]], [[Robyn Kahukiwa]] and [[Irihapeti Ramsden]]. It supports a number of significant female Māori artists and produces and tours exhibitions.&lt;ref name ='Cull'/&gt;

[[Bronwynne Cornish]] is commissioned by the [[Auckland Art Gallery]] to produce a solo work and creates a multi-part ceramic installation titled ''Dedicated to the Kindness of Mothers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Eastmond | first1=Elizabeth | title=Bronwynne Cornish's 'Dedicated to the kindness of mothers' | journal=Art New Zealand | date=Autumn 1984 | issue=30|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues21to30/cornish.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In April, [[Gretchen Albrecht]] selects work for a group exhibition arranged by the Outreach Gallery in Auckland,  ''New Works By Women''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosier|first1=Pat|title=New Works By Women, 1983|journal=Broadsheet|date=June 1983|issue=110|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, Juliet Batten facilitates ''The Menstrual Maze'' at Greer's Factory in Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=Bronwen|title=The Menstrual Maze|journal=Broadsheet|date=September 1983|issue=112|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The June issue of feminist magazine ''Broadsheet'' includes a special feature on feminist artists. It includes Batten's article 'What is a feminist artist?'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Batten|first1=Juliet|title=What is a feminist artist?|journal=Broadsheet|date=June 1983|issue=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadsheet 110, June 1983: 'Special feature on feminist art'|url=http://best-of-3.blogspot.co.nz/2016/03/broadsheet-110-june-1983-special.html|website=Best of 3|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1983 also sees the founding of [[Aotearoa Moananui a Kiwa Weavers]], a government funding stream specific to female-dominated art forms, Māori and Pacific weaving. It is now known as [[Te Roopu Raranga Whatu o Aotearoa]] and Māori-only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maoriart.org.nz/weavers-c-52_75.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304153600/http://www.maoriart.org.nz/weavers-c-52_75.html |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1984'''

[[Robyn Kahukiwa]] exhibits her series of paintings ''Wahine toa: women of Māori myth''; the paintings are also reproduced in a book with text by [[Patricia Grace]].&lt;ref name='Mane-Wheoki'/&gt;

'''1985'''

Artist Juliet Batten leads the 'One Hundred Women' event at [[Te Henga (Bethells Beach)]] as part of the ANZART project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barton|first1=Christina|title=Post-object and conceptual art - What is post-object art|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/43823/one-hundred-women|website=Te Ara - The online encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1986'''

The journal ''Antic'' is launched. Art historian [[Tina Barton]] describes it as 'one forum for a more analytical explication of feminist theory and its applications in the field of literature, criticism and the visual arts, which could be seen as an alternative to the ''Broadsheet'' or ''Art New Zealand'' models.' It ceases publication in 1990.&lt;ref name ='Barton 1993'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barton|first1=Christina|title=Ten Years On: Reviewing the terrain for women in art in New Zealand|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Spring 1993|issue=68|pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antic 1986 - 1990: full list of contents|url=http://best-of-3.blogspot.co.nz/2016/03/antic-1986-1990-full-list-of-contents.html|website=Best of 3|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
===Season 1===
Five Years after the events of ''[[Transformers Prime Beast Hunters: Predacons Rising|Predacons Rising]]'', [[Cybertron]]'s beginning brings forth a new age of prosperity to a new generation of Transformers. [[Earth]] no longer remembers the [[Decepticon]]-[[Autobot]] conflict as the Cybertronians stopped visiting the planet. [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] has since become a seasoned Cybertronian [[police officer]] and despite his fame, he chooses to be a humble peacekeeper. Things change when he is summoned by the vision of [[Optimus Prime]]. Thought to be long dead after restoring Cybertron's population, Optimus Prime calls for Bumblebee to return to Earth as a new threat appears.

With the help of [[Sideswipe (Transformers)|Sideswipe]] (a rebel "bad boy bot") and Strongarm (an Elite Guard cadet partnered to him), the trio makes it to [[Earth]] to discover a crashed maximum security prison ship called the ''Alchemor'' and its [[Steward (office)|steward]] Fixit (a hyperactive [[Mini-Con]] with faulty wiring). They soon learn the ''Alchemor'' had "a couple hundred" Decepticon prisoners within Stasis Pods, but all of its inmates have escaped. It is now their duty to recapture all the escaped Decepticon prisoners before they cause further harm on Earth. With the aid of humans Russell and Denny Clay and the [[Dinobot]] [[Grimlock]] (who was a prisoner of Alchemor for committing property damage before siding with Bumblebee), Bumblebee leads this unlikely team to protect Earth from the Decepticon prisoners led by Steeljaw and restore order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/transformers-prime-39/transformers-robots-in-disguise-cartoon-launching-spring-2015-180311/|title=Transformers: Robots in Disguise Cartoon Launching Spring 2015|author=StayingInTheBox|work=TFW2005.com|date=June 28, 2014|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steeljaw]] even forms his own group fellow Decepticon prisoners like the metal-eating Underbite, crime boss Thunderhoof, stranded bounty hunter Fracture, Fracture's Mini-Con partners Airazor and Divebomb, and cowardly informant Clampdown.

The Autobots are later joined with the likes of Autobot bounty hunter Drift, his Mini-Con partners Slipstream and Jetstorm, the female warrior Windblade, and the return of Optimus Prime in the wake of the arrival of [[Fallen (Transformers)|Megatronus]], who was the one that crashed the Alchemor (and subsequently freed Steeljaw and his pack and later blackmailed Steeljaw into helping him escape his imprisonment) and who the [[Thirteen (Transformers)|Thirteen Primes]] have been preparing Optimus for. During the battle Bumblebee, Sideswipe, and Strongarm realize they can combine their Decepticon hunters together and become more powerful. After a lengthy battle, the Autobots manage to pin Megatronus under the right arm of the Crown City Colossus statue. Bumblebee, Sideswipe, and Strongarm combine the power from their Decepticon hunters and unleash a massive beam of energy that is powerful enough to blast Megatronus to dust. As Steeljaw had been blasted away by Megatronus, the Autobots were able to capture Underbite, Thunderhoof, Fracture, and Clampdown. Just as the Autobots are about to leave, Bumblebee orders his team to "Rev up and Roll out!", finally finding his perfect rallying cry. Back at the Scrapyard, Bumblebee asks his team if they would like to stay on Earth. One by one, each Autobot states why they would like to stay on Earth. Optimus Prime also agrees to stay on Earth, but he notes that he will only do so as Bumblebee's equal rather than as his leader to which Bumblebee agrees.

===Season 2===
Weeks after the defeat of The Fallen, the Autobots continue to deal with the threat of the Decepticon fugitives that are still on Earth. While Steeljaw is still at large, he eventually discovers another group of Decepticons stationed on the crashed remains of a second half of the ''Alchemor'' that is dubbed "Decepticon Island" led by Glowstrike, [[Scorponok]], and Saberhorn. As Optimus is weakened when the immense power he was lent from the Primes is drained by them, the Autobots split into two teams: an Away Team led by Optimus Prime and another team that remains at their scrapyard base. Along the way, the Autobots run into a strange occurrence in the form of Decepticon criminals who are not listed in the ''Alchemor'' prisoner manifest yet have criminal records on Cybertron. Steeljaw even proved himself to the "Decepticon Island" faction by not only freeing Thunderhoof and Clampdown, but also freeing the prisoners Bisk, Groundpounder, Overload, Quillfire, and Springload to be his "elite warriors."

During this period of time, Optimus slowly recovers his strength and teaches the Away team (Drift and his Mini-Con students, Sideswipe, and Windblade) valuable lessons about teamwork. Fixit eventually repairs the GroundBridge following an explosion that occurred after he originally dispatched the Away Team, but a malfunction allowed [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] (who was trapped in the Shadowzone as seen in the Season 3 finale of ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'') to escape, but his stay was short-lived and attempt to contact Megatron was thwarted as Team Bee put him back in.

As the two Autobot teams are reunited, they pair up with the Autobot [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] and his Mini-Con Undertone and find the rest of the Decepticons in "Decepticon Island". The Autobots come up with a plan: infiltrate the base so they could place and activate a Stasis Bomb which would place ALL Decepticons within its range in stasis. Thanks to Sideswipe and Strongarm, who disabled the restrictor collars worn by the enslaved Caretaker Mini-Cons, Fixit leads his brethren into coming to Bumblebee and Optimus's aid in defeating Steeljaw, helping to ensure that all Autobots and Mini-Cons escape the ship and ensuring that the plan succeeds, which it does. In the wake of their victory, Optimus Prime, Ratchet, Windblade, and the Caretaker Mini-Cons repair the ship to be returned to Cybertron, as Bumblebee and the team reside on Earth.

===Season 3 Prologue===
Following the events of the "Decepticon Island" battle, a group of Decepticon Scavengers arrive on Earth looking for relics from the Great War; they have been partnered with Weaponizer Mini-Cons, a breed of Mini-Cons who can control the bodies of their wielder. At the same time, [[Starscream]] makes an unexpected return following the events of "Predacons Rising" with the help of a trio of bounty hunters (Shadelock, RoughEdge, and Razorhorn). Starscream seeks the Dark Star Saber and the Weaponizer Mini-Cons in a plot to rebuild the Decepticon Empire and kill Megatron as revenge for all of the abuse he inflicted upon him. Upon learning the truth from the Mini-Con Sawtooth, the Weaponizers then abandon the Scavengers and later ally themselves with the Autobots. The Autobots are successful in defeating the Scavengers and the bounty hunters, and eventually Starscream as well. With the day saved, Optimus Prime loads all of the Decepticons onto his ship along with the Dark Star Saber before leaving to hand them over to the Cybertronian Authorities. The Weaponizers thank the Autobots for saving them and then they leave in their Sub-Orbital Craft (which Fixit both fixed and modified for space travel) with the intent of "going where they will never be found".&lt;ref name="tformers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tformers.com/sdcc-2016-starscream-and-steve-blum-to-invade-robots-in-disguise-cartoon/29712/news.html|title=SDCC 2016 - Starscream and Steve Blum to Invade Robots in Disguise Cartoon Transformers News Reviews Movies Comics and Toys|first=|last=Tformers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 3: Combiner Force===
Sometime after their victory against Starscream and the Scavengers, Team Bee begins crossing paths with the [[Stunticons]], a group of Decepticons consisting of Motormaster, Dragstrip, Slashmark, Heatseeker, and Wildbreak who can combine into Menasor. In order to combat this, the Autobots need to combine themselves into Ultra Bee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.unicron.com/2017-transformers/rid/4882-menasor-team-consists-of-dragstrip,-heatseeker,-motormaster,-slashmark,-wildbreak.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Stunticons' defeat, Optimus Prime has them and several other Decepticons that have been captured recently stored away in his ship so he could return them to Cybertron. He also enlists Drift and his Mini-Con students to accompany him for a special mission. At the same time, Soundwave is working to escape from the Shadowzone with the help of some Activator Mini-Con allies. Also, Steeljaw, Underbite, Thunderhoof, Quillfire, and Clampdown return where they are tasked with capturing Bumblebee's team for their mysterious benefactors on Cybertron who arranged for them to be pardoned of their respective crimes. Soundwave eventually gets free from the Shadowzone and is also revealed to be allied with Steeljaw's mysterious benefactors, but he is defeated by Team Bee before he could activate a beacon that would try to summon Megatron and taken back to Cybertron by Optimus Prime to stand trial. It is soon discovered that Steeljaw and Soundwave's benefactors are the members of the Autobot High Council who are actually Decepticon infiltrators (consisting of Cyclonus, Cyberwarp, Riotgear, Skyjack, and Treadshock) who have plans to invade Earth. When Ultra Bee defeats their combined form of Galvatronus, the Autobots restore order to Cybertron as a formation of a new Autobot High Council is underway.

The series was originally planned to premiere on what was known as the [[Discovery Family|Hub Network]] (a joint venture between [[Hasbro]] and [[Discovery Communications]]).&lt;ref name="disguise"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.hasbro.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=861485|title=Hasbro Returns to Comic-Con International, Showcasing Top Entertainment Brands|work=hasbro.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208095755/http://investor.hasbro.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=861485|archivedate=2015-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on October 7, 2014, just days before the channel's re-branding as [[Discovery Family]] that took place on October 13, it was announced that the series would premiere on [[Cartoon Network]] instead. Hasbro Studios president Stephen Davis felt that Cartoon Network was a more appropriate home for a ''Transformers'' series due to its male-oriented demographics, having felt that Hub Network had been skewed towards girls. Previous animated ''Transformers'' series had also aired on Cartoon Network prior to the launch of the joint venture and Hasbro Studios.&lt;ref name="To CN Hasb Press"/&gt;&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;&lt;ref name="To CN D Holl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adweek-df"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/after-rocky-few-years-hasbro-s-tv-strategy-changing-again-163083|title=The Rise and Fall and Rise of Hasbro's TV Strategy|last=Thielman|first=Sam|work=Adweek|date=February 23, 2015|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese''', also known as '''Sinitic''',{{efn|From Late Latin ''{{linktext|Sinae}}'' "the Chinese". In 1982, [[Paul K. Benedict]] proposed a subgroup of Sino-Tibetan called "Sinitic" comprising [[Bai language|Bai]] and Chinese.{{sfnp|Wang|2005|p=107}} The precise affiliation of Bai remains uncertain,{{sfnp|Wang|2005|p=122}} but the term "Sinitic" is usually used as a synonym for Chinese, especially when viewed as a language family.{{sfnp|Mair|1991|p=3}}}} is a branch of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language family]] consisting of hundreds of local [[variety (linguistics)|language varieties]], many of which are not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. The differences are similar to those within the [[Romance languages]], with variation particularly strong in the more mountainous southeast.  These varieties, often called "dialects", have been classified into seven to ten groups, the largest being [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] (e.g. [[Beijing dialect]]), [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] (e.g. [[Shanghainese]]), [[Min Chinese|Min]] (e.g. [[Hokkien]]), and [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] (e.g. [[Cantonese]]).

[[Chinese language|Chinese]] varieties differ most in their [[phonology]], and to a lesser extent in [[vocabulary]] and [[syntax]]. Southern varieties tend to have fewer initial consonants than northern and central varieties, but more often preserve the [[Middle Chinese]] final consonants. All have phonemic [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], with northern varieties tending to have fewer distinctions than southern ones. Many have [[tone sandhi]], with the most complex patterns in the coastal area from [[Zhejiang]] to eastern [[Guangdong]].

[[Standard Chinese]] takes its phonology from the Beijing dialect, with vocabulary from the Mandarin group and grammar based on literature in the [[written vernacular Chinese|modern written vernacular]].  It is the sole [[official language]] of both [[China]] and [[Taiwan]], one of the [[Languages of Singapore|four official languages]] of [[Singapore]], and one of the [[Official languages of the United Nations|six official languages]] of the [[United Nations]].

== History ==
At the end of the 2nd millennium BC, a form of Chinese was spoken in a compact area around the lower [[Wei River]] and middle [[Yellow River]].
From there it expanded eastwards across the [[North China Plain]] to [[Shandong]] and then south into the valley of the [[Yangtze River]] and beyond to the hills of south China.
As the language spread, it replaced formerly dominant languages in those areas, and regional differences grew.
Simultaneously, especially in periods of political unity, there was a tendency to promote a central standard to facilitate communication between people from different regions.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=183, 185}}

The first evidence of dialectal variation is found in texts from the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722–479 BC).  At that time, the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] royal domain, though no longer politically powerful, still defined standard speech.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=183}}
The ''[[Fangyan]]'' (early 1st century AD) is devoted to differences in vocabulary between regions.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=185}}
Commentaries from the [[Eastern Han]] period (first two centuries AD) contain much discussion of local variations in pronunciation.
The ''[[Qieyun]]'' [[rime dictionary|rhyme book]] (601 AD) noted wide variation in pronunciation between regions, and set out to define a standard pronunciation for reading the classics.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=116–117}}
This standard, known as [[Middle Chinese]], is believed to be a [[diasystem]] based on the reading traditions of northern and southern capitals.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=24–25}}

The [[North China Plain]] provided few barriers to migration, leading to relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area in northern China. In contrast, the mountains and rivers of southern China have spawned the other six major groups of Chinese languages, with great internal diversity, particularly in [[Fujian]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=183–190}}{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=22}}

=== Standard Chinese ===
{{main|Standard Chinese}}
Until the mid-20th century, most Chinese people spoke only their local language.
As a practical measure, officials of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|common language based on Mandarin varieties]], known as ''Guānhuà'' (官話, literally "speech of officials").
Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}

In the early years of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], [[Literary Chinese]] was replaced as the written standard by [[written vernacular Chinese]], which was based on northern dialects.
In the 1930s a [[Standard Chinese|standard national language]] was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the [[Beijing dialect]], but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=3–15}}
It is the official spoken language of the [[People's Republic of China]] and of the [[Republic of China]] governing Taiwan, and one of the official languages of [[Singapore]].

Standard Mandarin Chinese now dominates public life in mainland China, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=247}} Outside China and Taiwan, the only varieties of Chinese commonly taught in university courses are Standard Mandarin and [[Cantonese]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=187}}

=== Comparison with Europe ===
Chinese has been likened to the [[Romance languages]] of Europe, the modern descendents of [[Latin language|Latin]].
In both cases, the ancestral language was spread by imperial expansion over [[substrate language]]s 2000 years ago, by the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]]–[[Han dynasty|Han]] empire in China and the [[Roman Empire]] in Europe.
In [[Western Europe]], [[Medieval Latin]] remained the standard for scholarly and administrative writing for centuries, and influenced local varieties, as did [[Literary Chinese]] in China.
In both Europe and China, local forms of speech diverged from the written standard and from each other, producing extensive [[dialect continua]], with widely separated varieties being mutually unintelligible.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=187}}{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=7}}

On the other hand, there are major differences.
In China, political unity was restored in the late 6th century (by the [[Sui dynasty]]) and has persisted (with interludes of division) until the present day.
Meanwhile, Europe remained fragmented and developed numerous independent states.
Vernacular writing, facilitated by the alphabet, supplanted Latin, and these states developed their own [[standard language]]s.
In China, however, Literary Chinese maintained its monopoly on formal writing until the start of the 20th century.
The [[logographic]] writing, read with varying local pronunciations, continued to serve as a source of vocabulary and idioms for the local varieties.
The new national standard, [[Vernacular Chinese]], the written counterpart of spoken Standard Chinese, is also used as a literary form by speakers of all varieties.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=2–3}}{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=16–18}}

==Classification==
{{See also|List of varieties of Chinese}}
Dialectologist [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] estimated that there are hundreds of mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese.{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=72}} These varieties form a [[dialect continuum]], in which differences in speech generally become more pronounced as distances increase, although there are also some sharp boundaries.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=189–190}} However, the rate of change in mutual intelligibility varies immensely depending on region. For example, the varieties of Mandarin spoken in all three northeastern Chinese provinces are mutually intelligible, but in the province of [[Fujian]], where [[Min Chinese|Min varieties]] predominate, the speech of neighbouring counties or even villages may be mutually unintelligible.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=188}}

Classifications of Chinese varieties in the late 19th century and early 20th century were based on impressionistic criteria. They often followed river systems, which were historically the main routes of migration and communication in southern China.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=36–41}} The first scientific classifications, based primarily on the evolution of [[Middle Chinese]] voiced initials, were produced by [[Wang Li (linguist)|Wang Li]] in 1936 and [[Li Fang-Kuei]] in 1937, with minor modifications by other linguists since.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=41–53}} The conventionally accepted set of seven dialect groups first appeared in the second edition of [[Yuan Jiahua]]'s dialectology handbook (1961):{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=181}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=53–55}}

;[[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]
:This is the group spoken in northern and southwestern China and has by far the most speakers.  This group includes the [[Beijing dialect]], which forms the basis for [[Standard Chinese]], called ''Putonghua'' or ''Guoyu'' in Chinese, and often also translated as "Mandarin" or simply "Chinese".  In addition, the [[Dungan language]] of [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] is a Mandarin variety written in the [[Cyrillic script]].
;[[Wu Chinese|Wu]]
:These varieties are spoken in [[Shanghai]], most of [[Zhejiang]] and the southern parts of [[Jiangsu]] and [[Anhui]].  The group comprises hundreds of distinct spoken forms, many of which are not mutually intelligible.  The [[Suzhou dialect]] is usually taken as representative, because [[Shanghainese]] features several atypical innovations.{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=90}} Wu varieties are distinguished by their retention of voiced or murmured [[obstruent]] initials ([[stop consonant|stops]], [[affricate consonant|affricates]] and [[fricative consonant|fricatives]]).{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=199–200}}
;[[Gan Chinese|Gan]]
:These varieties are spoken in [[Jiangxi]] and neighbouring areas. The [[Nanchang dialect]] is taken as representative.  In the past, Gan was viewed as closely related to [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] because of the way Middle Chinese voiced initials became voiceless aspirated initials as in Hakka, and were hence called by the umbrella term "Hakka–Gan dialects".{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=46, 49–50}}{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=148}}
;[[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]]
:The Xiang varieties are spoken in [[Hunan]] and southern [[Hubei]]. The [[New Xiang]] varieties, represented by the [[Changsha dialect]], have been significantly influenced by Southwest Mandarin, whereas [[Old Xiang]] varieties, represented by the [[Shuangfeng dialect]], retain features such as voiced initials.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=207–209}}
;[[Min Chinese|Min]]
:These varieties originated in the mountainous terrain of [[Fujian]] and eastern [[Guangdong]], and form the only branch of Chinese that cannot be directly derived from [[Middle Chinese]].  It is also the most diverse, with many of the varieties used in neighbouring counties—and, in the mountains of western Fujian, even in adjacent villages—being mutually unintelligible.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=188}}  Early classifications divided Min into Northern and Southern subgroups, but a survey in the early 1960s found that the primary split was between inland and coastal groups.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=49}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=233}}  Varieties from the coastal region around [[Xiamen]] have spread to Southeast Asia, where they are known as [[Hokkien]], and Taiwan, where they are known as [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=232–233}}  Other offshoots of Min are found in [[Hainan]] and the [[Leizhou Peninsula]], with smaller communities throughout southern China.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=233}}
;[[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]
:The [[Hakka people|Hakka]] (literally "guest families") are a group of [[Han Chinese]] living in the hills of northeastern Guangdong, southwestern Fujian and many other parts of southern China, as well as [[Taiwan]] and parts of Southeast Asia such as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. The [[Meixian dialect]] is the prestige form.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=224}}  Most Hakka varieties retain the full complement of nasal endings, -m -n -ŋ and stop endings -p -t -k, though there is a tendency for Middle Chinese velar codas -ŋ and -k to yield dental codas -n and -t after front vowels.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=217}}
;[[Yue Chinese|Yue]]
:These varieties are spoken in [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], and have been carried by immigrants to Southeast Asia and many other parts of the world. The [[prestige variety]] is [[Cantonese]], from the city of [[Guangzhou]], which is also the native language of the majority in Hong Kong and Macau.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=215}} [[Taishanese]], from the coastal area of Jiangmen southwest of Guangzhou, was historically the most common Yue variety among overseas communities in the West until the late 20th century.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=98}}  Not all Yue varieties are mutually intelligible.  Most Yue varieties retain the full complement of Middle Chinese word-final consonants (p, t, k, m, n and ŋ) and have rich inventories of tones.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=217}}

The ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987) follows a classification of [[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]], distinguishing three further groups:{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=55–56}}
;[[Jin Chinese|Jin]]
:These varieties, spoken in [[Shanxi]] and adjacent areas, were formerly included in Mandarin.  They are distinguished by their retention of the Middle Chinese [[entering tone]] category.{{sfnp|Yan|2006|pp=60–61}}
;[[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]]
:The Hui dialects, spoken in southern [[Anhui]], share different features with Wu, Gan and Mandarin, making them difficult to classify.  Earlier scholars had assigned to them one or other of these groups, or to a group of their own.{{sfnp|Yan|2006|pp=222–223}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=43–44, 48, 69, 75–76}}
;[[Pinghua]]
:These varieties are descended from the speech of the earliest Chinese migrants to [[Guangxi]], predating the later influx of Yue and Southwest Mandarin speakers.  Some linguists treat them as a mixture of Yue and Xiang.{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=235}}

Some varieties remain unclassified, including the [[Danzhou dialect]] of northwestern [[Hainan]], [[Waxiang Chinese|Waxiang]], spoken in a small strip of land in western [[Hunan]], and [[Shaozhou Tuhua]], spoken in the border regions of Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=72–73}}
This region is an area of great linguistic diversity but has not yet been conclusively described.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Most of the vocabulary of the [[Bai language]] of [[Yunnan]] appears to be related to Chinese words, though many are clearly loans from the last few centuries.  Some scholars have suggested that it represents a very early branching from Chinese, while others argue that it is a more distantly related [[Sino-Tibetan language]] overlaid with two millennia of loans.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=290–291}}{{sfnp|Norman|2003|pp=73, 75}}{{sfnp|Wang|2005}}

===Relationships between groups===
[[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] classified the traditional seven dialect groups into three larger groups: Northern (Mandarin), Central (Wu, Gan, and Xiang) and Southern (Hakka, Yue, and Min).
He argued that the Southern Group is derived from a standard used in the Yangtze valley during the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD), which he called Old Southern Chinese, while the Central group was transitional between the Northern and Southern groups.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=182–183}}
Some dialect boundaries, such as between Wu and Min, are particularly abrupt, while others, such as between Mandarin and Xiang or between Min and Hakka, are much less clearly defined.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=189–190}}

Scholars account for the transitional nature of the central varieties in terms of [[wave model]]s. Iwata argues that innovations have been transmitted from the north across the [[Huai River]] to the [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]] area and from there southeast to the Wu area and westwards along the [[Yangtze River]] valley and thence to southwestern areas, leaving the hills of the southeast largely untouched.{{sfnp|Iwata|2010|pp=102–108}}

===Quantitative similarity===
A 2007 study compared fifteen major urban dialects on the objective criteria of lexical similarity and regularity of sound correspondences, and subjective criteria of intelligibility and similarity.
Most of these criteria show a top-level split with Northern, [[New Xiang]], and [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] in one group and [[Min Chinese|Min]] (samples at Fuzhou, Xiamen, Chaozhou), [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] in the other group.
The exception was phonological regularity, where the one Gan dialect ([[Nanchang Gan]]) was in the Southern group and very close to Hakka,{{which|date=March 2016}} and the deepest phonological difference was between [[Wenzhounese]] (the southernmost Wu dialect) and all other dialects.{{sfnp|Tang|Van Heuven|2007}}

The study did not find clear splits within the Northern and Central areas:
*Changsha (New Xiang) was always within the Mandarin group. No Old Xiang dialect was in the sample.
*Taiyuan ([[Jin Chinese|Jin]] or Shanxi) and Hankou (Wuhan, Hubei) were subjectively perceived as relatively different from other Northern dialects but were very close in mutual intelligibility. Objectively, Taiyuan had substantial phonological divergence but little lexical divergence.
*Chengdu (Sichuan) was somewhat divergent lexically but very little on the other measures.

The two Wu dialects occupied an intermediate position, closer to the Northern/New Xiang/Gan group in lexical similarity and strongly closer in subjective intelligibility but closer to Min/Hakka/Yue in phonological regularity and subjective similarity, except that Wenzhou was farthest from all other dialects in phonological regularity. The two Wu dialects were close to each other in lexical similarity and subjective similarity but not in mutual intelligibility, where Suzhou was actually closer to Northern/Xiang/Gan than to Wenzhou.

In the Southern subgroup, Hakka and Yue grouped closely together on the three lexical and subjective measures but not in phonological regularity.
The Min dialects showed high divergence, with Min Fuzhou ([[Eastern Min]]) grouped only weakly with the [[Southern Min]] dialects of Xiamen and Chaozhou on the two objective criteria and was actually slightly closer to Hakka and Yue on the subjective criteria.

===Terminology===
Local varieties from different areas of China are often mutually unintelligible, differing at least as much as different [[Romance languages]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=1}}{{sfnp|Mair|2013}}  These varieties form the [[Sinitic languages|Sinitic]] branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family (with [[Bai language|Bai]] sometimes being included in this grouping).{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=73}}  Because speakers share a [[written vernacular Chinese|standard written form]], and have a common cultural heritage with long periods of political unity, the varieties are popularly perceived among native speakers as variants of a single Chinese language,{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=1–2}} and this is also the official position.{{sfnp|Liang|2014|p=14}}  Conventional English-language usage in Chinese linguistics is to use ''dialect'' for the speech of a particular place (regardless of status) while regional groupings like Mandarin and Wu are called ''dialect groups''.{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=72}} [[ISO 639-3]] follows the ''[[Ethnologue]]'' in assigning language codes to eight of the top-level groups listed above (all but Min and Pinghua) and five subgroups of Min.{{sfnp|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2015}} Other linguists choose to refer to the major groupings as languages.{{sfnp|Mair|2013}}

In Chinese, the term ''fāngyán''{{efn|{{lang|zh|方言}} is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''fāng'' {{linktext|方}}, meaning "place, region, area", and ''yán'' {{linktext|言}} meaning "speech, talk, language".  This was the title of the [[Fangyan|first work of Chinese dialectology]] in the [[Han dynasty]], and has had a range of meanings in the millennia since.{{sfnp|Mair|1991|pp=3–6}}}} is used for any regional subdivision of Chinese, from the speech of a village to major branches such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Wu Chinese|Wu]]. Linguists writing in Chinese often qualify the term to distinguish different levels of classification.  All these terms have customarily been translated into English as ''dialect'', a practice that has been criticized as confusing.  The neologisms ''regionalect'' and ''topolect'' have been proposed as alternative renderings of ''fāngyán''.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=57}}{{efn|[[John DeFrancis]] proposed the neologism ''regionalect'' to serve as a translation for ''fāngyán'' when referring to mutually unintelligible divisions.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=57}} [[Victor Mair]] coined the term ''topolect'' as a translation for all uses of ''fāngyán''.{{sfnp|Mair|1991|p=7}} The latter term appears in ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]''.}}

The only varieties usually recognized as languages in their own right are [[Dungan language|Dungan]] and [[Taz language|Taz]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017|reason=Is there any reference for this Taz language?}} This is mostly due to political reasons{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} as they are spoken in the [[former Soviet Union]] and are usually not written in Han characters but in [[Cyrillic]]. Various [[mixed languages]], particularly those spoken by ethnic minorities, are also referred to as languages such as [[Tangwang language]] and [[E language]]. Some people and institutions may also allude to [[Taiwanese language]], [[Cantonese language]], and [[Hakka language]]s. The [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Taiwanese Ministry of Education]] uses the terms "Minnan language" and "Taiwan Minnan language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.moe.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=14780&amp;ctNode=11446&amp;mp=1 | title=Ministry of Education Republic of China (Taiwan)| date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
[[File:Chinese syllable tree.svg|thumb|right|Traditional Chinese syllable structure]]
The usual unit of analysis is the syllable, traditionally analysed as consisting of an initial [[consonant]], a final and a [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=138–139}}
In general, southern varieties have fewer initial consonants than northern and central varieties, but more often preserve the [[Middle Chinese]] final consonants.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=212–213}}
Some varieties, such as [[Cantonese]] and the [[Shanghai dialect]], include syllabic nasals as independent syllables.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=101}}

=== Initials ===
In the 42 varieties surveyed in the ''[[Great Dictionary of Modern Chinese Dialects]]'', the number of initials (including a zero initial) ranges from 15 in some southern dialects to a high of 35 in the dialect of [[Chongming Island]], [[Shanghai]].{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=186–188}}

The initial system of the [[Fuzhou dialect]] of northern [[Fujian]] is a minimal example.{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=127}}
With the exception of {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, which is often merged with the zero initial, the initials of this dialect are present in all Chinese varieties, although several varieties do not distinguish {{IPA|/n/}} from {{IPA|/l/}}.
However, most varieties have additional initials, due to a combination of innovations and retention of distinctions from Middle Chinese:
* Most non-Min varieties have a labio-dental fricative {{IPA|/f/}}, which developed from Middle Chinese bilabial stops in certain environments.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=211, 233}}
* The voiced initials of Middle Chinese are retained in Wu dialects such as Suzhou and [[Shanghai dialect|Shanghai]], as well as [[Old Xiang]] dialects, but have merged with voiceless initials elsewhere.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=199–200, 207}}
* The Middle Chinese retroflex initials are retained in many Mandarin dialects, including Beijing but not southwestern and southeastern Mandarin varieties.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}}
* In many northern and central varieties there is palatalization of dental affricates, velars (as in Suzhou), or both.  In some places, including Beijing, palatalized dental affricates and velars have merged to form a new palatal series.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=182, 193, 200, 205}}

=== Finals ===
Chinese finals may be analysed as an optional medial [[semivowel|glide]], a main vowel and an optional coda.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=28, 141}}

Conservative vowel systems, such as those of Gan dialects, have high vowels {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/y/}}, which also function as medials, mid vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, and a low {{IPA|/a/}}-like vowel.{{sfnp|Yan|2006|pp=150–151}}
In other dialects, including Mandarin dialects, {{IPA|/o/}} has merged with {{IPA|/a/}}, leaving a single mid vowel with a wide range of [[allophone]]s.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=141, 198}}
Many dialects, particularly in northern and central China, have apical or retroflex vowels, which are [[syllabic fricative]]s derived from high vowels following sibilant initials.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=194}}
In many Wu dialects, vowels and final glides have [[monophthong]]ized, producing a rich inventory of vowels in open syllables.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=200–201}}
Reduction of medials is common in Yue dialects.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=216–217}}

The Middle Chinese codas, consisting of glides {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}, nasals {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, and stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}, are best preserved in southern dialects, particularly Yue dialects.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=217}}
In Jin, [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]] and Wu dialects, the stops have merged as a final glottal stop, while in most northern varieties they have disappeared.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=193, 201–202}}
In Mandarin dialects final {{IPA|/m/}} has merged with {{IPA|/n/}}, while some central dialects have a single nasal coda, in some cases realized as a [[nasal vowel|nasalization]] of the vowel.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=193, 201}}

===Tones===
All varieties of Chinese, like neighbouring languages in the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], have phonemic [[tone (linguistics)|tones]].
Each syllable may be pronounced with between three and seven distinct pitch contours, denoting different morphemes.
For example, the [[Beijing dialect]] distinguishes ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|mā}}'' ({{lang|zh-hans|妈}} "mother"), ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|má}}'' ({{lang|zh-hans|麻}} "hemp"), ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|mǎ}}'' ({{lang|zh-hans|马}} "horse") and ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|mà}}'' ({{lang|zh-hans|骂}} "to scold").
The number of tonal contrasts varies between dialects, with northern dialects tending to have fewer distinctions than southern ones.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=9}}
Many dialects have [[tone sandhi]], in which the pitch contour of a syllable is affected by the tones of adjacent syllables in a compound word or phrase.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=147, 202, 239}}
This process is so extensive in [[Shanghainese]] that the tone system is reduced to a [[pitch accent]] system much like modern Japanese.

The tonal categories of modern varieties can be related by considering their derivation from the [[four tones of Middle Chinese]], though cognate tonal categories in different dialects are often realized as quite different pitch contours.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=54}}
Middle Chinese had a three-way tonal contrast in syllables with vocalic or nasal endings.
The traditional names of the tonal categories are "level"/"even" ({{lang|zh-hans|平}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|píng}}''), "rising" ({{lang|zh-hans|上}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|shǎng}}'') and "departing"/"going" ({{lang|zh-hans|去}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|qù}}'').
Syllables ending in a [[stop consonant]] {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}} ([[checked syllable]]s) had no tonal contrasts but were traditionally treated as a fourth tone category, "entering" ({{lang|zh-hans|入}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|rù}}''), corresponding to syllables ending in nasals {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, or {{IPA|/ŋ/}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=34–36}}

The tones of Middle Chinese, as well as similar systems in neighbouring languages, experienced a [[tone split]] conditioned by syllabic onsets.
Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch, and by the late [[Tang Dynasty]], each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials, known as "upper" ({{lang|zh-hans|阴}}/{{lang|zh-hant|陰}} ''yīn'') and "lower" ({{lang|zh-hans|阳}}/{{lang|zh-hant|陽}} ''yáng'').
When voicing was lost in all dialects except the Wu and Old Xiang groups, this distinction became phonemic, yielding eight tonal categories, with a six-way contrast in unchecked syllables and a two-way contrast in checked syllables.
[[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] maintains these tones and has developed an additional distinction in checked syllables as well as one in unchecked syllables. (The latter distinction has disappeared again in many varieties.) However, most Chinese varieties have reduced the number of tonal distinctions. For example, in Mandarin, the tones resulting from the split of Middle Chinese rising and departing tones merged, leaving four tones. Furthermore, final stop consonants disappeared in most Mandarin dialects, and such syllables were distributed amongst the four remaining tones.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=52–54}}

In Wu, voiced obstruents were retained, and the tone split never became phonemic: the higher-pitched allophones occur with initial voiceless consonants, and the lower-pitched allophones occur with initial voiced consonants.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=202}} (Traditional Chinese classification nonetheless counts these as different tones.) Most Wu dialects retain the tone categories of Middle Chinese, but in [[Shanghainese]] several of these have merged.

Many Chinese varieties exhibit [[tone sandhi]], in which the realization of a tone varies depending on the context of the syllable.
For example, in [[Standard Chinese]] a third tone changes to a second tone when followed by another third tone.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=146–147}}
Particularly complex sandhi patterns are found in Wu dialects and coastal Min dialects.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=202, 239}}
In Shanghainese, the tone of all syllables in a word is determined by the tone of the first, so that Shanghainese has word rather than syllable tone.

==Vocabulary==
Most [[morpheme]]s in Chinese varieties are monosyllables descended from [[Old Chinese]] words, and have cognates in all varieties:

Old Chinese had two families of negatives starting with *p- and *m-, respectively.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=97–98}}
Northern and Central varieties tend to use a word from the first family, cognate with Beijing ''pu''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; 不, as the ordinary negator.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=182}}
A word from the second family is used as an existential negator "have not", as in Beijing ''mei''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 沒 and Shanghai ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=196, 200, 204}}
In Mandarin varieties this word is also used for "not yet", whereas in Wu and other groups a different form is typically used.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=196–197, 203–204}}
In Southern varieties, negators tend to come from the second family.
The ordinary negators in these varieties are all derived from a [[syllabic nasal]] *m̩, though it has a level tone in Hakka and Yue and a rising tone in Min.
Existential negators derive from a proto-form *mau, though again the tonal category varies between groups.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=213}}

First- and second-person pronouns are cognate across all varieties.
For third-person pronouns, Jin, Mandarin, and Xiang varieties have cognate forms, but other varieties generally use forms that originally had a velar or glottal initial:{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=182, 214}}

Southern varieties also include distinctive [[stratum (linguistics)|substrata]] of vocabulary of non-Chinese origin.  Some of these words may have come from [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai–Kadai]] and [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] languages.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=17–19, 213–214, 219, 231–232}}

==Examples of variations==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
The [[Min Chinese|Min]] languages are often regarded as furthest removed linguistically from [[Standard Chinese]] in phonology, grammar, and vocabulary. Historically, the Min languages were the first to diverge from the rest of the Chinese languages (see the discussion of [[historical Chinese phonology]] for more details). The Min languages are also the group with the greatest amount of internal diversity and are often regarded as consisting of at least five separate languages, e.g. [[Northern Min]], [[Southern Min]], [[Central Min]], [[Eastern Min]], and [[Puxian Min]].

To illustrate, in [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]] (a variety of [[Hokkien dialect|Hokkien]], a Min language) to express the idea that one is feeling a little ill ("I am not feeling well."), one might say (in [[Pe̍h-oē-jī]])

{{quotation|Goá kā-kī lâng ū tām-po̍h-á bô sóng-khoài.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;我家己人有淡薄無爽快。（我家己人有淡薄无爽快）}}

which, when translated [[cognate]]-by-cognate into Mandarin, would be spoken as an awkward or [[semantic]]ally unrecognizable sentence:

{{quotation|Wǒ jiājǐ rén yǒu dànbó wú shuǎngkuài.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could roughly be interpreted as:&lt;br /&gt;''My family's own person is weakly not feeling refreshed.''}}

Whereas when spoken colloquially in Mandarin, one would either say,

{{quotation|Wǒ zìjǐ yǒu yīdiǎn bù shūfu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;我自己有一點不舒服。（我自己有一点不舒服）&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''I myself feel a bit uncomfortable.''}}

or

{{quotation|Wǒ yǒu yīdiǎn bù shūfu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;我有一點不舒服。（我有一点不舒服）&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''I feel a bit uncomfortable.''}}

the latter omitting the reflexive pronoun (zìjǐ), not usually needed in Mandarin.

Some people, particularly in northern China, would say,

{{quotation|Wǒ yǒu diǎnr bù shūfu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;我有點兒不舒服。（我有点儿不舒服）&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally: ''I am [a] bit[DIM.] uncomfortable.''}}

==Sociolinguistics==

===Bilingualism with the standard variety===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}
In southern China (not including Hong Kong and Macau), where the difference between [[Standard Chinese]] and local dialects is particularly pronounced, well-educated Chinese are generally fluent in Standard Chinese, and most people have at least a good passive knowledge of it, in addition to being native speakers of the local dialect. The choice of dialect varies based on the social situation. Standard Chinese is usually considered more formal and is required when speaking to a person who does not understand the local dialect. The local dialect (be it non-Standard Chinese or non-Mandarin altogether) is generally considered more intimate and is used among close family members and friends and in everyday conversation within the local area. Chinese speakers will frequently [[Code-switching|code switch]] between Standard Chinese and the local dialect. Parents will generally speak to their children in dialect, and the relationship between dialect and Mandarin appears to be mostly stable. Local languages give a sense of identity to local cultures.

Knowing the local dialect is of considerable social benefit, and most Chinese who permanently move to a new area will attempt to pick up the local dialect. Learning a new dialect is usually done informally through a process of immersion and recognizing sound shifts. Generally the differences are more pronounced lexically than grammatically. Typically, a speaker of one dialect of Chinese will need about a year of immersion to understand the local dialect and about three to five years to become fluent in speaking it. Because of the variety of dialects spoken, there are usually few formal methods for learning a local dialect.

Due to the variety in Chinese speech, Mandarin speakers from each area of China are very often prone to fuse or "translate" words from their local language into their Mandarin conversations. In addition, each area of China has its recognizable accents while speaking Mandarin. Generally, the nationalized standard form of Mandarin pronunciation is only heard on news and radio broadcasts. Even in the streets of Beijing, the flavour of Mandarin varies in pronunciation from the Mandarin heard on the media.

===Language policy===
[[File:Standard Chinese promotion school.jpg|thumb|A school in Guangdong with writing "Please speak [[Standard Chinese]]. Please write [[Simplified Chinese|standard characters]]" on the wall.]]

====Chinese Mainland====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}
Within mainland China, there has been a persistent drive towards [[Promotion of Putonghua|promoting the standard language]] (大力推广普通话; ''dàlì tuīguǎng Pǔtōnghuà''); for instance, the education system is entirely Mandarin-medium from the second year onward. However, usage of local dialect is tolerated and socially preferred in many informal situations. In [[Hong Kong]], colloquial Cantonese characters are never used in formal documents other than quoting witnesses' spoken statements during legal trials, and within the PRC a character set closer to Mandarin tends to be used. At the national level, differences in dialect generally do not correspond to political divisions or categories, and this has for the most part prevented dialect from becoming the basis of [[identity politics]]. Historically, many of the people who promoted [[Chinese nationalism]] were from southern China and did not natively speak the national standard language, and even leaders from northern China rarely spoke with the standard accent. For example, [[Mao Zedong]] often emphasized his Hunan origins in speaking, rendering much of what he said incomprehensible to many Chinese. One consequence of this is that China does not have a well-developed tradition of spoken political rhetoric, and most Chinese political works are intended primarily as written works rather than spoken works. Another factor that limits the political implications of dialect is that it is very common within an extended family for different people to know and use different dialects.

====Taiwan====
Before 1945, other than a small [[Japanese people|Japanese]]-speaking population, most of the population of [[Taiwan]] were Han Chinese, who spoke [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] or [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], with a minority of [[Taiwanese aborigines]], who spoke [[Formosan languages]].{{sfnp|Hsieh|2007|pp=12–13}} When the [[Kuomintang]] retreated to the island after losing the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, they brought a substantial influx of speakers of Northern Chinese, and viewed the use of Mandarin as part of their claim to be a legitimate government of the whole of China.{{sfnp|Hsieh|2007|p=15}} Education policy promoted the use of Mandarin over the local languages, and was implemented especially rigidly in elementary schools, with punishments and public humiliation for children using other languages at school.{{sfnp|Hsieh|2007|p=15}} From the 1970s, the government promoted adult education in Mandarin, required Mandarin for official purposes, and encouraged its increased use in broadcasting.{{sfnp|Hsieh|2007|pp=16–17}} Over a 40-year period, these policies succeeded in spreading the use and prestige of Mandarin through society at the expense of the other languages.{{sfnp|Hsieh|2007|p=17}} They also aggravated social divisions, as Mandarin speakers found it difficult to find jobs in private companies but were favoured for government positions.{{sfnp|Hsieh|2007|p=17}} From the 1990s, Taiwanese native languages were offered in elementary and middle schools, first in [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan county]], then in other areas governed by elected [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) politicians, and finally throughout the island.{{sfnp|Hsieh|2007|pp=20–21}}

====Singapore====
{{see also|Languages of Singapore}}
In 1966, the Singaporean government implemented a policy of [[bilingual]] education, where Singaporean students learn both English and their designated native language, which was Mandarin for Chinese Singaporeans. The ''Goh Report'', an evaluation of Singapore's education system by [[Goh Keng Swee]], showed that less than 40% of the student population managed to attain minimum levels of [[Linguistic competence|competency]] in two languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libguides.nl.sg/content.php?pid=57257&amp;sid=449203 'The Goh Report'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002204442/http://libguides.nl.sg/content.php?pid=57257&amp;sid=449203 |date=2 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later determined that the learning of Mandarin among Singaporean Chinese was hindered by home use of other Chinese varieties, such as [[Hokkien]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]].&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Whoa Man-Fat, "[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016073611/http%3A//www3.telus.net/linguisticsissues/singapore.html A Critical Evaluation of Singapore's Language Policy and its Implications for English Teaching]", Karen's Linguistics Issues.

Singapore: Singapore University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the government decided to rectify problems facing implementation of the bilingual education policy, by launching a campaign to promote Mandarin as a common language among the Chinese population, and to discourage use of other Chinese varieties.

Launched in 1979 by then [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | surname = Lee | given = Kuan Yew | title = From Third World to First: The Singapore Story: 1965–2000 | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-06-019776-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the campaign aimed to simplify the language environment for [[Chinese Singaporeans]], improve communication between them, and create a Mandarin-speaking environment conducive to the successful implementation of the bilingual education programme. The initial goal of the campaign was for all young Chinese to stop speaking dialects in five years, and to establish Mandarin as the language of choice in public places within 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Lim Siew Yeen and Jessie Yak, [http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_2013-07-04_122007.html Speak Mandarin Campaign] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140107190852/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_2013-07-04_122007.html |date=7 January 2014 }}, Infopedia, National Library Board Singapore, 4 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} "[http://www.chinaqw.com/hwjy/hjsp/200903/17/155266.shtml 讲华语运动30年 对象随大环境改变]", Hua Sheng Bao, 17 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the government, for the bilingual policy to be effective, Mandarin should be spoken at home and should serve as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among Chinese Singaporeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | surname = Bokhorst-Heng | given = Wendy | chapter = Singapore's ''Speak Mandarin Campaign'': Language ideological debates and the imagining of the nation | pages = 235–265 | title = Language Ideological Debates | editor-given = Jan | editor-surname = Blommaert | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-3-11-016350-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also argued that Mandarin was more economically valuable, and speaking Mandarin would help Chinese Singaporeans retain their heritage, as Mandarin contains a cultural repository of values and traditions that are identifiable to all Chinese, regardless of dialect group.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | given = Lionel | surname = Wee | title = The semiotics of language ideologies in Singapore | journal = Journal of Sociolinguistics | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 344–361 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-6441.2006.00331.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

("Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?")&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Renan, "[[wikisource:fr:Qu’est-ce qu’une nation ?|Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]", conference faite en Sorbonne, le 11 Mars 1882, Accessed January 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; is an 1882 lecture by French historian [[Ernest Renan]] (1823–1892), known for the statements that a nation is "a daily referendum", and that nations are based as much on what the people jointly forget, as what they remember. It is frequently quoted or anthologized in works of history or political science pertaining to [[nationalism]] and [[national identity]]. Renan wrote "What is a Nation" in order to symbolize the nationalism which was born in France as a result of the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Google Books search on "qu'est-ce qu'une nation?" http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Qu%27est-ce+gu%27une+nation&amp;tbs=bks%3A1&amp;tbo=1#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;q=%22Qu%27est-ce+qu%27une+nation%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=5350378400f9f42d Accessed January 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationhood in Renan's time==
Renan begins his essay by noting that there is frequent confusion between the idea of nationhood and of racial or linguistic groupings, a form of confusion which he says can produce "the gravest errors". He promises to conduct an autopsy-like examination, "in an absolutely cold and impartial fashion." 

He claims that nations existing at the time of writing in 1882, such as [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[England]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], will continue to exist for hundreds of years, and that any nation trying to dominate them will be quickly pushed back to its own borders,  by a coalition of other nations; "The establishment of a new Roman or Charlemagnian Empire has become an impossibility. " 

Renan believed that nations developed from the common needs of the people, who consisted of different social groups seeking a "collective identity". He praises the eighteenth century for its achievements in regards to humanity and the restoration of the pure identity of man, one which was free from misconceptions and socially established variances. Renan discredits the theory that race is the basis for the unification of people. It is important to note that France was quite ethnically diverse during the French Revolution and the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte, but it nevertheless managed to set the stage for nationalism. Renan also asserts that neither language nor religion are basis for solidarity because language “invites people to unite, but does not force them to do so” and "religion has become an individual matter" For example, the United States and England both speak English but do not constitute a single, united nation and countries no longer operate on the notion of religions operating against each other, forcing people to choose between one or the other.

Renan noted that a unique element of the European nation-forming experience was the mixture of races, origins and religions, where conquering people often adopted the religion and manners, and married the women, of the people they conquered. He notes that France was quite ethnically diverse during the French Revolution. For example, "at the end of one or two generations, the Norman invaders were indistinguishable from the rest of the population". Nonetheless, they had a profound influence, bringing with them "a nobility of military habit, a patriotism" which did not exist before. -

==Forgetfulness==
Renan then states what has become one of the most famous and enduring ideas of the essay. "Forgetfulness, and I would even say historical error, are essential in the creation of a nation." Historical research, by revealing unwanted truths, can even endanger nationhood. All nations, even the most benevolent in later practice,  are founded on acts of violence, which are then forgotten. "Unity is always achieved by brutality: the joining of the north of France with the center was the result of nearly a century of extermination and terror". He believes that people unite in their memories of suffering because alleviating grief requires a “common effort” which serves as a foundation for unity. Members of a community feel as though they have accomplished something great when they are able to survive in adverse conditions. He gives some examples of countries like [[Turkey]] and [[Bohemia]] where there is rigid stratification, or where different communities are played off against one another, and where the homogenization of different groups could not take place, resulting in a failure of nationhood. This leads to one of the most frequently quoted statements in the essay:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yet the essence of a nation is that all individuals have many things in common, and also that they have forgotten many things. No French citizen knows whether he is a [[Burgundians|Burgundian]], an [[Alans|Alan]], a [[Taifals|Taifale]], or a [[Visigoths|Visigoth]], yet every French citizen has to have forgotten the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|massacre of Saint Bartholomew]], or the [[Albigensian Crusade|massacre]] that took place in the South in the thirteenth century.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Organising principles of nationhood==
While many nations, such as France, begin with a feudal regime such as a monarchy, others, such as the United States and Switzerland, are formed by acts of consensual aggregation. France and many others, however, survived their feudal roots while maintaining their identity. Renan inquires what is the organizing principle? It can't be race, because France is "Celt, Iberian, German....The most noble countries,   England, France and Italy, are the ones where the blood is most mixed." 
Language, by contrast, "invites us but does not force us, to unite". Countries which share the Spanish or English language don't merge with one another, while the people of Switzerland speak several  languages. Modern nationhood also cannot be based on religion, which Renan observes, is currently practiced according to individual belief. "You can be French, English, German, yet Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, or practicing no religion". Mutuality of interests is fine for corporations and their affiliates, but nationality is based on sentiment. Geography merely leads us astray, and often to violence: "Mountains don't know how to carve out countries".

==A "spiritual principle"==
Renan concludes that a nation is

&lt;blockquote&gt; a soul, a spiritual principle. Two things, which are really one, constitute this soul and spiritual principle. One is in the past, the other, the present. One is the possession in common of a rich trove of memories; the other is actual consent, the desire to live together, the will to continue to value the undivided, shared heritage....To have had glorious moments in common in the past, a common will in the present, to have done great things together and to wish to do more, those are the essential conditions for a people. We love the nation in proportion to the sacrifices to which we consented, the harms that we suffered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus the idea of nation is based upon common glories in the past,common will in the present to live together,having performed great deeds together and wish to perform still more for the nation,having future program to put into effect and having suffered, enjoyed and hoped together.

==Continued consent==
{{anchor|Willensnation}}
A very important element of nationhood, says Renan, is the desire to continue forming part of the nation. Renan's second frequently quoted statement is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The existence of a nation (you will pardon me this metaphor) is a daily referendum,&lt;ref&gt;''un plébiscite de tous les jours'', also translated as "daily plebiscite".&lt;/ref&gt; just as the continuing existence of an individual is a perpetual affirmation of life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This leads Renan to the conclusion that "A nation never has a veritable interest in annexing or keeping another region against the wishes of its people". In other words, areas such as states or provinces which wish to secede, should be permitted to do so. "If doubts arise about national borders, consult the population of the area in dispute. They have the right to an opinion on the issue."

Renan concludes that nationhood is not an eternal concept, but changes over time (like everything else in this world). "A European confederation will probably replace the nations of today". At the current time, however, the existence of separate nations serves to guarantee liberty, in a way which would be lost if the whole world served under one law and one master. "Each brings one note to the great concert of humanity..."

Renan gives [[Switzerland]] as a prime example of a nation established by volition (choice, will):
:"Switzerland, so well made, since it was made with the consent of her different parts, numbers three or four languages. There is something in man which is superior to language, namely, the will."&lt;ref&gt;''La Suisse, si bien faite, puisqu'elle a été faite par l'assentiment de ses différentes parties, compte trois ou quatre langues. Il y a dans l'homme quelque chose de supérier à la langue: c'est la volonté.'' cited after Demokratie und Hans Vorländer, ''Transzendenz: Die Begründung politischer Ordnungen'' (2014), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=RcPJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA135  p. 135]&lt;/ref&gt;
Renan's argument was summarized in the German term ''Willensnation'' ("nation-by-volition"),&lt;ref&gt;A related concept of a nation formed by an act of will (''Willensentschluss'') was proposed by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] prior to Renan, in the context of the project of [[German unification]]. Fichte used the term in a different spirit, and its application to the ideal of Renan as exemplified in the Swiss Confederacy dates to the early 20th century. See Andrea Albrecht, ''Kosmopolitismus: Weltbürgerdiskurse in Literatur, Philosophie und Publizistik um 1800'',  Walter de Gruyter, 2005, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=H_z7P_eR-C0C&amp;pg=PA350  p. 350];&lt;!-- source seems to imply that the term "Willensnation" was actually used by Fichte, but this cannot be substantiated. the author probably just means to say that Fichte was harping on will and nation before Renan, but that in Fichte, the national character exists de facto, and the will is needed for political unification of what is already a nation, while in Renan, volition precedes the existence of national character--&gt;

The term became popular to describe the [[Swiss constitution|Swiss political model]] after [[Switzerland during the World Wars|World War I]] and continues to be invoked.&lt;ref&gt;

==Legacy and criticism==

Political historian [[Karl Deutsch]], in a quote sometimes mistakenly attributed to Renan, said that a nation is "a group of people united by a mistaken view about the past and a hatred of their neighbours".&lt;ref&gt;Nationalism and its Alternatives {{ISBN|0-394-43763-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benedict Anderson]]'s 1983 work [[Imagined Communities]], which states that a nation is an "imagined political community", argues that Renan contradicts himself when he says French people must have forgotten the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], yet does not explain what it is. In other words, Renan assumes that all his readers will remember the very massacre he says they have forgotten. Anderson also points out that the reason many French citizens of Renan's time knew anything of these massacres was because they learned of them in state-run schools. Thus, the state itself preserved the knowledge which needed to be forgotten for national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Benedict R. O'G. (1991). Imagined communities: reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism (Revised and extended. ed. London: Verso, 1991) pp.. 199-201. {{ISBN|978-0-86091-546-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1995 book, "For Love of Country: an essay on patriotism and nationalism", Maurizio Viroli called Renan's essay "the most influential late nineteenth-century interpretation of the meaning of nation", because of its focus on the "spiritual principle" as opposed to race, religion or geography.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford:Oxford University Press 1995 p, 159, {{ISBN|0-19-829358-5}} https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8crPCvAaNkC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=%22Qu'est-ce+gu'une+nation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=h14wTfaIFMnVgQfFlPC7Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Accessed January 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors, like [[Joxe Azurmendi]], consider that really there is no such opposition to the reasons based on race, geography, history and so on. They argue that Renan maintains his intellectual background but subtly, i.e. the arguments he explicitly used in "What is a Nation?" are not consistent with his thinking. The concept of "daily plebiscite" would be ambiguous. They argue that the definition is an opportunist idealization and it should be interpreted within the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and in the midst of the dispute concerning the Alsace-Lorraine region.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10301">The '''Workplace Religious Freedom Act (WRFA)''' is a proposed amendment to title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which would limit employers' discretion to decline to accommodate the religious practices of their employees or prospective employees in the United States.

WRFA would amend that part of title VII which is codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j).  In its current form (as of 2013), 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j) forbids discrimination on the basis of religion, including "all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business."  The 2013 version of WRFA would delete the phrase "he is unable," and substitute for it: "the employer is unable, after initiating and engaging in an affirmative and bona fide effort."&lt;ref name="Text of 2013 Bill"&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 3686 (112th): Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2013: Text of Bill|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s3686/text|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, an employer would be required to make a "bona fide effort" to accommodate each religious practice or observance, and would be relieved of this duty only if the employer could prove that the effort resulted in "undue hardship."

WRFA would also add an additional provision, to be codified at 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)(2), further limiting employers' ability to deny accommodations with respect to "the practice of wearing religious clothing or a religious hairstyle, or of taking time off for a religious reason."  In such cases, the employer's proposed choice of accommodation would not be considered reasonable (or lawful) "unless the accommodation removes the conflict between employment requirements and the religious practice of the employee."  In order to refuse accommodation to these categories of religious practices, an employer would be required to meet a stringent definition of undue hardship by showing that "the accommodation imposes a significant difficulty or expense on the conduct of the employer's business."

With these provisions, WRFA expressly attempts to supersede the Supreme Court's decision in ''Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison'', 432 U.S. 63 (1977) (see Section 2, "Findings," para. 3).  In that case, the Supreme Court held that an employer could deny an employee’s request for religious accommodation based on any burden greater than a ''de minimis'' burden on the employer.

WRFA was first introduced in the House of Representatives in 1994 by Jerrold Nadler (D-NY).&lt;ref name="1994 Bill: Overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 5233 (103rd): Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1994|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr5233|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As originally introduced, the proposed 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)(2) would not have been limited to religious clothing, hairstyle and holiday observances.&lt;ref name="1994 Version: Bill Text"&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 5233 (103rd): Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1994: Bill Text|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr5233/text|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington on 2010 reintroduction"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bohn|first=Lauren|title=Workplace Religious Freedom Bill Finds Revived Interest|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/03/workplace-religious-freed_n_561560.html|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post / Religious News Service|date=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was introduced in the Senate in 1999, by Senator John Kerry (D-MA),&lt;ref name="1999 version - Senate - Overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 1668 (106th): Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1999|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/s1668|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2002.&lt;ref name="2002 Version - Senate - Overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2572 (107th): Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2002|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/107/s2572|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator [[Rick Santorum]] (R-PA) introduced the bill again in 2003.&lt;ref name="2003 version - Senate - overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 893 (108th): Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2003|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/108/s893|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, WFRA was once again introduced in the  Senate by Senators Santorum and Kerry, and in the House of Representatives by Representatives [[Mark Souder]] (R-IN), [[Carolyn McCarthy]] (D-NY), [[Bobby Jindal]] (R-LA), and [[Anthony Weiner]] (D-NY).  Other supporters of the bill included Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] (D-NY) and Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] (D-MA).  The bill did not pass either house.  In 2010, the Act was reintroduced in the Senate as the Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2010 (S. 4046).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 4046 (111th): Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2010|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/s4046|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the Act was again reintroduced in the Senate as the Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2013 (S. 3686).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 3686 (112th): Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 2013: Related|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s3686|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In each case, the Act's sponsor was Senator John Kerry (D-MA).  In its various incarnations, the scope of WRFA was narrowed to encompass religious dress, grooming, and holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bohn|first=Lauren|title=Workplace Religious Freedom Bill Finds Revived Interest|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/03/workplace-religious-freed_n_561560.html|publisher=The Huffington Post / Religious News Service|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although WRFA has consistently had supporters in both parties,&lt;ref name="Huffington on 2010 reintroduction" /&gt;  it has yet to pass.

This legislation has garnered the diverse support of various religious groups including, the [[Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations]], the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], the [[National Council of Churches]], the [[North American Council for Muslim Women]], the [[Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the [[Jewish Council for Public Affairs]] ,the [[Council on American Islamic Relations]], [[B'nai B'rith International]],  the [[American Jewish Committee]], [[Agudath Israel of America]], the [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] and other groups.&lt;ref name="Christianity Today - 2008"&gt;{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=Greg|title=Congress Again Considers Workplace Religious Freedom Act|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/februaryweb-only/107-43.0.html|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=Christianity Today / Religious News Service|date=Feb 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jpawrfa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpublicaffairs.org/action/action_iframe/www.e-guana.net/organizationsc341.html?action=printContentItem&amp;orgid=54&amp;typeID=82&amp;itemID=10644 |title=Action Alerts - 20050329 Workplace Religious Freedom Act introduced |publisher=The Jewish Council for Public Affairs |date=March 29, 2005 |author=Reva Price &amp; Ethan Felson |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When first introduced, WRFA was opposed by the [[ACLU]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/religion/frb/16224leg20040602.html ACLU Letter on the Harmful Effect of S. 893, the Workplace Religious Freedom Act, on Critical Personal and Civil Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACLU considered the bill "poorly-written" and argued that it could legalize certain acts of discrimination in the name of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/stop-sneak-attack-your-civil-rights-and-health-care-opposing-workplace-religious-freedom-act |title=Stop a Sneak Attack on Your Civil Rights and Health Care by Opposing the "Workplace Religious Freedom Act" &amp;#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU was also concerned that other employees might be forced to carry additional workloads to accommodate the religious practices of co-workers, and that the secular nature of the workplace would be eroded.&lt;ref name="Huffington on 2010 reintroduction" /&gt;  They and the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] and several other business organizations opposed it as placing undue legal burdens on employers.&lt;ref name="Huffington on 2010 reintroduction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Christianity Today - 2008" /&gt;    When the scope of the provision which would create 42 U.S.C. 2000e(j)(2) was narrowed, supporters of the bill claimed that the ACLU dropped its opposition, although the ACLU itself declined comment.  Michael J. Eastman, executive director of labor law policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said of the revised bill, "We are not in the habit of supporting bills that make it easier to sue our members."&lt;ref name="Huffington on 2010 reintroduction" /&gt;

'''''Young Abraham''''' is a [[CGI animation|CGI animated film]] portraying the early years of [[biblical]] [[Abraham]].

== Plot ==
The film opens with a portentous observation by King [[Nimrod|Nimrod's]] chief stargazer. He witnesses one star consuming four surrounding stars, after which an ethereal light emanating from the remaining star bathes one house in the city of [[Ur Kaśdim]], the seat of Nimrod's kingdom. Inside this home, a baby has been born to Nimrod's general [[Terah|Terakh]] and his wife, Amaslei. Spurred by his stargazer's warnings of impending rebellion by this infant, Nimrod orders young Abraham put to death.

Terakh deceives Nimrod and furnishes the baby of his servant girl to take Abraham's place. Amaslei flees, and for the next several years she rears Avraham in hiding. Early on, Avraham displays high intelligence and he quickly arrives at the conclusion of a 
[[Monotheism|singular god]]. Emboldened by his discovery of [[Yahweh|God]] in a pervasively [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] land, he returns to Ur Kaśdim where he assumes a janitorial position at his father's idol shop. One day, Utz visits the shop to buy an idol. Abraham innocently asks Utz to explain how an inanimate idol of stone can provide for and he urges Utz to disavow idolatry. Then, after destroying all the idols in the shop, Avraham places the mallet into the hand of a stone likeliness of Nimrod, the largest idol in the shop and attempts to mollify his father Terakh, insisting that the idol of Nimrod was the perpetrator of the [[iconoclasm]]. Enraged by the carnage of his idols, Terakh permits Nimrod's men to frogmarch his son to Nimrod to be condemned for his blasphemous and treasonable actions.

Abraham breaks loose of the guard's grip en route the palace, and finds himself on the run once again. After a fortuitous encounter with an angel, who saves him from certain death in the desert, Abraham is led by the angel to the [[yeshiva]] of [[Noah]]. Noah takes Abraham under his wing and eventually instructs a now-matured and grown up Abraham to return to Ur Kaśdim and smash the pyramid of Mesopotamian idolatry.

The final scene of the film is a showdown in which Abraham defiantly refuses to acknowledge Nimrod's bald self-declaration as "God Supreme" of the world. An infuriated Nimrod hurls Abraham into a bonfire, but he miraculously survives before the eyes of a repentant Nimrod, who now recognizes the God of Abraham and instructs his people to convert to Abraham's monotheistic beliefs.

== Production ==
Drawing on the [[Bible]], [[Midrash]] and numerous commentaries, Rabbis Yisroel Bernath and Zvi Hershcovich researched and wrote the first draft of the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lubavitch News Service/Lubavitch.com|url=http://lubavitch.com/news/article/2031805/Animated-Film-About-Young-Abraham-Wins-Audiences.html|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
