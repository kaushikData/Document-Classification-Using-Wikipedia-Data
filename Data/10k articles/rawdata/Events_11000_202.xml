'''Aarhus Symposium''' is an annual leadership conference taking place at the [[Aarhus University|University of Aarhus]], [[Denmark]], on the first Friday in November. The aim of the event is to connect leaders of today with leaders of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; To do so, a wide range of key decision-makers are invited to share their experiences and engage in discussions with students from various universities. Hereby, the symposium allows students to relate their academic insights to the broader business society.&lt;ref&gt;http://studerende.au.dk/nyheder-og-arrangementer/nyhedsarkiv/nyhed/artikel/danske-topledere-ruster-au-studerende-til-barsk-virkelighed/&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium was founded in 2011 and has since expanded its concept to also involve [[Aarhus Symposium#Aarhus Symposium Focus|Aarhus Symposium Focus]]&lt;ref name="Faglig"&gt;http://www.netvaerksportalen.dk/artikler/studerende-og-topledere-moedes-i-faglig-debat-aarhus-symposium&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aarhus Symposium#Aarhus Symposium Challenge|Aarhus Symposium Challenge]].&lt;ref name="Challenge"&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/97854/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium is a non-profit organisation, and all symposia are organised by voluntary students together with a pro-bono board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/erhverv/ECE7183981/Leder-event-udsolgt-p%C3%A5-90-sekunder/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/become-a-partner/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Four students at [[Aarhus University]] established Aarhus Symposium in 2011: David Scherer, Jens Riis Andersen, Kasper Vinther Olesen, and Andreas Emmertsen. They gathered support from other students to organise the very first Aarhus Symposium with the objective of building a bridge between students, i.e. the future leaders, and leaders in today’s businesses and society.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/12/3184822/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://stiften.dk/aarhus/Erhvervslivets-tunge-drenge-yder-studiehjaelp/artikel/92572&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual Aarhus Symposium welcomed renowned speakers from the business society such as Carsten Bjerg (then CEO of [[Grundfos]]), Lars Rohde (then CEO of [[Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension|ATP]]), and Maria Rønn (CEO of [[DR (broadcaster)|Danmarks Radio]]).&lt;ref name="Growth"&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/past-symposia/growth-in-distressed-economies/&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the years, the programme has extended to include prominent speakers such as [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Denmark]],&lt;ref&gt;http://kongehuset.dk/menu/nyheder/abning-af-aarhus-symposium-2014&lt;/ref&gt; Lars Rebien Sørensen (president and CEO of [[Novo Nordisk]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ECE8162162/Studerende-har-hyret-verdens-bedste-chef/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]].&lt;ref&gt;https://jyskebank.tv/nutidens-og-fremtidens-ledere-modes-til-aarhus&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium has grown through the years as a result of wide support from students, speakers, partners, and others.&lt;ref name="Faglig"/&gt; In 2012, the Organising Committee introduced Battle of the Economists; an event to take place on Monday in the week of Aarhus Symposium. It provided a national focus to the overall theme of Aarhus Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/63904/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt; The event was renamed Aarhus Symposium Focus in 2016 to broaden the possibilities for topics that exceed economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/aarhussymposium/docs/booklet2016_final_rgb&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Aarhus Symposium Challenge was established to strengthen the connection between students and the leaders of today.&lt;ref name="Challenge"/&gt; Aarhus Symposium Challenge is an essay competition in which selected speakers put forth a challenge for students to solve. Through their essay, students obtain a seat at both Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus, and they potentially qualify for [[Aarhus Symposium#Leaders' Forum|Leaders’ Forum]]. Since its initiation in 2013, an increasing number of students have participated in Aarhus Symposium Challenge, making it the primary sign-up for Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/aarhus-symposium-challenge/&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the years, Leaders’ Forum has attracted much attention from the media inasmuch as it is unique in a Danish context and provides both the attending students and the top leaders the opportunity to learn from each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/97871/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business.dk/digital/jimmy-maymann-det-nytter-ikke-at-ville-holde-fremskridtet-tilbage&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6300">The '''Abyei status referendum''' is a delayed [[referendum]] that was originally due to be held in 2011 in which the residents of [[Abyei]] can decide either to remain part of the [[Sudan]]ese [[South Kordofan]] region or to become part of the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] region of [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/sudan-referendum:-abyei---one-tiny-issue-yet-unresolved-2011011967952.html |title=Actualités Afrique - Economie, sport, santé, politique |publisher=Afriquejet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}} {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The referendum was originally planned to be held simultaneously to the [[Southern Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|2011 Southern Sudanese independence referendum]] on January 9–15, 2011, but was postponed indefinitely due to disagreements over the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/Africa-Monitor/2011/0127/Five-challenges-South-Sudan-will-face-after-referendum |title=Five challenges South Sudan will face after referendum |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gmi0BvkkpT-StiTp2dmFbgU3V5-w?docId=CNG.5dbb2ae267c48491c896d1a990fa1596.891 |title=Abyei clashes not impacting Sudan referendum: US |publisher=Google.com |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the uncertainty, violence erupted in which more than 30 people were killed. As a response the UN deployed extra troops to its [[UNMIS]] contingent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.africanews.com/site/Extra_joint_troops_to_be_deployed_to_Abyei/list_messages/37164 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128203214/http://www.africanews.com/site/Extra_joint_troops_to_be_deployed_to_Abyei/list_messages/37164# |archive-date=2011-01-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The impasse on the referendum is due to lack of agreement on who constitutes a "resident of Abyei". The question is whether to include the [[Messiria tribe]], who have historically stayed in the region every year for six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rebecca Hamilton |url=http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/how-residency-dispute-one-key-town-could-lead-sudan-back-war |title=Sudan: Residency Dispute Threatens Abyei Referendum |publisher=Pulitzer Center |date=2011-01-09 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2012, the [[African Union]] proposal was to hold a referendum in October 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201209240054.html |title=South Sudan Accepts African Union Proposal Over Abyei With Mixed Reactions |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=2012-09-24 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the endorsement from the [[African Union Peace and Security Council]] following a mediation team led by former South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]] that included the exclusion of the Messiria, until Sudan rejected the offer saying it was sovereign over the region and that such a demarche would threaten the entire [[conflict resolution]] process. It also offered a six-week delay, until 9 December, to agree to the terms of a referendum between Sudan and South Sudan. Sudanese Foreign Minister [[Ali Karti]] said that he had confidence that the AU would accord both states more time to resolve difference over organising the referendum. He told the Sudanese parliament, in particular MPs from [[South Kordofan]], that the AU proposal "will not ever see the light of day" and it will not be referred to the United Nations Security Council as the United States of America wants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article44746 |title=Sudanese foreign minister predicts additional time over Abyei |publisher=Sudan Tribune |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal vote==
Between 27 and 29 October 2013 an informal, non-binding vote was held, although unrecognised by either Sudan or South Sudan. Only the [[Dinka people|Ngok Dinka]] tribe participated, with the Arab Misseriya tribe boycotting, claiming it would not recognise the result. The vote followed UN and AU warnings that such a move could inflame tensions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/10/sudan-abyei-referendum-enters-second-day-201310289549134671.html&lt;/ref&gt; As counting took place, the Misseriya vowed to carry out its own such referendum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/10/counting-begins-after-abyei-referendum-201310301120751245.html&lt;/ref&gt; The spokesman for the Abyei Referendum High Committee, Luka Biong, announced that of those who voted, 99.9% supported joining South Sudan; this was then followed by celebrations.

The head of the African Union, [[Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma]], said the vote was illegal and its organisers risked sparking a return to war. "They pose a threat to peace in the Abyei area, and have the potential to trigger an unprecedented escalation on the ground... with far-reaching consequences for the region as a whole." An independent observer, Tim Flatman, said that 63,433 of 64,775 registered voters took part in the referendum and that only 12 voted to be part of Sudan, while there were 362 spoiled ballots. Flatman also suggested initial observations suggested a "very transparent process."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/10/abyei-dinka-vote-join-south-sudan-2013103193942652913.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5536">'''Adoption fraud''' also known as illegal [[adoption]] can be defined as when a person or institute attempts to either illegally adopt a child or illegally give up a child for adoption.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EiPWZm49bLYC&amp;pg=PA218 |title=Yes, You Can Adopt!: A Comprehensive Guide to Adoption|publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common ways in which this can be done include dishonesty and [[bribe]]s.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adoptimist.com/adoption-blog/internet-adoption-scams-russian-adoption-ban|title=Internet Adoption Scams and the Russian Adoption Ban|last=Bernardo|first=Sanford M.|date=31 December 2012|publisher=Adoptimist|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence and statistics==
It can be quite difficult to obtain accurate statistics concerning adoption fraud. However, below is a sample "603 adoptions were recorded by [[Greece]]'s courts in 2005, an increase of 20 percent over the previous year, according to government statistics. But fewer than 60 of these adoptions were carried out through [[state channel]]s",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childtrafficking.org/cgi-bin/ct/main.sql?file=view_document.sql&amp;TITLE=-1&amp;AUTHOR=-1&amp;THESAURO=-1&amp;ORGANIZATION=-1&amp;TOPIC=-1&amp;GEOG=-1&amp;YEAR=-1&amp;LISTA=No&amp;COUNTRY=-1&amp;FULL_DETAIL=Yes&amp;ID=2816 |title=Child Trafficking |publisher=Child Trafficking |date=2006-12-18 |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that in some regions of the world up to 90% of adoptions share the potential of being illegal.

==Prevention and variants==
[[Genetics]] and other forms of identification may help in convicting and catching those who do adoption fraud. This field also has the potential to block potential criminals from committing this crime beforehand.&lt;ref name="Howell"&gt;{{cite web|author=Whitney L.J. Howell |url=http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2010/11/dna.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111152604/http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2010/11/dna.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-11-11 |title=Adoption Fraud, Forensics and Genetics &amp;#124; Duke Today |publisher=Dukenews.duke.edu |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2011-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brandeis1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/investigate/gender/adoption/docs/DOS_fact_sheet_on_Focus_on_Children_Adoption_Fraud_Case_3-1-07.pdf |title=Fact Sheet on Focus On Children Adoption Fraud Case |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402221603/http://www.brandeis.edu/investigate/gender/adoption/docs/DOS_fact_sheet_on_Focus_on_Children_Adoption_Fraud_Case_3-1-07.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
In addition to being an offense that carries a [[felony]] in many nations (including the [[United States]]) adoption fraud is also illegal on an international scale. Perpetrators of this felony may face [[imprisonment]] and [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s  if they are convicted.&lt;ref name="Howell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brandeis1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csuspress.lib.csus.edu/sinology/content/ren_xin.html |title=Legal Protection Of Women S Rights In China |publisher=Csuspress.lib.csus.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315214448/http://csuspress.lib.csus.edu/sinology/content/ren_xin.html |archivedate=2012-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/ut/press/releases/focus_on_children_indictment.pdf |title=U |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016100408/http://www.justice.gov/usao/ut/press/releases/focus_on_children_indictment.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Scott and Karen Banks - Focus on Children, [[Utah]]-[[Samoa]]
*Others involved: [[Dan Wakefield]]
* The [[Tennessee Children's Home Society]], an unlicensed adoption agency used by its longtime director [[Georgia Tann]] as a front for black market adoptions. An investigation in 1950 revealed the illegal activities of the Society; Tann died that year before she could be prosecuted. Many celebrities, among them [[Joan Crawford]] and the husband-wife pair of [[Dick Powell]] and [[June Allyson]], used the Society for their adoptions, but were unaware of the means Tann used to obtain children. Professional wrestling legend [[Ric Flair]] was one of the last children adopted through the Society.

== Television ==
The ''[[Dr. Phil Show]]'' had an episode revolving around an adoption scam between a couple and single mother. The couple placed an ad on [[Craigslist]] to which the scammer immediately replied. The couple was sent fake ultrasounds and fake medical reports, and received money. With the use of technology, the scammer was able to keep the lie about giving the child to them for more than nine months. The episode informed people about signs to look out for when adopting a child, especially when it is not through an adoption agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|series=[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]|url = http://www.drphil.com/shows/show/2218|date = August 20, 2014|title = "Where Are Our Newborn Twins?"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4329">'''Aḍ-Ḍaḥāk ibn Qays al-Shaybānī''' ({{lang-ar|الضحاك بن قيس الشيباني}}) was the leader of a widespread but unsuccessful [[Kharijite]] rebellion in [[Iraq]] against the [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Marwan II]] from 745 until his death in battle in 746.

== Crisis of the caliphate and the Kharijite revolt ==
The deposition of [[al-Walid II]] in spring 744 began a [[Third Fitna|turbulent period]] in the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]; his successor [[Yazid III]] died within a few months, and the ambitious governor of [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] [[Marwan II|Marwan ibn Muhammad]], rebelled against Yazid's designated successor, [[Ibrahim ibn al-Walid]]. Marwan succeeded in gaining control of [[Damascus]] and [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], but elsewhere his authority ranged from theoretical to non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Hawting (2000), pp. 93-97&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iraq, this turmoil spilled over in the form of a struggle between Yazid III's governor [[Abdallah ibn Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]] and Marwan's appointee, [[al-Nadr ibn Sa'id al-Harashi]]. This conflict allowed the [[Kharijites]], a Muslim sect which had originated in [[Mesopotamia]], to rise up. This revolt was initially led by Sa'id ibn Bahdal, but he died soon of the plague, and was succeeded by Dahhak.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;Veccia Vaglieri (1965), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRH100"&gt;Hawting (2000), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Dahhak quickly assembled a sizeable army, and managed to defeat the two rival governors, who had joined forces, in April/May 745. In the aftermath of their defeat, al-Harashi returned to Marwan and Abdallah ibn Umar retreated to the fortress of [[Wasit, Iraq|Wasit]], where he was soon besieged. In August however Ibn Umar gave himself up, and, in an unprecedented act for a member of the Umayyad dynasty and of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]'s own [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe, did homage to Dahhak, who was neither and who had by now been declared [[caliph]] by his followers.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRH100"/&gt; [[Kufa]] was now occupied by Dahhak's forces and became his seat, while Ibn Umar was named governor of Wasit, eastern Iraq and western [[Persia]]. Dahhak's generosity in rewarding his followers, as well as the attractiveness of Kharijite doctrine quickly swelled his ranks further, until his army is said to have reached 120,000 men. Among others, the famed general [[Sulayman ibn Hisham|Sulayman]], a son of Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] and opponent of Marwan, sought refuge with him.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRH100"/&gt;

== End of the rebellion ==
While Marwan was preoccupied with besieging Sulayman's brother Sa'id and his supporters in [[Homs]], Dahhak marched into [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|northern Mesopotamia]]. After he took [[Mosul]], Marwan ordered his own son Abdallah, who resided at [[Harran]], to confront the Kharijites' advance. Abdallah however was defeated and retreated to [[Nisibis]], where he was besieged. After Homs fell however, Marwan with his army moved swiftly east. The two armies met at al-Ghazz in Kafartuta in August/September 746, and Dahhak's forces were decisively defeated, with Dahhak himself falling early in the battle. His successor, al-Khaybari, tried to renew the attack but was also killed.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawting (2000), pp. 100-101&lt;/ref&gt; The Kharijite rebellion persisted, under Abu Dulaf, for another year, but by the end of 747, Mesopotamia, Iraq and Persia had been secured by Marwan.&lt;ref&gt;Hawting (2000), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ali Pascha von Janina oder Die Franzosen in Albanien''''' (''Ali Pasha of Ioannina or The French in Albania'') is a one-act German [[singspiel]]. It is set around 1820 in [[Ioannina]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and is named after its central character [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina]].

Its music and [[libretto]] are both by the German composer [[Albert Lortzing]] – it can be considered as a precursor to his later full-length operas. He had decided to write for the stage in 1823, aged 22. [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] subjects were then popular and so he chose that theme for his first work. On 30 January 1824 he married [[Rosina Regina Ahles]] and soon afterwards he completed the music, but it took him until 1828 to find a theatre which would mount the work.

The couple took on an engagement at the [[Landestheater Detmold|Hoftheater Detmold]] in autumn 1826, as well as appearing in theatres in [[Münster]] and [[Osnabrück]].  Lortzing finally premiered the work in the [[Städtische Bühnen Münster]] in on 1 February 1828, where it was a moderate success and enabled him to continue writing plays.

==Characters==
*Ali Bey, Pasha of Joannina ([[bass (voice type)|bass]])
*Ibrahim, overseer of the pasha's harem (bass)
*Captain Bernier ([[tenor]])
*Lieutenant Robert, Bernier's friend (tenor)
*Arianna, a girl from Corfu ([[soprano]])
*Soldiers, sailors, guards, slavegirls, slaves, imprisoned maidens (chorus)

==Plot==
Stationed in Ioannina with his battalion, the French naval captain Bernier has fallen in love with Arianna, a beautiful girl from the nearby island of [[Corfu]]. However, he has not heard from her for days and is worried about what might have happened to her. Bernier's friend Robert tries in vain to comfort him.

Bernier's concerns prove justified – Arianna had been captured by a wild horde whilst out walking on the beach and taken to Ali Pasha's [[harem]]. Ali Pasha cannot bear her laments and complaints and orders her to forget Bernier since she now belongs to him alone. The other women in the harem are unwilling to raise Arianna's hopes and instead advise her that the only way to survive her suffering is to submit herself to fate and Ali Pasha's will.

In the meantime Bernier receives news of his beloved and gains entry to Ali Pasha's palace under a pretext. Ali Pasha is initially delighted to welcome a Frenchman and brings in Arianna to show her off to him, make Bernier envious and draw on Bernier's knowledge of women.

Bernier and Arianna find it hard to conceal their true feelings and pretend that they do not know each other, but only a few minutes after Ali Pasha leaves she admits to her love. Ali Pasha overhears this from a hiding place and rushes back in swearing vengeance. Bernier is chained up but Robert and the French battalion succeed in penetrating the harem. They free Bernier and Arianna and return with them to France.

{{nihongo|'''''Buddha'''''|ブッダ|Budda|lead=yes}} is a [[manga]] drawn by [[Osamu Tezuka]] and is Tezuka's unique interpretation of the life of [[Gautama Buddha]], the founder of [[Buddhism]]. The critically acclaimed series is often referred to as a visually explicit yet humorous and thought-provoking portrayal of the Buddha's life. The series began in September 1972 and ended in December 1983, as one of Tezuka's last [[Epic (genre)|epic]] manga works.

''Buddha'' received the 2004 and 2005 [[Eisner Award]]. As of early 2006, each volume had sold an average of 8,500 copies, with the first volume, ''Kapilavastu'', having sold 20,000 copies. Due to differences between the ways in which Japanese and English are read, the American volumes published by [[Vertical Inc.]] are presented as mirror images of Tezuka's original work so they can be read from left to right, rather than from right to left. Nearly three decades after the manga was completed, an [[anime]] film adaptation was released in 2011. A second film was released in 2014.

==Plot==
In [[History of Nepal|ancient India]], the lives of many people are plagued by drought, famine, constant warfare and injustices in the [[Caste system in Nepal|caste system]]. The intertwining lives of many unhappy souls are drawn together by the birth of the young prince Siddhartha, who embarks on a spiritual journey, and becomes [[Gautama Buddha]], "the Enlightened One", and attempts to bring about a spiritual rebirth of the people in this desperate age.

==Characters==
* '''[[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama (Sakyamuni Buddha)]]: ''' The main character of the Buddha series and prince of the [[Shakya]] tribe.  He is born midway into book 1, shortly after his birth his mother dies.  The first book mentions omens that seemed to symbolize Siddhartha's future.  In book 2, he is a child growing bored of the privileged life of a prince.  He leaves the palace towards the end of the book to become a monk.  In book 3, he is a struggling monk.  In book 4, after many trials in the Forest of Uruvela, Buddha achieves enlightenment.  He continues to teach his disciples and inspire others until his death in book 8.
* '''Chapra: ''' A fictional character from the lower [[Shudra]] caste who decides to make a better life for himself. After saving the life of a well-known Kosalan general, Chapra is adopted by him as his own son, under the belief that Chapra is a [[Kshatriya]] warrior orphan. After growing up, Chapra's true heritage is revealed when his mother shows up, resulting in conflict for Chapra.  Chapra eventually decides to escape with her after the truth of his caste is revealed and the two are killed by Kosalan soldiers.
* '''[[Yasodhara|Princess Yashodara]]: ''' A beautiful princess who loved Siddhartha and is also the latter's cousin.  He married her against his will, and together they had a son named [[Rāhula]].  Siddhartha left on the day Rahula was born.
* '''Bandaka: ''' An arrogant archer who appears in book 1 and 2.  He was in love with Yashodara and fought Buddha for her hand in marriage.  After Buddha left to pursue enlightenment, Bandaka convinced Buddha's father to name him heir to the Shakyan but still failed to win Yashodara over.  He then resigns himself to taking a plump noblewoman as his wife, fathering Devadatta, and is later killed while fighting the invading Kosalan army.
* '''[[Pasenadi|Prasennajit]]: ''' The ruler of [[Kosala]].  He married a slave from [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]], tricked to think she was a [[Kshatriya]], and takes over Kapilavastu when he finds out the truth.  When he objects to his son Virudhaka releasing Kapilavatsu, Virudhaka imprisons his father, claiming he is mentally unfit to rule.  In his cell, Prasentnajit gradually wanes physically and mentally until Buddha convinces his son to release him.  He dies shortly afterward, reduced to a mere beggar.
* '''[[Virudhaka (raja)|Virudhaka]]: ''' Prasentnajit's son.  After learning of his mother's true caste, he ostracizes her to the slave quarters and later orders her to be killed with the other slaves when plague breaks out among them.  For tricking his father, Virudhaka begins a gradual extermination of Buddha's tribe until Buddha shows him that all he's accomplished is to increase the suffering he already felt. He is sometimes called Prince Crystal due to the Lapis Lazuli set in his forehead.
* '''[[Bimbisara]]: ''' The king of [[Magadha]], whom Asaji prophesies will be killed by his son.  This torments Bimbisara all his life.  Drugged by Devadatta, Bimbisara is overthrown by his son Ajasattu and locked in the same tower he jailed his son in for attempting to kill Buddha where he gradually starves to death.  On his death bed, Bimbisara meets Buddha one more time and asks Buddha to save his son.  In his final hours, he regrets not showing his son more affection, instead consumed by paranoia that his son would kill him as prophesied.
* '''[[Ajatashatru|Prince Ajasattu]]: '''  Bimbisara's son, who is imprisoned in book 6 because he shot and almost killed Buddha with an arrow. He falls in love with a blue-eyed blonde slave named Yudelka, and vows revenge on his father when she is murdered. Ajasattu, with the help of Devadatta, overthrows his father.  The guilt causes him to have a malignant tumor, which Buddha cures.  In doing so, Buddha sees him smile for the first time, and pronounces "It's in the heart of man... that God exists."
* '''Tatta: ''' A fictional thief of the 'Pariah', making his status even lower than that of the slave caste. As a child, Tatta is very close to nature and has the unique ability to possess animals, which the Brahmin Naradatta takes great advantage of. In volume 1, after befriending the slave Chapra, his mother and sister are murdered by the rampaging armies of Kosala. After Kosala's soldiers execute Chapra and 'Moms', Tatta vows revenge upon the kingdom of Kosala. As he grows up, Tatta becomes a bandit and reveals his plan of vengeance is to show the outside world to the sheltered child, Siddhartha, in hopes of persuading him to vanquish Kosala when he becomes king. In book 3, he agrees to stop being a bandit.  In book 5, he becomes a lay disciple to Buddha, unwilling to become a monk because it would mean cutting his hair.  Despite Buddha's attempts to convince him otherwise, Tatta is unable to forgive the Kosalans for killing those close to him and joins a renegade Shakyan army who sought revenge for the atrocities inflicted on them by Crystal Prince.  He dies in the last book fighting the Kosalan army.
* '''Migaila: ''' A sexy bandit whom Buddha falls in love with in book 2.  Her eyes are burnt out on order from Buddha's father for scheming to marry him which leaves her blind for the rest of the series however she is able to "see" the world mysteriously.  After a stillbirth, she becomes fatally ill with a total body rash, that leaves her terrifying to look at.  Siddartha saves her life with Tatta by sucking the poison out with their mouths.  She is Tatta's wife, and they have one son in book 4, a stillborn, and triplets, introduced in book 7.
* '''Dhepa: ''' A samanna (a non-Brahmin monk), whose philosophy is that humans were meant to suffer.  He burns out one of his eyes to join Tatta and Migaila.  Buddha befriends Dhepa in book 3, but the two part ways when Buddha decides against Dhepa's lifestyle.  Despite ridiculing Buddha's teachings and even attempting to kill him at one point, Buddha saves Dhepa's life in book 5 whereupon Dhepa becomes his disciple.
* '''[[Hosuke Sharaku|Asaji]]: ''' In volume 3, Siddhartha and Dhepa are sheltered by a huntsman and his family. In return, the huntsman asks the monks if his infant son, Asaji, can join them on their travels. Judging Asaji by his dimwitted look and runny nose, Dhepa and Siddhartha refuse, attempting to flee from Asaji by any means necessary. When Asaji catches a fever after pursuing the monks through the monsoon season, Siddhartha is determined to save him. Siddhartha cures Asaji by sucking the poisonous pus from his body. Meanwhile, the unconscious Asaji encounters a god in a vision that tells him in ten years time he will be devoured by beasts in payment for his father's meaningless hunting. As time passes, when Siddhartha is separated from the other monks, Asaji successfully and precisely predicts natural disasters. His predictions are a gift from a god. Eventually, he is brought forth before King Bimbisara and prophesies his fate and that of many other palace nobles. When Siddhartha undertakes the trials of the forest, he is astounded that Asaji is completely fearless of his gruesome destiny. When the moment of truth arrives, Asaji approaches a litter of starving wolf-cubs and sacrifices himself to the ferocious parents that tear him apart, much to Siddhartha's horror.
* '''[[Devadatta]]: '''  One of Buddha's first disciples.  The son of Bandaka, Devadatta had a difficult childhood.  As a child, he is forced to flee from Kapilavastu and meets Naradatta, learning to live with animals.  When he returns to civilization, he is exploited by others to gain power, and sees a powerless old woman die.  As a result, he resolves "I'll be a strong human, the strongest alive!"  He met Tatta when looking for a warrior, and through Tatta, Devadatta met the Buddha.  He leaves the sect when he is not chosen to be Buddha's successor and attempts to form his own sect by stealing Buddha's followers.  When that fails Devadatta plots to kill Buddha; first by dropping a boulder on him, then by having an elephant stampede him.  When his initial attempts fail,  Devadatta poisons his nails but accidentally injures himself with them when he trips.  In his final moments, he reveals that he hated the Buddha because he wanted to be just like him but couldn't.
* '''[[Visakha]]: '''  Visakha is the leader of a town suffering from a plague, which took her parents' lives.  She is betrothed to Sukanda, a knight tasked with guarding the city.  She meets Siddartha for the first time, when he and Dhepa rest in the town to save Asaji from a nearly fatal illness.  She falls in love with him and tries to keep him in her city.  Tatta, along with his bandits, then invade the town, rescuing Siddartha, and taking Viskha with them.  The bandits also burn the town.  Sukanda, comes to rescue her, but realizing she does not love him, commits suicide.  Siddartha, Tatta, and Visakha part ways.  Years later, Siddartha comes upon the remains of the town and meets Visakha again.  She is the only resident of the town and is addicted to hallucinatory potions.  Siddartha rescues her; when she eventually sobers, she becomes a disciple.
* '''Sujata: '''  Sujata first meets Siddartha as a young girl.  She saves his life by feeding him, when he nearly starves from fasting during an ordeal.  Later she saves him yet again, having fallen in love with him.  She's eventually bitten by a cobra.  Siddartha saves her life by pulling a soul back into her body, with instruction from Brahman.  This is also the first time we see the recurring visual motif of interconnected souls
* '''[[Ananda]]: ''' Ananda is the half-brother of Devadetta as mentioned briefly in book 3. A former criminal who becomes one of Buddha's major disciples.  The devil Mara protected him after Ananda's father offered him in exchange for sparing his life.  Following his mother's murder, Ananda seeks revenge on all humanity until Buddha saved his life.  Ananda then becomes Buddha's personal attendant and companion although visions of hell and death continue to haunt him.
* '''Lata: ''' A pretty former slave with whom Ananda falls in love.  She has difficulty speaking.  Lata cuts off her hair to achieve enlightenment.  She dies after receiving a snake bite meant for Buddha in book 7.
* '''[[Angulimala]]: ''' A ruthless killer who works with Ananda and tries to kill Buddha.  He is known to wear the fingers of his victims as a necklace around his neck.  He ends up changing his ways thanks to Buddha's guidance.
* '''Naradatta: ''' A monk who is turned into an animal for forty years as punishment for killing several animals in order to save one human.  He becomes a mentor for Devadatta.  Naradatta dies in the last book, moments after he is forgiven for his murder and returned to his human state.
* '''Yatala: ''' A twenty-foot giant. The son of a slave who studied herbs and plants, Yatala's father gave him a potion that would make him grow to be powerful and invincible. His parents were killed shortly after he received the potion which caused him to grow twenty feet high by adulthood. Yatala then killed the elephant that killed his parents and wandered off, killing livestock and terrorizing villages. Many tried to kill him unsuccessfully, including a person with a bazooka. Finally, Virudhaka, or Prince Crystal, tamed him by offering him a position within the Kosalan palace guard. However, Yatala was angered by how Virudhaka abused his mother simply because of her caste and escaped whereupon he met Buddha who shows him how Virudhaka is suffering as well. He later went to work for the Kinga of Magadha before shaving his head and becoming Buddha's disciple.
* '''Master [[Asita]]:'''  Naradatta's master.  He appears in the first book briefly and sends Naradatta to find a man with the power to save the world.  He later goes to the baby prince [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta]] and gives him blessings from [[Brahma]] and [[Indra]].  He later curses Naradatta for killing several animals to save the life of one human.  He was also shown to have [[siddhis]]
* '''[[Brahman]]:''' Supreme universal Spirit.  Appearing frequently to Buddha as a wizened old man, Brahman sets Siddhartha on the path to seeking a solution to suffering.  After Buddha obtained enlightenment, Brahman bestowed him with the title of Buddha.  After the Buddha died in book 8, Brahman personally escorted the Buddha to the afterlife where he promised to reveal [[Nirvana (concept)|what awaited those who pass into death]].

==Themes==
*'''[[Pratītyasamutpāda]]:'''  The interconnectedness of life is highlighted first, in Master Asita's story of his master, Gosala, being saved by animals.  In the story, a rabbit immolates itself to save his life.  Later on, Assaji similarly sacrifices himself to be consumed by a pack of starving baby wolves.
*'''[[Impermanence]]:'''  Throughout the story, characters go through many ups and down - kings are imprisoned by their own sons, murderers become holy men, and numerous characters die, emphasizing the impermanence of life.

It is well known as the community of the Mary-Ellen spook farm, also known as the fire [[ghost|spook]]. It was alleged that the community experienced mysterious fires and [[poltergeist]] effects between 1899 and 1922. The case drew the attention of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], the author of [[Sherlock Holmes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.townofantigonish.ca/folklore.html "The Fire-Spook of Caledonia Mills"]. The Town of Antigonish.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary-Ellen's biological parents were John and Annie (Duggan) MacDonald and she was later adopted by Alexander and Janet MacDonald of Caledonia Mills.

[[Walter Franklin Prince]], research officer for the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] in 1922 investigated and concluded that the mysterious fires and alleged poltergeist phenomena were caused by Mary-Ellen in a [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociated state]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Robert Colombo|Colombo, John Robert]]. (2000). ''Ghost Stories of Canada''. Dundurn. p. 43. {{ISBN|0-88882-222-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince had discovered inflammable liquid and noted that "the fires were undoubtedly set by human hands, judging by the unmistakable signs left in the house. The burns are never found on the wall paper higher than the reach of a person five feet tall, which is the height of [the] girl in the family."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/GhostWasAGirlDr.PrinceReports ''Ghost Was a Girl, Dr. Prince Reports''].

[[File:Charlie Charlie Challenge.jpg|thumb|Basic set up for the two pencil game, with the top pencil balanced straight, such that minor air movements can cause it to rotate]]
The '''Charlie Charlie challenge''' is a modern incarnation of the Spanish [[paper-and-pencil game]] called ''Juego de la Lapicera'' (Pencil Game). Like a [[Magic 8-Ball]], the game is played by teenagers using held or balanced pencils to produce answers to questions they ask. Teenage girls have played ''Juego de la Lapicera'' for generations in Spain and [[Hispanic America]], asking which boys in their class like them.&lt;ref name="mail" /&gt;

Originally described on the Internet in 2008,&lt;ref name=emery1/&gt; the game was popularized in the [[English-speaking world]] in 2015, partly through the [[hashtag]] #CharlieCharlieChallenge.&lt;ref name=griffin1/&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Esther|title=Here’s Why People Are Freaking Out Over the Charlie Charlie Challenge|url=http://time.com/3897606/charlie-charlie-challenge/|work=Time|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 April 2015, an alarmist [[tabloid television]] newscast about the game being played in [[Hato Mayor Province]] of the [[Dominican Republic]] was uploaded to YouTube, and the unintentional humor in the report led to the game trending on Twitter, crossing the [[language barrier]] to be played around the world.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dewey|first1=Caitlin|title=The complete, true story of Charlie Charlie, the 'demonic' teen game overtaking the Internet|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/05/26/the-complete-true-story-of-charlie-charlie-the-demonic-teen-game-overtaking-the-internet/|accessdate=28 May 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21nnsHkvkRM|title=Juego supuestamente satánico denominado Charlie – Charlie es practicado en Hato Mayor|work=Telenoticias 11/Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game==

===Four pencils===
In an early version of the game, two players each hold two pencils in the shape of a square, pressing the ends of their pencils against the other player's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3096964/Children-sharing-social-media-videos-try-summon-Mexican-demon-new-Charlie-Charlie-Challenge.html|quote=There is also a two-person version of the game that uses six pencils.|title=Creepy 'Charlie Charlie Challenge' spreads across Twitter as children urge each other to 'summon Mexican demon'|work=Daily Mail|date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like a [[Ouija]] board, it uses the [[ideomotor phenomenon]], with players moving the pencils without conscious control.&lt;ref name="vox"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/6/5/8735481/charlie-charlie-challenge-explanation|title="Charlie, Charlie, are you there?" Why teens are summoning demons, explained.|date=5 June 2015|author=Phil Edawards|work=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="livescience"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/51069-charlie-charlie-challenge-explained.html|title=Charlie Charlie Challenge: Can You Really Summon a Demon?|work=Livescience|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two pencils===
The two pencil game involves crossing two pens or pencils to create a grid (with sectors labelled "yes" and "no") and then asking questions to a "supernatural entity" named "Charlie." The upper pencil is then expected to rotate to indicate the answer to such questions. The first question everyone asks by speaking into the pencils is "can we play?" or "are you here?" or "are you there?" &lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlie Charlie Challenge – what is the spooky craze, and what is the explanation for it?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/11628862/Charlie-Charlie-Challenge-what-is-it-what-is-the-explanation.html|accessdate=28 May 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top pencil is precariously balanced on a central pivot point, meaning that it can easily rotate on the pivot due to slight wind gusts, or the breathing of players expecting the pencil to move.&lt;ref name=scishow&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfuhFlSGunM|title=The Truth About the Charlie Charlie Challenge|work=[[SciShow]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mail/&gt;&lt;ref name=griffin1/&gt;

==History==
In Spain, teenage girls have played ''Juego de la Lapicera'' for generations in school playgrounds and sleepovers to find which boys in their class found them attractive.&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3116725/Children-hospitalised-mass-hysteria-mysterious-bruises-Mexican-demon-video-Dominican-Republic-spawned-satanic-Charlie-Charlie-game-sending-teenagers-panic-world.html|title=How a video in the Dominican Republic spawned the 'satanic' Charlie Charlie game sending teenagers into a panic across the world|date=10 June 2015|work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Caitlyn Dewey of ''The Washington Post,'' this game is valuable as an example of cross-cultural viral trends: &lt;blockquote&gt;Charlie makes a killer case study in virality and how things move in and out of languages and cultures online. You'll notice, for instance, a lot of players and reporters talking about the game as if it were new, when it's actually—and more interestingly, I think—an old game that has just recently crossed the language divide.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Maria Elena Navez of [[BBC Mundo]] said "There's no demon called 'Charlie' in Mexico," and suggested that Mexican demons with English names (rather than, say, "Carlitos") are "usually American inventions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32887325|title=Where did Charlie Charlie Challenge come from?|publisher=BBC|date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urban legend]] expert David Emery says that some versions of the game have copied the ghost story [[La Llorona]], popular in [[Hispanic America]], but the pencil game is not a Mexican tradition.&lt;ref name=emery1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/fl/Charlie-Charlie-Challenge_2.htm|title=What's the Charlie Charlie Challenge, and Why Does It Freak People Out?|work=About.com Entertainment/Urban Legends|author=David Emery|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Laycock, a professor of religious studies at Texas State University argued that while Charlie is "most often described as a “Mexican ghost,” it appears that Christian critics reframed the game as Satanic almost immediately" due to their desire to "claim a monopoly on wholesome encounters with the supernatural."&lt;ref name=rdlaycock&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religiondispatches.org/the-charlie-charlie-challenge-and-teenage-yearning-for-supernatural-encounters/|title=The ‘Charlie Charlie Challenge’ and Teenage Yearning for Supernatural Encounters|work=Religion Dispatches|date=15 June 2015|author=Joseph Laycock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, ''The Racket Report'', a parody website that describes itself as "not intended to communicate any true or factual information,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theracketreport.com/contact-us/about-us/|title=About Us|work=The Racket Report(satire)}}&lt;/ref&gt; posted a hoax article claiming that 500 "mysterious" deaths had resulted from playing the Charlie Charlie Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/hoax-busted-reports-mysterious-deaths-after-playing-charlie-charlie-challenge-are-false-635030|title=Hoax Busted: Reports of Mysterious Deaths After Playing Charlie Charlie Challenge are False|work=International Business Times India|date=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fiji Sun]] reported claims made by the satire website as news in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fijisun.com.fj/2015/06/06/year-1-and-2-students-play-charlie-charlie/|title=Year 1 And 2 Students Play ‘Charlie Charlie’|work=Fiji Sun|date=6 June 2015|archivedate=15 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615204145/http://fijisun.com.fj/2015/06/06/year-1-and-2-students-play-charlie-charlie/|quote=The Racket Report reported online that Charlie Charlie is a dangerous new game going viral and is said to conjure up a group of Mexican demons. “It is considered a mash up of the Ouija board and bloody Mary, but this game is physically injuring its participants.

In May 2015, four teenage girls were sent to a hospital in [[Tunja]] and quickly released with a diagnosis of [[mass hysteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://colombiareports.com/charlie-charlie-challenge-sends-4-hysteric-teens-to-hospital-in-central-colombia/|title=Charlie Charlie Challenge sends 4 hysteric Colombian teens to hospital|author=Matthew Dancis|date=28 May 2015|publisher=Colombia Reports|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
Psychological [[suggestion]] can lead people to expect a particular response, which can result in thoughts and behaviors that will help bring the anticipated outcome to fruition – for instance by breathing more heavily.&lt;ref name=livescience/&gt; [[Chris French]], head of the [[anomalistic psychology]] research unit at the [[University of London]] says that human [[agent detection]] leads people to see patterns in random events and perceive an intelligence behind them. He argues that divination games involve [[magical thinking]], saying "Often the 'answers' received [in divination games] might be vague and ambiguous, but our inherent ability to find meaning—even when it isn't there—ensures that we will perceive significance in those responses and be convinced that an intelligence of some kind lay behind them."&lt;ref name=livescience/&gt; Kate Knibbs, writing in [[Gizmodo]] described the game as "a [[Vine (service)|Vine]]-ready pastiche of kitsch occultism" that "has the familiar pull of [[pareidolia]]" where people interpret patterns as having a meaning.&lt;ref name=gizmodo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/a-mexican-demon-named-charlie-is-the-internets-newest-u-1706999289|title=A Mexican Demon Named Charlie Is The Internet's Newest Urban Legend|work=Gizmodo|author=Kate Knibbs|date=28 May 2015|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart Vyse, a psychology professor at [[Connecticut College]] argues that teenagers often go to see [[Paranormal fiction|paranormal movies]] in groups, and "There's a real social bonding aspect to this whole phenomenon,"&lt;ref name=vox/&gt; and "It's almost a developmental passage for some kids, to deal with things that are scary." Donald Saucier, a psychology professor at [[Kansas State University]] argues that teenagers go through "a period where social influence is very strong" and they are more prone to superstition. Stephen Schlozman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at [[Harvard Medical School]] said "I think kids are interested in the dares that aren't actually all that dangerous, but have that feeling of danger to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/139957/charlie-charlie-science-behind-why-teens-brains-love-creepy-supernatural-games/|title=Why teen brains are wired to love 'Charlie Charlie' and the supernatural|publisher=fusion.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sharon A. Hill|Sharon Hill]] argues that teenagers playing the game "overreact because of the peer situation."&lt;ref name=sharonhill/&gt;

Pastor Carl Gallups told [[WPTF]] news radio "I have done some experiments with this, and I think people are being punked. On my desk in front of me, I have the two pencils set up and the one on the top that is balanced is easily moved by just a puff of air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/lifestyle/2015/06/10/charlie-charlie-game-summoning-mexican-demon-goes-viral-causing-damage-real-and/|title='Charlie Charlie' game summoning Mexican demon goes viral, causing damage real and fake|date=10 June 2015|work=Fox News Latino}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued, "I held my phone up to pretend like I was filming it and just started breathing a little heavy, but it's indiscernible to anybody around, and the pencil just moves so easily." Fred Clark and [[Rebecca Watson]] liken the phenomenon of pencils moving on a desk to [[James Hydrick]]'s debunked claim that he could move a pencil on a desk by [[psychokinesis]].&lt;ref name=slacktivist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2015/05/29/the-charliecharliechallenge-doesnt-lead-to-demonic-possession-but-it-can-nurture-credulity-and-willful-ignorance-which-is-worse/|title=The ‘CharlieCharlieChallenge’ doesn’t lead to demonic possession — but it can nurture credulity and willful ignorance, which is worse|author=Fred Clark|date=29 May 2015|work=Patheos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepchick.org/2015/05/charlie-charlie-the-science-of-summoning-demons-with-pencils-for-fun-and-profit/|title=Charlie Charlie: The Science of Summoning Demons with Pencils for Fun and Profit|work=Skepchick|author=[[Rebecca Watson]]|date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Griffin wrote in ''[[The Independent]]'' that the game is "perhaps scarier than a Ouija board because it doesn't have the same explanations. With those boards, players have to keep hold of a glass while it moves around the table—so it's not difficult to imagine that people might be pushing it around without knowing it."&lt;ref name=griffin1&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlie Charlie Challenge explained: it's just gravity—not a Mexican demon being summoned|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/weird-news/charlie-charlie-challenge-explained-its-not-a-mexican-demon-being-summoned--its-gravity-10276557.html|work=The Independent|date=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Emery argues [[Occam's razor|parsimoniously]] that when simple scientific explanations "can sufficiently explain why a phenomenon occurs, there's no reason to assume supernatural forces are at work."

'''Cheltenham Science Festival''' is one of the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s leading [[science festival]]s, and is part of [[Cheltenham Festivals]]: also responsible for the [[Cheltenham Jazz Festival|Jazz]], [[Cheltenham Music Festival|Music]] and [[Cheltenham Literature Festival|Literature]] Festivals that run every year. 

The 2018 Cheltenham Science Festival (6 - 11 June) was held in Imperial Square, Cheltenham.
==Introduction and History==
The youngest of the [[Cheltenham Festivals]], the ''Cheltenham Science Festival'' was first held in 2002, and has quickly grown to become one of the most significant of its kind in the UK.

==Guests and Directors==

The guest directors for Cheltenham Science Festival 2017 are television presenter and actor [[Dallas Campbell]] and former NASA Chief Scientist [[Ellen Stofan]]. The Festival has attracted many significant names in Science over the years, including [[Robert Winston]] (the first 'guest director' in 2004), [[David Puttnam]] (Director 2005), [[Jonathon Porritt]] (Director 2007), [[Adam Hart-Davis]], [[Susan Greenfield]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Lucy Hawking]], [[A. C. Grayling]], [[Tony Robinson]] and [[Richard Hammond]]. In 2014 the guest directors were BAFTA winning naturalist [[Steve Backshall]] and radio and TV presenter [[Richard Bacon (broadcaster)|Richard Bacon]]. 

==Programme==
The Cheltenham Science Festival aims to engage in entertaining, challenging and deliberately discussing controversial issues and experiences.{{cn|date=February 2014}} The 2017 programme contains over 140 events across six-days, including a number of dedicated family events. 

===Discover Zone===
A main feature of the festival is the Discover Zone. Billed as 'Interactive Science for all ages', it is a free interactive exhibition space that takes up the main space of [[Cheltenham Town Hall|Cheltenham's Town Hall]].

===FameLab===
FameLab was set up in 2005 by Cheltenham Science Festival in partnership with [[NESTA]]. In Famelab, contestants give short (maximum three minute) presentations unaided by slides on an area of science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) that they have been researching. They aim to give their presentation in a way that engages the general public, not simply scientists etc. who already have technical or specific knowledge on the area. This point is taken into account by the judging panel, usually science communicators themselves, who assess the communicators on clarity, content and communication before deciding who to put through to the next round of competition. Famelab has regional heats in its participating countries, followed by national finals and then the international finals taking place every year at Cheltenham Science Festival.   

In 2007, the competition was adopted by the [[British Council]] as one of its flagship science engagement projects, first as a South East Europe pilot. By 2010, [[Famelab]] expanded to include 14 nations across Europe, Asia and Africa, setting the stage for a growing global phenomenon. In 2015 the competition operated in 30 locations including the USA via [[NASA]], 29 of which participated in international finals in June 2015. The International Grand Final at the Cheltenham Science Festival in June 2015 was streamed on the internet throughout the world.

At Cheltenham Science Festival the International Finals of Famelab consist of three international semi-finals where judges listen to the three-minute presentations from the international finalists, then ask them questions about the topic of the contestant's talk before deliberating on which scientists to select for the international final, held at the end of the festival in the 800-seater Arena. Former [[Material World (radio programme)|Material World]] radio presenter [[Quentin Cooper]] was compere during the final.  

Over 4,000 young science communicators ("[[Famelabbers]]") have participated in Famelab competitions in their home countries, about 100 of which also represented their home countries at the Cheltenham Science Festival in the UK. It is fairly common in Famelab competitions that a Famelabber may not originate in the country they represent at the international finals, such as Bechara Saab (originally from Canada), who was the first to represent Switzerland at the International Grand Final, and Didac Carmona (originally from Spain), who represented Austria and won the International Grand Final in 2012. Famelab International 2014 was won by Pádraic Flood, originally from Ireland, representing the tripartite Benelux. 

Also at the International Final two joint runners-up are announced as decided by the final judges, an audience winner voted for by the live audience in the arena via keypad is crowned and finally an alumni award is given to the winner of a worldwide online vote by juries in all the participating Famelab nations.

The '''Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival'''  (French: '''Festival international du court métrage de Clermont-Ferrand''') is the biggest international [[film festival]] dedicated to [[short film]]s.  It is held annually in [[Clermont-Ferrand, France]], and is the second largest film festival in [[France]] after Cannes, in terms of audience and professional attendance, boasting over 160,000 attendees and 3,500 professionals annually.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiewire.com/festival/international_short_film_festival_-_clermont-ferrand&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brattlefilm.org/2012/02/28/balagan-presents-selections-from-the-clermont-ferrand-film-festival/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403125138/http://brattlefilm.org/2012/02/28/balagan-presents-selections-from-the-clermont-ferrand-film-festival/ |archivedate=2013-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  History ==
In 1979, a Short Film Week was organised by the [[University of Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont-Ferrand University]] Film Society. This event was repeated in 1980 and 1981, and was enthusiastically received.  In 1982, the Festival became competitive, with a jury attributing awards to films selected from the recent French short film production. International films were shown in special programs highlighting a particular theme, genre, country or region of the world. The audience was also presented with tributes to the great short film makers of the past and present.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clermont-filmfest.com/index.php?m=184&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the first Clermont-Ferrand Short Film Market was organized, with the intention to raise the economic profile of the short films. The market contains a video library for French and foreign television buyers, distributors and festival programmers to view the all of the films in competition, as well as the films out of competition, that were submitted for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.eurostar.com/uk/travel-to-france/travel-to-auvergne/travel-to-clermont-ferrand/discover/short-film-market-the-clermont-ferrand-international-short-film-festival-ide-63318220 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123001415/http://uk.eurostar.com/uk/travel-to-france/travel-to-auvergne/travel-to-clermont-ferrand/discover/short-film-market-the-clermont-ferrand-international-short-film-festival-ide-63318220 |archivedate=2013-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Festival ==
Clermont has been the biggest short film festival for 40 years, the essential meeting place for spectators, professionals, youngsters and school children. Audiences has a choice of 600 films, across all sections, and the three competitions (national, international and Lab). 
The programming team receives each year more than 7000 short films submissions between March and October, included 1500 French productions.

==Discoveries==

The festival has revealed many directors who then launched their film career successfully, for example:

*[[Cédric Klapisch]], winner of the Special Jury Prize in 1987 for In Transit (his graduation film ), then again the Special Jury Prize in 1990 for I am moving
*[[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]], winner of the Audience Award and Press Award in 1990 for Bullshit
*[[Jan Kounen]], Prize winning research in 1994 for Vibroboy
*[[Erick Zonca]], Grand Prix in 1995 for Eternal
*The short film [[Logorama]] which  won the Oscar for best short film at the [[82nd Academy Awards]]

'''De Kleine Komedie''' is today the oldest theatre in [[Amsterdam]], dating from 1788. Situated on the [[Amstel]] near the Halvemaansteeg, the building offers a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] for both upcoming and established Dutch talents. The theatre has 503 seats. 

==History of the building==
The first theatre built in Amsterdam was the [[Schouwburg of Van Campen]] on Keizersgracht 384 in 1637, which burned down in 1772. That theatre company then moved to the [[Leidseplein]], where it built a theatre in 1774, the first [[Stadsschouwburg (Amsterdam)|Stadsschouwburg]]. That building burned down in 1892 (the present building was built in 1894), making De Kleine Komedie the oldest surviving theatre in Amsterdam.  

In 1784 [[Henry Hope]] of [[Hope &amp; Co.]] purchased ground on the Amstel near the east side of the Halvemaansteeg in [[Amsterdam]], together with his fellow banker friends [[Balthazar Elias Abbema]], [[Pieter de Smeth]], [[Henry Fizeaux]], Jean Alexander Botereau, and  [[Pieter Muilman]].&lt;ref&gt;Website (house ownership database) of the [[Amsterdam City Archives]]&lt;/ref&gt; They commissioned the building to the architect [[Abraham van der Hart]] who completed it in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;Rijksmonument report&lt;/ref&gt; The commissioners were all very influential men of Amsterdam who had far reaching connections. Henry Fizeaux was a banker who had close ties with [[John Adams]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. He tried to raise funds for the American cause and shared [[revolutionary]] sympathies, though [[merchant]] tradition was to deny political preferences. The '[[Patriotic]]' or 'Anti-Orange' sympathies of the directors [[Henry Fizeaux]] and Jean Alexander Botereau resulted in their stepping down in 1787 when the [[House of Orange]] was re-established. Orangist [[Henry Hope]] took over the running of the establishment until he fled the country before [[Napoleon]]'s army in 1794. 

===Théâtre Français===
It was called the Théâtre Français sur l'Erwtemarkt in 1794, the year performances began. In those days, the performances were often in French and modelled on a [[Paris]]ian theater form that was very popular. [[Napoleon]] himself supported the Théâtre Français, and French [[opera]]'s and [[Play (theatre)|plays]] were shown in the theatre well into the 19th century.

When the interest in French plays decreased, the building was sold to the 'Neues Deutsches Theater' that performed German plays. In 1856 the building came into the hands of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] and was rechristened 'Scottish Missionary Church'. The driving force behind the Dutch branch of this church was the Rev. [[Carl Schwartz|August Ferdinand Carl Schwartz]] (1817–1870), the father of the novelist [[Maarten Maartens]].

When the [[Vrije Universiteit]] (Free University) of Amsterdam started in 1880, it hired some rooms in the Scottish Missionary Church and used them as lecture rooms. Here the founder [[Abraham Kuyper]] and his four co-professors gave their lectures. In 1883 the Scottish Missionary Church became too small for the quickly growing number of students and the university bought another building.

In the first half of Twentieth Century the building was called Salvatori and was used as a meeting centre. The most various groups met here, from orthodox Protestants to leftist freethinkers. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the building was no more than a bicycle shed.

===De Kleine Komedie===
In 1947 the building was reopened as a theatre, now under its present name 'De Kleine Komedie'. Since then its program is primarily in Dutch. In the Fifties and Sixties many famous people in the Dutch entertainment world, like [[Toon Hermans]], [[Wim Kan]] and [[Fons Jansen]], made appearances in this theatre. In 1973 the building was closed by the Amsterdam fire brigade due to fire hazard. After a renovation financed by private sources, it was reopened in 1978.

In 1988 the continued existence of De Kleine Komedie was put in danger again, when the municipality of Amsterdam wanted to withdraw its subsidy. A campaign launched by the cabaret performer [[Youp van 't Hek]] secured the theatre's subsidy.

Because of its cosy atmosphere De Kleine Komedie is often used for try-out performances by upcoming talents as well as long-established cabaret performers. Many DVD and TV productions are recorded here.

'''Ethchlorvynol'''{{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|θ|k|l|ɔːr|ˈ|v|aɪ|n|ɒ|l}} is a [[GABA receptor agonist|GABA-ergic]] [[sedative]] and [[hypnotic]]/[[soporific]] medication developed by [[Pfizer]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Bavley&gt;A. Bavley, W.M. McLamore, {{US Patent|2746900}} Hypnotic Agent and Method of Making the Same (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States it was sold by [[Abbott Laboratories]] under the tradename '''Placidyl'''.&lt;ref name="erowid"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.erowid.org/pharms/ethchlorvynol/ethchlorvynol.shtml | title=Erowid Ethchlorvynol Vault | publisher=Erowid | date=12 January 2007 | accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placidyl was available in 200&amp;nbsp;mg., 500&amp;nbsp;mg., and 750&amp;nbsp;mg. strength capsules.  While the 500&amp;nbsp;mg. and 750&amp;nbsp;mg. strength capsules were for use in reducing sleep latency, the 200&amp;nbsp;mg. strength capsules were intended to be used to re-induce sleep in case of early awakening.  Abbott discontinued production in 1999,due to it being replaced by the benzodiazepine family and it's widespread abuse,&lt;ref name="erowid"/&gt; after which Placidyl was available for about a year in the United States.  Although, theoretically, ethchlorvynol could be manufactured for sale in the United States by another pharmaceutical company (subject to FDA approval of such manufacture), no pharmaceutical company has chosen to do so. Individuals with a valid prescription for the substance may legally transport a reasonable amount of ethclorvynol with them into the United States.

==Use and effects==
[[Image:Ethchlorvynol DOJ.jpg|thumb|right]]
Ethchlorvynol was used to treat [[insomnia]], but prescriptions for the drug had fallen significantly by 1990, as other hypnotics that were considered safer (i.e., less dangerous in overdose) became much more common. It is no longer prescribed in the United States due to unavailability, but it is still available in some countries and would still be considered legal to possess and use with a valid prescription.

Along with expected sedative effects of relaxation and drowsiness, adverse reactions to ethchlorvynol include skin rash, faintness, restlessness and [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]]. Early adjustment side effects may include nausea and vomiting, numbness, blurred vision, stomach pains and temporary dizziness. There are no specific antidotes available for ethchlorvynol, and treatment is supportive with protocols resembling those for the treatment of [[barbiturate overdose]]. Overdose may be marked by a variety of symptoms, including confusion, fever, [[peripheral]] numbness and weakness, reduced coordination and muscle control, slurred speech, reduced heartbeat, respiratory depression, and in extreme overdoses, coma and death.

As with all [[GABAA receptor]] agonists, Placidyl can be habit forming and extremely physically addictive (with potentially lethal withdrawal resembling [[delirium tremens]] and [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]]). After prolonged use, withdrawal symptoms may include convulsions, hallucinations, and [[amnesia]]. As with most hypnotics, Placidyl was indicated for use in the treatment of insomnia for a short period of time (a week or two).  However, it was nonetheless not uncommon for doctors to prescribe Placidyl (and other hypnotics) for extended periods of time, as currently prescribed soporifics are today.

During the late 1970s, ethchlorvynol was sometimes over-prescribed causing a minor epidemic of persons who quickly became addicted to this powerful drug.  Occasional deaths would occur when addicted persons would try to inject the drug directly into a vein or an artery. Ethchlorvynol is not compatible with [[intravenous injection]] and serious injury (including the loss of limbs due to vascular injury) or death can occur when it is used in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Chemistry==
Ethchlorvynol is a member of the class of sedative-hypnotic [[carbinol]]s, which includes [[Methylpentynol|methylparafynol]] and [[2-Methyl-2-butanol|''tert''-amyl alcohol]]. It is not a [[benzodiazepine]], [[carbamate]], or [[barbiturate|barbituric acid derivative]], and its molecular structure is considerably simpler. The systematic name of ethchlorvynol is usually given as ethyl 2-chlorovinyl ethynyl carbinol or 1-chloro-3-ethylpent-1-en-4-yn-3-ol. Its empirical formula is C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;ClO.

Ethchlorvynol is synthesized by an [[Alkynylation|ethynylation]] reaction using lithium [[acetylide]] and 1-chloro-1-penten-3-one in [[liquid ammonia]], followed by acidic [[Work-up (chemistry)|work-up]].&lt;ref name=Bavley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McLamore | first1 = W.

The carbamate ester of ethchlorvynol (CAS 74283-25-3) was investigated and was shown to have a slower onset, longer duration and increased potency but was not developed commercially.

The '''Field of the Cloth of Gold''' ({{lang-fr|Camp du Drap d'Or}}) was a site in [[Balinghem]]{{spaced ndash}} between [[Ardres]] in [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Guînes]] in the then-English [[Pale of Calais]]{{spaced ndash}} that hosted a [[Summit (meeting)|summit]] from 7 to 24 June 1520, between King [[Henry VIII of England]] and King [[Francis I of France]].

The summit was arranged to increase the bond of friendship between the two kings following the [[Anglo-French treaty of 1514]]. These two monarchs would meet again in 1532 to arrange Francis's assistance in pressuring [[Pope Clement VII]] to pronounce Henry's [[Catherine of Aragon|first marriage]] as illegitimate. Under the guidance of English Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]], the chief nations of Europe sought to outlaw war forever among Christian nations.

The site is indicated by a [[commemorative plaque]] on the D231 road (Route de Marquise) at {{Coord|50.8523|N|1.9229|E|type:landmark_region:FR|display=inline,title}}. Though now in France, [[Balinghem]] was at the time regarded as [[Pale of Calais|part of England]]. This was probably the main reason for it as the choice of meeting place; being English territory but surrounded by France renders it as close to [[neutral territory]] as was practicable.

==Background==
[[File:Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.jpg|upright|thumb|Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey|Wolsey]]]]

Two entities had started to emerge as powers in Western Europe at this time: France, under Francis I, and the [[Habsburg|Habsburg Empire]], under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The [[Kingdom of England]], still a lesser power, was being courted as an ally by the two major powers. The 1518 [[Treaty of London, 1518|Treaty of London]], a [[non-aggression pact]] between major European powers, to help resist the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman expansion]] into [[southeastern Europe]], had just been signed.  Henry also held meetings with Charles V a month before the Field of Cloth of Gold in the Netherlands and again afterwards at [[Calais]], Henry's only possession on the Continent.

Both Henry and Francis wished to be seen as [[Renaissance]] princes. Renaissance thinking held that a strong prince could choose peace from a place of strength. The meeting was designed to show how magnificent each [[Noble court|court]] was, and how this could be a basis for mutual respect and peace between nations that were traditional enemies. Henry and Francis were also similar figures of similar age and dashing reputations, so there was almost certainly a mutual curiosity.

Everything was arranged to provide equality between the two groups. The meeting place was at the very edge of the English territory around Calais. The valley where the first meeting took place was landscaped to provide areas of equal elevation for the two national parties. The whole event was planned and executed by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Thomas Wolsey]], a charismatic, eloquent master [[Diplomacy|diplomat]] who as a [[papal legate]] had immense power in the name of the [[pope]] ([[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] at the time of the meeting). Included among the English guests were [[Thomas More]], and [[Anne Boleyn]]'s [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|mother]] and [[Mary Boleyn|sister]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerdan, ''Rutland Papers'', Camden Society (1842), 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier meeting between the kings of England and France presaged this one. From 27 to 30 October 1396, [[Charles VI of France]]  and [[Richard II of England]] had met at [[Ardres]] near Calais to treat for peace during the [[Hundred Years' War]].  The scale,  splendour and pageantry was comparable to the later  Field of Cloth of Gold meeting held on the same site in 1520.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.history.ac.uk/richardII/stmichael.html | contribution = Image of St Michael | title = Richard II's Treasure | publisher = Institute of Historical Research, Royal Holloway College, University of London | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2018-09-26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The meeting==
[[File:Basire Embarkation of Henry VIII.jpg|thumb|Henry VIII embarking in [[Dover]].]]
Each king tried to outshine the other, with dazzling tents and clothes, huge feasts, music, [[jousting]] and games. The tents and the costumes displayed so much [[cloth of gold]], an expensive fabric woven with silk and gold thread, that the site of the meeting was named after it.

The most elaborate arrangements were made for the accommodation of the two monarchs and their large retinues; and on Henry's part especially no efforts were spared to make a great impression in Europe with this meeting. Before the castle of [[Guînes]], a temporary palace covering an area of nearly {{convert|12000|yd2|m2}}, was erected for the reception of the English king.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Field of the Cloth of Gold |volume=10 |page=327 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palace was in four blocks with a central courtyard; each side was {{convert|328|ft|m|-2}} long. The only solid part was the brick base about {{convert|8|ft|m|0}} high.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Edward, ''Chronicle'', (1809), 605.&lt;/ref&gt; Above the brickwork, the 30-foot (10 metre) high walls were made of cloth or canvas on timber frames, painted to look like stone or brick. One further aspect of King Henry's retinue was the presence of two royal monkeys covered in gold leaf; these were known to have been gifts from the Ottoman Sultan [[Selim I]] and brought much laughter and merriment from Francis I as contemporary Cardinal Wolsey recounts, "The French King was overcome with much curiosity playing with those little knaves that did all they could to steal and pester his advisers, yet he willed them to be present at every banquet". The slanting roof was made of oiled cloth painted to give the colour of lead and the illusion of slates. Contemporaries commented especially on the huge expanse of glass, which made visitors feel they were in the open air. Chronicle descriptions make it clear the decorations, carved and painted had martial iconography;

{{quote|The foregate of the same palace or place with great and mighty masonry by sight was arched, with a Tower on every side of the same portered by great craft, and inbatteled was the gate and Tower, and in the fenesters, and windows, were images resembling men of warre redie to cast great stones: also the same gate or Tower was set with compassed images of ancient Princes, as Hercules, Alexander and other, by entrayled worke, richly limned with gold and Albyn colours, .... also the tower of the Gate as seemed was built by great masonry, ... for the sundrie countenances of every Image that their appeared, some shooting, some casting, some ready to strike, and firing of gonnes, which shewed very honourably.|''Grafton's Chronicle, or Chronicle at Large'' 1569&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Grafton|Grafton, Richard]], ''Grafton's Chronicle, or Chronicle at Large'' 1569, vol. 2, London (1809), 303–304: Hall, Edward, ''Chronicle'', (1809), 605.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The building was decorated in the most sumptuous fashion and furnished with a profusion of golden ornaments.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Red wine flowed from the two [[fountain]]s outside. The chapel was served by 35 [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]]. Composer [[Jean Mouton]] was most likely in charge of the musical production by Francis I; the French royal chapel had one of the finest choirs in Europe, and contemporary accounts indicated that they "delighted their hearers."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave Reese]], ''Music in the Renaissance'', p. 291. New York, W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1954. {{ISBN|0-393-09530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wooden ceiling for one of the tents may later have been installed in the New Chapel at [[Ightham Mote]] where, with its colours faded, one with appropriate features can still be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, N. &amp; Fawcett, E. ''Ightham Mote''. National Trust (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Musical production on the English side was probably led by composer [[William Cornysh]] the Younger, master of the Royal Chapel for Henry VIII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoasm.org/IVM/CornyshJr.html|title=HOASM: William Cornysh 'junior'|website=www.hoasm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some idea of the size of Henry's following may be gathered from the fact that in one month 2200 sheep and other viandes in a similar proportion were consumed. In the fields beyond the castle, 2800 tents were erected for less distinguished visitors.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Journeying from Calais, Henry reached his headquarters at Guînes on 4 June 1520, and Francis took up his residence at Ardres. After Cardinal Wolsey, with a splendid train, had visited the French king, the two monarchs met at the Val d'Or, a spot midway between the two places, on 7 June.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The following days were taken up with tournaments, in which both kings took part.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; There were banquets in which the kings entertained each other's queens. The many other entertainments included archery displays and wrestling between Breton and Cornish wrestlers.
[[File:TapestryHenriFrancois.jpg|thumb|Wrestling at the Field of the Cloth of Gold (Tapestry, c. 1520)]]

Wolsey said [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the two sovereigns separated on 24 June, [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]. The painting depicts a dragon flying overhead and this could be interpreted to mean that the Mass itself was interrupted by a mysterious event thought to be a [[dragon]] or [[salamander]] flying over the congregation. The superstitious would have viewed this as a great portent, but it was probably a [[Fireworks|firework]] accidentally or deliberately set off. Alternatively the dragon in the painting could be interpreted as symbolic. The sermon was read by [[Richard Pace]], an intimate friend of [[Erasmus]]. Wolsey gave a general [[indulgence]] for all present.

==Consequences==
This meeting made a great impression on contemporaries, but its political results were very small.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; While the carefully established rules of the tournament stated that the two kings would not compete against each other, Henry surprisingly challenged Francis in a wrestling match, but it turned sour for Henry when he quickly lost.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Watts, [http://www.royalarmouries.org/assets-uploaded/documents/KWatts_Web.pdf Tournaments at the court of King Henry VIII]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between the two countries worsened soon after the event when Cardinal Wolsey arranged an alliance with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who declared war on France later that year commencing the [[Italian War of 1521–26]].

==List of participants==
A record of the list of participants survives in at least two places: in the [[Rutland Papers]]&lt;ref&gt;Jerdan, William (ed.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bsy54OmSC6cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Rutland Papers: Original Documents Illustrative of the Courts and Times of Henry VII and Henry VIII Selected from the Private Archives of His Grace the Duke of Rutland]'', London, 1842, pp.28–49; corrected and amended, but omits listings by county&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, of King Henry VIII,&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, J.

In [[Christian tradition]], the '''Five Holy Wounds''' also known as the '''Five Sacred Wounds''' or the '''Five Precious Wounds''' are the five piercing wounds [[Jesus Christ]] suffered during the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. The wounds have been the focus of particular devotions, especially in the late [[Middle Ages]], and have often been reflected in church music and art.

==History==
While in the course of his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] Jesus suffered various wounds, such as those from the [[crown of thorns]] and from the [[Scourging of Jesus|scourging at the pillar]]. Medieval popular piety focused upon the five wounds associated directly with Christ's crucifixion, i.e., the nail wounds on his hands and feet as well as the lance wound which pierced his side.

The revival of religious life and the zealous activity of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and [[Francis of Assisi]] in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, together with the enthusiasm of the Crusaders returning from the Holy Land, gave a rise to devotion to the Passion of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name=holweck&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15714a.htm Holweck, Frederick. "The Five Sacred Wounds." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 1 Jun. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many medieval prayers in honour of the Sacred Wounds, including some attributed to [[Clare of Assisi]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/princessofpovert00fieg#page/n373/mode/2up Fiege O. M. Cap., Marianus. ''Princess of Poverty, Saint Clare of Assisi'', p.305, Poor Clares of the Monastery of S. Clare, Evansville, Indiana, 1900]&lt;/ref&gt; have been preserved. St. [[Mechtilde]] and St. [[Gertrude the Great|Gertrude of Helfta]] were devoted to the Holy Wounds, the latter saint reciting daily a prayer in honour of the 5466 wounds, which, according to a medieval tradition, were inflicted on Jesus during His Passion. In the fourteenth century it was customary in southern Germany to recite fifteen Pater Nosters each day (which thus amounted to 5475 in the course of a year) in memory of the Sacred Wounds.

There was in the medieval Missals a special Mass in honour of Christ's Wounds, known as the Golden Mass, During its celebration five candles were always lighted and it was popularly held that if anyone should say or hear it on five consecutive days he should never suffer the pains of hell fire.&lt;ref name=holweck/&gt;

The Dominican Rosary also helped to promote devotion to the Sacred Wounds, for while the fifty small beads refer to Mary, the five large beads and the corresponding Pater Nosters are intended to honour the Five Wounds of Christ. Again, in some places it was customary to ring a bell at noon on Fridays, to remind the faithful to recite five Paters and Aves in honour of the Holy Wounds.&lt;ref name=holweck/&gt;

==The wounds==
[[File:Augustinermuseum Rattenberg 018.JPG|thumb|210px|Christ after his Resurrection, with the ''ostentatio vulnerum'', showing his wounds, Austria, c. 1500]]
[[File:Fra Angelico 027.jpg|thumb|200px|The piercing of Jesus's side by the [[Holy Lance]] of [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]], [[fresco]] by [[Fra Angelico]] (1395–1455), San Marco, Florence]]

The five wounds comprised one through each hand or wrist, one through each foot, and one to the chest.

* Two of the wounds were through either his hands or his wrists, where nails were inserted to fix [[Jesus]] to the cross-beam of the cross on which he was crucified. According to [[forensic medicine| forensic]] expert [[Frederick Zugibe|Frederick T. Zugibe]], the most plausible region for the nail entry site in the case of Jesus is the upper part of the palm angled toward the wrist since this area can easily support the weight of the body, assures no bones are broken, marks the location where most people believed it to be, accounts for where most of the [[Stigmata|stigmatists]] have displayed their wounds and it is where artists through the centuries have designated it. This position would result in apparent lengthening of the fingers of the hand because of compression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crucifixion-shroud.com/Barbet.htm Zugibe M.D., Frederick T., "The Crucifixion of Jesus, Second Edition, Completely Revised and Expanded: A Forensic Inquiry" Publisher: M. Evans and Company, Inc.; 2nd edition (May 25, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two were through the feet where the nail(s)&lt;ref&gt;In [[Eastern Christianity]], the crucificion is traditionally depicted with Jesus' feet side by side, and a separate nail for each; in Western Christianity, the [[crucifix]] usually shows the two feet placed one above the other, and both pierced by a single nail.&lt;/ref&gt; passed through both to the vertical beam.&lt;ref&gt;Of all the thousands crucified by the Romans, skeletal remains of only one have so far been discovered by archeologists, and that one showed a nail piercing through the heel.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The final wound was in the side of Jesus' chest, where, according to the [[New Testament]], his body was pierced by the [[Holy Lance|Lance of Longinus]] in order to be sure that he was dead. The [[Gospel of John]] states that blood and water poured out of this wound ({{bible verse||John|19:34|KJV}}). Although the Gospels do not specify on which side he was wounded, it was conventionally shown in art as being on Jesus's [[proper right]] side, though some depictions, notably a number by [[Rubens]], show it on the [[proper left]].&lt;ref&gt;Gurewich, Vladimir, "Rubens and the Wound in Christ's Side. A Postscript", ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol. 26, No. 3/4 (1963), p.&amp;nbsp;358, The Warburg Institute, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/750501 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The examination of the wounds by "[[Doubting Thomas]]" the [[Apostle]], reported only in the [[Gospel of John]] at [[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/John#20:24|John 20:24-29]], was the focus of much commentary and often depicted in art, where the subject has the formal name of the [[Incredulity of Thomas]].

[[File:St Alphonsus Liguori.jpg|thumb|left|St Alphonsus Liguori]]
In his 1761 book, ''The Passion and Death of Jesus Christ'', Saint [[Alphonsus Maria de Liguori]], founder of the [[Redemptorist|Redemptorist Fathers]], listed among various pious exercises, the ''[[Chaplet of the Five Wounds of Jesus|Little Chaplet of the Five Wounds of Jesus Crucified]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/passiondeathofje00ligu#page/472/mode/2up Liguori, Alfonso Maria de, Saint. ''The Passion and Death of Jesus Christ'', p.472, Benziger Brothers, New York, 1887]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Passionist]] [[Chaplet of the Five Wounds]] was developed in Rome in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpprovince.org/archives/thepassionist/chaplet-5wounds.php Womack C.P.A., Rev. Fr. Warren. "The Passionist", Dec. 1951, pp. 270-274, 333-334]&lt;/ref&gt; A corona of the Five Wounds was approved by the Holy See on 11 August 1823, and again in 1851. It consists of five divisions, each composed of five Glories in honour of Christ's Wounds and one Ave in commemoration of the Sorrowful Mother. The blessing of the beads is reserved to the Passionists.&lt;ref name=holweck/&gt;

The ''[[Marie Martha Chambon|Rosary of the Holy Wounds]]'' (also called the ''Chaplet of Holy Wounds''), was first introduced at the beginning of the 20th century by the Venerable Sister [[Marie Martha Chambon]], a lay [[Roman Catholic]] Sister of the ''Monastery of the Visitation Order'' in [[Chambéry]], France.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolic use==
[[File:Portugal flag.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Flag of Portugal]], the white dots inside the blue shields represent the Holy Wounds]]
As early as 1139 [[Afonso I of Portugal]] put the emblem of the five wounds on his coat of arms as king of Portugal.

The [[Cross of Jerusalem]], or "Crusaders’ Cross", remembers the Five wounds through its five crosses. The Holy Wounds have been used as a symbol of [[Christianity]]. Participants in the [[Crusades]] would often wear the [[Jerusalem cross]], an emblem representing the Holy Wounds; a version is still in use today in the [[flag of Georgia (country)|flag of Georgia]]. The "Five Wounds" was the emblem of the "[[Pilgrimage of Grace]]", a northern English [[rebellion]] in response to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]].

When [[consecration|consecrating]] an [[altar]] a number of Christian churches [[anoint]] it in five places, indicative of the Five Holy Wounds. [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Orthodox church (building)|churches]] will sometimes have five domes on them, symbolizing the Five Holy Wounds, along with the alternate symbolism of Christ and the [[Four Evangelists]].

==In sacred music==
The medieval poem ''Salve mundi salutare'' (also known as the ''Rhythmica oratio'') was formerly ascribed to [[St. Bonaventure]] or [[Bernard of Clairvaux]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13408a.htm Henry, Hugh. "Salve Mundi Salutare." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 2 Mar. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; but now is thought more likely to have been written by the Cistercian abbot [[Arnulf of Leuven]] (d. 1250). A lengthy meditation upon the Passion of Christ, it is composed of seven parts, each pertaining to one of the members of Christ's crucified body.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qSXGOoambNcC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=salve+mundi+salutare&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L8D0VKibA8mxggTNsoF4&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=salve%20mundi%20salutare&amp;f=false Snyder, Kerala. J., ''Dieterich Buxtehude: Organist in Lübeck'', University Rochester Press, 1987] {{ISBN|9781580462532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular in the 17th-century, it was arranged as a cycle of seven cantatas in 1680 by [[Dieterich Buxtehude]]. His 1680 "[[Membra Jesu Nostri]]" is divided into seven parts, each addressed to a different member of Christ's crucified body: feet, knees, hands, side, breast, heart, and head framed by selected Old Testament verses containing prefigurements.

The cantata has come down to us more widely known as the hymn [[O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden|O Sacred Head Surrounded]] named for the closing stanza of poem addressed to Christ's head which begins "Salve caput cruentatum." Translated by Lutheran hymnist [[Paul Gerhardt]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] arranged the melody and used five stanzas of the hymn in his "St Matthew Passion". Franz Liszt included an arrangement of this hymn at the sixth station, Saint Veronica wipes the Holy Face, in his ''[[Via crucis (Liszt)|Via crucis]]'' (Stations of the Cross).

==In art==
[[Image:Caravaggio - The Incredulity of Saint Thomas.jpg|thumb|''[[The Incredulity of Saint Thomas (Caravaggio)|The Incredulity of Saint Thomas]]'' by [[Caravaggio]]]]
In art the subject of [[Doubting Thomas]], or the ''Incredulity of Saint Thomas'', has been common since at least the early 6th century, when it appears in the [[mosaic]]s at [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]] in [[Ravenna]],&lt;ref&gt;Soper, 188, listing several other early occurrences&lt;/ref&gt; and on the [[Monza ampullae]]. Among the most famous examples are the sculpted pair of ''[[Christ and St. Thomas (Verrocchio)|Christ and St. Thomas]]'' by [[Andrea del Verrocchio]] (1467–1483) for the [[Orsanmichele]] in [[Florence]] and ''[[The Incredulity of Saint Thomas (Caravaggio)|The Incredulity of Saint Thomas]]'' by [[Caravaggio]], now in [[Potsdam]].

In the later Middle Ages Jesus with one side of his robe pulled back, displaying the wound in his side and his other four wounds (called the '''''ostentatio vulnerum''''', "display of the wounds"), was taken from images with the Doubting Thomas and turned into a pose adopted by Jesus alone, who often places his own fingers into the wound in his side. This form became a common feature of single iconic figures of Jesus and subjects such as the ''[[Last Judgement]]'' (where [[Bamberg Cathedral]] has an early example of about 1235), ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'', the ''[[Man of Sorrows]]'' and Christ with the ''[[Arma Christi]]'', and was used to emphasize Christ's suffering as well as the fact of his Resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, Vol 2, 188-189, 202&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formula One Air Racing''' is an [[United States|American]] [[motorsport]] that involves small [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] using engines up to 200 cubic inches in displacement. Racers can reach speeds over 200&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Popular Mechanics|title=Comeback of the National Air Races|author=Thorn Bacon|date=Sep 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Formula One air racing is sanctioned by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|International Aeronautics Federation]].
Formula One was first proposed in 1936 as "midget racing". The 190 Cubic in specification was set in 1946, and the first competition was set in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airracinghistory.freeola.com/Formula%20One%20Air%20Racing.htm |title=Formula One Air Racing |publisher=Airracinghistory.freeola.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 1930s air racers, like the [[Chester Jeep]] and [[Loose Special]] were retrofitted with smaller engines to compete. With the introduction of the [[Continental O-200]] engine, the maximum engine displacement was raised to 200 cubic inches in 1968. Aircraft must have a minimum wing area of {{convert|66|sqft|m2}}, and an empty weight of 500 pounds or more. The aircraft must also have fixed landing gear, and a fixed pitch propeller. Racers compete in a {{convert|3.19|mi|km|adj=on}} Oval course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airrace.org/classF1.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809123132/http://www.airrace.org/classF1.php |date=August 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several aircraft were capable of meeting the specifications for Formula One at its creation. Specific designs were introduced shortly after that maximized speed for the configuration.

==Academic career==

His research interests include [[macroeconomics]], [[economic history]], [[labour economics]], international macroeconomics and the macroeconomics of [[monetary union]]s.&lt;ref name=personal /&gt;

==Political career==

Chouliarakis has served as Chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers (Greece)|Council of Economic Advisers]] (SOE), and in this capacity has accompanied ministers, such as [[Euclid Tsakalotos]], to meetings in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tsakalotos and Houliarakis to attend Brussels Group talks on Monday|url=http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=711278|accessdate=27 August 2015|work=To Vima|date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been described as an "ally" of the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Greece]], [[Yannis Dragasakis]].&lt;ref name=trasmi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Helena|last2=Traynor|first2=Ian|title=Greek finance minister denies being sidelined from debt talks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/28/greek-finance-minister-denies-being-sidelined-at-debt-talks|accessdate=27 August 2015|work=The Guardian|date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April 2015, Chouliarakis was brought in as the chief Greek negotiator in the team negotiating the terms of the [[Third bailout package (Greece)|third bailout package]]. He replaced [[Nicholas Theocarakis]], who was considered an ally of [[Yanis Varoufakis]]. Chouliarakis was praised by Thomas Wieser, the president of the [[European Union|EU]]'s [[Economic and Financial Committee (European Union)|Economic and Financial Committee]], as being a "gifted negotiator".&lt;ref name=latitude&gt;{{cite news|last1=Papadimitriou|first1=Yanis|title=Changes in latitude, changes in attitude|url=http://www.dw.com/en/changes-in-latitude-changes-in-attitude/a-18416051|accessdate=27 August 2015|work=Deutsche Welle|date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been called "the invisible negotiator" by some of the [[Athens]] media due to being notoriously media-shy.&lt;ref name="invisible"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maltezou|first1=Renee|title=Greece's 'invisible negotiator' may assuage bailout fears in election run-up|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/08/31/uk-eurozone-greece-bailout-finance-idUKKCN0R01F520150831|accessdate=6 September 2015|work=Reuters|date=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' described him as a "constructive interlocutor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-names-george-chouliarakis-as-interim-finance-minister-1440755754|title = Greece Names George Chouliarakis Interim Finance Minister|last = Bouras|first = Stelios|date = 28 August 2015|work = The Wall Street Journal|access-date = 16 January 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2015, Chouliarakis was sworn in as the interim [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Minister of Finance]] in the [[Caretaker Cabinet of Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou]], replacing [[Euclid Tsakalotos]]. His appointment was praised by [[Jeroen Dijsselbloem]], the president of the [[Eurogroup]], who said: "[Chouliarakis] knows what he's doing because he was top man in the ministry for the past year and half." Tsakalotos also praised his successor, saying: "I am certain that with his work, as always, and with his devotion to the public good it would be difficult to think of a better interim finance minister, someone who loves what he does and does it very well."&lt;ref name="invisible" /&gt;

Following the September legislative election and the formation of the [[Second Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|second Tsipras cabinet]], Chouliarakis was re-appointed to the Ministry of Finance as an Alternate Minister of Finance, serving under Tsakalotos as Minister of Finance. His responsibilities included overseeing the national accounts office, "a post seen as critical to achieving the ambitious fiscal targets set by the bailout programme" according to the ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/38408e36-6175-11e5-9846-de406ccb37f2.html|title = Tsipras appoints top negotiators to new cabinet|last = Hope|first = Kerin|date = 23 September 2015|work = Financial Times|access-date = 16 January 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chouliarakis, in his capacity as an Alternate Minister of Finance, is also a member of the Board of Directors of the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF).&lt;ref name="efsf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.efsf.europa.eu/about/corporate-governance/index.htm|website=European Financial Stability Facility|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chouliarakis has also resumed the role of Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors (SOE), and in that capacity is a member of the Board of Directors of the Greek [[Public Debt Management Agency (Greece)|Public Debt Management Agency]].&lt;ref name="pdma"&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.pdma.gr/index.php/en/agency-pdma/board-of-directors|website=Public Debt Management Agency|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1473">'''Hands On USA''' ('''HOUSA'''), now [[All Hands Volunteers]], was a relief project established to help victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. HOUSA was organized by the non-profit relief organization Hands On Disaster Response.

HOUSA was formed the week after [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]].

Entrepreneurs David Campbell and [[Darius A. Monsef]] co-founded HOUSA after meeting in [[Thailand]] while both were doing relief work following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Tsunami]]. Campbell served as the Executive Director for the Katrina Relief Project and Darius served as the Operations Director.  Three months into the project Marc A. Young joined HOUSA as a second Operations Director.

After four months of work in [[Mississippi]], HOUSA handed their volunteer operation over to [[Hands On Network]], based in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  This operation was named Hands On Gulf Coast, which continued to operate a volunteer center out of the Beauvoir Methodist Church in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] until February 2009.

"'''Israel's Son'''" is a song by Australian [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Silverchair]], released in 1995. It was the third single released from their debut full-length album, ''[[Frogstomp]]'', which was released earlier the same year. It was also released on their ''[[The Best of Volume 1 (Silverchair album)|The Best of Volume 1]]'', and used on the soundtrack to the western version of ''[[Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie]]''.

It is the only ''Frogstomp'' song the band still played live in the years prior to the band going into "indefinite hibernation” in 2011. The song was taken half a step down, likely to compensate for [[Daniel Johns]]' changing vocals. 

"Israel's Son" is one of four songs on the album written solely by Johns.

==Murder trial==
&lt;!--Note: This has been directly copied from the Silverchair article.--&gt;
In a January 1996 murder case, the defendant counsel for Brian Bassett, 16, and Nicholaus McDonald, 18, claimed that the pair listened to "Israel's Son", from ''Frogstomp'', which contributed to the murder of Bassett's parents and a younger brother on August 10, 1995.&lt;ref name="KitSap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SeattlePI"/&gt; McDonald's lawyer cited the lyrics "'Hate is what I feel for you/I want you to know that I want you dead'" which were "almost a script. They're relevant to everything that happened".&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62R5UbqYR?url=http://webspace.webring.com/people/gu/um_11847/article/kerrang9.html |url=http://webspace.webring.com/people/gu/um_11847/article/kerrang9.html |last1=Elliott |first1=Paul |title=Roo Fighters |work=[[Kerrang!]] |publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]] |year=1997 |archivedate=14 October 2011 |accessdate=15 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The band's manager, John Watson, was quoted when he made this statement on behalf of the band, Silverchair:

"Silverchair do not, have not, and never would condone violence of any sort. The band is appalled by this horrific crime and they hope that justice will prevail in prosecuting whoever is responsible for it. The band extends its sincere sympathies to the families and friends of the victims in this case. Silverchair absolutely rejects any allegation that their song is in any way responsible for the actions of the alleged murders. It is a matter of public record that the song in question, Israel's Son, was inspired by a television documentary about wartime atrocities. Israel's Son was never intended to provoke violence and cannot be interpreted by an reasonable person as doing so. In fact, the song seeks to criticise violence and war by portraying them in all their horror."

The band's manager, Watson, issued a statement that they did not condone nor intend any such acts of violence, "The band is appalled by this horrific crime, and they hope that justice will prevail".&lt;ref name="SeattlePI"&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62R4yvdv8?url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64653616.html |title=Attorney wants to open teen's murder trial with rock song |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] |date=18 January 1996 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64653616.html |archivedate=14 October 2011 |accessdate=15 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; Prosecutors rejected the defence&lt;!-- Australian English has defence not defense --&gt; case and convinced the jury that the murder was committed to "steal money and belongings and run off to California."&lt;ref name="KitSap"&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62R4VvWMX?url=http://m.kitsapsun.com/news/1996/feb/22/teen-sentenced-to-65-years-for-his-part-in/ |url=http://m.kitsapsun.com/news/1996/feb/22/teen-sentenced-to-65-years-for-his-part-in/ |title=Teen Sentenced to 65 Years for His Part in Murders |work=[[Kitsap Sun]] |publisher=[[E.

}}'''Joseph Inkerman Johnson''' was born in 1914 in [[Hulcote, Northamptonshire]]. He joined the [[RAF]] in June 1935 as an Aircrafthand (Carpenter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesoutheastecho.co.uk/Pilots/Johnson_JI.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003031016/http://www.thesoutheastecho.co.uk/Pilots/Johnson_JI.htm |archivedate=2011-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later remustered as an Airman-in training Pilot and won his wings on 11 August 1939 — three weeks before Britain declared war on Germany.

In May 1940 Sgt. Johnson was posted to [[No. 222 Squadron RAF|222 Squadron]]. In June he claimed the 'probable' destruction of a He 111 over [[Dunkirk]]. By August 1940 he had flown 25 missions. The squadron was posted to [[RAF Hornchurch]] on 29 August 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Battle of Britain Squadrons http://www.raf.mod.uk/bob1940/213to236.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day no. 222 Squadron was scrambled several times during the day, and at 16:00 hours to intercept a large formation of bombers in the direction of the Thames Estuary and were attacked by the escorting fighters. Flying a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire Mk 1]], ''R6628'' Johnson was shot down at 18:02 by a [[Bf 109|Messerschmitt Bf 109]]&lt;ref&gt;Battle of Britain Historical Society http://www.battleofbritain1940.net/0031.html&lt;/ref&gt; and crashed near [[Bishopsbourne]], south of [[Canterbury]] in Kent.&lt;ref&gt;RAF Hornchurch - The Human Story http://www.rafhornchurch.thehumanjourney.net/squadrons.htm#222&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Johnson died before the crash.

Johnson is buried in [[Towcester]] Cemetery in [[Northamptonshire]]. His grave is Row G, Grave 2&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth War Graves Commission http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2949658&lt;/ref&gt; and it gives his service number — 520406.&lt;ref&gt;Bishopsbourne Spitfire http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~nog/personal/spitfire.htm Originally published in the [[Kingston, Kent|Kingston]] parish magazine based on research conducted at The Battle of Britain Museum, Hawkinge by M Joplin, a local historian&lt;/ref&gt; His name is included on the [[Battle of Britain Memorial, Capel-le-Ferne|Battle of Britain Memorial at Capel-le-Ferne]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3515">The {{nihongo|'''Kunekune'''|くねくね}} is a fictitious being created on [[Japan]]ese [[Internet]] sites as an [[Japanese urban legend|urban legend]], similar to the infamous [[Slender Man]]. It was first mentioned in 2003 on several websites at the same time. On these websites, the Kunekune is considered to be a "modern [[Yōkai]]".

== Description ==
The Kunekune is said to resemble a long, slender, white and humanoid shape, like a paper mannequin or a piece of fine fabric. It is said that the being can be found at lunchtime during hot summer days. The Kunekune lingers in widely extended rice fields or acres, in rare cases it might be found over the open sea. Its limbs are said to wiggle permanently, as if there was a straight gust of wind, even if it was a windless day. This behaviour gave the being the Japanese name "Kunekune", meaning "to twist", "to wiggle" or "to meander".&lt;ref name=RFT&gt;Richard Freeman: ''The Great Yokai Encylopaedia: The A-Z of Japanese Monsters''. CFZ Press, Myrtle Cottage, Bideford 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-905723-54-6}}, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YST&gt;Yamaguchi Satoshi Taro: 本当にいる日本の「現代妖怪」図鑑. Ryukura Verlag, Tokyo 2007, {{ISBN|4773003650}}, p. 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IRU&gt;Ito Ryuhei: 「ネット怪談「くねくね. In: 世間話研究, 18. Ausgabe. Smalltalk Study Group, Kyoto 2008, p. 55-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kunekune allegedly can only be seen from a distance. In the countryside, it looks snow white. In a city, it looks pitch black. If someone tries to look at it up close, he will go insane. If someone touches it, or simply comes too close, the Kunekune will kill its victim. If someone instead just leaves, the Kunekune will ignore the person.&lt;ref name=RFT/&gt;&lt;ref name=YST/&gt;&lt;ref name=IRU/&gt;

== Background ==
First mention of the Kunekune appeared in 2003 at several websites at the same time. These websites deal with made-up stories concerning ghosts, demons and other kinds of spooks. Soon after first published reports, Kunekune-believers began to write and collect their own (mostly made up) stories. These are all written in the first person singular in attempt to make them look like eye-witness reports. A similar phenomenon can be observed with the case of the infamous [[Slender Man]] and with [[Hanako-san]].&lt;ref name=RFT/&gt;&lt;ref name=YST/&gt;&lt;ref name=IRU/&gt;

The appearance of the Kunekune may be the result of confusion with [[tradition]]al [[Scarecrow|scarecrows]], which are found in fields of [[rice]] and [[barley]]. Scarecrows are seen in Japan as very scary and many local ghost stories claim that scarecrows come to life during the night, or if one stares at them too long. Another possible explanation might be thick fog clouds, which appear over the fields during lunchtime. A third possibility might be hallucinations, created by [[heat stroke]] and dehydration during hot summer days.&lt;ref name=RFT/&gt;&lt;ref name=YST/&gt;&lt;ref name=IRU/&gt;

The '''Liberty Alliance Project''' was an organization formed in September 2001 to establish standards, guidelines and best practices for [[identity management]] in computer systems. 
It grew to more than 150 organizations, including technology vendors, consumer-facing companies, educational organizations and governments. 
It released frameworks for federation, identity assurance, an [[Identity Governance Framework]], and Identity Web Services. 

By 2009, the [[Kantara Initiative]] took over the work of the Liberty Alliance.

==History==
The group was originally conceived and named by [[Jeff Veis]], at [[Sun Microsystems]] based in [[Menlo Park, California]].&lt;ref name="veis"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Jeff Veis: Vice President, Marketing, Protect Solutions, Autonomy |publisher= Hewlett-Packard Company |work= Executive biography |url= http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press_kits/2012/HPDiscover2012/Jeff_Veis_Bio.pdf |accessdate= November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative's goal, which was personally promoted by [[Scott McNealy]] of Sun, was to unify technology, commercial and government organizations to create a standard for federated, identity-based Internet applications as an alternative to technology appearing in the marketplace controlled by a single entity such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Microsoft account|Passport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Do Androids Dream of Electric Single Sign-Ons? Sun's Passport-killer six months away |author= Andrew Orlowski |work= The Register |date= October 24, 2001 |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/10/24/do_androids_dream_of_electric/ |accessdate= November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another Microsoft initiative, [[Microsoft HailStorm|HailStorm]], was renamed My Services but quietly shelved by April 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Microsoft Has Quietly Shelved Its Internet 'Persona' Service |author= John Markoff |work= The New York Times |date= April 11, 2002 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/11/business/technology-microsoft-has-quietly-shelved-its-internet-persona-service.html |accessdate= November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sun positioned the group as independent, and [[Eric C. Dean]] of [[United Airlines]] became its president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= New Economy: In a shift in the technology business, customers are now the kingmakers |author= Steve Lohr |work= The New York Times |date= April 1, 2002 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/01/business/new-economy-shift-technology-business-customers-are-now-kingmakers.html |accessdate= November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Identity federation===

[[Image:Liberty-protocol-history.jpg |thumb |right |upright=1.5 |Liberty Alliance 2002–2005]]

In July 2002, the alliance announced Liberty Identity Federation (ID-FF) 1.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title= Industry Leaders Release Details Of Anticipated Liberty Alliance-Enabled Products |publisher= Liberty Alliance |date= July 15, 2002  |url= http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/news_events/press_releases/industry_leaders_release_details_of_anticipated_liberty_alliance_enabled_products |accessdate= November 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time, several member companies announced upcoming availability of Liberty-enabled products.
Liberty Federation allowed consumers and users of Internet-based services and e-commerce applications to authenticate and sign-on to a network or domain once from any device and then visit or take part in services from multiple Web sites. This federated approach did not require the user to re-authenticate and can support privacy controls established by the user.

The Liberty Alliance subsequently released two more versions of the Identity Federation Framework, and then in November 2003, Liberty contributed its final version of the specification, ID-FF&amp;nbsp;1.2, to [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/strategic_initiatives/federation/?f=liberty/strategic_initiatives/federation |title=Liberty Strategic Initiatives: Federation |publisher=Liberty Alliance |accessdate=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contribution formed the basis for [[SAML 2.0]]. By 2007, industry analyst firm [[Gartner]] claimed that SAML had gained wide acceptance in the community.&lt;ref name="gartner"&gt;{{cite report|title=The U.S. Government's Adoption of SAML&amp;nbsp;2.0 Shows Wide Acceptance|date=October 29, 2007|author=Gregg Kreizman|author2=John Pescatore|author3=Ray Wagner|publisher=Gartner, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity web services===
Liberty Alliance releasing the Liberty Identity Web Services Framework ([[ID-WSF]]) in April 2004 for deploying and managing identity-based web services. Applications included geo-location, contact book, calendar, mobile messaging and People Service, for managing social applications such as bookmarks, blogs, calendars, photo sharing and instant messaging in a secure and privacy-respecting federated social network. 
In a 2008 marketing report recommended considering it for federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher= Burton Group |title= Federated Identity |author= Bob Blakley |date= October 2008 |url= http://www.burtongroup.com/Client/Research/Document.aspx?cid=719 }}&lt;!-- not archived and pay site? --&gt;{{Dead link |date= November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Certification ===
The alliance introduced a certification program in 2003, designed to test commercial and open source products against published standards to assure base levels of interoperability between products. In 2007, the US [[General Services Administration]] began requiring this certification for participating in the US E-Authentication Identity Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title= US GSA Requires Liberty Alliance Interoperability Testing as Public Sector SAML 2.0 Adoption Soars |publisher= Liberty Alliance |date= October 29, 2007 |url= http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/news_events/press_releases/us_gsa_requires_liberty_alliance_interoperability_testing_as_public_sector_saml_2_0_adoption_soars |accessdate= November 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Openliberty.org===
In January 2007, the alliance announced a project for [[open-source software]] developers building identity-based applications. OpenLiberty.org was a portal where developers can collaborate  and access tools and information to develop applications based on alliance standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title= Liberty Alliance Announces openLiberty Project  |publisher= Liberty Alliance |date= January 23, 2007 |url= http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/news_events/press_releases/liberty_alliance_announces_openliberty_project  |accessdate= November 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2008, OpenLiberty released an open source [[application programming interface]] called ArisID.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title= OpenLiberty.org Releases First Open Source Identity Governance Framework Software |publisher= Liberty Alliance |date= November 19, 2008 |url= http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/news_events/press_releases/openliberty_org_releases_first_open_source_identity_governance_framework_software |accessdate= November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity governance framework===
In February 2007 [[Oracle Corporation]] contributed the [[Identity Governance Framework]] to the alliance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title= Liberty Alliance and Oracle Team to Advance Identity Governance Framework |publisher= Liberty Alliance |date=February 7, 2007 |url= http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/news_events/press_releases/liberty_alliance_and_oracle_team_to_advance_identity_governance_framework  |accessdate= November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which released the first version publicly in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title= Industry Leaders Submit Identity Governance Framework to openLiberty.org for Development of Open Source Implementations |publisher= Liberty Alliance |date=February 7, 2007 |url= http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/news_events/press_releases/industry_leaders_submit_identity_governance_framework_to_openliberty_org_for_development_of_open_source_implementations |accessdate= November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Identity Governance Framework defined how identity related information is used, stored, and propagated using protocols such as [[LDAP]], Security Assertion Markup Language, [[WS-Trust]], and ID-WSF.

===Identity assurance framework===
The Liberty Alliance began work on its [[identity assurance]] framework in 2008. The Identity Assurance Framework (IAF) detailed four identity assurance levels designed to link trusted identity-enabled enterprise, social networking and Web applications together based on business rules and security risks associated with each level. The four levels of assurance were outlined by a 2006 document from the US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title= Electronic Authentication Guideline |author1= William E. Burr |author2= Donna F. Dodson |author3=W. Timothy Polk |date= April 2006 |publisher= US Institute of Standards and Technology |work= Special Publication 800-63 version 1.0.1 |url= http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63/SP800-63V1_0_2.pdf  |accessdate= November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The level of assurance provided is measured by the strength and rigor of the identity proofing process, the credential's strength, and the management processes the service provider applies to it. 
These four assurance levels were adopted by UK, Canada, and USA government services.

===Concordia project===
In 2007 the Liberty Alliance helped to found the [[Project Concordia]], an independent initiative for harmonization identity specifications. It was active through 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Concordia |work= Old web site |url= http://www.projectconcordia.org/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080518073504/http://www.projectconcordia.org/ |dead-url= yes |archive-date= May 18, 2008 |accessdate= November 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy and policy===
The alliance wrote papers on business and policy aspects of identity management..&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Papers |work= Promotional web site |url= http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/resource_center/papers publishing business and policy |accessdate= November 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It hosted meetings in 2007 and 2008 to promote itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Privacy Summits |work= Promotional web site |url= http://www.projectliberty.org/liberty/public_community/privacy_summits |accessdate= November 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===
Management board members included [[AOL]], [[British Telecom]], [[Computer Associates]] (CA), [[Fidelity Investments]], [[Intel]], [[Internet Society]] (ISOC), [[Novell]], [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]] (NTT), Oracle Corporation and Sun Microsystems.

She served as Clinton's transition director in 1992 and as her [[chief of staff]] during her first term as [[First Lady of the United States]] (1993–1997), the first African American woman to hold that position and the first Chief of Staff to the First Lady who also served as an Assistant to the President. 

As stated in [[Taylor Branch]]'s [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVGD72FBaBsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;retailer_id=powells_prod The Clinton Tapes], in 1994, President Clinton turned to Williams "to compile confidential suggestions" on personnel shifts ... According to Branch, "When I asked how unusual it was for the first lady's office to be involved, he replied there was no easy blueprint for reorganizing the organizers. Williams was shrewd, discreet, and efficient."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Branch|first=Taylor|title=The Clinton tapes : wrestling history with the president|year=2009|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-1-4165-4333-6|pages=160–161|edition=1st Simon &amp; Schuster hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a profile in [[Essence Magazine]] Ana Perez, who during George Bush's administration was the first Black person to serve as a press secretary to a First Lady said of Williams: "I am in awe of her...I have so much respect for her because she has this absolutely calm center and because she is a good and decent person. She's a do-gooder in every sense of the word."&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa J. Gallman, Women Who Make A Difference; Maggie Williams, ''Essence'' (October 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; She has been described as having "very good judgment on issues and people" by Leon Panetta.&lt;ref&gt;"Pal Runs to Clinton's Rescue", ''McClatchy'', February 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vince Foster scandal==
On the night of the death of deputy White House counsel [[Vince Foster]] in 1993, a Secret Service agent claimed he saw Williams remove two handfuls of folders from his office, which she vehemently denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelgraham.com/hillarys-bag-man-er-person-takes-the-helm-at-the-iop|title=News Radio 106.7 - The Michael Graham Show|publisher=Michaelgraham.com|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MardiGrass''' is a [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] [[Legality of cannabis|law reform]] rally and festival held annually in the town of [[Nimbin, New South Wales|Nimbin]], in north east [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

[[File:MardiGrass1.jpg|thumb|275px|right|2008 Cannabis Law Reform Rally, Mardigrass, Nimbin]]

==History==
In March 1993, after a decade of raids and arrests, and a particularly intensive recent period of random street searches, arrests and rough treatment, a spontaneous demonstration erupted, and marched to the police station, pelting it with eggs and toilet paper. Negative newspaper reports followed. Nimbin Hemp Embassy (formerly "Nimbin Hemp") members decided to hold a peaceful protest in a non-confrontational atmosphere, that ordinary people could comfortably attend, on 1 May 1993. That was the first MardiGrass. (The spelling is that officially used by the MardiGrass Organising Body) The MardiGrass Organising Body (MOB) was formed to manage the event and consists entirely of volunteers. The intention is to hold a MardiGrass every year until prohibition ends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimbinmardigrass.com/history.html NimbinMardiGrass.com History] (Retrieved 27 December 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== The first MardiGrass - 1993==
[[File:Mardigrass.JPG|thumb|350px|left|Nimbin Mardigrass 2008]]
In March 1993 &lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.nimbinmardigrass.com/history.html] Nimbin MardiGrass  ''Nimbin MardiGrass History 1996'' (Retrieved 7 May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; the Nimbin police station had already been laid siege. Undercover police officers had been discovered buying cannabis in the area. This enraged a small portion of the townsfolk to such an extent that they chased the police officers back to the police station and pelted them with eggs. Concerned about bad publicity some of the townsfolk decided to come up with a more peaceful form of protest that ordinary people could comfortably join. Bob Hopkins (a.k.a. [[The Plantem]]) was the man who came up with the idea of MardiGrass.

On 1 May 1993 &lt;ref name="history" /&gt; people gathered by the local creek for the rally. They also had a good time with their colourful bright clothing coloured with dye of food colouring. Bob, dressed as a [[nun]] led the people while blowing  on a [[tuba]]. There was only a small group at the start (along with a giant joint made of a large sheet and other assorted household goods).

The big joint acted as a giant magnet for the townsfolk. By the time they reached the police station they were, by most accounts, over a thousand strong.

Shortly after, backup arrived, but not before the media who began to broadcast images of the event to the country and world. The cops found themselves in the unenviable situation of not being able to act against the townsfolk. They were unable to use aggressive force against them on camera, and as such watched on as the protesters marched forward.

In the evening of this historic event, Bob Hopkins channelled the spirit of the Plantem for the first time and he and his friends,after adopting Winston Churhills V is for victory sign,vowed to hold MardiGrass annually until the war on [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] was over.

==Description==
The protest rally and parade is held on the first weekend in May, and is the core element of MardiGrass; the centre of a festival weekend containing events such as the Hemp Olympix, including [[Joint (cannabis)|Joint]] Rolling, [[Bong]] Throw and Yell and Growers Iron-person events; also including the Nimbin Cannabis Cup, Harvest Ball, Picker's Ball, live music and dance parties. The "Protest Rally and Parade" is held on the Sunday, gathers opposite the Police station and then marches away, through the village to Peace Park, accompanied by the traditional "Big Joint" and dancing Ganja Faeries. MardiGrass is a participant in the [[Global Marijuana March]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimbinmardigrass.com/2006/program06.html NimbinMardiGrass.com 2006 MardiGrass Program] (Retrieved 27 December 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miss Universe 2016''' was the 65th [[Miss Universe]] pageant, was held on 30 January 2017{{efn|name=Philippine date}} at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]], [[Pasay City]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]. [[Pia Wurtzbach]] of the [[Philippines]] crowned [[Iris Mittenaere]] of [[France]] as her successor at the end of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/miss-universe-2016-winner-live-photos-714027|title=Miss Universe 2016 winner is Miss France Iris Mittenaere|first=Ankita|last=Mehta|publisher=ibtimes|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/01/29/miss-france-iris-mittenaere-crowned-miss-universe-2017/97226100/|title=Miss France Iris Mittenaere is crowned Miss Universe 2017|date=30 January 2017|publisher=USA Today|last=McDermott|first=Maeve}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the second time in the history of the competition that the pageant skipped the entire year, following the [[Miss Universe 2014|2014 pageant]] which was held in January 2015. 

France's victory ended the country's 63-year title drought, the longest in Miss Universe history.  Mittenaere was the first European Miss Universe to serve a full term in 26 years, the last being Norway's [[Mona Grudt]] who was [[Miss Universe 1990]], and the first European to win the title outright since [[Oxana Fedorova]] who became [[Miss Universe 2002]] before being dethroned four months later.

==Organization==
===Negotiations===
The agreement to host the pageant in the Philippines was signed on November 16, 2016.  This agreement, made between the Miss Universe Organization, the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Philippine Department of Tourism]] (DOT) and the LCS Group of Companies, was the result of negotiations that began about four months earlier.&lt;ref name=final/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABSlook"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/11/16/16/look-contract-signed-for-miss-universe-2016-in-philippines|title=LOOK: Contract signed for Miss Universe 2016 in Philippines|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=November 16, 2016|accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:President Rodrigo R. Duterte meets with Miss Universe 2015 Pia Wurtzbach.jpg|thumb|left|Miss Universe 2015 [[Pia Wurtzbach]] on a courtesy call with [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Rodrigo Duterte]].]]
Discussions began on July 18, 2016, when Miss Universe 2015 [[Pia Wurtzbach]] met with Philippine President [[Rodrigo Duterte]].  Although Duterte was open to the idea of having the pageant hosted by the Philippines, he did not want the government to pay the expense of doing so (but a government spokesperson later said that some "services" would be provided for the event).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vila|first1=Alixandra Caole|title=Philippines to host Miss Universe coronation night in 2017|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2016/07/28/1607565/philippines-host-miss-universe-coronation-night-2017|accessdate=July 29, 2016|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnphiltohost"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Montano|first1=Isabella|title=Philippines to host Miss Universe 2016|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/lifestyle/2016/07/28/Miss-Universe-2016-Philippines.html|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=CNN Philippines|date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About two weeks after the meeting, the Department of Tourism announced that the Philippines would be the host.  A spokesperson for the Department said that, according to Miss Universe Organization president Paula Shugart, the Philippines was the organization's prime choice for hosting the pageant, although other countries were being considered.&lt;ref name="cnnphiltohost"/&gt;

Despite the statement made by the Department of Tourism, the final decision to hold the pageant in the Philippines had not yet been made and, over the next few months, the Miss Universe Organization had changed its mind several times on the matter.  Initial reports did not disclose the reasons for the breakdowns in negotiations, but a later report linked the Organization's concerns with Duterte's controversial remarks regarding U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], as well as his plans to separate ties between the Philippines and the United States.  These statements were not received well by the [[William Morris Endeavor|William Morris Entertainment/International Marketing Group]] (WME), the owners of the Miss Universe franchise. Duterte's statement that he would be glad to kill as many drug addicts as [[Adolf Hitler]] killed Jews during the [[Holocaust]] led to WME executive Ziv Emanuel (brother of [[Rahm Emanuel]]) to cancel the talks.  [[Ilocos Sur]] governor [[Chavit Singson]], who was also chairman of the LCS Group, sent representatives, including some Jewish friends, to the United States to persuade Emanuel to maintain his interest in a Philippines-hosted event. Duterte's later apology for his Holocaust-related remark helped in the renegotiation.  Also helpful was Singson's offer to add women-empowerment programs to the pageant.&lt;ref name="reallyhappen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Enriquez|first1=Marge|title=Chavit Singson: What really happened behind the scenes of Miss U|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/246331/chavit-singson-really-happened-behind-scenes-miss-u/|accessdate=December 6, 2016|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flores|first1=Karen|title=Did you know?

The Miss Universe Organization's final decision came on November 3, 2016, when Wurtzbach announced via a video message that the Philippines would be the host.&lt;ref name=final&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/11/03/16/final-date-venue-of-next-miss-universe-pageant-announced|title=Final date, venue of next Miss Universe pageant announced|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=November 3, 2016|accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="officialpdi"&gt;{{cite news|title=It's official: Miss Universe in PH will push through—DOT |url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/242701/its-official-miss-universe-in-ph-will-push-through-dot/ |accessdate=November 3, 2016 |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership agreement was signed on November 16 and, on that same day, the pageant's official website and [[Facebook]] page were launched.&lt;ref name=final/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABSlook" /&gt;

In September 2016, the [[Mall of Asia Arena]] in [[Pasay]] was announced to be the main coronation venue of the pageant according to the [[Secretary of Tourism (Philippines)|Philippine Tourism Secretary]] [[Wanda Corazon Teo]].&lt;ref name="doesn't"&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte doesn't like Steve Harvey to host Miss Universe|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/09/01/16/duterte-doesnt-like-steve-harvey-to-host-miss-universe|accessdate=September 1, 2016|publisher=ABS-CBN News|date=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippine Arena]] in [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]] and [[Bocaue, Bulacan]] was the other venue considered by the Department of Tourism as the main coronation venue of the pageant, but the Miss Universe Organization disapproved of the venue due to "security reasons".&lt;ref name=mu&gt;{{cite news|title=Chavit Singson secures major sponsors for Miss Universe 2016|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/214-who-s-who/144529-chavit-singson-sponsors-miss-universe-2017|accessdate=September 1, 2016|publisher=[[Rappler]]|date=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eyes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Requintina|first1=Robert|title=PH eyes MOA or Philippine Arena as venue for Miss Universe 2016|url=http://tempo.com.ph/2016/08/02/ph-eyes-moa-or-philippine-arena-as-venue-for-miss-universe-2016/|publisher=Tempo|accessdate=August 2, 2016|language=English, Filipino|date=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other aspects===
The funds needed to stage the pageant in the country came entirely from private businesses. Among the reported sponsors were [[Philippine Airlines]], the [[SM Group]], [[Solar Entertainment]], Filipino billionaire [[Henry Sy]] and Japanese billionaire [[Kazuo Okada]]. The [[Okada Manila]] would serve as the residential venue for the Miss Universe 2016 candidates. The projected expense for the event was US$11 million.&lt;ref name=mu/&gt;&lt;ref name="confirmed"&gt;{{cite news|title=DOT confirms PHL hosting of Miss Universe 2016|url=http://www.lcsgroup.com.ph/dot-confirms-phl-hosting-of-miss-universe-2016.html|accessdate=November 28, 2016|publisher=LCS Group of Companies: Official Sponsor of 65th Miss Universe| date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The candidates were expected to arrive on January 13, 2017.

===Ancillary and other events===
Alongside with the main pageant, ancillary events were held which has no effect on the contestants' total pageant score. The contestants were scheduled to participate in fashion shows in Davao, Cebu, and Vigan. Each venue had a theme; Mindanao fabric for Davao, beachwear for Cebu, and ''[[Maria Clara terno|terno]]'' for Vigan. The contestants partook in a different event in Bicol.&lt;ref name="tovisit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tantungco|first1=Vernise|title=Miss Universe candidates to visit these PH sites|url=http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/specials/miss-universe/152948-miss-universe-2016-philippines-visit-sites|accessdate=November 21, 2016|work=Rappler|date=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2016, some of the pageant's candidates had a photoshoot with [[whale shark]]s in [[Oslob, Cebu]]. This activity was criticized by [[Greenpeace Southeast Asia]], Marine Wildlife Watch, and other wildlife conservationist groups in the Philippines who discourage human interaction with the whale sharks, as they are considered [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Universe criticized for whale shark swim in Cebu|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/12/13/16/miss-universe-criticized-for-whale-shark-swim-in-cebu|accessdate=December 14, 2016|work=ABS-CBN News|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Tourism (DOT) said that there were only five candidates present and the activity was an occular inspection. Following criticisms, the DOT is considering to do the whale watching activity for the final show in [[Donsol]], [[Sorsogon]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Angeles|first1=Peach|title=Miss Universe 2016: Why Whale Shark Watching In Oslob May Be Excluded In Final Show|url=http://www.ibtimes.ph/miss-universe-2016-whale-shark-watching-oslob-cebu-5316|accessdate=December 14, 2016|work=International Business Times|date=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 14, 2016, the DOT cancelled the fashion show originally scheduled on January 19, 2017 at the [[SMX Convention Center Davao|SMX Convention Center]] in Davao City to prevent further "controversy" following the claim of local-based designers led by the Davao Fashion and Design Council Foundation, Inc. (DFDCFI) that they have been "brushed off" by the pageant organizers. The group claimed that they were never consulted and questioned why they were asked to dress up local models instead of being in charge of pre-show cocktail of the main event which is tasked to non-Mindanaoan designer, Renee Salud. Following the cancellation announcement, the DFDCFI said that they respect the decision but urged the organizers that Davao City to remain as one of the places to be visited by the candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boga|first1=Jesse Pizarro|title=DOT cancels Miss Universe fashion show in Davao due to ‘controversy’|url=http://www.mindanews.com/top-stories/2016/12/dot-cancels-miss-universe-fashion-show-in-davao-due-to-controversy/|accessdate=December 14, 2016|work=MindaNews|publisher=Mindanao News and Information Center Service Cooperative|date=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, 2016, it was announced that the fashion show will push through after Salud and the DFDCFI cleared their misunderstandings and decided to help each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/video/life/12/22/16/miss-universe-2016-pageant-mapapanood-sa-abs-cbn|title=Miss Universe 2016 pageant, mapapanood sa ABS-CBN|access-date=December 27, 2016|work=[[ABS-CBNnews.com]]|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]]|date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American presenter [[Steve Harvey]] has a five year contract with the Miss Universe Organization for hosting the Miss Universe pageant. Philippine President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] expressed hesitation on Harvey hosting the event due to Harvey announcing the wrong winner at the [[Miss Universe 2015]] pageant.

[[File:Hawkwind Donington 1982.jpg|thumb|[[Hawkwind]] playing Donington in 1982]]
'''Monsters of Rock''' was an annual hard rock and heavy metal music festival held in [[Castle Donington]], [[England]] from 1980 to 1996, taking place every year except 1989 and 1993. It later branched into other locations such as the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Sweden]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], the [[United States]] and the former [[Soviet Union]].

==History==
In 1980, promoter Paul Loasby, along with Maurice Jones, planned a one-day festival dedicated specifically for bands within the [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genre. Loasby was an established and successful promoter working that year on the [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] UK tour and penned the festival as the final show of the tour for the band to headline. Jones knew the owner of the [[Donington Park]] race track, Tom Wheatcroft, located next to the village of [[Castle Donington]] in [[Leicestershire]], England, and the site was chosen to host the event.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nme.com/news/download-festival/51483&lt;/ref&gt;

Donington Park was unknown as a major location but its location in the [[East Midlands]] next to the [[M1 motorway|M1]], A42 and A50 allowed for better transportation to the site from around the country. Additionally the site ground level sloped which allowed for a better viewing for the audience throughout the site.

The first Monsters of Rock line-up consisted of a mix of British and international bands and was a success with 35,000 heavy metal fans attending. Although only conceived as a one off event, it was mentioned on the day the idea that the festival will return the following year and the first edition birthed what would become a regular festival for the next 15 years, becoming synonymous as a Mecca for fans of the genre and further establishing the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] as the home of heavy metal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualfestivals.com/index.cfm?section=latest.features&amp;id=2654&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the attendance continued to grow, reaching 107,000 in 1988, when two fans died during [[Guns N' Roses]] set. Initially the blame was thought to be the size of the crowd and a rush forward during the band's set but officially the cause is laid on the weather, causing muddy and wet conditions on the sloping ground. As a result, the festival did not take place in 1989, but returned the year after with a limitation to the crowd of 75,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualfestivals.com/index.cfm?section=latest.features&amp;id=2654&amp;page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival had been held in parallel in West Germany from 1983 to 1991. In 1984 and 1986 the festival branched into Sweden. In 1988, the festival occurred for the first time in France, Italy, Spain and The Netherlands. It was held as a one-time event in 1991 in Soviet Union, Poland, Belgium, Hungary. In 1994, the festival was exported overseas to Chile, Argentina and Brazil.

In 1993 the MONSTERS OF ROCK® radio show debuted in the [[United States]] with host Harlan Hendrickson. Guests on the show include everyone from [[AC/DC]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[Van Halen]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Motörhead]], [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Ratt]], [[Dio band|Dio]], [[Y&amp;T]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Slayer]] and [[Poison (American band)|Poison]].

The Monsters of Rock festival continued on as the premier hard rock and heavy metal event in Great Britain in the 1990s but started to fall upon hard times as heavy metal became less popular, with another cancellation in 1993 due to being unable to find a strong enough headliner. In 1995 the festival found itself in a similar situation until [[Metallica]] agreed to play with the condition of the band having control over the event and naming it "Escape from the Studio". In 1996 [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] co-headlined the festival and although there were plans to extend the festival into a two-day event in 1997, the promoters once again found themselves in a struggle for headliners and the event was cancelled and discontinued.

Donington Park remained event-less until 2001 when the Rock and Blues Festival and [[Stereophonics]] held events at the site. In 2002 the [[Ozzfest]] tour returned to the UK using Donington Park as their only British event and the following year [[Live Nation]] picked up the reins as Monsters of Rock's successor in the name of [[Download Festival]]. An outstanding success from the offset, the festival continues to this day having increased to a three-day event with five stages, though as of 2008 the event has been relegated outside of the track.

In 2006, the Monsters of Rock name was revived and held at the [[National Bowl]] in [[Milton Keynes]], England, for a one off event headlined by [[Deep Purple]] and with [[Alice Cooper]] as a special guest.

In 2012 Harlan Hendrickson &amp; Monsters of Rock Worldwide partnered with Larry Morand and Mike London to launch the inaugural Monsters Of Rock Cruise.

To date, the only band that have headlined the festival more than twice is [[AC/DC]], with four occasions: 1981, 1984, 1991 and 2010 (Download Festival).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22461">Starting in 1996, American [[jam band]] [[Phish]] has hosted a series of [[music festival|festivals]] - ten in total, with attendance ranging from 35,000 to 85,000. They are typically the only band to perform at the festivals, although the 1997 Lemonwheel festival and 1999 Camp Oswego festival both featured a second stage for supporting acts.

''The Clifford Ball'' was the first weekend-long festival hosted by Phish throughout their career.  The event took place on August 16 and 17, 1996, on the site of a former [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] base in [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]], [[New York (state)|New York]], about one hour west from Phish's home base of [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], [[Vermont]]. The event was named after [[Clifford Ball (aviation)|Clifford Ball]], a man who held events for aviators such as [[Amelia Earhart]]. ''The Clifford Ball'' was a proposed name for the 1990s traveling festival that ultimately was named [[H.O.R.D.E.]].

The name Clifford Ball had been known to the band for some five years before ''The Clifford Ball'' took place.  According to Phish Manager, John Paluska, "The band was walking through the airport in [[Pittsburgh]] one day, and they came upon a small, little plaque of a guy named Clifford Ball... it said 'Clifford Ball: a beacon of light in the world of flight.' ...they just thought the [expression] was the funniest idea for a show..."&lt;ref name="PHISH: The Clifford Ball"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2b1DHeGsI, PHISH: The Clifford Ball, an MTV Special.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event combined overhead flights by [[bomber]]s, [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]s, [[glider (sailplane)|glider]]s, and various other aerial vehicles with carnival rides, [[juggling|jugglers]], and men on [[stilts]].  Three gigantic video screens and four sound towers were erected to amplify the band.  Phish, the marquee band who headlined the event, were joined by a classical violin quartet, a blues quartet, a choral quintet, and guitar soloists.  The "Clifford Ball Orchestra" performed an afternoon set of pieces by [[Debussy]], [[Ravel]], and [[Stravinsky]]. Phish performed seven sets of music over the two nights, including a late night set on a flatbed truck that rolled through the parking lot in the wee hours of the morning.&lt;ref name="phish.net"&gt;http://www.phish.net/faq/clifford.html&lt;/ref&gt;

70,000 people attended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =  Small Adirondack Town Is Host of a Giant Concert | newspaper = The New York Times | date = August 18, 1996 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E1D61630F93BA2575BC0A960958260 | accessdate = 2007-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; making the event Phish's largest concert up to that point and the largest rock concert in the [[United States]] in that year. The audience was four times the size of surrounding city of Plattsburgh, making Plattsburgh the ninth most-populous city in New York that weekend,&lt;ref name="phish.net"/&gt; and adding $20 million into the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Weiss   | first = Lois | title = Concert shows potential for military bases - Plattsburgh Airbase, New York | publisher = Real Estate Weekly | date = September 4, 1996 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_n5_v43/ai_18729598 | accessdate = 2007-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the size of the concert, it received very little coverage from the mainstream media. [[MTV]] aired a documentary of the experience, using footage from Phish's production company, Dionysian Productions. Phish released [[The Clifford Ball (DVD)|a seven-DVD box set]] on March 3, 2009, chronicling the band's seven sets and including bonus documentary footage.

==The Great Went==
[[Image:Phishwent.gif|right|thumb]]
''The Great Went'' was the sequel to ''The Clifford Ball'', taking place on August 16 and 17, 1997, close to the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]] at the [[Loring Air Force Base]] in [[Limestone, Maine|Limestone]], [[Maine]]. The event was named after a quote from the movie ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]''.

The world's largest fire truck hosed down thousands of fans as they arrived Saturday morning, and on Sunday morning, approximately 1,100 people posed nude as part of a fifty-state tour by photographer [[Spencer Tunick]].  Throughout the weekend, the members of the audience each painted their own individual piece of art. The resultant pieces of fan artwork were attached to one another to create a tower that was eventually several stories high. The band also created their own piece of art during a jam on the final night. Later that evening, the band passed their artwork through the audience. To create a connection between audience and band, the band's artwork was attached to the fan artwork. As seen in ''[[Bittersweet Motel]]'', a giant matchstick was lit, burning the tower to the ground.

Phish was the only band that played the main stage, performing seven sets of music over two nights, including a late night [[disco]] set at 2:30 AM featuring all four members on keyboards.  The [[Bangor Symphony Orchestra]] performed Debussy and Stravinsky during the afternoon of the second day, accompanied by a glider pilot who soared above the audience. 

75,000 people attended, making the event Phish's largest concert up to that point, and the top-grossing rock concert in the [[United States]] in the summer of 1997. Fans camped out onsite in tents, making Limestone the largest city in Maine over the weekend.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phish.net/faq/greatwent.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lemonwheel==
[[Image:Lemonwheel .jpg|right|thumb|300px|Lemonwheel]]
''Lemonwheel'' was the third festival hosted by the band, taking place on August 15 and 16, 1998, again at [[Loring Air Force Base]] in Limestone, Maine.  60,000 people attended&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godstreetwine.com/mailinglist/finewine/archive/finewine/finewine.log9809a.txt |title=Phish Fest Nets $81,000 In Drugs; 1,200 Arrests |work=SonicNet News |publisher=sonicnet.com |accessdate=2008-06-13 |date=1998-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430045613/http://www.godstreetwine.com/mailinglist/finewine/archive/finewine/finewine.log9809a.txt |archivedate=April 30, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a community of fans that, again, made Limestone one of the largest cities in Maine over the weekend.

Phish was the only band to play the main stage, performing seven sets of music over two nights.  Several other bands, including [[Keller Williams]] and [[Manic Mule]], played in the sidestage. The concert grounds, shaped like a large figure 8, contained several beer gardens, a Ferris wheel, an elephant, jugglers, and stiltsmen.  At the festival, the audience made candles throughout the weekend. Saturday night's fourth set included an hour-long [[Ambient music|ambient]] jam on a dark stage covered in hundreds of homemade candles.  On Sunday, the night ended with the band lighting fuses onstage, burning a path through the stage and activating a large elephant that sprayed a gusher of water into the air from its trunk, and then slowly made its way through the audience to the tune of "Baby Elephant Walk"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phish.net/faq/lemonwheel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Camp Oswego==
''Camp Oswego'' was a two-night run hosted by the jamband Phish. The event took place on July 17 and 18, [[1999 in music|1999]], at the Oswego County Airport in [[Volney, New York|Volney]], [[New York (state)|New York]], a small rural upstate town. 65,000 people attended. This event, though part of 1999's normal summer tour, is officially considered and was promoted as the band's fourth festival, despite the previously announced festival in Big Cypress, Florida on December 30–31, 1999 and January 1, 2000.

Phish was the only headlining band at the event, performing five sets of music over two nights. Second stage bands included the [[Del McCoury|Del McCoury Band]], [[The Slip (band)|The Slip]] and [[Ozomatli]], among others. Fans camped out onsite in tents, creating a community of fans that became one of the largest cities in [[New York (state)|New York]] over the weekend{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

Band and audience attempted to break the world record for the largest number of people doing the same dance at one time during the song "Meatstick," but the record was not broken (representatives from the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' were on hand).

The following weekend, across the state, [[Woodstock 1999]] was making new headlines as a few hundred people, out of the 200,000 people in attendance, rioted and burned the concert grounds. A rumor suggested that New York Governor [[George Pataki]] had made mention of the peacefulness of the Phish show as compared to the debacle at Woodstock, but no source has emerged for the oft-repeated quote, and it is now considered to be apocryphal.

==Big Cypress==
[[File:Phish NY2k mascot.jpg|thumb|left|Concert's alligator mascot and a cutout of the band which was featured in the concert's entertainment village]]
''Big Cypress'' was the fifth and largest of eleven weekend-long festivals hosted by the rock band [[Phish]]. The event took place on the eve of the millennium – December 30 and 31, [[1999 in music|1999]], at the [[Big Cypress Indian Reservation]] near the [[Big Cypress National Preserve]] in southern [[Florida]]. 85,000 people attended, making it the largest Millennium Eve concert on earth that night, surpassing shows by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[The Eagles]], [[Eminem]], [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Metallica]], the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], and [[Elton John]].

In a [[2000 in music|2000]] cover story for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', three of the four Phish members declared Big Cypress to be the greatest Phish concert ever. It was also voted as the most popular Phish show ever by fans in the final volume of ''[[The Pharmer's Almanac]]''. It was also the longest Phish concert ever, culminating in a seven-and-a-half-hour second set from midnight on [[New Year's Eve]] to sunrise [[New Year's Day]]. Phish was the only band at the event, performing five sets of music (nearly sixteen hours) over two nights. As fans left the concert area at sunrise, [[The Beatles]]' "[[Here Comes the Sun]]" played over the PA speakers.

[[Peter Jennings]] reported on the huge audience in an episode of ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]''. The band's performance of "[[Heavy Things]]" was [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] during [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[ABC 2000 Today|millennium coverage]]. Following the song, at the band's request, fans chanted the word "cheesecake" instead of cheering to confuse viewers at home (although in the end, the broadcast cut away before the gag could play out). The ABC broadcast was also shown to billions around the world as part of ''[[2000 Today]]''. At the beginning of the band's seven-and-a-half-hour second set, guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]] mentioned that the band had portable toilets onstage so they could use the restroom during the marathon set, and a team of security guards lined the stage to prevent band members from "wimping out" and trying to leave the stage. In a later interview with [[Charlie Rose]], Anastasio stated that this was the peak of Phish's career.

==It==
''It'' was the sixth festival hosted by the rock band [[Phish]]. The event took place on August 2 and 3, 2003, at the [[Loring Air Force Base]] in [[Limestone, Maine|Limestone]], [[Maine]], just miles from the Canada–U.S. border. 60,000 people attended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phisharchive.com/articles/2003/billit.html|title=Phish Festival Falls Short, but Still 'It'|work=Phish Archive|publisher=Reuters/Billboard|accessdate=2008-06-13|date=2003-08-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203135311/http://www.phisharchive.com/articles/2003/billit.html|archivedate=2008-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in one of the largest Phish concerts ever.  This was also their most-played festival venue (see also the Great Went and Lemonwheel). [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] was on hand to make a documentary of the experience.

Phish was the only band at the event, performing seven sets of music over two nights, including a late night ambient set on top of the air traffic control tower at 2:30 AM after the first night's concert. Fans camped onsite in tents, creating a community of Phans that became one of the largest cities in Maine over the weekend.

==Coventry==
''Coventry'' was the seventh weekend-long festival hosted by the rock band [[Phish]], and was announced to be the final performances ever, by the band. The event took place from August 13–15, [[2004 in music|2004]], at a farm in the small town of [[Coventry, Vermont|Coventry]], [[Vermont]]. An estimated 65,000-68,000 attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Throngs Of Phish Heads Walk Into Festival Site |author=Gary E.

Phish was the only band at the event, performing six sets of music over two nights that were the band's final live performances, until their 2009 reunion. Fans camped on site in tents, creating a community that became the largest city in Vermont over the weekend.

110,000 people were expected to attend. It was simulcast to thousands more in movie theaters across the United States. The event was also simulcast on [[XM Satellite Radio]]. Unfortunately, a week of rain had flooded the concert field to the point where people were turned away, causing gridlock on the highway and roads leading to the site. Rumors circulated that the stage was sinking. The band had made use of a local radio station turning it into "The Bunny" radio with live reports. These reports requested patience from concert goers.  However, when Phish Bassist Mike Gordon came on the radio, he announced that the field and venue were in a state of disaster and that no more vehicles would be allowed into the venue. Rumor spread up and down the traffic lines that Phish would play another concert, since less than 20,000 fans had made it into the venue.

Instead of turning away and despite warnings from the National Guard, tens of thousands parked their cars on highway medians, in breakdown lanes, and on the sides of roads. Then they hiked in to the concert venue, some walking as far as 30 miles to the venue {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.  Local residents stepped in and began shuttling fans in and out of the site and to their vehicles.  Despite efforts by attendees, trash accumulated from fans stuck along the road.  The bill for the subsequent cleanup was sent from the State of Vermont to the Phish organization who picked up the bill in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cleaning up after Phish fans cost $35,000 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The Boston Globe |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=August 23, 2004 |accessdate={{date|2010-02-16}} |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/vermont/articles/2004/08/23/cleaning_up_after_phish_fans_cost_35000/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040825024247/http://www.boston.com/news/local/vermont/articles/2004/08/23/cleaning_up_after_phish_fans_cost_35000/ |archivedate=August 25, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concert included some songs written at Coventry to glorify members of the team (Bruno and Dicky Scotland). The band gave away their trampolines during "You Enjoy Myself".  They broke down crying onstage several times, most notably when [[Page McConnell]] choked up during the ballad "Wading in the Velvet Sea." Unable to continue singing, he turned the microphone to the audience, who took over in chorus.

==Festival 8==

On June 26, 2009, the band announced a "[[save the date]]" for a three-day festival on October 30 - November 1.  Phish.com contained an animated map of the United States, and individual states were slowly removed from the map, leaving [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phish.com/savethedate/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710002448/http://phish.com/savethedate/ |archivedate=2009-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Confirming several rumors, the band announced that "Festival 8" would take place at the Empire Polo Fields in [[Indio, California|Indio]], California.  The band played eight sets over the three nights, including a [[Phish and their musical costumes|musical costume]] on Halloween, [[The Rolling Stones|The Rolling Stones']] "[[Exile On Main Street]]" and an all acoustic set "at the crack of noon" the following day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phish.com/news/index.php?year=2009#story445&lt;/ref&gt; Before the acoustic set, the crowd was served free coffee and figure-8-shaped donuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://jamtopia.com/blog/phish-to-play-acoustic-set-at-festival-8-coffee-and-donuts./ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027184330/http://jamtopia.com/blog/phish-to-play-acoustic-set-at-festival-8-coffee-and-donuts./ |archive-date=2015-10-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was filmed in HD 3D and portions of the festival were released in movie theaters across the United States as "[[Phish 3D]]." Members of the band [[Sharon Jones &amp; The Dap-Kings]] joined the band on Halloween night to perform a number of songs.

Attendance figures for Festival 8 were estimated at 40,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/phish-follow-halloween-show-with-first-ever-acoustic-set-at-fest-8-20091102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Super Ball IX==

Super Ball IX took place at the [[Watkins Glen International]] in [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins Glen]], New York on July 1–3, 2011. It was the first concert to take place at Watkins Glen International since [[Summer Jam at Watkins Glen]] in 1973. Seven official sets were played throughout the weekend on the festival's main stage. In addition to the official sets, one additional set featuring ambient, avant-garde music similar to the IT Festival Tower Jam was performed. The set was played late Saturday evening from a partially hidden stage contained in a self-storage building that had been constructed as a piece of the festival's various art installations.

Attendance figures for the festival were estimated at 30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/arts/music/phish-gives-its-fans-a-festival-in-watkins-glen-ny.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Local officials were pleased at how smoothly the festival went and deemed the event a success.&lt;ref&gt;http://centralny.ynn.com/content/top_stories/548919/officials-deem-phish-festival-a-success/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnaball==

On March 18, 2015, Phish announced their tenth festival named Magnaball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://phish.com/magnaball/|url=http://phish.com/magnaball/|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was once again held at Watkins Glen International in Watkins Glen, NY, and took place August 21–23, 2015. Seven official sets of music were played over three nights. An additional set was played late Saturday night behind a large drive-in movie screen installed on the back of the race track's bleachers. This set featured ambient music and projections on the screen with live videos of the band superimposed.

The festival sold out, with attendance figures estimated at over 40,000 people. A live video stream of all three nights was offered for purchase on [http://www.livephish.com Livephish.com].

==Curveball (canceled)==

On February 26, 2018, Phish announced their eleventh festival named Curveball. The festival was supposed to be held at Watkins Glen International in Watkins Glen, New York, and take place August 17-19, 2018. However, the festival was canceled on August 16 by the direct order of the New York State Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phish festival Curveball at Watkins Glen canceled over health concerns |url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2018/08/16/phish-festival-curveball-watkins-glen-canceled-over-health-concerns/1013358002/ |website=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle |accessdate=1 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Torrential downpours and flooding throughout the [[Finger Lakes]] region of upstate New York led the health department to cancel the festival in order to protect the health and safety of concert goers. A mandatory requirement to boil all water was put in place during the week before and on Thursday, August 16, the water was still deemed too unsafe to drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2018/2018-08-16_emergency_cancelation_curveball_festival.htm|title=Joint Statement from New York State Department of Health and Schuyler County Regarding State of Emergency and This Weekend’s Curveball Festival|website=www.health.ny.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the cancelation, Curveball ticketholders were given both a full refund and free livestreams of all three nights of Phish's annual run at [[Dick's Sporting Goods Park]] in [[Commerce City, Colorado]], which was held two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Update for Curveball Ticket Holders |url=http://phish.com/news/an-update-for-curveball-ticket-holders/ |website=Phish |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R (Pinochet Ugarte) v Bow St Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate''''' [2000] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/41.html 1 AC 61], 119 and [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/17.html 147] is a set of three [[UK constitutional law]] judgments by the [[House of Lords]], on whether former Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] could claim [[state immunity]] from torture allegations made by a Spanish court and therefore evade extradition to [[Spain]]. It affected international criminal law and human rights law.&lt;ref&gt;Byers, Michael, The Law and Politics of the Pinochet Case, 10 Duke J. of Comp. &amp; Int'l L. p 416&lt;/ref&gt;

The first judgment enabled Pinochet to be deported.&lt;ref&gt;[2000] 1 AC 61&lt;/ref&gt; But this was controversially set aside in the second judgment, ''R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No 2)'' (''Pinochet&amp;nbsp;II'') because [[Lord Hoffmann]], as a director of [[Amnesty International]], was accepted to have had the possibility of bias.&lt;ref&gt;[2000] 1 AC 119. {{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/255976.stm |title= UK Politics Pinochet judge under pressure |publisher= [[BBC News]] |date=1999-01-15 |accessdate=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a third case ''R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, Ex Parte Pinochet Ugarte (No 3)'' (''Pinochet&amp;nbsp;III''), which confirmed that Pinochet was not entitled to state immunity but that acts committed outside of British territories could only be prosecuted under national law if committed after the passing of section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[2000] 1 AC 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Pinochet was accused by a Spanish judge of torture, a crime under international law which can be prosecuted in any country under the  doctrine of [[universal jurisdiction]]. The Spanish judge faxed an INTERPOL arrest warrant to London and Pinochet was arrested later that evening. Pinochet's lawyers argued that as Pinochet was head of state at the time of the alleged crimes he was immune from the jurisdiction of British courts. The Divisional Court ruled Pinochet had state immunity.

==Judgment==
===Pinochet (No 1)===
By a 3–2 majority, Lord Nicholls, [[Lord Hoffmann]] and Lord Steyn the [[House of Lords]] ruled that Pinochet did not have state immunity. 

A key passage of the judgment reads:

{{Cquote|... the development of international law since the Second World War justifies the conclusion that by the time of the 1973 coup d’état, and certainly ever since, international law condemned genocide, torture, hostage taking and crimes against humanity (during an armed conflict or in peace time) as international crimes deserving of punishment.  Given this state of international law, it seems to me difficult to maintain that the commission of such high crimes may amount to acts performed in the exercise of the functions of a Head of State.}}

Lord Slynn and Lord Lloyd dissented.

===Pinochet (No 2)===
''R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No 2)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldjudgmt/jd990115/pino01.htm ''In re Pinochet'', Oral Judgment: 17 December 1998, Oral Judgment: 17 December 1998] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523035125/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldjudgmt/jd990115/pino01.htm |date=23 May 2012 }}, [1999] [[UKHL]] 52&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[English law|English]] legal case which involved the unprecedented setting aside of a [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] judgment based upon the possibility of [[bias]]. [[Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann|Lord Hoffmann]]'s failure to declare links to [[Amnesty International]] meant that a previous House of Lords judgment on the [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity]] of former [[Chile]]an dictator General [[Augusto Pinochet]] had to be set aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/235456.stm |title= A look at Lord Hoffmann |date=1998-12-17 |publisher= [[BBC News]] |accessdate=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pinochet (No 3)===
''R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, Ex Parte Pinochet Ugarte (No 3)'' was a [[House of Lords]] judgment on the state immunity of [[Chile]]an President [[Augusto Pinochet]]. The judgment was necessary after the House of Lords ruling ''[[R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte|R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, Ex Parte Pinochet Ugarte]]'' was [[R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2)|set aside]] when one of the judges in the case failed to disclose links to a human rights organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://swarb.co.uk/regina-v-bow-street-metropolitan-stipendiary-magistrate-ex-parte-pinochet-ugarte-no-2-hl-15-jan-1999/|title = Regina -v- Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No 2); HL 15 Jan 1999 - swarb.co.uk|date = 2015-06-30|website = swarb.co.uk|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Year-round, the Red Bull Music Academy maintains an online magazine, radio station (Red Bull Radio) and lecture video archive. The Academy hosts additional music workshops and club nights and curates stages at festivals in around 60 countries worldwide.

== History ==

The Academy was initiated in 1998 in [[Berlin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tantum|first=Bruce|title=Red Bull Music Academy kicks off its month-long NYC takeover.|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/clubs/interview-red-bull-music-academys-davide-bortot|work=Time Out New York|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has taken place annually in subsequent years in Toronto, London, São Paulo, Seattle, Cape Town, Rome, London, Melbourne, New York, Madrid, Barcelona,Tokyo, Paris, Montréal and Dublin. While the first few editions saw a greater emphasis on DJ culture, the program and recording facilities now accommodate all genres and aspects of the musical spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gentles|first=Tim|title=RBMA NYC Report|url=http://www.dummymag.com/reviews/rbma-nyc-report-review|work=Dummy|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prospective applicants to the Academy must prepare a demo CD of their work, be it original productions, songs or a DJ set, along with a completed questionnaire, and mail it to a Red Bull Music Academy office in [[Cologne]], Germany. From there, each application is taken into consideration, with no quota on country or musical genre. From these applications, 60 are selected and broken down into two groups of 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roper|first=Chris|title=Just Do Your Own Thing|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-12-02-just-do-your-own-thing|newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each group of 30 is flown in to the location of the respective year's event for one of two fortnightly "terms".

The '''Serious Games Showcase and Challenge''' is a competition and a showcase event that was created to encourage [[video game developer]]s to create products that are useful for non-entertainment purposes. The annual event made its first appearance as an exhibit space at the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation, and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) in 2006. The event accepts games from universities, businesses, and [[Public ownership|government organizations]] as entries in competition for awards prizes.

Each year the event awards a Best Academic, [[Small business|Small Business]], Large Business, and Government Game. Attendees at the conference can also vote on the People's Choice Award.

== Description ==
For the purpose of the Challenge, entries will be considered a game if they involve an assigned challenge and employ some form of positive and/or negative reward system.

Entries will be considered a [[serious game]] if they use these gaming attributes to overcome a designated problem or deficiency, and provide appropriate [[feedback]] to the user about their efforts. Entered games must target users at the high school level, at a minimum.

Finalists will be selected by a panel of leaders in the gaming, industry and academic fields, and will be invited to showcase their serious game at [[Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference|I/ITSEC]], where attendees will view and vote on each of the finalists. Awards will be presented to the top finishers in each category.

The Challenge is open to a wide range of contestants. Potential categories include student, individual ([[Indie gaming|indie game]] developer) / government and business. [[Personal computer game|PC game]] entries (or compiled for PC execution) will be accepted from virtually any application areas including "mods", mobile, virtual worlds and original development. Gaming content can be focused on any [[genre]] such as business, education or government.

All entries will be judged by representatives in leading gaming, academic and industry companies in three primary areas, solution to a stated problem, technical quality and playability.
Entries should clearly define the problem or need that is being addressed, as well as the gaming or game technology solution involved. Each entry must be not only technologically sound in its development, delivery and [[user interface]], but also engaging, enjoyable, and easy to use, providing a challenging and rewarding experience to the user.

Innovative approaches to any of the entered solutions are specifically encouraged and rewarded in the scoring.

== Awards ==
* '''Best Student Game''' In order to be eligible for an award, a student team must be composed of students who are actively enrolled in a [[Higher education|post-secondary]] institution such as a college, [[Vocational school|trade school]], or university. The winning team receives recognition at SGS&amp;C; the winning individual or team receives a plaque.
* '''Best Individual or Small Business Game''' Individuals or small businesses are eligible for this category. In order to be eligible for an award, a small business team must be composed of members who are currently employed by businesses that have 500 or fewer employees at the time of the game submission. The winning individual or team receives a plaque.
* '''Best Government Lab Game''' This category is aimed at government labs internally developing serious games. A [[government agency]] sponsoring a game through a contractor would be submitted by the contractor that as a business entry.
* '''Best Large Business Game''' In order to be eligible for an award, a large business team must be composed of members who are currently employed by businesses that have 500 or more employees at the time of game submission. The winning team receives a plaque.

The '''Teatro Comunale Ponchielli''', as it has been known since 1986,&lt;ref name="Lynn"&gt;Lynn, pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[opera house]] located in [[Cremona]], [[Italy]]. For more than 250 years it has been that city's primary venue for opera and other theatrical presentations. 

The original theatre, built in 1747, was named the '''Teatro Nazari''', but it was renamed as    the '''Teatro della Società''' in 1785. It was sometimes referred to as the '''Nobile Associazione'''. After the original theatre burned down in 1806, construction began on the present theatre soon after. The current theatre was designed by [[Luigi Canonica]] and it opened in 1808 under the name the '''Teatro della Concordia'''. Its name was changed again to the '''Teatro Ponchielli''' in 1907 after the famous native of Cremona, [[Amilcare Ponchielli]]. 

In 1986 the theatre was purchased by the city of Cremona&lt;ref name="Lynn"/&gt; which renamed it once again as it is known today. The opening performance took place on 4 October and featured performances on the city-owned [[Stradivarius]] "Il Cremonese" and [[Guarneri]] "del Gesu" violins of 1715 and 1734 respectively.&lt;ref name="Lynn"/&gt;

With its original horseshoe-shaped auditorium, the theatre was remodeled in 1989 to create three box tiers and two galleries with a total of 1,249 seats.

'''The Button''' was an online [[meta-game]] and [[social experiment]] that featured an [[Online and offline|online]] button and 60 second countdown timer that would reset each time the button was pressed. The experiment was hosted on the [[Social networking service|social networking website]] [[Reddit]] beginning on 1 April 2015 ([[April Fools' Day]]) and was active until 5 June 2015. The game was started by a Reddit administrator.&lt;ref name="Mashable button"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2015/04/01/reddit-the-button-april-fools/|publisher=[[Mashable]]|title=Reddit taunts users with a simple button for April Fools' Day|date=2 April 2015|access-date=7 April 2015|first1=Brian|last1=Koerber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Button garnered enthusiasm from Reddit users worldwide,&lt;ref name="BBC Article"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32660378|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=What Reddit's 'ridiculous' button tells us about mortality|date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; attracting clicks from over one million unique user accounts.&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/techtank/posts/2015/04/27-reddit-button|publisher=[[Brookings Institution|Brookings]]|title=Have you pressed the button? |date=27 April 2015|access-date=7 April 2015|first1=Joshua|last1=Bleiberg|first2=Darrell|last2=West}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various websites, browser extensions, and mobile applications were created for tracking the live statistics of the Button and enabling users to visit the Button when the timer dropped below a certain threshold.&lt;ref name="Boing2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/04/05/realtime-chart-of-the-button.html|publisher=[[Boing Boing]]|title=Realtime chart of "the button" game on Reddit|date=5 April 2015|access-date=7 April 2015|first1=Mark|last1=Frauenfelder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Button's countdown timer reached zero several times due to technical issues, but was reset when button press attempts were still being made. On 5 June 2015, the countdown timer reached zero with no button press attempts, ending the experiment. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redditblog.com/2015/06/the-button-has-ended.html|title=The Button has ended.|publisher=[[Reddit]]|date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific Reddit community ([[Reddit#Subreddits|subreddit]]) for the Button had the standard Reddit appearance but with a [[molly-guard]]ed button next to a 60-second countdown timer at the top of the page. When the button was clicked, the countdown would reset.&lt;ref name="Independent Article"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/whatever-you-do-dont-click-this-button-10150775.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|title=Whatever you do, don't click this button|date=2 April 2015|first1=Christopher|last1=Hooton|access-date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The button could only be pressed once by each unique Reddit account created before the event started on 1 April.&lt;ref name="DailyDot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/reddit-the-button/|publisher=[[The Daily Dot]]|title=A mysterious blue button is driving Reddit insane|date=2 April 2015|access-date=7 April 2015|first1=Mike|last1=Wehner}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a cumulative count of all unique users who had clicked the button since its launch.&lt;ref name="GEEK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/news/reddits-april-fools-joke-is-a-mysterious-button-and-people-are-still-pressing-it-1619504/|publisher=[[Geek.com]]|title=Reddit’s April Fools’ joke is a mysterious button, and people are still pressing it|date=2 April 2015|access-date=7 April 2015|first1=Ryan|last1=Whitwam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Button was a light blue color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/reddit/reddit-plugin-thebutton/blob/master/reddit_thebutton/public/static/css/thebutton.less#L155|title=Reddit's The Button source code on Github|date=24 March 2015|accessdate = 21 November 2016|first1=Matthew|last1=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All users received a small dot called a "flair" next to their username. Users who had not pressed the button had a grey dot, and users who had pressed it had a dot colored based on the state of the timer when the button was pressed. When hovering the cursor over this colored dot, the time in seconds on the counter when the user clicked the button would be displayed.&lt;ref name=vox&gt;{{Cite web|title = The button: the fascinating social experiment driving Reddit crazy|url = https://www.vox.com/2015/4/10/8383165/reddit-button-explained|website = Vox|accessdate = 4 August 2015|date = 14 April 2015|last = Lee|first = Timothy B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the subreddit, users' times and the subsequent flair colors became status symbols.&lt;ref name=DailyDot /&gt;&lt;ref name=vox /&gt;

==History==
The button was introduced on 1 April 2015 in a post to the official Reddit blog.&lt;ref name="Introductionpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redditblog.com/2015/04/the-button.html|title=Introduction of the button|website=[[Reddit]]|access-date=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2015, at 21:49:53 [[UTC]], a person with Reddit username "BigGoron" became the last user to press the button (dubbed "The Pressiah" by the community).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redditblog.com/2015/06/the-button-has-ended.html|title=The Button has ended.|publisher=[[Reddit]]|date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty seconds later, the countdown timer reached zero and ended 2 months and 4 days after it had begun. The button was deactivated, and overlaid with the text "the experiment is over".&lt;ref name="Reddit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Knightsofthebutton/comments/38q9x5/the_button_and_necromancer_postmortem/|publisher=[[Reddit]]|title=The button and Necromancer postmortem game on Reddit|date=5 June 2015|access-date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six minutes later, Reddit administrator and creator of the button "powerlanguage" announced the forum would be archived within ten minutes.&lt;ref name="subarchived"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/38q4u3/when_this_post_is_10_minutes_old_this_subreddit/|title=When this post is 10 minutes old, this subreddit will be archived|website=[[Reddit]]|date=5 June 2015}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment ended with 1,008,316 logged button clicks.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web|title=/r/thebutton statistics|url=http://button.cstevens.me/|publisher=Chr12t0pher|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical issues==
The Button experienced technical issues which caused it to reach zero despite users pressing it in time. This occurred multiple times and was attributed to [[database]] errors by reddit's administrators. The outages caused community discontentment and some speculation that the subreddit was being [[Gaming the system|gamed]] by the administrators.&lt;ref name="error3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/250421/redditors-freak-out-as-erroneous-post-claims-the-button-experiment-had-ended/|title=Redditors freak out as erroneous post claims The Button Experiment had ended|publisher=Death and Taxes|date=30 May 2015|access-date=5 June 2015|first1=Jordan|last1=Freiman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="error1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/05/22/the-button-on-reddit-has-finally-hit-zero_n_7421660.html|title=The 'Button' On Reddit Has Finally Hit Zero|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=22 May 2015|access-date=5 June 2015|first1=Tamblyn|last1=Tamblyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although The Button was revived within a day of the outages, the administrators of Reddit considered closing The Button experiment early.&lt;ref name="error2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/317slw/update_flair_and_outages/|title=Update: flair and outages|website=[[Reddit]]|access-date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community interaction ==
The inherent segregation on this specific Reddit community ([[Reddit#Subreddits|subreddit]]) lead to the development of cult-like groups surrounding specific flairs or beliefs towards the button itself. Each individual cult could be easily identified by the color of its flair, represented by the short time frame in which any user pressed the button. Of the cults, the most basic was the division between those that would press the button, “the pressers”, and those that would abstain, “the non-pressers”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/reddit-button-n357841|title=Reddit Explains the Mystery Behind 'The Button'|last=Pepitone|first=Julianne|date=9 June 2015|website=NBC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/3167qx/45_master_race/cpz3e5n/|title=45 master race • r/thebutton|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; More so, a unique cult formed over each of the six other colored flairs. The separate cults all held their own beliefs surrounding what might happen when the clock reached zero.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A public image surrounding each cult eventually developed. Some, such as the “grey” flair given to those who would not press the button, or the “red” flair given to those that pressed it when the timer showed 0-11 seconds, were regarded as pretentious and arrogant about their beliefs, and hostile towards newcomers. Others, however, like the “purple” flair given to those that pressed the button between 52-60 seconds, were seen as compassionate and welcoming to new members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/video/the-peoples-history-of-the-button-social-experiment-or-reddit-prank-460688451606|title=The People's History of The Button: Social Experiment or Reddit Prank?|last=|first=|date=9 June 2015|website=NBC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, each cult maintained a public image through the use of dressed and color-coded mascots.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/reddits-the-button-game-is-over-1709950930|title=Reddit's 'The Button' Game Is Over|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|date=8 June 2015|website=Kotaku|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, names arose to represent each of the cults, such as “The Emerald Council” for the green flair, or “The Violet Hand” for the purple flair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Emerald_Council/comments/31i63f/the_looming_yellow/|title=The Emerald Council subreddit|last=|first=|date=|website=www.reddit.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Eventually the community built around the button referred to the colored flairs not by their color, but by the name given to the cults representing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/31z8u0/how_about_we_skip_34_seconds/cq6d4oa/|title=How about we skip 34 seconds? • r/thebutton|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the larger group of the grey flair, those who would not press the button, smaller cults formed with unique beliefs to others that also held the grey flair. Of these, the most prominent was the “Knights of The Button”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/08/reddits-mysterious-button-experiment-is-over|title=Reddit's Mysterious Button Experiment Is Over|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=8 June 2015|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/3174r3/announcing_the_knights_of_the_button/|title=Announcing: The Knights of the Button • r/thebutton|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this cult attempted to prevent the button from ever reaching zero by pressing it before the clock could fully descend.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The 'Knights' went so far as to create an algorithm associated with a large pool of thousands of “[[Sockpuppet (Internet)|dummy]]” accounts to press the button automatically before it could reach zero. However, of these accounts, one was not verified to have been created prior to April 1st, 2015 and therefore was unable to press the button, permitting it to finally reach zero.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/388rm1/the_knights_have_fallen|title=The Knights have fallen. • r/thebutton|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Eternity Man''''' is a [[chamber opera]] in one act and seven scenes by the Australian composer [[Jonathan Mills (composer)|Jonathan Mills]] to a libretto by [[Dorothy Porter]]. It deals with the life of [[Arthur Stace]] who was known as "The Eternity Man" because he chalked the word "[[Eternity (graffito)|Eternity]]" about 500,000 times in over 35 years on [[Sydney]]'s walls and footpaths.

The opera is written for four voices. These include the voice of Stace himself ([[baritone]]) and three female characters ([[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], [[contralto]]) who represent alternatively Stace's sister, Myrtle; a [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]] brothel keeper; and an assortment of female choruses – female freaks at the [[Sydney Royal Easter Show]] and also ghosts of female convicts and a gaggle of [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] [[drag queen]]s. A performance lasts for about 70 minutes.__NOTOC__&lt;!-- too short --&gt;
==Performance history==
The work was [[Commission (art)|commissioned]] by and premiered at London's [[Almeida Theatre]] on 23 July 2003, conducted by Stuart Stratford, production by [[Benedict Andrews]], with singers Richard Jackson, Tara Harrison, Claire McCaldin and Andee-Louise Hippolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The V8 Supertourer is a New Zealand racing car based on a "Car-of-the-Future" prototype built by Paul Ceprnich of Pace Innovations Australia similar to that of the Australian [[V8 Supercars|V8 Supercar]] series. It was designed to be customised to many different manufacturers vehicles including a [[Holden VE Commodore]], [[Ford FG Falcon]], [[Toyota Camry]] or [[BMW 5 Series]]. Testing started in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedcafe.com.au/2011/04/19/first-v8-supertourers-to-test-tomorrow/|title=First V8SuperTourers to test tomorrow|publisher=SpeedCafe|date= 2011-04-19|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The V8SuperTourer Championship was run by V8SuperTourers Limited, a company formed by former [[New Zealand V8s|NZV8]] team owners Mark Petch, Wayne Anderson and Garry Pedersen.

The aim of the company was to build a new V8 touring car, similar to a current Australian V8 Supercar but at less than half the cost. The V8SuperTourer was designed to have performance similar to that of a current Australian V8 Supercar and was designed for both sprint and long distance racing, including a 120-litre capacity fuel cell.

The '''V8SuperTourers Championship''' was the name of the motor racing series in New Zealand which started in 2012 to coincide with the release of the Supertourer but changed direction in 2015. The series later became known as the '''NZV8 Touring Car Championship''' and is now the leading tier one V8 Championship in the country.

==The V8SuperTourer car==
[[File:Greg Murphy 2014 Car.jpg|thumb|#1 Greg Murphy]]
Designed and built by Paul Ceprnich of Pace Innovations Australia, the V8SuperTourer prototype uses a [[Holden VE Commodore]] body mounted on a purpose-built chassis. The chassis, like the Australian V8 Supercar car of the future (or COTF) project, is built to not only accommodate both the current VE Commodore and [[Ford FG Falcon]] bodies, but any other similar sized four-dour production vehicle such a [[Toyota Camry]] or [[BMW 5 Series]]. Interested vehicle manufacturers of four-door saloon cars of a similar size to the Holden Commodore VE and Ford FG Falcon models can apply to race in the series.

The V8SuperTourer uses a strictly-controlled, one make, all-alloy, fuel injected and dry sumped 7-litre V8 ST engine. The power-plant is derived from the Le Mans [[Chevrolet Corvette C6.R|Corvette C6.R]] programme and is hand-built in the [[United States]]. It delivers 550 horsepower at 6,800 revs per minute and is expected to have a racing life of 10,000 kilometres before requiring maintenance. This engine is identical to that of the Mosler Automotives current and very successful GT3 sports-car.

The Link Engine Management, [http://www.linkecu.com/products/engine-management-ecus/g4-xtreme G4 Xtreme] manages the fuel, ignition and [[Electronic throttle control|e-throttle]], [[Powershifting|gear shift cuts]], performance limiting when parameters go "out of range" as well as supplying data to the Race Technology dash.

The drive-train consists of a triple-plate clutch, which delivers engine torque through a Quaife 6-speed sequential transmission via a two-piece pro-shaft feeding a classic 9 Ford differential, which is fitted with a Torsen-style limited slip, crown wheel carrier assembly in order to provide excellent traction in most conditions.

The rear suspension adopts the proven, yet simple in design and maintenance, three-link live rear axle fitted with camber and toe, CV style, floating rear hubs.

The front suspension is a sophisticated clean sheet, double wishbone layout that is also cleverly symmetrical from left to right, thus reducing spares inventories, etc. Both the front and rear suspension oscillations are dampened by adjustable bump and rebound shock absorbers fitted with adjustable spring platforms.
[[File:NZ V8 SuperTourer drivers line up with CEO Paul Radisich for the media on the inaugural test day.jpg|thumb|Drivers with CEO Paul Radisich]]
The rack and pinion power steering assembly is mounted ahead of the engine in order to better optimise the front suspension geometry and the high loads generated under long distance racing events.

The V8SuperTourer uses 11x18 forged alloy wheels carrying 280 x 680 x 18 racing slicks or wet weather radial tyres.

The Brembo brake package, use ventilated 380mm diameter 35&amp;nbsp;mm thick rotors in the front, and 355x32 mm ventilated rotors in the rear. Both the front and rear rotors are fitted with Brembo's super-stiff "forged" billet alloy 6 piston brake callipers, in the front and 4 piston callipers in the rear. This state of the art brake package combines to stop the comparatively light car, which has an all up weight, including driver, of less than 1,300&amp;nbsp;kg, faster than a current supercar.

'''verybello.it''' is an Italian website for the [[Expo 2015]] hosted that year in [[Milan]].

The website was launched in January 2015.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21641269-despite-scandals-and-delays-italy-should-pull-it-mayday-milan|title=World Expo: Mayday in Milan - The Economist|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its early version has attracted criticism for omitting [[Sicily]] from the map of Italy, and for having only the Italian language version present.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; Website design and name have also been criticized.&lt;ref name=ii&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italianinsider.it/?q=node/2705|title="Verybello" spawns veritable words war|work=italianinsider.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Water-sprinkling festival''' (simplified Chinese 泼水节 ; traditional Chinese 潑水節; Pinyin: ''Pōshuǐ jié''), is a traditional festival of the [[Dai people|Dai]] nationality marking the Lunar New Year. The Dai are an ethnic minority of China who primarily live in the [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture]] in southern [[Yunnan]]. The predominant religion of the Dai is [[Theravada Buddhism]] and religious activities are frequent. The Water-sprinkling festival is one of the most solemn traditional festivals of this nationality. Usually, the festival takes place ten days around the Tomb-sweeping day and lasts for three or four days, it generally occurs according to the Gregorian calendar from April 13 to 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnhubei.com/xwzt/2011/2011sxks/gwfq/201107/t1783863.shtml |title=傣族泼水节-荆楚网 www.cnhubei.com |publisher=Cnhubei.com |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Festival of Black Arts''' (French: [[:fr:Festival Mondial des Arts Nègres|Festival Mondial des Arts Nègres]]), also known as '''FESMAN''', is a month-long culture and arts festival that takes place in [[Africa]]. The festival features poetry, sculpture, painting, music, cinema, theatre, fashion, architecture, design and dance from artists and performers from around the [[African Diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90856/6574894.html "World Festival of Black Arts launched at UN Headquarters"], ''People's Daily'', 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festivals were planned as Pan-African celebrations, and ranged in content from debate to performance — particularly dance and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Banham, [[Errol Hill]], George Woodyard (eds), ''The Cambridge Guide to African &amp; Caribbean Literature'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1994; "''FESTAC''", p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In President Wade's 2009 address at the UN, he said: "I call all Africans, all the sons and daughters of the Diaspora, all my fellow citizens, all the partners that are ready to walk by our side, all States, all international organizations, foundations, firms, etc. for a shining success for this Festival, and for the rise of a new Africa." It was curated by [[Kwame Kwei-Armah]], and participants at the opening ceremony included [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Baaba Maal]], [[Angélique Kidjo]], [[Toumani Diabaté]], [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Carlinhos Brown]] and the [[Mahotella Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hannah Pool]], [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jan/03/world-festival-of-black-arts-kwei-armah "World Festival of Black Arts: a once in a decade event"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; As well as music and cinema, the festival featured art exhibitions, theatre and dance performances, fashion shows, photography and other events, with the participation of artists and intellectuals from dozens of African and African diaspora countries, including the US, Brazil, Haiti, France and Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Karima Daoudi, [http://fulbright.mtvu.com/karimadaoudi/2011/03/21/the-world-festival-of-black-arts-and-cultures/ "The World Festival of Black Arts and Cultures"], Fulbright-mtvU Fellows, 21 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Felicia R.

The '''FIA World Touring Car Championship'''  was an international [[touring car racing|touring car]] championship promoted by Eurosport Events and sanctioned by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA). It has had several different incarnations, including a single season in 1987 as the World Touring Car Championship and most recently a world championship (WTCC) that has run between 2005 and 2017. Following the 2017 season, an agreement was reached for the FIA WTCC to become [[World Touring Car Cup|FIA WTCR]] and use the [[TCR Touring Car|TCR]] technical regulations.

==History==

===First season===
[[File:Ford Sierra RS 500 1.jpg|thumb|[[Eggenberger Motorsport]] [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth|Ford Sierra RS500]] of [[Klaus Ludwig]] and [[Klaus Niedzwiedz]]]]
The first World Touring Car Championship, which was open to [[Group A]] Touring Cars, was held in [[1987 World Touring Car Championship|1987]] concurrent to the long-running [[European Touring Car Championship]] (ETCC). Additional rounds were held outside Europe at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]] and [[Calder Park Raceway]] in [[Australia]] (Calder used a combined circuit of the road course and the then newly constructed NASCAR speedway), [[Nissan Mobil 500|Wellington]] in [[New Zealand]] and [[Fuji Speedway|Mount Fuji]] in [[Japan]]. The Championship was well-supported by the factory European teams of [[Ford Europe|Ford]], [[BMW]] and [[Alfa Romeo]] (until Alfa withdrew following the European races), but was embroiled in controversy. Unfortunately, the leading [[BMW Motorsport]] teams and the Ford Europe backed [[Eggenberger Motorsport]] had developed a situation of "you don't protest us, we won't protest you". While this worked well in the European races, when the championship landed in Australia the local teams took exception to the Europeans somewhat liberal interpretation of the Group A rules. Subsequently, the Eggenberger cars were protested against and eventually disqualified from the [[Bathurst 1000]] results.

The championship was provisionally awarded to West German Eggenberger [[Ford Sierra RS500]] drivers [[Klaus Ludwig]] and [[Klaus Niedzwiedz]]. It was not until March 1988 when their Bathurst disqualification was finalised that results were confirmed and Italian [[Schnitzer Motorsport]] driver [[Roberto Ravaglia]] in a [[E30 M3|BMW M3]] was declared the champion. The Entrants Championship was won by the Eggenberger Texaco Ford No 7 entry. The WTCC lasted only one year and was a victim of its own success&amp;nbsp;— the FIA (and [[Bernie Ecclestone]]) feared it would take money away from Formula One and stopped sanctioning the Championship.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} A [[Silhouette racing car|silhouette]] formula championship (proposed by Ecclestone) was announced by the FIA for 1988 which would have seen specialist racing chassis carrying bodywork resembling production roadcars powered by the about to be outlawed Formula One 1.5 litre turbo regulations, but manufacturers did not support the concept. Only one car, based on an [[Alfa Romeo 164]] with a 3.5 litre [[V10 engine]] was built before it was abandoned.

===European Touring Car Championship===
{{main|European Touring Car Championship}}
In 2001, the European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) was resumed with support from the FIA, the precursor to the current WTCC. In 2001, the [[Italian Superturismo Championship]] became the FIA European Super Touring Championship, with an extra class for Super Production cars alongside the main [[Super Touring]] class. In 2002, this evolved into the brand new FIA European Touring Car Championship, using [[Super 2000]] rules, dominated by [[Alfa Romeo]] and [[BMW]], but popular with the public due to the intense competition and [[Eurosport]] live broadcasts.

===Return to World Championship status===
[[File:WTCC 2006 Race 10 Curitiba later.jpg|thumb|Factory-backed [[BMW 3 Series (E90)|BMW 320si]], [[Alfa Romeo 156]], [[SEAT León]], and [[Daewoo Lacetti|Chevrolet Lacetti]] in the [[2006 World Touring Car Championship|2006 season]].]]
At the request of interested manufacturers, the ETCC was changed to the current WTCC beginning with the 2005 season, continuing to use [[Super 2000]] and [[Diesel 2000]] regulations. [[2004 European Touring Car Championship|2004 ETCC]] Champion [[Andy Priaulx]] and his [[BMW 3 Series (E46)|BMW 320i]] were the dominant driver-car pairing during the first three years of the revived championship, winning the [[2005 World Touring Car Championship|2005]], [[2006 World Touring Car Championship|2006]] and [[2007 World Touring Car Championship|2007]] Drivers and Manufacturers Championships.

In 2008, Frenchman [[Yvan Muller]] won the title after Race 1 in Macau in his [[SEAT León|SEAT León TDI]]. This marked the first time an FIA sanctioned world championship, in any category, being won by a diesel powered racing car. [[SEAT León|SEAT León TDI]] won both championships for a second time in 2009, this time in the hands of [[Gabriele Tarquini]].

[[File:2012 WTCC Race of Japan (Race 1) opening lap.jpg|thumb|Race start at the [[2012 FIA WTCC Race of Japan]].]]
2010 marked the start of [[Chevrolet]]'s dominance of the championship with its [[Chevrolet Cruze|Cruze]] model. Frenchman [[Yvan Muller]] became World Champion, fending off tough competition from [[Gabriele Tarquini]] and [[Andy Priaulx]] to win the first world championship for [[Chevrolet]]. Muller continued his success into 2011, winning both drivers championship and helping Chevrolet to its second manufacturers championship after Muller's two teammates finished second and third in the drivers standings. This gave Chevrolet a clean sweep of both titles. The 2012 championship saw Chevrolet pick up where they left off in 2011, leading to a second year of championship clean sweeps, this time with [[Robert Huff|Rob Huff]] taking the drivers title.

The modern series has held events based all around the world including races in [[Argentina]], [[Morocco]], [[Hungary]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Slovakia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Thailand]] and [[Qatar]] with former races in  [[Brazil]], [[Great Britain]], [[Italy]], [[Macau]], [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]] and the [[United States]].

Technical rules were modified in 2011 to allow 1.6L turbo gasoline engines, and the 2.0L gasoline and turbodiesel engines were outlawed in 2012. In 2014, new car regulations were introduced with the name TC1, with larger wings and more engine power. The old 1.6L turbo cars were renamed TC2 for a year and were dropped for 2015.

==Car regulations==
The WTCC uses [[Super 2000]] and [[Diesel 2000]] cars, as cost control is a major theme in the technical regulation. Super 2000 engines are 1.6 L turbo-charged 4-cylinder engines producing approximately 380 bhp. Wheels are 18" in diameter, and large front and rear aerodynamic devices are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2014/04/09/a-new-era-for-the-wtcc-preview-guide-to-2014/ |title=TouringCarTimes - A new era for the WTCC – preview &amp; guide to 2014 |date=2014-04-19 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many technologies that have featured in production cars are not allowed, including [[variable valve timing]], [[Variable Length Intake Manifold|variable intake geometry]], [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS brakes]] and [[traction control system]].

==Scoring system==

===Current scoring system===
Currently, all WTCC races are awarded equal points. From 2010, these points have been based on the FIA's points system used in the FIA Formula One Championship and the FIA World Rally Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/article.php?id=4454|title=New point system for WTCC|work=TouringCarTimes|publisher=Mediaempire Stockholm AB|first=Neil|last=Hudson|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
