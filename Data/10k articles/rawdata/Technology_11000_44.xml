An '''air knife''' is a tool used to blow off liquid or debris from products as they travel on conveyors.  Air knives are normally used in [[manufacturing]] or as the first step in a [[recursive recycling]] process to separate lighter or smaller particles from other components for use in later or subsequent steps, post manufacturing parts drying and conveyor cleaning, part of component cleaning. The knife consists of a high-intensity, uniform sheet of [[laminar flow|laminar airflow]] sometimes known as [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]] flow.

An industrial air knife is a pressurized air plenum containing a series of holes or continuous slots through which pressurized air exits in a laminar flow pattern. The exit air velocity then creates an impact air velocity onto the surface of whatever object the air is directed. This impact air velocity can range from a gentle breeze to greater than [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.6 (40,000&amp;nbsp;ft/min) to alter the surface of a product without mechanical contact.

Air knives remove liquids, control the thickness of liquids, dry the liquid coatings, remove foreign particles, cool product surfaces or create a hold down force to assist in the mechanical bonding of materials to the surface. Electrical currents from anti-static bars can also be injected into the exit air knife stream to neutralize the static electricity charge on some surfaces.

In the majority of manufacturing applications for air knives, the air knives are stationary while the product passes through the air velocity air stream. In other circumstances, the product is stationary and the air knives move (reciprocate or rotate) over the surface of the stationary product. Although there are very few applications where an air knife can actually cut a product (break mechanical bonds between two points), air knives are often the most efficient method of removing or controlling unwanted or foreign substances on any surface.

==History==
In the 1950s and 60s, the term "'''air doctor'''" was first used to refer to the non-contact method of debris blow-off using compressed air. The printing and textile industries were some of the largest users of air doctors at that time. They often needed wide paths of air from a compressed air system to control the thickness of liquids on a surface, or to blow debris off the surface of materials prior to the next process. Other terms used were air bar, air squeegee, air curtain, air jet, air blast, air blow off, air nozzle, air comb, air blade and air [[doctor blade]]. Today the most commonly used term is simply "air knife".

Although air knives powered by compressed plant air are used in a wide variety of industrial applications, industrial blower-powered air knives have proven to reduce the energy usage versus compressed air knives by 50–75% for most applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=VanderPyl|first1=Daniel J.|title=Advances in Blow-Off Drying Systems and Air Knives|journal=PCI Magazine|date=1 August 2007|url=http://www.pcimag.com/articles/95007-advances-in-blow-off-drying-systems-and-air-knives|accessdate=28 November 2016|publisher=BNP Media|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912091826/http://www.pcimag.com/articles/95007-advances-in-blow-off-drying-systems-and-air-knives|archive-date=2015-09-12|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blower-powered air knife systems came of age with the advent of the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], which started the clock on the worldwide phase-out of atmospheric ozone depleting CFC’s ([[chlorofluorocarbons]]) then used as cleaning agents in many industries.

Most of these solvent-based cleaning agents simply evaporated which required no blow-off or other drying methods. Although the printed circuit board industry was still in its infancy, it was among the first to initiate the conversion to aqueous and semi-aqueous-based parts cleaning systems.

With nearly every existing and all future circuit board factories using the new environmentally friendly cleaning technology, they also needed a new method of drying the p.c. boards following their water-based cleaning to remove solder fluxes and other contaminants. The trend away from other types of solvent-based parts cleaning to water-based cleaning for other industries began soon thereafter. Additionally, the conversion to water-based inks, paints, coatings, adhesives and other solutions used in various manufacturing sectors has resulted in the need for air knife dryers where none had previously existed. As a result of the Montreal Protocol and worldwide industry compliance with environmental stewardship mandates, the former niche business of air knives became an industry.

==Description of operation==
Air knives on a production line commonly range from {{convert|0.25|to|200|in}} in length with a discharge air slot or holes ranging from {{convert|0.001|to|0.25|in|abbr=on}}. A stationary air knife configuration can require from one to a dozen air knives depending on the application criteria. Air is blasted through the air knife slots via an air generator, either an industrial blower or air compressor, to deliver the predetermined exit air volume and velocity needed.

There are many application, environmental, efficiency and duty cycle aspects to consider when choosing between compressors and blowers. Compressed air, which is least efficient when used for air knives discharging into free air, allows for use of primary plant air. The piping sizes supplying the air knives can be as little as {{convert|1/4|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter, so they are ideal for confined spaces. Blower-powered air knives must be larger in size along with larger diameter supply piping, but the efficiency improvement over compressed air is easily justified with the electrical power cost savings.

Air knife designs today have evolved to where some manufacturers produce a very efficient “teardrop” shape with a .95 coefficient of discharge. These blower-powered air knife designs typically have a profile of approximately {{convert|3.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide x {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} tall x any length, but the teardrop profile can range from {{convert|1.5|to|10|in|mm|abbr=on}} tall depending on the criteria of the product for which the impact air velocity must be engineered. With construction ranging from {{convert|1/8|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick aluminum extrusion to 11 gauge fabricated stainless steel, air knives can weigh 1&amp;nbsp;lb/ft to 25&amp;nbsp;lbs/ft. Depending on the width and speed of the product, the air knife can provide effective blow-off performance from {{convert|0.5|to|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} or more away from the surface of the product. Round air nozzles of {{convert|1|to|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter can be effective against surfaces which are up to several feet (1 to 2 meters) from the product surface when engineered for such applications.

==Types and applications==
The most common use of air knives is to contain or remove free-standing materials (liquids or solids) from the surface of material. The applications include drying bottles and cans after filling and rinsing, printed circuit boards following the conveyorized wash to remove solder paste and flux, metals castings after automatic machining and many more. They can also deliver heated or cooled air to a surface, or create an invisible air barrier to separate heated or cooled environments from one another in industrial applications such as continuous metal heat treating ovens, cold process or storage areas in food processing or dust containment for the entrance to clean rooms.

There is a variety of uses for air knives in many different industries, applications and environments. The invisible-high velocity air streams can be discharged by air knife designs of numerous shapes and sizes. These range from “garage built” devices with a low level of precision to the most exotic metals of construction used in air knives for class 100 clean rooms.

In instances where noise reduction and moisture containment around a conveyorized air knife installation becomes important, some manufacturing facilities have installed air knives within an enclosure. These enclosures keep water contained, reduce the amount of air knife noise and even eliminate any liquid that could create safety concerns.

==Basic design features==
===Compressed air-powered air knives===

There has always been a wide assortment of blow-off appliances. Air knives and nozzles for compressed air blow-off range from home made round pipes with holes to engineered high pressure air knives. In order to achieve the highest efficiency using compressed air, many manufacturers of compressed air knives utilize the [[Coandă effect]] to improve compressed air knife design over other types of knives and nozzles. Although the efficiency of compressed air for low-pressure blow-off air is much lower than blowers, the Coanda-inspired air knives entrain ambient air into the high-velocity stream to enhance the blow off effect.

===Blower-powered air knives===
The teardrop-shaped air knife has a bulbous plenum which tapers down to a precise air discharge slot as the standard of the blower driven air knife industry. Whereas a round pipe with holes drilled has an average coefficient of discharge of 0.6 (60% efficient), the teardrop-shaped air knife is commonly 0.95 (95% efficient), which provides much higher-impact air velocity to the surface at which the air is directed with the lowest blower motor power demand. These teardrop designs are available in extruded aluminum shapes as well as fabricated carbon and stainless steels.

===OSHA compliance===

Information is needed regarding the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and their standards and directives on Compressed Air, especially when used for cleaning.

The '''Army Battle Command System (ABCS)''' is a digital Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence ([[C4I]]) system for the US Army. It includes a mix of fixed/semi-fixed and mobile networks.  It is also designed for interoperability with US and Coalition C4I systems.

Army Battle Command System (ABCS) Version 6.4 is an integrated suite that allows troops to obtain an automated view of friendly activity and supply movement; plan fires, receive situation and intelligence reports, view the airspace and receive automatically disseminated weather reports.

==Advantages==

*  Provides up-to-date logistical information on a map-based display. 
*  Provides for electronic messaging and data exchange with the Army Battle Command System (ABCS) and Movement Tracking System (MTS).
*  ABCS 6.4 allows for a System of Systems (SoS) concept. Ultimately, the SoS will essentially provide the soldiers with the same type of service that the Internet provides to civilians. In the commercial environment, customers can access the Internet from separate computers without even knowing the location of the network they are attached to. In the future, US soldiers will have a similar capability when using ABCS.
*  ABCS 6.4 is an integrated set of systems that will allow a commander to see multiple systems on one screen and seamlessly pass data from one program to the next.
*  High levels of integration allow soldiers to more efficiently exploit the tactical network.
*  Systems such as AMDWS and FAAD allow for Joint Certified Communications such as JREAP-C

==Disadvantages==
* These family of systems does not integrate well with GCCS Family of systems which are the DOD Joint Systems.
* Corruption of GCCS databases and thus the Common Operational Picture (COP) are very likely when in joint operations
* Track looping concerns become high risk in Joint Operations.
* ABCS is highly dependent on well established communication pipe lines except for FBCB2 &amp; JCR.
* There is no data standardization verification done at the central repository thus invalid data is possible.

==Systems==

ABCS combines six packages into a single system:
# The [[Project Manager Battle Command#Maneuver Control System|Maneuver Control System]] (MCS) allows the operator to define routes and view overlays to provide situational awareness. MCS is being phased out and replaced with "Lightning", an ABCS enabled Flash/Java Program that uses the Web Browser interface. It allows users to publish products from CPOF without using the BCS (Battle Command Server) PASS (Publish and Subscribe Service) Server, making Lightning more flexible as it can be used on any Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet-System) as there is no interface software required besides your web browser (Typically IE 8.0 or higher, not compatible with Opera or Firefox at this time.) The system was developed and integrated by [[Ford Aerospace|Ford Aerospace and Communications Corp.]] (FACC), [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4293012;view=1up;seq=92 Army Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Funds], Hearings, 1985, pt. 7, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Air and Missile Defense Workstations (AMDWS) provide soldiers with an Air Defense picture, and supports the Surface Launched Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (SLAM-RAAM) Air Defense Artillery (ADA) system by providing an automated defense planning capability for deployed units.
# The Battle Command Sustainment &amp; Support System (BCS3) integrates multiple data sources into one program and provides commanders with a visual layout of battlefield logistics.
# The All Source Analysis System (ASAS) can analyze incidents and help determine the patterns of Improvised Explosive Device-related incidents.  A commander can determine locations that are typical for IED attacks, so that they know to warn their soldiers of such a threat.
# The [[Project Manager Battle Command#Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS)|Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System]] (AFATDS) plan and execute fires during each phase of action, whether a deliberate attack or defensive operation. AFATDS is fielded to all Active Component Army and Marine Corps units.  About 90% of the National Guard has been fielded. AFATDS is installed on large-deck amphibious assault vessels of the United States Navy.
# [[FBCB2|The Force XXI Battle Command, Brigade &amp; Below]]/[[Blue Force Tracking]] (FBCB2/BFT) system uses satellite and terrestrial communications technology to track and display friendly vehicles and aircraft that appear on a computer screen as blue icons over a topographical map or satellite image of the ground. Commanders and Soldiers can add red icons that show up as enemy on the screen, and are simultaneously broadcast to all the other FBCB2/BFT users on the battlefield. There are about 15,000 FBCB2/BFT systems in use today.
# The Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS) is an automated system for battlefield airspace management.

Additional systems that are integrated with the ABCS suite include:
*  Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS) Provides digital Terrain Analysis, terrain data base(s), updated terrain products, and hard copy repro, in support of Terrain Visualization, IPB, C2, and Battle Staff DMP (CORPS/DIV/BDE).
*  The Global Command and Control System - Army ([[GCCS-A]]) provides a common picture of Army tactical operations to the Joint and Coalition community, and facilitates interoperability of systems across Army/Joint theaters, however no true synchronization occurs with PASS/DDS which introducing many issues on the battlefield for Soldiers, Marines, Sailors and Air force personnel.  This issue can potentially put their lives at risk.
*  The Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS) provides Commanders at all echelons with an automated weather system to receive, process, and disseminate weather observations, forecasts, and weather and environmental effects decision aids for ABCS.
* The [[Command Post of the Future]] (CPOF) application communicates with ABCS through GCCS-J, DDS/PASS and other means.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3239">'''Autonomous trucks''' is a concept for autonomous vehicles applied for commercial uses.

==History==
As recorded in June 1995 in [[Popular Science Magazine]], self-driving trucks were being developed for combat convoys, whereby only the lead truck would be driven by a human and the following trucks would rely on [[satellite]], an [[inertial guidance system]] and ground-speed sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Ray|title="Leave The Driving To Us"|date=June 1995|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, trucks from major manufacturers including [[Volvo]] and the [[Daimler Company]] completed a week of autonomous driving across [[Europe]], organized by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], in an effort to get self-driving trucks on the road. With developments in self-driving trucks progressing, U.S. self-driving truck sales is forecast to reach 60,000 by 2035 according to a report released by [[IHS Inc.]] in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IHS Clarifies Autonomous Vehicle Sales Forecast – Expects 21 Million Sales Globally in the Year 2035 and Nearly 76 Million Sold Globally Through 2035 |date=9 June 2016 |url=http://news.ihsmarkit.com/press-release/automotive/autonomous-vehicle-sales-set-reach-21-million-globally-2035-ihs-says |publisher=IHS Markit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rucksack Schweizer Armee 1960er a.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Swiss army]] backpack {{circa}} 1960]]
[[File:Rucksack Schweizer Armee 1960er b.jpg|150px|thumb|Integrated bearer (internal) frame]]

A '''backpack'''—also called  '''bookbag''', '''knapsack''', '''rucksack''', '''rucksac''', '''pack''', '''sackpack''' or '''backsack'''—is, in its simplest frameless form, a cloth sack carried on one's back and secured with two straps that go over the shoulders, but it can have an external frame, internal frame, and there are bodypacks.

Backpacks are commonly used by [[hiking|hikers]] and [[student]]s, and are often preferred to [[handbag]]s for carrying heavy loads or carrying any sort of equipment, because of the limited capacity to carry heavy weights for long periods of time in the hands.

Large backpacks, used to carry loads over {{convert|10|kg|lb}}, as well as smaller sports backpacks (e.g. running, cycling, hiking and hydration), usually offload the largest part (up to about 90%) of their weight onto padded hip belts, leaving the shoulder straps mainly for stabilising the load. This improves the potential to carry heavy loads, as the hips are stronger than the shoulders, and also increases agility and balance, since the load rides nearer the wearer's own center of [[mass]].

==Terminology==
The word '''backpack''' was coined in the United States in the 1910s. ''Moneybag'' and ''packsack'' were used prior, and now occur mainly as [[Dialect|regionalisms]].

The word '''rucksack''' is a German [[loanword]] mainly used in the UK, US and in other Western military forces. In German, ''Rücken'' means "back" and ''Sack'' means "bag". The name rucksack is cognate with the Danish ''rygsæk'', Norwegian ''ryggsekk'', Dutch ''rugzak'', Afrikaans ''rugsak'', Swedish ''ryggsäck'', and Russian ''рюкзак''.

The word '''knapsack''' was the usual name for a rucksack or backpack up until the middle of the 20th century. This is commonly used in [[Canada]].

Alternative names include [[haversack]] from the German ''Hafersack'' meaning "oat sack"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haversack|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/haversack|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which more properly describes a small cloth bag on a strap worn over one shoulder and originally referred to the bag of [[oats]] carried as horse fodder), ''Kraxe'' (a German rucksack with a rigid framework), and ''bergen'' (a large load-carrying rucksack, from a design issued by the British Army during the Second World War).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nam.ac.uk/online-collection/detail.php?acc=1982-11-144-1 National Army Museum: Bergen rucksack, War Department issue]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Britons used to call Alpine-style backpacks "Bergen rucksacks", maybe from the name of their creator, Norwegian [[Ole F. Bergan]], combined with the name of the Norwegian city of [[Bergen]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016|reason=}}

Backpacks can often simply be referred to as "packs", especially in outdoors contexts; though sometimes ambiguous compared to other bags such as [[saddlebag]]s and [[duffel bag]]s, context is generally sufficient for identification. They are also used in recreational activities, and have long since been used to carry sports equipment and other materials.

Long before its various terminologies began appearing in print, evidence of early backpacks was scarce. A contender for the earliest was found within the mummified remains of [[Ötzi]] in 3300BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Backpack: Everything You Could Ever Need To Know|url=https://mahileather.com/blogs/news/the-backpack-everything-you-could-ever-need-to-know|website=MAHI Leather|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backpacks in general fall into one of four categories: frameless, external frame, internal frame, and bodypack. A pack frame, when present, serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body more appropriately, by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs. Most of the weight is therefore taken off the shoulders, reducing the chance of injury from shoulder strap pressure (many backpacks equipped solely with shoulder straps can affect the posture of a person carrying more than 14&amp;nbsp;kg (30&amp;nbsp;lbs)), as well as being less restrictive of the upper body range of motion. Most backpacks are capable of being closed with either a [[buckle]] mechanism, a [[zipper]], or a dry-bag type closure, though a few models use a drawstring fitted with a [[cord lock]] for the main compartment.

A bodypack is a backpack fitted with one or more pockets that are suspended on the wearer's chest and loaded in such a way that the load in the front and the load in the back are close to equal. The majority of the load in a bodypack is carried by the hips. The ideal load carrying system should not disturb the wearer's natural posture, balance and maneuverability. The load must be dispersed onto the skeletal structure in an even manner, and should not produce unbalanced forces on the body.

===Frameless===
The simplest backpack design is a bag attached to a set of shoulder straps. Such packs are used for general transportation of goods, and have variable capacity. The simplest designs consist of one main pocket. This may be combined with [[webbing]] or [[Rope|cordage]] straps, while more sophisticated models add extra pockets, waist straps, chest straps, padded shoulder straps, padded backs, and sometimes reflective materials for added safety at night. These packs are generally produced inexpensively.

Some outdoor packs, particularly those sold for day hikes, [[ultralight backpacking]] and [[mountaineering]] are sometimes frameless as well.

====Sports====
{{main|Hydration pack}}
Sports and hydration backpacks are smaller with a profile closer to the body, wider straps and can come with water bladders and hip belts for running, cycling or hiking. Running hydration packs are the smallest and lightest, many under 2 litres and most under six litres. Compression straps across the top of one's body are common as are hip belts. Cycling hydration packs are six to ten litres sitting high on the back. Although daypacks are small averaging ten to thirty litres, all Trekking and Hiking hydration packs are generally the largest and heaviest. Thirty five up to sixty five litres and above are common.

===External frame packs===
External frame packs were designed to carry heavy loads (&gt;20&amp;nbsp;kg or 40&amp;nbsp;lb), giving the wearer more support and protection and better weight distribution than a simple, frameless strapped bag. Wooden pack frames were used for centuries around the world. [[Ötzi the Iceman]] may have used one in [[Copper Age]] Alpine Italy,&lt;ref name=ItalyMuseum&gt;{{cite web |title=The Iceman at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology |url=http://www.archaeologiemuseum.it/en/the-iceman-at-the-museum|website=ArchaeologieMuseum.it |publisher=South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology |date=2013 |accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitiveways.com/pack_frame.html|title=The Three-Stick Roycroft Packframe|author=|date=|website=www.primitiveways.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some archaeologists believe the frame found with the body was part of a [[snowshoe]]. Such packs are common in [[military]] and [[mountaineering]] applications;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mtn.tpl.lib.wa.us/climbs/climbing/equipment/image_04.asp|title=Mountaineers|author=|date=|website=mtn.tpl.lib.wa.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; metal versions first appeared in the mid-20th century.

The external frame is typically made from aluminum, other lightweight metal alloy, and recently reinforced [[synthetic polymers]] or [[plastic]] and is equipped with a system of straps and tautly-stretched netting which prevents contact between the metal frame and user's back. In addition to comfort, this "stand-off" provides the additional benefit of creating air circulation between the frame and the wearer's back. For this reason, external frame packs are generally considered to be a "cooler load" than internal frame designs. External frame packs have a fabric "sack" portion which is usually smaller than that of internal frame packs, but have exposed frame portions above and below the sack to accommodate attachment of larger items. In addition, the sack can often be removed entirely, permitting the user to customize the configuration of their load, or to transport a non-conventional load such as a quartered game animal. Military packs are often external frame designs due to their ability to carry loads of different shapes, sizes and weights.

The other type of external frame which recently was proposed, is made from [[Composite material|composite]] [[plastic]] which is not flexible like current backpack straps and also it is a kind of material that can be shaped like human spine curvature. In this type of backpack, load directly transfers to the shoulders through the non-flexible straps. This non-flexible structure diminishes the momentum at lumbar region of the back. Strap curvature is shaped close to spine curvature and there are two flexible drawstrings to prevent backpack movement in transverse plane. The straps of this backpack are wide enough to distribute the pressure on shoulders and also a white glass wool layer is added to the internal part of them to absorb dynamic forces, which could be produced through walking. This backpack type is an experimental sample that need further options to be prepared for  usage. One of the benefits of backpack with external frame is preventing the spine to incline forward during walking that would be helpful in preventing damage of long term backpack carrying.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Internal frame packs===
The internal frame backpack is a recent innovation, invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, who went on to found [[Lowe Alpine]] and [[Lowepro]], companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lowepro.com/innovation |title=Innovations |publisher=Lowepro |access-date=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630142251/http://www.lowepro.com/innovation |archive-date=30 June 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An internal-frame pack has a large fabric section around an internal frame composed of strips of either aluminum, titanium or plastic, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. A complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The internal frame permits the pack to fit closely to the wearer's back and minimizes shifting of the load, which is desirable when participating in activities that involve upper-body movement such as scrambling over rocky surfaces and skiing. However, the tight fit reduces ventilation, so these type of packs tend to be more sweaty than external frame packs. The internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment; a few lash points (including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items) may be present, but as the frame is completely integrated, it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the pack. Internal frame packs originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking, but newer models have improved greatly in these respects. In addition, because of their snug fit, the improved internal frame models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities.

==Daily use==
{{See also|Schoolbags}}
[[File:Bag purchased from Johor Bahru.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Daypack]]
A daypack is a smaller, frameless backpack that can hold enough contents for a day hike, or a day's worth of other activities. They are not large enough for average [[Backpacking (wilderness)|wilderness backpacking]] that use full-sized [[sleeping bag]]s and backpacking tents, but may be large enough for [[ultralight backpacking]]. Padded or unpadded waist straps may be provided to distribute weight across the body.

[[File:School bag backpack.jpg|thumb|right|150px|School bag]]
In many countries, backpacks are heavily identified with [[student]]s, and are a primary means of transporting educational materials to and from school.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Horovitz, "New 'badge' of cool: High-tech, high-fashion backpacks," ''[[USA Today]]'', 20 August 2007, 1A.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context they are sometimes known as [[bookbag]]s or schoolbags. The purchase of a suitably fashionable, attractive, and useful backpack is a crucial back-to-school ritual for many students.&lt;ref name="Horovitz, 1A"&gt;Horovitz, 1A.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:低めリュック背負い (7391288036).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Loose Carrying&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tokyo-stories.com/2010/08/loose-backpack-carrying.html Loose Backpack Carrying « Tokyo Stories] August 18th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Typical school backpacks generally lack the rigid frame of an outdoor-style backpack and include only a few pockets in the front in addition to the main storage compartment. While traditionally very simple in design, school backpacks are often made with padded shoulder straps and backs as well as additional reinforcement to hold large numbers of heavy textbooks, as well as safety features such as reflective panels to make the wearer of the pack more visible at night.

Backpacks are sometimes worn as fashion accessories, in which they perform the same function as a purse.&lt;ref name="Horovitz, 1A"/&gt; Some such backpacks designed specifically for women are no larger than a typical purse, and are generally associated with younger women.

==Special-purpose backpacks==

Some backpacks are specifically designed to carry certain items. Common examples include backpacks for small valuable items such as [[laptop]]s and [[camera]]s;&lt;ref name="Horovitz, 1A"/&gt; backpacks designed to hold laptop computers in particular generally have a padded compartment to hold the computer and medium-sized pockets and flaps to accommodate accessories such as charger cables and mice. These are especially common in college and university settings. In order to supply these devices with electricity, a few high-end backpacks are equipped with solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Sun Inspired: How To Build A Solar Backpack | work = National Public Radio | author = John Kalish | accessdate = 10 May 2009 | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103230940| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090423025905/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103230940| archivedate= 23 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rolling backpacks are backpacks with wheels on the bottom and an extending handle. Because of their design, rolling backpacks reduce the strain on the user, though the shoulder straps may be used to carry the pack for short distances when the terrain is not suitable for wheels. Rolling backpacks are most commonly used while traveling by airplane or train.

[[Hydration backpack]]s  are also available. These light daypacks are especially designed to hold water in a special water bladder (also known as reservoir), and their purpose is to allow the carrier constant fluid hydration handsfree, so that the carrier can focus on the mission ahead without having to stop for water breaks.

==Professional use==
Backpacks are a standard part of the load-bearing equipment of soldiers, especially [[infantry]], in most countries, and military-style packs are regularly available to civilians in [[military surplus]] stores. Well-known examples include the United States [[All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment|ALICE field pack]] and the British Army [[Personal Load Carrying Equipment|PLCE]] rucksack attachment, both of which are widely available to civilian markets both as actual military surplus (new or used) and as replicas. Such packs are often, though not always (e.g. the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]]'s [[Improved Load Bearing Equipment|ILBE]] pack), external-frame packs, with the pack itself lashed or [[Circle cotter|pinned]] to a metal or plastic carrying frame. For units that are entering combat situations, packs may be loaded heavily and can weigh in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;lbs. Each soldier may carry extra weapons, ammunition, rations, medical supplies, tents or other shelter material, and extra clothing.

Many police tactical units, as well as players of military-style combat games such as paintball and airsoft, use these military-style tactical backpacks and webbing for storing gear and ammunition. There is also a small but thriving industry devoted to creating historical reproductions of military gear; such companies generally produce period-appropriate uniforms and other gear in addition to backpacks.

Some more recent military/tactical designs, especially the [[MOLLE]] and [[ILBE]] packs used by the United States armed forces, are covered with webbing loop attachment points for increased carrying capacity.

Recently, at least one brand of backpack has been specially designed for professional cooks and culinary students. This sort of backpack is meant to safely carry knives, cooking tools, and other miscellaneous equipment such as notebooks, towels, and uniforms.

Specialist backpacks are used by fire services for wildfire fighting, as well as by rescue services for Search and Rescue. These backpacks are generally very modular, allowing the pack to be reconfigured to the users wishes and are designed to load around the wearers hips. They may include features such as sections for water bladders and specially designed pouches, such as those used to carry personal fire shelters.

==Backpacks for travel==
{{Main|Backpacking (travel)}}

[[File:WJT2005 Luggage.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Luggage and backpacks]]
Backpacks are sometimes used as [[luggage]], particularly as carry-on bags for airplane travel.

In addition to their use in outdoors pursuits, backpacks are sometimes used in other sports as well. [[Hydration pack]]s, sometimes used by athletes and military personnel, carry water (in either a bladder or a rigid bottle) and have a tube connected to them from which the wearer can drink without removing the pack; this feature is also included in some more general-purpose hiking backpacks. Backpacks that carry [[skateboard]]s have also become more popular in the youth culture.

[[Image:Balisor-en-ligne.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Photograph showing Balisor beacons in use on high voltage cables]]

'''Balisor''' is a system of illuminated [[beacon]]s for [[high voltage#Power lines|high voltage power lines]] using a cold-cathode low-pressure [[neon lamp]],&lt;ref&gt;David F. Rider '' Jane's airport equipment fifth edition'', Jane's Pub. Co., 1986  page 92&lt;/ref&gt;  used as an [[aircraft warning light]].

==Description==
High voltage power cables, particularly those close to [[airport]]s, need to be visible day and night. During the day, brightly coloured balls positioned along the length of the cables are sufficient, but during the night, lighting is necessary. These beacons provide this lighting by glowing red, the standard colour used in aviation for warning beacons.

The system is extremely simple, efficient and reliable and is considered the most economically viable solution{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. Its working principle is attractive because it uses a phenomenon usually considered as a weakness. However a large disadvantage is that it does not work when the line is switched off. It cannot also be used on [[HVDC]] powerlines, but similar devices may be also used on [[mast radiator]]s.

==Operating principle==
The interest of the system lies in the way it obtains a power supply directly from the single cable on which it is mounted. It is difficult to obtain a very small amount of energy from a line which transports an enormous amount. 
[[Image:Balisor.svg|thumb|right|300px|System diagram]]
Each high voltage cable creates an electric field around itself, in the same way as any live [[electrical conductor]]. When the [[electric potential]] of such a cable is sufficiently high, its electric field causes a significant [[potential difference|voltage difference]] between the cable and its immediate neighbour. (It is the strength of the [[electric field]] that makes it difficult use low powers.)

As a result, a second [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] a few metres long, insulated from but parallel to the high voltage cable, will have a potential different from that of the main cable. Together the conductors make a [[capacitor]] charged across an air gap ([[dielectric]]).

Under certain conditions, the accumulated charge (and hence the potential difference) is sufficient to trigger a [[discharge lamp]]. This what is used in practice, giving a reliable and robust beacon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1374">'''Blobotics''' is a term describing research into chemical based computer processors based on [[ions]] rather than [[electrons]].  [[Andrew Adamatzky]], a computer scientist at the [[University of the West of England]] in [[Bristol]] used the term in an article in [[New Scientist]] March 28, 2005 [https://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/mg18524921.000-introducing-the-glooper-computer.html].  

The aim is to create 'liquid logic gates' which would be 'infinitely reconfigurable and self-healing'.  The process relies on the [[Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction]], a repeating cycle of three separate sets of reactions.  Such a processor could form the basis of a [[robot]] which, using artificial sensors, interact with its surroundings in a way which mimics living creatures. 

The coining of the term was featured by [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC radio]] in [[Australia]] [http://www.abc.net.au/newsradio/txt/s1363466.htm].

The net '''capacity factor''' is the [[unitless]] ratio of an actual electrical energy output over a given period of time to the maximum possible electrical energy output over that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/capacity-factor-net.html |website= [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|nrc.gov]] |title= Capacity factor (net) |accessdate= 2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity factor is defined for any electricity producing installation, such as a [[fuel]] consuming [[power plant]] or one using [[renewable energy]], such as wind or the sun. The average capacity factor can also be defined for any class of such installations, and can be used to compare different types of electricity production. 

The maximum possible energy output of a given installation assumes its continuous operation at full [[nameplate capacity]] over the relevant period. The actual energy output during that period and the capacity factor vary greatly depending on a range of factors. The capacity factor can never exceed the [[availability factor]], or [[uptime]] during the period. Uptime can be reduced due to, for example, reliability issues and maintenance, scheduled or unscheduled. Other factors include the design of the installation, its location, the type of electricity production and with it either the fuel being used or, for renewable energy, the local weather conditions. Additionally, the capacity factor can be subject to regulatory constraints and [[market forces]], potentially affecting both its fuel purchase and its electricity sale. 

The capacity factor is often computed over a timescale of a year, [[Method of averaging|averaging out]] most temporal fluctuations. However, it can be also computed for a month to gain insight into seasonal fluctuations. Alternatively, it be computed over the lifetime of the power source, both while operational and after decommissioning.

==Sample calculations==

===Nuclear power plant===
[[File:Worldwide Nuclear Power Capacity Factors.png|thumb|Worldwide Nuclear Power Capacity Factors]]

Nuclear power plants are at the high end of the range of capacity factors, ideally reduced only by the [[availability factor]], i.e. maintenance and refueling. The largest nuclear plant in the US, [[Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station]] has between its three reactors a nameplate capacity of 3,942&amp;nbsp;MW. In 2010 its annual generation was 31,200,000&amp;nbsp;MWh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.gov/nuclear/state/arizona/ |website= [[Energy Information Administration|eia.gov]] |title= Arizona Nuclear Profile 2010 |accessdate= 2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a capacity factor of:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{31,200,000\ \mbox{MW·h}}{(365\ \mbox{days}) \times (24\ \mbox{hours/day}) \times (3942\ \mbox{MW})}=0.904={90.4\%}&lt;/math&gt;

Each of Palo Verde’s three reactors is refueled every 18 months, with one refueling every spring and fall. In 2014, a refueling was completed in a record 28 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.aps.com/en/ourcompany/news/latestnews/Pages/palo-verde-unit-2-ranked-as-top-us-generator-for-2013.aspx |title= palo verde unit 2 ranked as top u.s. generator for 2013 |website= [[Arizona Public Service|aps.com]] |date= 2014-03-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150420141153/https://www.aps.com/en/ourcompany/news/latestnews/Pages/palo-verde-unit-2-ranked-as-top-us-generator-for-2013.aspx |archive-date= 2015-04-20 |accessdate= 2017-02-11 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to the 35 days of downtime that the 2010 capacity factor corresponds to.&lt;!-- 365 days * (1 - 0.904) = 35.0 days --&gt;

===Wind farm===
The Danish offshore wind farm [[Horns Rev 2]], the world's largest at its inauguration in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/09/denmark-inaugurates-worlds-largest-offshore-wind-farm-horns-rev-2.php
|accessdate=2011-04-21
|title=Denmark Inaugurates World's Largest Offshore Wind Farm - 209 MW Horns Rev 2
|first=Matthew |last= McDermott
}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a nameplate capacity of 209.3&amp;nbsp;MW.
{{Asof|January 2017}} it has produced 6416&amp;nbsp;GWh since its commissioning 7.3 years ago, i.e. an average annual production of 875&amp;nbsp;GWh/year&lt;!-- age with only 2 digits, so annual production rounded (to 25), with higher precision the sourced numbers do not match up perfectly --&gt; and a capacity factor of:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{875,000\ \mbox{MW·h}}{(365\ \mbox{days}) \times (24\ \mbox{hours/day}) \times (209.3\ \mbox{MW})}=0.477 = 47.7\%&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=HR2el&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.energynumbers.info/capacity-factors-at-danish-offshore-wind-farms |website= energynumbers.info |title= Capacity factors at Danish offshore wind farms |author= Andrew |date= 2017-01-26 |accessdate= 2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites with lower capacity factors may be deemed feasible for wind farms, for example the onshore 1&amp;nbsp;GW [[Fosen Vind]] which {{asof|2017|lc=yes}} is under construction in Norway has a projected capacity factor of 39%.

Certain onshore wind farms can reach capacity factors of over 60%, for example the 44 MW Eolo plant in Nicaragua had a net generation of 232.132 GWh in 2015, equivalent to a capacity factor of 60.2%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.cndc.org.ni/ftp2/descargar_ftp.php?dir=Comercial/Resumenes%20Anuales/2015//&amp;nombre=RESUMEN%20INYECCIONES%202015.zip
|accessdate=2016-07-29
|title=Centro Nacional de Despacho de Carga
}}&lt;/ref&gt; while U.S. annual capacity factors from 2013 through 2016 range from 32.2% to 34.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_6_07_b|title=EIA - Electricity Data|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the capacity factor of a wind turbine measures actual production relative to possible production, it is unrelated to [[Betz's law|Betz's coefficient]] of 16/27 &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; 59.3%, which limits production vs. energy available in the wind.

===Hydroelectric dam===
{{Asof|2017}} the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China is, with its nameplate capacity of 22,500&amp;nbsp;MW, the largest power generating station in the world by installed capacity. 
In 2015 it generated 87&amp;nbsp;TWh, for a capacity factor of:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{87,000,000\ \mbox{MW·h}}{(365\ \mbox{days}) \times (24\ \mbox{hours/day}) \times (22,500\ \mbox{MW})}=0.45 = 45\%&lt;/math&gt;

[[Hoover Dam]] has a nameplate capacity of 2080 MW&lt;ref name="hoover_dam_faq"&gt;{{Cite web
 |url          = http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/faqs/powerfaq.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an annual generation averaging 4.2&amp;nbsp;TW·h.&lt;ref name="hoover_dam_faq"/&gt; (The annual generation has varied between a high of 10.348&amp;nbsp;TW·h in 1984, and a low of 2.648&amp;nbsp;TW·h in 1956.&lt;ref name="hoover_dam_faq"/&gt;).
Taking the average figure for annual generation gives a capacity factor of:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4,200,000\ \mbox{MW·h}}{(365\ \mbox{days}) \times (24\ \mbox{hours/day}) \times (2,080\ \mbox{MW})}=0.23 = 23\%&lt;/math&gt;

===Photovoltaic power station===
At the low range of capacity factors is the [[photovoltaic power station]], which supplies power to the electricity grid from a large-scale [[photovoltaic system]] (PV system). 
An inherent limit to its capacity factor comes from its requirement of [[daylight]], preferably with a sun unobstructed by clouds, smoke or [[smog]], shade from trees and building structures. 
Since the amount of sunlight varies both with the time of the day and the seasons of the year, the capacity factor is typically computed on an annual basis. 
The amount of available sunlight is mostly determined by the [[latitude]] of the installation and the local cloud cover.
The actual production is also influenced by local factors such as dust and ambient temperature, which ideally should be low. As for any power station, the maximum possible power production is the nameplate capacity times the number of hours in a year, while the actual production is the amount of electricity delivered annually to the grid.

For example, [[Agua Caliente Solar Project]], located in [[Arizona]] near the 33rd [[Circle of latitude|parallel]] and awarded for its excellence in renewable energy has a nameplate capacity of 290&amp;nbsp;MW and an actual average annual production of 740&amp;nbsp;GWh/year.
Its capacity factor is thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{740,000\ \mbox{MW·h}}{(365\ \mbox{days}) \times (24\ \mbox{hours/day}) \times (290\ \mbox{MW})}= 0.291 = 29.1\%&lt;/math&gt;.

A significantly lower capacity factor is achieved by [[Lauingen Energy Park]] located in [[Bavaria]], near the 49th parallel. With a nameplate capacity of 25.7&amp;nbsp;MW and an actual average annual production of 26.98&amp;nbsp;GWh/year it has a capacity factor of 12.0%.

== Determinants of a plant capacity factor ==
There are several reasons why a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100%. These include technical constraints, such as availability of the plant, economic reasons, and availability of the energy resource.

A plant can be out of service or operating at reduced output for part of the time due to equipment failures or routine maintenance. 
This accounts for most of the unused capacity of [[base load power plant]]s. Base load plants have the lowest costs per unit of electricity because they are designed for maximum efficiency and are operated continuously at high output. 
[[Geothermal power|Geothermal plants]], [[nuclear power|nuclear plants]], [[fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired plants]] and [[bioenergy|bioenergy plants]] that burn solid material are almost always operated as base load plants.

A plant can also have its output curtailed or intentionally left idle because the electricity is not needed or because the price of electricity is too low to make production economical.
This accounts for most of the unused capacity of [[peaking power plant]]s and [[load following power plant]]s.
Peaking plants may operate for only a few hours per year or up to several hours per day.
Many other power plants operate only at certain times of the day or year because of variation in loads and electricity prices.
If a plant is only needed during the day, for example, even if it operates at full power output from 8 am to 8 pm every day (12 hours) all year long, it would only have a 50% capacity factor.
Due to low capacity factors, electricity from peaking power plants is relatively expensive because the limited generation have to cover the plant fixed costs.

A third reason is that a plant may not have the fuel available to operate all of the time. 
This can apply to fossil generating stations with restricted fuels supplies, but most notably applies to intermittent renewable resources.&lt;ref name=ieaCF2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Electric generator capacity factors vary widely across the world - Today in Energy - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|url=https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=22832|website=www.eia.gov|accessdate=13 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Solar PV and wind turbines have a capacity factor limited by the availability of their "fuel", sunshine and wind respectively.
A hydroelectricity plant may have a capacity factor lower than 100% due to scarcity of water, or its output may be regulated to match the current power need, conserving its stored water for later usage.

Other reasons that a power plant may not have a capacity factor of 100% include restrictions or limitations on air permits and limitations on transmission that force the plant to curtail output.

== Capacity factor of renewable energy ==
[[File:US EIA monthly capacity factors for renewables 2011-2013.png|framed|right|[[Energy Information Administration|US EIA]] monthly capacity factors for renewables, 2011-2013]]
For [[renewable energy]] sources such as [[solar power]], [[wind power]] and [[hydroelectricity]], the main reason for reduced capacity factor is generally the availability of the energy source. 
The plant may be capable of producing electricity, but its "fuel" ([[wind]], [[sunlight]] or [[water]]) may not be available. 
A hydroelectric plant's production may also be affected by requirements to keep the water level from getting too high or low and to provide water for [[fish]] downstream. 
However, solar, wind and hydroelectric plants do have high [[availability factor]]s, so when they have fuel available, they are almost always able to produce electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awea.org/faq/basicen.html How Does A Wind Turbine's Energy Production Differ from Its Power Production?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313142528/http://www.awea.org/faq/basicen.html |date=March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When hydroelectric plants have water available, they are also useful for load following, because of their high ''dispatchability''. A typical hydroelectric plant's operators can bring it from a stopped condition to full power in just a few minutes.

[[Wind farm]]s are variable, due to the natural variability of the wind. 
For a wind farm, the capacity factor is determined by the availability of wind, the swept area of the turbine and the size of the [[Electric generator|generator]]. 
Transmission line capacity and electricity demand also affect the capacity factor. 
Typical capacity factors of current wind farms are between 25 and 45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://cleantechnica.com/2015/08/04/wind-could-replace-coal-as-us-primary-generation-source-new-nrel-data-suggests |website= cleantechnica.com |title= Wind Could Replace Coal As US’ Primary Generation Source, New NREL Data Suggests |first= Clayton |last= Handleman |date= 2015-08-04 |accessdate= 2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom during the five year period from 2011 to 2015 the annual capacity factor for wind was over 30%.&lt;ref name="decc.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/stats/publications/dukes/5956-dukes-2012-chapter-6-renewable.pdf|title=Digest of United Kingdom energy statistics (DUKES) for 2012: chapter 6 - Renewable sources of energy|author=|date=|website=decc.gov.uk|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279547/DUKES_2013_Chapter_6.pdf|title=Digest of United Kingdom energy statistics (DUKES) for 2013: chapter 6 - Renewable sources of energy|author=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.gov.uk1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/337684/chapter_6.pdf|title=Digest of United Kingdom energy statistics (DUKES) for 2014: chapter 6 - Renewable sources of energy|author=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.gov.uk2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/547977/Chapter_6_web.pdf|title=Digest of United Kingdom energy statistics (DUKES) for 2016: chapter 6 - Renewable sources of energy|author=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Solar energy]] is variable because of the daily rotation of the earth, seasonal changes, and because of cloud cover. 
For example, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District observed a 15% capacity factor in 2005.&lt;ref name=Blees2008&gt;{{cite book |ref=Blees2008 | author=Tom Blees | title=Prescription for the Planet, | ISBN=1-4196-5582-5 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, according to the [[SolarPACES]] programme of the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA), solar power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands, such as [[Solar power in Spain|Spain]] or the [[Solar power plants in the Mojave Desert|south-western United States]],&lt;ref name=mangey/&gt; although in some locations solar PV does not reduce the need for generation of network upgrades given that air conditioner peak demand often occurs in the late afternoon or early evening when solar output is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel Watt [http://www.ergo.ee.unsw.edu.au/value%20of%20PV%20in%20summer%20peaks.pdf Value of PV in summer peaks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217093812/http://www.ergo.ee.unsw.edu.au/value%20of%20PV%20in%20summer%20peaks.pdf |date=February 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Government of South Australia (2007), p.13,14 [http://www.climatechange.sa.gov.au/uploads/pdf/Feed-in_Discussion_Paper_submissions_closed.pdf South Australia’s Feed-In Mechanism for Residential Small-Scale Solar Photovoltaic Installations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205013241/http://www.climatechange.sa.gov.au/uploads/pdf/Feed-in_Discussion_Paper_submissions_closed.pdf |date=December 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
SolarPACES states that by using thermal energy storage systems the operating periods of [[solar thermal power]] (CSP) stations can be extended to become dispatchable (load following).&lt;ref name=mangey&gt;Thomas R. Mancini and Michael Geyer (2006). [http://www.iea.org/impagr/cip/pdf/issue36SolarP.pdf Spain Pioneers Grid-Connected Solar-Tower Thermal Power] SolarPACES, OECD/ IEA, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geothermal]] has a higher capacity factor than many other power sources, and geothermal resources are generally available all the time.

==Capacity factors by energy source==

===United States===
According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), from 2013-2017 the capacity factors of utility-scale generators were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_6_07_a|title=Table 6.7.B.

[[File:Deoroller DB.jpg|thumb|upright|Roll-on deodorant Rexona "Degree" brand]]
A '''deodorant''' is a substance applied to the body to prevent [[body odor]] caused by the bacterial breakdown of [[perspiration]] in armpits, feet, and other areas of the body. A subgroup of deodorants, '''antiperspirants''', affect odor as well as prevent sweating by affecting [[sweat gland]]s. Antiperspirants are typically applied to the [[underarm]]s, while deodorants may also be used on feet and other areas in the form of [[body spray]]s.

In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] classifies and regulates most deodorants as [[Cosmetics ingredients|cosmetics]], but classifies antiperspirants as [[over-the-counter drug]]s.&lt;ref name="fda-cosmetics"/&gt;

The first commercial deodorant, [[Mum (deodorant)|Mum]], was introduced and patented in the late nineteenth century by an [[inventor]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], Edna Murphey.&lt;ref name="Joey Green"/&gt; The product was briefly withdrawn from the market in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Joey Green"/&gt; The modern formulation of the antiperspirant was [[patent]]ed by [[Jules Montenier]] on January 28, 1941.&lt;ref name="Jules Montenier"/&gt; This formulation was first found in "Stopette" deodorant spray, which ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called "the best-selling deodorant of the early 1950s".&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

There is a popular myth that deodorant use is linked to breast cancer, but so far no such causal link has been substantiated in research.&lt;ref name=sbm/&gt;&lt;ref name=namer/&gt;

== History ==

In 1888, the first commercial deodorant, [[Mum (deodorant)|Mum]], was developed and patented by a U.S. [[inventor]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], Edna Murphey.&lt;ref name="Joey Green"&gt;{{cite book |author=Joey Green |chapter=The Apothecary: Elixiers, Remedies, and Tonics |page=356 |title=Joey Green's Incredible Country Store: Potions, Notions and Elixirs of the Past--and How to Make Them Today |edition=1 |publisher=Rodale Books |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-57954-848-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small company was bought by [[Bristol-Myers]] in 1931 and in the late 1940s, Helen Barnett Diserens developed an underarm applicator based on the newly invented [[ball-point pen]].&lt;ref name="Digest2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Digest|first=Editors at Reader's|title=99 Cent Solutions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWsMCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT152|accessdate=June 11, 2015|date=June 2, 2015|publisher=Readers Digest|isbn=9781621452386|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Socol2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Socol|first=Garrett|title=Gathered Here Together|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dehXwl_hd5cC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=June 11, 2015|date=December 5, 2011|publisher=Ampersand Books|isbn=9780984102587|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the company began marketing the product under the name Ban Roll-On.&lt;ref name="Digest2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Socol2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|title=Advertising and Marketing News|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1957/10/06/91166674.html?pageNumber=182|accessdate=June 12, 2015|work=New York Times|date=January 25, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product was briefly withdrawn from the market in the U.S.,&lt;ref name="Joey Green"/&gt; but it is once again available at retailers in the U.S. under the brand Ban.&lt;ref name="Nashville Business Journal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nashville.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/1998/03/02/daily2.html |title=Chattem acquires Ban deodorant brand |publisher=Nashville Business Journal | date=March 2, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK it is sold under the names Mum Solid and Mum Pump Spray.&lt;ref name="Joey Green"/&gt; [[Chattem]] acquired Ban deodorant brand in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/24/business/company-news-chattem-acquiring-ban-brand-for-165-million.html |title=CHATTEM ACQUIRING BAN BRAND FOR $165 MILLION |work=The New York Times | date=February 24, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently sold it to [[Kao Corporation]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/25/business/company-news-chattem-agrees-to-sell-ban-deodorant-line-to-jergens.html |title=CHATTEM AGREES TO SELL BAN DEODORANT LINE TO JERGENS |work=The New York Times | date=August 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, the first commercial antiperspirant was Everdry.[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/How-Advertisers-Convinced-Americans-They-Smelled-Bad-164779646.html#ixzz2Z49wDhld] The modern formulation of the antiperspirant was patented by [[Jules Montenier]] on January 28, 1941.&lt;ref name="Jules Montenier"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2230084}}&lt;/ref&gt; This patent addressed the problem of the excessive acidity of aluminum chloride and its excessive irritation of the skin, by combining it with a soluble [[nitrile]] or a similar compound.&lt;ref name="Jules Montenier"/&gt; This formulation was first found in "Stopette" deodorant spray, which [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] called "the best-selling deodorant of the early 1950s".&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940327,00.html |title=Corporations: Scalping the Competition |work=Time magazine |date=July 12, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Stopette" gained its prominence as the first and long-time sponsor of the game show ''[[What's My Line?]]'', and was later eclipsed by many other brands as the 1941 patent expired.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Between 1942 and 1957 the market for deodorants increased 600 times to become a $70 million market. Deodorants were originally marketed primarily to women, but by 1957 the market had expanded to male users, and estimates were that 50% of men were using deodorants by that date. The Ban Roll-On product led the market in sales.&lt;ref name=nyt1957&gt;{{cite news|title=Newest Forms for Deodorants Spur Sales to the Male Market|last=Hammer|first=Alexander R.

In the early 1960s, the first [[Aerosol spray|aerosol]] antiperspirant in the marketplace was [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]]'s [[Right Guard]], whose brand was later sold to [[Henkel]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Right Guard |url=http://www.themediabriefing.com/companies/right-guard |work=BriefingMedia Ltd. |access-date=February 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411235640/http://www.themediabriefing.com/companies/right-guard |archive-date=April 11, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerosols were popular because they let the user dispense a spray without coming in contact with the underarm area. By the late 1960s, half of all the antiperspirants sold in the U.S. were aerosols, and continued to grow in all sales to 82% by the early 1970s. However, in the late 1970s two problems arose which greatly changed the popularity of these products. First, in 1977 the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] banned the active ingredient used in aerosols, aluminium zirconium chemicals, due to safety concerns over long term inhalation. Second, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] limited the use of [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC) propellants used in aerosols due to awareness that these gases can contribute to depleting the ozone layer. As the popularity of aerosols slowly decreased, stick antiperspirants became more popular.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== Overview ==
[[File:Stick deodorant.jpg|thumb|Stick antiperspirant/deodorant]]

Human perspiration is largely odorless until it is [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] by [[bacteria]] that thrive in hot, humid environments. The human underarm is among the most consistently warm areas on the surface of the human body, and [[sweat gland]]s provide moisture, which when excreted, has a vital cooling effect. When adult armpits are washed with [[alkaline]] pH soap, the skin loses its [[acid mantle]] (pH 4.5 - 6), raising the skin pH and disrupting the skin barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuehl BL, Fyfe KS, Shear NH |title=Cutaneous cleansers |journal=Skin Therapy Lett |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=1–4 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12858234}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many bacteria thrive in this elevated pH environment,&lt;ref name="Stenzaly-Achtert"/&gt; this makes the skin susceptible to bacterial colonization.&lt;ref name="Stenzaly-Achtert"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0846.2000.006002087.x |vauthors=Stenzaly-Achtert S, Schölermann A, Schreiber J, Diec KH, Rippke F, Bielfeldt S |title=Axillary pH and influence of deodorants |journal=Skin Res Technol |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87–91 |date=May 2000 |pmid=11428948}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bacteria feed on the sweat from the [[apocrine sweat gland|apocrine glands]] and on dead skin and hair cells, releasing [[trans-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid]] in their waste, which is the primary cause of body odor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1093/chemse/20.4.401 |author1=Pierce JD Jr |author2=Zeng XN |author3=Aronov EV |author4=Preti G |author5=Wysocki CJ |title=Cross-adaptation of sweaty-smelling 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid by a structurally similar, pleasant-smelling odorant |journal=Chem Senses |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=401–11 |date=August 1995 |pmid=8590025}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Underarm hair]] wicks the moisture away from the skin and aids in keeping the skin dry enough to prevent or diminish bacterial colonization. The hair is less susceptible to bacterial growth and therefore is ideal for preventing the bacterial odor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marc Paye |author2=Howard I.

=== Deodorant ===
In the United States, deodorants are classified and regulated as [[cosmetics]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)&lt;ref name="fda-cosmetics"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/CosmeticsQA/ucm136560.htm Cosmetics Q&amp;A: "Personal Care Products"]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; and are designed to eliminate odor. Deodorants are often [[alcohol]]-based. Alcohol initially stimulates sweating, but may also temporarily kill bacteria. Other active ingredients in deodorants include [[sodium stearate]], [[sodium chloride]] and [[stearyl alcohol]]. Deodorants can be formulated with other, more persistent [[antimicrobial]]s such as [[triclosan]] that slow bacterial growth or with metal [[chelant]] compounds such as [[EDTA]]. Deodorants may contain [[perfume]] fragrances or natural [[essential oil]]s intended to mask the odor of perspiration. In the past, deodorants included chemicals such as [[zinc oxide]], acids, [[ammonium chloride]], [[sodium bicarbonate]] and [[formaldehyde]], but some of these ingredients were messy, irritating to the skin or even [[carcinogenic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/90/i27/Deodorants-Antiperspirants.html|title=Deodorants &amp; Antiperspirants - July 2, 2012 Issue - Vol. 90 Issue 27 - Chemical &amp; Engineering News|first=Sarah|last=Everts|website=cen.acs.org|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over-the-counter products labeled as "natural deodorant crystal" containing the chemical [[potassium alum]], which contains aluminum, have gained new-found popularity as an alternative health product, in spite of concerns about possible contact dermatitis.&lt;ref name="Gallego"/&gt; A popular alternative to modern commercial deodorants is [[ammonium alum]], which is a common type of [[alum]], also containing aluminum, sold in crystal form and often referred to as a ''deodorant crystal''. It has been used as a deodorant throughout history in Thailand, the Far East, Mexico and other countries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Vaginal deodorant, in the form of sprays, [[suppository|suppositories]] and wipes, is often used by women to take away the smell of the [[vagina]]. Vaginal deodorants can sometimes cause [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpahealth.org.au/sex-matters/factsheets/61.html|title=FPA Health: Sex Matters: Factsheets: The Vagina - Common Vaginal Conditions|date=31 July 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228172305/http://www.fpahealth.org.au/sex-matters/factsheets/61.html|archivedate=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deodorant antiperspirant ===
[[File:BlueSand Picture.jpg|thumb|247x247px|Methenamine based antiperspirant for treatment of excessive sweating]]
In the United States, deodorants combined with antiperspirant agents are classified as [[drugs]] by the FDA.&lt;ref name="fda-cosmetics"/&gt; Antiperspirants attempt to stop or significantly reduce perspiration and thus reduce the moist climate in which bacteria thrive. [[Aluminium chloride]], [[aluminium chlorohydrate]], and [[aluminium]]-[[zirconium]] compounds, most notably [[aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly]] and [[aluminium zirconium trichlorohydrex gly]], are frequently used in antiperspirants. Aluminium chlorohydrate and aluminium-zirconium tetrachlorohydrate gly are the most frequent active ingredients in commercial antiperspirants.&lt;ref name="Lukacs"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lukacs VA, Korting HC |title=Antitranspirantien und Deodorantien&amp;nbsp;– Wirkstoffe und Bewertung |trans-title=Antiperspirants and deodorants – ingredients and evaluation |language=German |journal=Dermatosen in Beruf und Umwelt |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=53–57 |year=1989 |pmid=2656175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium-based complexes react with the [[electrolyte]]s in the sweat to form a gel plug in the duct of the sweat gland. The plugs prevent the gland from excreting liquid and are removed over time by the natural [[Desquamation|sloughing]] of the skin. The metal salts work in another way to prevent sweat from reaching the surface of the skin: the  aluminium salts interact with the keratin fibrils in the sweat ducts and form a physical plug that prevents sweat from reaching the skin’s surface. Aluminium salts also have a slight [[astringent]] effect on the pores; causing them to contract, further preventing sweat from reaching the surface of the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Draelos ZD |title=Antiperspirants and the hyperhidrosis patient |journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=220–224 |date=September 2001 |doi=10.1046/j.1529-8019.2001.01028.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blockage of a large number of sweat glands reduces the amount of sweat produced in the underarms, though this may vary from person to person. [[Hexamethylenetetramine|Methenamine]] in the form of cream and spray is successfully used for treatment of excessive sweating and related to it odour. Antiperspirants are usually better applied before bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/28/antiperspirant-mistake_n_5701736.html|title=The Common Mistake People Make When Applying Antiperspirant (VIDEO)|first=Lynn|last=Okura|date=August 28, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=April 3, 2018|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Form ===
Deodorants and antiperspirants come in many forms. What is commonly used varies in different countries. In Europe, [[aerosol spray]]s are popular, as are cream and roll-on forms. In North America, solid or gel forms are dominant.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Health effects ==
After using a deodorant containing zirconium, the skin may develop an [[allergic]], axillary [[granuloma]] response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kleinhans D, Knoth W |title=[Granulomas of axillae (zirconium?) (author's transl)] |journal=Dermatologica |volume=152 |issue=3 |pages=161–7 |date=July 1976 |pmid=939343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antiperspirants with [[propylene glycol]], when applied to the axillae, can cause irritation and may promote sensitization to other ingredients in the antiperspirant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Agren-Jonsson S, Magnusson B |title=Sensitization to propantheline bromide, trichlorocarbanilide and propylene glycol in an antiperspirant |journal=Contact Dermatitis |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=79–80 |year=1976 |pmid=1017183 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0536.1976.tb02989.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deodorant crystals containing synthetically made [[potassium alum]] were found to be a weak [[Irritation|irritant]] to the skin.&lt;ref name="Gallego"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gallego H, Lewis EJ, Crutchfield CE 3rd |title=Crystal deodorant dermatitis: irritant dermatitis to alum-containing deodorant |journal=Cutis |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=65–6 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10431678}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unscented deodorant is available for those with sensitive skin.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Frequent use of deodorants was associated with blood concentrations of the [[synthetic musk]] [[galaxolide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutter HP, Wallner P, Hartl W, Uhl M, Lorbeer G, Gminski R, Mersch-Sundermann V, Kundi M |title=Higher blood concentrations of synthetic musks in women above fifty years than in younger women |journal=Int J Hyg Environ Health |volume=213 |issue=2 |pages=124–30 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20056483 |doi=10.1016/j.ijheh.2009.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aluminum toxicity ===
[[File:L+S deo.jpg|thumb|An aluminum-free deodorant. Deodorants without aluminum are sometimes recommended for patients with breast cancer or undergoing chemotherapy.]]
[[Aluminum]] is present most often in antiperspirants in the form of [[aluminum chlorohydrate]].&lt;ref name="Lukacs"/&gt; Aluminum chlorohydrate is not the same as the compound [[aluminum chloride]], which has been established as a [[neurotoxin]].&lt;ref name="Lankoff"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=He BP, Strong MJ |title=A morphological analysis of the motor neuron degeneration and microglial reaction in acute and chronic in vivo aluminum chloride neurotoxicity |journal=J.

The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]], in a monograph dedicated to analysing the safety of deodorants, concluded that "despite many investigators looking at this issue, the agency does not find data from topical and inhalation chronic exposure animal and human studies submitted to date sufficient to change the monograph status of aluminum containing antiperspirants", therefore allowing their use and vowing to keep monitoring the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="FDA Register Vol 68 No 110"/&gt; Members of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (Europe) concluded that "due to the lack of adequate data on dermal penetration to estimate the internal dose of aluminium following cosmetic uses, risk assessment cannot be performed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety |title=OPINION ON the safety of aluminium in cosmetic products|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_153.pdf|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breast cancer ===
The myth that breast cancer is believed to be linked with deodorant use has been widely circulated, and appears to originate from a [[Spamming|spam]] email sent in 1999;&lt;ref name=sbm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/cutting-the-other-breast-off-does-not-improve-breast-cancer-survival/ |title=Breast cancer myths: No, antiperspirants do not cause breast cancer |work=Science-Based Medicine |author=Gorski D |authorlink=David Gorski |date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is no evidence to support the existence of such a link.&lt;ref name=namer&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Namer M, Luporsi E, Gligorov J, Lokiec F, Spielmann M |title=[The use of deodorants/antiperspirants does not constitute a risk factor for breast cancer] |language=French |journal=Bull Cancer |volume=95 |issue=9 |pages=871–80 |date=September 2008  |pmid=18829420 |doi=10.1684/bdc.2008.0679 |type=Comprehensive literature review|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One constituent of deodorant products which has given cause for concern are [[paraben]]s, a chemical additive.&lt;ref name=paraben/&gt; According to the [[American Cancer Society]] "studies have not shown any direct link between parabens and any health problems, including breast cancer".&lt;ref name=paraben&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/antiperspirants-and-breast-cancer-risk.html |title=Antiperspirants and Breast Cancer Risk |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kidney dysfunction ===
The FDA has "acknowledge[d] that small amounts of aluminium can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and through the skin.", leading to a warning "that people with [[renal failure|kidney disease]] may not be aware that the daily use of antiperspirant drug products containing aluminium may put them at a higher risk because of exposure to aluminium in the product."&lt;ref name="FDA Register Vol 68 No 110"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/developmentresources/over-the-counterotcdrugs/statusofotcrulemakings/ucm110774.pdf |title=Antiperspirant Drug Products For Over-the-Counter Human Use; Final Monograph | publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency warns people with kidney dysfunction to consult a [[Physician|doctor]] before using antiperspirants containing aluminum.&lt;ref name="FDA Register Vol 68 No 110"/&gt;

'''Design methods''' are procedures, techniques, aids, or tools for designing. They offer a number of different kinds of activities that the designer might use within an overall design process. Conventional procedures of design, such as drawing, can be regarded as design methods, but since the 1950s new procedures have been developed that are more usually grouped together under the name of 'Design Methods’. What these new methods have in common is that they "are attempts to make public the hitherto private thinking of designers; to externalise the design process".&lt;ref name="Jones Design Methods"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=J. Christopher |title=Design Methods |date=1980 |publisher=Wiley |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Design methodology'' is the broader study of method in design: the study of the principles, practices and procedures of designing.&lt;ref name="Cross Methodology"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cross |first1=Nigel |title=Developments in Design Methodology |date=1984 |publisher=Wiley |location=UK |isbn=0471102482}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Background==
Social, political and economic developments of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century put into motion modern benefits and constraints for living and working. Industrial and technological breakthroughs associated with this period created social and economic complexities for people and their environment. Disciplines such as architecture, urban planning, engineering and product development began to tackle new types of problem-solving past traditional artifact making. More informed and methodical approaches to designing were required.

From 1958 to 1963 [[Horst Rittel]] was a pioneer in articulating the relationship between science and design, specifically the limitations of design processes based on the 19th century rational view of science, in his courses at [[Ulm School of Design]] in Germany (Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm: 1953–1968).&lt;ref name=Ulm1&gt;[http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/ ''Ulm School of Design | HfG Ulm Archive'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ulm2&gt;Lindinger, H., (1991), ''Ulm Design: The Morality of Objects'', Cambridge: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Rittel proposed principles for dealing with these limitations through his seminal HfG design methods courses: [[cybernetics]], [[operational analysis]] and [[communication theory]].&lt;ref name=Ulm1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ulm2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rit1&gt;Rith, C and Dubberly, H, 'Why Horst W J Rittel Matters', Design Issues, Vol 23, No 1, pp. 72-91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 he was recruited to Berkeley to teach design methods courses and helped found the Design Methods Group (DMG) and the DMG Journal.&lt;ref name=Rit1 /&gt;

Design methods in England originally drew from a 1962 conference&lt;ref&gt;John Christopher Jones and Denis Thornley (eds). The Conference on Design Methods: papers presented at the conference on systematic and intuitive methods in engineering, industrial design, architecture and communications, London, September 1962, Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; called "The Conference on Systematic and Intuitive Methods in Engineering, Industrial Design, Architecture and [[Communication studies|Communications]]." This event was organized by [[John Christopher Jones|John Chris Jones]], and Peter Slann who, with conference invitees, were driven by concerns about how their modern industrialized world was being manifested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/dmconference1962.html 1962 conference participants]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conference participants countered the craftsman model of design which was rooted in turning raw materials through tried and true craft-based knowledge into finished products. They believed that a single craft-based designer producing design solutions was not compatible with addressing the evolving complexity of post-industrial societies. They stressed that designers needed to work in cross-disciplinary teams where each participant brings his/her specific body of skills, language and experiences to defining and solving problems in whatever context.

The &lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/theory_of_designing.html John Chris Jones lists key design questions]&lt;/ref&gt; key benefit was to find a method that suits a particular design situation. [[Christopher Alexander]] went on to write his seminal books ''[[A Pattern Language]]'' and ''[[A Timeless Way of Building]]''.

=== Emergence of design research and design studies ===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, graduates of the [[Ulm School of Design]] in Germany (Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm: 1953–1968).&lt;ref name="Ulm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ulm2"/&gt; began to spread Horst Rittel's approach of design methodology across Europe and the United States in context of their professional work and teaching what became known as the 'Ulm Model'.&lt;ref name=Ulm2 /&gt;

Likewise, after the 1962 conference in England, many of the participants began to publish and to define an area of research that focused on design. Three "camps" seemed to emerge to develop different directions in the initial work in Design Methods:

:* Behaviorism interpreted Design Methods as a way to describe [[human behavior]] in relation to the built environment. Its clinical approach tended to rely on human behavior processes ([[Categorization|taxonomic]] activities).
:* Reductivism broke Design Methods down into small constituent parts. This scientific approach tended to rely on rationalism and objectified processes such as [[epistemological]] activities.
:* Phenomenology approached design methods from an experiential approach (human experience and [[perception]].)

The [[Design Research Society]] was founded in 1966 by several participants from the Conference on Design Methods. The purpose of the Society is  to promote "the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields" and is an interdisciplinary group with many professions represented, but all bound by the conviction of the benefits of [[design research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/early_days1.0.html John Chris Jones thoughts on design research]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Environmental Design Research Association]] is one of the best-known entities that strive to integrate designers and [[social science]] professionals for better built environments. EDRA was founded by Henry Sanoff in 1969. Both [[John Chris Jones]] and [[Christopher Alexander]] interacted with EDRA and other camps; both seemed at a certain point to reject their interpretations. Jones and Alexander also questioned their original theses about design methods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

An interesting shift that affected design methods and design studies was a series of 1968 lectures by [[Herbert A. Simon]], the Nobel laureate, on "The Sciences of the Artificial".&lt;ref&gt;Simon, H. A. (1969) ''The Sciences of the Artificial'', MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed using [[scientific methods]] to explore the world of man-made things (hence artificial). He discussed the role of [[wiktionary:analysis|analysis]] ([[observation]]) and [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] (making) as a process of creating man-made responses to the world he/she interacted with. Important to Simon's contribution were his notions of "[[bounded rationality]]" and "[[satisficing]]." Simon's concept had a profound impact on the discourse in both design methods, and the newly emerging design studies communities in two ways. It provided an entry to using scientific ideas to overlay on design, and it also created an internal debate whether design could/should be expressed and practiced as a type of [[science]] with the reduction of emphasis on [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].

[[Nigel Cross]] has been prolific in articulating the issues of design methods and design research. The discussion of the ongoing debate of what is design research and design science was, and continues to be articulated by Cross. His thesis is that design is not a science, but is an area that is searching for "intellectual independence." He views the original design methods discussions of the 1960s as a way to integrate objective and rational methods in practicing design. Scientific method was borrowed as one framework, and the term [[design science]] was coined in 1966 at the conference on The Design Method focusing on a systematic approach to practicing design.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, S. A (1966), Design Science. In S. A Gregory (ed.) The Design Method. London, Butterworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Cross defined the "science of design" as a way to create a body of work to improve the understanding of design methods&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (1993) 'A History of Design Methodology', in M. de Vries, N. Cross and D. Grant (eds.), ''Design Methodology and Relationships with Science'', Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt; — and more importantly that design does not need to be a binary choice between [[science]] and [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (1982) 'Designerly Ways of Knowing', ''Design Studies'', '''3''', 221-227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigan Bayazit published an overview of the historical development of design methods. She stated that "Design methods people were looking at rational methods of incorporating scientific techniques and knowledge into the design process to make rational decisions to adapt to the prevailing values, something that was not always easy to achieve."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/074793604772933739 Bayazit, Nigan. "Investigating Design: A Review of Forty Years of Design Research."] Design Issues: Vol 20, No 1. Winter 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional design practice===
Conversations about design methods and a more systematic approach to design was not isolated to Europe. America was also a magnet for practicing design professionals to codify their successes in design practice and backing into larger theories about the dynamics of design methods.

American designers were much more pragmatic at articulating design methods and creating an underlying language about the practice of industrial and graphic design. They were tied to economic systems that supported design practice and therefore focused on the way design could be managed as an extension of business, rather than the European approach to design methods based on transforming engineering by design.

Industrial design was the first area that made inroads into systematizing [[knowledge]] through practice. [[Raymond Loewy]] was instrumental at elevating the visibility of industrial design through cult of personality (appearing three times on front cover of ''Time Magazine''). [[Henry Dreyfuss]] had a profound impact on the practice of industrial design by developing a systematic process used to shape environments, [[transportation]], [[Product (business)|products]] and [[packaging]]. His focus on the needs of the average consumer was most celebrated in his book ''Designing for People'', an extensive exploration of [[ergonomics]].

[[Jay Doblin]] one of America's foremost industrial designers, worked for Raymond Loewy and was later an employee of [[Unimark International]], the world’s largest global design firm during the 1960s with offices in seven countries. In 1972, Doblin formed Chicago-based Jay Doblin &amp; Associates, a firm which managed innovative programs for Xerox Corporation and General Electric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm?contentalias=JayDoblin AIGA Overview of Jay Doblin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103135028/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm?contentalias=JayDoblin |date=2005-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doblin was prolific at developing a language to describe design. One of his best articles was "A Short, Grandiose Theory of Design", published in the 1987 Society of Typographic Arts Design Journal. In seven pages, Doblin presents a straightforward and persuasive argument for design as a systematic process. He described the emerging landscape of systematic design:

:* For large complex projects, it "would be irresponsible to attempt them without analytical methods" and rallied against an "adolescent reliance on overly intuitive practices."
:* He separated "direct design" in which a craftsperson works on the artifact to "indirect design" in which a design first creates a representation of the artifact, separating design from production in more complex situations.

Doblin and others were responding to the increased [[Inheritance (computer science)|specialization]] of design and the complexity of managing large design programs for corporations. It was a natural process to begin to discuss how design should move upstream to be involved with the specifications of problems, not only in the traditional mode of production which design had been practiced. Particularly since 2000, design methods and its intersection with business development have been visibly championed by numerous consultancies within design industry.

The continuity of approaches to design projects by such representative firms is the generation of inputs incited by the human condition in varied contexts. These approaches utilize a sustainable methods-based mode of making that takes into account critical analytic and [[Synthetic proposition|synthetic]] skills toward more informed and inspired specifications grounded in:

:* Direct investigation of human circumstances to draw out impressions
:* Engagement by client-side and end-user participants in design process
:* Open articulation by practitioners of multiple disciplines facilitated by design

====Significance of role of professional design practice====
Practitioners approached design methods from a different angle than John Christopher Jones and the group of engineers and designers who convened in 1962. Many practitioners, through actual design opportunities, began to confront the complexities of the market and clients. They began to address issues of specifications, [[wiktionary:user|users]], distribution and [[innovation]]. Since there were no established methods, each practitioner began to develop frameworks and languages to describe a new way to design. Like any market-based model, there were many competing ideas about these new methods and their basis. Many of these designers may have been aware of the design methods movement, but many were not. Yet all their ideas were aligned to many of the basic tenets of the 1962 conference which advocated a more rigorous way of doing design. However, the social perspectives and criticisms of mediocre products of 1962 participants may not have been shared or agreed with.

==Current state of design methods==
There is no one way to practice design methods. John Chris Jones recognized this by stating:

:"Methodology should not be a fixed track to a fixed destination, but a conversation about everything that could be made to happen. The language of the conversation must bridge the logical gap between past and future, but in doing so it should not limit the variety of possible futures that are discussed nor should it force the choice  of a future that is unfree."&lt;ref name="Jones Design Methods"/&gt;

The focus of most post-1962 enhancements to design methods has been on developing a series of relevant, sound, humanistic problem-solving procedures and techniques to reduce avoidable errors and oversights that can adversely affect design solutions. The key benefit is to find a method that suits a particular design situation.

The benefits of their original work has been abstracted many times over; but in today's design environment, several of their main ideas have been integrated into contemporary design methods:
:* Emphasis on the user
:* Use of basic research methods to validate convictions with fact
:* Use of [[brainstorming]] and other related means to break mental patterns and precedent
:* Increased [[collaboration|collaborative]] nature of design with other disciplines

A large challenge for design as a discipline, its use of methods and an endeavor to create shared values, is its inherent synthetic nature as an area of study and action. This allows design to be extremely malleable in nature, borrowing ideas and concepts from a wide variety of professions to  suit the ends of individual practitioners. It also makes design vulnerable since these very activities make design a discipline unextensible as a shared body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/designmethodsforeveryone.html John Chris Jones perspective about "Design Methods for Everyone"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Donald Schon]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], published ''The Reflective Practitioner''.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, Donald A. The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action.  1983. Basic Books. {{ISBN|0-465-06878-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw traditional professions with stable knowledge bases, such as [[law]] and [[medicine]], becoming unstable due to outdated notions of 'technical-rationality' as the grounding of professional knowledge. Practitioners were able to describe how they 'think on their feet', and how they make use of a standard set of frameworks and techniques. Schon foresaw the increasing instability of traditional knowledge and how to achieve it. This is in line with the original founders of design methods who wanted to break with an unimaginative and static technical society and unify [[exploration]], [[collaboration]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].

Design methods has influenced design practice and [[design education]]. It has benefited the design community by helping to create introductions that would never have happened if traditional professions remained ''stable'', which did not necessarily allow collaboration due to gate keeping of areas of knowledge and [[expertise]]. Design has been by nature an interloper activity, with individuals that have crossed disciplines to question and innovate.

The challenge is to transform individual [[experiences]], frameworks and [[perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]] into a shared, understandable, and, most importantly, a transmittable area of knowledge. Victor Margolin {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} states three reasons why this will prove difficult:

:* Domain knowledge is a mixture of [[vocation]] (discipline) and avocation (interest) creating hybrid definitions that degrade shared knowledge
:* [[Intellectual capital]] of design and wider scholarly pluralism has diluted focus and shared language which has led to ungovernable [[laissez-faire]] values
:* Individual explorations of design discourse focuses too much on individual narratives leading to personal point of view rather than a critical mass of shared values

In the end, ''design methods'' is a term that is widely used. Though conducive to interpretations, it is a shared belief in an exploratory and rigorous method to solve problems through design, an act which is part and parcel of what designers aim to accomplish in today's complex world.

'''Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC''' ('''DCI''') is a joint venture of major motion picture studios, formed to establish a standard [[systems architecture|architecture]] for [[digital cinema]] systems.

The organization was formed in March 2002 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]],{{Efn | [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] withdrew as a member of DCI in May 2005, prior to the release of the DCI Specification.}} [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Universal Studios]], [[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[Warner Bros.]]

The primary purpose of DCI is to establish and document specifications for an [[open architecture]] for digital cinema that ensures a uniform and high level of technical performance, reliability and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = DCI | type = home page | url = http://www.dcimovies.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By establishing a common set of content requirements, [[film distributor|distributors]], [[production company|studios]], [[movie theater|exhibitors]], d-cinema manufacturers and vendors can be assured of interoperability and compatibility. Because of the relationship of DCI to many of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s key studios, conformance to DCI's specifications is considered a requirement by [[software developers]] or equipment manufacturers targeting the digital cinema market.

==Specification==
On July 20, 2005, DCI released Version 1.0 of its "Digital Cinema System Specification", commonly referred to as the "DCI Specification". The document describes overall system requirements and specifications for digital cinema. Between March 28, 2006, and March 21, 2007, DCI issued 148 errata to Version 1.0.

DCI released Version 1.1 of the DCI Specification on April 12, 2007, incorporating the previous 148 errata into the DCI Specification. On April 15, 2007, at the annual NAB Digital Cinema Summit, DCI announced the new version, as well as some future plans. They released a "Stereoscopic Digital Cinema Addendum"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Stereoscopic DC | type = addendum | publisher = DCI | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url = http://www.dcimovies.com/DCI_Stereoscopic_DC_Addendum.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to begin to establish 3-D technical specifications in response to the popularity of [[3-D film|3-D stereoscopic films]]. It was also announced "which studios would take over the leadership roles in DCI after the current leadership term expires at the end of September."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2007/digital/markets-festivals/dci-announces-digital-3-d-specs-1117963138/|title=DCI announces digital, 3-D specs|last=Cohen|first=David S|date=2007-04-15|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-10|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, between August 27, 2007, and February 1, 2008, DCI issued 100 errata to Version 1.1. So, DCI released Version 1.2 of the DCI Specification on March 7, 2008, again incorporating the previous 100 errata into the specification document. An additional 96 errata were issued by August 30, 2012, so a revised Version 1.2 incorporating those additional errata was approved on October 10, 2012. DCI approved DCI Specification Version 1.3 on June 27, 2018, integrating the 45 errata issued to the previous version into a new document. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = DCSS Version 1.3 | date = 2018-06-27 | publisher = DCI | url = http://dcimovies.com/specification/DCI_DCSS_Ver1-3_2018-0627.pdf | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous versions are also archived on the DCI web site.

Based on many [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]] and [[International Standards Organization|ISO]] standards, such as [[JPEG 2000]]-compressed image and "broadcast wave" [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]]/[[WAV]] sound, it explains the route to create an entire [[Digital Cinema Package]] (DCP) from a raw collection of files known as the Digital Cinema Distribution Master (DCDM), as well as the specifics of its content protection, [[encryption]], and [[forensic identification|forensic marking]].

The specification also establishes standards for the decoder requirements and the presentation environment itself, such as ambient light levels, [[pixel]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect]] and shape, image [[luminance]], [[white point]] [[chromaticity]], and those [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerances]] to be kept.

Even though it specifies what kind of information is required, the DCI Specification does not include specific information about how data within a distribution package is to be formatted. Formatting of this information is defined by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) digital cinema standards and related documents.{{Efn | As of 1 January 2018, the following fifty-six SMPTE engineering guidelines, recommended practices, registered disclosure documents and standards had been adopted and published:  • EG 432-1 Digital Source Processing - Color Processing for D-Cinema • EG 432-2 Digital Source Processing - D-Cinema Low Frequency Effects (LFE) Channel Audio Characteristics • RDD 20 Cinelink 2 Specification • RP 200 Relative and Absolute Sound Pressure Levels for Motion-Picture Multichannel Sound Systems - Applicable for Analog Photographic Film Audio, Digital Photographic Film Audio and D-Cinema • RP 428-4 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Audio File Format and Delivery Constraints • RP 428-5 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Mapping of Images into Constrained Tag Image File • RP 428-6 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Digital Leader • RP 431-2 D-Cinema Quality - Reference Projector and Environment • ST 336 Data Encoding Protocol Using Key-Length-Value • ST 337-1 Material Exchange Format (MXF) - File Format Specification • ST 377-4 MXF Multichannel Audio Labeling Framework • ST 379-1 Material Exchange Format (MXF) - MXF Generic Container • ST 379-2 For Television - Material Exchange Format (MXF) - MXF Constrained Generic Container • ST 382 Material Exchange Format - Mapping AES3 and Broadcast Wave Audio into the MXF Generic Container • ST 390 Material Exchange Format (MXF) - Specialized Operational Pattern ''OP-Atom'' (Simplified Representation of a Single Item) • ST 400 SMPTE Labels Structure • ST 410 Material Exchange Format - Generic Stream Partition • ST 422 Material Exchange Format - Mapping JPEG 2000 Codestreams into the MXF Generic Container • ST 427 Link Encryption for 1.5 Gb/s Serial Digital Interface • ST 428-1 D-Cinema Distribution Master (DCDM) - Image Characteristics • ST 428-2 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Audio Characteristics • ST 428-7 Digital Cinema Distribution Master - Subtitle • ST 428-9 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Image Pixel Structure Level 3 - Serial Digital Interface Signal Formatting • ST 428-10 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Closed Caption and Closed Subtitle • ST 428-11 Additional Frame Rates for D-Cinema • ST 428-12 D-Cinema Distribution Master Common Audio Channels and Soundfield Groups • ST 428-19 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Additional Frame Rates Level AFR2 and Level AFR4 - Serial Digital Interface Signal Formatting • ST 428-21 Archive Frame Rates for D-Cinema • ST 429-2 D-Cinema Packaging - DCP Operational Constraints • ST 429-3 D-Cinema Packaging - Sound and Picture Track File • ST 429-4 D-Cinema Packaging - MXF JPEG 2000 Application • ST 429-5 D-Cinema Packaging - Timed Text Track File • ST 429-6 D-Cinema Packaging - MXF Track File Essence Encryption • ST 429-7 D-Cinema Packaging - Composition Playlist • ST 429-8 D-Cinema Packaging - Packing List • ST 429-9 D-Cinema Packaging - Asset Mapping and File Segmentation • ST 429-10 D-Cinema Packaging - Stereoscopic Picture Track File • ST 429-12 D-Cinema Packaging - Caption and Closed Subtitle • ST 429-13 D-Cinema Packaging - DCP Operational Constraints for Additional Frame Rates • ST 429-14 D-Cinema Packaging - Aux Data Track File • ST 429-16 Additional Composition Metadata and Guidelines • ST 430-1 D-Cinema Operations - Key Delivery Message • ST 430-2 D-Cinema Operations - Digital Certificate • ST 430-3 D-Cinema Operations - Generic Extra-Theater Message Format • ST 430-4 D-Cinema Operations - Log Record Format Specification • ST 430-5 D-Cinema Packaging - Security Log Event Class and Constraints • ST 430-6 D-Cinema Operations - Auditorium Security Messages for Intra-Theater Communications • ST 430-9 D-Cinema Operations - Key Delivery Bundle • ST 430-10 D-Cinema Operations - Auxiliary Content Synchronization Protocol • ST 430-11 D-Cinema Operations - Auxiliary Resource Presentation List • ST 430-12 D-Cinema Operations - FSK Synchronization Signal • ST 430-14 D-Cinema Operations - Digital Sync Signal and Aux Data Transfer Protocol • ST 430-15 D-Cinema Operations - Facility List Message Exchange Protocol • ST 430-16 D-Cinema Operations - Extended Facility List Message • ST 431-1 D-Cinema Quality - Screen Luminance Level, Chromaticity and Uniformity • ST 433 D-Cinema - XML Data Types}}

The maximum compressed bit rate for support of all proposed frame rates should be 500 Mbit/s.

==Related information==
The idea for DCI was originally mooted in late 1999 by [[Tom McGrath (media executive)|Tom McGrath]], then COO of [[Paramount Pictures]], who applied to the U.S. Department of Justice for anti-trust waivers to allow the joint cooperation of all seven major motion picture studios.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[Universal Pictures]] made one of the first feature-length DCPs created to DCI specifications, using their film ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = DCinemaToday | url = http://www.dcinematoday.com/dc/pr.aspx?newsID=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was not distributed theatrically, it had one public screening on November 7, 2005, at the USC Entertainment Technology Center's Digital Cinema Laboratory in the Pacific Theatre, Hollywood. ''[[Inside Man]]'' was Universal's first DCP commercial release, and, in addition to 35mm film distribution, was delivered via hard drive to 20 theatres in the [[United States]] along with two [[trailer (film)|trailers]].

The Academy Film Archive houses the Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC Collection, which includes film and digital elements from DCI’s Standard Evaluation Material (StEM), a 12-minute production shot on 35mm and 65mm film, created for vendors and standards organizations to test and evaluate image compression and digital projection technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC Collection|url=http://www.oscars.org/film-archive/collections/digital-cinema-initiatives-llc|website=Academy Film Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital distribution''' (also referred to as  '''content delivery''', '''online distribution''', or '''electronic software distribution''' ('''ESD'''), among others) is the delivery or distribution of [[digital media]] [[content (media)|content]] such as [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]], [[motion graphics|video]], [[software]] and [[video game]]s.&lt;ref name=DDLL&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Distribution Law &amp; Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/d/digital-distribution/|work=Legal Definitions|publisher=USLegal|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is generally used to describe distribution over an online delivery medium, such as the [[Internet]], thus bypassing physical distribution methods, such as [[paper]], [[optical disc]]s, and [[VHS]] videocassettes. The term online distribution is typically applied to freestanding products; downloadable add-ons for other products are more commonly known as [[downloadable content]]. With the advancement of network bandwidth capabilities, online distribution became prominent in the 21st century.

Content distributed online may be streamed or downloaded, and often consists of [[book]]s, [[film]]s and [[television program]]s, [[music]], [[software]], and [[video game]]s. [[Streaming media|Streaming]] involves downloading and using content at a user's request, or "on-demand", rather than allowing a user to store it permanently. In contrast, fully downloading content to a [[hard drive]] or other form of storage media may allow offline access in the future.

Specialist networks known as [[content delivery network]]s help distribute content over the Internet by ensuring both high availability and high performance. Alternative technologies for content delivery include [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] technologies. Alternatively, [[content delivery platform]]s create and syndicate content remotely, acting like hosted [[content management system]]s.

However, the term is also used in [[film distribution]] to describe distribution of content through physical media, in opposition to distribution by analog media such as [[photographic film]] and [[magnetic tape]] (see [[digital cinema]]).

==Basis==
A primary characteristic of online distribution is its direct nature. To make a commercially successful work, [[artist]]s usually must enter their industry’s [[publishing]] chain. Publishers help artists [[advertise]], [[Funding|fund]] and [[Distribution (business)|distribute]] their work to [[retail]] outlets. In some industries, particularly video games, artists find themselves bound to publishers, and in many cases unable to make the content they want; the publisher might not think it will profit well. This can quickly lead to the standardization of the content and to the stifling of new, potentially risky ideas.

By opting for online distribution, an artist can get their work into the public sphere of interest easily with potentially minimum business [[overhead (business)|overhead]]. This often leads to cheaper goods for the [[consumer]], increased profits for the artists, as well as increased artistic freedom. Online distribution platforms often contain or act as a form of [[digital rights management]].

Online distribution also opens the door to new business models (e.g., the [[Open Music Model]]). For instance, an artist could release one track from an album or one chapter from a book at a time instead of waiting for them all to be completed. This either gives them a cash boost to help continue their projects or warns that their work is not financially viable. This is hopefully done before they have spent excessive money and time on a project deemed unviable. Video games have increased flexibility in this area, demonstrated by [[micropayment]] models. A clear result of these new models is their accessibility to smaller artists or artist teams who do not have the time, funds, or expertise to make a new product in one go.

An example of this can be found in the music industry. Indie artists may access the same distribution channels as major record labels, with potentially fewer restrictions and manufacturing costs.&lt;ref name=DDLL/&gt; There is a growing collection of 'Internet labels' that offer distribution to unsigned or independent artists directly to [[online music store]]s, and in some cases marketing and promotion services. Further, many bands are able to bypass this completely, and offer their music for sale via their own independently controlled websites.

An issue is the large number of incompatible formats in which content is delivered, restricting the devices that may be used, or making data conversion necessary.

==Impact on traditional retail==
The rise of online distribution has provided controversy for the traditional business models and resulted in challenges as well as new opportunities for traditional retailers and publishers. Online distribution affects all of the traditional media markets including music, press, and broadcasting. In Britain, the [[iPlayer]], a software application for streaming television and radio, accounts for 5% of all bandwidth used in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=KEA&gt;{{cite web|last=Kern|first=Philippe|title=The Impact of Digital Distribution – A Contribution|url=http://www.keanet.eu/docs/impactondigitaldistribution.pdf|publisher=Think Tank|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The move towards online distribution led to a dip in sales in the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] when CD sales were nearly cut in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goldman |first1=David |title=Music's lost decade: Sales cut in half |url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/02/news/companies/napster_music_industry/ |website=CNN |date=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example of online distribution taking its toll on a retailer is the Canadian music chain [[Sam the Record Man]] who blamed online distribution for having to close a number of its traditional retail venues in 2007–08.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | last =

  | doi =
  | accessdate =  2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One main reason that sales took such a big hit was that unlicensed downloads of digital music was very accessible. With copyright infringement affecting sales, the music industry realized it needed to change its business model to keep up with the rapidly changing technology.&lt;ref name=Janssens&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janssens|first=Jelle |author2=Stijn Vandaele |author3=Tom Vander Beken|title=The Music Industry on (the) Line? Surviving Music Piracy in a Digital Era|journal=European Journal of Crime|year=2009|volume=77|issue=96|doi=10.1163/157181709X429105}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5/4/2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The step that was taken to move the music industry into the online space has been successful for several reasons.  The development of lossy audio compression file formats such as [[MP3]], allows users to compress music files into a high quality format, compressed down to usually a 3-megabyte (MB) file.  The lossless [[FLAC]] format may require only a few megabytes more.  In comparison, the same song might require 30–40 megabytes of storage on a CD.&lt;ref name=Janssens/&gt; The smaller file size yields much greater Internet transfer speeds.

The transition into the online space has boosted sales, and profit for some artists. It has also allowed for potentially lower expenses such as lower coordination costs, lower distribution costs, as well as the possibility for redistributed total profits.&lt;ref name=Janssens/&gt; These lower costs have aided new artists in breaking onto the scene and gaining recognition. In the past, some emerging artists have struggled to find a way to market themselves and compete in the various distribution channels. The Internet may give artists more control over their music in terms of ownership, rights, creative process, pricing, and more. In addition to providing global users with easier access to content, online stores allow users to choose the songs they wish instead of having to purchase an entire album from which there may only be one or two titles that the buyer enjoys.

The number of downloaded single tracks rose from 160 million in 2004 to 795 million in 2006 which accounted for a revenue boost from US$397 million to US$2 billion.&lt;ref name=Janssens/&gt;

===Videos===
Many traditional network television shows, movies and other video content is now available online, either from the content owner directly or from third party services. [[YouTube]], [[Netflix]], [[Hulu]], [[Vudu]], [[Amazon Video|Amazon Prime Video]], [[DirecTV]], [[Sling TV|SlingTV]] and other Internet-based video services allow content owners to let users access their content on computers, smart phones, tablets or by using appliances such as video game consoles, set-top boxes or [[Smart TV]]s.

Many film distributors also include a [[Digital copy|Digital Copy]], also called Digital HD, with [[Blu-ray disc]], [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]], [[3D Blu-ray]] or a [[DVD]].

===Books===
Some companies, such as Bookmasters Distribution, which invested US$4.5 million in upgrading its equipment and operating systems, have had to direct capital toward keeping up with the changes in technology. The phenomenon of books going digital has given users the ability to access their books on handheld digital book readers. One benefit of electronic book readers is that they allow users to access additional content via hypertext links. These electronic book readers also give users portability for their books since a reader can hold multiple books depending on the size of its [[hard drive]].&lt;ref name=MacInnes&gt;{{cite web|last=MacInnes |first=Ian |title=Impediments to Digital Distribution for Software and Books |url=http://content.epnet.com/pdf10/pdf/2005/W42/01Jan05/17783232.pdf?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=17783232&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeprY4y9f3OLCmr0qep7BSsKe4S7CWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPPt43nzsct55%2BS5krGvs0gA&amp;D=ufh |publisher=ProQuest |accessdate=8 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that are able to adapt and make changes to capitalize on the digital media market have seen sales surge. Vice President of [[Perseus Books Group]] stated that since shifting to electronic books (e-books), it saw sales rise by 68%. [[Independent Publishers Group]] experienced a sales boost of 23% in the first quarter of 2012 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Rosen | first = Judith  |work=Publishers Weekly | title = Distribution in a Digital Age | date = 2012-04-16 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/1002661729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tor Books]], a major publisher of science fiction and fantasy books, started to sell [[e-book]]s [[digital rights management|DRM-free]] by July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tor/Forge E-book Titles to Go DRM-Free |url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/04/torforge-e-book-titles-to-go-drm-free|publisher=Tor.com |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later the publisher stated that they will keep this model as removing DRM was not hurting their digital distribution ebook business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2013/05/tor-books-says-cutting-drm-out-of-its-e-books-hasnt-hurt-business/|title=Tor Books says cutting DRM out of its e-books hasn’t hurt the business - A look at the sci-fi publisher a year after it announced it would do away with DRM. |first=Megan|last=Geuss |date=2013-05-04 |accessdate=2013-07-07 |publisher=[[Arstechnica]] |quote=''Early this week, Tor Books, a subsidiary of Tom Doherty Associates and the world's leading publisher of science fiction, gave an update on how its decision to do away with Digital Rights Management (DRM) schemes has impacted the company. Long story short: it hasn't, really.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller e-book publishers such as [[O'Reilly Media]], [[Carina Press]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tor/Forge Plans DRM-Free e-Books By July|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/51659-tor-forge-plans-drm-free-e-books-by-july.html |accessdate=24 April 2012|newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Baen Books]] had already forgone DRM previously.

=== Video games ===
{{main article|Digital distribution in video games}}
Online distribution is changing the structure of the [[video game industry]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Gabe Newell]], creator of the digital distribution service [[Steam (software)|Steam]], formulated the advantages over physical [[retail]] distribution as such:

{{Quote|''The worst days [for game development] were the cartridge days for the NES. It was a huge risk – you had all this money tied up in silicon in a warehouse somewhere, and so you’d be conservative in the decisions you felt you could make, very conservative in the IPs you signed, your art direction would not change, and so on. Now it’s the opposite extreme: we can put something up on Steam, deliver it to people all around the world, make changes. We can take more interesting risks.[...] Retail doesn’t know how to deal with those games. On Steam [a digital distributor] there’s no shelf-space restriction.''|[[Gabe Newell]]|''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]''&lt;ref name=newell2007&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2007/11/21/rps-exclusive-gabe-newell-interview/|title=RPS Exclusive: Gabe Newell Interview |date=2007-11-22 |accessdate=2013-06-28 |first=John |last=Walker |quote=''The worst days [for game development] were the cartridge days for the NES.

Since the 2000s, there has been an increasing number of smaller and niche titles available and commercially successful, like e.g. [[Remake (software)|remakes]] of classic games.&lt;ref name="monkeyislandrerelease"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/iphone/adventure/thesecretofmonkeyislandspecialedition/tech_info.html |title=The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition Tech Info |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=November 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/990/990254p1.html |title=E3 2009: The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition Preview |date=June 2, 2009 |first=Charles |last=Onyett |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=November 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527144404/http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/990/990254p1.html |archivedate=May 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new possibility of the digital distribution stimulated also the creation of game titles of very small video game producers like [[Independent game developer]]&lt;ref name=garr11&gt;{{cite web|title=Download distribution opening new doors for independent game developers|url=http://www.statesman.com/business/technology/download-distribution-opening-new-doors-for-independent-game-1409285.html|publisher=Statesman.com|date=17 April 2011|last=Garr|first=Brian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421074810/http://www.statesman.com/business/technology/download-distribution-opening-new-doors-for-independent-game-1409285.html|archivedate=21 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stuart10&gt;{{cite web|last=Stuart|first=Keith|title=Back to the bedroom: how indie gaming is reviving the Britsoft spirit|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/jan/26/casual-gaming-indiegames|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 November 2012|date=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mod (video gaming)|Modders]] (e.g. [[Garry's Mod]]&lt;ref name="garrysmod"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/03/16/garrys-mod-has-sold-1-4-million-copies-garry-releases-sales-history-to-prove-it/|title=Garry’s Mod has sold 1.4 million copies, Garry releases sales history to prove it |first=Tom|last=Senior|date=2012-03-16|accessdate=2013-06-28 |publisher=[[PCGamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which were before not commercially feasible.

The years after 2004 saw the rise of many digital distribution services on the PC, such as [[Amazon.com#Amazon Publishing|Amazon Digital Services]], [[Desura]], [[GameStop]], [[Games for Windows – Live]], [[Impulse (software)|Impulse]], [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[Origin (digital distribution software)|Origin]], [[Direct2Drive]], [[GOG.com]], and [[GamersGate]]. The offered properties differ significantly: while most of these digital distributors don't allow reselling of bought games, ''[[Green Man Gaming]]'' allows this. Another example is ''[[gog.com]]'' which has a strict [[Digital rights management|non-DRM]] policy&lt;ref name="arspreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/09/first-look-gog-revives-classic-pc-games-for-download-age.ars |title=First look: GOG revives classic PC games for download age |accessdate=2012-12-27 |first=Frank|last=Caron |date=2008-09-09 |publisher=Ars Technica |quote=''[...] [Good Old Games] focuses on bringing old, time-tested games into the downloadable era with low prices and no DRM.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; while most other services allow various (strict or less strict) forms of DRM.

Next important thing is that the digital distribution is more eco-friendly than physical. Optical disc is made of [[polycarbonate]] plastic and [[aluminum]]. The creation of 30 CDs requires the use of 300 cubic feet of [[natural gas]], 2 cups of oil and 24 gallons of water. The boxes for CDs are made from [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), which increases the risk of cancer.&lt;ref name=CW&gt;{{cite web|publisher=CodesWholesale.com |url=https://codeswholesale.com/blog/why-digital-is-greener-than-the-boxed-video-games/|title=Why digital is greener than the boxed video games? |date=2016-04-22 |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
A general issue is the large number of incompatible data formats in which content is delivered, possibly restricting the devices that may be used, or making data conversion necessary.  [[Streaming media|Streaming]] services can have several drawbacks: requiring a constant Internet connection to use content; the restriction of some content to never be stored locally; the restriction of content from being transferred to [[physical media]]; and the enabling of greater censorship at the discretion of owners of content, infrastructure, and consumer devices.

'''''Eating Animals''''' is the third book by the American novelist [[Jonathan Safran Foer]], published in [[2009 in literature|2009]]. It was written in close collaboration with Farm Forward, a 501(c)(3) [[nonprofit organization]] that implements innovative strategies to promote conscientious food choices, reduce farmed animal suffering, and advance [[sustainable agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://farmforward.com/mission/|title=Farm Forward Mission|website=farmforward.com|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''New York Times'' best-seller,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2009/12/06/hardcover-nonfiction/|title=Hardcover Nonfiction Books - Best Sellers - December 6, 2009 - The New York Times|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eating Animals'' provides a dense discussion of what it means to eat animals in an industrialized world. It was adapted and extended into a 2018 documentary film with the same name, directed by [[Christopher Dillon Quinn]] and co-narrated by Foer and [[Natalie Portman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/movies/eating-animals-review.html |title=Review: ‘Eating Animals’ Skewers Factory Farming |last=Kenigsberg |first=Ben |date=2018-06-14 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-06-15 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Foer presents the book as a way for him to decide whether or not his newborn child should eat meat. Foer’s son is representative of the generations that are entering a world of industrialized farming, in which the decision to eat meat has many more implications than taste. More often than not, putting meat on our plates comes with immense ramifications not only for the animals involved, but also for the environment, and ourselves; the animals suffer, the environment is damaged, and our health is put into question. Essentially, Foer concludes that the detriments of factory farms outweigh the benefits of taste, which is why he chooses to raise his son a vegan.

Throughout the book, Foer places significant emphasis on the stories that come with food. To strengthen the emphasis, both the first and the last chapters of the book are entitled “storytelling.” In the book, Foer states that “stories about food are stories about us―our history and our values,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eating Animals|last=Safran Foer|first=Jonathan|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=2009|isbn=978-0-316-08664-6 |location=|pages=9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and establishes storytelling as the overriding theme of the whole book. For Foer, storytelling is a way of recognizing and dealing with the complexity of the subject that is eating animals, and how it is connected to identity. The stories in our plates are the stories about our relationship with the world as represented by the people we eat with, the process by which our food reaches the table, what kinds of food find their ways to our table, etc. According to Foer, the way humans cope with and understand complex phenomena is by turning their occurrences into stories about what they mean. In this sense, the suggested profundity within the phenomenon of meat eating gives Foer’s concept of storytelling a religious undertone.

As the title suggests, the particular phenomenon Foer focuses on is the consumption of meat. He discusses what eating meat has meant in the past, and what it means today. In doing so, he does not, as one might expect, make the claim that eating meat is intrinsically bad. Rather, he claims that eating meat is circumstantially bad; for example, it is bad when it entails the suffering of animals, environmental destruction, and/or a risk for human health. Today, according to the book and a number of its cited sources, eating meat overwhelmingly entails these problems, while in the past, it has not.  The conclusion Foer reaches is that eating animals that come from industrial methods―such as factory farming, industrial fishing, and the like―is bad.

Foer notes that most people recognize there is something bad about eating animals, but that people willingly forget this is the case. Part of what is forgotten in this process, Foer argues, is a connection to our own animality. We neglect the parts of us that makes us similar to them―like, for example, the ability to feel or be relieved of pain―and we deny their importance in the constitution of our humanity. As Foer puts it, “what we forget about animals, we begin to forget about ourselves.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eating Animals|last=Safran Foer|first=Jonathan|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=2009|isbn=9780316086646|location=|pages=21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this leads to, Foer argues, is a fairly ambiguous sense of shame―the feeling of shame that arises when memory reminds us of what we have willingly forgotten.

Forgetfulness, the book suggests, is reinforced and perpetuated by the lack of transparency in the [[meat industry]]. Farms are generally closed to the public, and it is so difficult to get inside of one that Foer illegally sneaks into one to write about the conditions of the typical factory farm. During his operation, he witnesses the dismal conditions in which the animals live, which helps him understand why the industry seeks confidentiality. He describes this experience as a direct contrast to the marketing tactics used by factory farms. In an attempt to shine light on the meaning of such marketing claims, Foer dedicates a whole chapter to definitions of words that connect humans and food. In it, he defines some of the labels and certifications that are assigned to animal products, suggesting that many of them are misleading.

Ultimately, ''Eating Animals'' discusses the ethics of food. It suggests that our food choices directly reflect the ethical values we stand for. When people eat meat, Foer claims, they are implying that satisfying their desire for meat is more important than letting animals live well, or even live at all. This can be a conscious or unconscious process, but its implications, for Foer, are always real. When one supports factory farming, one is relinquishing the importance of certain moral behavior to animals, and in turn, to humans as well. For example, if one denies the importance of the suffering of an animal, one denies the importance of the ability to suffer in and of itself, so it follows that one denies the importance of suffering for humans. In a similar chain of logic, Foer connects our treatment of animals to our treatment of humans―we dichotomize between those who matter and those who do not. Consequently, each food choice an individual makes is an ethical one that profoundly impacts both human and non-human animals.

==Critical reception==
A ''New York Times'' best-seller, ''Eating Animals'' has received mixed reviews from critics. A ''Washington Post'' article describes Foer's book as providing a writing style that has "always divided his readers into love-him or hate-him camps."&lt;ref name="yonan2009"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/20/AR2009112001684.html|title=Jonathan Safran Foer's animal farm|last=Yonan|first=Joe|date=2009-11-22|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some critics praise both the conclusions Foer reaches and how he reaches them. A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article states that ''Eating Animals'' contains "the kind of wisdom that... deserves a place at the table with our greatest philosophers."&lt;ref name="reynolds2009"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-jonathan-safran-foer8-2009nov08,0,2918198.story|title='Eating Animals' by Jonathan Safran Foer|last=Reynolds|first=Susan Salter|date=2009-11-08|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Huffington Post article, [[Natalie Portman]] claimed that the book was so powerful that she went from a twenty-year vegetarian to a vegan activist.&lt;ref name="portman2009"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/natalie-portman/jonathan-safran-foers-iea_b_334407.html|title=Jonathan Safran Foer's ''Eating Animals'' turned me vegan|last=Portman|first=Natalie|date=2009-10-27|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a piece by the [[The New Yorker|''New Yorker'']], the power of the book lies in its ability to discuss why humans can be so loving to their companion animals while simultaneously being completely indifferent to the ones they eat.&lt;ref name="kolbert2009"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/11/09/091109crbo_books_kolbert|title=Flesh of your flesh|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|date=2009-11-09|newspaper=The New Yorker|authorlink=Elizabeth Kolbert|accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics have criticized the book for various reasons. In a ''New York Magazine'' review, one vegetarian critic called the book "deeply irritating," as it "settles on the safest possible non-conclusion."&lt;ref name="anderson2009"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/reviews/61735/|title='Eating Animals,' by Jonathan Safran Foer|last=Anderson|first=Sam|date=2009-11-01|newspaper=New York Magazine|accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentary ==
Award-winning producer Christopher Quinn and actress [[Natalie Portman]] have produced a documentary version of ''Eating Animals''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/movies/eating-animals-review.html|title=Review: ‘Eating Animals’ Skewers Factory Farming|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the book, the documentary explores the realities of contemporary animal agriculture as it is related to the complexities of food ethics. The documentary hopes to expand the reach of ''Eating Animals''{{’}} message so that more people think of the meat they eat in new ways. The film opened in select cities June 15, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/eating-animals|title=With Eating Animals, Alice Waters, Natalie Portman, and Jonathan Safran-Foer Invite You to Join the Food Underground|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|work=HWD|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Egon Bretscher''' (1901–1973) was a Swiss-born British chemist and nuclear physicist&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=French|first=Anthony|date=October 1973|title=Egon Bretscher|url=https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3128290|journal=Physics Today|volume=26|pages=73|via=American Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Head of the Nuclear Physics Division from 1948 to 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British Scientists and the Manhattan Project: The Los Alamos Years|last=Morton Szasz|first=Ferenc|publisher=Springer|year=1992|isbn=978-1-349-12731-3|location=|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]], also known as [[Harwell Laboratory]], in [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]], [[United Kingdom]].

== Early life ==

Born near [[Zurich]], Switzerland and educated at the [[Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule]] (ETH) there, Bretscher gained a PhD degree in organic chemistry at [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] in 1926.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He returned to Zurich as privat docent to [[Peter Debye]], later moving in 1936 to work in [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford’s]] laboratory at the [[Cavendish laboratory|Cavendish]] in Cambridge as a Rockefeller Scholar. Here he switched to research in [[nuclear physics]], proposing (with [[Norman Feather]]) in 1940 that the 239 isotope of element 94 could be produced from the common isotope of [[uranium-238]] by [[neutron capture]] and that, like [[Uranium-235|U-235]], this should be able to sustain a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. A similar conclusion was independently arrived at by [[Edwin McMillan]] and [[Philip Abelson]] at [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]]. In addition, he devised theoretical chemical procedures for purifying this unknown element away from the parent uranium; this element was named [[Plutonium]] by [[Nicholas Kemmer]].

Bretscher used to joke that his main contribution to physics occurred in the summer of 1930, when he was climbing in the [[Val Bregaglia|Bergel]] region near [[Engadin]] with another student, [[Felix Bloch]], in the [[Swiss Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British Scientists and the Manhattan Project: The Los Alamos Years|last=Morton Szasz|first=Ferenc|publisher=Springer|year=1992|isbn=978-1-349-12731-3|location=|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloch slipped over an icy edge but was saved, as he fell,  by the rope joining him to Bretscher. The latter's swift action in driving his ice axe into the ice prevented their combined demise. After raising the alarm, Bretscher returned with a guide and spent the night with Bloch discussing physics. It took guides a further three days to bring Bloch down. Bloch later won the [[Nobel Prize]] for physics for his discovery of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]].

== Manhattan Project ==

In 1944 he became a part of the [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|British Mission]] to the [[Manhattan Project]] in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]] led by [[James Chadwick]], where he made the first measurements on the energy released in fusion processes. During his time in Los Alamos, he took many [[Kodachrome]] slides which appear to constitute a unique coloured record of that research site. His pictures, which are now held by the [[Churchill Archives Centre]], include photographs of [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Edward Teller]] and the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]] site in New Mexico after the first atomic bomb was detonated, showing the surface light brown sand turned to a green-blue glass.

== Harwell Laboratory ==

In 1947 he was invited by [[John Cockcroft]] to head the Chemistry Division at the newly established [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] at [[Harwell, Oxfordshire]], England and in 1948 succeeded [[Otto Frisch]] as head of the Nuclear Physics Division there. Amongst his colleagues were [[Bruno Pontecorvo]] in the Nuclear Physics Division, and [[Klaus Fuchs]] who was the head of the Theoretical Physics Division. He was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Most Excellent Order (CBE)]] on retirement from Harwell.

Bretscher died in Switzerland in 1973. Of his two daughters and three sons, [[Mark Bretscher]] and [[Anthony P. Bretscher|Anthony Bretscher]] are cell biologists, whilst [[Peter Bretscher]] is an immunologist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3986">'''Fiberglass reinforced plastic grating''' (also known as '''FRP grating''', '''glass reinforced plastic grating''' or '''fiberglass grating''') is a [[composite material]] manufactured by combining a matrix of [[resin]] and [[fiberglass]]. Fiberglass grating does not corrode like steel grating and is therefore used in corrosive environments to reduce maintenance costs. It is used in a variety of applications including walkways and overhead platforms. FRP grating is a structural product that can be weight-bearing between spans.

== Types ==
Molded FRP grating is composed of alternating directional layers of continuous glass fiber for strength, with resin to consolidate the fibers and provide the shape and corrosion-resistance. Due to its bidirectional strength, molded grating can tolerate cutouts in the panel to allow pipe or equipment penetrations without requiring additional support around the opening. Molded grating has very high impact tolerance, as well as the highest chemical resistance of any fiberglass grating. It can be made slip-resistant by adding grit to the surface.

Pultruded FRP grating consists of continuous glass strands encased in resin and wrapped in a surfacing veil which protects the fibers and allows resin to saturate the outermost part of the bar as well as penetrate between the glass fibers. This ensures a smooth and corrosion-resistant surface, with a higher glass/resin ratio than molded products. The individual bars are then assembled using cross bars and epoxy to mechanically join the load bars. Pultruded grating has unidirectional strength, with its much higher glass content resulting in a greater span capability than molded products. This product is usually specified in applications requiring larger spans or heavier loading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiberglassgratingpros.com|title=Custom Safety Handrail &amp; Ladder Systems - OSHA Approved|website=www.fiberglassgratingpros.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resins ==
Many resin types may be used in pultrusion including [[polyester]], [[polyurethane]], [[vinylester]] [[epoxy]], [[isophthalic polyester]], Orthophthalic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertypultrusions.com/fiberglass-grating/|title=FRP Grating - Molded Fiberglass Gratings - Liberty Pultrusions|website=www.libertypultrusions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[phenolic resin|phenolics]].

== Applications ==
Fiberglass grating is often used when there are safety concerns due to liquids or oils on the floor and more corrosive environments needing chemical resistance.

Many different applications can benefit from Fiberglass Grating, such as: Walkways, Platforms, Protective Shielding, Machinery Housings, Raised Floors and Stairways

In addition, Industries that use Molded Fiberglass Grating can include bottling lines, food processing plants, lift stations, commercial aquariums, lube oil facilities, plating shops, beverage canning facilities, chemical plants and pulp and paper plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertypultrusions.com/molded-fiberglass-grating/|title=Molded Fiberglass Gratings - FRP Grating - Liberty Pultrusions|website=www.libertypultrusions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fiberglass reinforced plastic stair tread panels == 
Stair tread panels can also be manufactured using FRP technology. Molded stair treads provide corrosion resistance, durability, and ease of fabrication and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertypultrusions.com/fiberglass-grating/stair-tread-panels/|title=FRP Gratings - Stair Tread Panels - Liberty Pultrusions|website=www.libertypultrusions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Đó.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Traditional fish traps, [[Hà Tây]], [[Vietnam]].]]
A '''fish trap''' is a [[trapping|trap]] used for fishing. Fish traps can have the form of a [[fishing weir]] or a [[lobster trap]]. Some [[fishing net]]s are also called fish traps, for example fyke nets.

A typical contemporary trap consists of a frame of thick steel wire in the shape of a heart, with [[chicken wire]] stretched around it. The mesh wraps around the frame and then tapers into the inside of the trap. When a fish swims inside through this opening, it cannot get out, as the chicken wire opening bends back into its original narrowness. Contemporary eel traps come in many shapes and sizes and are constructed of many materials. In earlier times, traps were constructed of wood and fibre.

==History==
[[File:Myles Birket Foster The Eel Traps.jpg|thumb|left|Eel traps in England, 1899, by [[Myles Birket Foster]]]]
[[File:Valkenburg De Woerd visfuik.jpg|thumb|Fish trap, Roman period; found in Valkenburg, the Netherlands]]
Traps are culturally almost universal and seem to have been independently invented many times. There are essentially two types of trap, a permanent or semi-permanent structure placed in a river or tidal area and bottle or pot trap that are usually, but not always baited to attract prey, and are periodically lifted out of the water.

The Mediterranean Sea, with an area of about of 2.5 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (970,000 sq mi), is shaped according to the principle of a bottle trap. It is easy for fish from the Atlantic Ocean to swim into the Mediterranean through the narrow neck at Gibraltar, and difficult for them to find their way out. It has been described as "the largest fish trap in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Bhuyan, Vishaal B (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ckjsHtiC5W4C&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=mediterranean+%22fish+trap+in+the+world%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Dx8O4wlyeV&amp;sig=WCTgwwg3vLt2CGpwZu4WLg8NxbI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=opG4T9PBMYbYigfp4aGKCQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mediterranean%20%22fish%20trap%20in%20the%20world%22&amp;f=false ''The Esoteric Investor: Alternative Investments for Global Macro Investors''] FT Press. {{ISBN|9780132485074}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[prehistoric]] [[Yaghan]] people who inhabited the [[Tierra Del Fuego]] area constructed stonework in shallow inlets that would effectively confine fish at low tide levels. Some of this extant stonework survives at [[Bahia Wulaia]] at the Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens [[archaeological]] site.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18795 ''Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens'', Megalithic Portal'', ed. Andy Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt;

In southern Italy, during the 17th century, a new fishing technique began to be used. The [[trabucco]] is an old [[commercial fishing|fishing]] machine typical of the coast of [[Gargano]] protected as historical monuments by the homonym National Park. This giant trap, built in structural wood, is spread along the coast of southern [[Adriatic]] especially in the [[province of Foggia]], in some areas of the [[Abruzzo|Abruzzese]] coastlines and also in some parts of the coast of southern [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].

[[File:West Mediterranean sea topographic map.svg|thumb|right|The Mediterranean sea has been described as the world's largest fish trap.]]

[[Indigenous Australians]] were, prior to European colonisation, most populous in Australia's better-watered areas such as the [[Murray-Darling Basin|Murray-Darling]] river system of the south-east. Here, where water levels fluctuate seasonally, [[indigenous people]] constructed ingenious stone fish traps.&lt;ref&gt;Jared Diamond: ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]: The Fates of Human Societies''. page 310. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, March 1997. {{ISBN|0-393-03891-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most have been completely or partially destroyed. The largest and best-known are those on the Barwon River at [[Brewarrina, New South Wales]], which are at least partly preserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deh.gov.au/heritage/national/sites/brewarrina.html Brewarrina Aboriginal Fish Traps].&lt;/ref&gt; The Brewarrina fish traps caught huge numbers of migratory native fish as the Barwon River rose in flood and then fell. In southern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], indigenous people created an elaborate system of [[canals]], some more than 2&amp;nbsp;km long. The purpose of these canals was to attract and catch [[eel]]s, a fish of short coastal rivers (as opposed to rivers of the Murray-Darling system). The eels were caught by a variety of traps including stone walls constructed across canals with a net placed across an opening in the wall. Traps at different levels in the marsh came into operation as the water level rose and fell. Somewhat similar stone-wall traps were constructed by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Pit River]] people in north-eastern [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primitiveways.com/ajumawi_fish_traps.html Ajumawi Fish Traps].&lt;/ref&gt;

A technique called [[dam]] fishing is used by the [[Baka (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] pygmies. This involves the construction of a temporary dam resulting in a drop in the water levels downstream&amp;mdash; allowing fish to be easily collected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pygmies.org/baka/dam-fishing.php Dam Fishing] Fishing techniques of the Baka.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also used in [[Chile]], mainly in Chiloé, which were unusually abundant (fish weir and basket fish trap).

==Types and methods==
The manner in which fish traps are used depends on local conditions and the behaviour of the local fish. For example, a fish trap might be placed in shallow water near rocks where [[pike (fish)|pike]]s like to lie. If placed correctly, traps can be very effective. It is usually not necessary to check the trap daily, since the fish remain alive inside the trap, relatively unhurt. Because of this, the trap also allows for the release of undersized fish as per fishing regulations.

| [[File:NOR Cod Pot - Phillip Meintzer - Aug 2016.jpg|120px]]
| In 2017 research was reported on the suitability of using baited fishing pots for catching [[Atlantic cod]]. [[Fish stock|Stocks]] of this once popular commercial fish appear to be recovering after a [[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|major fishery collapse]]. The use of appropriately designed pots can have less environmental impact than other fishing strategies, but to be practical they need to catch their targets both efficiently and selectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meintzer|first=Phillip|last2=Walsh|first2=Philip|last3=Favaro|first3=Brett|date=2017-02-08|title=Will you swim into my parlour?

|-
| align="center"| Basic bottle trap
| [[File:うけ瓶の使い方02.png|120px]]
| Bottle traps are also known as ''pot traps''. This type of trap is portable, and is used to catch small fish and other small aquatic animals. It consists of a container shaped somewhat like a bottle, usually with an inverted funnel at the entrance. It can be constructed from a plastic bottle, or a glass jar or earthenware pot, or woven with wire or flax. The trap is lowered into the water on a line, where it is left either at the bottom, or suspended at some depth beneath the surface. Bait is usually, but not always used to lure the prey inside. Variants of this basic trap have been used from early times in countries around the world.
|-
| align="center"| [[Crab trap]]
| [[File:Catching crabs.jpg|120px]]
| Different types of [[crab trap]]s are used depending on regional preferences, the type of crab targeted and the underwater topography. Typically, they are constructed as wire cages, as shown in the image.
|-
| align="center"| Eel trap
| [[File:Myles Birket Foster The Eel Traps.jpg|120px]]
| Traditionally, eel traps were widespread, and have been invented independently around the world. The New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]] wove intricate eel pots they called ''{{visible anchor|hīnaki}}'' from the stems of climbing plants. At their best, these were works of art.&lt;ref&gt;Keane, Basil (2009) [http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/te-hopu-tuna-eeling/3 Te hopu tuna – eeling - Hīnaki – eel pots] ''Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand''. Updated 1 March 2009, retrieved 22 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| align="center"| Fyke net
| [[File:Fuiken.jpg|120px]]
| A fyke net is made from a bag-shaped net held open by hoops. These can be linked together in long chains, and are used to catch eels in rivers. Fyke nets equipped with wings and leaders are used in sheltered places in lakes where there is plenty of plant life. Hundreds of these nets can be connected into systems where it is not practical to build large fixed structures.
|-
| align="center"|  Katiska trap
| [[File:Katiskaa kokemassa.jpg|120px]]
| A ''katiska'' is a portable fish trap used in Finland. It is a lightweight and made from [[chicken wire]]. The trap can either be collapsible or rigid, and is easily placed at any depth since it needs no anchoring. Katiska are commonly used in hobby fishing, since they catch only a small number of fish. The photo shows a fisherman checking a ''katiska''.
|-
| align="center"| [[Lobster pot]]
| [[File:Lobster pots at Beer, Devon.JPG|120px]]
| A [[lobster pot]] is a portable trap used to trap [[lobster]]s or [[crayfish]]. An opening permits the lobster to enter a tunnel of netting. Lobster pots are usually constructed in two parts from wire and wood. The lobster enters the first part, called the "chamber" or "kitchen", where there is bait. It then moves into the "parlour", where it is trapped. Lobster pots can hold several lobsters. They are usually dropped to the sea floor about a dozen at a time, and are marked by a [[buoy]] so they can be picked up later.
|-
| align="center"|  Octopus trap
| [[File:蛸壺（明石）P5231862.JPG|120px]]
| In Japan, the Mediterranean, and other regions, an ancient variant is used to catch octopuses. They are usually heavy earthenware pots, and do not have an inverted funnel. These traps are left on the sea floor for days at a time. Octopuses enter and remain inside, using the pot as shelter and protection. No bait is used. When the pot is raised, the octopus will not normally try to escape. See also [[:ja:蛸壺]].
|-
| align="center"| Soda bottle&lt;br /&gt;or glass jar&lt;br /&gt;trap
| [[File:Fish traps in Haikou -.pile of prepared traps.jpg|120px]]
| In [[Haikou]], China, local people make bottle traps with small, glass jars. Local craftspeople produce a variant made from a two-litre soda bottle. This type has an inverted funnel made by cutting off the top of the bottle a few centimetres down the neck, and making vertical cuts downward. This produces ''tabs'' which are then be pushed inward, producing the inverted funnel shape. A stone is attached to the side of the bottle, and several meters of line are provided. Numerous holes are drilled through the bottle to allow water to enter and escape. These are sold by the seaside for 6 [[RMB|yuan]], along with a small bag of flour for bait.
|-
| align="center"| Stickleback trap
| [[File:Stickleback trap.jpg|120px]]
| The [[stickleback trap]] is a variant of the soda bottle trap.

| align="center"| [[Almadraba]]
| [[File:La pesca del tonno, acquaforte di Jean-Pierre Houël.jpg|120px]]
| [[Almadraba]] is an ancient [[Andalusia]]n way of catching [[tuna]]. It is an elaborate way of setting nets in a maze that leads to a central killing pool. In Sicily the mazes of nets, and also the places where the nets are set are called ''Tonnara'', and the overall method of capturing the fishes is called ''Mattanza''. This takes place during spring and the beginning of summer when tuna tend to go into the Mediterranean.

| [[File:Double-Heart of Stacked Stones 20150721.jpg|120px]]
| The [[Double-Heart of Stacked Stones|Double-heart of stacked stones]] is a stone [[Fishing weir|weir]] located on the north side of [[Cimei]], an island in the [[Pescadores|Penghu]] archipelago to the west of [[Taiwan]]. It is a well-preserved ancient [[Fishing weir|fish trap]] made by stacking stones to form a trap that resembles a flying heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/10/07/2003205948/print |title=A Passage to Penghu |accessdate=2008-02-15 |last= |first= |date=2004-10-07  |work= |publisher=Taipei Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| align="center"|  [[Fishing weir]]
| [[File:Fish Trap BKG.png|120px]]
| A [[fishing weir]] is an obstruction placed in tidal waters or wholly or partially across a river, which is designed to hinder the passage of fish. Traditionally they were built from wood or stones. Fish such as salmon can be trapped when they attempt to swim upstream, other fish such as eels can be trapped when they attempt to migrate downstream. As fish traps, fishing weirs date back to the Bronze Age in Sweden and to Roman times in the UK. They were used by native North Americans and early settlers to catch fish for trade and to feed their communities. 
|-
| align="center"|  [[Fish wheel]]
| [[File:Wooden Fish Wheel.jpg|120px]]
| A [[fish wheel]] is a device for catching fish which operates much as a water-powered mill wheel.  A wheel complete with baskets and paddles is attached to a floating dock.  The wheel rotates due to the current of the stream it is placed into.  The baskets on the wheel capture fish traveling upstream.  The fish caught in the baskets fall into a holding tank.  When the holding tank is full, the fish are removed. 
|-
| align="center"|  [[Putcher]]
| [[File:Putchers.jpg|120px]]
| [[Putcher|Putcher traps]] are ancient traps used for catching salmon. They are peculiar to the [[River Severn]] in Great Britain. A putcher is a conical-shaped basket about five feet long. A number of putchers are tied together in rows standing four or five feet high to form a "rank". The rank is set against the incoming or outgoing tide. Traditionally putchers were made of [[hazel]] rods with [[willow]] plait. More modern baskets can use steel or aluminium wire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salmonboats.co.uk/1252.html Putcher Use in the Severn Estuary]&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| align="center"|  [[Trabucco]]
| [[File:Trabucco Rodi Garganico.jpg|120px]]
| A [[trabucco]] is a shore-operated lift net, a platform anchored to rocks by large logs of [[Aleppo pine]]. Two or more long wooden arms jut out into the sea, where they suspend a narrow-meshed net some feet above the water. They are found along the coast of [[Gargano]], where they are protected as historical monuments. Another variant is found along the coasts of [[Abruzzo]] and [[Molise]], where they are installed in shallower waters, and use a platform which runs parallel to the coast instead of jutting out into the water.
|-
| align="center"|  Wagenya trap
| [[File:Wagenya Rapids.JPG|120px]]
| The [[Wagenya]] people, in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], build a huge system of wooden tripods across the river. These tripods are anchored on the holes naturally carved in the rock by the water current. To these tripods are anchored large baskets, which are lowered in the rapids to "sieve" the waters for fish. The baskets are designed and sized to trap only large fish. The Wagenya lift the baskets twice daily to check for fish, which are retrieved by swimmers.

[[File:GHS-pictogram-flamme.svg|thumb|The [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals|international]] [[GHS hazard pictograms|pictogram]] for flammable chemicals.]]
[[File:HAZMAT Class 3 Flammable Liquids.png|thumb|Flammable placard]]
Generally, a '''flammable liquid''' is a combustible liquid that can easily catch [[fire]]. However, it is not the liquid itself that burns, but the vapor cloud above the liquid that will burn if the vapor's concentration in air is between the [[lower flammable limit]] (LFL) and [[upper flammable limit]] (UFL) of the liquid.

==Definitions==
A number of attempts have been made to standardise the definition of 'flammable' based on the need to classify such fluids as presenting a higher risk of ignition and therefore needing additional precautions. 

In the US, a flammable liquid is defined as one with a [[flash point]] below {{convert|100|°F|abbr=off}}. This definition is part of a categorisation of ''combustible liquids'' used by the [[National Fire Protection Association]], The [[US Department of Transportation]], the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]], the [[US Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] and others.

These categories are further subdivided, depending on the liquid's flash point and [[boiling point]].

*Class IA flammable liquids have a flash point below 73&amp;nbsp;°F (22.8&amp;nbsp;°C) (the upper end of the common range of [[room temperature]]) and a boiling point below 100&amp;nbsp;°F
*Class IB flammable liquids have a flash point below 73&amp;nbsp;°F (22.8&amp;nbsp;°C) and a boiling point greater than or equal to 100&amp;nbsp;°F (37.8&amp;nbsp;°C)
*Class IC flammable liquids have a flash point greater than or equal to 73&amp;nbsp;°F (22.8&amp;nbsp;°C) and below 100&amp;nbsp;°F (37.8&amp;nbsp;°C)
*Class II combustible liquids have a flash point greater than or equal to 100&amp;nbsp;°F (37.8&amp;nbsp;°C) and below 140&amp;nbsp;°F (60&amp;nbsp;°C)
*Class IIIA combustible liquids have a flash point greater than or equal to 140&amp;nbsp;°F (60&amp;nbsp;°C) and below 200&amp;nbsp;°F (93.3&amp;nbsp;°C)
*Class IIIB combustible liquids have a flash point greater than or equal to 200&amp;nbsp;°F (93.3&amp;nbsp;°C)

Upon completion of all project tasks, students are partnered with other nonprofits to build web applications, giving the students practical development experience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=1012&amp;sid=39516051|title=Students learn to code for free while donating skills to nonprofits|last=Garfield|first=Robynn|date=|work=[[KSL-TV]]|language=en|access-date=2017-01-29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
freeCodeCamp was launched in October 2014 and incorporated as Free Code Camp, Inc. The founder, Quincy Larson, is a software developer who took up programming after graduate school and created freeCodeCamp as a way to streamline a student's progress from beginner to being job-ready.
In a 2015 podcast interview, he summarized his motivation for creating freeCodeCamp as follows: “freeCodeCamp is my effort to correct the extremely inefficient and circuitous way I learned to code. I’m committing my career and the rest of my life towards making this process as efficient and painless as possible. […] All those things that made learning to code a nightmare to me are things that we are trying to fix with freeCodeCamp.”&lt;ref name="se-podcast"&gt;{{cite web|title=Software Engineering Daily: Free Code Camp with Quincy Larson|url=https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/10/28/free-code-camp-with-quincy-larson/|website=Software Engineering Daily|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original curriculum focused on [[MongoDB]], [[Express.js]], [[AngularJS]], and [[Node.js]] and was estimated to take 800 hours to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our 1,600 Hour JavaScript Coding Curriculum|url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/our-1-600-hour-javascript-coding-curriculum-d4f151b782d2#.pm77u0w7r|website=freeCodeCamp's Medium publication|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the lessons were links to free material on other platforms, such as [[Codecademy]], [[Stanford]], or [[Code School]]. The course was broken up into “Waypoints” (quick, interactive tutorials), “Bonfires” (algorithm challenges), “Ziplines” (front-end projects), and “Basejumps” (full-stack projects). Completing the front-end and full-stack projects awarded the student with respective certificates.

The curriculum was updated in January 2016 to rely less on outside material, remove the unconventional section names, and switch focus from AngularJS to [[React (JavaScript library)|React.js]] as the front-end library of choice. There were a number of additions to the coursework, including [[D3.js]] and [[Sass (stylesheet language)|Sass]], which brought the total time estimate to 2,080 hours and two more certificates, data visualization and back-end.

After returning from a trip to China, Larson was inspired to launch freeCodeCamp by seeing a young boy's interest towards coding. And he decided to give people the opportunity to learn programming. After six years living in San Francisco, Larson now lives in [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="QuincyInOKC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsok.com/okc-residents-coding-camp-gives-students-experience-through-helping-nonprofits/article/5558043|title=OKC resident's coding camp gives students experience through helping nonprofits|date=2017-07-31|work=NewsOK.com|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Curriculum ==
The self-paced curriculum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencebradford/2016/12/08/11-websites-to-learn-to-code-for-free-in-2017/#1cdf00b77892|title=11 Websites To Learn To Code For Free In 2017|last=Bradford|first=Laurence|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves 1,200 hours of interactive coding challenges and web development projects, plus 800 hours of contributing to [[open-source]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Michael D. [https://medium.freecodecamp.org/open-source-for-good-1a0ea9f32d5a#.uluo4a1 "Open Source for Good"], retrieved 2017-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; projects for nonprofits and is constantly expanded by more challenges and projects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This translates into about one year of full-time coding. The curriculum is divided into [[Front-end web development|front-end development]], [[data visualization]], back-end development, and full-stack development. Participants receive a certificate after completing each section.

The curriculum emphasizes [[pair programming]], intended to foster a culture of collaboration and shared learning, which can overcome a student's doubts about the adequacy of their skills (popularly referred to as “[[impostor syndrome]]”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=You Can Do Real-World Work at This Free Coding Boot Camp |first=Klint |last=Finley |newspaper=Wired |date=June 18, 2015 |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/06/can-real-world-work-free-coding-boot-camp/ |accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The languages and technologies currently taught by freeCodeCamp include [[HTML5]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS 3]], [[JavaScript]], [[jQuery]], [[Bootstrap (front-end framework)|Bootstrap]], Sass, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and [[Git]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.freecodecamp.org/map freeCodeCamp's map of challenges], retrieved 2017-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nonprofit work ==
As students of freeCodeCamp finish all certificates of the curriculum, they get the opportunity to work with [[nonprofit organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/7-more-places-to-learn-to-code-for-free.html|title=7 (More) Places to Learn to Code for Free|date=2015-06-24|newspaper=Inc.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples have been Indonesia-based nonprofit [[Kopernik (organization)|Kopernik]]&lt;ref name="recruiter"&gt;[https://www.recruiter.com/i/employers-are-crowdsourcing-coding-heres-why/ "Employers Are Crowdsourcing Coding: Here’s Why"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4936">[[File:Hukseflux radiationmeasurement sbg01 photo.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Schmidt Boelter gauge, model SBG01. Clearly visible are the metal body, black sensor, water cooling pipes, mounting flange, and cable. Dimensions: diameter housing is 25mm.]]

A '''Gardon gauge''' or '''Circular-foil gauge''' is a [[heat flux sensor]] primarily intended for the measurement of high intensity radiation. It is a sensor that is designed to measure the radiation [[flux density]] (in watts per metre squared) from a [[field of view]] of 180 degrees. 
The most common application of Gardon gauges is in exposure testing of sample materials for their [[Fireproofing|resistance to fire]] and flames.

== Explanation ==
While heat flux sensors can be made according to various designs, the sensor of a Gardon gauge consists of a foil connected to the sensor body at its external radius, and connected to a thin wire at the center, named after its originator Robert Gardon.&lt;ref&gt;R.Gardon, "An instrument for the direct measurement of intense thermal radiation", Rev. Sci. Instrum., 24, 366-370, 1953.
&lt;/ref&gt; The foil center and side are the hot- and cold joint of a [[thermocouple]] respectively. When radiation hits the sensor this generates a signal. It is typically water-cooled and does not require any power to operate.
A so-called Schmidt-Boelter Gauge has the same outward appearance as a Gardon Gauge, but employs different sensor technology. The Schmidt-Boelter has a plated [[constantan]] wire wrapped around an insulating chip.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Kidd and C.G. Nelson, "How the Schmidt-Boelter gage really works," Proc. 41st Int. Instrum. Symp., [[Research Triangle Park]], NC: ISA, 1995, 347-368.&lt;/ref&gt; Both are heat flux sensors. The only difference is practical; Gardon gauges can be manufactured in such a way that they withstand extremely high flux levels. The range for Schmidt-Boelter technology is more limited. On the other hand the Schmidt-Boelter technology can reach higher sensitivities at a lower response time.
Please note: Images on this page are of a Schmidt-Boelter gauge.  While of similar appearance externally, the internal construction is not that of a Gardon gauge.  Construction of both is detailed in the explanation. 

[[Image:Sbg0x assembly v03.png|thumb|left|400px|Cross section of a Schmidt Boelter gauge showing the instrument main components: metal body, black sensor, water cooling pipe in and out, mounting flange, and cable. Dimensions: diameter housing is 25mm. Drawing shows model SBG01.]]

A high intensity radiation [[spectrum]] extends approximately from 300 to 2,800&amp;nbsp;nm.  Gardon gauges usually cover that spectrum with a spectral sensitivity that is as “flat” as possible.

For a [[flux density]] or [[irradiance]] measurement it is required by definition that the response to “beam” radiation varies with the [[cosine]] of the angle of incidence; i.e. full response at when the radiation hits the sensor perpendicularly (normal to the surface, 0 degrees angle of incidence), zero response when the radiation is at the horizon (90 degrees angle of incidence, 90 degrees zenith angle), and 0.5 at 60 degrees angle of incidence. It follows from the definition that a Gardon gauge should have a so-called “directional response” or “cosine response” that is close to the ideal cosine characteristic.

== Design of gardon gauges ==
In order to attain the proper directional and spectral characteristics, a Gardon gauge’s main components are:

*A [[thermocouple]] sensor with a black coating. This sensor absorbs all radiation, has a flat spectrum covering the 300 to 50,000 nanometer range, and has a near-perfect cosine response.

The black coating on the thermopile sensor absorbs the radiation that is converted to heat. The heat flows through the sensor to the sensor housing and from the housing to the cooling water. The thermopile sensor generates a voltage output signal that is proportional to the heat flux.

== Usage ==
Gardon Gauges are frequently used in [[fire testing]]. Typically installed vertically and next to the sample under testing.
Gardon- or Schmidt Boelter gauges are unprotected heat flux sensors, and that they are highly sensitive to local [[convection]]. In general users should make sure that:
 
# Radiation is dominant, which is generally the case above 50&amp;nbsp;kW per square meter
# Convection is not carrying away too much of the flux; this may happen at high air speeds or in case the sensor temperature and air temperature are very different (so air temperatures above 500°C

== Standardisation ==
Gardon Gauges are standardised according to the [[ASTM]] standard.

Calibration is typically done relative to [[NIST]] .

'''Frederic Gordon Foster''' (24 February 1921 – 20 December 2010)&lt;ref name=IrishTimes/&gt; was an [[Irish people|Irish]] computational engineer, statistician, professor, and college dean who is widely known for devising, in 1965, a nine-digit code upon which the [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN) is based.&lt;ref name="IrishTimes"&gt;[http://johnl.org/files/2011/11/Gordon-Foster-Obituary.pdf "Pioneering Figure in the Worlds of Informatics and Computing"]. ''[[The Irish Times]]''. 26 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Foster was born in [[Belfast]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], between 1920 enactment and 1921 implementation of the [[partition of Ireland]]. He studied at the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]] and began advanced study in mathematics at [[Queen's University Belfast]]. During [[World War II]], he was recruited from Queen's by [[MI6]] to work as a code-breaker at [[Bletchley Park]].

After the war he resumed studies at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. A lecture on feedback control by [[Norbert Wiener]], regarded as the originator of [[cybernetics]], proved to be a great influence on Foster's 
research.  Upon completing his [[PhD]] at Magdalen, he accepted an offer to lecture on his research at the [[University of Manchester]], where he met [[Alan Turing]], a [[Bletchley Park]] veteran who became known as the father of [[computer science]]. Turing introduced him to the ''[[Manchester Mark I]]'' computer and enlisted his help working on it. In 1952 Foster joined the faculty of the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), first as an assistant lecturer in statistics, then lecturer and reader. In 1964, he was appointed to the chair of computational methods. While at LSE he helped develop [[operations research]] as an academic discipline.

Foster became professor of statistics at [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1967. There he flourished, promoting statistical analysis and computer applications in several constituent schools and [[academic departments]]. He also developed his own department, with a strong postgraduate as well as undergraduate program, and set up the statistics and operations research laboratory, known for outreach to industry and public services. Eventually he was Dean of Engineering and System Sciences.&lt;ref name="IrishTimes" /&gt;

Foster died in Dublin, 20 December 2010.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes/&gt;

A '''harvester''' is a type of heavy [[forestry vehicle]] employed in [[cut-to-length logging]] operations for [[tree felling|felling]], [[delimbing]] and [[log bucking|bucking]] [[trees]]. A forest harvester is typically employed together with a [[forwarder]] that hauls the [[logging|logs]] to a roadside landing.

== History ==
Forest harvesters were mainly developed in [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] and today do practically all of the commercial felling in these countries. The first fully mobile timber "harvester", the PIKA model 75, was introduced in 1973&lt;ref name="haarlaa"&gt;Rihko Haarlaa: ''[http://www.fao.org/docrep/w2809E/w2809e06.htm Organization and technology of wood harvesting in Finland.]'' Department of Forest Resource Management, University of Helsinki, Finland. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; by Finnish systems engineer [[Sakari Pinomäki]] and his company PIKA Forest Machines. The first single grip harvester head was introduced in the early 1980s by Swedish company SP Maskiner. Their use has become widespread throughout the rest of Northern Europe, particularly in the [[Logging|harvesting]] of [[plantation]] forests.

Before modern harvesters were developed in Finland and Sweden, two inventors from Texas developed a crude tracked unit that sheared off trees at the base up to {{convert|30|inch|meter|order=flip}} in diameter was developed in the US called The Mammoth Tree Shears.   After shearing off the tree, the operator could use his controls to cause the tree to fall either to the right or left.  Unlike a harvester, it did not delimb the tree after felling it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TCEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UY3MTsHTAsyltwfyz5xa&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAzhG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Paul Bunyan Scissors."] ''Popular Science'', July 1946, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Harvesters are employed effectively in level to moderately steep terrain for [[clearfelling|clearcutting]] areas of forest. For very steep hills or for removing individual trees, humans working with [[chain saw]]s are still preferred in some countries. In northern Europe small and manoeuvrable harvesters are used for [[thinning]] operations, manual felling is typically only used in extreme conditions, where tree size exceeds the capacity of the harvester head or by small woodlot owners.

The principle aimed for in mechanised logging is "no feet on the forest floor", and the harvester and forwarder allow this to be achieved. Keeping humans inside the driving cab of the machine provides a safer and more comfortable working environment for industrial scale logging.

Harvesters are built on a robust all terrain vehicle, either [[wheel]]ed, [[Continuous track|tracked]] or on [[Walking Excavator]]. The vehicle may be articulated to provide tight turning capability around obstacles. A [[diesel engine]] provides power for both the vehicle and the harvesting mechanism through [[hydraulic machinery|hydraulic drive]]. An extensible, articulated boom, similar to that on an [[excavator]], reaches out from the vehicle to carry the harvester head. Some harvesters are adaptations of excavators with a new harvester head, while others are purpose-built vehicles.

"Combi" machines are available which combine the felling capability of a harvester with the load-carrying capability of a forwarder, allowing a single operator and machine to fell, process and transport trees. These novel type of vehicles are only competitive in operations with short distances to the landing.

== Felling head ==
[[File:Harvester hf.jpg|thumb|upright|Harvester head]]
[[File:Harvester cutter.JPG|thumb|Harvester head, [[chainsaw]] visible]]
A typical harvester head consists of (from bottom to top, with head in vertical position)
* a [[chain saw]] to cut the tree at its base, and cut it to length. The saw is hydraulically powered, rather than using the [[two-stroke cycle|2-stroke engine]] of a portable version. It has a stronger chain and a higher power output than any saw a person can carry.
* two or more curved delimbing knives which reach around the trunk to remove branches.
* two feed rollers to grasp the tree. The wheels pivot apart to allow the harvester head to grasp the tree and pivot together to hug the tree tightly. The wheels are driven in rotation to force the cut tree stem through the delimbing knives.
* diameter sensors to calculate the volume of timber harvested in conjunction with
* a measuring wheel which measures the length of the stem as it is fed through the head.

One operator in the vehicle's cab can control all of these functions. A [[Programmable logic controller|control computer]] can simplify mechanical movements and can keep records of the length and diameter of trees cut. Length is computed by either counting the rotations of the gripping wheels or, more commonly, using the measuring wheel. Diameter is computed from the pivot angle of the gripping wheels or delimbing knives when hugging the tree. Length measurement also can be used for automated cutting of the tree into predefined lengths. Computer software can predict the volume of each stem based on analysing stems harvested previously. This information when used in conjunction with price lists for each specific log specification enables the optimisation of log recovery from the stem.

Harvesters are routinely available for cutting trees up to {{convert|900|mm}} in diameter, built on vehicles weighing up to {{convert|20|MT}}, with a boom reaching up to {{convert|10|m}} radius. Larger, heavier vehicles do more damage to the forest floor, but a longer reach helps by allowing harvesting of more trees with fewer vehicle movements.

The approximate equivalent type of vehicle in [[full-tree logging]] systems are [[feller-buncher]]s.

'''Hydrodesulfurization''' ('''HDS''') is a [[catalytic]] chemical process widely used to remove [[sulfur]] (S) from [[natural gas]] and from [[oil refinery|refined petroleum products]], such as [[gasoline|gasoline or petrol]], [[jet fuel]], [[kerosene]], [[diesel fuel]], and [[fuel oil]]s.&lt;ref name=Gary&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary, J.H.  |author2=Handwerk, G.E.|title=Petroleum Refining Technology and Economics|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Marcel Dekker, Inc]]|year=1984|isbn=0-8247-7150-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theicct.org/documents/Yamaguchi_Mexico_2003.pdf ''Hydrodesulfurization Technologies and Costs''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013034257/http://www.theicct.org/documents/Yamaguchi_Mexico_2003.pdf |date=2006-10-13 }} Nancy Yamaguchi, Trans Energy Associates, [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]] Sulfur Workshop, Mexico City, May 29–30, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of removing the sulfur, and creating products such as [[ultra-low-sulfur diesel]], is to reduce the [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|SO|2}}) emissions that result from using those fuels in automotive [[vehicles]], [[aircraft]], railroad [[locomotives]], [[ships]], gas or oil burning [[Fossil-fuel power station|power plants]], residential and industrial [[furnaces]], and other forms of fuel [[combustion]].

Another important reason for removing sulfur from the [[Petroleum naphtha|naphtha]] streams within a [[petroleum refinery]] is that sulfur, even in extremely low concentrations, [[catalyst poisoning|poisons]] the [[noble metal]] catalysts ([[platinum]] and [[rhenium]]) in the [[catalytic reforming]] units that are subsequently used to upgrade the [[octane rating]] of the naphtha streams.

The industrial hydrodesulfurization processes include facilities for the capture and removal of the resulting [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}) gas. In [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], the hydrogen sulfide gas is then subsequently converted into byproduct [[Sulfur|elemental sulfur]] or [[sulfuric acid]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}). In fact, the vast majority of the 64,000,000 metric tons of sulfur produced worldwide in 2005 was byproduct sulfur from refineries and other hydrocarbon processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/sulfur/sulfumcs06.pdf Sulfur production report] by the [[United States Geological Survey]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/july03/resources.html Discussion of recovered byproduct sulfur]&lt;/ref&gt;

An HDS unit in the petroleum refining industry is also often referred to as a '''hydrotreater'''.

==History==
Although some reactions involving catalytic hydrogenation of organic substances were already known, the property of finely divided nickel to catalyze the fixation of hydrogen on hydrocarbon ([[ethylene]], [[benzene]]) [[double bond]]s was discovered by the French [[chemist]] [[Paul Sabatier (chemist)|Paul Sabatier]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;C.R.Acad.Sci. 1897, 132, 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.R.Acad.Sci. 1901, 132, 210&lt;/ref&gt; 
Through this work, he found that [[unsaturated hydrocarbons]] in the vapor phase could be converted into [[saturated hydrocarbons]] by using hydrogen and a catalytic metal, laying the foundation of the modern catalytic hydrogenation process.

Soon after Sabatier's work, a German chemist, [[Wilhelm Normann]], found that catalytic hydrogenation could be used to convert unsaturated [[fatty acids]] or [[glycerides]] in the liquid phase into saturated ones. He was awarded a patent in Germany in 1902&lt;ref&gt;[http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=DE141029&amp;F=0 DE Patent DE141029 (Espacenet, record not available)]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Britain in 1903,&lt;ref&gt;[http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=GB190301515&amp;F=0 UK Patent GB190301515 GB190301515 (Espacenet)]&lt;/ref&gt; which was the beginning of what is now a worldwide industry.

In the mid-1950s, the first [[noble metal]] catalytic reforming process (the [[catalytic reforming|Platformer process]]) was commercialized. At the same time, the catalytic hydrodesulfurization of the naphtha feed to such reformers was also commercialized. In the decades that followed, various proprietary catalytic hydrodesulfurization processes, such as the one depicted in the [[Process flow diagram|flow diagram]] below, have been commercialized. Currently, virtually all of the petroleum refineries worldwide have one or more HDS units.

By 2006, miniature [[microfluidic]] HDS units had been implemented for treating [[JP-8]] jet fuel to produce clean feed stock for a [[fuel cell]] [[hydrogen reformer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2006/03/microchannel_de.html Microchannel HDS (March 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2007, this had been integrated into an operating 5&amp;nbsp;kW fuel cell generation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnl.gov/topstory.asp?id=282 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215111008/http://www.pnl.gov/topstory.asp?id=282 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 Dec 2007 |title=Fuel cells help make noisy, hot generators a thing of the past |publisher=Pacific Northwest National Laboratory }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process chemistry==
[[Hydrogenation]] is a class of [[chemical reactions]] in which the net result is the addition of [[hydrogen]] (H). [[Hydrogenolysis]] is a type of hydrogenation and results in the cleavage of the C-X [[chemical bond]], where C is a [[carbon]] atom and X is a sulfur (S), [[nitrogen]] (N) or [[oxygen]] (O) atom. The net result of a hydrogenolysis reaction is the formation of C-H and H-X chemical bonds. Thus, hydrodesulfurization is a hydrogenolysis reaction. Using [[ethanethiol]] ({{chem|C|2|H|5|SH}}), a sulfur compound present in some petroleum products, as an example, the hydrodesulfurization reaction can be simply expressed as 

: &lt;chem&gt;\overset{Ethanethiol}{C2H5SH} + \overset{Hydrogen}{H2}
-&gt;
\overset{Ethane}{C2H6} + \overset{Hydrogen\ sulfide}{H2S}&lt;/chem&gt;
For the mechanistic aspects of, and the catalysts used in this reaction see the section [[#Catalysts and mechanisms|catalysts and mechanisms]].

==Process description==
In an industrial hydrodesulfurization unit, such as in a refinery, the hydrodesulfurization reaction takes place in a fixed-bed [[chemical reactor|reactor]] at elevated [[temperatures]] ranging from 300 to 400&amp;nbsp;°C and elevated [[pressures]] ranging from 30 to 130 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]s of absolute pressure, typically in the presence of a [[catalyst]] consisting of an [[alumina]] base impregnated with [[cobalt]] and [[molybdenum]] (usually called a CoMo catalyst).  Occasionally, a combination of [[nickel]] and [[molybdenum]] (called NiMo) is used, in addition to the CoMo catalyst, for specific difficult-to-treat feed stocks, such as those containing a high level of chemically bound nitrogen.

The image below is a schematic depiction of the equipment and the process flow streams in a typical refinery HDS unit.
[[Image:HDS Flow.png|frame|center|Schematic diagram of a typical Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) unit in a petroleum refinery]]

The liquid feed (at the bottom left in the diagram) is pumped up to the required elevated pressure and is joined by a stream of hydrogen-rich recycle gas. The resulting liquid-gas mixture is preheated by flowing through a [[heat exchanger]]. The preheated feed then flows through a [[furnace|fired heater]] where the feed mixture is totally [[vaporized]] and heated to the required elevated temperature before entering the reactor and flowing through a fixed-bed of catalyst where the hydrodesulfurization reaction takes place.

The hot reaction products are partially cooled by flowing through the heat exchanger where the reactor feed was preheated and then flows through a water-cooled heat exchanger before it flows through the pressure controller (PC) and undergoes a pressure reduction down to about 3 to 5 atmospheres.  The resulting mixture of liquid and gas enters the gas separator [[pressure vessel|vessel]] at about 35&amp;nbsp;°C and 3 to 5 atmospheres of absolute pressure.

Most of the hydrogen-rich gas from the gas separator vessel is recycle gas, which is routed through an [[amine gas treating|amine contactor]] for removal of the reaction product {{chem|H|2|S}} that it contains. The {{chem|H|2|S}}-free hydrogen-rich gas is then recycled back for reuse in the reactor section. Any excess gas from the gas separator vessel joins the [[sour gas]] from the stripping of the reaction product liquid.

The liquid from the gas separator vessel is routed through a [[reboiler|reboiled]] stripper [[Continuous distillation|distillation]] tower.  The bottoms product from the stripper is the final desulfurized liquid product from hydrodesulfurization unit.

The overhead sour gas from the stripper contains hydrogen, [[methane]], [[ethane]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[propane]], and, perhaps, some [[butane]] and heavier components. That sour gas is sent to the refinery's central gas processing plant for removal of the hydrogen sulfide in the refinery's main [[amine gas treating]] unit and through a series of distillation towers for recovery of propane, butane and [[pentane]] or heavier components. The residual hydrogen, methane, ethane, and some propane is used as refinery fuel gas. The hydrogen sulfide removed and recovered by the amine gas treating unit is subsequently converted to elemental sulfur in a [[Claus process]] unit or to sulfuric acid in a [[wet sulfuric acid process]] or in the conventional [[Contact Process]].

Note that the above description assumes that the HDS unit feed contains no [[olefins]].  If the feed does contain olefins (for example, the feed is a naphtha derived from a refinery fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) unit), then the overhead gas from the HDS stripper may also contain some [[ethene]], [[propene]], [[butenes]] and [[pentenes]], or heavier components.

It should also be noted that the amine solution to and from the recycle gas contactor comes from and is returned to the refinery's main amine gas treating unit.

==Sulfur compounds in refinery HDS feedstocks==
The refinery HDS feedstocks (naphtha, kerosene, diesel oil, and heavier oils) contain a wide range of [[Organic compound|organic]] sulfur compounds, including [[thiols]], [[thiophenes]], organic [[sulfides]] and [[disulfides]], and many others. These organic sulfur compounds are products of the degradation of sulfur containing biological components, present during the natural formation of the [[fossil fuel]], petroleum crude oil.

When the HDS process is used to desulfurize a refinery naphtha, it is necessary to remove the total sulfur down to the parts per million range or lower in order to prevent poisoning the noble metal catalysts in the subsequent catalytic reforming of the naphthas.

When the process is used for desulfurizing diesel oils, the latest environmental regulations in the United States and Europe, requiring  what is referred to as ''[[ultra-low-sulfur diesel]]'' (ULSD), in turn requires that very deep hydrodesulfurization is needed. In the very early 2000s, the governmental regulatory limits for highway vehicle diesel was within the range of 300 to 500 ppm by weight of total sulfur. As of 2006, the total sulfur limit for highway diesel is in the range of 15 to 30 ppm by weight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npradc.org/issues/fuels/diesel_sulfur.cfm ''Diesel Sulfur''] published online by the National Petrochemical &amp; Refiners Association (NPRA)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thiophenes===
A family of substrates that are particularly common in petroleum are the aromatic sulfur-containing heterocycles called [[thiophenes]].  Many kinds of thiophenes occur in petroleum ranging from thiophene itself to more condensed derivatives called [[benzothiophene]]s and [[dibenzothiophene]]s.  [[Thiophene]] itself and its alkyl derivatives are easier to hydrogenolyse, whereas dibenzothiophene, especially its 4,6-disubstituted derivatives, are considered the most challenging substrates.  Benzothiophenes are midway between the simple thiophenes and dibenzothiophenes in their susceptibility to HDS.

==Catalysts and mechanisms==
The main HDS catalysts are based on [[molybdenum disulfide]] ({{chem|MoS|2}}) together with smaller amounts of other metals.&lt;ref&gt;Topsøe, H.; Clausen, B. S.; Massoth, F. E., Hydrotreating Catalysis, Science and Technology, Springer-Verlag: Berlin, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  The nature of the sites of catalytic activity remains an active area of investigation, but it is generally assumed [[basal plane]]s of the {{chem|MoS|2}} structure are not relevant to catalysis, rather the edges or rims of these sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Daage, M.; Chianelli, R. R., "Structure-Function Relations in Molybdenum Sulfide Catalysts - the Rim-Edge Model", J. of Catalysis, 1994, 149, 414-427.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the edges of the {{chem|MoS|2}} crystallites, the molybdenum centre can stabilize a coordinatively unsaturated site (CUS), also known as an anion vacancy.  Substrates, such as thiophene, bind to this site and undergo a series of reactions that result in both C-S scission and C=C hydrogenation.  Thus, the hydrogen serves multiple roles—generation of anion vacancy by removal of sulfide, hydrogenation, and hydrogenolysis.  A simplified diagram for the cycle is shown:
[[Image:Hydrodesulfurization cycle for thiophene (simplified diagram).png|thumb|450px|center|Simplified diagram of a HDS cycle for thiophene]]

===Catalysts===
Most metals catalyse HDS, but it is those at the middle of the transition metal series that are most active.  [[Ruthenium disulfide]] appears to be the single most active catalyst, but binary combinations of cobalt and molybdenum are also highly active.&lt;ref&gt;Chianelli, R. R.; Berhault, G.; Raybaud, P.; Kasztelan, S.; Hafner, J. and Toulhoat, H., "Periodic trends in hydrodesulfurization: in support of the Sabatier principle", Applied Catalysis, A, 2002, volume 227, pages 83-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from the basic cobalt-modified MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst, nickel and tungsten are also used, depending on the nature of the feed.  For example, Ni-W catalysts are more effective for [[hydrodenitrogenation]].

===Supports===
Metal sulfides are "supported" on materials with high surface areas.  A typical support for HDS catalyst is γ-[[alumina]].  The support allows the more expensive catalyst to be more widely distributed, giving rise to a larger fraction of the {{chem|MoS|2}} that is catalytically active.  The interaction between the support and the catalyst is an area of intense interest, since the support is often not fully inert but participates in the catalysis.

==Other uses==
The basic hydrogenolysis reaction has a number of uses other than hydrodesulfurization.

===Hydrodenitrogenation===
The hydrogenolysis reaction is also used to reduce the nitrogen content of a petroleum stream in a process referred to as [[hydrodenitrogenation]] (HDN). The process flow is the same as that for an HDS unit.

Using [[pyridine]] ({{chem|C|5|H|5|N}}), a nitrogen compound present in some petroleum fractionation products, as an example, the hydrodenitrogenation reaction has been postulated as occurring in three steps:&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/27892/1/03740017.pdf ''Kinetics and Interactions of the Simultaneous Catalytic Hydrodenitrogenation of Pyridine and Hydrodesulfurization of Thiophene''] (John Wilkins, PhD Thesis, [[\overset{}{MIT}]], 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/iepdaw/1980/19/i01/f-pdf/f_i260073a027.pdf?sessid=6006l3 ''Simultaneous Catalytic Hydrodenitrogenation of Pyridine and Hydrodesulfurization of Thiophene''] (Satterfield,C.N., Modell, M. and Wilkens, J.A., Ind. Eng. Chem. Process Des. Dev., 1980 Vol. 19, pages 154-160)&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;chem&gt;\overset{Pyridine}{C5H5N} + \overset{Hydrogen}{5H2} -&gt; \overset{Piperdine}{C5H11N} + \overset{Hydrogen}{2H2} -&gt; \overset{Amylamine}{C5H11NH2} + \overset{Hydrogen}{H2} -&gt; \overset{Pentane}{C5H12} + \overset{Ammonia}{NH3}&lt;/chem&gt;
and the overall reaction may be simply expressed as:

: &lt;chem&gt;\overset{Pyridine}{C5H5N} + \overset{Hydrogen}{5H2} -&gt; \overset{Pentane}{C5H12} + \overset{Ammonia}{NH3}&lt;/chem&gt;
Many HDS units for desulfurizing naphthas within petroleum refineries are actually simultaneously denitrogenating to some extent as well.

===Saturation of olefins===
The hydrogenolysis reaction may also be used to [[saturation (chemistry)|saturate]] or convert [[olefins]] ([[alkenes]]) into [[Alkane|paraffins]] ([[alkanes]]).  The process used is the same as for an HDS unit.

As an example, the saturation of the olefin pentene can be simply expressed as:
: &lt;chem&gt;\overset{Pentene}{C5H10} + \overset{Hydrogen}{H2} -&gt; \overset{Pentane}{C5H12}&lt;/chem&gt;
Some hydrogenolysis units within a petroleum refinery or a petrochemical plant may be used solely for the saturation of olefins or they may be used for simultaneously desulfurizing as well as denitrogenating and saturating olefins to some extent.

===Hydrogenation in the food industry===
{{further|Hydrogenation|Wilhelm Normann|Trans fat}}
The food industry uses hydrogenation to completely or partially [[saturated fat|saturate]] the [[unsaturated fat|unsaturated]] [[fatty acids]] in liquid [[vegetable fats and oils]] to convert them into solid or semi-solid fats, such as those in [[margarine]] and [[shortening]].

'''XMX1100 Scorpion: Intelligent Munitions System''' ('''IMS''') is a [[smart system]] being developed by [[Textron Defense Systems|Textron]] and the [[US Army|U.S. Army]] TACOM-ARDEC [[Picatinny Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.textrondefense.com/products/smart-weapons-ground/scorpion/index.php | title = Textron Defense Systems: XMX1100 Scorpion | accessdate = 2012-02-14 | author = Textron Defense Systems | date = 2011 | publisher = [[Textron]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IMS allows for controlled and safe use of munitions in the battlefield and prevents unwanted munitions from being buried and forgotten. It is remotely operated and can be left in the field on an automatic mode or turned off to allow friendly vehicles to pass through.  Each module contains four anti-vehicle smart munitions that are fired into the air and release a guided warhead that will descend vertically on the target.

'''''James May's Man Lab''''' is a [[television in the United Kingdom|British television]] series presented by former [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]] presenter [[James May]]. The first, three-part series was aired on [[BBC Two]] between 31 October and 14 November 2010. The second, five-part series was aired between 25 October and 18 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=jamesmaysmanlab|author=James May's Man Lab|number=125867929853100032|date=17 October 2011|title=Started work editing the Christmas Ep. James May and Oz Clarke cook the perfect man Xmas dinner with interesting results!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeats of Series 2 continued on late night [[BBC One]] with signing for the deaf throughout January 2012.

Series 3 began broadcasting in March 2013, after James May's other co-hosted TV show (''Top Gear'') finished [[Top Gear (series 19)|Series 19]]. Series One was released on DVD on 7 November 2011 by [[Acorn Media UK]],&lt;ref name="James May's Man Lab Series One"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0057OGPB2 |title=James May's Man Lab Series One |publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]]|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Series Two on 8 October 2012.&lt;ref name="James May's Man Lab Series Two"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/James-Mays-Man-Lab-Two/dp/B005ZPM9ZE/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324283041&amp;sr=1-1|title=James May's Man Lab Series Two|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]]|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premise ==
The series explores traditional skills that are being lost by the modern man, and shows how to stop them from being lost forever. Each episode has a variety of themed tasks, including construction, seduction, destruction and more. If science, geometry, maths, logic and explosives can be used in these tasks, so much the better. Tasks include sending a dead pet's ashes into space using a homemade [[balloon (aircraft)|hydrogen balloon]], creating one's own smelting furnace, constructing a [[billiard table|pool table]], felling a tree using explosives, escaping from [[HM Prison Dartmoor|Dartmoor prison]] whilst avoiding detection from expert trackers and making a magnetic ceiling panel to throw your keys at so you don't lose them.

The first series also had a celebrity man task, where a celebrity attempted to beat a personal best at a certain 'man task', such as changing a [[tyre (wheel)|tyre]]; however, this aspect was not continued into series two. The theme tune was written by May himself and is often played live over the end credits by a variety of different performers, including barber shop quartet, bagpipes and more.

The Danish Carbon Fund's (DCF) &lt;ref&gt;[http://wbcarbonfinance.org/Router.cfm?Page=Projport&amp;ProjID=43057 CFU World Bank: Lahore Composting Project]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lahore Composting Facility''' project is the first of its kind in [[Pakistan]]. It is bringing [[compost]]ing technology to a country where the common practice is by [[open dump]]ing of waste, as there are no [[landfill]]s. This project is the first public-private partnership project in Pakistan on a large scale in the area of [[Municipal Solid Waste]] Management (MSW). 


It will contribute towards the sustainable development of the municipality of [[Lahore]], as well as significantly reduce health hazards for the local communities. It was set up at Mehmood Booti under an agreement with the City District Government of [[Lahore]] (CDGL). The project is expected to generate over 310,000 tons of [[CO2e]] by 2018.

==Reasoning behind the facility==
The rapid increase of population, high rates of [[Human migration|migration]] towards cities, as well as the introduction of disposable items, such as plastic bags and bottles have created serious environmental problems including: inadequate solid and liquid [[waste management]], lack of safe water and minimal [[pollution]] control. Similar to other big cities of Pakistan, Lahore is witnessing a rapid growth in its population due to rural-urban migration from the surrounding areas and other parts of the country. Lahore has a population of around 10 million and is considered to be one of the 30 largest cities in the world. 
[[File:OPEN DUMP - NARA - 544799.jpg|thumb|Open dumping carries serious environmental effects]]

The increase in population has exerted immense pressure on the social and physical [[infrastructure]] of the city, leading to various socio-economic and environmental problems. Inadequate solid waste management is one of the most visible and pressing problems in the city, contributing to an unattractive environment, poor [[sanitation]], [[disease]], pollution of water bodies and general environmental degradation. Due to its high population growth and the lack of resources, waste management has become a challenge for the city. This project addresses the need to dispose of solid waste in economically beneficial ways without putting an extra burden on the infrastructure of Lahore city .

===Addressing the lack of facilities===
The country has no scientifically designed landfill and the common practice is for the open dumping of waste. LCL has leased the Mehmood Booti dumping site from CDGL as well as receiving a concession from it to process 1,000 tons per day (tpd) of MSW collected from residential areas, as well as from the city's fruit and vegetable markets. LCL has imported [[Belgium|Belgian]] machinery and composting technology. LCL has created local compost management know-how through the practice of learning by doing, which did not exist previously. Composting in a scientifically designed plant will improve the local environment, reducing the health hazards created by the present practices of dumping waste in open sites. It will also sequester the emission of [[methane]] gas generated in the process of [[anaerobic decomposition]] of the [[biodegradation|bio-degradable]] matter. the project will also lengthen the usable life of the dump site in a city where land is running short and its costs are at a premium. The compost that is produced will be used as a soil conditioner/[[fertilizer]] for improving the quality of the soil in and around Lahore.
[[File:Composting.png|thumb|All manner of vegetable waste can be used from markets]]

==Addressing various issues==
Declining land yields and soil [[erosion]] are big large problems in Pakistan, especially for an [[Agriculture|agriculturally]] based country. This is exacerbated by the fact that Pakistan has been estimated to be one of the 12 hardest hit countries by [[climate change]], the highest impact being on agriculture and [[flooding]]s. The Lahore Compost project is not only a pilot for better a MSW in the country, but also represents a potential solution for badly degraded agricultural lands. Compost application pilots are already showing positive effects in reducing land [[salinity]], which is a big problem in Pakistan. In addition, land yields and the size of agricultural products produced have been shown to increase dramatically with the first application of compost to degraded soils. In addition to selling [[Certified Emission Reduction]] (CER), the project must also create a market for compost in the country.

===Added benefits===
In addition to mitigating climate change, LCL has created jobs through this project. It has implemented free [[vaccination]]s for its workers, showers where they can wash after work, introduced safety measures like the mandatory use of safety [[boots]] and [[gloves]] and it is working on creating an education program through its project. Forecast CDM revenues are expected to encourage the development of a market for compost in Pakistan, where it has not yet been operating on a larger scale. Lahore Compost will demonstrate the viability of such an initiative and encourage the [[private sector]]s participation in similar MSW projects, which will help contribute towards the sustainable development of other municipalities in Pakistan.

'''Limbo''', or '''Anti Submarine Mortar Mark 10''' (A/S Mk.10), was the final British development of a forward-throwing [[submarine|anti-submarine]] weapon originally designed during the [[Second World War]]. Limbo, a three-barreled mortar similar to the earlier [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] and [[Squid (weapon)|Squid]] which it superseded, was developed by the [[Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment]] in the 1950s. Squid was loaded manually, which was difficult on a pitching deck in heavy seas with no protection from the elements; in contrast Limbo was loaded and fired automatically, with all the crew under cover. It was widely fitted on the [[quarterdeck]] of [[Royal Navy]] escort ships on a mounting stabilised for pitch and roll from 1955 to the mid&amp;ndash;1980s. Australian built versions of the {{sclass-|Daring|destroyer (1949)|0}} [[destroyer]] all carried Limbo as did the Australian {{sclass2-|River|destroyer escort}}. Limbo was also widely employed by the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], being incorporated into all destroyer designs from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, including the {{sclass-|St. Laurent|destroyer|5}}, {{sclass-|Restigouche|destroyer|5}}, {{sclass-|Mackenzie|destroyer|5}}, {{sclass-|Annapolis|destroyer|5}} and {{sclass-|Iroquois|destroyer|5}} classes.

The firing distance of the mortars was controlled by opening gas vents; rounds could be fired from {{convert|400|-|1000|yd|m}}. The weapon was linked to the [[sonar]] system of the ship, firing on command when the target was in range. The rounds were projected so that they fell in a triangular pattern around the target. Limbo could fire in any direction around the ship and is reported{{By whom|date=April 2011}} to have been very accurate. The weapon was used in the 1982 [[Falklands War]], and remained in service in the Royal Navy and Commonwealth navies until the 1990s. A surviving system is preserved at [[Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower]] in Gosport, Hampshire.

==Sonar control of the A/S Mortar Mk 10==

The firing of the Mortar Mk 10 was controlled by the Type 170 (and later the 502) attack sonar from the Sonar Control Room (SCR), which was generally located next to the operations room in the warship.

The 170 sonar had 3 operators who maintained sonar contact with the target and effectively aimed the weapon in bearing, range and depth.  The operators were controlled by the SC (Sonar Controller) who was in charge of the SCR.

When a contact had been confirmed as a hostile submarine, the SC manually fired the Mortar Mk 10 from the SCR upon receiving the order from the captain in the operations room.  The firing was done by means of a pistol grip and trigger mounted to the [[deckhead]] immediately behind the operators.

==General characteristics==

This is a '''list of firsts in [[aviation]]'''.

==The forerunners==

===First alleged human flights===
* In the year 559, several prisoners of [[Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi]], including [[Yuan Huangtou]] of [[Ye, China|Ye]], were forced to launch themselves from a tower attached to a kite, as an experiment. Yuan Huangtou was the sole survivor, successfully gliding over the city walls. He was later executed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zizhi Tongjian]] 167. "（永定三年）使元黄头与诸囚自金凤台各乘纸鸱以飞，黄头独能至紫陌乃堕，仍付御史中丞毕义云饿杀之。" (Rendering: In the 3rd year of Yongding, 559, Gao Yang conducted an experiment by having Yuan Huangtou and a few prisoners launch themselves from a tower in Ye, capital of the Northern Qi. Yuan Huangtou was the only one who survived from this flight, as he glided over the city-wall and fell at Zimo [western segment of Ye] safely, but he was later executed.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Abbas Ibn Firnas]] (810–887), a Muslim [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] polymath, is rumored to have made a successful attempt at flying, according to the account of the historian Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari seven centuries later. He built his own glider, and launched himself from a mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hitti |first=Philip Khuri |authorlink=Philip Khuri Hitti |title=History of the Arabs, Revised: 10th Edition |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=September 6, 2002 |isbn=978-0-333-63142-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the early 11th century (possibly first decade), [[Eilmer of Malmesbury]], an English Benedictine monk, attempted a gliding flight using wings. According to the ''Gesta Regum Anglorum'', Eilmer travelled over a furlong (660 feet, 201&amp;nbsp;metres) through the air before falling and breaking both his legs, rendering him lame for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;William of Malmesbury – ed. and trans. R. A. B. Mynors, R. M. Thomson, and M. Winterbottom (1998-9). ''Gesta regum Anglorum / The history of the English kings''. Oxford Medieval Texts.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hezarfen Ahmed Celebi]], unpowered [[gliding flight]] over the [[Bosphorus]] strait from the [[Galata Tower]] to [[Uskudar]] district in [[Istanbul]] between 1630–1632.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmistanbulbogazici.com/who-is-hezarfen-ahmet-celebi/ Who is Hezarfen Ahmet Çelebi?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121173615/http://www.cmistanbulbogazici.com/who-is-hezarfen-ahmet-celebi/ |date=2016-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privatetour.net/hezarfen-ahmet-celebi-the-first-man-to-fly Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi "The First Man to Fly"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121173616/http://www.privatetour.net/hezarfen-ahmet-celebi-the-first-man-to-fly |date=2016-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1633, [[Lagari Hasan Çelebi]], brother of [[Hezarfen Ahmed Celebi]] launched in a 7-winged [[rocket]] using 50 [[Oka (mass)|okka]] (140&amp;nbsp;lbs) of [[gunpowder]] from [[Sarayburnu]], the point below [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Frank H. (1992). "Who First Flew in a Rocket?", Journal of the British Interplanetary Society 45 (July 1992), p. 275-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Flying's strangest moments: extraordinary but true stories from over one thousand years of aviation history|first=John|last=Harding|publisher=[[Anova Books|Robson Publishing]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-86105-934-5|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Albrecht Berblinger]] (dubbed [[The Tailor from Ulm]]) is believed to have constructed a primitive hang glider in [[Ulm]], [[Germany]]. Urged to make a public demonstration on May 30, 1811, he failed due to limited thermal updrafts over the cold Danube.

===First recorded lighter-than-air (aerostat) flights===
* '''First recorded manned flight''' [[Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier]] and [[Marquis d'Arlandes]] piloted a [[hot air balloon]] (built by the [[Montgolfier brothers]]) from the [[Château de la Muette]] to the [[Butte-aux-Cailles]], Paris, on November 21, 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brady |first=Tim |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ccymjJZxLcC&amp;pg=PA310 |title=The American Aviation Experience: A History |publisher=SIU Press |page=310 |isbn=978-0-809-32371-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oborne |first=Michael W. |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjSBROnWSywC&amp;pg=PA86 |title=A History of the Château de la Muette |publisher=OECD Publishing |pages=86–7 |isbn=978-9-264-16161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first free manned flight; however, de Rozier had flown in a tethered balloon on October 15, 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ryan |first=Craig |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QS38bu9iTwC&amp;pg=PA37 |title=The Pre-Astronauts: Manned Ballooning on the Threshold of Space |publisher=Naval Institute Press |page=37 |isbn=978-1-591-14748-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morgan Solar, Inc.''' is a Canadian [[solar power]] and [[Optics|optical]] [[technology company]] based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. The company's two main products are the Sun Simba [[Concentrated photovoltaics|concentrated photovoltaic]] (CPV) solar panel&lt;ref name="simba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://morgansolar.com/about-sun-simba |title=About Sun Simba |publisher=morgansolar.com |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Savanna Dual-Axis Tracker.&lt;ref name="savanna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://morgansolar.com/savannapvtracker |title=About Savanna PV Tracker |publisher=morgansolar.com |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

===Sun Simba CPV===
The Sun Simba uses a customized "Light-guide Solar Optic"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://morgansolar.com/how-it-works/ |title=How it works |publisher=morgansolar.com |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/412138/a-cheaper-solar-concentrator/ |title=A Cheaper Solar Concentrator |author=Tyler Hamilton |publisher=technologyreview.com |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to focus light collected over a large surface area on to a relatively small, highly efficient [[solar cell]] for conversion into electricity. Multiple generations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rechargenews.com/solar/article1295258.ece |title=Innovative module promises to make solar energy cheaper than coal and natural gas. |author=Darius Snieckus |publisher=Recharge News |date=2012-02-02 |accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Sun Simba have been developed and deployed at test sites in Ontario and California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apecs.site.uottawa.ca/content/about-us |title=SUNLAB Solar Test site |publisher=University of Ottawa |accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the highest reported active area efficiency of the Sun Simba is 29%,&lt;ref name="simba" /&gt; as compared to the experimental world record efficiency of 44.7% in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130923204214.htm |title=World record solar cell with 44.7% efficiency |publisher=Science Daily |author=Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems |date=2013-09-23 |accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Savanna Dual-Axis Tracker===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Savanna Tracker Small PV Field.jpg|thumb|left|A small field of PV panels on Savanna Trackers.]] --&gt;
The Savanna [[Photovoltaic system|PV]] tracker is designed both to compliment the Sun Simba CPV panel, and to be used as an augmentation to improve the output of standard PV solar panels.&lt;ref name="savanna" /&gt; Solar panels generate the most power when they are directly facing the sun. By using a [[Solar tracker|tracking system]] to keep panels properly aligned, output power production can be significantly increased. The Savanna distinguishes itself from many other trackers on the market in that it is much easier to install, requiring no heavy equipment or specialized infrastructure to be assembled ahead of time.&lt;ref name="savanna" /&gt;

==History==

Morgan Solar was founded in 2007 by brothers John Paul Morgan and Nicolas Morgan as an optical technology company with the goal of achieving solar power generation at costs rivalling traditional energy sources. Since its founding, Morgan Solar has grown to employ over 50 scientists, engineers and business administrators in the [[Greater Toronto Area|GTA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://morgansolar.com/about/ |title=About Morgan Solar |publisher=morgansolar.com |date= |accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of manufacturing experts, test site managers and business developers outside of Canada.

Nathan Sivin has studied abroad on many occasions. From October 1961 to August 1962 he studied Chinese language and philosophy at [[Taipei]] in [[Taiwan]]. From August 1962 to March 1963 he studied the history of Chinese [[alchemy]] in [[Singapore]] and provided guest lectures there. From the 1960s until the 1980s he was an avid visitor to [[Kyoto]] in [[Japan]], where he acted as a visiting professor, studied at the Research Institute of Humanistic Studies, and studied [[Chinese astronomy]], alchemy, and medicine. From 1974 to 2000 he made numerous trips to [[Cambridge]] in order to study Chinese astronomy, visiting [[Gonville and Caius College]], the [[Needham Research Institute]], and St. John's College in the process. From the late 1970s until the late 1990s he traveled several times to the [[People's Republic of China]]. In September 1979 he lectured in seminars at the [[École Pratique des Hautes Etudes]] of [[Paris]], [[France]], and at the Sinologisches Seminar at the [[University of Würzburg]] in [[Germany]] in 1981. Nathan Sivin also speaks several foreign languages, including [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[German language|German]], and [[French language|French]].

Along with various responsibilities at the University of Pennsylvania, throughout his career Nathan Sivin was also an elective member of numerous [[List of learned societies|societies and committees]]. This included the [[American Society for the Study of Religion]], the [[Philomathean Society]], the [[Académie Internationale d'Histoire des Sciences]], the [[T'ang Studies Society]], and many others.

Along with numerous book publications since the 1960s, Nathan Sivin also wrote many more essays from the 1960s onwards. He has also given over 200 lectures throughout [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]], and [[North America]]. He is currently working on several projects, including a biography on the [[Song Dynasty]] [[polymath]] scientist [[Shen Kuo]] and a translation into [[English language|English]] of a [[Yuan Dynasty]] calendrical treatise published in 1279 AD, the ''Season-Granting'' (a hallmark of Chinese mathematical astronomy).

The '''Nintendo DS family''' is a family of [[handheld game console]]s that were developed and sold by [[Nintendo]].

Initially released as an experimental platform ancillary to the then-current [[Game Boy Advance family]], Nintendo DS soon replaced it as Nintendo's flagship handheld device family. The DS was distinguished by its predecessor by featuring a folding "clamshell" form factor and two screens—the lower screen being a [[touchscreen]] enabling input with an included [[Stylus (computing)|stylus pen]]. It was also Nintendo's first handheld console to have built-in wireless capabilities, supporting both local communication between other DS consoles, and internet communications via the now-discontinued [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] service. 

The line comprised three models; the original [[Nintendo DS]], the [[Nintendo DS Lite]]—a streamlined version of the original model with brighter screens, and the [[Nintendo DSi]]—an enhanced iteration of the DS Lite with updated hardware, support for internal and removable storage, [[digital camera|cameras]], and updated system software with photo and sound recording [[mobile app|apps]], as well as the ability to download and purchase additional software via the [[DSIWare]] [[Digital distribution|store]]. The DSi was also released in a larger XL model.

Throughout its lifetime, [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation Portable]] has been the main market competitor. There have been four different models of the Nintendo DS line on the market: the original [[Nintendo DS]], the [[Nintendo DS Lite]], as well as the [[Nintendo DSi]] and its XL variant. The Nintendo DS line has been highly successful, continuing the trend of its predecessor, the Game Boy line. With over 154 million units sold worldwide, the DS models are the best-selling handheld consoles, and second best-selling console overall behind the [[PlayStation 2]]. 

The DS line was officially superseded by the [[Nintendo 3DS family]] in 2011; the 3DS line carries similarities in functionality to the DSi, but with further enhancements to its internal hardware and software, as well as some models featuring an [[Autostereoscopy|autostereoscopic]] 3D display.

The '''Nintendo DS''' (abbreviated to '''DS''')  is a dual-screen [[handheld game console]] developed and released by [[Nintendo]]. The device went on sale in [[North America]] on November 21, 2004. The DS, short for "Developers' System" or "Dual Screen",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nintendo DS Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/ds/faq.jsp#ds|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced distinctive new features to handheld gaming: an [[LCD]] screen working in tandem with a [[touchscreen]], a built-in [[microphone]], and support for [[wireless network|wireless connectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darkain.com/nintendo_ds/nifi.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217195147/http://www.darkain.com/nintendo_ds/nifi.php|archivedate=2005-02-17 |title=Nintendo DS – WI-FI vs NI-FI |author=Darkain |date=2005-01-21|accessdate=2006-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both screens are encompassed within a [[Flip (form)|clamshell]] design similar to the [[Game Boy Advance SP]]. The Nintendo DS also features the ability for multiple DS consoles to directly interact with each other over [[Wi-Fi]] within a short range without the need to connect to an existing wireless network.  Alternatively, they could interact online using the now-discontinued [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] service.

Prior to its release, the Nintendo DS was marketed as a "third pillar" in Nintendo's console lineup, meant to complement the Game Boy Advance and GameCube. However, backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales ultimately established the new handheld console as the successor to the Game Boy series.{{Clear}}

{{main article|Nintendo DS Lite}}
[[File:Nintendo-DS-Lite-Black-Open.jpg|thumb|170px|A black Nintendo DS Lite in its opened position.]]
{{expand section|date=November 2013}}
The '''Nintendo DS Lite''' (abbreviated to '''DS Lite''') is a dual-screen [[handheld game console]] developed and manufactured by [[Nintendo]]. It is a slimmer, brighter, and more lightweight redesign of the original [[Nintendo DS]]. It was announced on January 26, 2006, more than a month before its initial release in Japan on March 2, 2006 due to overwhelming demand for the original model. &lt;ref name="reggie_interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rojas|first=Peter|date =2006-02-20| url= https://www.engadget.com/2006/02/20/the-engadget-interview-reggie-fils-aime-executive-vice-preside/|title= The Engadget Interview: Reggie Fils-Aime, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Nintendo|publisher= Engadget|accessdate=2006-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been released in Australia, North America, Europe, New Zealand, Singapore, and defined regions in South America, the Middle East, and East Asia. As of December 31, 2013, shipments of the DS Lite have reached 93.86 million units worldwide, according to Nintendo. It was the final handheld to have backwards compatibility with Game Boy Advance games.&lt;ref name="nintendosales"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/library/historical_data/pdf/consolidated_sales_e1409.pdf |title=Consolidated Sales Transition by Region |accessdate=2015-01-16 |date=2014-10-28 |publisher=Nintendo |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

=== Nintendo DSi ===
{{main article|Nintendo DSi}}
[[File:Nintendo-DSi-Bl-Open.jpg|thumb|170px|A black Nintendo DSi in its opened position.]]
The '''Nintendo DSi''' (abbreviated to '''DSi''')&lt;ref name=spec/&gt; is a dual-screen [[handheld game console]] released by [[Nintendo]]. The console launched in Japan on November 1, 2008, and worldwide beginning in April 2009. It is the third [[iteration]] of the [[Nintendo DS]], and its primary market rival is [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP). Development of the DSi began in late 2006, and the handheld was unveiled during an October 2008 Nintendo conference in Tokyo. Consumer demand convinced Nintendo to produce a slimmer handheld with larger screens than the [[Nintendo DS Lite|DS Lite]]. Consequently, Nintendo removed the [[Game Boy Advance]] (GBA) cartridge slot to improve portability without sacrificing durability.

While the DSi's design is similar to that of the DS Lite, it features two [[digital camera]]s, supports internal and external content storage, and connects to an online store called the Nintendo DSi Shop (which was discontinued in 2017) . Nintendo stated that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles. Its new functionality was intended to facilitate personalization, so as to encourage each member of a household to purchase a DSi. The handheld supports exclusive physical media in addition to DS games with DSi-specific features and [[List of Nintendo DS games|standard DS titles]]. The only exception to its [[backward compatibility]] are earlier DS games that required the GBA slot. As of September 30, 2014, Nintendo had sold 41.37 million DSi and DSi XL units combined.&lt;ref name="nintendosales"/&gt;

Reviews of the Nintendo DSi were generally positive; although [[IGN]] and ''[[bit-tech]]'' decried the console's lack of exclusive software and removal of the GBA cartridge slot, its added functionality caused many journalists to recommend it to those who had not purchased a previous DS model. Numerous critics were disappointed with the limited resolution of DSi's cameras, though others such as [[Ars Technica]] and [[GameSpot]] agreed they were adequate for the handheld's display. [[CNET]] and ''[[PCWorld (magazine)|PCWorld]]'' considered the DSi Shop to be the most important buying incentive for current DS owners.{{Clear}}

=== Nintendo DSi XL ===
{{main article|Nintendo DSi XL}}
[[File:Nintendo-DSi-XL-Burg.jpg|thumb|170px|A burgundy Nintendo DSi XL in its opened position.]]
The '''Nintendo DSi XL''' (abbreviated to '''DSi XL''') features larger screens, and a greater overall size, than the original DSi. It is the fourth DS model, the first to be available as a pure size variation.&lt;ref name=Briefing&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/library/events/091030/09.html|title=Corporate Management Policy Briefing / Semi-annual Financial Results Briefing|accessdate=2009-11-09|author=Satoru Iwata |date=2009-10-30|publisher=Nintendo|pages=9–10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106150931/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/library/events/091030/09.html|archivedate=2009-11-06|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iwata said that cost restraints had, until then, limited the screen size and multiplayer aspects of portable game consoles, and that the DSi XL offers "an improved view angle on the screens", which makes it the first "portable system that can be enjoyed with people surrounding the gamer."&lt;ref name=Briefing/&gt; He argued that this introduces a new method of playing portable video games, wherein those "surrounding the game player can also join in one way or the other to the gameplay."&lt;ref name=Briefing/&gt; While the original DSi was specifically designed for individual use, Iwata suggested that DSi XL buyers give the console a "steady place on a table in the living room," so that it might be shared by multiple household members.&lt;ref name=Briefing/&gt;

The DSi XL is the longest, widest and heaviest DS model.&lt;ref name=spec&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiLL/spec.html|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2009-11-09|title=ニンテンドーDSi LL：スペック|language=Japanese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722115913/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiLL/spec.html|archivedate=2011-07-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anoop2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/687/687783p1.html|title=DS Lite Colors Revealed|accessdate=2009-12-03|author=Anoop Gantayat|date=2006-02-10|work=IGN|publisher=Fox Interactive Media|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203170240/http://ds.ign.com/articles/687/687783p1.html|archivedate =2009-02-03|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The console features two {{convert|4.2|in|mm|adj=on}} wide-viewing-angle LCD screens with the same resolution as the smaller model.&lt;ref name="Iwata Asks XL p2"&gt;{{cite interview|subject=Masato Kuwahara|subject2=Masaki Amano|subject3=Kazou Yoneyama|subject4=Takaki Fujino|interviewer=Satoru Iwata|title=Nintendo DSi XL|url=http://www.nintendodsi.com/iwata-asks-chapter.jsp?interviewId=4&amp;volumeId=1&amp;chapterId=2|type=Interview: Transcript|work=Iwata Asks|publisher=Nintendo|date=2009-11-30|accessdate=2010-02-11|location=Kyoto, Japan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126054155/http://nintendodsi.com/iwata-asks-chapter.jsp?interviewId=4&amp;volumeId=1&amp;chapterId=2 |archivedate=2010-11-26|deadurl=yes|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has improved battery life over the DSi on all brightness settings; for example, batteries last 13–17 hours at the dimmest setting.&lt;ref name=spec/&gt; The handheld is outfitted with identical speakers contained in larger [[speaker enclosure]]s, enabling them to produce louder sound.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9151">'''Pacemaker failure''' is the inability of an implanted [[artificial pacemaker]] to perform its intended function of regulating the beating of the [[heart]]. A pacemaker uses electrical impulses delivered by electrodes in order to contract the heart muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McWilliam|first=John A.|date=1889-02-16|title=Electrical Stimulation of the Heart in Man|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/1/1468/348|journal=Br Med J|language=en|volume=1|issue=1468|pages=348–350|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.1468.348|issn=0007-1447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure of a pacemaker is defined by the requirement of repeat surgical pacemaker-related procedures after the initial implantation. Most implanted pacemakers are dual chambered and have two leads, causing the implantation time to take longer because of this more complicated pacemaker system. These factors can contribute to an increased rate of complications which can lead to pacemaker failure.&lt;ref name=":023"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiviniemi|first=Mikko S.|last2=Pirnes|first2=Markku A.|last3=Eränen|first3=H.

Approximately 2.25 million pacemakers were implanted in the United States between 1990 and 2002, and of those pacemakers, about 8,834 were removed from patients because of device malfunction most commonly connected to generator abnormalities.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2005|title=Pacemakers malfunction less often than defibrillators|journal=AORN Journal|volume=82|pages=862|via=Gale Health Reference Center Academic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, results of an Oregon study indicated that 10% of implanted pacemakers failed within the first month.&lt;ref name=":223"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reinhart|first=Steven|date=April 1981|title=Type and timing of permanent pacemaker failure|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/content/81/4/433|format=|journal=Chest|series=|language=|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=|volume=81|issue=4|pages=433–5|bibcode=|doi=10.1378/chest.81.4.433|oclc=|pmc=|pmid=7067508|id=|quote=|authorlink=|author2=McAnulty J|author3=Dobbs J|accessdate=2009-09-08|laysummary=|laysource=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that more than half of pacemaker complications occurred during the first 3 months after implantation.&lt;ref name=":023" /&gt; Causes of pacemaker failure include lead related failure, unit malfunction, problems at the insertion site, failures related to exposure to high voltage electricity or high intensity microwaves, and a miscellaneous category (one patient had [[ventricular tachycardia]] when using his electric razor and another patient had persistent pacing of the diaphragm muscle).&lt;ref name=":223" /&gt; Pacemaker malfunction has the ability to cause serious injury or death, but if detected early enough, patients can continue with their needed therapy once complications are resolved.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Moderate dizziness or lightheadedness

* [[Palpitations]]
* [[Hiccup|Hiccups&amp;nbsp;]]

==Causes==
===Direct factors===
* Lead dislodgement
** A Macro-dislodgement is radiographically visible.&lt;ref name=":322"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuertes|first=Beatriz|last2=Toquero|first2=Jorge|last3=Arroyo-Espliguero|first3=Ramon|last4=Lozano|first4=Ignacio F|date=2003-10-01|title=Pacemaker Lead Displacement: Mechanisms And Management|journal=Indian Pacing and Electrophysiology Journal|volume=3|issue=4|pages=231–238|issn=0972-6292|pmc=1513524|pmid=16943923}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** A Micro-dislodgement is a minimal displacement in the lead that is not visible in a chest X-ray, but has the ability to increase the capture threshold and eventually cause a loss of capture.&lt;ref name=":322" /&gt;
** Lead dislodgement can cause sensing failure, which occurs when proper atrial or ventricular sensing is not achieved by the programming of the pacemaker. Ventricular lead dislodgement is less common compared to atrial lead dislodgement.&lt;ref name=":023" /&gt;
** Causes
*** [[Twiddler's syndrome|Twiddler's Syndrome]]
**** The patient's constant manipulation of the pulse generator within its skin pocket can lead to a dislodgement of the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salahuddin|first=Mohammad|last2=Cader|first2=Fathima Aaysha|last3=Nasrin|first3=Sahela|last4=Chowdhury|first4=Mashhud Zia|date=2016-01-01|title=The pacemaker-twiddler’s syndrome: an infrequent cause of pacemaker failure|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13104-015-1818-0|journal=BMC Research Notes|volume=9|pages=32|doi=10.1186/s13104-015-1818-0|issn=1756-0500|pmc=4721019|pmid=26790626}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generator is rotated on its longitudinal axis, which causes traction and results in a lead dislodgement.&lt;ref name=":322" /&gt;
*** Reel's Syndrome
**** Like Twiddler's Syndrome, it is the manipulation of the pulse generator, but instead the generator is rotated on its transverse axis, which rolls the lead around the generator, creating dislodgement.&lt;ref name=":322" /&gt;
*** Direct trauma over the system.&lt;ref name=":322" /&gt;
* Lead fracture&lt;ref name=":023" /&gt;
* Unit malfunction
** Battery failure, component malfunction, or generator failure&lt;ref name=":223" /&gt;
* Problems at the insertion site
** Infection of the insertion site can cause local inflammation or the formation of an abscess in the pulse generator pocket.&lt;ref name=":023" /&gt;
** Infection can cause the erosion of part of the pacing system that is in the skin.&lt;ref name=":023" /&gt;
* Failures related to exposure to high voltage electricity or high intensity microwaves&lt;ref name=":223" /&gt;

===Indirect factors===
* Power-generating equipment, arc welding equipment and powerful magnets (as in medical devices, heavy equipment or motors) can inhibit pulse generators. Patients who work with or near such equipment should know that their pacemakers may not work properly in those conditions.&lt;ref name="americanheart222"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4676|title=Pacemakers|publisher=American Heart Association|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* With the advances of technology, [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) is making new frequencies available. Cellphones using these new frequencies might make pacemakers less reliable. A group of cellphone companies is studying that possibility.&lt;ref name="americanheart222" /&gt;
* Equipment used by doctors and dentists can affect pacemakers.&lt;ref name="americanheart222" /&gt;
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) uses a powerful magnet to produce images of internal organs and their functions. Metal objects are attracted to the magnet and are normally not allowed near MRI machines. The magnet can interrupt the pacing and inhibit the output of pacemakers. If MRI must be done, the pacemaker output in some models can be reprogrammed.&lt;ref name="americanheart222" /&gt;  In February 2011, the FDA approved an MRI-safe pacemaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theheart.org/article/1182875.do|title=FDA approves first "MRI-safe" pacemaker|last=Miller|first=Reed|date=9 February 2011|publisher=theheart.org|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) procedure is safe for most pacemaker patients, with some reprogramming of the pacing. Careful follow-up after the procedure is required. Patients with certain kinds of pacemakers implanted in the abdomen should avoid ESWL.&lt;ref name="americanheart222" /&gt;
* Diagnostic radiation (such as screening [[X-ray]]) appears to have no effect on pacemaker pulse generators. However, [[therapeutic radiation]] (such as for treating cancerous [[tumors]]) may damage the pacemaker's circuits. The degree of damage is unpredictable and may vary with different systems. However, the risk is significant and builds up as the radiation dose increases. The American Heart Association recommends that the pacemaker be shielded as much as possible, and moved if it lies directly in the radiation field.&lt;ref name="americanheart222" /&gt;
* Short-wave or microwave diathermy uses high-frequency, high-intensity signals. These may bypass pacemaker's noise protection and interfere with or permanently damage the pulse generator.&lt;ref name="americanheart222" /&gt;
==Prevention&lt;ref name=":322" /&gt;==
* Lead displacement
** Adequate surgical implantation.
** Usage of active fixation leads.
** Verification of lead position 24–48 hours implantation.

==Treatment&lt;ref name=":322" /&gt;==
* Lead displacement
** Early displacements: surgical repositioning of the lead or lead repositioning via percutaneous access.
** Late displacements: implanting a new lead in the chamber where displacement has occurred.

'''Plastic explosive''' is a soft and hand-moldable solid form of [[explosive material]]. Within the field of [[explosives engineering]], plastic explosives are also known as '''putty explosives'''.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;

Plastic explosives are especially suited for explosive [[demolition]]. Common plastic explosives include [[Semtex]] and [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]]. The first discovered plastic explosive was [[gelignite]] in 1875, invented by [[Alfred Nobel]].

==Usage==
[[Image:C4 plastic explosive.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A C-4 charge packed onto a marine anchor chain]]

Plastic explosives are especially suited for explosive demolition of obstacles and [[fortification]]s by [[engineer]]s, [[combat engineer]]s and criminals as they can be easily formed into the best shapes for cutting structural members and have a high enough [[velocity of detonation]] and [[density]] for metal cutting work.

An early use of plastic explosives was in the warhead of the [[Mortar (weapon)#Spigot mortar|Petard demolition mortar]] of the British [[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]] (AVRE); said mortar was used to destroy concrete fortifications encountered during [[Operation Overlord]] (D-Day). The original use of Nobel 808 supplied by the SOE {{See below|History}} was for [[sabotage]] of German installations and railways in [[German-occupied Europe|Occupied Europe]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

They are generally not used for ordinary [[Rock blasting|blasting]] as they tend to be significantly more expensive than other materials that perform just as well in this application.{{dubious|Dubious blasting claim|date=November 2013}} A common commercial use of plastic explosives is for [[shock hardening]] high [[manganese]] percentage steel,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070525120609/http://www.pacaero.com/products/explosive-hardening.htm ''Explosive Hardening''], PA&amp;E, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; a material typically used for train rail components and earth digging implements.

Some [[terrorism|terrorist]] groups have used plastic explosives. In October 2000, al-Qa'ida used C-4 to [[USS Cole bombing|attack]] the [[USS Cole (DDG-67)|USS ''Cole'']], killing 17 sailors.&lt;ref name="Guardian Bomb Type"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/aug/21/alqaida.iraq |title=Bomb type and tactics point to al-Qaida |last= Whitaker|first=Brian |date=21 August 2003 &lt;!-- 09.00 BST --&gt; |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=July 11, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, terrorists used C-4 to blow up the [[Khobar Towers bombing|Khobar Towers]] U.S. military housing complex in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fas.org/irp/news/2001/06/khobar.html|title=ATTORNEY GENERAL STATEMENT ON KHOBAR TOWERS INDICTMENT|work=fas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reactive armor]] in tanks uses plastic explosives sandwiched between two plates of steel. Incoming high explosive anti-tank rounds pierce the outer steel plate, then detonate the plastic explosive. This absorbs the energy from the incoming tank round and shields the tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Soldiers Handbook, Volume 1: Explosives Operations|last1=Ledgard|first1=Jared|date=2007|chapter=Introduction to Explosives}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

==History==
[[File:Preparation_of_the_demolition_with_explosive_charges_and_wire_(22731570152).jpg|thumb|Disposal of munitions with plastic explosives]]

The first plastic explosive was [[gelignite]], invented by [[Alfred Nobel]] in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/03/how-to/how-to-handle-gelignite|title=How to handle gelignite|last=Braddock|first=Kevin|date=3 February 2011|publisher=Wired Magazine|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to [[World War I]], the British explosives chemist Oswald Silberrad obtained British and U.S. patents for a series of plastic explosives called "Nitrols", composed of nitrated [[aromaticity|aromatics]], [[collodion]], and oxidising inorganic salts.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent # 1092758&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the patents indicate that at this time, Silberrad saw no need to explain to "those versed in the art" either what he meant by plasticity nor why it may be advantageous, as he only explains why his plastic explosive is superior to others of that type.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

One of the simplest plastic explosives was Nobel's Explosive No. 808, also known as ''Nobel 808'' (often just called ''Explosive 808'' in the [[British Armed Forces]] during the [[Second World War]]), developed by the British company [[Nobel Chemicals Ltd]] well before World War II. It had the appearance of green [[plasticine]] with a distinctive smell of almonds. During World War II it was extensively used by the British [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) for sabotage missions. It is also the explosive used in [[High explosive squash head|HESH]] [[anti-tank]] shells and was an essential factor in the devising of the [[Gammon bomb|Gammon grenade]]. Captured SOE-supplied Nobel 808 was the explosive used in the failed [[20 July plot]] assassination attempt on [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1944.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

During and after World War II a number of new [[RDX]]-based explosives were developed, including [[Composition C|Compositions C, C2, and eventually C3]]. Together with RDX these incorporate various plasticisers to decrease sensitivity and make the composition plastic. The origin of the obsolete term "'''plastique'''" dates back to the Nobel 808 explosive introduced to the U.S. by the British in 1940. The samples of explosive brought to the U.S. by the [[Tizard Mission]] had already been packaged by the SOE ready for dropping via parachute container to the [[French Resistance]] and were therefore labelled in French, as ''Explosif Plastique''. It is still referred to by this name in France and also by some Americans.

==Types==
===Composition C===
[[File:C4 explosive.jpg|thumb|right|A 1.25 lb demolition charge of C4 explosive]]
[[File:USMC-100609-M-0761B-014.jpg|thumb|A marine shapes a charge of C4 to cut through solid steel at a demolitions range]]
The British used a plastic explosive during World War II as a demolition charge. The specific explosive, Composition C, was 88.3% RDX and 11.7% non-oily, non-explosive plasticizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maritime.org/doc/ordnance/index.htm |title=U.S. Explosive Ordnance, OP1664 |date=28 May 1947 |page=5 |publisher=San Francisco National Maritime Park Association |website=maritime.org |author=Department of the Navy, Bureau of Ordnancee |access-date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material was plastic between 0 and 40 degrees C, but was brittle at colder temperatures and gummy at higher temperatures. Composition C was superseded by Composition C2, which used a mixture of 80% RDX and 20% plasticizer. Composition C2 had a wider temperature range at which it remained plastic, from −30 to 52 degrees C. Composition C2 was replaced by Composition C3, which was a mixture of 77% RDX and 23% explosive plasticizer.&lt;ref name="milex"&gt;{{cite book|title=Military Explosives|year=1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODYYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=SA8-PA109&amp;lpg=SA8-PA109&amp;dq=plasticize+explosive&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZIu1LS2qEn&amp;sig=ra7BwoYmHVUYGVdL0ekz4IxH9Mw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi62fXDlcHSAhUB02MKHZb8AC44ChDoAQg5MAs#v=onepage&amp;q=plastic&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–109}} C3 was effective but proved to be too brittle in cold weather and was replaced with C4. There are three classes of C4, with varying amounts of RDX and [[polyisobutylene]].&lt;ref name="milex" /&gt;{{rp|8–111}}

A '''radio repeater''' is a combination of a radio receiver and a radio transmitter that receives a signal and retransmits it, so that [[two-way radio]] signals can cover longer distances. A repeater sited at a high elevation can allow two mobile stations, otherwise out of [[line-of-sight propagation]] range of each other, to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Way Radio Repeater|url=http://www.radiotronics.co.uk/solutions/repeater/|website=Radiotronics|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeaters are found in professional, commercial, and government mobile radio systems and also in [[Amateur radio repeater|amateur radio]].

Repeater systems use two different radio frequencies; the mobiles transmit on one frequency, and the repeater station receives those transmission and transmits on a second frequency.  Since the repeater must transmit at the same time as the signal is being received, and may even use the same antenna for both transmitting and receiving, frequency-selective filters are required to prevent the receiver from being overloaded by the transmitted signal. Some repeaters use two different frequency bands to provide isolation between input and output or as a convenience.

In a [[communications satellite]], a [[transponder]] serves a similar function, but the transponder does not necessarily demodulate the relayed signals.

==Full duplex operation==

[[File:Motorola-DR3000.jpg|thumb|200px|Motorola MOTOTRBO Repeater DR3000 with [[duplexer]] mounted in Flightcase, 100% Duty cycle up to 40 W output]]
A repeater is an automatic radio-relay station, usually located on a mountain top, tall building, or radio tower.  It allows communication between two or more bases, mobile or portable stations that are unable to communicate directly with each other due to distance or obstructions between them.

The repeater receives on one radio [[frequency]] (the "input" frequency), demodulates the signal, and simultaneously re-transmits the information on its "output" frequency.  All stations using the repeater transmit on the repeater's input frequency and receive on its output frequency.  Since the repeater is usually located at an elevation higher than the other radios using it, their range is greatly extended.

[[Image:Repeater input.jpg|right|200px]]

Because the transmitter and receiver are on at the same time, isolation must exist to keep the repeater's own transmitter from degrading the repeater receiver. If the repeater transmitter and receiver are not isolated well, the repeater's own transmitter ''desensitizes'' the repeater receiver. The problem is similar to being at a rock concert and not being able to hear the weak signal of a conversation over the much stronger signal of the band.

In general, isolating the receiver from the transmitter is made easier by maximizing, as much as possible, the separation between input and output frequencies.

When operating through a repeater, mobile stations must transmit on a different frequency than the repeater output. Although the repeater site must be capable of simultaneous reception and transmission (on two different frequencies), mobile stations can operate in one mode at a time, alternating between receiving and transmitting; so, mobile stations do not need the bulky, and costly filters required at a repeater site.   Mobile stations may have an option to select a "talk around" mode to transmit and receive on the same frequency; this is sometimes used for local communication within range of the mobile units.

==Frequency separation: input to output==
There is no set rule about spacing of input and output frequencies for all radio repeaters. Any spacing where the designer can get sufficient isolation between receiver and transmitter will work.

In some countries, under some radio services, there are agreed-on conventions or separations that are required by the system license. In the case of input and output frequencies in the United States, for example:
* Amateur repeaters in the [[2-meter band|144–148 MHz band]] usually use a 600&amp;nbsp;kHz (0.6&amp;nbsp;MHz) separation, in the  [[70-centimeter band|420–450 MHz band]] use a 5&amp;nbsp;MHz separation, and in the [[33-centimeter band|902–928 MHz band]] use a 25&amp;nbsp;MHz separation.
* Systems in the 450–470&amp;nbsp;MHz band use a 5&amp;nbsp;MHz separation with the input on the higher frequency. Example: input is 456.900&amp;nbsp;MHz; output is 451.900&amp;nbsp;MHz.
* Systems in the 806–869&amp;nbsp;MHz band use a 45&amp;nbsp;MHz separation with the input on the lower frequency. Example: input is 810.1875&amp;nbsp;MHz; output is 855.1875&amp;nbsp;MHz.
* Military systems are suggested to use no less than a 10&amp;nbsp;MHz spacing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/policy/army/fm/24-18/fm24-18_9.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

These are just a few examples. There are many other separations or spacings between input and output frequencies in operational systems.

===Same band frequencies===

Same band repeaters operate with input and output frequencies in the same frequency band. For example, in US two-way radio, 30–50&amp;nbsp;MHz is one band and 150–174&amp;nbsp;MHz is another. A repeater with an input of 33.980&amp;nbsp;MHz and an output of 46.140&amp;nbsp;MHz is a same band repeater.

In same band repeaters, a central design problem is keeping the repeater's own transmitter from interfering with the receiver. Reducing the coupling between transmitter and input frequency receiver is called ''isolation''.

====Duplexer system====

[[Image:Repeater duplexer.png|right|200px]]In same-band repeaters, isolation between transmitter and receiver can be created by using a single antenna and a device called a ''[[duplexer]]''. The device is a tuned filter connected to the antenna. In this example, consider a type of device called a ''band-pass duplexer''. It allows, or passes, a band, (or a narrow range,) of frequencies.

There are two legs to the duplexer filter, one is tuned to pass the input frequency, the other is tuned to pass the output frequency. Both legs of the filter are coupled to the antenna. The repeater receiver is connected to the receive leg while the transmitter is connected to the transmit leg. The duplexer prevents degradation of the receiver sensitivity by the transmitter in two ways.  First, the receive leg greatly attenuates the transmitter's carrier at the receiver input (typically by 90-100 dB), preventing the carrier from overloading (blocking) the receiver front end.  Second, the transmit leg attenuates the transmitter broadband noise on the receiver frequency, also typically by 90-100 dB.  By virtue of the transmitter and receiver being on different frequencies, they can operate at the same time on a single antenna.

====Combining system====

There is often not enough tower space to accommodate a separate antenna for each repeater at crowded equipment sites. In same-band repeaters at engineered, shared equipment sites, repeaters can be connected to shared antenna systems. These are common in [[Trunked radio system|trunked systems]], where up to 29 repeaters for a single trunked system may be located at the same site. (Some architectures such as iDEN sites may have more than 29 repeaters.)

In a shared system, a receive antenna is usually located at the top of the antenna tower. Putting the receive antenna at the top helps to capture weaker received signals than if the receive antenna were lower of the two. By splitting the received signal from the antenna, many receivers can work satisfactorily from a single antenna. Devices called ''receiver multicouplers'' split the signal from the antenna into many receiver connections. The multicoupler amplifies the signals reaching the antenna, then feeds them to several receivers, attempting to make up for losses in the power dividers (or splitters). These operate similarly to a cable TV splitter but must be built to higher quality standards so they work in environments where strong interfering signals are present.

On the transmitter side, a second transmit antenna is installed somewhere below the receive antenna. There is an electrical relationship defined by the distance between transmit and receive antennas. A desirable null exists if the transmit antenna is located exactly below the receive antenna beyond a minimum distance. Almost the same isolation as a low-grade duplexer (about −60 decibels) can be accomplished by installing the transmit antenna below, and along the centerline of, the receive antenna. Several transmitters can be connected to the same antenna using filters called ''combiners''. Transmitters usually have directional devices installed along with the filters that block any reflected power in the event the antenna malfunctions. The antenna must have a power rating that will handle the sum of energy of all connected transmitters at the same time.

Transmitter combining systems are lossy. As a rule of thumb, each leg of the combiner has a 50% (3 decibel) power loss. If two transmitters are connected to a single antenna through a combiner, half of their power will reach the combiner output. (This assumes everything is working properly.) If four transmitters are coupled to one antenna, a quarter of each transmitter's power will reach the output of the combining circuit. Part of this loss can be made up with increased antenna gain. Fifty watts of transmitter power to the antenna will make a received signal strength at a distant mobile radio that is almost identical to 100 watts.

In trunked systems with many channels, a site design may include several transmit antennas to reduce combining network losses. For example, a six-channel trunked system may have two transmit antennas with three transmitters connected to each of the two transmit antennas. Because small variations affect every antenna, each antenna will have a slightly different directional pattern. Each antenna will interact with the tower and other nearby antennas differently. If one were to measure received signal levels, this would cause a variation among channels on a single trunked system. Variations in signal strength among channels on one trunked system can also be caused by:
* failed parts in the combiner, 
* characteristics of the design, 
* loose connectors, 
* bad cables, 
* mistuned filters, or; 
* incorrectly installed components.

====Modern====

[[Crossband operation|Cross-band]] repeaters are sometimes a part of government trunked radio systems. If one community is on a trunked system and the neighboring community is on a conventional system, a talk group or agency-fleet-subfleet may be designated to communicate with the other community. In an example where the community is on 153.755&amp;nbsp;MHz, transmitting on the trunked system talk group would repeat on 153.755&amp;nbsp;MHz. Signals received by a base station on 153.755&amp;nbsp;MHz would go over the trunked system on an assigned talk group.

In conventional government systems, cross band repeaters are sometimes used to connect two agencies who use radio systems on different bands. For example, a fire department in Colorado was on a 46&amp;nbsp;MHz channel while a police department was on a 154&amp;nbsp;MHz channel, they built a cross-band repeater to allow communication between the two agencies.

If one of the systems is simplex, the repeater must have logic preventing transmitter keying in both directions at the same time. [[Diversity combining|Voting]] comparators with a transmitter keying matrix are sometimes used to connect incompatible base stations.

====Historic====

In looking at records of old systems, examples of cross-band commercial systems were found in every US radio service where regulations allowed them. In California, specific systems using cross-band repeaters have existed at least since the 1960s. Historic examples of cross-band systems include:&lt;ref&gt;From historic records of Federal Communications Commission licenses.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Solano County, California|Solano County]] Fire, (former Fire Radio Service): 46.240 input; 154.340 output. This system was dismantled in the 1980s and is now a same band repeater.
* Mid-Valley Fire District, [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], (former Fire Radio Service): 46.140 input; 154.445 output. This system was dismantled in the 1980s and is now a same band repeater.
* [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] Department of Parks and Recreation, (former Forestry Conservation Radio Service): 44.840&amp;nbsp;MHz input; 151.445&amp;nbsp;MHz output. This system was dismantled in the 1980s and is now a same band repeater.
* [[California|State of California]], Governor's Office of Emergency Services, Fire, (former Fire Radio Service): 33.980&amp;nbsp;MHz input; 154.160&amp;nbsp;MHz output.

In commercial systems, manufacturers stopped making cross band mobile radio equipment with acceptable specifications for public safety systems in the early 1980s. At the time, some systems were dismantled because new radio equipment was not available. Sporadic E ionospheric ducting can make the 46MHz and below frequencies unworkable in summer.

====As links====

For decades, cross-band repeaters have been used as fixed links. The links can be used for remote control of base stations at distant sites or to send audio from a diversity (voting) receiver site back to the diversity combining system (voting comparator). Some legacy links occur in the US 150–170&amp;nbsp;MHz band. US Federal Communications Commission rule changes did not allow 150&amp;nbsp;MHz links after the 1970s. Newer links are more often seen on 72–76&amp;nbsp;MHz (Mid-band), 450–470&amp;nbsp;MHz interstitial channels, or 900&amp;nbsp;MHz links. These links, known as ''fixed'' stations in US licensing, typically connect an equipment site with a dispatching office.

====Vehicular repeaters====

Modern amateur radios sometimes include cross-band repeat capability native to the radio transceiver.

In commercial systems, cross-band repeaters are sometimes used in vehicular repeaters. For example, a 150&amp;nbsp;MHz hand held may communicate to a vehicle-mounted low-power transceiver. The low-power radio repeats transmissions from the portable over the vehicle's high power mobile radio, which has a much longer range. In these systems, the hand-held works so long as it is within range of the low power mobile repeater. The mobile radio is usually on a different band than the hand-held to reduce the chances of the mobile radio transmitter interfering with the transmission from the hand-held to the vehicle.

* Motorola, for example, marketed a vehicular repeater system called PAC*RT. It was available for use with 150&amp;nbsp;MHz or 450&amp;nbsp;MHz hand-helds and interfaced with some Motorola mobile radios.
* In the 1980s, General Electric Mobile Radio had a 463&amp;nbsp;MHz emergency medical services radio that featured a 453&amp;nbsp;MHz vehicular repeater link to a hand-held.

There is a difficult engineering problem with these systems. If you get two vehicle radios at the same location, some protocol has to be established so that one portable transmitting doesn't activate two or more mobile radio transmitters. Motorola uses a hierarchy system with PAC*RT, each repeater transmits a tone when it is turned on, so the last one on site that turns on is the one that gets used. This is so several of them are not on at once.

Vehicular repeaters are complex but can be less expensive than designing a system that covers a large area and works with the weak signal levels of hand-held radios. Some models of radio signals suggest that the transmitters of hand-held radios create received signals at the base station one to two orders of magnitude (10 to 20 decibels or 10 to 100 times) weaker than a mobile radio with a similar transmitter output power.

==Siting as part of system design==

Radio repeaters are typically placed in locations which maximize their effectiveness for their intended purpose:
* "Low-level" repeaters are used for local communications, and are placed at low altitude to reduce interference with other users of the same radio frequencies. Low-level systems are used for areas as large as an entire city, or as small as a single [[building]].
* "High-level" repeaters are placed on tall [[tower]]s or [[mountain]]tops to maximize their area of coverage. With these systems, users with low-powered radios (such as hand-held "[[walkie talkie|walkie-talkies]]") can communicate with each other over many miles.

'''Robot Research Initiative (RRI)''' is a research institute dedicated to advanced robotics research. It is an affiliated organization of [[Chonnam National University]] in [[Gwangju]], [[Republic of Korea]]. Prof. [[Jong Oh Park]] moved from the [[Korea Institute of Science and Technology]] to [[Chonnam National University]] in early 2005 and established RRI in March 2008, where he is still actively in charge. RRI is currently a leading institute in the medical [[robotics]] field, especially in the area of biomedical micro/nano robotics. RRI is one of the largest institutions among university robotics laboratories in Korea and competes globally.&lt;ref&gt;“전남대 로봇연구소(Robot Reseaech Initiative)
국내 최대규모 로봇관련 대학부설 연구소“, 로봇신문 25.04.2014 [http://www.irobotnews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2465]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current research focuses of RRI are biomedical micro/nano robotics, surgery robotics, cable robotics, and so on. The Korean government invests roughly 200 million USD annually in the Korean robotics industry, and almost 90% of this budget is designated for R&amp;D. RRI has been actively involved in the government-funded R&amp;D projects. After an over 10-year investment in personal service robotics, as well as IT–based ubiquitous robotics, the government has been strategically investing in medical robotics for the past 6 years. The biomedical micro/nano robotics field in Korea has been exclusively initiated by RRI, and the reputation and status of RRI is currently stable.

The global networking of RRI is mostly focused on biomedical micro/nano robotics, covering engineering and scientific approaches.
Prof. Park and his staff have led both government- and industry-funded R&amp;D robotics projects. As the industry partners [[Samsung Electronics]], [[Hyundai Motors]], [[Daewoo Motors]], and [[DSME]].

The {{lang|de|'''Rote Liste'''|italic=no}}, full name {{lang|de|'''Rote Liste der bedrohten Nutztierrassen im Bundesgebiet'''|italic=no}},&lt;ref name=translation group=lower-alpha/&gt; is a red list of [[rare breed (agriculture)|threatened breeds]] of [[domestic animal]] published annually by the [[Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gefährdeter Haustierrassen]], the German national association for the conservation of historic and endangered domestic animal breeds.&lt;ref name=geh/&gt;

==History==

The GEH was founded in [[Witzenhausen]], in [[Hesse]], central Germany, in 1981. In 1987 it established the criteria on which the Rote Liste is based. The list is published annually, and attributes one of four categories of conservation risk to domestic breeds of cattle, dogs, goats, horses, pigs, rabbits and sheep, of chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys, and of bees; listing of domestic pigeon breeds is in preparation.&lt;ref name=rote/&gt; Some breeds from outside Germany are listed separately. The four levels of risk are:

* I: ''{{lang|de|extrem gefährdet}}'', extremely endangered
* II: ''{{lang|de|stark gefährdet}}'', seriously endangered
* III: ''{{lang|de|gefährdet}}'', endangered
* ''{{lang|de|Vorwarnstufe}}'', alert

The risk level is calculated using a formula that takes into account five criteria: the number of breeding animals or breeding females; the percentage of pure-bred matings; the five-year trend in breed numbers; the number of breeders or herds; and the interval between generations of the animal.&lt;ref name=geh3/&gt;

The GEH also publishes, in conjunction with the {{illm|Bund Deutscher Rassegeflügelzüchter|de}}, the German national association of poultry breeders, a separate list of the historic poultry breeds  and colour varieties that were raised in Germany before 1930. The same levels of conservation risk are assigned as in the main red list.&lt;ref name=rote2/&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Shell Freeze Wall Oil Shale.png|thumb|200px|right|Shells Freeze Wall for ''in situ'' shale oil production]]

The process heats sections of the vast oil shale field ''in situ'', releasing the shale oil and [[oil shale gas]] from the rock so that it can be pumped to the surface and made into [[fuel]]. In this process, a freeze wall is first to be constructed to isolate the processing area from surrounding groundwater.&lt;ref name=rand/&gt; To maximize the functionality of the freeze walls, adjacent working zones will be developed in succession. {{convert|2000|ft|m|0}} wells, eight feet apart, are drilled and filled with a circulating super-chilled liquid to cool the ground to {{convert|-60|°F|°C|-1}}.&lt;ref name=DOE/&gt;&lt;ref name=shell/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Water is then removed from the working zone. Heating and recovery wells are drilled at {{convert|40|ft|m}} intervals within the working zone. Electrical [[heating element]]s are lowered into the heating wells and used to heat oil shale to between {{convert|650|°F|°C|-1}} and {{convert|700|°F|°C|-1}} over a period of approximately four years.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;

==Energy consumption==
A RAND study in 2005 estimated that production of {{convert|100,000|oilbbl/d}} of oil (5.4&amp;nbsp;million tons/year) would theoretically require a dedicated power generating capacity of 1.2&amp;nbsp;gigawatts (10&amp;nbsp;billion kWh/year), assuming deposit richness of {{convert|25|USgal}} per ton, with 100% pyrolysis efficiency, and 100% extraction of pyrolysis products.&lt;ref name=rand/&gt;  If this amount of electricity were to be generated by a coal-fired power plant, it would consume five million ton of coal annually (about 2.2&amp;nbsp;million [[tons oil equivalent|toe]]).&lt;ref name=invest&gt;

In 2006, Shell estimated that over the project life cycle, for every unit of energy consumed, three to four units would be produced.&lt;ref name=DOE/&gt;&lt;ref name=shell/&gt;  Such an "[[energy returned on energy invested]]" would be significantly better than that achieved in the Mahogony trials. For the 1996 trial, Shell applied 440,000&amp;nbsp;kWh (which would require about 96&amp;nbsp;toe energy input in a coal-fired plant), to generate {{convert|250|oilbbl}} of oil (37&amp;nbsp;toe output).&lt;ref&gt;

==Environmental impacts==
Shell's underground conversion process requires significant development on the surface. The separation between drilled wells is less than five meters and wells must be connected by electrical wiring and by piping to storage and processing facilities. Shell estimates that the footprint of extraction operations would be similar to that for conventional oil and gas drilling.&lt;ref name=DOE/&gt;&lt;ref name=shell&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the dimensions of Shell's 2005 trial indicate that a much larger footprint is required. Production of 50,000 bbl/day would require that land be developed at a rate on the order of {{convert|1|km2}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;The trial produced a total of 1800 barrels over the course of a year from wells spaced over an area of {{convert|100|m2}}. For 50,000 bbl/day, the calculated land area per year is 365*50,000*100/1800 = 1 million m2, or 1 km2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive water use and the risk of [[groundwater pollution]] are the technology's greatest challenges.&lt;ref name=fortune&gt;

==Current implementations==
In 2006, Shell received a [[Bureau of Land Management]] lease to pursue a large demonstration with a capacity of {{convert|1,500|oilbbl/d}}; Shell has since dropped those plans and is planning a test based on ICP that would produce a total of minimum {{convert|1,500|oilbbl}}, together with [[nahcolite]], over a seven-year period.&lt;ref&gt;

In Israel, IEI, a subsidiary of [[IDT Corp.]] is planning a shale pilot based on ICP technology. The project would produce a total of 1,500 barrels. However, IEI has also announced that any subsequent projects would not use ICP technology, but would instead utilize horizontal wells and hot gas heating methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | title=IEI Report, Shfela Oil Shale Pilot | date=October 2010 | url=http://www.iei-energy.co.il/IEI/files/c8/c88e0767-9251-4fdf-8e49-966b0c958d45.pdf| page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7568">'''SiGe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|ɡ|iː}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|dʒ|iː}}), or '''silicon-germanium''', is an [[alloy]] with any [[mole(unit)|molar]] ratio of [[silicon]] and [[germanium]], i.e. with a molecular formula of the form Si&lt;sub&gt;1−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is commonly used as a [[semiconductor material]] in [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) for [[heterojunction]] [[bipolar transistor]]s or as a [[strain (materials science)|strain]]-inducing layer for [[CMOS]] transistors.  [[IBM]] introduced the technology into mainstream manufacturing in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Ouellette, Jennifer (June/July 2002). [http://www.aip.org/tip/INPHFA/vol-8/iss-3/p22.pdf "Silicon–Germanium Gives Semiconductors the Edge"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517072053/http://www.aip.org/tip/INPHFA/vol-8/iss-3/p22.pdf |date=2008-05-17 }}, ''The Industrial Physicist''.&lt;/ref&gt; This relatively new technology offers opportunities in [[Mixed-signal integrated circuit|mixed-signal circuit]] and [[analog circuit]] IC design and manufacture. SiGe is also used as a [[thermoelectric]] material for high temperature applications (&gt;700 K).

==Production==
The use of silicon-germanium as a semiconductor was championed by Bernie Meyerson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=B.S. Meyerson|date=March 1994|title=Hi Speed Silicon Germanium Electronics|journal=Scientific American, March 1994, vol. 270.iii pp. 42-47}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
SiGe is manufactured on silicon wafers using conventional silicon [[semiconductor fabrication|processing]] toolsets.  SiGe processes achieve costs similar to those of silicon CMOS manufacturing and are lower than those of other heterojunction technologies such as [[gallium arsenide]].  Recently, organogermanium precursors (e.g. [[isobutylgermane]], alkylgermanium trichlorides, and dimethylaminogermanium trichloride) have been examined as less hazardous liquid alternatives to germane for [[MOVPE]] deposition of Ge-containing films such as high purity Ge, SiGe, and [[strained silicon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=E.

SiGe [[foundry (electronics)|foundry]] services are offered by several semiconductor technology companies. AMD disclosed a joint development with IBM for a SiGe stressed-silicon technology,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~103048,00.html AMD And IBM Unveil New, Higher Performance, More Power Efficient 65nm Process Technologies At Gathering Of Industry’s Top R&amp;D Firms] retrieved at March 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; targeting the 65-nm process. [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation|TSMC]] also sells SiGe manufacturing capacity.

In July 2015, IBM announced that it had created working samples of transistors using a [[7 nanometer|7&amp;nbsp;nm]] silicon-germanium process, promising a quadrupling in the amount of transistors compared to a contemporary process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/technology/ibm-announces-computer-chips-more-powerful-than-any-in-existence.html?_r=0 IBM Discloses Working Version of a Much Higher-Capacity Chip - NYTimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==SiGe transistors==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}{{Too technical|section|date=December 2017}}

SiGe allows CMOS logic to be integrated with [[heterojunction bipolar transistor]]s, making it suitable for mixed-signal circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cressler|first1=J. D.|last2=Niu|first2=G.|title=Silicon-Germanium Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors|date=2003|publisher=Artech House|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heterojunction bipolar transistors have higher forward gain and lower reverse gain than traditional [[bipolar junction transistor|homojunction bipolar transistor]]s.  This translates into better low current and high frequency performance.  Being a heterojunction technology with an adjustable [[band gap]], the SiGe offers the opportunity for more flexible [[bandgap voltage reference|band gap tuning]] than silicon-only technology.

Silicon Germanium-on-insulator (SGOI) is a technology analogous to the [[Silicon on insulator|Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI)]] technology currently employed in computer chips. SGOI increases the speed of the [[transistor]]s inside microchips by [[strain engineering|straining the crystal lattice]] under the [[MOSFET|MOS transistor]] gate, resulting in improved [[electron mobility]] and higher drive currents. SiGe MOSFETs can also provide lower [[pn junction|junction]] leakage due to the lower band gap value of SiGe.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}  However, a major issue with SGOI MOSFETs is the inability to form stable oxides with silicon germanium using standard silicon oxidation processing.

==Thermoelectric application==
A silicon germanium thermoelectric device, MHW-RTG3, was used in the [[Voyager 1]] and 2 spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alphabetenergy.com/thermoelectrics-timeline/]&lt;/ref&gt;
Silicon germanium thermoelectric devices were also used in other MHW-RTGs and GPHS-RTGs aboard Cassini, Galileo, Ulysses, and Flight Units F-1 and F-4.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/nuke/space/gphs.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Resizing''' (including '''miniaturization''', '''growth''', '''shrinking''', and '''enlargement''') is a recurring theme in fiction, in particular in [[fairy tale]]s, [[fantasy]], and [[science fiction]].

==In literature==
*An early example of resizing is the 16th century Chinese novel, ''[[Journey to the West]]''.
*''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' has repeated resizing themes, where Alice grows or shrinks as she eats foodstuffs or drinks potions. According to Rose Lovell-Smith, Alice's size-changes continually reposition her in the food chain, serving as a way to make her acutely aware of the "eat or be eaten" attitude that permeates Wonderland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1353/crt.2004.0020| title = The Animals of Wonderland: Tenniel as Carroll's Reader| journal = Criticism| volume = 45| issue = 4| pages = 383| year = 2004| last1 = Lovell-Smith | first1 = R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The novel ''[[The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]] describes a kind of food that can accelerate and extend the growth process, which when introduced to the world causes great upheavals. In Wells' novel, giants have great powers, and they seek to continue growing and improving; only the small people with their small minds stand in their way. This is a symbol of social groups with great potential suppressed by mainstream society, and an expectation for them to eventually change the world in a radical way. Though one of Wells' lesser-known works, many of the features of the novel have been incorporated into other works.
*In the novel ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', Violet Beauregarde grows into a giant blueberry using magical gum and Mike Teevee uses Wonka's shrink ray to miniaturize himself.
*''Wiplala'', the man with magical spell to shrink all the family to four inches in height.

==Film==
*In 1940's ''[[Dr. Cyclops]]'', the protagonists are reduced to less than a foot in size by the titular [[mad scientist]], and are subjugated to his whims. 1957's ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'' inspired a boom in science fiction films that made use of size-alteration in the late 1950s and the 1960s, and also inspired a comic remake in 1981's ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Woman]]''. 1957 also saw the release of ''[[The Amazing Colossal Man]]''.
*In science fiction/horror [[B-movie]]s, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, enlargement of people or creatures to monstrous size (often accomplished via [[radiation]]) was a common theme. Films featuring enlargement include ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]'', ''[[Village of the Giants]]'', ''[[The Food of the Gods (film)|The Food of the Gods]]'', 1954's ''[[Them!]]'', and ''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]''. [[Bert I. Gordon]] is the filmmaker most closely associated with this genre. 
*Each of the five monsters in DreamWorks 2009 science fiction film ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'' can be traced to sci-fi/horror B movies from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=NYTInspired&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=The Monsters That Inspired ‘Monsters vs. Aliens’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/movies/22sbar.html|accessdate=October 26, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heroine, Susan, who grows to be 49 feet 11 inches tall, was inspired by ''Attack of the 50 Foot Woman''.
*Shrinking is often accomplished with a machine of some kind, as in the films ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'', ''[[Innerspace]]'' and ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]''. In some works, the machine can enlarge as well; in ''[[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid]]'', a shrinking machine makes a toddler 100 feet tall. Both types of machine normally have the ability to reverse the shrinking process (though sometimes, as in ''Fantastic Voyage'', the reversal happens automatically after a certain period).
*In the 1999 science fiction film ''[[My Favorite Martian (film)|My Favorite Martian]]'', Tim shrinks to tiny size.

The caring boyfriend must do all he can to keep her condition a secret from inquisitive classmates and a relative who is a teacher at their school.
*The protagonist of the magical girl manga and [[anime]] series ''[[Hime-chan's Ribbon]]'' is able to transform and resize herself by using a magic ribbon.
*''[[Super Monkey Ball 2]]'', Dr. Bad Boon used the shrinking gun to shrink MeeMee, AiAi, Baby and GonGon turning into tiny size.
*In ''[[Touhou Project]]'', a Japanese video game series, the character Suika Ibuki has the power to grow to giant size by manipulating her density; Suika can turn into a giantess about 50-feet tall and create smaller versions of herself.
*In the music video of [[Relient K]]'s "[[Marilyn Manson Ate My Girlfriend]]", a giant [[Marilyn Manson]] eats a band member's girlfriend and the band has to go into Manson's body to save her.
*The music video to the [[Bis (Scottish band)|Bis]] song "Sweet Shop Avengerz" features Bis, having been miniaturized to only a few inches tall, performing next to a mouse hole.  During the video, the band are nearly crushed by a man with a pen and later, are nearly eaten by a cat.
*Similarly, the video to the [[Kerbdog]] song "[[Mexican Wave]]" portrays the band members as only one inch tall, performing the song on a woman's necklace.
*On the opposite side of the resizing spectrum is the band [[Silver Sun]].  Several of their album and EP covers, including the cover to their self-titled debut album, include giant insects thousands of times larger than their typical size.
*In the anime series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'', miniaturizing cloning technology known as micloning (''maikuro-n ka'' in Japanese) plays a significant role in the coexistence of a giant alien race called [[Zentradi]] and humanity.
*In [[Marvel Comics]], "Pym particles" (invented by character [[Henry Pym]], variously known by the superhero identities Ant-Man, Giant-Man, Goliath and Yellowjacket) cause physical matter to shrink or enlarge by shunting mass into, or drawing mass from, another dimension. In addition to Pym, a number of other superheroes have used Pym particles to change their size, including the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] (Pym's ex-wife), the second [[Hawkeye (comics)|Goliath]], [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]], the second [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]], and the second [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Yellowjacket]]. Pym also designed a prison for [[supervillain]]s that was dubbed "the Big House", in which superhuman criminals who could not be normally incarcerated were shrunk to six inches in height.
*In [[DC Comics]], the equivalent characters are the various individuals who go by the name [[Atom (comics)|The Atom]]. In particular of these people, Professor [[Ray Palmer (comics)|Ray Palmer]] is the foremost authority in size and molecular-density-changing technology. The DC Comics super-heroine [[Elasti-Girl]] also has the power to shrink and grow at will.
*In the videogame ''[[Harley's Humongous Adventure]]'', the title character is miniaturized, justifying fighting against giant rats and other such odds and relying on thumtacks as weaponry.
*Tons of videos on YouTube discuss the improbability of resizing, including [[Vsauce3]]'s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkvo-DrU2gM What Would Happen if You Were Shrunk?] and [[It's Okay to be Smart|PBS]]'s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5YR6wpg7g The Small Problem With Shrinking Ourselves].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1139">In [[computer science]], a vectored [[interrupt]] is a processing technique in which the interrupting device directs the processor to the appropriate [[interrupt service routine]]. This is in contrast to a [[Polling (computer science)|polled interrupt]] system, in which a single interrupt service routine must determine the source of the interrupt by checking all potential interrupt sources, a slow and relatively laborious process.

==Implementation==
Vectored interrupts are achieved by assigning each interrupting device a unique code, typically four to eight bits in length.&lt;ref name="hamacher"&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28080">[[Vegetable oil]]s are increasingly used as a substitute for [[fossil fuels]]. Vegetable oils are the basis of [[biodiesel]], which can be used like conventional [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. Some [[vegetable oil blends]] are used in unmodified vehicles, but [[straight vegetable oil]] needs specially prepared vehicles which have a method of heating the oil to reduce its [[viscosity]] and [[surface tension]]. Another alternative is [[vegetable oil refining]].

The availability of [[biodiesel around the world]] is increasing, although still tiny compared to conventional [[fossil fuel]] sources.  There is significant research in [[algaculture]] methods to make [[biofuel from algae]].

Concerns have been expressed about growing crops for fuel use rather than food and the environmental impacts of large-scale agriculture and land clearing required to expand the production of vegetable oil for fuel use. These effects/impacts would need to be specifically researched and evaluated, economically and ecologically, and weighed in balance with the proposed benefits of vegetable oil fuel in relation to the use of other fuel sources.

== Future of energy for world economy ==
There is a limited amount of [[fossil fuel]] inside the [[Earth]].  Since the current [[world energy resources and consumption]] is mainly fossil fuels, we are very dependent on them for both [[transportation]] and [[electric power generation]].  The [[Hubbert peak theory]] predicts that [[oil depletion]] will result in oil production dropping off in the not too distant future.  As time goes on our economy will have to transition to some [[alternative fuels]]. Fossil fuels have solved two problems which could be separately solved in the future: the problem of a source of [[primary energy]] and of [[energy storage]].  Along with [[straight vegetable oil]] and [[biodiesel]], some energy technologies that could play an important part in the future include:

== Net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or greenhouse gas production ==

Plants use [[sunlight]] and [[photosynthesis]] to take [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) out of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] to make  [[vegetable oil]].  The same CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is then put back after it is burned in an engine.  Thus vegetable oil does not increase the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere, and does not directly contribute to the problem of [[greenhouse gas]].  It is really a way of catching and storing [[solar energy]]; it is a [[renewable energy]].

However, as with other "renewable" energy sources, there may be a (relatively small) carbon footprint associated with production or distribution of vegetable oil.

== Safety ==
[[File:Fryingplantains10-28-06.jpg|right|thumb|[[Plantain (cooking)|Plantains]] frying in vegetable oil]]

[[Vegetable oil]] is far less toxic than other fuels such as [[gasoline]], petroleum-based [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[ethanol]], or [[methanol]], and has a much higher [[flash point]] (approximately 275-290&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canola-council.org/Chemical1-6/Chemical1-6_1.html|title=Chemical1-6_1 |accessdate=October 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022111356/http://www.canola-council.org/Chemical1-6/Chemical1-6_1.html |archivedate=October 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The higher flash point reduces the risk of accidental [[Combustion|ignition]].  Some types of vegetable oil are [[Eating|edible]].

== Generation and storage ==
Technologies of  [[hydrogen economy]], [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[compressed air energy storage]], and [[flywheel energy storage]] address the [[energy storage]] problem but not the source of [[primary energy]].  Other technologies like [[fission power]], [[fusion power]], and [[solar power]] address the problem of a source of [[primary energy]] but not [[energy storage]].  Vegetable oil addresses both the source of [[primary energy]] and of [[energy storage]]. The cost and weight to store a given amount of energy as vegetable oil is low compared to many of the potential replacements for [[fossil fuels]].

== Type of vegetable oil ==
The [[List of vegetable oils#Oils used for biofuel|list of vegetable oils]] article discusses which types of vegetable oil are used for fuel and where different types are grown.

== Transportation ==
Vegetable oil is used for transportation in four different ways:
* [[Vegetable oil blends]] - Mixing vegetable oil with diesel lets users get some of the advantages of burning vegetable oil and is often done with no modification to the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ravenfamily.org/andyg/vegoil.htm|title=Vegetable Oil as Vehicle Fuel|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biodiesel]] - If vegetable oil is [[transesterified]] it becomes [[biodiesel]].  Biodiesel burns like normal diesel and works fine in any diesel engine.  The name just indicates that the fuel came from vegetable oil.
* [[Straight vegetable oil]] -  Straight vegetable oil works in diesel engines if it is heated first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journeytoforever.org/biodiesel_svo.html|title=Straight vegetable oil as diesel fuel|publisher=Journeytoforever.org|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some diesel engines already heat their fuel, others need a small electric heater on the fuel line.  How well it works depends on the heating system, the engine, the type of vegetable oil (thinner is easier), and the climate (warmer is easier).  Some data is available on results users are seeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegetableoildiesel.co.uk/fuelsdatabase/database/index.php|title=Using Vegetable oil as a diesel fuel - database|publisher=Vegetableoildiesel.co.uk|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As vegetable oil has become more popular as a fuel, engines are being designed to handle it better. The [[Elsbett]] engine is designed to run on straight vegetable oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsbett.com/engl/index.htm|title=Pflanzenl Motor Umrstung Rapsl Motor Elsbett Motor - Elsbett AG|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Elsbett.com|accessdate=28 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807131035/http://www.elsbett.com/engl/index.htm|archivedate=7 August 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as of the start of 2007, it seems that there are not any production vehicles warrantied for burning straight vegetable oil, although [[Deutz AG|Deutz]] offer a tractor and [[John Deere tractor|John Deere]] are known to be in late stages of engine development.  There is a German rapeseed oil fuel standard [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] 51605.  At this point straight vegetable oil is only a niche market although the market segment in Germany is rapidly growing with large haulage vehicle fleets adopting the fuel, largely for economic reasons. A growing number of decentralised oil mills provide a large part of this fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stotz | first = Kathrin | author2 = Remmele, Edgar | title = Oil Processing in Decentralised Oil Mills - Results of a Survey | journal = Landtechnik | volume = 60 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–1 | date = 200 | url = http://ltnet.lv-h.de/en/volltext/Lt20051/LT20051E_016_017.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2007-10-25 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vegetable oil refining]] - Vegetable oil can be used as feedstock for an [[oil refinery]].  There it can be transformed into fuel by [[hydrocracking]] (which breaks big molecules into smaller ones using hydrogen) or [[hydrogenation]] (which adds hydrogen to molecules).  These methods can produce [[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], or [[propane]].  Some commercial examples of vegetable oil refining are [[NExBTL]], [[H-Bio]], and the ConocoPhilips Process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2006/12/conocophillips_.html|title=Green Car Congress: ConocoPhillips Begins Production of Renewable Diesel Fuel at Whitegate Refinery|author=BioAge Media|publisher=Greencarcongress.com|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition can start with [[biodiesel]], [[vegetable oil refining]], and [[vegetable oil blends]], since these technologies do not require the capital outlay of converting an engine to run on vegetable oils.  Because it costs to convert vegetable oil into biodiesel it is expected that vegetable oil will always be cheaper than biodiesel.  After there are production cars that can use [[straight vegetable oil]] and a standard type available at gas stations, consumers will probably choose straight vegetable oil to save money.  So the transition to vegetable oil can happen gradually.

== Electricity generation ==
Other methods, like [[nuclear power]], [[fusion power]], [[wind power]] and [[solar power]], may provide cheaper electricity, so vegetable oil may only be used in [[peaking power plant]]s and small power plants, as diesel is limited to today.  There is at least one 5 MW power plant that runs on biodiesel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Texas+power+plant+runs+on+biodiesel/2100-11392_3-6168606.html|title=Texas power plant runs on biodiesel|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MAN B&amp;W Diesel]], [[Wärtsilä]] and other companies produce engines suitable for power generation that can be fueled with [[pure plant oil]]s.

== Market, cost, price, and taxes ==
[[File:Diesel prices.jpg|thumb|In some countries, filling stations sell bio-diesel more cheaply than conventional diesel.]]

In Europe, straight vegetable oil (SVO) costs 150 pence/litre at most supermarkets &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Details/?id=254918067|title=Tesco Pure Vegetable Oil 1 litre : £1.25|publisher=Tesco.com|date=28 December 2014|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and somewhat less when bought in bulk direct from the manufacturers whereas diesel costs at least 130 pence per litre (in the UK &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petrolprices.com/the-price-of-fuel.html|title=The Price of Fuel|publisher=Petrolprices.com|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to well over that (depends on the year, 1.4 euro is the current market price in central Europe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.php?t=520558|title=Use Vegetable Oil If You Have A Diesel Car - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums|work=MoneySavingExpert.com Forums|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, diesel costs about 0,6 $ per liter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dieselearth.com/notebook/bulk-vegetable-oil.html|title=Bulk Vegetable Oil|publisher=Dieselearth.com|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cheapest SVO costs about the same, with more expensive oils costing more than that (up to $7 per gallon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/71108|title=07 March 2012 - Recycled cooking oil flooding local market - News - Features - FACTIVA - SHOWCASE - My Sinchew|publisher=Mysinchew.com|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of [[biodiesel around the World]] is increasing.

From 2005 to 2007 a number of types of vegetable oil have doubled in price. The rise in vegetable oil prices is largely attributed to biofuel demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmersjournal.ie/2007/1117/farmmanagement/crops/index.shtml|title=FARMING - Farming News - Farm Equipment - Farm Machinery - Farm Development - The Irish Farmers Journal|publisher=Farmersjournal.ie|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the fuel price at the pump is due to [[fuel tax]].   If you buy vegetable oil at the grocery store it does not have such high taxes.  So at times people have bought vegetable oil at the store for their cars because it was cheaper.  They did this in spite of the fact that packaging by the gallon adds to the cost and it was illegal to use in a car since no fuel tax had been paid on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/footnmouth/biofuel.html|title=Alistair McConnachie Sovereignty.

Since vegetable oil (even as biodiesel) does not contribute to [[greenhouse gas]], governments may tax it much less than gasoline as they have done with [[ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/110_HR_196.html|title=H.R. 196, The Renewable Fuels and Energy Independence Promotion Act of 2007 - Washington Watch|publisher=Washingtonwatch.com|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 7.5&amp;nbsp;lb/USgal (900 g/L) this is about 38 billion USgallons (144 billion L).  Currently vegetable oil is mostly used in food and some industrial uses with a small percentage used as fuel.  The major fuel usage is by conversion to biodiesel with about {{convert|3|e9USgal|m3}} in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2009/967/Figure7.gif|format=GIF|title=Figure 7|publisher=Federalreserve.gov|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The gradual move from oil has begun. Over the next 15 to 20 years we may see biofuels providing a full 25 percent of the world's energy needs. While the move is good for reducing greenhouse emissions, soaring oil prices have encouraged most countries to 'go green' by switching to greater use of biofuels." - Alexander Müller, Assistant Director-General of Sustainable Development at the FAO.&lt;ref&gt;

==Environmental effects==
{{Main|Social and environmental impact of palm oil}}
[[File:Lacanja burn.JPG|thumb|right|Jungle burned for agriculture in southern Mexico.]]
There is concern that the current growing demand for vegetable oil is causing [[deforestation]], with old forests being replaced with [[oil palm]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2006/0425-oil_palm.html|title=Why is oil palm replacing tropical rainforests|work=Mongabay|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When land is cleared it is often burned, which releases large amounts of the [[greenhouse gas]] [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Vegetable oil production would have to increase substantially to replace gasoline and diesel.  With current technology such an increase in production would have a substantial [[environmental impact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/|title=biofuelwatch|publisher=Biofuelwatch.org.uk|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food vs fuel debate ==
{{Main|Food vs fuel}}
In some poor countries the rising price of vegetable oil is causing problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/19/1982450.htm|title=Biofuel demand makes fried food expensive in Indonesia|work=ABC News|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122012542/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/19/business/palmoil.php|title=The other oil shock: Vegetable oil prices soar|last=Bradsher|first=Keith|date=2008-01-22|website=[[International Herald Tribune]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are those that say using a food crop for fuel sets up competition between food in poor countries and fuel in rich countries.   Some propose that fuel only be made from non-edible vegetable oils like [[jatropha oil]]. Others argue that the problem is more fundamental. The [[law of supply and demand]] predicts that if fewer farmers are producing food the price of food will rise.  It may take some time, as farmers can take some time to change which things they are growing, but increasing demand for biofuels is likely to result in price increases for many kinds of food.  Some have pointed out that there are poor farmers and poor countries making more money because of the higher price of vegetable oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=7216688&amp;story_id=10252015 | title= The Economist – The End Of Cheap Food |publisher=Economist.com|accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the use of non-edible vegetable oils produced by trees such as [[Millettia pinnata|Millettia Pinnata]] (formerly Pongamia Pinnata) or the [[Moringa oleifera]] tree, both which grow on borderline or non-arable land, the food versus fuel debate becomes less of an either/or question. Apart from their facility of growing in non-arable and/or marginal land, these trees offer major advantages over peanut, soy-bean, sunflower, etc., in that they have long lives (up to 100 years), very low maintenance (since the intensive husbandry is limited to the first few years of their producing lives) and can provide cash-crops to rural areas, such as rural India. In the case of Millettia Pinnata and a few others, the fact that they are nitrogen-fixing legumes is another very important factor, in that they do not deplete the soil. Among other benefits of these trees is that they have root-systems that penetrate much deeper and do not compete with shallow-rooted plants, like grass (once the trees have attained a certain maturity). This means that the land can be used for multiple purposes, such as grazing for animals. Yet another benefit of using Millettia Pinnata to produce bio-diesel is that it can tolerate low rainfall (as little as 250 ml per year), far below what most food-crops require, thus reducing yet more their potential to compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millettiaplantations.com/|title=Millettia Pinnata Sustainable Biofuel Crop Of The Future - Millettia Plantations|publisher=Millettiaplantations.com|accessdate=28 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227215637/http://www.millettiaplantations.com/|archivedate=27 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/duke_energy/Pongamia_pinnata.html|title=Pongamia pinnata|publisher=Hort.purdue.edu|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209083615/http://www.winrock.org/fnrm/factnet/factpub/FACTSH/P_pinnata.html|title=Pongamia pinnata - a nitrogen fixing tree for oilseed|last=|first=|date=2007|website=NFT Highlights, a publication of the Forest, Farm, and Community Tree Network (FACT Net)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305110023/http://www.bioenergyresearch.com.au/home/|title=BioEnergy Plantations Australia - Home|last=|first=|date=2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algae for vegetable oil production ==
{{Main|biofuel from algae}}

Some species of algae contain as much as 50% vegetable oil.  Algae have very high growth rates compared to plants normally used to produce vegetable oil. Potentially algae could produce much more oil per area of land than current farming methods.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;   So producing vegetable oil this way should result in less deforestation and less competition for food production land.   One expert wrote: "As demonstrated here, microalgal biodiesel is technically feasible. It is the only renewable biodiesel that can potentially completely displace liquid fuels derived from petroleum. Economics of producing microalgal biodiesel need to improve substantially to make it competitive with petrodiesel, but the level of improvement necessary appears to be attainable.
"&lt;ref name="BiodieselFromMicroAlgae"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chisti |first=Yusuf |title=Biodiesel from microalgae |journal=Biotechnology Advances |volume=25 |year=2007 |issue=25 |pages=294–306 |pmid=17350212 |url=http://dels.nas.edu/banr/gates1/docs/mtg5docs/bgdocs/biodiesel_microalgae.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2007.02.001 |format= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007163313/http://dels.nas.edu/banr/gates1/docs/mtg5docs/bgdocs/biodiesel_microalgae.pdf |archivedate=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there is existing electricity generation using fossil fuels, there is a source of sterile CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This makes [[algaculture]] much easier.  To grow algae you need lots of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but if you get it from air you will also get all kinds of other organisms, some of which eat algae.  Getting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from a smokestack works out really well.  Governments trying to address the [[external costs]] of coal power plants may have a [[carbon tax]] or [[carbon credit]] that provides additional motivation to use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from smokestacks.   Several commercial pilot plants are under construction.&lt;ref name="SmokestackGasTank"&gt;

There is substantial research and development work in this area but as of 2007 there is no commercial vegetable oil produced from algae and used as biofuel. ExxonMobil is investing $600 million and estimates they are 5 to 10 years from significant production, but could invest billions in final development and commercialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/science/08/21/eco.algaebiofuel/index.html | work=CNN | title='Green goo' biofuel gets a boost - CNN.com | accessdate=2010-05-27 | date=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;   If and when the commercialization challenges are overcome, vegetable oil production could expand very rapidly.

In 2012 President Obama supported the idea of getting oil from algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/37538007|title=President Obama Endorses Algae|work=Vimeo|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a telephone call to the [[Human Rights Watch]] in 2004, Iranian journalist [[Ebrahim Nabavi]] made the following claim regarding White torture:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Since I left Evin, I have not been able to sleep without sleeping pills. It is terrible. The loneliness never leaves you, long after you are “free.” Every door that is closed on you ... This is why we call it “white torture.” They get what they want without having to hit you. They know enough about you to control the information that you get: they can make you believe that the president has resigned, that they have your wife, that someone you trust has told them lies about you.

John McGuffin's book "The Guinea Pigs" details the use of sensory deprivation used in Northern Ireland by the British Army until the UK conviction in 1971 of torture before the European Court in the Hague, later downgraded to "severe maltreatment".{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
This consisted of hooding and dressing in thick boiler suits and being made to stand against a wall on tip-toe and being subject to "white noise". This technique was developed largely in order to avoid accusations of torture (by not inflicting physical pain, but an absence of stimulus) while still providing an interrogation tool. The antecedents of this had been experiments carried out in Canada on volunteers, ostensibly in support of a manned space programme.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These had to be discontinued due to the severity of the psychiatric symptoms induced.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
The UK Government brought together experience of previous torture carried out in various colonial wars - Fort Morbut in Yemen, Hola Camp in Kenya and in Cyprus - in a conference held at Ashford Joint Intelligence Centre in Kent.

[[File:Command Fishing Services 2014-05-18 23-29.jpg|thumbnail|Wireline truck rigged up to a drilling rig in Canada]]

In the [[petroleum industry|oil and gas industry]], the term '''wireline''' usually refers to a [[cabling]] technology used by operators of [[Oil well|oil and gas wells]] to lower equipment or measurement devices into the well for the purposes of [[well intervention]], reservoir evaluation, and [[pipe recovery operations|pipe recovery.]]

Tools inserted into the well for both [[workover]] and logging efforts, wirelines and [[slickline|slicklines]] are very similar devices. While a slickline is a thin cable introduced into a well to deliver and retrieve tools downhole, a wireline is an electrical cable used to lower tools into and transmit data about the conditions of the wellbore called wireline logs. Usually consisting of braided cables, wirelines are used to perform wireline logging, as well.

Braided line can contain an inner core of insulated wires which provide power to equipment located at the end of the cable, normally referred to as electric line, and provides a pathway for electrical [[telemetry]] for communication between the surface and equipment at the end of the cable.

==Slicklines==
[[File:Pipe Recovery Wireline Truck.jpg|320x240px|right|thumb|Wireline truck]]

Used to place and recover wellbore equipment, such as plugs, gauges and valves, slicklines are single-strand non-electric cables lowered into oil and gas wells from the surface. Slicklines can also be used to adjust valves and sleeves located downhole, as well as repair tubing within the wellbore.

Wrapped around a drum on the back of a truck, the slickline is raised and lowered in the well by reeling in and out the wire hydraulically.

Braided line can contain an inner core of insulated wires which provide power to equipment located at the end of the cable, normally referred to as electric line, and provides a pathway for electrical [[telemetry]] for communication between the surface and equipment at the end of the cable.
[[File:Inside Weatherfords Wireline truck.JPG|thumb|Inside a Wireline truck]]

On the other hand, wirelines are electric cables that transmit data about the well. Consisting of single strands or multi-strands, the wireline is used for both well intervention and formation evaluation operations. In other words, wirelines are useful in gathering data about the well in logging activities, as well as in workover jobs that require data transmittal.

==Wireline logs==

First developed by Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger in 1927, wireline logs measure formation properties in a well through electrical lines of wire. Different from [[measurement while drilling]] (MWD) and mud logs, wireline logs are constant downhole measurements sent through the electrical wireline used to help geologists, drillers and engineers make real-time decisions about drilling operations. Wireline logs can measure resistivity, conductivity and formation pressure, as well as sonic properties and wellbore dimensions.

The logging tool, also called a [[wikt:sonde|sonde]], is located at the bottom of the wireline. The measurements are taken by lowering the wireline to the prescribed depth and then raising it out of the well. The measurements are taken continuously on the way up, in an effort to sustain tension on the line.

==Workover operations==

When producing wells require remedial work to sustain, restore or enhance production, this is called workover. Many times, workover operations require production shut-in, but not always.

==Slickline firing head system==

In workover operations, a well-servicing unit is used to winch items in and out of the wellbore. The line used to raise and lower equipment can be braided steel wireline or a single steel slickline. Workover operations conducted can include well clean-up, setting plugs, production logging and perforation through explosives.

==Wireline tools==

Wireline tools are specially designed instruments lowered into a well bore on the end of the wireline cable. They are individually designed to provide any number of particular services, such as evaluation of the rock properties, the location of casing collars, formation pressures, information regarding the pore size or fluid identification and sample recovery. Modern wireline tools can be extremely complicated, and are often engineered to withstand very harsh conditions such as those found in many modern oil, gas, and geothermal wells. Pressures in gas wells can exceed 30,000 psi, while temperatures can exceed 500 deg Fahrenheit in some geothermal wells. Corrosive or carcinogenic gases such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] can also occur downhole.

To reduce the amount of time running in the well, several wireline tools are often joined together and run simultaneously in a tool string that can be hundreds of feet long and weigh more than 5000 lbs.

=== Natural gamma ray tools ===
Natural gamma ray tools are designed to measure gamma radiation in the Earth caused by the disintegration of naturally occurring potassium, uranium, and thorium. Unlike nuclear tools, these natural gamma ray tools emit no radiation. The tools have a radiation sensor, which is usually a scintillation crystal that emits a light pulse proportional to the strength of the gamma ray striking it. This light pulse is then converted to a current pulse by means of a photomultiplier tube (PMT). From the photomultiplier tube, the current pulse goes to the tool's electronics for further processing and ultimately to the surface system for recording. The strength of the received gamma rays is dependent on the source emitting gamma rays, the density of the formation, and the distance between the source and the tool detector. The log recorded by this tool is used to identify [[lithology]], estimate shale content, and depth correlation of future logs.

=== Nuclear tools ===
[[File:Putting the radioactive charge in the wireline string.JPG|thumb|Putting the radioactive charge in the wireline string]]
[[File:Locked case for Radioactive Source for Logging Job.JPG|thumb|Locked case for radioactive source for logging job]]
Nuclear tools measure formation properties through the interaction of reservoir molecules with radiation emitted from the logging tool. The two most common properties measured by nuclear tools are formation porosity and rock density: 

Formation porosity is determined by installing a [[neutron source|radiation source capable of emitting fast neutrons]] into the downhole environment. Any pore spaces in the rock are filled with fluid containing hydrogen atoms, which slow the neutrons down to an epithermal or thermal state. This atomic interaction creates gamma rays which are then measured in the tool through dedicated detectors, and interpreted through a calibration to a porosity. A higher number of gamma rays collected at the tool sensor would indicate a larger number of interactions with hydrogen atoms, and thus a larger porosity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slb.com/content/services/evaluation/petrophysics/porosity/cnl.asp Schlumberger, Compensated Neutron Log&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508160819/http://www.slb.com/content/services/evaluation/petrophysics/porosity/cnl.asp |date=2008-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most open hole nuclear tools utilize double-encapsulated chemical sources.

Density tools use gamma ray radiation to determine the lithology and density of the rock in the downhole environment.  Modern density tools utilize a Cs-137 radioactive source to generate gamma rays which interact with the rock strata. Since higher density materials absorb gamma rays much better than lower density materials, a gamma ray detector in the wire line tool is able to accurately determine formation density by measuring the number and associated energy level of returning gamma rays that have interacted with the rock matrix.  Density tools usually incorporate an extendable caliper arm, which is used both to press the radioactive source and detectors against the side of the bore and also to measure the exact width of the bore in order to remove the effect of varying bore diameter on the readings.

Some modern nuclear tools use an electronically powered source controlled from the surface to generate neutrons. By emitting neutrons of varying energies, the logging engineer is able to determine formation lithology in fractional percentages.

=== Resistivity tools ===
In any matrix which has some porosity, the pore spaces will be filled with a fluid of oil, gas (either hydrocarbon or otherwise) or formation water (sometimes referred to as connate water). This fluid will saturate the rock and change its electrical properties. A wireline resistivity tool direct injects current (lateralog-type tools for conductive water based muds) or induces (induction-type tools for resistive or oil based muds) an electric current into the surrounding rock and determines the resistivity via Ohm's law. The resistivity of the formation is used primarily to identify pay zones containing highly resistive hydrocarbons as opposed to those containing water, which is generally more conductive. It is also useful for determining the location of the [[water contact|oil-water contact]] in a reservoir. Most wireline tools are able to measure the resistivity at several depths of investigation into the bore hole wall, allowing log analysts to accurately predict the level of fluid invasion from the drilling mud, and thus determine a qualitative measurement of permeability.

Some resistivity tools have many electrodes mounted on several articulated pads, allowing for multiple micro-resistivity measurements. These micro-resistivities have a very shallow depth of investigation, typically in the range of 0.1 to 0.8 inches, making them suitable for borehole imaging. Resistivity imagers are available which operate using induction methods for resistive mud systems (oil base), and direct current methods for conductive mud systems (water based).

=== Sonic and ultrasonic tools ===
Sonic tools, such as the Baker Hughes XMAC-F1, consist of multiple piezoelectric transducers and receivers mounted on the tool body at fixed distances. The transmitters generate a pattern of sound waves at varying operating frequencies into the down hole formation. The signal path leaves the transmitter, passes through the mud column, travels along the borehole wall and is collected at multiple receivers spaced out along the tool body. The time it takes for the sound wave to travel through the rock is dependent on a number of properties of the existing rock, including formation porosity, lithology, permeability and rock strength. Different types of pressure waves can be generated in specific axis, allowing geoscientists to determine anisotropic stress regimes. This is very important in determining hole stability and aids drilling engineers in planning for future well design.

Sonic tools are also used extensively to evaluate the cement bond between casing and formation in a completed well, primarily by calculating the accentuation of the signal after it as passed through the casing wall (see [[#Cement Bond Tools|Cement Bond Tools]] below).

Ultrasonic tools use a rotating acoustic transducer to map a 360 degree image of the borehole as the logging tool is pulled to surface. This is especially useful for determining small scale bedding and formation dip, as well as identifying drilling artifacts such as spiraling or induced fractures.

=== Nuclear magnetic resonance tools ===
A measurement of the [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) properties of hydrogen in the formation. There are two phases to the measurement: polarization and acquisition. First, the hydrogen atoms are aligned in the direction of a static magnetic field (B0). This polarization takes a characteristic time T1. Second, the hydrogen atoms are tipped by a short burst from an oscillating magnetic field that is designed so that they precess in resonance in a plane perpendicular to B0. The frequency of oscillation is the Larmor frequency. The precession of the hydrogen atoms induces a signal in the antenna. The decay of this signal with time is caused by transverse relaxation and is measured by the [http://www.mr-tip.com/serv1.php?type=db1&amp;dbs=Carr%20Purcell%20Meiboom%20Gill%20Sequence CPMG pulse sequence]. The decay is the sum of different decay times, called T2. The T2 distribution is the basic output of a NMR measurement.

The NMR measurement made by both a laboratory instrument and a logging tool follow the same principles very closely. An important feature of the NMR measurement is the time needed to acquire it. In the laboratory, time presents no difficulty. In a log, there is a trade-off between the time needed for polarization and acquisition, logging speed and frequency of sampling. The longer the polarization and acquisition, the more complete the measurement. However, the longer times require either lower logging speed or less frequent sampling.

=== Borehole seismic tools ===

===Cased hole electric line tools===

====Cement bond tools====
A [[cement bond tool]], or CBT, is an [[acoustics|acoustic]] tool used to measure the quality of the cement behind the [[casing (borehole)|casing]].  Using a CBT, the bond between the casing and cement as well as the bond between cement and formation can be determined.  Using CBT data, a company can troubleshoot problems with the cement sheath if necessary.  This tool must be centralized in the well to function properly.

Two of the largest problems found in cement by CBT's are channeling and micro-annulus.  A micro annulus is the formation of microscopic cracks in the cement sheath.  Channeling is where large, contiguous voids in the cement sheath form, typically caused by poor centralization of the casing.  Both of these situations can, if necessary, be fixed by remedial electric line work.

A CBT makes its measurements by rapidly pulsing out [[compressional wave]]s across the well bore and into the pipe, cement, and formation.  The compressional pulse originates in a [[transmitter]] at the top of the tool, which, when powered up on surface sounds like a rapid clicking sound.  The tool typically has two receivers, one three feet away from the receiver, and another at five feet from the transmitter.  These receivers record the arrival time of the compressional waves. The information from these receivers are logged as traveltimes for the three and five foot receivers and as a micro-[[seismogram]].

Recent advances in logging technologies have allowed the receivers to measure 360 degrees of cement integrity and can be represented on a log as a radial cement map and as 6-8 individual sector arrival times.

====Casing collar locators====
Casing collar locator tools, or CCL's, are among the simplest and most essential in cased hole electric line.  CCL's are typically used for depth correlation and can be an indicator of line overspeed when logging in heavy fluids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coiledtubingdrilling.com/ctd/coiled-tubing/technology/] AnTech CCL Tool within CTD Offering&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:CCL Log.png|thumb|CCL Log]]
A CCL operates on [[Faraday's Law of Induction]].  Two magnets are separated by a coil of copper wire.  As the CCL passes by a casing joint, or collar, the difference in metal thickness across the two magnets induces a current spike in the coil.  This current spike is sent uphole and logged as what's called a collar kick on the cased hole log.&lt;ref&gt;http://wirelinehq.com/wireline-basics/wireline-casing-collar-locator/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gamma perforating tools====
A cased hole gamma perforator is used to perform mechanical services, such as shooting [[Perforation (oil well)|perforations]], setting downhole tubing/casing elements, dumping remedial cement, tracer surveys, etc.  Typically, a gamma perforator will have some sort of explosively initiated device attached to it, such as a perforating gun, a setting tool, or a dump bailor.  In certain instances, the gamma perforator is used to merely spot objects in the well, as in tubing conveyed perforating operations and tracer surveys.

Gamma perforators operate in much the same way as an open hole natural gamma ray tool.  Gamma rays given off from naturally occurring radioactive elements bombard the scintillation detector mounted on the tool.  The tool processes the gamma ray counts and sends the data uphole where it processed by a computerized acquisition system, and plotted on a log versus depth.  The information is then used to ensure that the depth shown on the log is correct.  After that, power can be applied through the tool to set off explosive charges for things like perforating, setting plugs or packers, dumping cement, etc.

====Wireline pressure setting assemblies (WLSPA)====
Setting tools are used to set downhole completion elements such as production packers or bridge plugs.  Setting tools typically use the expanding gas energy from a slow burning explosive charge to drive a hydraulic piston assembly. The assembly is attached to the plug or packer by means of a setting mandrel and a sliding sleeve, which when "stroked" by the piston assembly, effectively squeezes the elastomer elements of the packing element, deforming it sufficiently to wedge it into place in the tubing or casing string. Most completion packers or plugs have a specially designed shear mechanism which release the setting tool from the element allowing it to be retrieved back to surface. The packer/plug however, remains down hole as a barrier to isolate production zones or permanently plug off a well bore.

==Additional equipment==

===Cable head===
The cable head is the upper most portion of the toolstring on any given type of wireline.  The cable head is where the conductor wire is made into an electrical connection that can be connected to the rest of the toolstring.  Cable heads are typically custom built by the wireline operator for every job and depend greatly on depth, pressure and the type of wellbore fluid.

Electric line weakpoints are also located in the cable head.  If the tool is to become stuck in the well, the weak point is where the tool would first separate from the wireline.  If the wireline were severed anywhere else along the line, the tool becomes much more difficult to fish.&lt;ref&gt;http://wirelinehq.com/wireline-basics/cablehead/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tractors===
Tractors are electrical tools used to push the toolstring into hole, overcoming wireline's disadvantage of being gravity dependent.  These are used for in highly deviated and horizontal wells where gravity is insufficient, even with roller stem.  They push against the side of the wellbore either through the use of wheels or through a wormlike motion.

===Measuring head===

A measuring head is the first piece of equipment the wireline comes into contact with off the drum.  The measuring head is composed of several wheels which support the wireline on its way to the winch and they also measure crucial wireline data.

A measuring head records tension, depth, and speed.  Current models use optical encoders to derive the revolutions of a wheel with a known circumference, which in turn is used to figure speed and depth.  A wheel with a pressure sensor is used to figure tension.

==Wireline apparatus==
[[File:wireline-wellhead.jpg|thumbnail|Wireline-wellhead]]
For [[oilfield]] work, the wireline resides on the surface, wound around a large (3 to 10 feet in diameter) spool. Operators may use a portable spool (on the back of a special truck) or a permanent part of the [[drilling rig]].  A motor and drive train turn the spool and raise and lower the equipment into and out of the well &amp;ndash; the [[winch]].

==Pressure control during wireline operations==
The pressure control employed during wireline operations is intended to contain pressure originating from the well bore.  During open hole electric line operations, the pressure might be the result from a well kicking.  During cased hole electric line, this is most likely the result of a well producing at high pressures.  Pressure equipment must be rated to well over the expected well pressures.  Normal ratings for wireline pressure equipment is 5,000, 10,000, and 15,000 pounds per square inch. Some wells are contained with 20,000 psi and 30,000 psi equipment is in development also.

===Flange===

A flange attaches to the top of the Christmas tree, usually with some sort of adapter for the rest of the pressure control.  A metal gasket is placed between the top of the Christmas tree and the flange to keep in well pressures.

===Wireline valve===

A wireline control valve, also called a wireline blow out preventer(BOP), is an enclosed device with one or more rams capable of closing over the wireline in an emergency.  A dual wireline valve has two sets of rams and some have the capability of pumping grease in the space between the rams to counterbalance the well pressure.

===Lubricator===
Lubricator is the term used for sections of pressure tested pipe that act to seal in wireline tools during pressurization.
As stated it is a series of pipes that connect and it is what holds the tool string so operators can make runs in and out of the well. It has valves to bleed off pressure so that you can disconnect it from the well and work on tools, etc.

===Pump-in sub===
Pump-in subs (also known as a flow T) allow for the injection of fluid into the pressure control string.  Normally these are used for wellsite pressure testing, which is typically performed between every run into the well.  They can also be used to bleed off pressure from the string after a run in the well, or to pump in kill fluids to control a wild well.
[[File:Wireline Grease-head.JPG|thumb|Wireline Greasehead used for pressure control]]

===Grease injector head===
The grease injector head is the main apparatus for controlling well pressure while running into the hole.  The grease head uses a series of very small pipes, called flow tubes, to decrease the pressure head of the well.  Grease is injected at high pressure into the bottom portion of the grease head to counteract the remaining well pressure.

===Pack-off===
Pack-off subs utilize hydraulic pressure on a two brass fittings which compress a rubber sealing element to create a seal around the wireline.  Pack-offs can be hand pumped or compressed through a motorized pumping unit.
[[File:Pack-off.png|thumb|Wireline Roller-top Pack-off]]

===Line wiper===
A line wiper operates in much the same way as a pack-off sub, except that the rubber element is much softer.  Hydraulic pumps exert force on the rubber element until a light pressure is exerted on the wireline, cleaning grease and well fluid off the line in the process.

===Quick test sub===
A quick test sub (QTS) is used when pressure testing the pressure control equipment (PCE) for repetitive operations. The PCE is pressure tested and then broke at the QTS afterwards to avoid having to retest the entire string. The PCE is then reconnected at the QTS. The QTS has two O-rings where it was disconnected that can be tested with hydraulic pressure to confirm the PCE can still hold the pressure it was tested to.

===Ball-check valve===
If the wireline were to become severed from the tool, a ball check valve can seal the well off from the surface.  During wireline operations, a steel ball sits to the side of a confined area within the grease head while the cable runs in and out of the hole.  If the wireline exits that confined area under pressure, the pressure will force the steel ball up towards the hole where the wireline had been.  The ball's diameter is larger than that of the hole, so the ball effectively seals off pressure to the surface.

===Head catcher===
A head catcher is a device placed at the top of the lubricator section.  Should the wireline tools be forced into the top of the lubricator section, the head catcher, which looks like a small 'claw,' will clamp down on the fishing neck of the tool.  This action prevents the tools from falling downhole should the line pull out of the rope socket.  Pressure is bled off of the head catcher to release the tools.

===Tool trap===
A tool trap has the same purpose as a head catcher in that it prevents the tools from inadvertently dropping down the hole.
