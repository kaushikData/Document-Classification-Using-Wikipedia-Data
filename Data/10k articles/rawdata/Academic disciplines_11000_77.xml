'''Artificial seawater''' ([[abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''ASW''') is a mixture of dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|mineral salts]] (and sometimes [[vitamin]]s) that simulates [[seawater]]. Artificial seawater is primarily used in [[marine biology]] and in [[marine aquarium|marine]] and [[reef aquarium|reef aquaria]], and allows the easy preparation of [[growth medium|media]] appropriate for marine [[organism]]s (including [[algae]], [[bacteria]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s). From a [[scientific method|scientific perspective]], artificial seawater has the advantage of [[reproducibility]] over natural seawater since it is a standardized formula. Synthetic seawater is also known as artificial seawater and substitute ocean water. 

==Example==
The tables below present an example of an artificial seawater (35.00[[Per mille|‰]] of salinity) preparation devised by Kester, Duedall, Connors and Pytkowicz (1967).&lt;ref&gt;Kester, D.

''Limnology &amp; Oceanography'' '''12''', 176—179.&lt;/ref&gt;  The recipe consists of two lists of mineral salts, the first of [[anhydrous]] salts that can be weighed out, the second of [[hydrate|hydrous]] salts that should be added to the artificial seawater as a solution.

==Standard==
The International Standard for making Artificial Seawater can be found at [[ASTM International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D1141.htm |title=Standard Practice for the Preparation of Substitute Ocean Water |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=ASTM International |publisher= |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current standard is named ASTM D1141-98 (the original standard was ASTM D1141-52) and describes the standard practice for the preparation of substitute ocean water. 

==Uses==
There are various applications for ASTM D1141-98 synthetic seawater including [[corrosion]] studies, ocean [[Calibration#Instrument calibration|instrument calibration]] and chemical processing. Typically, laboratory grade water is used when making synthetic salts &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.g2mtlabs.com/artificial-seawater-aka-synthetic-seawater-substitute-ocean-water-astm-d1141-salts-solutions/

The '''Atwater system''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authors=D.A.T. Southgate, A.R.C. Food Research Institute, Norwich, UK|date=October 1981| url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/M2847E/M2847E00.HTM| accessdate=2006-03-09| title=The Relationship Between Food composition and Available Energy| work=Provisional Agenda Item 4.1.3, Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation on Energy and Protein Requirements, Rome, 5 to 17 October 1981| publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations, [[World Health Organization]], The [[United Nations University]]| id=ESN: FAO/WHO/UNU EPR/81/41 August 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Wilbur Olin Atwater]], or derivatives of this system are used for the calculation of the available energy of foods. The system was developed largely from the experimental studies of Atwater and his colleagues in the later part of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th at [[Wesleyan University]] in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]. Its use has frequently been the cause of dispute, but no real alternatives have been proposed. As with the calculation of protein from total nitrogen, the Atwater system is a convention and its limitations can be seen in its derivation.

==Derivation==
Available energy (as used by Atwater) is equivalent to the modern usage of the term [[Metabolisable Energy|metabolisable energy]] (ME).

&lt;math&gt;{\text{Metabolisable Energy}} = \left(\text{Gross Energy in Food}\right) - \left(\text{Energy lost in Faeces, Urine, Secretions and Gases}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In most studies on humans, losses in secretions and gases are ignored. The gross energy (GE) of a food, as measured by [[Calorimeter#Bomb calorimeters|bomb]] [[calorimetry]] is equal to the sum of the [[Heat of combustion|heats of combustion]] of the components – [[protein]] (GE&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), fat (GE&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbohydrate]] (GE&lt;sub&gt;cho&lt;/sub&gt;) (by difference) in the proximate system.

&lt;math&gt;{GE} = {{GE}_p + {GE}_f + {GE}_{cho}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Atwater considered the energy value of feces in the same way.

&lt;math&gt;{GE}^F = {{GE}_p^F + {GE}_f^F + {GE}_{cho}^F}  \,&lt;/math&gt;

By measuring [[coefficients of availability]] or in modern terminology [[apparent digestibility]], Atwater derived a system for calculating faecal energy losses.

&lt;math&gt;\text{Digestible energy} = {{GE}_p(D_p)} + {{GE}_f(D_f)} + {{GE}_{cho}(D_{cho})}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''D&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''D&lt;sub&gt;cho&lt;/sub&gt;'' are respectively the digestibility coefficients of protein, fat and carbohydrate calculated as

&lt;math&gt;\frac {\text{intake}-\text{faecal excretion}}{\text{intake}}&lt;/math&gt;

for the constituent in question.

Urinary losses were calculated from the energy to nitrogen ratio in urine. Experimentally this was 7.9 kcal/g (33 kJ/g) urinary nitrogen and thus his equation for metabolisable energy became

&lt;math&gt;{ME} = \left ( {GE}_p - \frac {7.9} {6.25} \right ) D_p + {GE}_f D_f + {GE}_{cho} D_{cho}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Gross energy values===
Atwater collected values from the literature and also measured the heat of combustion of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. These vary slightly depending on sources and Atwater derived weighted values for the gross heat of combustion of the protein, fat and carbohydrate in the typical mixed diet of his time. It has been argued that these weighted values are invalid for individual foods and for diets whose composition in terms of foodstuffs is different from those eaten in the USA in the early 20th century.

===Apparent digestibility coefficients===
Atwater measured a large number of digestibility coefficients for simple mixtures, and in substitution experiments derived values for individual foods. These he combined in a weighted fashion to derive values for mixed diets. When these were tested experimentally with mixed diets they did not give a good prediction, and Atwater adjusted the coefficients for mixed diets.

===Urinary correction===
The energy/nitrogen ratio in urine shows considerable variation and the energy/organic matter is less variable, but the energy/nitrogen value provided Atwater with a workable approach although this has caused some confusion and only applies for subjects in nitrogen balance.

==Modified system==
Based on the work of Atwater, it became common practice to calculate energy content of foods using 4 kcal/g for carbohydrates and proteins and 9 kcal/g for [[lipid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bijal Trivedi|title=The calorie delusion: Why food labels are wrong|journal=New Scientist|date=Jul 15, 2009|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327171-200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was later improved by [[Annabel Merrill]] and [[Bernice Watt]] of the [[USDA]], who derived a system whereby specific calorie conversion factors for different foods were proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annabel Merrill|author2=Bernice Watt|title=Energy Values of Food ... basis and derivation|date=1973|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/Classics/ah74.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122060858/https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Data/Classics/ah74.pdf|archivedate=Nov 22, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This takes cognizance of the fact that first the gross energy values of the protein, fats and carbohydrates from different food sources are different, and second, that the apparent digestibility of the components of different foods is different.

This system relies on having measured heats of combustion of a wide range of isolated proteins, fats and carbohydrates. It also depends on data from digestibility studies, where individual foods have been substituted for basal diets in order to measure the apparent digestibility coefficients for those foods. This approach is based on the assumption that there are no interactions between foods in a mixture in the intestine, and from a practical view point, such studies with humans are difficult to control with the required accuracy.

==Assumptions based on the use of carbohydrates by difference and the effects of dietary fibre==
The carbohydrate by difference approach presents several problems. First, it does not distinguish between sugars, starch and the unavailable carbohydrates (roughage, or "[[dietary fibre]]").

This affects first the gross energy that is assigned to carbohydrate—sucrose has a heat of combustion of 3.95&amp;nbsp;kcal/g (16.53&amp;nbsp;kJ/g) and starch 4.15&amp;nbsp;kcal/g (17.36&amp;nbsp;kJ/g).

Secondly it does not provide for the fact that sugars and starch are virtually completely digested and absorbed, and thus provide metabolisable energy equivalent to their heat of combustion.

The unavailable carbohydrates (dietary fibre) are degraded to a variable extent in the large bowel. The products of this microbial digestion are fatty acids, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (carbon dioxide), methane and hydrogen. The fatty acids (acetate, butyrate and propionate) are absorbed in the large intestine and provide some metabolisable energy. The extent of degradation depends on the source of the dietary fibre (its composition and state of division), and the individual consuming the dietary fibre. There is insufficient data to give firm guidance on the energy available from this source.

Finally dietary fibre affects faecal losses of nitrogen and fat. Whether the increased fat loss is due to an effect on small intestinal absorption is not clear. The increased faecal nitrogen losses on high fibre diets are probably due to an increased bacterial nitrogen content of the faeces. Both these effects however lead to reductions in apparent digestibility, and therefore  the Atwater system warrants small changes in the proper energy conversion factors for those diets.

==Theoretical and practical considerations relating to the calculation of energy values==

===Variations in heats of combustion of food constituents===

====Proteins====
The experimental evidence for the magnitude of this variation is very limited, but as the heats of combustion of the individual amino-acids are different it is reasonable to expect variations between different proteins. An observed range of from 5.48 for conglutin (from blue lupin) to 5.92 for Hordein (barley) was reported, which compares with Atwaters’ range of 5.27 for gelatin to 5.95 for wheat gluten. It is difficult to calculate expected values for a protein from amino-acid data, as some of the heats of combustion are not known accurately. Preliminary calculations on cow's milk suggest a value of around 5.5 kcal/g (23.0 kJ/g).

====Fats====
Analogously the experimental evidence is limited, but since the fatty acids differ in their heats of combustion one should expect fats to vary in heats of combustion. These differences are, however, relatively small – for example, breast milk fat has a calculated heat of combustion of 9.37 kcal/g (39.2 kJ/g) compared with that of cow milk fat of 9.19 kcal/g (38.5 kJ/g).

====Carbohydrates====
Monosaccharides have heats of combustion of around 3.75 kcal/g (15.7 kJ/g), disaccharides 3.95 kcal/g (16.5 kJ/g) and ''polysaccharides 4.15 to 4.20 kcal/g (17.4 to 17.6 kJ/g)''. The heat of hydrolysis is very small and these values are essentially equivalent when calculated on a monosaccharide basis. Thus 100 g sucrose gives on hydrolysis 105.6 g monosaccharide and 100 g starch gives on hydrolysis 110 g glucose.

===Apparent digestibility coefficients===
The human digestive tract is a very efficient organ, and the faecal excretion of nitrogenous material and fats is a small proportion (usually less than 10%) of the intake. Atwater recognised that the faecal excretion was a complex mixture of unabsorbed intestinal secretions, bacterial material and metabolites, sloughed mucosal cells, mucus, and only to a small extent, unabsorbed dietary components. This might be one reason why he chose to use ''availability'' rather than ''digestibility''. His view was that these faecal constituents were truly unavailable and that his apparent disregard of the nature of faecal excretion was justifiable in a practical context.

The ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac {\text{intake}-\text{faecal excretion}}{ \text{intake}},&lt;/math&gt; wherever faecal excretion is small, will approximate to unity and thus these ''coefficients'' have a low variance and have the appearance of constants. This is spurious since faecal excretion is variable even on a constant diet, and there is no evidence to suggest that faecal excretion is in fact related to intake in the way implied by these coefficients.

===Practical considerations in calculations of energy value of foods and diets===
The calculation of energy values must be regarded as an alternative to direct measurement, and therefore is likely to be associated with some inaccuracy when compared with direct assessment. These inaccuracies arise for a number of reasons

* Variations in [[food composition]]: Foods are biological mixtures and as such show considerable variation in composition, particularly in respect of water and fat content. This means that compositional values quoted for representative samples of foods in [[food composition table]]s do not necessarily apply to individual samples of foods. In studies where great accuracy is required, samples of the food consumed must be analysed.
* Measurements of food intake: In estimating energy intakes, measurements of food intake are made, and these are known to be subject to considerable uncertainty. Even in studies under very close supervision the errors in weighing individual food items are rarely less than ±5%. A certain degree of pragmatism must therefore be used when assessing procedures for calculating energy intakes, and many authors impute greater accuracy to quoted calculated energy intakes than is justifiable.
* Individual variation: Variations in individuals are seen in all human studies, and these variations are not allowed for in most calculations.

The theoretical and physiological objections to the assumptions inherent in the Atwater system are likely to result in errors much smaller than these practical matters. Conversion factors were derived from experimental studies with young infants, but these produced values for metabolisable energy intake that were insignificantly different from those obtained by direct application of the modified Atwater factors.

The initial development of COPASI was funded by the [[Virginia Bioinformatics Institute]], and the [[Klaus Tschira Foundation]]. Current development efforts are supported by grants from the [[National Institute of Health]], the [[BBSRC]], and the German Ministry of Education.

== Development team ==
COPASI is the result of an international collaboration between the [[University of Manchester]] (UK), the [[University of Heidelberg]] (Germany), and the [[Virginia Bioinformatics Institute]] (USA). The project principal investigators are [[Pedro Pedrosa Mendes|Pedro Mendes]] and Ursula Kummer. The chief software architects are Stefan Hoops and Sven Sahle.

== Features ==
COPASI includes features to define models of biological processes, simulate and analyze these models, generate analysis reports, and import/export models in [[SBML|SBML format]].

* '''Model definition''':  Models are defined as [[chemical reactions]] between molecular species. The dynamics of the model is determined by [[Rate law]] associated with individual reactions. Models can also include compartments, events, and other global variables that can help specify the dynamics of the system. 
* '''Tasks''': Tasks are different types of analysis that can be performed on a model. They include [[Steady state (chemistry)|steady-state analysis]], [[Stochiometry|stoichiometric analysis]], time course simulation using deterministic and stochastic simulation algorithms, [[metabolic control analysis]], computation of [[Lyapunov exponent]], time scale separation, parameter scans, optimization, and parameter estimation. 
* '''Importing and Exporting''': COPASI can read models in  [[SBML]] format as well as in Gepasi format. COPASI can write models in several different formats including the [[SBML]], source code in the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language, [[Berkeley Madonna]] files, and [http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html XPPAUT] files.

The '''Center for European Integration Studies''' (Zentrum für Europäische Integrationsforschung, ZEI) is an interdisciplinary research and post-graduate education institute at the [[University of Bonn]], [[Germany]], based in its Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Law. ZEI has participated in research, policy advice, and dialogue between science and practice since its establishment in 1995. ZEI also offers [[graduate education]] and mid-career training opportunities to contribute to the resolution of unresolved issues of [[European integration]] and the shaping of [[Europe]]'s global role.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wissenschaftsregion-bonn.de/zentrum-integrationsforschung.html&lt;/ref&gt; ZEI directors are Prof. Dr. [[Ludger Kühnhardt]] and Prof. Dr. Christian Koenig.

==Background and Structure==
The [[Berlin-Bonn Act]] of May 29, 1994–dealing with the consequence of the move of Germany’s national political institutions from [[Bonn]] to [[Berlin]] - provided for the establishment of a "Center for European Integration Studies” (ZEI) and a "Center for Development Research” (ZEF) as central scientific institutions of the University of Bonn. On May 4, 1995 the Senate of the University of Bonn agreed to establish these two centers. The overall concept was formulated in consultation with the participating organs of the federal government and the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. It is based on an original proposal of the Senate of the University of Bonn from February 11, 1993. The Senate decision of May 4, 1995 is considered the founding date of the "Center for European Integration Studies" (ZEI) and the "Center for Development Research." (ZEF)

According to the founding resolution of the Senate of the University of Bonn of May 4, 1995, the tasks of ZEI are as follows: "ZEI will function as a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary institution aimed working on problems in the areas of political, legal, economic, social and cultural [[social integration|integration]] disparities in a regional and pan-European context. ZEI will conduct basic research in the conceptual area that encourages integration of research and to coordinate these efforts within the University and externally. ZEI is to take part in the solutions of concrete problems of integration by offering practical advice. All in all ZEI sees itself as a platform for the discussion of policy issues, a place to develop concepts, hypotheses and models. As an interface between theory and practice, ZEI focuses on institutional- and capacity-building in the field of integration research in Europe. ZEI can only realize its aforementioned goals through consistent openness to the public, through inclusion of guest researchers and through close cooperation with non-university institutions to integrate research, practice and integration of the [[European Union]].”{{cn|date=September 2011}}

==Research and Post-Graduate (Master)Education==
The Center for European Integration Studies (ZEI) provides future oriented research on unresolved issues of European integration and the global role of Europe. ZEI’s research and teaching emphasis on “Governance and Regulation in the EU” brings together two aspects whose critical interplay shapes the EU, its impact on citizens’ lives and its role globally. The work of ZEI - basically in the fields of political science and law -  is applied and linked with innovative knowledge transfer. The dynamic interplay between governance and regulation in the EU serves as the touch stone for research, teaching and consulting work conducted at ZEI.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zei.uni-bonn.de/about-zei?set_language=en&lt;/ref&gt;

ZEI offers postgraduate students an English-speaking Master in European Studies - Governance and Regulation.  An international faculty from across Europe guarantees highest scholarly standards, offering diverse methods and perspectives on politics, law and economics. Practical experts and excursions to the decision-making centers of European politics add to the international atmosphere at ZEI in Bonn.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zei.uni-bonn.de/education/faculty&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
ZEI publishes in its own series: "ZEI Discussion Paper", the "Future of Europe Observer", and "ZEI Insights" deal with issues of governance and regulation in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zei.uni-bonn.de/publications&lt;/ref&gt;  ZEI also monitors the work of the European Union's institutions and publishes regular comments on progress or failure, including the "ZEI Monitor".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zei.uni-bonn.de/research/governance-and-regulation?set_language=en&lt;/ref&gt; ZEI scholars also contribute regularly to national and international publications. * Nomos Publishing House (Baden-Baden) publishes the “Schriften des Zentrum für Europäische Integrationsforschung,” edited by ZEI Director Prof. Dr. Ludger Kühnhardt. Until 2016, there have been 76 books published in this series. The Nomos Publishing House offers the leading publishing program on questions of European research in [[Germany]].

In the field of [[jurisprudence]] dealing with network industries, communications and the respective European regulation legislation, ZEI Director Prof. Dr. Christian Koenig is Managing Editor of the journal series
* "Network Economics &amp; Law" ( "N &amp; R") with Law and Economics Publishing House (Frankfurt / Main) and co-editor of the journal
* "Communication &amp; Law" ("K &amp; R"), also published by Law and Economics Publishing House (Frankfurt / Main).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zei.uni-bonn.de/publications/journals-on-european-competition-law&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Graduate (Master) Education==
Since 1998, ZEI offers a one-year post-graduate Master program in English: 
The interdisciplinary “Master of European Studies - Governance and Regulation” features academics and practitioners from across Europe. They cover issues of politics, law and economics related to European integration. The Fellows of ZEI’s “Master of European Studies - Governance and Regulation” are post-graduate students with professional experience from across the EU and worldwide. Their career paths include public institutions, private sector, academia and the media and form a network of more than 500 alumni in over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zei.uni-bonn.de/education/alumni&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, ZEI regularly offers Summer Schools and Mid-Career Training Programs. Particularly noteworthy is the ZEI Academy in Comparative Regional Integration which accompanied ZEI's research on global comparative regional integration studies.

'''Comedy music''' is [[music]] that is [[Comedy|comic]] or [[humor]]ous in nature, encompassing a wide variety of [[music genre]]s. Popular types of comedy music include [[parody music]], [[novelty song]]s, [[comedy rock]] and [[comedy hip hop]]. Some comedians, such as [[Bo Burnham]] and [[Tim Hawkins]], use songs in stand-up in addition to more traditional joke-telling methods, while others, such as [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] and [[Lil Dicky]], focus entirely on comedy music as their sole medium of humor.

The software was written by Professor [[Nigel Howard (professor)|Nigel Howard]] for General [[Rupert Smith]] in 1996.]]
'''Confrontation analysis''' (also known as '''dilemma analysis''') is an [[operational analysis]] technique used to structure, understand and think through multi-party interactions such as negotiations. It is the underpinning mathematical basis of [[drama theory]]. 

It is derived from [[game theory]] but considers that instead of resolving the game, the players often redefine the game when interacting. Emotions triggered from the potential interaction play a large part in this redefinition. So whereas game theory looks on an interaction as a single decision matrix and resolves that, confrontation analysis looks on the interaction as a sequence of linked interactions, where the decision matrix changes under the influence of precisely defined emotional ''dilemmas''.&lt;ref name="dilemm"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=17 definition of Dilemma]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation and use==

Confrontation analysis was devised by Professor [[Nigel Howard (professor)|Nigel Howard]] in the early 1990s drawing from his work on game theory and [[metagame analysis]]. It has been turned to defence,&lt;ref name="dw1"&gt;See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/the-future-of-libya/4553627902 The future of Libya]&lt;/ref&gt; political, legal, financial&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;"role playing... can also be used by investors in the form of "confrontation analysis' such as that organised by former military analyst [[Michael Young (former military analyst)|Mike Young's]] [http://www.decisionworkshops.com Decision Workshops]" –  ''Greek Dungeons and German Dragons'', James Macintosh, ''[[Financial Times]]'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and commercial &lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/letting-agency/4550567082 Letting agency case study]&lt;/ref&gt; applications.

Much of the theoretical background to General [[Rupert Smith]]'s book ''[[The Utility of Force]]'' drew its inspiration from the theory of confrontation analysis.{{quotation|I am in debt to Professor Nigel Howard, whose explanation of Confrontation Analysis and Game Theory at a seminar in 1998 excited my interest. Our subsequent discussions helped me to order my thoughts and the lessons I had learned into a coherent structure with the result that, for the first time, I was able to understand my experiences within a theoretical model which allowed me to use them further|General Rupert Smith|[[The Utility of Force]] (p.xvi)}}

Confrontation analysis can also be used in a ''decision workshop'' as structure to support role-playing&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; for training, analysis and decision rehearsal.

== Method ==
[[Image:BosniaConfrontation0.JPG|thumb|361px|left|An interaction as a sequence of confrontations where the ''card table''&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; changes as the parties struggle to eliminate their ''dilemmas''&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt;]]
Confrontation analysis looks on an interaction as a sequence of confrontations. During each confrontation the parties communicate until they have made their ''positions''&lt;ref name="posn"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=29 definition of Position]&lt;/ref&gt; clear to one another.  These positions can be expressed as a ''card table'' (also known as an options board&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=29 definition of Options Board/Card table]&lt;/ref&gt;) of yes/no decisions. For each decision each party communicates what they would like to happen (their ''position''&lt;ref name="posn"/&gt;) and what will happen if they cannot agree (the ''threatened future''). These interactions produce ''dilemmas''&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt; and the ''card table'' changes as players attempt to eliminate these.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation1.JPG|thumb|x250px|right|Initial Card Table:&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The UN threatens to use air strikes, but is not believed by the Bosnian Serbs: The UN has three dilemmas&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt; The Bosnians have none]]
Consider the example on the [[:File:BosniaConfrontation2.JPG|right]] (Initial Card Table), taken from the [[Bosnian War#1995|1995 Bosnian Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;This example developed from that described in [[Rupert Smith|Smith R]], Tait A, Howard N (1999) [http://www.decisionmechanics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/warandpeace.pdf Confrontations in War and Peace]. ''Proceedings of the 6th international Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium'', U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, 19–20 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This represents an interaction between the Bosnian Serbs and the United Nations forces over the safe areas. The [[Bosnian Serbs]] had [[Bosniak]] enclaves surrounded and were threatening to attack.

Each side had a position as to what they wanted to happen:

The Bosnian Serbs wanted (see 4th column):
* To be able to attack the enclaves
* NOT to withdraw their heavy weapons from the enclaves
* For the UN NOT to use air strikes
The UN wanted (See 5th column):
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to attack the enclaves
* The Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to take hostages.
If no further changes were made then what the sides were saying would happen was (see 1st column):
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would attack the enclaves
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would NOT withdraw their heavy weapons
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would take hostages if the UN uses air strikes
*The UN said it would initiate air strikes.  However the Bosnian Serbs DID NOT BELIEVE them. (Hence the question mark on the Card Table).

Confrontation analysis then specifies a number of precisely defined ''dilemmas''&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt; that occur to the parties following from the structure of the card tables.  It states that motivated by the desire to eliminate these dilemmas, the parties involved will CHANGE THE CARD TABLE, to eliminate their problem.

In the situation at the start the Bosnian Serbs have no dilemmas, but the UN has four. It has three ''persuasion dilemmas''&lt;ref name="pd"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=32 definition of Persuasion Dilemma]&lt;/ref&gt; in that the Bosnian Serbs are not going to do the three things they want them to (not attack the enclaves, withdraw the heavy weapons and not take hostages). It also has a ''rejection dilemma''&lt;ref name="rd"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=40 definition of Rejection Dilemma]&lt;/ref&gt; in that the Bosnian Serbs do not believe they will actually use the air strikes, as they think the UN will submit to their position, for fear of having hostages taken.

Faced with these dilemmas, the UN modified the card table to eliminate its dilemmas.  It took two actions:

Firstly, it withdrew its forces from the positions where they were vulnerable to being taken hostage.  This action eliminated the Bosnian Serbs' option (card) of taking hostages.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation2.JPG|thumb|x250px|right|Second Card Table:&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The UN eliminated the Bosnian "hostage" card and brought in an additional, credible "Artillery" card, changing the situation in their favour: The Bosnian Serbs now have two ''persuasion dilemmas''&lt;ref name="pd"/&gt; and two ''rejection dilemmas''&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt;]]
Secondly, with the addition of the [[Rapid Reaction Force]], and in particular its artillery the UN had an additional capability to engage Bosnian Serb weapons; they added the card "Use artillery against Bosnian Serbs". Because of this, the UN's threat of air strikes became more credible.  The situation changed to that of the Second Card Table:

The Bosnian Serbs wanted (see 4th column):
* To be able to attack the enclaves
* NOT to withdraw heavy weapons from the enclaves
* For the UN NOT to use air strikes
* For the UN NOT to use artillery
The UN wanted (See 5th column):
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to attack the enclaves
* The Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons
If no further changes were made then what the sides were saying would happen was (see 1st column):
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would attack the enclaves, but the UN did not believe them.
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would NOT withdraw their heavy weapons, but the UN did not believe them.
*The UN said it would use artillery.  The Bosnian Serbs believed this.
*The UN said it would use air strikes.  This time, however, the Bosnian Serbs believed them.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation3.JPG|thumb|x250px|right|Final Card Table:&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The final situation. The Bosnian Serbs modified their position to eliminate their dilemmas. This involved accepting their initial goals as unobtainable]]
Faced with this new situation, the Bosnian Serbs modified their position to accept the UN proposal.  The final table was an agreement as shown in the Final Card table (see thumbnail and picture).

Confrontation analysis does not necessarily produce a win-win solution (although end states are more likely to remain stable if they do); however, the word ''confrontation'' should not necessarily imply that any negotiations should be carried out in an aggressive way.

The ''card tables'' or are isomorphic to [[game theory]] models, but are not built with the aim of finding a ''solution''. Instead, the aim is to find the dilemmas facing characters and so help to predict how they will change the table itself. Such prediction requires not only analysis of the model and its dilemmas, but also exploration of the reality outside the model; without this it is impossible to decide which ways of changing the model in order to eliminate dilemmas might be rationalized by the characters.

Sometimes analysis of the ticks and crosses can be supported by values showing the payoff to each of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/the-tables-in-a-decision-works/4557003218 understanding the tables used in confrontation analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
''Conservation behavior'' is aimed at applying an understanding of [[ethology|animal behavior]] to solve problems in the field of [[conservation biology]]. These are problems that may arise during conservation efforts such as [[captive breeding]], [[species reintroduction]], [[nature reserve|reserve connectivity]], and [[wildlife management]]. By using patterns in animal behavior, [[biologist]]s can be successful in these conservation efforts. This is done by understanding the proximate and ultimate causes of problems that arise. For example, understanding how proximate processes affect survival can help biologist train captive-reared animals to recognize predators post-release. Ultimate causes also have a clear benefit to conservation. For example, understanding social relationships that lead to [[fitness (biology)]] can help biologists manage [[wildlife]] that exhibit [[infanticide]]. Conservation projects may have a better chance of being successful if biologists search for a deeper understanding of how animals make [[adaptation|adaptive]] decisions.&lt;ref name=blum/&gt;

While animal behavior and conservation biology are conceptually intertwined, the idea of using animal behavior in conservation management was only first used explicitly in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Geist V, Walther F. (1974). The behavior of ungulates and its relation to management. Morges (Switzerland): IUCN. http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/NS-024-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, ''conservation behavior'' has slowly gained prominence with a surge of [[publication]]s in the field since the mid-1990s along with the [[Animal Behavior Society]] even forming a committee in support of ''conservation behavior''.&lt;ref&gt;Clemmons J.R.; Buchholz R. 1997.

==Applications==

===Wildlife conservation and management===
[[File:European honey bee extracts nectar.jpg|thumb|A [[Western honey bee|European honey bee]] forages for [[nectar]].]]
Understanding animal behavior can help limit the impact of humans on the environment. Wildlife conservation is concerned with protecting species and their habitats from the impact of human [[land development|development]]. [[Wildlife management]] is concerned with manipulating and exploiting wild species to achieve a desired end while ensuring their persistence and availability. Because management is often a component of conservation strategies, incorporating knowledge of animal behavior into wildlife management has potential for improving the outcomes of conservation projects.&lt;ref name=curio&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curio | first1 = E. | title = Conservation needs ethologv | doi = 10.1016/0169-5347(96)20046-1 | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 260–263 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of animal behavior can help managers design better [[wildlife reserve|wildlife]] and [[nature reserves]], reduce [[human–wildlife conflict]], understand and manage species’ responses to human-induced [[Stress (biology)|environmental stress]], and manage [[introduced species]].&lt;ref name=shumway&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shumway | first1 = C. A. | journal = Environmental Biology of Fishes | volume = 55 | pages = 183–201 | doi = 10.1023/A:1007562023150 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = |title=A Neglected Science: Applying Behavior to Aquatic Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildlife managers commonly try to create wildlife reserves to conserve [[habitat]] for [[species of concern]]. The behavior of target animals is pivotal in designing the size, shape, location, and habitat of these reserves. For example, many bird reserves in [[central america|Central]] and [[South America]] are located in high mountains, but in one instance 25% of the local birds left the protected area to [[foraging|forage]].&lt;ref&gt;Beissinger, S.R. 1997. Integrating behavior into conservation biology: potentials and limitations. pp. 23–47. In: J.R. Clem- mons &amp; R. Buchholz (ed.) Behavioral Approaches to Conservation in the Wild, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding behaviors including recruitment, settling, [[spawning]], foraging, [[territoriality]], daily movements, and seasonal patterns of [[Animal migration|migration]] are all important for conservation success.&lt;ref name=shumway/&gt;

Minimizing human–wildlife conflict is a persistent challenge in wildlife management and conservation. Behavioral manipulation can help mitigate some conflicts such as livestock depredation or agricultural destruction by repelling animals with [[strobe light]]s, sounds, aversive conditioning, or [[taste aversion]]. Not only are humans frequently coming into conflict with animals, but humans can also induce environmental stress on animals. Humans can begin to mitigate these stresses by understanding behaviors, such as the effect [[tourist]]s have on wildlife in reserves.

===Reducing the decline of species===
Because an animal's survival and [[reproduction|reproductive]] success relies on its behavior, knowledge of behavior is essential in actively reversing the decline of imperiled wild species.&lt;ref name=shumway/&gt; Knowledge of behavior can be used to reduce [[bycatch]] of fish species, reestablish breeding populations, or boost reproduction.&lt;ref name=curio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, C. 1993. Fish behaviour and fishing gear. pp. 609–643. In: T.J. Pitcher (ed.) Behaviour of Teleost Fishes, 2nd ed., Chapman &amp; Hall, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the behavior of fish has helped reduce bycatch by improving the selectivity of [[fishing tackle|fishing gear]]. Species can be separated by their initial response to a [[trawling|trawl mouth]], their position within a [[net (device)|net]], and their responses to visual and [[Rheotaxis|rheotactic]] [[sensory cue]]s.&lt;ref name=shumway/&gt; Use of behavioral characteristics such as these can help reduce tremendous waste that often occurs during [[fishing industry|industrial fishing]] and help manage for sustainable [[fishery|fisheries]].

The state of a declining species can sometimes be reversed by augmenting reproduction through behavior. By manipulating [[auditory system|auditory]], [[olfaction|olfactory]], and [[Visual perception|visual]] cues of animals, biologists can attract animals to breeding grounds or increase the number of breeding individuals. This method has been applied most successfully to bird populations.&lt;ref name=curio/&gt; For example, acoustic playbacks have attracted [[seabird]]s to historic and new breeding grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Baptista, L.F. &amp; S.L.L. Gaunt. 1997. Bioacoustics as a tool in conservation studies. pp. 212–242. In: J.R. Clemmons &amp; R. Buchholz (ed.) Behavioral Approaches to Conservation in the Wild, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, adding eggs to nests of some male fish species may promote increased spawning by females who prefer to spawn with males already possessing eggs.&lt;ref name=curio/&gt;

[[File:Murre colony.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[common guillemot|Common murre]]s on densely packed breeding grounds.]]

===Assessing biodiversity===
Knowing [[species richness]] and [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]] in a given area has been an important part of [[ecology]] since its creation. [[Census]]ing and monitoring methods can use animal behavior to assess and track the status of species of concern. Many times this involves using communication signals or other conspicuous behaviors to locate and count species. For example, knowledge of behavior can be used to locate birds by their [[mating]] calls, count [[mammal]]s who are more active during mating season, or track [[whale]] vocalizations and [[dolphin]] [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] signals.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, C.W., R. Charif, S. Mitchell &amp; J. Colby. 1996. Distribution and behavior of the bowhead whale, Balaena mysticetus, based on analysis of acoustic data collected during the 1993 spring migration off Point Barrow, Alaska.

[[Population viability analysis]] (PVA) can provide important information when assessing the status of a species and help evaluate conservation priorities. PVA is a process that can help determine the probability that a species will go [[extinct]] within a given number of years. Along with survival and reproduction, behavior can be factored into population viability models. These are behaviors that influence population [[demographics]] such as [[immigration]], [[emigration]], [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]], and [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name=reed&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Reed | first1 = J.

===Captive breeding and reintroduction===
Captive breeding and reintroductions of [[endangered species]] are becoming more common and necessary for the conservation of some species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tear | first1 = T.

Conservation Biology: An Evolutionary-Ecological Perspective, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland.&lt;/ref&gt; Many captive breeding and reintroductions have failed due to behavioral deficiencies of released animals because many times captive animals lack natural parental care or other environmental influences during critical learning periods.&lt;ref name=shumway/&gt; Animals need to learn a variety of behaviors that may be difficult to replicate in captive settings, including how to forage or catch prey, where it is safe to sleep, how to avoid predators, and intraspecies relationships and traditions.&lt;ref name=conway/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tudge, C. 1992. Last animals at the zoo: how mass extinction can be stopped. Island Press, Washington, D.C. 266 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Captive breeding programs often inadvertently alter behaviors of animals including interfering with normal patterns of mate selection, creating inappropriate social conditions, antipredator behavior, and conditioning them to humans. The loss or altercation of behaviors such as these can have devastating effects on released animals.

There has been some concern in the field of ''conservation behavior'' about the lack of official cohesion between behavior and conservation biology and the potentially avoidable mistakes that have been made in conservation.&lt;ref name=berger/&gt;&lt;ref name=shumway/&gt;&lt;ref name=caro1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Caro | first1 = T. | title = Behavior and conservation: A bridge too far? | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2007.06.003 | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 22 | issue = 8 | pages = 394–400| year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has even been argued that theoretical advances in behavior have made little practical contributions to conservation biology.&lt;ref name=caro1/&gt; While theory-driven behavior may have yet to become fully integrated into conservation, its importance is clear and application necessary.

== Discussion ==

Since its introduction in the late 1990s, peer-reviewed papers on the database have received thousands of citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mark Gerstein - Google Scholar Citations|url = https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YvjuUugAAAAJ|website = scholar.google.com|accessdate = 2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Werner G. Krebs - Google Scholar Citations|url = https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zVjmhJ8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en|website = scholar.google.com|accessdate = 2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database has been mentioned in news articles in major scientific journals,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bourne" /&gt; book chapters,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Users can search the database for a particular motion by either [[protein]] name or [[Protein Data Bank]] ID number.&lt;ref name=:1998&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerstein M, Krebs W |title=A database of macromolecular motions |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=26 |issue=18 |pages=4280–90 |date=September 1998 |pmid= 9722650|pmc=147832 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9722650 |doi=10.1093/nar/26.18.4280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, however, users will enter the database via the [[Protein Data Bank]], which often provides a hyperlink to the molmovdb entry for proteins found in both databases.

The database includes a web-based tool (the Morph server) which allows non-experts to animate and visualize certain types of protein [[conformational change]] through the generation of short movies. This system uses [[molecular modelling]] techniques to [[interpolate]] the structural changes between two different protein conformers and to generate a set of intermediate structures. A hyperlink pointing to the morph results is then emailed to the user.&lt;ref name="morph"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krebs WG, Gerstein M |title=SURVEY AND SUMMARY: The morph server: a standardized system for analyzing and visualizing macromolecular motions in a database framework |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=28 |issue=8 |pages=1665–75 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10734184 |pmc=102811 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10734184 |doi=10.1093/nar/28.8.1665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morph Server was originally primarily a research tool rather than general molecular animation tool, and thus offered only limited user control over rendering, animation parameters, color, and point of view, and the original methods sometimes required a fair amount of CPU time to completion.&lt;ref name=Maiti&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maiti R, Van Domselaar GH, Wishart DS |title=MovieMaker: a web server for rapid rendering of protein motions and interactions |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=33 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W358–62 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15980488 |pmc=1160245 |doi=10.1093/nar/gki485 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since their initial introduction in 1996, the database and associated morph server have undergone development to try to address some of these shortcomings&lt;ref name="updates"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16381870|pmc=1347409|title=The Database of Macromolecular Motions: new features added at the decade mark|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=34|issue=Database issue|pages=D296–301|year=2006|author1=Flores|first1=S|last2=Echols|first2=N|last3=Milburn|first3=D|last4=Hespenheide|first4=B|last5=Keating|first5=K|last6=Lu|first6=J|last7=Wells|first7=S|last8=Yu|first8=E.

'''Design and technology''' ('''D&amp;T''') is a school subject offered at all levels of primary and secondary school in England. It is used so children develop a range of designing skills and technology skills for example, using media to design their project and a saw to cut items. It first appeared as a titled subject in the first [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum of England, Wales and Northern Ireland]] in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/758394547|title=Debates in design and technology education|others=Owen-Jackson, Gwyneth, 1956-|isbn=9780415689045|location=London|oclc=758394547}}&lt;/ref&gt;. D&amp;T, or a similar form, has been taught in many countries around the world such as [[India]], United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Malta, China, South Africa, France and Finland &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/470685647|title=International handbook of research and development in technology education|date=2009|publisher=Sense Publishers|others=Jones, Alister., Vries, Marc J. de, 1958-, Buntting, Cathy M.|isbn=9789087908775|location=Rotterdam|oclc=470685647}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many international schools teach design and technology. As a school subject it involves students in designing in a practical context using a range or materials and media. It is also a university course in many countries, including Australia, Canada, the US, Singapore, South Africa, Netherlands and New Zealand, both for the preparation of teachers and for general education in areas such as [[industrial design]]. Some of the UK universities which deliver courses include: [[University of Brighton|Brighton]], [[Sheffield Hallam University|Sheffield Hallam]], [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths' College]] and [[Greenwich University|Greenwich]].

== Design and Technology qualifications ==

=== GCSE ===
With the first National Curriculum new [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE qualifications]] were introduced for D&amp;T in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Unlike the National Curriculum the previous subject titles were retained (e.g. [[craft, design and technology]] (CDT) and [[home economics]]) and others added (e.g. electronics, food technology, textiles technology and systems and control). These GCSE specifications had two assessed components:

* 40% of the final mark for  coursework
* 60% for an examination of general subject knowledge (materials, processes, techniques and sustainability etc.).

GCSE D&amp;T titles available included:

*GCSE Design and Technology: Electronic Products
*GCSE Design and Technology: Food Technology
*GCSE Design and Technology: Graphic Products
*GCSE Design and Technology: Resistant Materials
*GCSE Design and Technology: [[Systems and Control]]
*GCSE Design and Technology: Textiles Technology
*GCSE Design and Technology: Product Design

=== GCSE D&amp;T (2017 onwards) ===
Since September 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-design-and-technology|title=GCSE design and technology|last=|first=|date=4 November 2015|website=Gov.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new GCSE has been taught in England that incorporates all material areas (with the exception of food which is now a separate GCSE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-food-preparation-and-nutrition|title=GCSE Food preparation and nutrition|last=|first=|date=20 February 2015|website=Gov.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Similar to the previous GCSE, the new [[GCSE Specifications|specifications]] have two assessed components - an exam and a non-examined assessment (NEA) but with a 50:50 split of the marks. 

=== A level ===
[[Advanced Level (UK)|A and AS level]] examinations prepare students for individualised learning and problem solving, which is essential in business and industry. Time management is a key factor to candidates' success within the coursework elements of the qualification. The examinations are as rigorous as any other subject. Indeed, due to the complexity and variety of tasks and organisation skills required this examination and course is very demanding. The subject covers activities from [[Control engineering|control]] technology to aesthetic product design. Students have to use all types of computer software including [[computer-aided design]] and [[Computer-aided manufacturing|manufacture]], [[spreadsheet]]s and computer presentations.  Outputs from such work are often sent to [[CNC]] machines for manufacture.

== International Baccalaureate ==
IB Design Technology (DT) is an elective subject offered in many [[International Baccalaureate]] schools globally. Design is also offered in the [[IB Middle Years Programme]] as a compulsory subject for grades 6–10, and at the [[IB Diploma Programme|Diploma Programme]] level (grades 11-12). IB Design Technology is very similar in content to ''Design Technology'', which is widely offered in the national curricula of [[Education in England|England]], [[Education in Australia|Australia]], [[Education in Canada|Canada]], [[Education in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and many African nations. It is one of the [[IB Group 4 subjects|Group 4 sciences]].

The primary focus of MYP Design is to give students an understanding of the [[design cycle]], through a practical programme. The student will complete projects based on solving a real and authentic problem. Students document their progress as they follow the design cycle to come to a feasible solution. They create the solution and then evaluate it following thorough testing.

The Diploma Programme of Design Technology is a two-year introduction to designing, a range of fundamentals of technology, and global technological issues. It provides students with the knowledge to be able to design and make in school workshops, and also to develop an informed literacy about technology in general. Because it is an international curriculum it has a particular focus on global environmental issues. It covers core topics in human factors and ergonomics, resource management and sustainable production, modeling, raw materials to final production,  innovation and design, classic design. It covers advanced higher level topics in user centered design, sustainability, innovation and markets, and commercial production. The diploma is accepted for university entrance in many countries, and is a good preparation for careers in areas such as engineering, architecture, product design, interior design, design and education.

== Scotland ==
Technological education is part of the Scottish secondary school curriculum. Technological education is segregated into various subjects available at National 4, National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher

''Standard Subject in Technical''
*Graphic Communication
*Design and Manufacture
*Engineering Science
*Practical Electronics (available to N5 level)
*Practical Woodwork (available to N5 level)
*Practical Metalwork (available to N5 level)

''Specialist Subjects within Technical''
*Architectural technology
*Automotive engineering
*Civil engineering
*Building services
*Construction

== Awards ==
In the UK, the [[Arkwright Scholarships Trust]] awards two-year scholarships to students who are taking GCSE/Scottish Standard Grade in design &amp; technology. The Arkwright Engineering Scholarships support students through their A levels/Scottish Highers and encourage them to study engineering or a related area of design at a top university or through a high-quality industrial apprenticeship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14476">'''Developmental systems theory''' ('''DST''') is an overarching theoretical perspective on [[biological development]], [[heredity]], and [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="Cycles of Contingency"&gt;Oyama, S., Griffiths, P.E., and Gray, R.D. (2001). Cycles of Contingency: Developmental Systems and Evolution. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes the shared contributions of [[genes]], environment, and [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] factors on developmental processes. DST, unlike conventional scientific theories, is not directly used to help make predictions for testing experimental results; instead, it is seen as a collection of philosophical, psychological, and [[scientific modelling|scientific models]] of [[biological development|development]] and [[evolution]]. As a whole, these models argue the inadequacy of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] on the roles of genes and [[natural selection]] as the principle explanation of [[biological organization|living structures]]. Developmental systems theory embraces a large range of positions that expand biological explanations of organismal development and hold modern evolutionary theory as a misconception of the nature of living processes.

==Overview==
All versions of developmental systems theory espouse the view that:

* All [[biological process]]es (including both evolution and development) operate by continually assembling new structures.
* Each such [[structure]] transcends the structures from which it arose and has its own systematic characteristics, information, functions and laws.
* Conversely, each such structure is ultimately [[irreducible]] to any lower (or higher) level of structure, and can be described and explained only on its own terms.
* Furthermore, the major processes through which [[life]] as a whole operates, including [[evolution]], heredity and the development of particular organisms, can only be accounted for by incorporating many more layers of structure and process than the conventional concepts of ‘[[gene]]’ and ‘[[Natural environment|environment]]’ normally allow for.

In other words, although it does not claim that all structures are equal, development systems theory is fundamentally opposed to [[reductionism]] of all kinds. In short, developmental systems theory intends to formulate a perspective which does not presume the causal (or [[ontological]]) priority of any particular entity and thereby maintains an explanatory openness on all empirical fronts.&lt;ref&gt;Moss in Oyama et al. 2001: 90.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is vigorous resistance to the widespread assumptions that one can legitimately speak of genes ‘for’ specific [[phenotypic]] characters or that adaptation consists of evolution ‘shaping’ the more or less passive species, as opposed to adaptation consisting of organisms actively selecting, defining, shaping and often creating their niches.&lt;ref name="Lewontin 2000"&gt;Lewontin 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developmental systems theory: Topics ==

=== Six Themes of DST &lt;ref name="Cycles of Contingency" /&gt; ===

====     1. Joint Determination by Multiple Causes ====

::Development is a product of '''multiple interacting sources.'''

====     2. Context Sensitivity and Contingency ====

::Development depends on the '''current state''' of the organism.

====     3. Extended Inheritance ====

::An organism inherits '''resources from the environment''' in addition to ''genes.''

====     4. Development as a process of construction ====

::The organism helps shape its own environment, such as the way a beaver builds a dam to raise the water level to build a lodge.

====     5. Distributed Control ====

::Idea that '''no single source of influence has central control''' over an organism's development.

====     6. Evolution As Construction ====

::The evolution of an '''entire developmental system''', including whole ecosystems of which given organisms are parts, not just the changes of a particular being or population.

=== A computing metaphor ===
To adopt a computing metaphor, the reductionists whom developmental systems theory opposes assume that causal factors can be divided into ‘processes’ and ‘data’, as in the [[Harvard architecture|Harvard computer architecture]]. Data (inputs, resources, content, and so on) is required by all processes, and must often fall within certain limits if the process in question is to have its ‘normal’ outcome. However, the data alone is helpless to create this outcome, while the process may be ‘satisfied’ with a considerable range of alternative data. Developmental systems theory, by contrast, assumes that the process/data distinction is at best misleading and at worst completely false, and that while it may be helpful for very specific pragmatic or theoretical reasons to treat a structure now as a process and now as a datum, there is always a risk (to which reductionists routinely succumb) that this methodological convenience will be promoted into an ontological conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Oyama’s discussion of the use and misuse of norms of reaction in Oyama et al. 2001: 179-184.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, for the proponents of DST, either all structures are both process and data, depending on context, or even more radically, no structure is either.

=== Fundamental asymmetry ===
For reductionists there is a fundamental asymmetry between different causal factors, whereas for DST such asymmetries can only be justified by specific purposes, and argue that many of the (generally unspoken) purposes to which such (generally exaggerated) asymmetries have been put are scientifically illegitimate. Thus, for developmental systems theory, many of the most widely applied, asymmetric and entirely legitimate distinctions biologists draw (between, say, genetic factors that create potential and environmental factors that select outcomes or genetic factors of determination and environmental factors of realisation) obtain their legitimacy from the conceptual clarity and specificity with which they are applied, not from their having tapped a profound and irreducible ontological truth about biological causation.&lt;ref&gt;Oyama in Oyama et al. 2001: 177-184.&lt;/ref&gt; One problem might be solved by reversing the direction of causation correctly identified in another. This parity of treatment is especially important when comparing the evolutionary and developmental explanations for one and the same character of an organism.

=== DST approach ===
One upshot of this approach is that developmental systems theory also argues that what is inherited from generation to generation is a good deal more than simply genes (or even the other items, such as the fertilised zygote, that are also sometimes conceded). As a result, much of the conceptual framework that justifies ‘[[selfish gene theory|selfish gene]]’ models is regarded by developmental systems theory as not merely weak but actually false. Not only are major elements of the environment built and inherited as materially as any gene but active modifications to the environment by the organism (for example, a termite mound or a beaver’s dam) demonstrably become major environmental factors to which future adaptation is addressed. Thus, once termites have begun to build their monumental nests, it is the demands of living in those very nests to which future generations of termite must adapt.

This inheritance may take many forms and operate on many scales, with a multiplicity of systems of inheritance complementing the genes. From position and maternal effects on gene expression to epigenetic inheritance &lt;ref&gt;Jablonka and Lamb 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; to the active construction and intergenerational transmission of enduring niches,&lt;ref name="Lewontin 2000"/&gt; development systems theory argues that not only inheritance but evolution as a whole can be understood only by taking into account a far wider range of ‘reproducers’ or ‘inheritance systems’ – genetic, epigenetic, behavioural and symbolic &lt;ref&gt;Jablonka in Oyama et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; – than [[neo-Darwinism]]’s ‘atomic’ genes and gene-like ‘replicators’.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins 1976, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; DST regards every level of biological structure as susceptible to influence from all the structures by which they are surrounded, be it from above, below, or any other direction – a proposition that throws into question some of (popular and professional) biology’s most central and celebrated claims, not least the ‘central dogma’ of Mendelian genetics, any direct determination of phenotype by genotype, and the very notion that any aspect of biological (or psychological, or any other higher form) activity or experience is capable of direct or exhaustive genetic or evolutionary ‘explanation’.&lt;ref&gt;Oyama 1985; Oyama et al. 2001; Lewontin 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmental systems theory is plainly radically incompatible with both neo-Darwinism and information processing theory. Whereas neo-Darwinism defines evolution in terms of changes in gene distribution, the possibility that an evolutionarily significant change may arise and be sustained without any directly corresponding change in gene frequencies is an elementary assumption of developmental systems theory, just as neo-Darwinism’s ‘explanation’ of phenomena in terms of reproductive fitness is regarded as fundamentally shallow. Even the widespread mechanistic equation of ‘gene’ with a specific DNA sequence has been thrown into question,&lt;ref&gt;Neumann-Held 1999; Moss in Oyama et al. 2001: 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; as have the analogous interpretations of evolution and adaptation.&lt;ref name="Levins and Lewontin 1985"&gt;Levins and Lewontin 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the wholly generic, functional and anti-developmental models offered by information processing theory are comprehensively challenged by DST’s evidence that nothing is explained without an explicit structural and developmental analysis on the appropriate levels. As a result, what qualifies as ‘information’ depends wholly on the content and context out of which that information arises, within which it is translated and to which it is applied.&lt;ref&gt;See Oyama 2000 for a detailed critique of information processing theory from a developmental systems perspective)&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmental systems theory is by no means a narrowly defined collection of ideas, and the boundaries with neighbouring models are very porous. Notable related ideas (with key texts) include:

'''Divinity''' is the study of [[Christianity|Christian]] and other [[theology]] and [[Christian ministry|ministry]] at a [[school]], [[divinity school]], [[university]], or [[seminary]].  The term is sometimes a [[synonym]] for theology as an academic, speculative pursuit, and sometimes is used for the study of applied theology and ministry to make a distinction between that and academic theology. It most often refers to [[Christianity|Christian]] study which is linked with the [[professional degree]]s for [[ordination|ordained]] ministry or related work, though it is also used in an academic setting by other faith traditions.

==Areas and specializations==

Divinity can be divided into several distinct but related disciplines. These vary, sometimes widely, from church to church and from one faith tradition to another, and even among various programs within a particular church. A typical program will include many of the following:

===Philosophical theology===
* [[Systematic theology]]
* [[Dogmatic theology]]
* [[Moral theology]] or [[Christian ethics]]
* [[Natural theology]]
* [[Sacrament|Sacramental theology]]

===Practice of worship===
* [[Liturgics]]
* [[Homiletics]]
* [[Sacred music]]

===Ministry in the field===
* [[Pastoral theology]]
* [[Pastoral counseling]]
* [[Religious education]] techniques

===Scriptural study and languages===
{{See also|Sacred language}}
* [[Biblical studies]] or [[Sacred Scripture]]
* [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]]
* [[Koine Greek|New Testament Greek]]
* [[Latin]]
* [[Old Church Slavonic]]

===Miscellany===
* [[Canon law]]
* [[History of Christianity|Church history]]
* [[Ecclesiology]]

==Degrees ==

Studying divinity usually leads to the awarding of an [[academic degree]] or a [[professional degree]].  Such degrees, particularly in modern times the [[Master of Divinity]], are prerequisites for ordained ministry in most [[Christian denominations]] and many other faith communities. The exception to this is all "plain" churches such as the [[Amish]], [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], [[Old Order Mennonite]], [[Dunkard Brethren]], and many others. In fact, such churches hold to the belief that seminaries are an institution of man and not supported by Holy Scripture. Students earn such degrees at a free-standing [[seminary]], theologate or [[divinity school]], or at a university.

===List of degrees===

The real STS-75 mission occurred in 1996, 7 years after the text was published, and consisted of an all-male crew, clearly indicating that the document is a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roach |first1=Mary |title=Packing For Mars |date=2011 |publisher=W.

The '''East–West Center''' ('''EWC'''), or the '''Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West''', is an education and research organization established by the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1960 to strengthen relations and understanding among the peoples and nations of [[Asia]], the [[Pacific]], and the [[United States]]. It is headquartered in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]].

== History ==
[[File:Honolulu-EWC-JeffersonHall-wide.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Jefferson Hall Conference Center]]
[[File:Honolulu-EWC-Thaipavilion.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Thai Pavilion]]

The East–West Center originated as a [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] faculty initiative with a February 16, 1959, memo from professor [[Murray Turnbull]], then acting Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, to political science professor Norman Meller, then chairperson of the faculty senate, that proposed the creation of an International College of Cultural Affairs. However, [[University of Hawaii]] President [[Laurence H. Snyder]] stated that budgetary constraints prevented proceeding at the time with the idea.&lt;!--

Two months later, following radio reports of an April 16, 1959 speech in Washington, D.C. by then Sen. [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Texas|TX]]) that proposed the creation of an international university in Hawaii "as a meeting place for the intellectuals of the East and the West," history professor John Stalker and Meller urged President Snyder to respond at once to Johnson's suggestion.&lt;!--

  --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamins (1998), pp. 77–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 1959, Sen. Johnson introduced a bill in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] to establish an educational center in Hawaii to provide for "cultural and technical interchange between East and West," with a companion bill introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] by [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Delegate]] [[John A. Burns]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Territory of Hawaii|T.H.]]);&lt;!--

In 1977, John A. Burns Hall, located south of Hale Manoa on the {{convert|21|acre|m2|adj=on}} East–West Center campus, was completed. The four-story building for administrative offices was designed by architect John Hara to integrate with the style of the other East–West Center buildings (its windows mimic those of Lincoln Hall). It was built with State of Hawaii funds to compensate the federal government for the University's use of Edmondson Hall, the Kennedy Theatre, and the 4-story wing of Moore Hall, which had been built with federal funds for the East–West Center.&lt;!--

==Structure==
EWC program areas include Education, Research, Seminars, a [[Washington, D.C.]] office (which also houses and administers the United States Asia Pacific Council), an Office of External Affairs and the East–West Center Foundation.

===Research Program===
The Research Program conducts studies on economic development, trade, energy, governance, politics, security, conflict reduction, population, health, and environment. Under the Research umbrella is the Pacific Islands Development Program (the research and training arm and regional secretariat of the [[Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders]] representing 22 Pacific island nations).

===Education Program===
The Education Program offers educational opportunities for students and professional development seminars and workshops for educators from the U.S. and the region. The Student Program is carried out in partnership with the University of Hawaii and other universities in Hawaii and the continental U.S. scholarships are awarded annually in an international competition. Also under the Education Program are the [[Asia Pacific Leadership Program]] (APLP) (a certificate program for graduate-level students and mid-level professionals)[http://www.eastwestcenter.org/aplp/], AsiaPacificEd and the Asian Studies Development Program (both work with primary, secondary, and college educators to infuse Asian Pacific content in curricula), and Education 2020 (a focus on new approaches to educational challenges in the Asia Pacific Region). Most of education program participants reside in EWC dormitories like [[Hale Manoa Dormitory]].

===East–West Seminars===
East–West Seminars bring professionals from government, civil society, business and the media together for short-term dialogue and exchange programs to share knowledge and address issues of regional and global concern. Included in the Seminars Program are the Media Program (provides journalist with first-hand examination of issues in the region and the U.S.), Senior Policy Seminar (brings together top level foreign affairs and security officials, private sector and civil society leaders to discuss key regional issues), and the Asia Pacific Executive Forum (brings to American cities discussions on topics that affect the economics and business of the region). The East–West Center also organizes various women empowerment programs. It recently organized 2014 Changing Faces Women’s Leadership Seminar at Hawaii which saw the participation of 13 women entrepreneurs from the Asia Pacific Region.

===Office of External Affairs===
The Office of External Affairs (OEA) connects the resources and research of the EWC with the local, national, and international community through educational outreach, public programs, briefings, and media relations. Within the OEA is the News and Information office (provides EWC research findings, opinion pieces, and analysis of issues to journalists and the public), the Arts Program (presents performances and exhibitions illuminating the cultural values and art forms of national and ethnic traditions in the region), and the Alumni Office (works with an international network of professionals from more than 50 countries who have had a past affiliation with the EWC).

===East–West Center Foundation===
The East–West Center Foundation expands and enhances support for the EWC with private resources that support scholarships, research, and seminar initiatives not covered by core Congressional funding.

==Funding==
Approximately half of Center funding comes from the U.S. government, with additional support provided by private agencies, individuals, foundations, corporations, and the governments of the region. In 2005 the EWC received a total of $37 million (including $19.2 million from the U.S. Congress).

On May 7, 2009, President Barack Obama requested a reduction in federal funding for the EWC, from $21 million in fiscal year 2009 to $12 million for fiscal year 2010.&lt;ref name=wp20110421&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The outcome of the 2010 request was a $2 million increase in the Center's budget.&lt;ref name=wp20110421/&gt;  Subsequently in 2011, a request to reduce the budget by 50% (reduction by $10.7 million) was placed as part of the budget proposal.&lt;ref name=wp20110421/&gt;  The outcome of this request was a $2 million decrease in the Center's budget.&lt;ref name=wp20110421/&gt;

==Impact==
The impact of the EWC is far-reaching. More than 50,000 people have participated in EWC programs since 1960, including many who currently hold positions of leadership throughout the United States and the Asia Pacific. Alumni include heads of government, cabinet members, university and [[NGO]] presidents, corporate and media leaders, educators and individuals prominent in the arts.

==East–West Center Gallery==
The East–West Center Gallery presents changing exhibits of traditional and contemporary arts of the Pacific region.  The gallery is located on the campus of the University of Hawaii, and is open daily except Saturday.  Cultural performances are also presented.

== Hale Manoa Dormitory ==
[[File:Honolulu-EWC-HaleManoa-wide.JPG|thumb|Hale Manoa Dormitory]]

Hale Manoa is the East–West Center's student [[dormitory]].&lt;ref name="Place Names of Hawaii"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fkw4JooFxZAC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=Hale+Manoa+Dormitory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oW-Aid00G8&amp;sig=LooeaKiMeEVXPcSDs6nf3xxe07I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwksr1qoHKAhVCKGMKHUZFCkU4ChDoAQhHMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=Hale%20Manoa%20Dormitory&amp;f=false | title=Place Names of Hawaii - Hale Manoa | accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 13-story building, constructed in 1962, was designed by American architect [[I.&amp;nbsp;M. Pei]], and is located in the University of Hawaii, Honolulu.&lt;ref name="Hale Manoa Dormitory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/buildings/128714/hale-manoa-dormitory-honolulu-hi-usa | title=Hale Manoa Dormitory | publisher=Emporis is a global provider of building information | accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dormitory has a housing capacity of more than 400. This is a predominantly [[graduate student]] dormitory and most of the residents are mainly recipients of East West Center scholarships or are affiliated with their programs. Hence here there are [[EWC Graduate Degree Fellows]], [[Asia Pacific Leadership Program]] participants, [[EWC Affiliates]] and others who are not directly funded by the EWC. A large majority of the residents are international students from the Asia-Pacific region like China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Recently, there has been a move to bring in more students from [[South Asian]] countries.

It was an all-male dormitory, whereas a sister dormitory, [[Hale Kuahine]], situated just next to the [[Imin Center]] and also a [[I.&amp;nbsp;M. Pei]] building, housed all the females. Currently, Hale Manoa houses students of both genders.

The '''Economics Network''' is one of the subject networks originally established by the [[Higher Education Academy|Higher Education Academy (HEA)]]. On its founding it was known as the ''Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN) for Economics'' later becoming independent of the HEA. 

It has as its aims the improvement of learning and teaching in [[economics]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK's]] [[higher education]]. It lists its strategic aims as:
# Identifying, developing and disseminating evidence-informed approaches.
# Brokering and encouraging the sharing and implementation of effective practice and [[innovation]].
# Supporting individual staff, departments and institutions in initiating and responding to change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18746">'''EyesOn Design''' are a series of events including an annual [[car show]] and a [[fundraiser]] for the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology. It has become a national event focused on the emotion and character of [[automotive design]].

== History ==
The Eyes on Design Show was established on the late-1986 as both celebration of [[automotive design]] and a fundraiser for the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, a [[nonprofit organization]] in [[Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan]], devoted to matters pertaining to the [[Ophthalmology|eye and vision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eyeson.org/index.php/eyeson/as-history |title=The History of the EyesOn Design Car Show in June at the Edsel &amp; Eleanor Ford House in Grosse Pointe |first=Philip C. |last=Hessburg |publisher=Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130128132027/http://www.eyeson.org/index.php/eyeson/as-history |archivedate=28 January 2013 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.3ds.com/company/news-media/press-releases-detail/release/dassault-systemes-continues-tradition-of-sponsoring-eyeson/single/2492/?cHash=52d09b3ccc0fc59eaa396693b0dd4e7b |title=Dassault Systèmes Continues Tradition of Sponsoring EyesOn Design Competition |date=8 January 2008 |publisher=Dassault Systèmes |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first shows were called "Eyes On The Classics". The first shows were held in the [[Grosse Pointe Academy]] parking lots. Initially focused on the domestic "[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]" ([[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chrysler LLC|Chrysler]]), the show was expanded to include automakers from around the world. The name was also changed to "EyesOn Design". For its third show, the venue moved to the grounds of the [[Edsel and Eleanor Ford House]].

To ease access and accommodate the increasing public attendance, the design chiefs at DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and General Motors suggested that the event be hosted by one of their companies each year.&lt;ref name="beauregard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.cardesignnews.com/features/2002/020715eyesondesign/index.html |title=Eyes on Design 2002 - A weekend of classic design |first=Marc |last=Beauregard |date=15 July 2002| publisher=Car Design News |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 show was held at the [[Chrysler Headquarters and Technology Center]] in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The theme for this 15th anniversary weekend-long show was "Performance Vehicles".&lt;ref name="beauregard"/&gt;

In 2003, the [[General Motors Technical Center]] in Warren, Michigan hosted the event. According to [[General Motors]], the 2003 event was the largest, most complete collection of concept vehicles ever assembled representing the very best efforts of GM, Ford, Chrysler, and other automakers.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gmeurope.info/social_media_newsroom/news/2003/news_030603b.html |title=Design Automotive Exhibit at the GM Technical Center |publisher=General Motors |date=6 March 2003 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120311212908/http://www.gmeurope.info/social_media_newsroom/news/2003/news_030603b.html |archivedate=11 March 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-day event was also the first time the GM Design Center was open to the general public.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt; Attendees also had the opportunity to purchase rides in notable GM [[concept car]]s.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt;

A Founding Chairman of the annual EyesOn Design event, Chuck Jordan, was commemorated during the January 2011 [[North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardesignnews.com/site/home/rss_display/item214620/|title=2011 EyesOn Design Awards |first=Eric |last=Gallina |date=21 January 2011| publisher=Car Design News |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EyesOn Design show celebrated its 25th anniversary during summer 2012, on the grounds of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House with over 200 vehicles displayed by invitation only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.candgnews.com/news/eyeson-design-celebrates-25-years-visionary-vehicles |title=EyesOn Design celebrates 25 years of visionary vehicles |first=K. Michelle |last=Moran |publisher=C and G news |date=7 June 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design focus ==
The "Eyes on Design Show" has grown from an East Side show to an automobile exhibition of national and international significance.&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://apps.detnews.com/apps/joyrides/index.php?id=408 |last=Wright |first=Richard A. |title=From modest beginnings, Eyes on Design is now a major show| newspaper=The Detroit News |date=7 July 2003 |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120318005148/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/joyrides/index.php?id=408 |archivedate=18 March 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Ford Motor Company]], the Eyes on Design Show is the world's only car show to focus on the emotion and character of automotive design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=8089 |title= Honorary Chairman Announced for 2001 Eyes On Design |date=20 April 2001 |publisher= Ford Motor |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121007092232/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=8089 |archivedate=7 October 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing together some 250 concept cars in one place is the secret of the show's success that has been driven by the enthusiastic assistance of automotive design executives.&lt;ref name="wright"/&gt; In addition to vehicles from various automakers, the event also features concept cars by invitation from some of the world's most renowned vintage automobile collectors and restorers.&lt;ref name="gmpr03"/&gt;

The vehicles shown at the annual event are by invitation. Judging in numerous classes is "based not on the quality of the restoration or authenticity"; rather it is on the basis of their "the design character, emotional appeal and artistic excellence of the vehicle."&lt;ref name="beauregard"/&gt;

== Lifetime Design Achievement ==
The EyesOn Design celebrations include the prestigious "Lifetime Design Achievement" award. This recognition is given to an accomplished automotive designer selected by previous winners of this award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dbusiness.com/DBusiness/January-February-2010/EyesOn-Design-Celebrates-23-Years-with-the-Launch-of-its-2010-Season/ |title=EyesOn Design Celebrates 23 Years with the Launch of its 2010 Season |date=23 December 2009 |journal=dbusiness |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Courtyard of FPVMV.jpg|thumb|right|Courtyard of The Faculty of Political Science and International Relations, UMB]]
The faculty campus is located in the historical city downtown of [[Banská Bystrica]], bordering the branch office of the [[National Bank of Slovakia]] and the Matej Bel University Rector´s department. The campus consists of two buildings, which are set in a 4-acre urban park overlooking the river [[Hron]]. The main building is an early 17th-century [[chateau]], which was completely reconstructed in 1995 and 2010. The second building is an early 17th-century servant's house, which served for many years as a headquarters for the faculty's various student organizations. Partially reconstructed by the Euro-Atlantic Center, it had been the headquarters for the Slovak Atlantic Commission and the Centre of Nations, until 2011 when the newly established Slovak-French university institute moved into this object.

==Academics==
The faculty has had a distinctive international reputation since it was founded in 1995. The faculty's graduates have, on average, one of the largest salaries in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vs.iedu.sk/sk/profil/-/-/fakulta=f714060000 |title=Informácie o vysokých školách - Profil |publisher=Vs.iedu.sk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4104">[[Image:Hock.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Diagram showing the location of the hock.]]
The '''hock''', or '''gambrel''', is the joint between the [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal bones]] and [[tibia]] of a [[digitigrade]] or [[unguligrade]] [[quadrupedal]] mammal, such as a [[horse]], [[cat]], or [[dog]].   This joint may include articulations between tarsal bones and the [[fibula]] in some species (such as cats), while in others the fibula has been greatly reduced and is only found as a [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] remnant fused to the distal portion of the tibia (as in horses) {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}.  It is the anatomical [[Homology (biology)|homologue]] of the [[ankle]] of the human [[foot]].  While homologous joints occur in other [[tetrapod]]s, the term is generally restricted to mammals, particularly long-legged [[domestic animals|domesticated species]].

==Horse==
Although the ''tarsus'' refers specifically to the bones and joints of the hock, most people working with horses refer to the ''hock'' in such a way to include the bones, joints, and soft tissue of the area. The hock is especially important in [[equine anatomy]], due to the great strain it receives when the horse is worked. Jumping, and movements that require collection, are some of the more stressful activities.

===Primary joints and bones of the hock===
In the horse, the hock consists of multiple joints, namely:
*Tibiotarsal or tarsocrural joint
*Proximal intertarsal joint or talocalcanealcentroquartal joint
*Distal intertarsal joint or centrodistal joint
*Tarsometatarsal joint
*Talocalcaneal joint

In the horse, the hock consists of the following bones
*[[Talus bone|Talus]]
*[[Calcaneus]]
*Central [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal]] bone
*3rd tarsal bone
*3rd metatarsal bone
*4th tarsal bone
*Fused 1st and 2nd tarsal bone

===Equine disease states===
*Horses may suffer from  "capped hock", which is caused by the creation of a false [[bursa (anatomy)|bursa]], a [[synovial bursa|synovial]] sac beneath the skin. Capped hock is usually caused by [[Blunt trauma|trauma]] such as kicking or slipping when attempting to stand. In the absence of a wound, it does not require immediate veterinary attention and is usually only of cosmetic significance. On the other hand, a wound into the calcanean bursa is a serious problem. A capped hock is extremely unlikely to be a cause of [[lameness (equine)|lameness]], even if severe.
*[[Osteochondrosis dissecans]], or OCD is a developmental defect in the cartilage or of cartilage and bone seen in particular locations on the surface of the tarsocrural joint.  This condition is typically discovered when the horse is young, and is one cause of [[bog spavin]].  After surgery to remove bone and cartilage fragments most horses can return to full work.
*Distension of the tibiotarsal joint with excessive joint fluid and/or [[synovium]] is called [[bog spavin]].
*Degenerative joint disease of the tarsometatarsal or distal intertarsal joint is referred to as [[bone spavin]].
*[[Curb (horse)|Curb]], or tarsal plantar desmitis, is traditionally considered a sprain of the plantar ligament, which runs down the back of the hock, serving functionally as a tension band connecting the calcaneus, the fourth tarsal bone and the fourth metatatarsal bone.  Recent work has shown that curb can be caused by damage to one of many soft tissue structures in this region.
*[[Stringhalt]]

===Conformational defects===
''Also see [[equine conformation]]''

Because the hock takes a great deal of strain in all performance disciplines, correct [[equine conformation|conformation]] is essential if the horse is to have a sound and productive working life. Common conformational defects include [[sickle-hocked|sickle hocks]], [[post-legged]] conformation/straight hocks, [[cow-hocked|cow hocks]], and bowed hocks. Depending on the use of the horse, some defects may be more acceptable than others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10012">'''International relativistic astrophysics PhD program''', or '''IRAP PhD program''' is the international joint doctorate program in relativistic astrophysics initiated and co-sponsored by [[ICRANet]]. During 2010-2017 IRAP PhD takes part in the [[Erasmus Mundus|Erasmus Mundus program]] of the [[European Commission]]. For the first time in Europe the IRAP PhD program grants a joint PhD degree among the participating institutions.

== Education in relativistic astrophysics ==
In 2005 a new international organization was founded: the International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics Network ([[ICRANet]]), dedicated to the theoretical aspects of relativistic astrophysics. Together with the University of Arizona, the University of Stanford and the [[International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics|International Centre for Relativistic Astrophysics (ICRA)]], such states as Armenia, Brazil, Italy and the Vatican are the founding members of ICRANet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.icranet.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=618|title = ICRANet Members |website = ICRANet}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a first step, the international relativistic astrophysics Ph.D. program (IRAP Ph.D.) was established in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://icranet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=379&amp;Itemid=686|title = The 2005-2007 ICRANet Scientific Report|date = |access-date = |website = ICRANet|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the proponents of the IRAP Ph.D. program are [[Riccardo Giacconi]], [[Roy Kerr]] and [[Remo Ruffini]].

== The objectives of the program ==
The IRAP Ph.D. program grants a joint Ph.D. degree among the participating institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://irap-phd.eu/page4/page4.html|title = Objectives|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the program is the international consortium. It assembles expertise of its members for preparation of scientists in the field of relativistic astrophysics, and related fields of general relativity, cosmology and quantum field theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Artium mater in relativistic astrophysics : New perspectives for a European-Latin American PhD program|url = http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/proceeding/aipcp/10.1063/1.4937221|publisher = AIP Publishing|journal = AIP Conference Proceedings|date = 2015-12-17|pages = 070008|volume = 1693|doi = 10.1063/1.4937221|first = Pascal|last = Chardonnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the goals of the program is mobility: every student admitted to the IRAP Ph.D. is part of a team at one of the consortium members, and each year visits the other centers to keep track of developments in the other fields. Within the IRAP Ph.D. program, students are systematically trained in the techniques of research management and in the nature and organization of scientific projects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.uniroma1.it/didattica/dottorati/2015/astrofisica-relativistica-irap-phd-1|title = Uniroma1|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust''' is an [[industrial heritage]] organisation which runs ten [[museum]]s and manages 35 historic sites within the [[Ironbridge Gorge]] in [[Shropshire]], England, widely considered as the birthplace of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The Gorge includes a number of settlements important to industrial history and with heritage assets, including [[Ironbridge]], [[Coalport]] and [[Jackfield]] along the [[River Severn]], and also [[Coalbrookdale]] and [[Broseley]]. The area is a [[World Heritage Site]] (since 1986) and an anchor point of the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]] (ERIH).

==Museums==
The ten museum sites run by the Trust, collectively known as the '''Ironbridge Gorge Museums''' are:

# [[Blists Hill Victorian Town]], including the [[Hay Inclined Plane]]
# [[Broseley Pipeworks]]
# [[Coalbrookdale Museum of Iron]]
# [[Coalport China Museum]]
# [[Coalport Tar Tunnel]]
# [[Darby Houses]]
# [[Enginuity]]
# [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge and Tollhouse]]
# [[Jackfield Tile Museum]]
# [[Museum of the Gorge, Ironbridge|Museum of the Gorge]]

==The Trust==
Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust was established in 1968&lt;ref name="Trinder, 242" &gt;{{Cite book

It is an independent educational [[Charitable organization|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|503717|Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1970 it absorbed the Coalbrookdale Museum, now the Coalbrookdale Museum of Iron, which had been established in 1959.&lt;ref name="Trinder, 242" /&gt;

Its present CEO is Anna Brennand, who took over from Steve Miller in 2013. Previous CEOs have included [[Stuart Smith (archaeologist)|Stuart Smith]] and [[Sir Neil Cossons]], both well-respected experts on industrial history and archaeology.

The museum staff manage 35 historic sites within the Ironbridge Gorge World Heritage Site, including ten museums. The sites also include archaeological sites, two chapels, housing, two [[Quaker]] burial grounds, a research library, a tourist information centre, woodland, and two [[youth hostel]]s.

For over 20 years the museum has had a wide-ranging and innovative archaeology unit&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ironbridge.org.uk/our-story/sector-support/archaeology/ Ironbridge Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt; which originally undertook archaeological work within the Ironbridge Gorge and throughout the country, although it now concentrates its work within the Ironbridge Gorge. 



==Ironbridge Institute==
The Trust also runs the [[Ironbridge Institute]] in Coalbrookdale, a centre offering postgraduate and professional courses in heritage, in partnership with the [[University of Birmingham]].

'''''Law's Empire''''' is a 1986 text in legal philosophy by the late Oxford scholar [[Ronald Dworkin]] which continues his criticism of the philosophy of [[legal positivism]] as promoted by [[H.L.A. Hart]] during the middle to late 20th century. The book notably introduces Dworkin's Judge Hercules as an idealized version of a jurist with extraordinary legal skills who is able to challenge various predominating schools of legal interpretation and legal hermeneutics prominent throughout the 20th century. Judge Hercules is eventually challenged by Judge Hermes, another idealized version of a jurist who is affected by an affinity to respecting historical legal meaning arguments which do not affect Judge Hercules in the same manner. Judge Hermes' theory of legal interpretation is found by Dworkin in the end to be inferior to the approach of Judge Hercules.

==Background==
Much of the twentieth century in legal philosophy has been characterized by the confrontation of legal positivism with natural law theory as being among the most prominent legal theories seen in the century. One major proponent of the Anglo-American version of legal positivism was H.L.A. Hart, a professor at Oxford University, who was a teacher of Dworkin's and whom eventually Dworkin would come to strongly disagree with. To challenge the prevailing schools of legal interpretation and legal philosophy in the late twentieth century, Dworkin invented the personage of Judge Hercules to represent a version of legal philosophy which he saw as effectively answering many of the shortcoming he had come to identify with Hart and other legal schools prominent in his time.

Dworkin's approach in the book is to present his argument in ten chapters with one summary chapter added at the end of the book titled, "Law Beyond Law". The book is original in its format compared to conventional approaches to academic studies in the law by introducing the personage of Judge Hercules early in the text to answer many of the legal theories which Dworkin wishes to discuss as to their being insufficient to meet the requirements of late 20th century jurisprudence. In Dworkin's perspective, the prevailing climate of legal theory at the end of the 20th century was understood by him as being represented by the deficiencies of many competing and contradictory legal theories being presented by the legal academy. The ten chapters of the book build their logical argument sequentially and in growing complexity of exposition where each chapter is dependent upon the logical demonstrations made in previous chapters in order to establish the rationale and comprehension at work in the mind of the legal personage represented by Judge Hercules.

==Summary==
The Preface of the book is used by Dworkin to state his primary concern in this volume concerning his approach to the philosophy of law. Dworkin states concisely: "We are subjects of law's empire, liegemen to its methods and ideals, bound in spirit while we debate what we must therefore do." The "empire" of the law is expansive for Dworkin and includes not only the domain of jurisprudence but extends fully into the domain of politics and sociology, including the philosophical domain of morals, ethics and even aesthetics as these affect the lives of all individuals of society.

===Chapter One: What is Law?===
In this chapter, Dworkin tells his readers that there are three types of law with which he is primarily concerned. These three areas of law are outlined as (a) Conventionalism, (b) Pragmatism (semantic theory), and (c) Law as integrity. Dworkin shall make a primary point of defending Law as integrity throughout the subsequent chapters of his text.

===Chapter Two: Interpretive Concepts===
Dworkin introduced his principle of the 'semantic sting' of the semantic philosophy of law. He develops and distinguishes between two forms of skepticism to present his arguments differentiating between "internal skepticism" and "external skepticism", for use in subsequent chapters.

===Chapter Three: Jurisprudence Revisited===
Dworkin informs his readers that the concept of law is the theory of what forms the ground of law. The ground of law is the basis upon which the suppositions for the working and application of law are based and form an unavoidable basis for subsequent discussion of differing concepts of law. The phrase 'concept of law' was used by Hart as the title for an approach to law strongly oriented to Anglo-American reading of positive law to which Dworkin would take exception as to its insufficiency for dealing with issues of jurisprudence encountered throughout the 20th century.

===Chapter Four: Conventionalism===
In this chapter, Dworkin begins his three part, 3-tier assessment of law with his criticism of Conventionalism. He differentiated Conventionalism as falling into two different kinds, which are insufficient, in the end, to the needs of contemporary jurisprudence at the end of the 20th century leading to the start of the 21st century. Dworkin ends the chapter asserting the failure of Conventionalism.

===Chapter Five: Pragmatism and Personification===
Dworkin rejects pragmatism here as insufficient to the requirement of adjudication requirements and legislative principles which he sees as prevailing at the end of the twentieth century. Dworkin begins to stress that contemporary jurisprudence in his view needs to hold in high esteem the values of justice as integrity, fairness and due process.

===Chapter Six: Integrity===
For Dworkin, "Justice is a matter of outcomes: a political decision causes injustice, however fair its procedures that produced it, when it denies people some resource, liberty, or opportunity that the best theories of justice entitle them to have." For Dworkin, the answerability of jurisprudence to political theory and political obligations is central. Poliltical ideals are presented as operating from a base of moral concerns which do influence what is legislated as law.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin. ''Law's Empire''. Harvard University Press. 1987.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14524">In mathematical [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization theory]], the '''linear complementarity problem (LCP)''' arises frequently in [[computational mechanics]] and encompasses the well-known [[quadratic programming]] as a special case.  It was proposed by Cottle and [[George Dantzig|Dantzig]] {{nowrap|in&amp;nbsp;1968.&lt;ref name="Murty88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CPS92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Cottle and [[G. B. Dantzig]]. Complementary pivot theory of mathematical programming. ''Linear Algebra and its Applications'', 1:103-125, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Formulation ==
Given a real matrix ''M'' and vector ''q'', the linear complementarity problem LCP(''M'', ''q'') seeks vectors ''z'' and ''w'' which satisfy the following constraints:

* &lt;math&gt;w, z \geqslant 0,&lt;/math&gt; (that is, each component of these two vectors is non-negative)
* &lt;math&gt;z^Tw = 0&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently &lt;math&gt;\sum\nolimits_i w_i z_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt; This is the [[Complementarity theory|complementarity]] condition, since it implies that, for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, at most one of &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; can be positive.
* &lt;math&gt;w = Mz + q&lt;/math&gt;

A sufficient condition for existence and uniqueness of a solution to this problem is that ''M'' be [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]] [[Positive-definite matrix|positive-definite]]. If ''M'' is such that {{math|LCP(''M'', ''q'')}} have a solution for every ''q'', then ''M'' is a [[Q-matrix]]. If ''M'' is such that {{math|LCP(''M'', ''q'')}} have a unique solution for every ''q'', then ''M'' is a [[P-matrix]]. Both of these characterizations are sufficient and necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murty|first1=Katta G.|title=On the number of solutions to the complementarity problem and spanning properties of complementary cones|journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications|date=January 1972|volume=5|issue=1|pages=65–108|doi=10.1016/0024-3795(72)90019-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vector ''w'' is a [[slack variable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Convex Optimization of Power Systems|first=Joshua Adam|last=Taylor|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015| isbn=9781107076877|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBdoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and so is generally discarded after ''z'' is found. As such, the problem can also be formulated as:

* &lt;math&gt;Mz+q \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;z \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;z^{\mathrm{T}}(Mz+q) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (the complementarity condition)

==Convex quadratic-minimization: Minimum conditions==
Finding a solution to the linear complementarity problem is associated with minimizing the quadratic function

: &lt;math&gt;f(z) = z^T(Mz+q)&lt;/math&gt;

subject to the constraints

: &lt;math&gt;{Mz}+q \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;

These constraints ensure that ''f'' is always non-negative. The minimum of ''f'' is 0 at ''z'' if and only if ''z'' solves the linear complementarity problem.

If ''M'' is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]], any algorithm for solving (strictly) convex [[Quadratic programming|QPs]] can solve the LCP.  Specially designed basis-exchange pivoting algorithms, such as [[Lemke's algorithm]] and a variant of the [[simplex algorithm|simplex algorithm of Dantzig]] have been used for decades. Besides having polynomial time complexity, interior-point methods are also effective in practice.

Also, a quadratic-programming problem stated as minimize &lt;math&gt;f(x)=c^Tx+\tfrac{1}{2} x^T Qx&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;Ax \geqslant b&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;x \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt; with ''Q'' symmetric

is the same as solving the LCP with

:&lt;math&gt;q = \begin{bmatrix} c \\ -b \end{bmatrix}, \qquad M = \begin{bmatrix} Q &amp; -A^T \\ A &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This is because the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker]] conditions of the QP problem can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} 
v = Q x - A^T {\lambda} + c \\ 
s = A x - b \\ 
x, {\lambda}, v, s \geqslant 0 \\ 
x^{T} v+ {\lambda}^T s = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''v'' the Lagrange multipliers on the non-negativity constraints, ''λ'' the &lt;!-- Lagrange  --&gt;multipliers on the inequality constraints, and ''s'' the slack variables for the inequality constraints. The fourth condition derives from the complementarity of each group of variables {{math|(''x'', ''s'')}} with its set of KKT vectors (optimal Lagrange multipliers) being {{math|(''v'', ''λ'')}}. In that case,

: &lt;math&gt;z = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ \lambda \end{bmatrix}, \qquad w = \begin{bmatrix} v \\ s \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the non-negativity constraint on the ''x'' is relaxed, the dimensionality of the LCP problem can be reduced to the number of the inequalities, as long as ''Q'' is non-singular (which is guaranteed if it is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]]). The multipliers ''v'' are no longer present, and the first KKT conditions can be rewritten as:

: &lt;math&gt;Q x = A^{T} {\lambda} - c&lt;/math&gt;

or:

: &lt;math&gt; x = Q^{-1}(A^{T} {\lambda} - c)&lt;/math&gt;

pre-multiplying the two sides by ''A'' and subtracting ''b'' we obtain:

: &lt;math&gt; A x - b = A Q^{-1}(A^{T} {\lambda} - c) -b \,&lt;/math&gt;

The left side, due to the second KKT condition, is ''s''. Substituting and reordering:

: &lt;math&gt; s = (A Q^{-1} A^{T}) {\lambda} + (- A Q^{-1} c - b )\,&lt;/math&gt;

Calling now

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
M &amp;:= (A Q^{-1} A^{T}) \\
Q &amp;:=  (- A Q^{-1} c - b)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

we have an LCP, due to the relation of complementarity between the slack variables ''s'' and their Lagrange multipliers ''λ''. Once we solve it, we may obtain the value of ''x'' from ''λ''  through the first KKT condition.

Finally, it is also possible to handle additional equality constraints:

: &lt;math&gt;A_{eq}x = b_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;

This introduces a vector of Lagrange multipliers ''μ'', with the same dimension as &lt;math&gt;b_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is easy to verify that the ''M'' and ''Q'' for the LCP system &lt;math&gt; s = M {\lambda} + Q&lt;/math&gt; are now expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
M &amp;:= \begin{bmatrix} A &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} Q &amp; A_{eq}^{T} \\ -A_{eq} &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{-1}  \begin{bmatrix} A^T \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}  \\
Q &amp;:= - \begin{bmatrix} A &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} Q &amp; A_{eq}^{T} \\ -A_{eq} &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} c \\ b_{eq} \end{bmatrix} - b
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

From ''λ'' we can now recover the values of both ''x'' and the Lagrange multiplier of equalities ''μ'':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} x \\ \mu \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} Q &amp; A_{eq}^{T} \\ -A_{eq} &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} A^T \lambda - c \\ -b_{eq} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, most QP solvers work on the LCP formulation, including the [[interior point method]], principal / complementarity pivoting, and [[active set]] methods.&lt;ref name="Murty88"&gt;{{harvtxt|Murty|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CPS92"&gt;{{harvtxt|Cottle|Pang|Stone|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; LCP problems can be solved also by the [[criss-cross algorithm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fukuda|Namiki|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fukuda|Terlaky|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRT"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=D. |last1=den&amp;nbsp;Hertog |first2=C.| last2=Roos |first3=T. |last3=Terlaky|title=The linear complementarity problem, sufficient matrices, and the criss-cross method|journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications|volume=187|date=1 July 1993|pages=1–14|url=http://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6714737.pdf|doi=10.1016/0024-3795(93)90124-7|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CIsufficient"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Zsolt |last1=Csizmadia |first2=Tibor |last2=Illés|title=New criss-cross type algorithms for linear complementarity problems with sufficient matrices|journal=Optimization Methods and Software| volume=21 |year=2006 |number=2 |pages=247–266|doi=10.1080/10556780500095009|url=http://www.cs.elte.hu/opres/orr/download/ORR03_1.pdf|format=pdf|&lt;!-- ref=harv --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; conversely, for linear complementarity problems, the criss-cross algorithm terminates finitely only if the matrix is a sufficient matrix.&lt;ref name="HRT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIsufficient"/&gt; A [[sufficient&amp;nbsp;matrix]] is a generalization both of a [[positive-definite matrix]] and of a [[P-matrix]], whose [[principal&amp;nbsp;minor]]s are each positive.&lt;ref name="HRT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIsufficient"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Cottle | first1=R.&amp;nbsp;W. |authorlink1=Richard W.

'''The March of Remembrance and Hope''' (MRH) is a program designed for university and college students of all religions and backgrounds. The program takes place in mid-May, and includes a two-day trip to Germany, followed by a five-day visit to Poland. The international MRH program was founded in 2001 by Dr. David Machlis of the United States and Eli Rubenstein of Canada, both of whom were involved in the [[March of the Living]] program.

During the trip students visit locations in Germany and Poland related to the [[Holocaust]] and other World War II genocides, including the site of the [[Wannsee Conference]], and the former concentration/death camps of  [[Auschwitz]],  [[Treblinka]] and [[Majdanek]].

The purpose of the March of Remembrance and Hope is to teach students of various religious and ethnic backgrounds about the dangers of intolerance through the study of the Holocaust and other World War II genocides, and to promote better relations among people of diverse cultures.

Holocaust survivors also participate in the March of Remembrance and Hope program, sharing their painful memories in the very places in which their stories transpired. During the trip, the students also meet one of the [[Righteous Among the Nations]], and learn of the heroic actions a minority of Europe's population took to resist Nazi tyranny.

Since its inception, students of many diverse religions, backgrounds and ethnicities have taken part in the March of Remembrance and Hope program, including: Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Seventh Day Adventist, and many others. In addition, students who come from their own history of persecution (such as survivors of the [[Rwandan Genocide]], [[First Nation]] students, African Americans, etc.) have also participated in the March of Remembrance and Hope.

From 2007 to 2011 the program was run annually in Canada for Canadian university students, by the
[[Canadian Centre for Diversity]], with the cooperation of other organizations. In 2013, CCD transferred the program over to [[March of the Living]] Canada. The major funder of the Canadian program is the Azrieli Foundation, founded by Canadian Holocaust survivor, [[David Azrieli]], which is a Canadian philanthropic organization that supports a wide range of initiatives and programs, among which include Holocaust commemoration and education.

The international MRH program is currently on hold, but there are American groups who have traveled with the Canadian delegation, namely [[Nazareth College (New York)|Nazareth College]] and [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]].  There is also an [http://www.morah.at/ Austrian program] by the same name for university students of diverse backgrounds that travels to Poland earlier during the year,  during the [[March of the Living]] (MOL). In 2010,  [[Nazareth College (New York)|Nazareth College]] and [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]] launched their own program called The March: Bearing Witness to Hope - http://morah.naz.edu/.

(While there are similarities,  MRH and MOL are two different programs. MRH is primarily aimed at university students of diverse backgrounds,  does not include a trip to Israel, and its goals are of a universal nature.  MOL is primarily aimed at Jewish high school students, and in addition to universal goals, also includes goals related to Jewish identity and connection to Israel, and usually includes a week long trip to Israel following the Poland portion of the trip.)

Two student organizations in Canada dedicated to teaching tolerance and combating genocide, "’[http://www.shoutcanada.ca Shout Canada] "’ and  "’[https://web.archive.org/web/20080918004057/http://www.standcanada.org/pages/home.html Stand Canada] "’, were founded by students who participated in Marches to Poland. Many of the student leaders and active members of these two organizations are alumni of the March of Remembrance and Hope program.

==Goals of the March of Remembrance and Hope Program==
# To never again allow for the unchecked rise of the menace of anti-Semitism or any kind of racial discrimination directed by any individual or group in society against another to gain strength. Included in this goal is the teaching that all human beings are equal, precious and valued, and the diminution of the dignity of any member of the human family is a cardinal violation of all ethical teachings.
# To recognize and learn from the altruistic actions of the "righteous among the nations", who teach us to never be a bystander in the face of oppression.
# To remember those who perished, to be a witness, thus denying Hitler a "posthumous victory". The role of the survivor is a key element in this goal.
# To pay tribute to the courage of those who survived the Holocaust, who rebuilt their lives despite the haunting memories of the past.
# To honor the heroic veterans of World War II who fought to liberate Europe from the hands of Nazi tyranny.
# To welcome opportunities to learn about participants' different ethnicities and beliefs so that we may transcend our religious, political, and cultural boundaries in order to bear witness to the common humanity we all share.
# To inspire participants to commit to building a world free of oppression and intolerance, a world of freedom, democracy and justice, for all members of the human family. Related to this goal is to teach the message that, when participants return to their communities, each of them has the ability to make a real and lasting difference in the world.
# The final goal is not so much to learn from or about history, but to enter into history. By visiting Germany and Poland, students are taking part in a commemorative act that declares that the memory of six million Jews and millions of other innocent victims -  Poles, Roma and Sinti, Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, the disabled and political prisoners -  who were murdered during the Holocaust and World War II, has been marked and will never be forgotten.

&lt;!-- no separate rationale for this article [[Image:Minerva logo.gif|right|frame]] --&gt;
The '''Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics''' ('''MPA''') is a research institute located in [[Garching bei München|Garching]], just north of [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It is one of many [[scientific research]] institutes belonging to the Max Planck Society.

The MPA is widely considered to be one of the leading institutions in the world for [[theoretical astrophysics]] research.
According to [[Thomson Reuters]], from 1999-2009 the Max Planck Society as a whole published more papers and accumulated more citations in the fields of [[physics]] and [[space science]] than any other research organization in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencewatch.com/inter/ins/09/09Top20Overall/], Thomson Reuters Science Watch.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Max Planck Society]] was founded on 26 February 1948. It effectively replaced the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] for the Advancement of Science, which was dissolved after [[World War II]]. The society is named after [[Max Planck]], one of the founders of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].

The MPA was founded as [[Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics]] in 1958 and split into the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]] in 1991. In 1995, the numerical relativity group moved to the [[Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics]].

==Organization==
The MPA is one of several Max Planck Institutes that specialize in [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]]. Others are the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]] in Garching (located next-door to the MPA), the [[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy]] in Heidelberg, the [[Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy]] in Bonn, the [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] in Göttingen, and the [[Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics]] (a.k.a. Albert Einstein Institute) in Golm.

The institute is located next-door to the MPI for Extraterrestrial Physics, as well as the headquarters of the [[European Southern Observatory]]. It also enjoys close working relationships with the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] and [[Technical University Munich]].

At any given time, the institute employs approximately 50 scientists, instructs over 30 PhD students, and hosts about 20 visiting scientists (some 60 visitors stay for longer than 2 weeks in any given year).

As of 2018, the four directors of the MPA are [[Guinevere Kauffmann]], [[Eiichiro Komatsu]], [[Volker Springel]], and [[Simon White]].

==Science==
Focusing on theoretical investigations, the MPA covers a wide range of topics in [[astrophysics]]. These include:
* '''[[Physical cosmology|Cosmology]]''', in particular [[galaxy formation and evolution]], [[reionization]], and the [[cosmic microwave background]];
* '''[[High-energy astronomy]] and astrophysics''', including [[supermassive black holes]], [[galaxy clusters]], [[active galactic nuclei]] and [[quasars]], [[X-ray binaries]], and [[accretion disc]]s;
* '''[[Stellar physics]]''', including [[stellar evolution]] and stellar explosions such as [[supernovae]] and [[gamma-ray bursts]].

==Public outreach==
The MPA works to explain astrophysical concepts and disseminate its findings to the public. These activities include popular science articles written by MPA scientists, events hosting school groups, events open to the general public, and monthly research highlights written for a general audience.

==Graduate program==
The International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Astrophysics is a graduate program offering a PhD in [[astrophysics]]. The school is a cooperation with the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]] and [[Technical University Munich]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6108">In biology or medicine, a '''multi-access key''' is an [[identification key]] which overcomes the problem of the more traditional [[single-access key]]s ([[dichotomous key|dichotomous]] or [[polytomous key|polytomous identification keys]]) of requiring a fixed sequence of identification steps. A multi-access key enables the user to freely choose the characteristics that are convenient to evaluate for the item to be identified.&lt;ref name=Pankhurst&gt;Pankhurst, R. J. 1991. Practical Taxonomic Computing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Winston, J. 1999. Describing Species. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|9780231068253}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although good single-access keys will try to start with characters that are reliable, convenient to observe and generally available throughout most of the year, it is often impossible to achieve this for all taxa in a key. A multi-access key lets the user adapt the key to the particular organism that is being identified and to the circumstances of identification (e.g. field or laboratory).

Multi-access keys may be printed in various way (tabular, matrix, formula style, etc.) but are more commonly used as computer-aided, interactive keys.

==Alternative terms==

Alternative terms used for multi-access keys are "random-access key", "multi-entry key", [[polyclave]], "matrix key", "tabular key", "synoptic key". Some of these terms should be avoided in this sense, however:

* "Multi-entry" keys allow the free choice of characters only in the first step, whereas in a typical multi-access key the choice of characters used for identification can be repeated multiple times (reducing the number of remaining taxa each time). The single step of selecting one or multiple criteria is followed by a dichotomous key for the species remaining after this step. 
* The terms "tabular key" and "matrix key" are best limited to a tabular presentation format of multi-access keys.&lt;ref&gt;Fig. 19.6 in Winston, J. 1999. Describing Species. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The term "synoptic key" has an older definition, defining it as a key reflecting taxonomic classification and opposed to diagnostic keys arranged solely for the convenience of identification.&lt;ref name=Pankhurst/&gt;

==History==

Interactive multi-access keys are a high-tech descendent of polyclaves ("card keys"). Historically various styles of encoding features of species (such as flower color) on punch cards were used. Holes or notches in these cards would allow the user to choose cards based on characters observed in a specimen until only one card remained, yielding a tentative identification.&lt;ref name=Pankhurst/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

== Advantages ==

Multi-access keys largely serve the same purpose as single-access (dichotomous or polytomous) keys, but have many advantages, especially in the form of computer-aided, interactive keys.&lt;ref&gt;Dallwitz, M.J., Paine, T.A. and Zurcher, E.J. 2000 onwards. [http://delta-intkey.com/www/interactivekeys.htm Principles of interactive keys].&lt;/ref&gt;  The user of an interactive key may select or enter information about an unidentified specimen in any order, allowing the computer to interactively rule out possible identifications of the entity and present the user with additional helpful information and guidance on what information to enter next.  Full-featured interactive keys may readily be equipped with images, audio, video, supplemental text, much-simplified language in conjunction with technical language and hyperlinks to assist the user with understanding of both entities and features.&lt;ref name=brasher&gt;Brasher, J. W. 2006. [http://worldcat.org/oclc/122551481?tab=details The Southern Rocky Mountain Interactive Flora (SRMIF) and factors correlated with recognition of plants and mammals. University of Northern Colorado, Ph. D. Thesis.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive keys remedy some of the problems outlined above.  The problem of language translations is made easier in interactive keys because characters and states frequently are simplified with less reliance on the intricate nuances of long strings of words.  The problem above where only one sex of an unknown specimen is at hand is mitigated because the user can simply use other characters.  The problem of not having a reliable and complete description to compare a specimen with is alleviated by full service interactive keys that include or link to such descriptions and authoritatively identified images.  The problem above about complete descriptions not being available in the field is also remedied if the interactive key is on a laptop or handheld computer.  With paper-based dichotomous keys the discovery of a new species renders the key incomplete; interactive keys are easily updated by adding information for newly discovered species and reposting computer files on the internet.&lt;ref name=brasher/&gt;

Many different computer programs for interactive keys are currently available, some of which are truly multi-access, and some not.&lt;ref&gt;Dallwitz, M.J. 1996 onwards. [http://delta-intkey.com/www/idprogs.htm Programs for interactive identification and information retrieval].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dallwitz, M.J. 2000 onwards. [http://delta-intkey.com/www/comparison.htm A comparison of interactive identification programs].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ostforschung''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔɔstˌfɔʁʃʊŋ|lang}}, "research on the east") is a [[German language|German]] term dating from the 18th century for the study of the areas to the east of [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|the core German-speaking region]].

Traditional ''Ostforschung'' has fallen into disrepute with modern German historians as it often reflected Western European [[Anti-Polish sentiment|prejudices of the time]] towards [[Poles]].&lt;ref name=Karin&gt;{{cite book |first=Karin |last=Friedrich |date=2006 |title=The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569-1772 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=5, 13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpulHjDt8UEC&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''Ostforschung'' itself remained in use in the names of some journals and institutes throughout the [[Cold War]], but was replaced by more specific terms by the 1990s (e.g., the journal ''Zeitschrift für Ostforschung'', established in 1952, was renamed ''[[Zeitschrift für Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung]]'' in 1994).

Since the 1990s, ''Ostforschung'' itself has become a subject of historical research.

''Ostforschung'' was also the name of a multidisciplinary organization set up before [[World War II]] by Nazi German chief propagandist [[Albert Brackmann]] supporting Nazi genocidal policies, ethnic cleansing and anti-semitism. Brackmann and several other Nazi and nationalist historians and anthropologists co-ordinated Nazi German research on [[Eastern Europe]], mainly the [[Second Polish Republic]]. The research conducted by this organisation, as well as the [[Ahnenerbe]], was instrumental in planning of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] of local non-German populations in [[Generalplan Ost]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26052">'''Peace economics''' is a specialized branch of [[economics]].  Peace economics focuses on the design of the sociosphere's political, economic, and cultural institutions and their interacting policies and actions with the goal of preventing, mitigating, or resolving violent conflict within and between societies.  This violent conflict could be of any type and could involve either latent or actual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Brauer, Jurgen and Raul Caruso. (2012). "Economists and Peacebuilding." In Roger MacGintry (ed.), Handbook on Peacebuilding. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Presuming knowledge of the cost of violence, it focuses on the benefits of (re)constructing societies&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, John M. (1920). The Economic Consequences of the Peace. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, Kenneth E. (1945). The Economics of Peace. New York: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Del Castillo, Graciana. (2008). Rebuilding War-Torn States: The Challenge of Post-Conflict Economic Reconstruction. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brauer, Jurgen and J. Paul Dunne. (2012). Peace Economics: A Macroeconomic Primer for Violence-Afflicted States. Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with a view toward achieving irreversible, stable [[peace]].&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, Kenneth E. (1978). Stable Peace. Austin, TX: The University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with approaches drawn from disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, psychology and cognitive science, geography and regional science, and political science and international relations, peace economics forms part of peace science, an evolving part of [[peace and conflict studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. (1992). Understanding Conflict and the Science of Peace. Cambridge, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace economics is distinct from both war economics and military economics, even though there may be substantial overlap between these disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Poast, Paul. (2006). The Economics of War. New York: McGraw-Hill Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, Keith and Todd Sandler, eds. (1995). Handbook of Defense Economics. Vol. 1. Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Todd and Keith Hartley. (1995). The Economics of Defense. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ron P. (2009). Military Economics: The Interaction of Power and Money. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;  Peace economics is also distinct from [[conflict economics]],&lt;ref&gt;Hirshleifer, Jack. (2001). The Dark Side of the Force: Economic Foundations of Conflict Theory. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderton, Charles H. and John R. Carter. (2009). Principles of Conflict Economics: A Primer for Social Scientists. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is distinct from security economics.&lt;ref&gt;Brück, Tilman. (2005). "An Economic Analysis of Security Policies." Defense and Peace Economics. Vol. 16, No. 5, pp. 375-389.&lt;/ref&gt; A key difference between peace economics and these related fields is that peace economics emphasizes a study of the presence of peace, as distinct from studying the absence or presence of conflict, violence, war, or insecurity.

==Other definitions==

Peace economics has also been defined as "the use of economics to understand the causes and effects of violent conflict in the international system and the ways that conflict can be avoided, managed, or resolved."&lt;ref&gt;Anderton, Charles H. and John R. Carter. (2007). "A Survey of Peace Economics," pp. 1211-1258 in Todd Sandler and Keith Hartley, eds., Handbook of Defense Economics. Vol. 2. Amsterdam: Elsevier. The quote is from p. 1212.&lt;/ref&gt; This restricts the subject matter to the international realm and leaves out the study of peace itself. [[Walter Isard]] defines peace economics as "generally concerned with: (1) resolution, management or reduction of conflict in the economic sphere, or among behaving units in their economic activity; (2) the use of economic measures and policy to cope with and control conflicts whether economic or not; and (3) the impact of conflict on the economic behavior and welfare of firms, consumers organizations, government and society."&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. (1994). "Peace Economics: A Topical Perspective." Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 11-13. The quote is from p. 11. [A slightly revised reprint of Walter Isard, "Peace Economics" in Douglas Greenwald, Editor in Chief, The McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Economics. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1994, pp. 767-769.]&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of violence is absent and peace itself is not studied, but the level of analysis can be other than conflict between states. In a context restricted to international trade, another author writes that "Peace economics studies ways to eradicate and control conflict as well as to assess conflict's impact on society."&lt;ref&gt;Polachek, Solomon W. (1994). "Peace Economics: A Trade Theory Perspective." Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 2, pp.14-17. The quote is from p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of violence is not explicit and the benefits of peace are seen only inasmuch as a reduction of conflict may improve opportunities for expanded global trade. Others make a distinction between "productive" and "unproductive" or "appropriative" economic activities their starting point of analysis in peace economics.&lt;ref&gt;Haavelmo, Trygve. (1954).

Economics Nobelist [[Jan Tinbergen]] defines peace economics as "economic science used for [a purpose that] prohibits [war] as an instrument of settling conflicts between nations and [to organize] the world in a way that warfare is punished".&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen Jan. (1994). "What is Peace Economics?" Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 4, pp. 3-5. The quote is from p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence is addressed only at the level of sovereigns, not dealing with civil war or debilitating organized or individual-level criminal violence. In related work, Tinbergen writes about a [[International relations|world order]] that would inhibit violence and permit peace between and among states. In his view, this requires a "world government",&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen Jan. (1994). "What is Peace Economics?" Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 4, pp. 3-5. The quote is from p. 3 as well.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Tinbergen, Jan and Dietrich Fischer (1987). Warfare and Welfare: Integrating Security Policy into Socio-Economic Policy. New York: St. Martin's Press, and Tinbergen Jan. (1990). World Security and Equity. Aldershot, UK: Elgar.&lt;/ref&gt; a sentiment not now commonly agreed among economists. These definitions of peace economics all share [[Johan Galtung]]'s characterization of negative peace (the absence of violent conflict) as opposed to positive peace (the presence of peace-enabling structures).

==Methods, norms, and context==

A number of peace economists are explicit about the use of particular explanatory schema to be applied in peace economics, e.g., [[rational choice theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Dacey, Ray. (1994). "Peace Economics as the Political Economy of Peace and War." Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy. Vol. 2, No. 1, pp.8-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the main definition of peace economics is open to a variety of approaches. Virtually all authors acknowledge that peace economics is part of both [[positive economics]] and [[normative economics]].&lt;ref name="CarusoRaul" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, Kenneth J. (1995). "Some General Observations on the Economics of Peace and War, Peace Economics." Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; While for most contemporary economists, work in positive economics may lead them to lay out a descriptive array or evaluation of [[policy]] choices from which one that is most valued is recommended to or chosen by policy makers, in peace economics, in contrast, it is the norm of peace to be achieved that inspires the search for a system design that can reliably deliver on the desired norm.

Peace economics is built on [[general systems theory]] exemplified by the work of [[Kenneth Boulding]].&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, Kenneth E. (1970). "Economics as a Social Science," pp. 1-22 and "Economics as a Political Science," pp. 77-96, both in Kenneth E. Boulding, Economics as a Science. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth may be viewed as a self-regulating ([[homeostatic]]) system, consisting of natural and social subsystems. In each, deviation from a set goal is self-corrected through feedback loops. Homeostatic systems are commonly observed in nature, such as in ecology and in the physiology of organisms (e.g., self-regulation of population sizes, self-regulation of body heat). The systems concept has been adopted in the engineering sciences, for example in designing thermostats. The user sets a desired goal state (temperature), the instrument measures the actual state, and for a deviation of sufficient degree a corrective action is taken (heating or cooling).

Relatively new is the insight that social systems designed to achieve certain purposes (e.g., the retirement or pension system) imply a [[choice architecture]] that may permit failed or failing social systems to persist. Similarly, choice architecture may facilitate the (re)design of institutions aimed at securing beneficial social outcomes such as peace. This is [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] applied to the problem of peace (peace engineering)&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Dietrich. (1993). Nonmilitary Aspects of Security: A Systems Approach. Brookfield, VT: Dartmouth Publ.&lt;/ref&gt; and overlaps with ideas of [[mechanism design]] (reverse game theory) in which a solution is stipulated a priori and the structure of the game that would bring about the desired outcome is inferred. In this way, system design links back to normative economics.

==Examples==

===Free trade and peace===
[[File:Economic connections between US, EU, China, Russia and India.png|thumb|Economic ties between the US, EU, China, Russia and India (thickness of the lines is proportional to the bilateral trade volume)]]
The classical English liberals of the 19th century largely believed that [[free trade]] promoted peace. This view, attributed to [[Adam Smith]] and [[Edmund Burke]], was evident in the advocacy of [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], and in the writings of the most prominent English economists and political thinkers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Alfred Marshall]]. [[John Maynard Keynes]] said that he was "brought up" on this idea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent 20th century US exponent of this idea was the Secretary of State under President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], [[Cordell Hull]].

===World War I and the Paris Peace Conference===

Upon resigning from the United Kingdom's Treasury team at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in June 1919, [[John Maynard Keynes]] penned a small book. Published in 1920, ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'' famously lays out his case for why the allies' Terms of Peace to be imposed on Germany were physically and financially impossible to fulfill and how they would encourage Germany to rise up again. Predicting a coming World War II, Keynes wrote: "... if this view of nations and of their relation to one another (i.e., a [[Carthaginian peace|Carthaginian Peace]]) is adopted by the democracies of Western Europe, and is financed by the United States, heaven help us all. If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp. Nothing can then delay for very long that final civil war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing, and which will destroy, whoever is victor, the civilisation and the progress of our generation."&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, John M. (1920). The Economic Consequences of the Peace. London: Macmillan. The quote is from p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Keynes' effort to change the treaty terms failed, it is a dramatic demonstration of what peace economics is about: the creation of a mutually reinforcing structure of political, economic, and cultural systems to achieve peace such that reversal to violence is unlikely.

===Capitalism and war, and managed capitalism===
In the 1930s, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]] and with the rise of fascist powers, many western socialist and liberal thinkers believed that capitalism caused war. However, Keynes in his ''General Theory of Enployment, Interest and Money'' in 1936, argued that this need not be so, and that the management of capitalism along the lines he proposed to promote high employment would be more conducive to peace than [[laissez-faire]] capitalism with the [[gold standard]] had been. This analysis underlay his approach during World War II to the creation of institutions for international economic governance in the post-war world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapters 5 &amp; 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II, Bretton Woods, and the Marshall Plan===

Late in World War II, as Nazi-Germany's eventual defeat appeared clear, [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]], then-Secretary of the United States Treasury, advocated the partitioning of Germany, stripping it of its most valuable raw materials and industrial assets, and envisioned the complete pastoralization of Germany. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] agreed to the [[Morgenthau Plan]], in modified form, on 16 September 1944. Following victory, Germany's remaining factories were dismantled, parts, machinery, and equipment shipped abroad, patents expropriated, research forbidden, and useful engineers and scientists transferred out of the country. Despite the negotiation of international treaties at [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] to create a set of complementary global monetary, trade, and reconstruction and development institutions, namely the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (today part of the [[World Bank Group]]), and, separately, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (incorporated in today's [[World Trade Organization]]), Germany's and Europe's other postwar economies collapsed. Keynes' Economic Consequences of the Peace appeared to repeat themselves. However, Roosevelt had died and [[Harry S. Truman]] assumed the U.S. American Presidency on 12 April 1945. Even as the deindustrialization of Germany proceeded as planned, Truman's first Secretary of State, [[James F. Byrnes]], by 1947 took a dismal view of its effects on Germany's impoverished population. So did former president [[Herbert C. Hoover]] in a series of reports penned in 1947. Meanwhile, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union emerged as a formidable power and the implication seemed clear: An economically strengthened, resurgent Germany could either be part of a new Western political, economic, and cultural alliance or else be incorporated into a Soviet one. Truman thus came to abolish the punitive measures imposed on Germany, and his new Secretary of State, General [[George C. Marshall]], formulated what would become the [[Marshall Plan]], in effect from 1948 to 1952. The new global institutions and the unilateral Marshall Plan action combined to endow new institutions with sufficient resources to result in a somewhat unwitting peace economics: clearly designed toward the purpose of international peace and prosperity, yet skewed toward Western Europe and the incipient [[Cold War]]. Moreover, the new social architecture was invested with incentives, such as the [[United Nations Security Council]] that provided five of its members with permanent seats and veto powers, that, while keeping superpower peace, threatened peace and prosperity in the post-colonial [[Third World]].

===Origins of the European Union===

Like Keynes, [[Jean Monnet]] participated in the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, in Monnet's case as an assistant to the French delegation. Like Keynes, he envisioned a pan-European economic cooperation zone. Like Keynes, he would be disappointed. Despite this, the French appreciated his good efforts and awarded him with the post of Deputy Secretary-General of the then newly founded [[League of Nations]]. Monnet was but 31 years old. He resigned four years later to devote himself to international business and finance in private capacity but resurfaced during the early World War II years in positions of high influence in France, Britain, and the United States, urging Roosevelt to get on with an industrial armaments plan. Following World War II, Monnet, however, at first crafted the [[Monnet Plan]] which, similar to Morgenthau's, envisioned the transfer of the German [[Ruhr]] and [[Saarland]] territories, raw materials, and industries (coal and steel) to France to assist it in its own reconstruction. This was approved by French Prime Minister [[Charles de Gaulle]] shortly before his resignation in January 1946. The transfer of the Saar region took place with U.S. help in 1947, while the Ruhr region was placed under an international authority in 1949 that assured France access to German coal at low prices. This led to rising frictions between Germany and the allies, just as Keynes had foretold 30 years earlier.

Monnet changed course and, together with Paul Reuter, Bernard Clappier, Pierre Uri, and Étienne Hirsch, plans were crafted that resulted in the [[Schuman Declaration]] of 9 May 1950, celebrated today as [[Europe Day]] or Schuman Day. [[Robert Schuman]], the Franco-German-Luxembourgian statesman, French Minister of Finance, Minister of Foreign Affairs and two-time Prime Minister of France, envisioned, first, a Franco-German and, then, a pan-European sharing of crucial coal and steel resources among Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg that would make future war "not only unthinkable but materially impossible."&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of 9 May 1950." http://www.robert-schuman.eu/declaration_9mai.php. (Retrieved on 14 February 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1951, this resulted in the formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), the forerunner to today's [[European Union]]. In contrast to the negotiations surrounding the founding of the [[United Nations]] and a set of associated organizations in 1945, the European idea appears to have been deliberately designed as a kernel with organic growth-potential, the precise development of which would be learned in future. Thus, no institutional structures were put in place that, due to accrued vested interests, would later prove to be too difficult to change.

===Current research directions===

War at the interstate level has subsided and, to a degree, so have the massive civil wars that took place in the immediate Post-Cold War period (especially in Africa in the 1990s and 2000s).&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2009/2010. Human Security Report Project. http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/20092010/overview.aspx (Retrieved 14 February 2012.) For longer-term trends, see Steven Pinker, ''The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has Declined '' (New York: Viking, 2011) and literature cited therein.&lt;/ref&gt; But violent conflict takes place at many levels, from self-directed harm (e.g., self-injury and [[suicide]]) and [[domestic violence]] between intimate partners and family members to [[workplace violence]] and [[Organized crime|organized criminal violence]], all of which are massively costly and ultimately require positive, structural solutions whereby resort to violence becomes "unthinkable," even as it may remain "materially possible."

The [[Institute for Economics and Peace]], a think tank with offices in Sydney, New York, and Mexico City, is "developing metrics to analyse peace and to quantify its economic value. It does this by developing global and national indices, calculating the economic cost of violence, analysing country level risk and understanding positive peace." &lt;ref&gt;http://economicsandpeace.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''phone connector''', also known as '''phone jack''', '''audio jack''', '''headphone jack''' or '''jack plug''', is a family of electrical connectors typically used for [[analog signal|analog audio signals]]. 

The phone connector was invented for use in [[telephone switchboard]]s in the 19th century and is still widely used. 

The phone connector is cylindrical in shape, with a grooved tip to retain it. In its original audio configuration, it typically has two, three, four and, occasionally, five contacts. Three-contact versions are known as ''TRS connectors'', where ''T'' stands for [[Tip and ring|"tip"]], ''R'' stands for [[Tip and ring|"ring"]] and ''S'' stands for "sleeve". Ring contacts are typically the same diameter as the sleeve, the long shank. Similarly, two-, four- and five- contact versions are called ''TS'', ''TRRS'' and ''TRRRS connectors'' respectively. The outside diameter of the "sleeve" conductor is {{convert|6.35|mm|in|abbr=off|frac=4}}. The "mini" connector has a diameter of {{convert|3.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} and the "sub-mini" connector has a diameter of {{convert|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

== Other terms ==
Specific models, and connectors used in specific applications, may be termed e.g. ''stereo plug'', ''headphone jack'', ''microphone jack'', ''aux input'', etc. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm versions are commonly called ''mini-phone'', ''mini-stereo'', ''mini jack'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = International Library of Technology: ...&amp;nbsp;Principles of Telephony&amp;nbsp;... | publisher = International Textbook Company, Scranton, PA | year = 1907 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BFcJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA11-PA36&amp;dq=tip+ring+sleeve+date:0-1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|reason=No discussion of terminology here, just construction.|date=March 2018}}

In the UK, the terms ''jack plug'' and ''jack socket'' are commonly used for the respective male and female phone connectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Radio Production | author = Robert McLeish | publisher = Newnes | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JzJJ6kg3hLUC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=%22jack+socket%22+%22jack+plug%22 | isbn = 0-240-51972-8 | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, a stationary (more fixed) [[electrical connector]] is called a ''jack''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Standard Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipments: IEEE 200-1975 (Reaffirmed 1988): Section 4.1.5.3 | publisher = IEEE and ANSI, New York, NY | year = 1975 | url = http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=ieee-200-1975&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipment: ASME Y14.44-2008 (Replaced IEEE 200-1975): Section 2.1.5.3 | publisher = ASME, Fairfield, NJ | year = 2008 | url = http://catalog.asme.org/Codes/PrintBook/Y1444_Reference_Designations.cfm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100313114131/http://catalog.asme.org/Codes/PrintBook/Y1444_Reference_Designations.cfm | archivedate = 2010-03-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''phone plug'' and ''phone jack'' are sometimes used to refer to different genders of phone connectors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Sound Reinforcement Handbook | author = Gary D.

Phone plugs and jacks are not to be confused with the similar terms ''phono plug'' and ''phono jack'' (or in the UK, ''phono socket'') which refer to [[RCA connector]]s common in consumer hi-fi and audiovisual equipment. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm connector is, however, sometimes—but counter to the connector manufacturers' nomenclature&lt;ref name="not_mini_phono"/&gt;—referred to as ''mini phono''.&lt;ref name="mini-phono" /&gt;

US 711556 A|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is today still used on mainstream musical equipment, especially on [[electric guitar]]s.

[[Western Electric]] was the manufacturing arm of the [[Bell System]], and thus originated or refined most of the engineering designs, including the telephone jacks and plugs which were later adopted by other industries, including the U.S. Military.

By 1907, Western Electric had designed a number of models for different purposes, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telephonecollectors.info/index.php/browse/document-repository/catalogs-manuals/western-electric/we-catalogs/11201-1907ca-weco-telephonic-apparatus-and-supplies-catalog-ocr-r-large-file/file|title=Western Electric Telephonic Apparatus and Supplies (1907)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Code No. 47 2-conductor plugs for use with type 3, 91, 99, 102, 103, 108, and 124 jacks--used for switchboards
* Code No. 85 3-conductor plugs for use with type 77 jacks--used for the operator's head telephone
* Code No. 103 twin 2-conductor plugs for use with type 91, and type 99 jacks--used for the operator's head telephone and chest transmitter (microphone)
* Code No. 109 3-conductor plugs for use with jack 92 on telephone switchboards (with the same basic shape as the modern Bantam plugs)
* Code No. 110, 3-conductor plug for use with jacks 49, 117, 118, 140, and 141 on switchboards
* Code No. 112, twin 2-conductor plug for use with jacks 91 and 99--used for the operator's head telephone and chest, with a transmitter cutout key (microphone mute)
* Code No. 116, 1-conductor plug for use with cordless jack boxes
* Code No. 126, 3-conductor plug for use with type 132 and type 309 jacks on portable street railway sets

By 1950, the two main plug designs were:

* WE-309 (compatible with {{frac|3|16}}-inch jacks, such as 246 jack), for use on high-density jack panels such as the 608A
* WE-310 (compatible with {{frac|1|4}}-inch jacks, such as the 242)

Several modern designs have descended from those earlier versions:

* B-Gauge standard BPO316 (not compatible with EIA RS-453)
* EIA RS-453: ''Dimensional, Mechanical and Electrical Characteristics Defining Phone Plugs &amp; Jacks'' standard of {{convert|0.206|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter, also found in IEC 60603-11:1992--''Connectors for frequencies below 3 MHz for use with printed boards - Part 11: Detail specification for concentric connectors (dimensions for free connectors and fixed connectors).''

==== Military variants ====
U.S. military versions of the Western Electric plugs were initially specified in Amendment No.1, MIL-P-642, and included:

* M642/1-1
* M642/1-2
* M642/2-1
* M642/2-2
* M642/4-1
* M642/4-2
* MIL-P-642/2, also known as PJ-051. (Similar to Western Electric WE-310, and thus not compatible with EIA RS-453)
* MIL-P-642/5A: Plug, Telephone (TYPE PJ-068) and Accessory Screws (1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carlsonmfg.com/resources/military-specifications-1/1528-mil-dtl-642-5b-pdf-1/file|title=MIL-DTL-642/5B|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and MIL-DTL-642F: Plugs, Telephone, and Accessory Screws (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://landandmaritimeapps.dla.mil/Downloads/MilSpec/Docs/MIL-DTL-642/dtl642.pdf|title=MIL-DTL-642F: Plugs, Telephone, and Accessory Screws|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with {{convert|0.206|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter, also known by the earlier Signal Corps PL-68 designation. These are commonly used as the microphone jack for aviation radios, and on Collins S-line and many Drake amateur radios. MIL-DTL-642F states, "This specification covers telephone plugs used in telephone (including telephone switchboard consoles), telegraph, and teletype circuits, and for connecting headsets, handsets, and microphones into communications circuits."

=== Miniature size ===
The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm or ''miniature'' size was originally designed in the 1950s as two-conductor connectors for earpieces on [[transistor radio]]s, and remains a standard still used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/apple-iphone-headphone-jack-history-1.3755120|title=All-right jack: Simple but effective plug-in has endured for more than a century|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This roughly half-sized version of the original, popularized by the Sony EFM-117J radio (released in 1964),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony history 1960s|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|website=Sony official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Description of 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm earphone jack in described model: {{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vintage-sony-1960-efm-117j-radio-47603127|title=Vintage Sony 1960’S EFM-117J Radio|website=[[WorthPoint]]|accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|reason=Self-published source. Marginally verifies that the radio exists. We need something that at least talks about the phone connector.|date=July 2018}} is still commonly used in portable applications. It became very popular with its application on the [[Walkman]] in 1979, as unlike earlier transistor radios, these devices had no speaker of their own; the usual way to listen to them was to plug in headphones. There is also an EIA standard for 0.141-inch miniature phone jacks.

The 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm or ''sub-miniature'' sizes were similarly popularized on small portable electronics. They often appeared next to a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm microphone jack for a remote control on-off switch on early portable tape recorders; the microphone provided with such machines had the on-off switch and used a two-pronged connector with both the 3.5 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm plugs. They were also used for low-voltage DC power input from wall adapters. In the latter role they were soon replaced by coaxial [[DC power connector]]s. 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm phone jacks have also been used as the headset jacks on mobile telephones (see {{section link||PDAs and mobile phones}}). 

The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm and 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm sizes are sometimes referred to as {{frac|1|8}}&amp;nbsp;in and {{frac|3|32}}&amp;nbsp;in respectively in the United States, though those dimensions are only approximations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=3.5&amp;nbsp;mm Stereo Plug |url=http://www.cui.com/product/resource/sp-3501.pdf |publisher=CUI Inc. |access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; All sizes are now readily available in two-conductor (unbalanced mono) and three-conductor ([[balanced audio|balanced]] mono or unbalanced [[stereophonic sound|stereo]]) versions.

Four-conductor versions of the 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm plug and jack are used for certain applications. A four-conductor version is often used in compact [[camcorder]]s and portable media players, providing stereo sound and composite analog video. It is also used as a combined stereo headphone and microphone connector (i.e. a [[headset (audio)|headset]] connector) on some laptop computers, most [[#Mobile phones|mobile phones]], and on some handheld [[amateur radio]] transceivers from [[Yaesu (brand)|Yaesu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ad7gd.net/vx6/datacable.html|title=Build a Data Cable for the Yaesu VX-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some headphone amplifiers have used it to connect "balanced" stereo headphones, which require two conductors per audio channel as the channels do not share a common ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.lhlabs.com/support/solutions/articles/5000650338-geek-out-v2-user-manual|title=Geek Out V2+ User Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

=== Broadcast usage ===
By the 1940s, broadcast radio stations were using Western Electric Code No. 103 plugs and matching jacks for patching audio throughout studios. This connector was used because of its use in AT&amp;T's Long Line circuits for distribution of audio programs over the radio networks' leased telephone lines. Because of the large amount of space these patch panels required, the industry began switching to 3-conductor plugs and jacks in the late 1940s, using the WE Type 291 plug with WE type 239 jacks. The type 291 plug was used instead of the standard type 110 switchboard plug because the location of the large bulb shape on this TRS plug would have resulted in both audio signal connections being shorted together for a brief moment while the plug is being inserted and removed. The Type 291 plug avoids this by having a shorter tip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chinn|first=Howard|date=July 1947|title=Single Jacks for Broadcast Application|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-NAB-Engineering/NAB-4th-Edition/Section-5--NAB-Engineering-4th-Edition.pdf|journal=Audio Engineering|volume=31, number 6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patch bay connectors ===
The professional audio field and the telecommunication industry use a {{convert|0.173|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter plug, associated with trademarked names including Bantam, TT, Tini-Telephone, and Tini-Tel. They are not compatible with standard EIA RS-453/IEC 60603-11 1/4-inch jacks. In addition to a slightly smaller diameter, they have a slightly different geometry.&lt;ref name="soundonsound-2007-05" /&gt; The three-conductor (TRS for Tip-Ring-Shield) versions are capable of handling [[balanced line]] signals and are used in professional audio installations. Though unable to handle as much power, and less [[reliability engineering|reliable]] than a {{convert|6.35|mm|in|abbr=on}} jack,&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Bill. (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=r86J_aNNReEC&amp;pg=PA202 ''The Ultimate Live Sound Operator's Handbook'', p. 202.] Hal Leonard Corporation. {{ISBN|1-4234-1971-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bantam connectors are used for professional console and outboard [[patchbay]]s in [[studio]] and live sound applications, where large numbers of patch points are needed in a limited space.&lt;ref name="soundonsound-2007-05"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/low-down-analogue-interfacing|title=The Low-down On Analogue Interfacing -|website=www.soundonsound.com|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slightly different shape of Bantam plugs is also less likely to cause shorting as they are plugged in.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Less common ===
Less commonly used sizes, both diameters and lengths, are also available from some manufacturers, and are used when it is desired to restrict the availability of matching connectors, such as 0.210&amp;nbsp;inch inside diameter jacks for fire safety communication jacks in public buildings, the same size found in discontinued [[Bell &amp; Howell]] 16&amp;nbsp;mm projector speaker jacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smartdata.usbid.com/datasheets/dsid/145849.pdf|title=Switchcraft ''Telephone Jack and Telephone Plug Mating Chart''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aadoublejackplug.jpg|thumb|A dual 310 patch cable, two-pin phone plug]]

* A two-pin version, known to the telecom industry as a "310 connector", consists of two phone {{frac|1|4}} inch phone plugs at a centre spacing of {{convert|5/8|in|mm}}. The socket versions of these can be used with normal phone plugs provided the plug bodies are not too large, but the plug version will only mate with two sockets at {{frac|5|8}}&amp;nbsp;inches centre spacing, or with line sockets, again with sufficiently small bodies. These connectors are still widely used today in telephone company central offices on "DSX" patch panels for DS1 circuits. A similar type of 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm connector is often used in the armrests of older aircraft, as part of the on-board [[in-flight entertainment]] system. Plugging a stereo plug into one of the two mono jacks typically results in the audio coming into only one ear. Adapters are available.
* A short-barrelled version was used for 20th century high-impedance mono headphones, and in particular those used in [[World War II aircraft]]. It is physically possible to use a normal plug in a short socket, but a short plug will neither lock into a normal socket nor complete the tip circuit. These have become rare.

==Aviation and US military connectors==
US military phone connectors include both 0.25&amp;nbsp;in (6.35&amp;nbsp;mm) and 0.21&amp;nbsp;in (5.34&amp;nbsp;mm) diameter plugs, which both mate with the M641-series open frame jacks, exemplified by Switchcraft C11 and C12 jacks.

Military specifications and standards relating to phone connectors include MIL-STD 202, MIL-P-642/*, and MIL-J-641.

=== Headphones ===
Commercial and [[general aviation]] (GA) civil airplane headset plugs are similar, but not identical. A standard {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in monaural plug, type PL-55&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radionerds.com/index.php/PL-55|title=PL-55|last=|first=|date=|website=Radionerds.com|access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (both two-conductor phone plugs, a.k.a. PJ-055B, which mate with JK-24 and JK-34A jacks) is used for headphones. On many newer GA aircraft the headphone jack is a standard {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in phone connector wired in the standard unbalanced stereo configuration instead of the PJ-055 to allow stereo music sources to be reproduced.

=== Microphones ===
Aviation headphones are paired with special tip-ring-sleeve, 0.206&amp;nbsp;inch/5.23&amp;nbsp;mm diameter plug, type PJ-068 (PL-68&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radionerds.com/index.php/PL-68|title=PL-68|last=|first=|date=|website=Radionerds.com|access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, for the microphone. The PJ-068 mates with a JK-33 jack (Switchcraft C-12B), and is similar to the Western Electric plug WE-109.

In the microphone plug the Ring is used for the microphone 'hot' and the sleeve is common or microphone 'Lo'. The extra (tip) connection in the microphone plug is often left unconnected but is also sometimes used for various functions, most commonly an optional push-to-talk switch, but on some aircraft it carries headphone audio and on others a DC supply.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[File:Aircraft plug.gif|thumb|Aviation plug type U-174/U or Nexus TP120, commonly used on military aircraft and civil helicopters]]

=== Helicopter headsets ===
Military aircraft and civil helicopters have another type termed a U-174/U. These are also termed 'NATO plugs' or Nexus TP120&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nexinc.thomasnet.com/item/all-categories/telephone-plugs/tp-120|title=Item # TP-120, Telephone Plug|work=|publisher=Amphenol Nexus Technologies, Inc|accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; phone plugs. They are similar to {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in (6.35&amp;nbsp;mm) plug, but with a {{convert|7.10|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter short shaft with an extra ring, i.e. four conductors in total, allowing two for the headphones (mono), and two for the microphone. There is a confusingly similar four pole (or four conductor) British connector with a slightly smaller diameter and a different wiring configuration used for headsets in many UK Military aircraft and often also referred to as a NATO or 'UK NATO' connector.

== Mono and stereo compatibility ==

[[File:2-conductor male TS connectors.jpg|thumb|right|Modern profile 2-conductor male {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in TS connectors]]

The original application for the 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in) phone jack was in manual telephone exchanges.&lt;ref name="ParekhRanjan2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ranjan Parekh|author2=Ranjan|title=Principles of Multimedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TaNmc2IdNVwC&amp;pg=PA225|year=2006|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-058833-2|pages=225–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many different configurations of these phone plugs were used, some accommodating five or more conductors, with several tip profiles. Of these many varieties, only the two-conductor version with a rounded tip profile was compatible between different manufacturers, and this was the design that was at first adopted for use with [[microphone]]s, [[electric guitar]]s, [[headphones]], [[loudspeaker]]s, and many other items of audio equipment.

When a three-conductor version of the 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm jack was introduced for use with [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] headphones, it was given a sharper tip profile in order to make it possible to manufacture jacks (sockets) that would accept only stereo plugs, to avoid short-circuiting the right channel of the amplifier. This attempt has long been abandoned, and now the convention is that all plugs fit all sockets of the same size, regardless of whether they are balanced or unbalanced, mono or stereo. Most 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm plugs, mono or stereo, now have the profile of the original stereo plug, although a few rounded mono plugs are also still produced. The profiles of stereo miniature and subminiature plugs have always been identical to the mono plugs of the same size.

The results of this physical compatibility are:
*If a two-conductor plug of the same size is connected to a three-conductor socket, the result is that the ring (right channel) of the socket is grounded. This property is deliberately used in several applications. However, grounding one channel may also be dangerous to the equipment if the result is to [[short circuit]] the output of the right channel [[amplifier]]. In any case, any signal from the right channel is naturally lost.
*If a three-conductor plug is connected to a two-conductor socket, normally the result is to leave the ring of the plug unconnected (open circuit). In the days of [[vacuum tube]]s this was also potentially dangerous to equipment but most solid-state devices tolerate this condition well. A three-conductor socket could be wired as an unbalanced mono socket to ground the ring in this situation, but the more conventional wiring is to leave the ring unconnected, exactly simulating a mono socket.
*If a male three-conductor plug is partially inserted into a female two-conductor socket such that the female ring contact bridges the gap of the male plug tip and first ring, then an identical signal will be connected to both these conductors, thus simulating a "Y" connection. This is not a reliable connection and is only useful in a test or emergency situation. Analog low and line level audio circuits usually tolerate this well if the volume (current) is not excessive, though other circuits may not because of the typical surge current that occurs at the moment all three conductors engage. Common example of condition: a typical 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm earphone socket of a mono radio or micro amp has a stereo headphone plug partly inserted. Mono audio should be delivered to both speakers if the plug depth is carefully adjusted in the socket.

Because of a lack of standardization in the past regarding the dimensions (length) given to the ring conductor and the insulating portions on either side of it in 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in) phone connectors and the width of the conductors in different brands and generations of sockets, there are occasional issues with compatibility between differing brands of plug and socket. This can result in a contact in the socket bridging (shorting) the ring and sleeve contacts on a phone connector.

[[File:Klinkenstecker 5-polig.jpg|thumb|A 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm 5-conductor TRRRS phone connector]]

The most common arrangement remains to have the male plug on the cable and the female socket mounted in a piece of equipment: the original intention of the design. A considerable variety of line plugs and panel sockets is available, including plugs suiting various cable sizes, right-angle plugs, and both plugs and sockets in a variety of price ranges and with current capacities up to 15 [[ampere]]s for certain heavy duty {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in versions intended for [[loudspeaker]] connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fullcompass.com/product/292346.html |title=Switchcraft Z15J 1/4" High Power Speaker Jack |publisher=Full Compass |accessdate=October 24, 2011 |quote=High power 2-conductor speaker jack carries 15A (continuous) audio speaker current levels.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common uses of phone plugs and their matching sockets are:

*[[Headphone]] and [[earphone]] jacks on a wide range of equipment. 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in) plugs are common on home and professional component equipment, while 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm plugs are nearly universal for portable audio equipment. 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm plugs are not as common, but are used on communication equipment such as [[cordless phone]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, and [[two-way radio]]s.
* Consumer electronics devices such as [[digital cameras]], [[camcorders]], and [[portable DVD player]]s use 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm connectors for composite video and audio output. Typically, a TRS connection is used for mono unbalanced audio plus video, and a TRRS connection for stereo unbalanced audio plus video. Cables designed for this use are often terminated with [[RCA connectors]] on the other end. Sony also used this style of connection as the TV-Out on some models of VAIO laptop.
* Hands-free sets and headsets often use 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm or 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm connectors. Phone connectors are used for mono audio out and an unbalanced microphone (with a shared ground). Four-conductor TRRS phone connectors are used to add an additional audio channel such as microphone input added to stereo output. TRRS connectors used for this purpose are sometimes interoperable with TRS connectors, depending on how the contacts are used.
*[[Microphone]] inputs on tape and cassette recorders, sometimes with remote control switching on the ring, on early, monaural cassette recorders mostly a dual-pin version consisting of a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TS for the microphone and a 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm TS for remote control which switches the recorder's power supply.
*Patching points ([[Insert (effects processing)|insert points]]) on a wide range of equipment.
*[[Personal computers]], sometimes using a [[sound card]] plugged into the computer. Stereo 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm jacks are used for:
**Line in (stereo)
**Line out (stereo)
**Headphones/loudspeaker out (stereo)
**Microphone input (mono, usually with 5&amp;nbsp;V power available on the ring. Note that traditional, incompatible, use of a stereo plug for a mono microphone is for balanced output)
**Older [[laptop computers]] generally have one jack for headphones and one mono jack for a microphone at microphone level. An attenuating cable can be used to convert [[line level]] or use a signal from an [[XLR connector]], but is not designed to record from a stereo device such as a radio or music player. Newer computers may feature a single TRRS female jack ([[#Computer sound|see below]]).
** [[Moog synthesizer]]s and plug modifiable synthesizers.
**LCD monitors with built-in speakers will need a cable with 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm male TRS plugs on each end to connect to the sound card.
**: Note: Some higher-end sound cards provide a breakout panel which supports {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in plug devices as well.
*Devices designed for surround output may use multiple jacks for paired channels (e.g. TRS for front left and right; TRRS for front center, rear center, and subwoofer; and TRS for surround left and right). Circuitry on the sound device may be used to switch between traditional Line In/Line Out/Mic functions and surround output.
*[[Electric guitar]]s. Almost all electric guitars use a {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in mono jack (socket) as their output connector. Some makes (such as [[Shergold]]) use a stereo jack instead for stereo output, or a second stereo jack, in addition to a mono jack (as with [[Rickenbacker]]).
*[[Instrument amplifier]]s for guitars, basses and similar amplified [[musical instrument]]s. {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in jacks are overwhelmingly the most common connectors for:
**Inputs. A shielded cable with a mono {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in phone plug on each end is commonly termed a ''guitar cable'' or a ''patch cable'', the first name reflecting this usage, the second the history of the phone plug's development for use in manual telephone exchanges.
**[[Loudspeaker]] outputs, especially on low-end equipment. On professional loudspeakers, [[Speakon]] connectors carry higher current, mate with greater contact area, lock in place and do not short out the amplifier upon insertion or disconnection. However, some professional loudspeakers carry both Speakon and TRS connectors for compatibility. Heavy-duty {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in loudspeaker jacks are rated at 15&amp;nbsp;A maximum which limits them to applications involving less than 1,800 watts. {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in loudspeaker jacks commonly are not rigged to lock the plug in place and will short out the amplifier's output circuitry if connected or disconnected when the amplifier is live.
**Line outputs.
**Foot switches and effects pedals. Stereo plugs are used for double switches (for example by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]). There is little compatibility between makers.
**Effects loops, which are normally wired as patch points.
*[[Electronic keyboard]]s use jacks for a similar range of uses to guitars and amplifiers, and in addition
**Sustain pedals.
**Expression pedals.
*[[Electronic drum]]s use jacks to connect sensor pads to the [[synthesizer]] module or [[MIDI]] encoder. In this usage, a change in voltage on the wire indicates a drum stroke.
*Some compact and/or economy model audio [[mixing desk]]s use stereo jacks for balanced microphone inputs.
*The majority of professional audio equipment uses TS jacks as the standard unbalanced input or output line-level connector. TRS jacks are sometimes used for balanced connections, the latter often alongside (or sometimes in the middle of) and as an alternative to an [[XLR connector|XLR]] balanced line connector.
* [[Modular synthesizer]]s commonly use monophonic cables for creating [[patch (synthesizer)|patches]].
* Quarter-inch phone connectors are widely used to connect external processing devices to [[mixing console]]s' insert points (see [[Insert (effects processing)]]). Two- or three-conductor phone connectors might be used in pairs as separate ''send'' and ''return'' jacks, or a single three-conductor phone jack might be employed for both ''send'' and ''return'', in which case the signals are unbalanced. The one unbalanced combination send/return TRS insert jack saves both panel space and component complexity, but may introduce a slight [[Mains hum|buzz]]. Insert points on mixing consoles may also be XLR, RCA or bantam TT (tiny telephone) jacks, depending on the make and model.
*Some small electronic devices such as audio cassette players, especially in the cheaper price brackets, use a two-conductor 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm or 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm phone jack as a [[DC connector|DC power connector]].
*Some photographic studio [[strobe]] lights have {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in or 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm jacks for the [[flash synchronization]] input. A camera's electrical flash output (PC socket or [[hot shoe]] adapter) is cabled to the strobe light's sync input jacks. Some examples: Calumet Travelite, and Speedotron use a {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in mono jack as the sync input; White Lightning uses {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in stereo jacks; PocketWizard (radio trigger) and AlienBees use 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm mono jacks.
*Some cameras (for example, Canon, Sigma, and Pentax [[DSLR]]s) use the 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm stereo jack for the connector for the remote shutter release (and focus activation); examples are Canon's RS-60E3 remote switch and Sigma's CR-21 wired remote control.
*Some miniaturized electronic devices use 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm or 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm jacks as [[serial port]] connectors for data transfer and unit programming. This technique is particularly common on [[graphing calculators]], such as the [[TI-83 series]], and some types of [[amateur radio|amateur]] and [[two-way radio]], though in some more modern equipment [[Universal Serial Bus|USB mini-B]] connectors are provided in addition to or instead of jack connectors. The second-generation [[iPod Shuffle]] from Apple has one TRRS jack which serves as headphone, USB, or power supply, depending on the connected plug.
* Samsung YP-S MP3 player "pebble" uses USB-to-3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRRS jack adapter for charging as well as for data transfer.
* On [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras and video encoders, mono audio in (originating from a microphone in or near the camera) and mono audio out (destined to a speaker in or near the camera) are provided on one three-conductor connector, where one signal is on the tip conductor and the other is on the ring conductor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resource.boschsecurity.com/documents/Operation_Guide_enUS_1555473931.pdf, page 113] (PDF) boschsecurity.com Retrieved January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Atari 2600 (Video Computer System), the first widely popular home video game console with interchangeable software programs, used a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TS (two conductor) jack for 9&amp;nbsp;V 500&amp;nbsp;mA DC power. Later systems included the [[ZX Spectrum]] (for loading software from cassette) and the [[Sega Mega Drive]] (for stereo audio output).
* The [[Apple Lisa]] personal computer used a three-conductor TRS phone connector for its keyboard.
* The Sangean DCR-200 radio uses a wire aerial terminating with a 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm phone connector.

[[Personal computer]] [[sound card]]s, such as [[Creative Labs]]' [[Sound Blaster]] line, use a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm phone connector as a mono microphone input, and deliver a 5&amp;nbsp;V polarizing voltage on the ring to power [[electret microphone]]s. Sometimes termed ''phantom power'', this is not a suitable power source for microphones designed for true [[phantom power]] and is better termed ''bias voltage''. (Note that this is not a polarizing voltage for the condenser, as [[electret]]s by definition have an intrinsic voltage; it is power for a [[FET]] preamplifier built into the microphone.) Compatibility between different manufacturers is unreliable.

The [[Apple Inc|Apple]] [[PlainTalk]] microphone jack used on some older Macintosh systems is designed to accept an extended 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm three-conductor phone connector; in this case, the tip carries power for a [[preamplifier]] inside the microphone. If a PlainTalk-compatible microphone is not available, the jack can accept a [[line-level]] sound input, though it cannot accept a standard microphone without a preamp.

Normally, 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm three-conductor sockets are used in computer sound cards for stereo output. Thus, for a sound card with 5.1 output, there will be three sockets to accommodate six channels: "front left and right", "surround left and right", and "center + subwoofer". 6.1 and 7.1 channel sound cards from Creative Labs, however, use a single three-conductor socket (for the ''front'' speakers) and two 4-conductor sockets. This is to accommodate rear-center (6.1) or rear left and right (7.1) channels without the need for additional sockets on the sound card. (Note that Creative's documentation uses the word "pole" instead of "conductor".)

Some portable computers have a combined 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[TOSLINK|TRS-TOSLINK]] jack, supporting stereo audio output using a TRS connector, or TOSLINK (stereo or 5.1 [[Dolby Digital]]/[[DTS (sound system)|DTS]]) digital output using a suitable optical adapter. Most iMac computers have this digital/analog combo output feature as standard, with early MacBooks having two ports, one for analog/digital audio input and other for output. Support for input was dropped on various later models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macaudiopro.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=69934|title=''Questions Answered 4: Optical Output on the Mac''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=900687|title=''Audio input/output on Macbook computers.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some newer computers, such as Lenovo laptops, have 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRRS headset sockets, which are compatible with phone headsets and may be distinguished by a headset icon instead of the usual headphones or microphone icons. These are particularly used for [[Voice over IP]].

== Video ==
[[File:TRRS_3.5mm_-_2_length_variants.jpg|thumb|Different length 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRRS connectors]]

Equipment requiring video with stereo audio input/output sometimes uses 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRRS connectors. Two incompatible variants exist, of {{convert|15|mm}} and {{convert|17|mm|abbr=on}} length, and using the wrong variant may either simply not work, or could cause physical damage.

Attempting to fully insert the longer (17&amp;nbsp;mm) plug into a receptacle designed for the shorter (15&amp;nbsp;mm) plug may damage the receptacle, and may damage any electronics located immediately behind the receptacle. However, partially inserting the plug will work as the tip/ring/ring distances are the same for both variants.

Using the shorter plug in a socket designed for the longer connector will result in the plug not 'locking in', and may additionally result in wrong signal routing and/or a short circuit inside the equipment (e.g. the plug tip may cause the contacts inside the receptacle - tip/ring 1, etc. - to short together).

The shorter 15&amp;nbsp;mm TRRS variant is more common and fully physically compatible with 'standard' 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRS and TS connectors.

== Recording equipment ==

[[File:Jackplug-wiring.svg|thumb|right|Stereo devices which use "plug-in power": the electret capsules are wired in this way.]]

Many small video cameras, laptops, recorders and other consumer devices use a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm microphone connector for attaching a (mono/stereo) microphone to the system.
These fall into three categories:
* Devices that use an un-powered microphone: usually a cheap [[Microphones#Dynamic microphone|dynamic]] or [[Microphones#Piezoelectric microphone|piezoelectric]] microphone. The microphone generates its own voltage, and needs no power.
* Devices that use a self-powered microphone: usually a [[Microphones#Condenser microphone|condenser]] microphone with internal battery-powered amplifier.
* Devices that use a "plug-in powered" microphone: an [[electret microphone]] containing an internal [[Field-effect transistor|FET]] amplifier. These provide a good quality signal, in a very small microphone. However, the internal FET needs a DC power supply, which is provided as a bias voltage for an internal preamp transistor.

Plug-in power is supplied on the same line as the audio signal, using an RC filter. The DC bias voltage supplies the FET amplifier (at a low current), while the capacitor decouples the DC supply from the AC input to the recorder. Typically, V=1.5 V, R=1 kΩ, C=47&amp;nbsp;µF.

If a recorder provides plug-in power, and the microphone does not need it, everything will usually work ok, although the sound quality may be lower than expected, as the microphone may not work optimally with a constant DC current flowing through it. In the converse case (recorder provides no power; microphone needs power), no sound will be recorded. Neither misconfiguration will damage consumer hardware, but providing power when none is needed could destroy a broadcast-type microphone.

== PDAs and mobile phones ==

[[File:iPod and iPhone audio plugs.JPG|thumb|All [[iPhone]] models from the first generation to the 6S and SE use a four-conductor (TRRS) phone connector (center) for a wired headset. Microphone and control (right).]]
Three- or four-conductor (TRS or TRRS) 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm and 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm sockets are common on [[cell phone]]s, providing mono (three conductor) or stereo (four conductor) sound and a microphone input, together with signaling (e.g., push a button to answer a call). Three-conductor 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm connectors are particularly common on older phones, while four-conductor 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm connectors are more common on newer smartphones. These are used both for [[handsfree]] [[Headset (audio)|headsets]] (esp. mono audio plus mic, also stereo audio plus mic, plus signaling for call handling) and for (stereo) headphones (stereo audio, no mic). Wireless (connectorless) headsets or headphones usually use the [[Bluetooth]] protocol.

There is no recognised standard for TRRS connectors or compatibility with three conductor TRS. The four conductors of a TRRS connector are assigned to different purposes by different manufacturers. Any 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm plug can be plugged mechanically into any socket, but many combinations are electrically incompatible. For example, plugging TRRS headphones into a TRS headset socket (or vice versa) or plugging TRRS headphones from one manufacturer into a TRRS socket from another may not function correctly, or at all. Mono audio will usually work, but stereo audio or microphone may not work, depending on wiring. Signaling compatibility depends both on wiring compatibility and the signals sent by the hands-free/headphones controller being correctly interpreted by the phone.{{original research inline|date=November 2012}} Adapters that are wired for headsets will not work for stereo headphones and conversely. Further, as TTY/[[Telecommunications device for the deaf|TDD]]s are wired as headsets, TTY adapters can also be used to connect a 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm headset to a phone.

3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRRS (stereo-plus-mic) sockets became particularly common on [[smartphones]], and have been used e.g. by Nokia since 2006; they are often compatible with standard 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm stereo headphones. Two different forms are frequently found, both of which place left audio on the tip and right audio on the first ring (mirroring the configuration found on stereo connectors). Where they differ is in the placement of the microphone and return contacts. The first, which places the ground return on the second ring and the microphone on the sleeve, is used by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]] line, [[HTC]] devices, recent [[Samsung]], [[Nokia]], and [[Sony Mobile Communications|Sony]] phones, among others. The second, which reverses these contacts, is used by older Nokia mobiles, older [[Samsung]] smartphones, and some [[Sony Ericsson]] phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.meelec.com/Articles.asp?ID=155#Compatibility |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227131931/https://www.meelec.com/Articles.asp?ID=155#Compatibility |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-12-27 |title=MEElectronics - P version headset earphone compatibility |publisher=Meelec.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some adapters switch the last two conductors to allow a device made to one standard to be used with a headset made to the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digital-silence.com/support.html Digital Silence (earphone manufacturer)]: explanation of TRRS connectors and availability of adapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some computers now include a TRRS headset socket, compatible with headsets intended for smartphones. One such pin assignment, with ground on the sleeve, is standardized in [[OMTP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omtp.org/OMTP_Local_Connectivity_Wired_Analogue_Audio_v1_0.pdf|title=Wired Analogue Audio|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been accepted as a national Chinese standard YDT 1885-2009.

=== TRRRS standards ===
New TRRRS standard for 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm connectors was developed and recently approved by ITU-T.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/itu-t/workprog/wp_item.aspx?isn=9990|title=ITU-T Work Programme|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new standard, called P.382 (formerly P.MMIC), outlines technical requirements and test methods for a 5-pole socket and plug configuration. Compared to legacy TRRS standard TRRRS provides one extra line that can be used for connecting a second microphone or external power to/from the audio accessory. P.382 requires compliant sockets and plugs to be backwards compatible with legacy TRRS and TRS connectors. Therefore, P.382 compliant TRRRS connectors should allow for seamless integration when used on new products. TRRRS connectors enable following audio applications: active noise cancelling, binaural recording and others, where dual analogue microphone lines can be directly connected to a host device.

== Switch contacts ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2007}}
[[File:Small jack plugs.jpg|thumb|Miniature phone plugs and jacks. All are 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm except the gold-plated plug, which is 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm. One of the 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm jacks is two-conductor and the others are three conductor. In this collection the tan-colored jacks have normally-closed switches.]]

Panel-mounting jacks are often provided with switch contacts. Most commonly, a mono jack is provided with one normally closed (NC) contact, which is connected to the tip (live) connection when no plug is in the socket, and disconnected when a plug is inserted. Stereo sockets commonly provide two such NC contacts, one for the tip (left channel live) and one for the ring or collar (right channel live). Some designs of jack also have such a connection on the sleeve. As this contact is usually ground, it is not much use for signal switching, but could be used to indicate to electronic circuitry that the socket was in use.

Less commonly, some jacks are provided with normally open (NO) or change-over contacts, and/or the switch contacts may be isolated from the connector.

The original purpose of these contacts was for switching in telephone exchanges, for which there were many patterns. Two sets of change-over contacts, isolated from the connector contacts, were common. The more recent pattern of one NC contact for each signal path, internally attached to the connector contact, stems from their use as headphone jacks. In many amplifiers and equipment containing them, such as electronic organs, a headphone jack is provided that disconnects the loudspeakers when in use. This is done by means of these switch contacts. In other equipment, a dummy load is provided when the headphones are not connected. This is also easily provided by means of these NC contacts.

Other uses for these contacts have been found. One is to interrupt a signal path to enable other circuitry to be inserted. This is done by using one NC contact of a stereo jack to connect the tip and ring together when no plug is inserted. The tip is then made the output, and the ring the input (or vice versa), thus forming a [[patch point]].

Another use is to provide alternative mono or stereo output facilities on some guitars and electronic organs. This is achieved by using two mono jacks, one for left channel and one for right, and wiring the NC contact on the right channel jack to the tip of the other, to connect the two connector tips together when the right channel output is not in use. This then mixes the signals so that the left channel jack doubles as a mono output.

Where a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm or 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm jack is used as a DC power inlet connector, a switch contact may be used to disconnect an internal battery whenever an external power supply is connected, to prevent incorrect recharging of the battery.

A standard stereo jack is used on most battery-powered guitar [[effects pedal]]s to eliminate the need for a separate power switch. In this configuration, the internal battery has its negative terminal wired to the sleeve contact of the jack. When the user plugs in a two-conductor (mono) guitar or microphone lead, the resulting short-circuit between sleeve and ring connects an internal battery to the unit's circuitry, ensuring that it powers up or down automatically whenever a signal lead is inserted or removed. A drawback of this design is the risk of inadvertently discharging the battery if the lead is not removed after use, such as if the equipment is left plugged in overnight.

== Design ==
[[File:Phone jack symbols.png|thumb|Examples of jack configurations, oriented so the plug 'enters' from the right. The most common circuit configurations are the simple mono and stereo jacks (A and B); however there are a great number of variants manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Schematics table|url=http://www.switchcraft.com/Documents/Jack_Schematics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A two-conductor TS phone connector. The connection to the sleeve is the rectangle towards the right, and the connection to the tip is the line with the notch. Wiring connections are illustrated as white circles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A three-conductor TRS phone connector. The upper connector is the tip, as it is farther away from the sleeve. The sleeve is shown connected directly to the chassis, a very common configuration. This is the typical configuration for a balanced connection. Some jacks have metal mounting connections (which would make this connection) and some have plastic, to isolate the sleeve from the chassis, and provide a separate sleeve connection point, as in ''A''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This three-conductor jack has two isolated [[Contact terminology|SPDT]] [[switch]]es. They are activated by a plug going into the jack, which disconnects one throw and connects the other. The white arrowheads indicate a mechanical connection, while the black arrowheads indicate an electrical connection. This would be useful for a device that turns on when a plug is inserted, and off otherwise, with the power routed through the switches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This three-conductor jack has two normally closed switches connected to the contacts themselves. This would be useful for a patch point, for instance, or for allowing another signal to feed the line until a plug is inserted. The switches open when a plug is inserted. A common use for this style of connector is a stereo headphone jack that shuts off the default output (speakers) when the connector is plugged in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;]]

=== Balanced audio ===

When a phone connector is used to make a [[balanced audio connector|balanced]] connection, the two active conductors are both used for a [[monaural]] signal. The ring, used for the right channel in stereo systems, is used instead for the inverting input. This is a common use in small audio [[mixing desk]]s, where space is a premium and they offer a more compact alternative to [[XLR connector]]s. Another advantage offered by TRS phone connectors used for balanced microphone inputs is that a standard unbalanced signal lead using a TS phone jack can simply be plugged into such an input. The ring (right channel) contact then makes contact with the plug body, correctly grounding the inverting input.

A disadvantage of using phone connectors for balanced audio connections is that the ground mates last and the socket grounds the plug tip and ring when inserting or disconnecting the plug. This causes bursts of hum, cracks and pops and may stress some outputs as they will be short circuited briefly, or longer if the plug is left half in.

One convention that avoided this brief shorting in the professional audio world was to use the following convention for XLR and PJ-051/WE-310 patch bays, so that, "By making the tip of the jack the low side of the line, the high side is physically protected against momentary shorts when patching in and out of the jackfield.":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woram|first=John M.|date=October 1975|title=The Sync Track|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-DB-Magazine/70s/DB-1975-10.pdf|journal=db Magazine: The Sound Engineering Magazine|volume=9|pages=16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem does not occur when using the 'gauge B' (BPO) phone connector (PO 316)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neutrik.com/en/audio/plugs-and-jacks/mil-b-gauge-type/|title=''Neutrik mil-b-gauge-type plugs''}}&lt;/ref&gt; which although it is of 0.25&amp;nbsp;in (6.3&amp;nbsp;mm) diameter has a smaller tip and a recessed ring so that the ground contact of the socket never touches the tip or ring of the plug. This type was designed for balanced audio use, being the original telephone 'switchboard' connector and is still common in broadcast, telecommunications and many professional audio applications where it is vital that permanent circuits being monitored (bridged) are not interrupted by the insertion or removal of connectors. This same tapered shape used in the 'gauge B' (BPO) plug can be seen also in aviation and military applications on various diameters of jack connector including the PJ-068 and 'bantam' plugs. The more common straight-sided profile used in domestic and commercial applications and discussed in most of this article is known as 'gauge A'.

XLR connectors used in much professional audio equipment mate the ground signal on pin 1 first.

=== Unbalanced audio ===

Phone connectors with three conductors are also commonly used as unbalanced audio ''patch points'' (or ''insert points'', or simply ''inserts''), with the output on many mixers found on the tip (left channel) and the input on the ring (right channel). This is often expressed as "tip send, ring return". Other mixers have unbalanced insert points with "ring send, tip return". One advantage of this system is that the switch contact within the panel socket, originally designed for other purposes, can be used to close the circuit when the patch point is not in use. An advantage of the ''tip send'' patch point is that if it is used as an output only, a 2-conductor mono phone plug correctly grounds the input. In the same fashion, use of a "tip return" insert style allows a mono phone plug to bring an unbalanced signal directly into the circuit, though in this case the output must be robust enough to withstand being grounded. Combining ''send'' and ''return'' functions via single {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in TRS connectors in this way is seen in very many professional and semi-professional audio mixing desks, because it halves the space needed for insert jack fields which would otherwise need two jacks, one for ''send'' and one for ''return''. The tradeoff is that unbalanced signals are more prone to buzz, [[Mains hum|hum]] and outside interference.

In some three-conductor TRS phone inserts, the concept is extended by using specially designed phone jacks that will accept a mono phone plug partly inserted ''to the first click'' and will then connect the tip to the signal path without breaking it. Most standard phone connectors can also be used in this way with varying success, but neither the switch contact nor the tip contact can be relied upon unless the internal contacts have been designed with extra strength for holding the plug tip in place. Even with stronger contacts, an accidental mechanical movement of the inserted plug can interrupt signal within the circuit. For maximum reliability, any usage involving ''first click'' or ''half-click'' positions will instead rewire the plug to short tip and ring together and then insert this modified plug all the way into the jack.

The TRS ''tip return, ring send'' unbalanced insert configuration is mostly found on older mixers. This allowed for the insert jack to serve as a standard-wired mono line input that would bypass the mic preamp. However tip send has become the generally accepted standard for mixer inserts since the early-to-mid 1990s. The TRS ''ring send'' configuration is still found on some compressor sidechain input jacks such as the dbx 166XL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbxpro.com/166XL/166XL.php|title=dbx 166XL compressor with balanced TRS ''tip send'' input and output jacks and one TRS ''ring send'' sidechain jack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some very compact equipment, 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRS phone connectors are used as patch points.

Some [[sound recording]] devices use a three-conductor phone connector as a mono microphone input, using the tip as the signal path and the ring to connect a standby switch on the microphone.

===Poor connections===

Connectors that are tarnished, or that were not manufactured within tight tolerances, are prone to cause poor connections.&lt;ref name="soundonsound-2005-06"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/q-whats-wrong-my-patchbay|title=Q. What's wrong with my patchbay? -|website=www.soundonsound.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending upon the surface material of the connectors, tarnished ones can be cleaned with a burnishing agent (for solid brass contacts typical) or contact cleaner (for plated contacts).&lt;ref name="soundonsound-2005-06"/&gt;

The top section is a cross-sectional view with bordered pits shown between adjacent cells, and the bottom section is a radial view with numerous bordered pits shown.]]

'''Pits''' are thin portions of the [[cell wall]] that adjacent [[cell (biology)|cell]]s can [[Cell communication|communicate]] or exchange fluid through. Pits are characteristic of cell walls with [[Cell wall#Rigidity of cell walls|secondary layers]]. Generally each pit has a complementary pit opposite of it in the neighboring cell. These complementary pits are called "pit pairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Introduction to Plant Cell Development |author= Jeremy Burgess |edition= |publisher= CUP Archive |year= 1985 |isbn= 9780521316118 |page= 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pits are composed of three parts: the pit chamber, the pit aperture, and the pit membrane. The pit chamber is the hollow area where the secondary layers of the cell wall are absent. The pit aperture is the opening at either end of the pit chamber. The pit membrane is the primary cell wall and [[middle lamella]], or the membrane between adjacent cell walls, at the middle of the pit chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Esau's Plant Anatomy: Meristems, Cells, and Tissues of the Plant Body: Their Structure, Function, and Development |author= Ray F. Evert |edition= third, illustrated |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2006 |isbn= 9780470047378 |page= 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary cell wall at the pit membrane may also have depressions similar to the pit depressions of the secondary layers. These depressions are primary pit-fields, or primary pits. In the primary pit, the primordial pit provides an interruption in the primary cell wall that the [[plasmodesmata]] can cross. The primordial pit is the only aperture in the otherwise continuous primary cell wall.&lt;ref name=PlantAnat&gt;{{cite book |title=Anatomy of Seed Plants |series=Plant Anatomy |edition=2nd |author=Katherine Easu |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=51 |year= 1977 |isbn=0-471-24520-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pit pairs are a characteristic feature of the [[xylem]], as [[sap]] flows through the pits of xylem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Three-dimensional Structure of Wood: A Scanning Electron Microscope Study; Volume 2 of Syracuse wood science series |author= B. A. Meylan, Brian Geoffrey Butterfield |edition= illustrated |publisher= Syracuse University Press |year= 1972 |isbn= 9780815650300 |page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of pits==
[[File:Simple Pit Pair.jpg|thumb|A simplified diagram of a simple pit pair]]

Though pits are usually simple and complementary, a few more pit variations can be formed:

*Simple pits: A pit pair in which the diameter of the pit chamber and the diameter of the pit aperture are equal.

*Bordered pits: A pit pair in which the pit chamber is over-arched by the cell wall, creating a larger pit chamber and smaller pit aperture.

*Half bordered pits: A pit pair in which a bordered pit has a complementary simple pit. Such a pit pair is called half bordered pit pair.

*Blind pits: A pit pair in which a simple pit has no complementary pit.

*Compound pits: A pit pair in which one cell wall has a large pit and the adjacent cell wall has numerous, small pits.

==Plasmodesmata==
{{Main|Plasmodesma}}

Plasmodesmata are thin sections of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] that traverse pits and connect adjacent cells. These sections provide an avenue of transport through the pits and facilitate communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Introduction to Plant Structure and Development: Plant Anatomy for the Twenty-First Century |author= Charles B. Beck |edition= second, revised |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2010 |isbn= 9781139486361 |page= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasmodesmata are not restricted to pits however, as plasmodesmata often cross a cell wall of constant width and occasionally the cell wall is even wider in areas where plasmodesmata traverse it.&lt;ref name=PlantAnat/&gt;

==Torus and margo==
[[File:Torus and Margo.png|thumb|A simplified diagram of a bordered pit-pair with a torus and margo. The top shows an unobstructed pit and the bottom shows an aspirated pit, with the margo flexing under stress.]]
The torus and margo are characteristic features of bordered pit-pairs in [[gymnosperms]], such as [[Coniferales]], ''[[Ginkgo]]'', and ''[[Gnetales]]''. In other [[vascular plants]], the torus is rare. The pit membrane is separated into two parts: a thick impermeable torus at the center of the pit membrane, and the permeable margo surrounding it. The torus regulates the functions of the bordered pit, and the margo is a cell wall-derived porous membrane that supports the torus. The margo is composed of bundles of [[microfibril]]s that radiate from the torus.&lt;ref name=PlantAnat/&gt;

The margo is flexible and can move towards either side of the pit while under stress. This allows the thick, impermeable torus to block the pit aperture. When the torus is displaced so that it blocks the pit aperture, the pit is said to be aspirated.

The '''QEM''' (Models and Methods of Quantitative Economics), also known as ''Erasmus Mundus QEM'', is an [[Erasmus Mundus]] post-graduate [[Master of Economics|Master's degree in Economics]]. The program combines "core economic theory with related quantitative disciplines such as Probability, Statistics, Econometrics, Finance, Actuarial Science, Mathematical Modelling, Computation and Simulation, Experimental Design, and Political Science."

It is offered by a [[consortium]] of four universities: [[Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne]] (co-ordinating institution), [[Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona]], [[Universität Bielefeld]], and the [[Università Ca' Foscari Venezia]] with a network of Associated Partners consisting of international academic institutions as well as public and private companies, as aside.

Related degrees include the [[EMLE]]-European Master in Law &amp; Economics and the [http://www.upcomillas.es/emin/ EMIN] - Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Economics and Management of Network Industries.

==Structure==
QEM students are required to study at two of the four participating universities of the Consortium. This [[academic mobility]] enables students to benefit from the diversity in strengths of each university on a wide range of issues, and to meet and work with professionals from various backgrounds. In particular, it provides the students the opportunity to learn and integrate with different European cultures.

Upon successfully completing the programme, students are awarded a QEM Joint Degree from the partners of the consortium. The QEM consortium provides  career assistance to the students, including help with internships and job placement for graduates. The language of instruction is English and the partner universities also provide European language courses for graduates.

==History and Governance==
The Erasmus Mundus QEM was the first [[European Joint Master degree in Economics]]; it was approved by the European Union in 2006.  The QEM is organised and managed by an executive committee, joint graduate committee, and an advisory board. The executive committee meets regularly to define QEM activities and improve on the intra-consortium mobility conditions suggested by [[EACEA]]. These QEM activities are then managed by the joint graduate committee. The advisory board is made up of  professional experts in the field of economics, including [[Nobel Prize]] winners [[Edward C. Prescott]], [[James Mirrlees]] and [[Reinhard Selten]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4267">'''Rational Choice Institutionalism''' ('''RCI''') is a theoretical approach to the study of institutions arguing that actors use [[institutions]] to maximize their utility. However, actors face rule-based constraints provided by the institutional environment which influence their behaviour. Rational Choice Institutionalism arose initially from the study of congressional behaviour in the U.S. in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, P. A., &amp; Taylor, R. (1996). Political Science and the Three Institutionalisms. Political Studies, 44, 936-957&lt;/ref&gt; It employs analytical tools borrowed from [[neo-classical economics]] to explain how institutions are created, the behaviour of political actors within it, and the outcome of strategic [[interaction]].

RCI explains the creation of institutions as an attempt to reduce [[transaction costs]] of collective activity which would be significantly higher without such institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver (1985) The Economic Institutions of Capitalism, New York, Free Press&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions persist after their creation because they reduce uncertainty and allow gains from exchange. Rational Choice Institutionalism assumes that political actors within the institutional setting have a fixed set of [[preferences]]. To maximize those preferences actors behave highly instrumental through systematic foresight and strategic cost-benefit calculation.&lt;ref&gt;Shepsle, K. (2005). Rational Choice Instituionalism. Havard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions lay down the 'rules of the game', define the range of available strategies and the sequence of alternatives. The actors' behaviour will be highly influenced by the expectation how other players will bargain. The institutional environment provides information and enforcement mechanism that reduce [[uncertainty]] for each actor about the corresponding behaviour of others.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, P. A., &amp; Taylor, R. (1996). Political Science and the Three Institutionalisms. Political Studies, 44, 936-957&lt;/ref&gt; This 'calculus approach' explains how the institutional setting influences individual behaviour and stresses how strategic interaction determines policy outcomes.

==The Principal-Agent Model==
A key concept of Rational Choice Institutionalism is the [[principal-agent]] model borrowed from Neo-classical economics. The concept assumes that the principal enters into a contractual relation with a second party, the agent, and delegates responsibility to the latter to fulfil certain responsibilities or a set of tasks on behalf of the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iim.uni-flensburg.de/vwl/upload/lehre/wise0607/eus/institutions_and_culture/Kassim_on_P-A_in_EU.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719103411/http://www.iim.uni-flensburg.de/vwl/upload/lehre/wise0607/eus/institutions_and_culture/Kassim_on_P-A_in_EU.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems occur due to an asymmetric distribution of information which favours the agent. The latter enables the agent to pursue its own interest and engage in opportunistic behaviour – shirking - at the cost of the principal’s interest.&lt;ref&gt;Kiewiet, D.R. and McCubbins, M.D. (1991) The Logic of Delegation: Congressional Parties and the Appropriations Process, Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal’s problem is how to control and limit shirking by the agent.

==Limitations==
Rational Choice Institutionalism is a [[deductive]] approach which relies on theoretical model building to explain real world policy outcomes. Therefore, due to its foundation on abstraction and clear lines of reasoning, it oversimplifies human motivation and interaction.

{{Forms of government}}
The '''rule according to a higher law''' means that no law may be enforced by the government unless it conforms with certain universal principles (written or unwritten) of fairness, morality, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;West's Encyclopedia of American Law (in 13 volumes), 2nd Ed., edited by Jeffrey Lehman and Shirelle Phelps. Publisher: Thomson Gale, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7876-6367-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''the rule according to a higher law'' may serve as a practical legal criterion to qualify the instances of political or economical decision-making, when a [[government]], even though acting in conformity with clearly defined and properly enacted legal [[Law|rules]], still produces results which many observers find unfair or unjust.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers|M.N.S. Sellers]], ''Republican Legal Theory: The History, Constitution and Purposes of Law in a Free State'', Basingstoke, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The idea of a law of ultimate justice over and above the momentary law of the state—a higher law—was first introduced into post-Roman Europe by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]] jurists.&lt;ref&gt;Wormser, ''The Story of the LAW'', pg. 189&lt;/ref&gt; "Higher law" can be interpreted in this context as the [[divine law|divine]] or [[natural law]] or basic legal values, established in the [[international law]] – the choice depending on the viewpoint. But this is definitely a Law above the law.&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Corwin, ''The “Higher Law” Background of American Constitutional Law'' (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; And it is in this capacity that it possesses the equal legal value for both the [[common law|common]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, as opposed to natural law which is largely associated with common law.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie F. Goldstein, ''Popular Sovereignty, the Origins of Judicial Review, and the Revival of Unwritten Law'', Journal of Politics 48 (1986): 51–71&lt;/ref&gt; "To recognize the necessary connection between the rule of law as an ideal and well-constructed constitutional government does not and should not be taken to imply that all states can or should maintain the same constitutional structures in practice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers]], ''An Introduction. The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, pp. 4–5. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The rule according to higher law'' is a practical approach to the implementation of the higher law theory which creates a bridge of mutual understanding (with regard to universal legal values) between the English language doctrine of the [[rule of law]], traditional for the countries of common law, and the originally German doctrine of ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'', translated into other languages of continental Europe as ''État de droit'' (Fr.), ''Estado de derecho'' (Sp.), ''Stato di diritto'' (It.), and ''Правовое государство'' (Ru.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75 Anniversary of the Roerich Pact, Grid Belgium, 2010]. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter doctrine is the product of continental European legal thought which had adopted it from German legal philosophy. Its name can be translated into English as "state of law" —meaning the state in which the exercise of governmental power is kept in check by the higher law rather than by the changeable law established by this state.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Amartya Sen]] mentioned that the legal theorists in ancient India used term of classical Sanskrit "nyāya" in the sense of not just a matter of judging institutions and rules, but of judging the societies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Amartya Sen, ''Global justice'' in ''Global Perspectives on the Rule of Law'', edited by [[James J. Heckman]], Robert L. Nelson, Lee Cabating and Paul Lepore, Routledge, London and New York, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Before the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], [[African American]]s were legally denied equal rights and freedoms pursuant to formally valid codes prescribing the relations between master and slave. Although these codes were ''de jure'' fully suitable for application in legal practice, their enforcement by the then U.S. government ''de facto'' violated basic human rights of a significant part of the population. [[William H. Seward]] famously proclaimed that slavery is forbidden under "a higher law than the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]."

Generally speaking, the occurrence of such "justly enacted unjust laws" fully depends on the stance taken by the country's political leadership towards [[the rule of law]] principle.

In some countries, the political leaders assert that the rule of law is purely a procedural concept. Therefore, they argue that any government may strip its subjects of their fundamental freedoms or infringe their vital interests so long as this is done by way of a duly implemented legal mechanism. For example, at the [[Nuremberg trials]], in an attempt to justify their crimes against Jewish and Romany population of Europe during [[World War II]], some of the former leaders of [[Nazi Germany]] argued that they had broken none of the laws effective when Hitler had been in power. It was only by invoking the rule according to a higher law that the Allied prosecutors were able to overcome such defenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/ha/ga_95-I/ga_95-I.html Introductory note by Antonio Cassese] for General Assembly resolution 95(I) of 11 December 1946 (Affirmation of the Principles of International Law recognized by the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal) on the website of the [https://www.un.org/law/avl/ UN Audiovisual Library of International Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, conversely, the political leaders assert that all written laws must be kept in line with the universal principles of morality, fairness, and justice. These leaders argue that, as a necessary corollary to the axiom that "no one is above the law," the rule of law requires the government to treat all persons equally under the law. However, the proclaimed right to equal treatment is susceptible to instantly becoming void each time the government denies a sufficient level of respect, dignity, and autonomy to a certain class of individuals or to human rights in general."&lt;ref&gt;Augusto Zimmermann, ''Constitutions Without Constitutionalism: The Failure of Constitutionalism in Brazil, The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, p.101. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the unwritten and universally self-explanatory principles of equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect are said to overrule conventional written laws enacted by the government. It is these principles that are often referred to as "natural law." They also constitute the basis of the "higher law theory".

==''Rechtsstaat''==
The ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' doctrine (legal state, state of right, constitutional state, constitutional government) was first introduced by the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in his latest works completed after the U.S. and French constitutions had been adopted in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=[[The Constitution of Liberty]]|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|date=1960|pages=196-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of country’s written [[constitution]] created using principles of the Higher Law. This supremacy meant creating guarantees for the implementation of his central idea: a permanently peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness and prosperity of the citizens. Kant was basing his doctrine exclusively on the idea of constitutionalism and constitutional government.

The Russian legal system, born in the 19th century as a result of the transformations initiated by the reforms of the [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]], was (and still is) based primarily upon the German legal tradition. It was from the latter that Russia had adopted the doctrine of ''Rechtsstaat'', which literally translates as "Legal State." Its closest English analogue is "the rule of law."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, ''Defining the rules'', ''The European Lawyer'', Issue 90, October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Legal state concept adopts the written constitution as the country's supreme law (the rule of constitution). It is a fundamental but undefined principle that appears in the very first dispositive provision of Russia’s post-Communist constitution: "The Russian Federation – Russia – constitutes a democratic federative legal state with a republican form of governance." Similarly, the very first dispositive provision of Ukraine’s Constitution declares that "Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state." Hence, the effort to invest meaning to the "Legal State" definition is anything but theoretical.

[[Valery Zorkin]], President of the Constitutional Court of Russia, wrote in 2003, "Becoming a legal state has long been our ultimate goal, and we have certainly made serious progress in this direction over the past several years. However, no one can say now that we have reached this destination. Such a legal state simply cannot exist without a lawful and just society. Here, as in no other sphere of our life, the state reflects the level of maturity reached by the society."&lt;ref&gt;''The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform'', edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian concept of Legal state has adopted many segments of [[constitutional economics]] which serves as a practical implementation of the higher law theory in economics.

Economist [[James M. Buchanan]] argues that, in the framework of constitutional government, any governmental intervention or regulation must be conditioned by the three following assumptions. First, every failure of the market economy to function smoothly and perfectly can be corrected by governmental intervention. Second, those holding political office and manning the bureaucracies are altruistic upholders of the public interest, unconcerned with their own personal economic well-being. And third, changing the government responsibilities towards more intervention and control will not profoundly and perversely affect the social and economic life.

Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the [[state (polity)|state]] as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members." This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics. A constitutional economics approach allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis, helping to avoid a one-dimensional understanding. Buchanan, together with Kant, believes that a [[constitution]] in its capacity as the Higher Law, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions, while balancing interests of the state and society against those of individuals, with their constitutional rights to personal freedom and private happiness.

Buchanan also outlines importance of protection of the moral principles underlying constitutional norms. He writes that "the ethics of constitutional citizenship is not directly comparable to ethical behavior in interaction with other persons within the constraints imposed by the rules of an existing regime. An individual may be fully responsible, in the standard ethical sense, and yet fail to meet the ethical requirement of constitutional citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J., ''Logical Formulations of Constitutional Liberty'', Vol. 1., Indianapolis, 1999. P. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4737">'''Sage writing''' was a [[genre]] of [[creative nonfiction]] popular in the [[Victorian era]]. The concept originates with John Holloway's 1953 book ''The Victorian Sage: Studies in Argument.''

Sage writing is a development from ancient [[wisdom literature]] in which the writer chastises and instructs the reader about contemporary social issues, often utilizing discourses of [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[politics]], and [[economics]] in non-technical ways. Prominent examples of the genre include writings by [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[John Ruskin]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Some 20th-century writers, such as [[Joan Didion]] and [[New Journalism|New Journalists]] such as [[Norman Mailer]] and [[Tom Wolfe]], have also been identified as sage writers.

==Characteristic traits==
Holloway constructed the concept as a means to rediscover the value of Victorian writers who had been denigrated by Modernists for their prolixity and moralizing. He wrote "No one, of course, is suggesting that Victorian 'prophetic' literature is an all-sufficing treasury of forgotten wisdom. But by now we can see that the Victorian prophets deserve not embarrassed disregard but respect and thoughtful attention."&lt;ref name = "holl"&gt;Holloway, John. ''The Victorian Sage: Studies in Argument.'' London: Macmillan, 1953, p. 2; p22&lt;/ref&gt;

Holloway identified Thomas Carlyle as the originator of the genre, but traced its origins back to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. He argued that Carlyle "wants to state, and to clinch, the basic tenets of a 'Life-Philosophy', of something that will veritably transform men's outlook".&lt;ref name = "holl"/&gt; Carlyle established a model whereby the writer makes non-logical arguments about contemporary social issues, drawing from various forms of modern knowledge and traditional wisdom.

According to [[George Landow (professor)|George Landow]], who developed Holloway's model, sage writing can be distinguished from traditional [[wisdom literature]] in that "Whereas the pronouncements of traditional wisdom literature always take as their point of departure the assumption that they embody the accepted, [[received wisdom]] of an entire society, the pronouncements of the biblical prophet and Victorian sage begin with the assumption that, however traditional their messages may once have been, they are now forgotten or actively opposed by society."&lt;ref&gt;Landow, "The Sage versus the Wisdom Speaker."&lt;/ref&gt; The sage borrows from the [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s what Landow identifies as a four-part strategy of "interpretation, attack upon the audience (or those in authority), warning, and visionary promise."&lt;ref&gt;Landow, "The Prophet's Four-Part Pattern."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Sage writing is a development of [[wisdom literature]] drawing much of its energy from the style of [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s such as [[Jeremiah]] and [[Isaiah]]; notably, sage writer [[Matthew Arnold]] was once referred to as an "Elegant [[Jeremiah]]".&lt;ref&gt;Landow, "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; Landow also lists [[sermon]] writing, [[satire]], and British and [[German Romanticism|German]] [[Romantic poetry]] as formative influences.

==Major Sage Texts==
* [[Thomas Carlyle]] - "Signs of the Times" (1829); ''[[Past and Present (book)|Past and Present]]'' (1843); ''[[Latter-Day Pamphlets]]'' (1850)
* [[Matthew Arnold]] - ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' (1869)
* [[John Ruskin]] - ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' (1851-3); ''[[Unto this Last]]'' (1860)
* [[Henry David Thoreau]] -  ''[[Life Without Principle]]''; (1854); ''[[Slavery in Massachusetts]]'' (1854); ''[[A Plea for Captain John Brown]]'' (1859)
* [[Norman Mailer]] - ''[[The Armies of the Night]]'' (1968) {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4051">'''Sandra Risa Leiblum''' (1943–2010) was an American author, lecturer, and researcher in [[sexology]].

==Biography==
Leiblum was born in [[Brooklyn, NY]], earned her B.A. from [[Brooklyn College]] and graduated with a Ph.D. in [[psychology]] from the [[University of Illinois]], [[Urbana-Champaign]], Illinois. She completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the  [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] Medical Center, Denver, Colorado.  In 1972 she joined the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry of UMDNJ, [[Robert Wood Johnson Medical School]]. During her career she studied sexual issues in many circumstances addressing among others  [[transgender]] situations, [[infertility]], and [[menopause]]. She was on the editorial board of the ''[[Journal of Sex Education and Therapy]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Gay and Lesbian Social Services]]''.  Among the honors she received were the ''Masters and Johnson Lifetime Achievement Award'' (awarded by the Society for Sex Therapy and Research in 2001) and the ''Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award'' (awarded by the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex for distinguished contributions to sexuality research over a lifetime in 2003). She was the first president the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health in 2000 and a past president of the Society for Sex Therapy and Research, as well as a Fellow of the [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]].

In 2001, Leiblum described the [[Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder]] as a new syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Leiblum | first1 = SR | last2 = Nathan | first2 = S |title=Persistent sexual arousal syndrome: a newly discovered pattern of female sexuality| journal=[[J Sex Marital Ther]]| year = 2001 | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 365–380 | doi=10.1080/009262301317081115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sarajevo Music Academy''' or '''Music Academy | University of Sarajevo'''({{lang-bs|Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu}} or '''MAS''') is a [[Faculty of Music]] of [[University of Sarajevo]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unsa.ba/en/org-jedinica/music-academy&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Sarajevo Music  Academy  was founded by the Decision of the National Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina on May 20, 1955 as the fourth such higher education institution in the former joint state, and the first established after the  [[World War II]]. This Decision was published in the official Gazette of the [[People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] No. 12/55, on June 8, 1955. The establishment of the Sarajevo Music  Academy preceded a number of favorable prerequisites, such as the establishment of a network of music schools, the founding of the [[Sarajevo National Theater]], Sarajevo Opera House, Symphony Orchestra RTV Sarajevo, the Institute for the study of folklore and the continuity of the [[Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra]].
At the founding of the Academy, the founders of this institution were:
*Milenko Živković, rector of the Academy of Music in Belgrade
*Dr. [[Dragotin Cvetko]], professor of the [[Academy of Music (Ljubljana)]]
*[[Natko Devčić]], professor at the [[Academy of Music, University of Zagreb]]
*Cvjetko Rihtman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proleksis.lzmk.hr/43975/|title=Rihtman, Cvjetko - Proleksis enciklopedija|website=proleksis.lzmk.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; director of the Folklore Research Institute in Sarajevo
*Miroslav Špiler,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=59839|title=Špiler, Miroslav - Hrvatska enciklopedija|website=www.enciklopedija.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; professor of the Higher Pedagogical Academy in Sarajevo
*Strahinja Dramušić, in front of the Council for Education, Science and Culture of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a scorer
After the formation of the first pedagogical core at the Sarajevo Music Academy the first Rector was elected, prof. Cvetko Rihtman. In the first year of the Academy's work, 42 students were enrolled. Teaching at the Sarajevo Music Academy began on 19 December 1955 in seven sections:

*I   -  Department of Composition and Conducting
*II  -  Department of solo singing
*III -  Department of Piano 
*IV  -  Department of string Instruments
*V   -  Department of wind instruments
*VI  -  Department of Musicology
*VII -  Theoretical-pedagogical section

The fateful and tragic events that affected the former joint state in the nineties, made the Academy without a large number of teachers and associates, and the building was badly damaged on six occasions. One of the "holes" in the wall between the concert hall and the hallway, was inscribed and preserved the Academy's management, as a symbol of these difficult times. A large number of students left Sarajevo. Out of 45 permanently hired teachers and assistants at the Academy, only fifteen remained. The Academy has lost two-thirds of the collective. The only staff were teachers from other institutions that had been hired from time to time, and the number of students was about 50. Difficulties were  also reflected in the organization of the teaching itself and in the absence of a functional work space.
In spite of all that, the training was interrupted only once for a short time, in May 1995, due to a more intensive bombing. Teachers of the instrumental sections often held classes in their own apartments due to the unsuccessful working space, but also the safety. Regardless of the difficult circumstances of life and work, the rest of the Academy has preserved human and professional enthusiasm. Apart from the efforts to preserve the teaching process, the Academy's teachers played a major role in establishing the Orchestra of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, restarting the work of the Sarajevo Philharmonic, and the academic choir "Gaudeamus". Thanks to efforts from then dean, Osman-Faruk Sijarić&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/movies/stunned-by-war-the-arts-of-sarajevo-are-reawakening.html&lt;/ref&gt;, significant support and assistance from music academies and conservatories from Vienna, Bern, Graz, Karlsruhe, Madrid, Stockholm, was given and the Sarajevo Music Academy was registered unanonimuosly in the membership of the European Association of Music Conservatories and Academies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec-music.eu/members/our-members|title=Our Members|website=AEC|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[European Association of Conservatoires]]). In the war period, 15 students graduated ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]), 2 graduated ([[Master of Arts|MA]]) and one doctorate ([[PhD]]) was defended at the Academy. With huge difficulty, the Academy accomplished its basic function for almost the last decade of the 20th century.

In more than 62 years of existence and work of the Academy, there graduated over 2500 students, mastered them around 200, and about 24 doctorates were defended. About 300 teachers and associates were taking care about everything. Regardless of the great political, social and any other turbulence that strongly influenced all aspects of existence and work, the Academy had an upward developmental line. Today it is an internationally recognizable artistic and educational institution with developed departments, academic degrees, expressed artistic and scientific activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.unsa.ba/historijat|title=Historijat - Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu|website=www.mas.unsa.ba|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6273">In [[epidemiology]], the '''standardized mortality ratio''' or '''SMR''', is a quantity, expressed as either a ratio or percentage quantifying the increase or decrease in [[Mortality rate|mortality]] of a study cohort with respect to the general population.&lt;ref name="Everitt2010"/&gt;

==Standardized mortality ratio==
The standardized mortality ratio is the ratio of observed deaths in the study group to expected deaths in the general population.&lt;ref name="Broeck2013" /&gt; This ratio can be expressed as a percentage simply by multiplying by 100.

The SMR may be quoted as either a [[ratio]] or a [[percentage]]. If the SMR is quoted as a ratio and is equal to 1.0, then this means the number of observed deaths equals that of expected cases. If higher than 1.0, then there is a higher number of deaths than is expected. SMR constitutes an indirect form of standardization. It has an advantage over the direct method of standardization since age-adjustment is permitted in situations where age stratification may not be available for the cohort being studied or where strata-specific data are subject to excessive [[random variable|random variability]].

===Definition===
The requirements for calculating SMR for a cohort are:
*The number of persons in each age group in the population being studied
*The age specific death rates of the general population in the same age groups of the study population
*The observed deaths in the study population

Expected deaths would then be calculated simply by multiplying the death rates of the general population by the total number of participants in the study group at the corresponding age group and summing up all the values for each age group to arrive at the number of expected deaths. The study groups are weighted based on their particular distribution (for example, age), as opposed to the general populations's distribution. This is a fundamental distinction between an indirect method of standardization like SMR from direct standardization techniques.

The SMR may well be quoted with an indication of the [[uncertainty]] associated with its estimation, such as a [[confidence interval]] (CI) or [[p value]], which allows it to be interpreted in terms of [[statistical significance]].

===Example===
An example might be a [[cohort study]] into [[cumulative exposure]] to [[arsenic]] from [[drinking water]], whereby the mortality rates due to a number of [[cancer]]s in a highly exposed group (which drinks water with a mean arsenic concentration of, say 10&amp;nbsp;mg) is compared with those in the general population. An SMR for [[bladder cancer]] of 1.70 in the exposed group would mean that there is 70% more cases of death due to bladder cancer in the cohort than in the reference population (in this case the national population, which is generally considered not to exhibit cumulative exposure to high arsenic levels).

==Standardized mortality rate==
''Standardized mortality rate'' tells how many persons, per thousand of the population, will die in a given year and what the causes of death will be.  

Such statistics have many uses:
* [[Life insurance]] companies periodically update their premiums based on the [[mortality rate]], adjusted for age.  
* Medical researchers can track disease-related deaths and shift focus and funding to address increasing or decreasing risks.
* Organizations, both non- and for-profit, can utilize such statistics to justify their missions.
* Regarding occupational uses:
Mortality tables are also often used when numbers of deaths for each age-specific stratum are not available. It is also used to study mortality rate in an occupationally exposed population: Do people who work in a certain industry, such as mining or construction, have a higher mortality than people of the same age in the general population? Is an additional risk associated with that occupation? To answer the question of whether a population of miners has a higher mortality than we would expect in a similar population that is not engaged in mining, the age-specific rates for such a known population, such as all men of the same age, are applied to each age group in the population of interest. This will yield the number of deaths expected in each age group in the population of interest, if this population had had the mortality experience of the known population. Thus, for each age group, the number of deaths expected is calculated, and these numbers are totaled. The numbers of deaths that were actually observed in that population are also calculated and totaled. The ratio of the total number of deaths actually observed to the total number of deaths expected, if the population of interest had had the mortality experience of the known population, is then calculated. This ratio is called the standardized mortality ratio (SMR). The SMR is defined as follows: SMR = (Observed no. of deaths per year)/(Expected no. of deaths per year).

'''Surface science''' is the study of [[physics|physical]] and [[chemistry|chemical]] phenomena that occur at the [[interface (chemistry)|interface]] of two [[phase (matter)|phases]], including [[solid]]–[[liquid]] interfaces, solid–[[gas]] interfaces, solid–[[vacuum]] interfaces, and [[liquid]]–[[gas]] interfaces. It includes the fields of ''[[surface chemistry]]'' and ''[[surface physics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Prutton | first=Martin | title=Introduction to Surface Physics
| publisher=Oxford University Press | date=1994 | isbn=978-0-19-853476-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some related practical applications are classed as [[surface engineering]]. The science encompasses concepts such as [[heterogeneous catalysis]], [[semiconductor device fabrication]], [[fuel cell]]s, [[self-assembled monolayer]]s, and [[adhesive]]s. Surface science is closely related to [[interface and colloid science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Luklema | first=J. | title=Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science | publisher=Academic Press | date=1995–2005 | volume=1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interfacial chemistry and physics are common subjects for both. The methods are different. In addition, interface and colloid science studies [[macroscopic]] [[phenomena]] that occur in [[heterogeneous]] systems due to peculiarities of interfaces.

==History==
The field of surface chemistry started with [[heterogeneous catalysis]] pioneered by [[Paul Sabatier (chemist)|Paul Sabatier]] on [[hydrogenation]] and [[Fritz Haber]] on the [[Haber process]].&lt;ref name=Nobel&gt;{{cite web | last=Wennerström | first=Håkan |author2=Lidin, Sven  | title=''Scientific Background on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2007 Chemical Processes on Solid Surfaces''  | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2007/advanced-chemistryprize2007.pdf | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irving Langmuir]] was also one of the founders of this field, and the scientific journal on surface science, ''[[Langmuir (journal)|Langmuir]]'', bears his name. The [[Langmuir equation|Langmuir adsorption equation]] is used to model monolayer adsorption where all surface adsorption sites have the same affinity for the adsorbing species. [[Gerhard Ertl]] in 1974 described for the first time the adsorption of [[hydrogen]] on a [[palladium]] surface using a novel technique called [[Low-energy electron diffraction|LEED]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Conrad | first=H. | author2=Ertl, G. | author2-link=Gerhard Ertl | author3=Latta, E.E. | title=Adsorption of hydrogen on palladium single crystal surfaces | journal=Surface Science | volume=41 | issue=2 | pages=435–446 | date=February 1974 | doi=10.1016/0039-6028(74)90060-0 |bibcode = 1974SurSc..41..435C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar studies with [[platinum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Christmann | first=K. | author2=Ertl, G. | author2-link=Gerhard Ertl | author3=Pignet, T. | title=Adsorption of hydrogen on a Pt(111) surface | journal=Surface Science | volume=54 | issue=2 | pages=365–392 | date=February 1976 | doi=10.1016/0039-6028(76)90232-6|bibcode = 1976SurSc..54..365C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[nickel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Christmann | first=K. | author2=Schober, O. | author3=Ertl, G. | author3-link=Gerhard Ertl | author4=Neumann, M. | title=Adsorption of hydrogen on nickel single crystal surfaces | journal=[[The Journal of Chemical Physics]] | volume=60 | issue=11 | pages=4528–4540  | date=June 1, 1974 | doi=10.1063/1.1680935|bibcode = 1974JChPh..60.4528C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Christmann | first=K. | author2=Behm, R.

Most recent developments in surface sciences include the 2007 [[Nobel prize of Chemistry]] winner [[Gerhard Ertl]]'s advancements in surface chemistry, specifically
his investigation of the interaction between carbon monoxide molecules and platinum surfaces.

==Surface chemistry==
Surface chemistry can be roughly defined as the study of chemical reactions at interfaces.  It  is closely related to [[surface engineering]], which aims at modifying the chemical composition of a surface by incorporation of selected elements or [[Functional group|functional groups]] that produce various desired effects or improvements in the properties of the surface or interface. Surface science is of particular importance to the fields of [[heterogeneous catalysis]], [[electrochemistry]], and [[geochemistry]].

===Catalysis===
The adhesion of gas or liquid molecules to the surface is known as [[adsorption]]. This can be due to either [[chemisorption]] or [[physisorption]], and the strength of molecular adsorption to a catalyst surface is critically important to the catalyst's performance (see [[Sabatier principle]]). However, it is difficult to study these phenomena in real catalyst particles, which have complex structures. Instead, well-defined [[single crystal]] surfaces of catalytically active materials such as [[platinum]] are often used as model catalysts. Multi-component materials systems are used to study interactions between catalytically active metal particles and supporting oxides; these are produced by growing ultra-thin films or particles on a single crystal surface.&lt;ref&gt;J.-H. Fischer-Wolfarth, J.A. Farmer, J.M. Flores-Camacho, A. Genest, I.V. Yudanov, N. Rösch, C.T. Campbell, S. Schauermann, H.-J. Freund, "Particle-size dependent heats of adsorption of CO on supported Pd nanoparticles as measured with a single-crystal microcalorimeter", [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.81.241416 ''Phys. Rev. B'' '''81''' (2010) 241416]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships between the composition, structure, and chemical behavior of these surfaces are studied using [[ultra-high vacuum]] techniques, including adsorption and [[Thermal desorption spectroscopy|temperature-programmed desorption]] of molecules, [[scanning tunneling microscopy]], [[low energy electron diffraction]], and [[Auger electron spectroscopy]]. Results can be fed into chemical models or used toward the [[rational design]] of new catalysts. Reaction mechanisms can also be clarified due to the atomic-scale precision of surface science measurements.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lewandoski, I.M.N. Groot, S. Shaikhutdinov, H.-J. Freund, "Scanning tunneling microscopy evidence for the Mars-van Krevelen type mechanism of low temperature CO oxidation on an FeO(1 1 1) film on Pt(1 1 1)", [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2011.08.033 ''Catalysis Today'' '''181''' (2012) p. 52-55]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrochemistry===
Electrochemistry is the study of processes driven through an applied potential at a solid-liquid or liquid-liquid interface. The behavior of an electrode-electrolyte interface is affected by the distribution of ions in the liquid phase next to the interface forming the [[electrical double layer]]. Adsorption and desorption events can be studied at atomically flat single crystal surfaces as a function of applied potential, time, and solution conditions using [[scanning probe microscopy|spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy]]&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Gewirth, B.K. Niece, "Electrochemical applications of ''in Situ'' Scanning Probe Microscopy", [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr960067y?journalCode=chreay ''Chem. Rev.'' '''97''' (1997) p. 1129-1162]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[X-ray crystal truncation rod|surface X-ray scattering]].&lt;ref&gt;Z. Nagy, H. You, "Applications of surface X-ray scattering to electrochemistry problems", [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0013-4686(02)00223-2 ''Electrochimica Acta'' '''47''' (2002) p. 3037-3055]&lt;/ref&gt; These studies link traditional electrochemical techniques such as [[cyclic voltammetry]] to direct observations of interfacial processes.

===Geochemistry===
Geologic phenomena such as [[Iron cycle|iron cycling]] and [[soil contamination]] are controlled by the interfaces between [[minerals]] and their environment. The atomic-scale structure and chemical properties of mineral-solution interfaces are studied using ''in situ'' [[Synchrotron light source|synchrotron]] X-ray techniques such as [[X-ray reflectivity]], [[X-ray standing waves]], and [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy]] as well as scanning probe microscopy. For example, studies of [[Toxic heavy metal|heavy metal]] or [[actinide]] adsorption onto mineral surfaces reveal molecular-scale details of adsorption, enabling more accurate predictions of how these contaminants travel through soils&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Catalano, C. Park, P. Fenter, Z. Zhang, "Simultaneous inner- and outer-sphere arsenate adsorption on corundum and hematite", [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2008.02.013 ''Geochim. et Cosmochim. Acta'' '''72''' (2008) p. 1986-2004]&lt;/ref&gt; or disrupt natural dissolution-precipitation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;M. Xu, L. Kovarik, B.W. Arey, A.R. Felmy, K.M. Rosso, S. Kerisit, "Kinetics and mechanisms of cadmium carbonate heteroepitaxial growth at the calcite (10-14) surface", [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2013.11.036 ''Geochim. et Cosmochim. Acta'' '''134''' (2014) p. 221-233]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surface physics==
Surface physics can be roughly defined as the study of physical interactions that occur at interfaces.  It overlaps with surface chemistry. Some of the things investigated by surface physics include [[friction]], [[surface states]], [[surface diffusion]], [[surface reconstruction]], surface [[phonons]] and [[plasmons]], [[epitaxy]] and [[Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy|surface enhanced Raman scattering]], the emission and [[Quantum tunneling|tunneling]] of electrons, [[spintronics]], and the self-assembly of [[nanostructure]]s on surfaces. In a [[confined liquid]], defined by geometric constraints on a nanoscopic scale, most molecules sense some surface effects, which can result in physical properties grossly deviating from those of the bulk liquid.

==Analysis techniques==
The study and analysis of surfaces involves both physical and chemical analysis techniques.

Several modern methods probe the topmost 1–10&amp;nbsp;nm of [[Interface (matter)|surface]]s exposed to vacuum.  These include [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]], [[Auger electron spectroscopy]], [[low-energy electron diffraction]], [[electron energy loss spectroscopy]], [[thermal desorption spectroscopy]], [[ion scattering spectroscopy]], [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]], [[dual polarization interferometry]], and other surface analysis methods included in the [[list of materials analysis methods]]. Many of these techniques require vacuum as they rely on the detection of electrons or ions emitted from the surface under study. Moreover, in general [[ultra high vacuum]], in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] pressure or better, it is necessary to reduce surface contamination by residual gas, by reducing the number of molecules reaching the sample over a given time period. At 0.1 mPa (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; torr) partial pressure of a contaminant and [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure | standard temperature]], it only takes on the order of 1 second to cover a surface with a one-to-one monolayer of contaminant to surface atoms, so much lower pressures are needed for measurements. This is found by an order of magnitude estimate for the (number) [[Specific surface area | specific surface area]] of materials and the impingement rate formula from the [[Kinetic theory of gases | kinetic theory of gases]].

Purely optical techniques can be used to study interfaces under a wide variety of conditions.  Reflection-absorption infrared, dual polarisation interferometry, [[Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy|surface enhanced Raman]] and [[sum frequency generation]] spectroscopies can be used to probe solid–vacuum as well as solid–gas, solid–liquid, and liquid–gas surfaces. [[Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance]] works in solid-gas, solid-liquid, liquid-gas surfaces and can detect even sub-nanometer layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jussila|first1=Henri|last2=Yang|first2=He|last3=Granqvist|first3=Niko|last4=Sun|first4=Zhipei|title=Surface plasmon resonance for characterization of large-area atomic-layer graphene film|journal=Optica|date=5 February 2016|volume=3|issue=2|pages=151|doi=10.1364/OPTICA.3.000151}}&lt;/ref&gt; It probes the interaction kinetics as well as dynamic structural changes such as liposome collapse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Granqvist|first1=Niko|last2=Yliperttula|first2=Marjo|last3=Välimäki|first3=Salla|last4=Pulkkinen|first4=Petri|last5=Tenhu|first5=Heikki|last6=Viitala|first6=Tapani|title=Control of the Morphology of Lipid Layers by Substrate Surface Chemistry|journal=Langmuir|date=18 March 2014|volume=30|issue=10|pages=2799–2809|doi=10.1021/la4046622|pmid=24564782}}&lt;/ref&gt; or swelling of layers in different pH. Dual Polarization Interferometry is used to quantify the order and disruption in birefringent thin films.&lt;ref&gt;

 |pmid=18422336
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been used, for example, to study the formation of lipid bilayers and their interaction with membrane proteins.

X-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques are also used to characterize surfaces and interfaces. While some of these measurements can be performed using [[X-ray tube|laboratory X-ray sources]], many require the high intensity and energy tunability of [[synchrotron radiation]]. [[X-ray crystal truncation rod]]s (CTR) and [[X-ray standing waves|X-ray standing wave]] (XSW) measurements probe changes in surface and [[Adsorption|adsorbate]] structures with sub-Ångström resolution. [[Surface-extended X-ray absorption fine structure]] (SEXAFS) measurements reveal the coordination structure and chemical state of adsorbates. [[Grazing-incidence small-angle scattering|Grazing-incidence small angle X-ray scattering]] (GISAXS) yields the size, shape, and orientation of [[nanoparticles]] on surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Renaud, G.; Lazzari, R.; Leroy, F. (2009). "Probing surface and interface morphology with Grazing Incidence Small Angle X-Ray Scattering", [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.surfrep.2009.07.002 ''Surf. Sci. Rep.'' '''64''' p. 255-380]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crystal structure]] and [[Texture (crystalline)|texture]] of thin films can be investigated using [[Grazing incidence diffraction|grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction]] (GIXD, GIXRD).

[[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS) is a standard tool for measuring the chemical states of surface species and for detecting the presence of surface contamination. Surface sensitivity is achieved by detecting [[photoelectrons]] with kinetic energies of about 10-1000 [[Electronvolt|eV]], which have corresponding [[inelastic mean free path]]s of only a few nanometers. This technique has been extended to operate at near-ambient pressures (ambient pressure XPS, AP-XPS) to probe more realistic gas-solid and liquid-solid interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Bluhm, H.; Hävecker, M.; Knop-Gericke, A.; Kiskinova, M.; Schlögl, R.; Salmeron, M. (2007). "''In Situ'' X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Studies of Gas-Solid Interfaces at Near-Ambient Conditions", [https://dx.doi.org/10.1557/mrs2007.211 ''MRS Bulletin'' '''32''' p. 1022-1030.]&lt;/ref&gt; Performing XPS with hard X-rays at synchrotron light sources yields photoelectrons with kinetic energies of several keV (hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, HAXPES), enabling access to chemical information from buried interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Sing, M. ''et al.''. "Profiling the Interface Electron Gas of LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; / SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Heterostructures with Hard X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy", [https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.176805 ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' '''102''' 176805.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern physical analysis methods include [[scanning tunneling microscope|scanning-tunneling microscopy]] (STM) and a family of methods descended from it, including [[atomic force microscopy]]. These microscopies have considerably increased the ability and desire of surface scientists to measure the physical structure of many  surfaces. For example, they make it possible to follow reactions at the solid–gas interface in real space, if those proceed on a time scale accessible by the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wintterlin | first1 = J. | last2 = Völkening | first2 = S. | last3 = Janssens | first3 = T.

'''Convergence''' is a phenomenon in telecommunication and media industry to integrate services, content offerings, and means of communication under one core technology or ecosystem. It includes cultural, society, business, service, technology, regulatory, and content aspects that need to be considered.

It’s practical application manifests in various concrete examples, as e.g. Internet, digital convergence, media convergence, home applications, and telecommunication. This article describes a wide are of aspects of convergence, with illustrations of convergent merging technologies (NBIC, nano-, bio-, info- and cognitive technologies) and convergence of media technology.

==Definitions==
"'''''Convergence''' is a deep integration of knowledge, tools, and all relevant activities of human activity for a common goal, to allow society to answer new questions to change the respective physical or social ecosystem. Such changes in the respective ecosystem open new trends, pathways, and opportunities in the following divergent phase of the process''" (Roco 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roco | first1 = MC | year = 2002 | title = 'Coherence and divergence of megatrends in science and engineering | url =https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1020157027792 | journal = J Nanopart Res | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 9–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bainbridge and Roco 2016 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bainbridge | first1 = W.S. | last2 = Roco | first2 = M.C. | year = 2016 | title = 'Science and technology convergence: with emphasis for nanotechnology-inspired convergence | url = | journal = J. Nanoparticle Res. | volume = 18 | issue = | page = 211 | doi=10.1007/s11051-016-3520-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[File:Leatherman-Charge-XTi.jpg|thumb|A converged mechanical tool, the multitool. Within one device, it provides many tools.]]
Siddhartha Menon defines convergence, in his ''Policy initiative Dilemmas on Media Covergence: A Cross National Perspective'', as integration and digitalization. Integration, here, is defined as "a process of transformation measure by the degree to which diverse media such as phone, data broadcast and information technology infrastructures are combined into a single seamless all purpose network architecture platform".&lt;ref&gt;Siddhartha, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Digitalization is not so much defined by its physical infrastructure, but by the content or the medium. [[Jan van Dijk]] suggests that "digitalization means breaking down signals into bytes consisting of ones and zeros".&lt;ref&gt;Van Dijk, J. (1999). The network society. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menon, Siddhartha. "Policy Initiative Dilemmas On Media Convergence: A Cross National Perspective." Conference Papers – International Communication Association (2006): 1–35. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. Web. 20 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Convergence is defined by Blackman, 1998, as a trend in the evolution of technology services and industry structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blackman | first1 = C | year = 1998 | title = Convergence between telecommunications and other media: how should regulation adapt? | url = | journal = Telecommunication Policy | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 163–170 | doi=10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convergence is later defined more specifically as the coming together of telecommunications, computing and broadcasting into a single digital bit-stream.&lt;ref&gt;Collin, 1998; Gates, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conlins | first1 = R | year = 1998 | title = Back to the future: Digital Television and Convergence in the United Kingdom | url = | journal = Telecommunication Policy | volume = 22 | issue = 4–5| pages = 383–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gate | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Convergence and competition: Technological change, industry concentration and competition policy in the telecommunications sector | url = | journal = University of Toronto Faculty of Law Review | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 83–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mueller stands against the statement that convergence is really a takeover of all forms of media by one technology: digital computers.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mueller | first1 = M | year = 1999 | title = Digital Convergence and its consequences | url = | journal = Javnost/The Public | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 11–27 | doi=10.1080/13183222.1999.11008716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media technological convergence''' is the tendency that as [[technological change|technology changes]], different technological system sometimes evolve toward performing similar tasks. Digital convergence refers to the convergence of four industries into one conglomerate, ITTCE ([[IT industry|Information Technologies]], [[telecommunication industry|Telecommunication]], [[Consumer Electronics]], and  [[Entertainment industry|Entertainment]]). Previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications), and video can now share resources and interact with each other synergistically. Telecommunications convergence (also called "network convergence") describes emerging [[telecommunications]] technologies, and [[network architecture]] used to migrate multiple communications services into a single network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworkingchannel.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid100_gci1310061,00.html|title=What is network convergence? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=SearchITChannel|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically this involves the converging of previously distinct media such as [[telephony]] and [[data communications]] into common interfaces on single devices, such as most smart phones can make phone calls and search the web.

'''Media convergence''' is the interlinking of computing and other information technologies, media content, media companies and communication networks that have arisen as the result of the evolution and popularization of the Internet as well as the activities, products and services that have emerged in the digital media space. Closely linked to the multilevel process of media convergence are also several developments in different areas of the media and communication sector which are also summarized under the term of [[media deconvergence]]. Many experts{{who|date=May 2013}} view this as simply being the tip of the iceberg, as all facets of institutional activity and social life such as business, government, art, journalism, health, and education are increasingly being carried out in these digital media spaces across a growing network of [[information and communication technology]] devices. Also included in this topic is the basis of computer networks, wherein many different operating systems are able to communicate via different [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]]. 
Convergent services, such as [[VoIP]], [[IPTV]], [[Smart TV]], and others, tend to replace the older technologies and thus can [[disruptive innovation|disrupt markets]]. IP-based convergence is inevitable and will result in new service and new demand in the market.&lt;ref name = "Shin"&gt;Shin, Dong Hee, Won – Yong Kim, and Dong-Hoon Lee.

Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. EBSCO. Web. 26 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; When the old technology converges into the public-owned common, IP based services become access-independent or less dependent. The old service is access-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Grieve, W. and Levin, S. (2005). From Clones To Packets: The Development Of Competition In Local Residential Telecommunications.

== History of media technological convergence ==

Communication networks were designed to carry different types of information independently. The older media, such as television and radio, are broadcasting networks with passive audiences. Convergence of telecommunication technology permits the manipulation of all forms of information, voice, data, and video.  Telecommunication has changed from a world of scarcity to one of seemingly limitless capacity. Consequently, the possibility of audience interactivity morphs the passive audience into an engaged audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackman|first=Colin|journal=Telecommunication Policy|title=Convergence between telecommunications and other media|year=1998|volume=22|issue=Elsevier Science Ltd.|pages=163–170|doi=10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical roots of convergence can be traced back to the emergence of [[mobile telephony]] and the [[Internet]], although the term properly applies only from the point in marketing history when fixed and mobile telephony began to be offered by operators as joined products. Fixed and mobile operators were, for most of the 1990s, independent companies. Even when the same organization marketed both products, these were sold and serviced independently.

In the 1990s an implicit and often explicit assumption was that new media was going to replace the old media and Internet was going to replace broadcasting. In Nicholas Negroponte's ''[[Being Digital]]'', Negroponte predicts the collapse of broadcast networks in favor of an era of narrow-casting. He also suggests that no government regulation can shatter the [[media conglomerate]]. "The monolithic empires of mass media are dissolving into an array of cottage industries... Media barons of today will be grasping to hold onto their centralized empires tomorrow.... The combined forces of technology and human nature will ultimately take a stronger hand in plurality than any laws Congress can invent."&lt;ref&gt;Negroponte, Nicholas. ''Being Digital''. Knopf, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The new media companies claimed that the old media would be absorbed fully and completely into the orbit of the emerging technologies.
[[George Gilder]] dismisses such claims saying,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} "The computer industry is converging with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with the horse, the TV converged with the nickelodeon, the word-processing program converged with the typewriter, the CAD program converged with the drafting board, and digital desktop publishing converged with the Linotype machine and the letterpress." Gilder believes that computers had come not to transform mass culture but to destroy it.

Media companies put Media Convergence back to their agenda, after the [[dot-com bubble]] burst. Erstwhile Knight Ridder promulgated concept of portable magazines, newspaper, and books in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Smith, G. |title=Back to the Future: The Tablet computer that looks just like an iPad... but it is 17 Years Old |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1381528/Knight-Ridder-tablet-looks-just-like-iPad-17-YEARS-OLD.html |publisher=MailOnline |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;"Within news corporations it became increasingly obvious that an editorial model based on mere replication in the internet of contents that had previously been written for print newspapers, radio, or television was no longer sufficient."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ramón Salaverria, Media Convergence|url = https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&amp;year=2008|website = online.journalism.utexas.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120215558/https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&amp;year=2008|archive-date = 2015-11-20|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of digital communication in the late 20th century has made it possible for media organizations (or individuals) to deliver text, audio, and video material over the same wired, wireless, or fiber-optic connections. At the same time, it inspired some media organizations to explore multimedia delivery of information. This digital convergence of news media, in particular, was called "Mediamorphosis" by researcher Roger Fidler [https://web.archive.org/web/20090315053135/http://rji.missouri.edu/staff-and-advisers/roger-fidler.php], in his 1997 book by that name. Today, we are surrounded by a multi-level convergent media world where all modes of communication and information are continually reforming to adapt to the enduring demands of technologies, "changing the way we create, consume, learn and interact with each other".&lt;ref&gt;(Jenkins, Henry (2006) Convergence Culture, New York University Press, New York.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Converging technological fields ==

'''NBIC''', an acronym for [[Nanotechnology|'''N'''anotechnology]], [[Biotechnology|'''B'''iotechnology]], [[Information technology|'''I'''nformation technology]] and [[Cognitive science|'''C'''ognitive science]], was, in 2014,  the most popular term for converging technologies. It was introduced into public discourse through the publication of ''[[Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance]]'', a report sponsored in part by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Roco and Bainbridge 2003"&gt;{{cite book| editor = Roco, Mihail C.| editor2 = Bainbridge, William Sims| editor2-link = William Sims Bainbridge| title = [[Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance]]| publisher = Springer| date = 2003| isbn = 1-4020-1254-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other acronyms have been offered for the same concept such as GNR ([[Genetics|'''G'''enetics]], '''N'''anotechnology and [[Robotics|'''R'''obotics]]) ([[Bill Joy]], 2000, [[Why The Future Doesn't Need Us|Why the future doesn't need us]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Why the Future Doesn't Need Us | first = Bill | last= Joy | authorlink= Bill Joy | url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html |publisher= Wired |date= 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Examples of technology implications ==

Convergent solutions include both [[Landline|fixed-line]] and mobile technologies. Recent examples of new, convergent services include:

* Using the Internet for voice and [[video telephony]]
* [[Video on demand]]
* [[Fixed-mobile convergence]]
* [[Mobile-to-mobile convergence]]
* [[Location-based service]]s
* Integrated products and bundles

Convergent technologies can integrate the fixed-line with mobile to deliver convergent solutions. Convergent technologies include:

* [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]]
* [[Session Initiation Protocol]]
* [[IPTV]]
* [[Voice over IP]]
* [[Voice call continuity]]
* [[DVB-H|Digital video broadcasting – handheld]]

==Convergence in appliances==
Some media observers expect that we will eventually access all media content through one device, or "black box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-04-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_071_1986_Apr#page/n21/mode/2|title=Compute! Magazine Issue 071|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, media business practice has been to identify the next "black box" to invest in and provide media for. This has caused a number of problems. Firstly, as "black boxes" are invented and abandoned, the individual is left with numerous devices that can perform the same task, rather than one dedicated for each task. For example, one may own both a computer and a video games console, subsequently owning two DVD players. This is contrary to the streamlined goal of the "black box" theory, and instead creates clutter.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2006, 15&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, technological convergence tends to be experimental in nature. This has led to consumers owning technologies with additional functions that are harder, if not impractical, to use rather than one specific device. Many people would only watch the TV for the duration of the meal's cooking time, or whilst in the kitchen, but would not use the microwave as the household TV. These examples show that in many cases technological convergence is unnecessary or unneeded.

Furthermore, although consumers primarily use a specialized media device for their needs, other "black box" devices that perform the same task can be used to suit their current situation. As a 2002 Cheskin Research report explained: "...Your email needs and expectations are different whether you're at home, work, school, commuting, the airport, etc., and these different devices are designed to suit your needs for accessing content depending on where you are- your situated context." Despite the creation of "black boxes", intended to perform all tasks, the trend is to use devices that can suit the consumer's physical position.&lt;ref&gt;Cheskin Research. "Designing Digital Experiences for Youth", Market Insights Series, Fall 2002 pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the variable utility of portable technology, convergence occurs in high end mobile devices. They incorporate multimedia services, GPS, Internet access, and mobile telephony into a single device, heralding the rise of what has been termed the "smart phone," a device designed to remove the need to carry multiple devices. Convergence of media occurs when multiple products come together to form one product with the advantages of all of them, also known as the black box. This idea of one technology, concocted by [[Henry Jenkins]], has become known more as a fallacy because of the inability to actually put all technical pieces into one. For example, while people can have e-mail and Internet on their phone, they still want full computers with Internet and e-mail in addition. Mobile phones are a good example, in that they  incorporate [[digital camera]]s, mp3 players, [[dictaphone|voice recorder]]s, and other devices. This type of convergence is popular.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} For the consumer, it means more features in less space; for [[media conglomerate]]s it means remaining competitive.

However, convergence has a downside. Particularly in initial forms, converged devices are frequently less functional and reliable than their component parts (e.g., a mobile phone's web browser may not render some web pages correctly, due to not supporting certain rendering methods, such as the [[iPhone]] browser not supporting [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] content). As the number of functions in a single device escalates, the ability of that device to serve its original function decreases.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. 2006. ''Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide'' New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As Rheingold asserts, technological convergence holds immense potential for the "improvement of life and liberty in some ways and (could) degrade it in others".&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"/&gt; He believes the same technology has the potential to be "used as both a weapon of social control and a means of resistance".&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"/&gt; Since technology has evolved in the past ten years or so, companies are beginning to converge technologies to create demand for new products. This includes phone companies integrating [[3G]] and [[4G]] on their phones. In the mid 20th century, television converged the technologies of movies and radio, and television is now being converged with the mobile phone industry and the Internet. Phone calls are also being made with the use of personal computers. Converging technologies combine multiple technologies into one. Newer mobile phones feature cameras, and can hold images, videos, music, and other media. Manufacturers now integrate more advanced features, such as video recording, GPS receivers, data storage, and security mechanisms into the traditional cellphone.

==Convergence on the internet==
The role of the [[internet]] has changed from its original use as a communication tool to easier and faster access to information and services, mainly through a [[broadband]] connection. The television, radio and newspapers were the world's media for accessing news and entertainment; now, all three media have converged into one, and people all over the world can read and hear news and other information on the internet. The convergence of the internet and conventional TV became popular in the 2010s, through [[Smart TV]], also sometimes referred to as "Connected TV" or "Hybrid TV", (not to be confused with [[IPTV]], [[Internet TV]], or with [[Web television|Web TV]]). Smart TV is used to describe the current trend of integration of the Internet and [[Web 2.0]] features into modern [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es, as well as the technological convergence between computers and these television sets or set-top boxes. These new [[information appliance|devices]] most often also have a much higher focus on [[online]] [[interactive media]], [[Internet TV]], [[over-the-top content]], as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and less focus on traditional [[broadcasting|broadcast]] media like previous generations of [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es always have had.&lt;ref name="businessinsider1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Kovach |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-2010-12 |title=What Is A Smart TV? |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital convergence==
Digital Convergence means inclination for various innovations, media sources, content that become similar with the time. It enables the convergence of access devices and content as well as the industry participant operations and strategy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Product Management, Technology and Practice: Interdisciplinary Perspectives: Interdisciplinary Perspectives|last=Strader|first=Troy|publisher=Business Science Reference|year=2011|isbn=9781616928773|location=Hershey, PA|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is how this type of technological convergence creates opportunities, particularly in the area of product development and growth strategies for digital product companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The same can be said in the case of individual content producers such as vloggers in the [[YouTube]] video-sharing platform. The convergence in this example is demonstrated in the involvement of the Internet, home devices such as smart television, camera, the YouTube application, and the digital content. In this setup, there are the so-called "spokes",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategies and Policies in Digital Convergence|last=Park|first=Sangin|publisher=Idea Group Reference|year=2007|isbn=1599041561|location=Hershey, PA|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are the devices that connect to a central hub, which could either be the smart TV or PC. Here, the Internet serves as the intermediary, particularly through its interactivity tools and social networking, in order to create unique mixes of products and services via horizontal integration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The above example highlights how digital convergence encompasses three phenomena:

# previously stand-alone devices are being connected by networks and software, significantly enhancing functionalities;
# previously stand-alone products are being converged onto the same platform, creating hybrid products in the process; and,
# companies are crossing traditional boundaries such as hardware and software to provide new products and new sources of competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing of High-technology Products and Innovations|last=Mohr|first=Jakki|last2=Sengupta|first2=Sanjit|last3=Slater|first3=Stanley|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=9780136049968|location=Upper Saddle, NJ|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the convergence of different types of digital contents. According to Harry Strasser, former CTO of [[Siemens]] "[digital convergence will substantially impact people's lifestyle and work style]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1110194/A_Computing_Studio_Method_for_Teaching_Design_Thinking|title=A Computing Studio Method for Teaching Design Thinking|last=Van der Post|first=L.|date=2010|publisher=Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University|pages=12–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next hot trend in digital convergence is converged content, mixing personal (user-generated) content with professional (copyright protected) content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/15/the-new-media-ownership-law-doesnt-address-the-real-crisis-journalism-is-facing|title=The new media ownership law doesn't address the real crisis journalism is facing|publisher=The Guardian|author=Margaret Simons}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example are personal music videos that combine user-generated photos with chart music. The German startup [[Trivid GmbH]] has developed [[Clipgenerator]] that enables users to create personal music videos with popular chart music and to share them in social communities such as [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]] and [[Bebo]].

==Convergence in the marketplace==
Convergence is a global marketplace dynamic in which different companies and sectors are being brought together, both as competitors and collaborators, across traditional boundaries of industry and technology. In a world dominated by convergence, many traditional products, services and types of companies will become less relevant, but a stunning array of new ones is possible. An array of technology developments act as accelerators of convergence, including mobility, analytics, cloud, digital and social networks. As a disruptive force, convergence is a threat to the unprepared, but a tremendous growth opportunity for companies that can out-innovate and out-execute their ever-expanding list of competitors under dramatically new marketplace rules. With convergence, lines are blurred as companies diversify outside of their original markets. For instance, mobile services are increasingly an important part of the automobile; chemicals companies work with agribusiness; device manufacturers sell music, video and books; booksellers become consumer device companies; search and advertising companies become telecommunications companies ("telcos"); media companies act like telcos and vice versa; retailers act like financial services companies and vice versa; cosmetics companies work with pharmaceutical companies; and more. Mobile phone usage broadens dramatically, enabling users to make payments online, watch videos, or even adjusting their home thermostat while away at work.

==Media convergence{{anchor|Media}}==
Generally, media convergence refers to the merging of both old and new media and can be seen as a product, a system or a process. Jenkins states that convergence is, "the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behaviour of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted"&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (2006) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, pg 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jenkins, there are five areas of convergence: technological, economic, social or organic, cultural and global.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of global online journalism, edited by Eugenia Siapera and  Andreas Vilglis, pg 26&lt;/ref&gt; So media convergence is not just a technological shift or a technological process, it also includes shifts within the industrial, cultural, and social paradigms that encourage the consumer to seek out new information. Convergence, simply put, is how individual consumers interact with others on a social level and use various media platforms to create new experiences, new forms of media and content that connect us socially, and not just to other consumers, but to the corporate producers of media in ways that have not been as readily accessible in the past. However, Lugmayr and Dal Zotto argued, that media convergence takes place on technology, content, consumer, business model, and management level.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 2, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926&lt;/ref&gt; They argue, that media convergence is a matter of evolution and can be described through the triadic phenomenon of convergence, divergence, and coexistence. Today's digital media ecosystems coexist, as e.g. mobile app stores provide vendor lock-ins into particular eco-systems; some technology platforms are converging under one technology, due to e.g. the usage of common communication protocols as in digital TV; and other media are diverging, as e.g. media content offerings are more and more specializing and provides a space for niche media.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence is NOT King: The Triadic Phenomenon of Media 'Convergence-Divergence-Coexistance' is King. Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302467971_Media_Convergence_is_NOT_King_The_Triadic_Phenomenon_of_Media_Convergence-Divergence-Coexistence_IS_King&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in technology bring the ability for technological convergence that Rheingold believes can alter the "social-side effects," in that "the virtual, social and physical world are colliding, merging and coordinating."&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"&gt;Rheingold, Howard (2000) Smart Mobs: the next social revolution, Perseus, Cambridge, Massachusetts, pp 157–82&lt;/ref&gt; It was predicted in the late 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1988-02-compute-magazine|title=COMPUTE! magazine issue 93 Feb 1988|quote=If the wheels behind the CD-ROM industry have their way, this product will help open the door to a brave, new multimedia world for  microcomputers, where the computer is intimately linked with the other household electronics, and every gadget in the house reads  tons of video, audio, and text data from CD-ROM disks. }}&lt;/ref&gt; around the time that [[CD-ROM]] was becoming commonplace, that a [[digital revolution]] would take place, and that old media would be pushed to one side by [[new media]]. Broadcasting is increasingly being replaced by the Internet, enabling consumers all over the world the freedom to access their preferred media content more easily and at a more available rate than ever before.

However, when the [[dot-com bubble]] of the 1990s suddenly popped, that poured cold water over the talk of such a digital revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. (2008) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, 2nd ed., p.6&lt;/ref&gt; In today's society, the idea of media convergence has once again emerged as a key point of reference as newer as well as established media companies attempt to visualize the future of the entertainment industry. If this revolutionary digital paradigm shift presumed that old media would be increasingly replaced by new media, the convergence paradigm that is currently emerging suggests that new and old media would interact in more complex ways than previously predicted. The paradigm shift that followed the digital revolution assumed that new media was going to change everything. When the dot com market crashed, there was a tendency to imagine that nothing had changed. The real truth lay somewhere in between as there were so many aspects of the current media environment to take into consideration. Many industry leaders are increasingly reverting to media convergence as a way of making sense in an era of disorientating change. In that respect, media convergence in theory is essentially an old concept taking on a new meaning. Media convergence, in reality, is more than just a shift in technology. It alters relationships between industries, technologies, audiences, genres and markets. Media convergence changes the rationality media industries operate in, and the way that media consumers process news and entertainment. Media convergence is essentially a process and not an outcome, so no single black box controls the flow of media. With proliferation of different media channels and increasing portability of new telecommunications and computing technologies, we have entered into an era where media constantly surrounds us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiner | first=Tobias | title=Under the Macroscope: Convergence in the US Television Market between 2000 and 2014 | url=https://www.academia.edu/2017902/Under_the_Macroscope_Convergence_in_the_US_Television_Market_between_2000_and_2014 | work=academia.edu|accessdate=4 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media convergence requires that media companies rethink existing assumptions about media from the consumer's point of view, as these affect marketing and programming decisions. Media producers must respond to newly empowered consumers.
Conversely, it would seem that hardware is instead diverging whilst media content is converging. Media has developed into brands that can offer content in a number of forms. Two examples of this are ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''. Both are films, but are also books, video games, cartoons, and action figures. Branding encourages expansion of one concept, rather than the creation of new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2006, p.101-112&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, hardware has diversified to accommodate media convergence. Hardware must be specific to each function. While most scholars argue that the flow of cross-media is accelerating,&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins H, Deuze M (2008) Editorial: Convergence culture. Convergence 14(1): 5¡V12.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell suggests, especially between films and video game, the semblance of media convergence is misunderstood by people outside of the media production industry. The conglomeration of media industry continues to sell the same story line in different media. For example, Batman is  in comics, films, anime, and games. However, the data to create the image of batman in each media is created individually by different teams of creators. The same character and the same visual effect repetitively appear in different media is because of the synergy of media industry to make them similar as possible.  In addition, convergence does not happen when the game of two different consoles is produced. No flows between two consoles because it is faster to create game from scratch for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, Casey.

One of the more interesting new media journalism forms is virtual reality. Reuters, a major international news service, has created and staffed a news “island” in the popular online virtual reality environment Second Life (www.secondlife.com, accessed January 3, 2008). Open to anyone, Second Life has emerged as a compelling 3D virtual reality for millions of citizens around the world who have created avatars (virtual representations of themselves) to populate and live in an altered state where personal flight is a reality, altered egos can flourish, and real money (US$1,296,257 were spent during the 24 hours concluding at 10:19&amp;nbsp;a.m. eastern time January 7, 2008) can be made without ever setting foot into the real world. The Reuters Island in Second Life is a virtual version of the Reuters real-world news service but covering the domain of Second Life for the citizens of Second Life (numbering 11,807,742 residents as of January 5, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Pavlic J. V. New Media Journalism // 21st Century Communication. A Reference Handbook. Volume 1 &amp; 2. /Ed. By William F. Eadie. Los Angeles, 2009. 970 p. P. 643-651.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media convergence in the digital era means the changes that are taking place with older forms of media and media companies. Media convergence has two roles, the first is the technological merging of different media channels – for example, magazines, radio programs, TV shows, and movies, now are available on the Internet through laptops, iPads, and smartphones. As discussed in ''Media Culture'' (by Campbell), convergence of technology is not new. It has been going on since the late 1920s.  An example is RCA, the Radio Corporation of America, which purchased Victor Talking Machine Company and introduced machines that could receive radio and play recorded music.  Next came the TV, and radio lost some of its appeal as people started watching television, which has both talking and music as well as visuals.  As technology advances, convergence of media change to keep up. The second definition of media convergence Campbell discusses is cross-platform by media companies. This usually involves consolidating various media holdings, such as cable, phone, television (over the air, satellite, cable) and Internet access under one corporate umbrella. This is not for the consumer to have more media choices, this is for the benefit of the company to cut down on costs and maximize its profits.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;Campbell, Richard, Christopher R. Martin, and Bettina Fabos. Media &amp; Culture An Introduction To Mass Communication. 8th ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2013. 9–10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  As stated in the article, Convergence Culture and Media Work, by Mark Deuze, “the convergence of production and consumption of media across companies, channels, genres, and technologies is an expression of the convergence of all aspects of everyday life: work and play, the local and the global, self and social identity."&lt;ref name=Holt&gt;Holt, Jennifer, and Alisa Perren, eds. Media Industries History, Theory and Method. West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009. 145. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergence culture ===

[[Henry Jenkins]] determines convergence culture to be the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want. The convergence culture is an important factor in [[transmedia storytelling]].  Convergence culture introduces new stories and arguments from one form of media into many. Transmedia storytelling is defined by Jenkins as a process "where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience. Ideally, each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://henryjenkins.org/2011/08/defining_transmedia_further_re.html#sthash.xLqb8MkC.dpuf |title= Transmedia 202: Further Reflections |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate= April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]] starts as a [[The Matrix|film]], which is followed by two other instalments, but in a convergence culture it is not constrained to that form. It becomes a story not only told in the movies but in [[The Animatrix|animated shorts]], video games and comic books, three different media platforms. Online, a wiki is created to keep track of the story's expanding canon. Fan films, discussion forums, and social media pages also form, expanding The Matrix to different online platforms. Convergence culture took what started as a film and expanded it across almost every type of media.&lt;ref name="Jenkens 2009"&gt;HCD Media Group, . Henry Jenkins. 2009. Video. YouTube.Com Web. 7 Feb 2013. &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibJaqXVaOaI&amp;feature=player_embedded&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bert is Evil]] (images) Bert and Bin Laden appeared in [[CNN]] coverage of anti-American protest following September 11. The association of Bert and Bin Laden links back to the Ignacio's Photoshop project for fun.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins, H. ''Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide''. New York: New York UP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

Convergence culture is a part of [[participatory culture]]. Because average people can now access their interests on many types of media they can also have more of a say. Fans and consumers are able to participate in the creation and circulation of new content. Some companies take advantage of this and search for feedback from their customers through social media and sharing sites such as [[YouTube]]. 
Besides marketing and entertainment, convergence culture has also affected the way we interact with news and information. We can access news on multiple levels of media from the radio, TV, newspapers, and the internet. The internet allows more people to be able to report the news through independent broadcasts and therefore allows a multitude of perspectives to be put forward and accessed by people in many different areas. Convergence allows news to be gathered on a much larger scale. For instance, photographs were taken of torture at [[Abu Ghraib]]. These photos were shared and eventually posted on the internet. This led to the breaking of a news story in newspapers, on TV, and the internet.&lt;ref name="Jenkens 2009"/&gt;

Media scholar Henry Jenkins has described the media convergence with [[participatory culture]] as:

{{quote|...a "catalyst" for amateur digital film-making and what this case study suggests about the future directions popular culture may take. Star Wars fan films represent the intersection of two significant cultural trends—the corporate movement towards media convergence and the unleashing of significant new tools, which enable the grassroots archiving, annotation, appropriation, and recirculation of media content. These fan films build on long-standing practices of the fan community but they also reflect the influence of this changed technological environment that has dramatically lowered the costs of film production and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html|title=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|work=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Cell phone convergence ===
The social function of the cell phone changes as the technology converges. Because of technological advancement, cell phones function more than just as a phone. They contain an internet connection, video players, MP3 players, gaming, and a camera. Another example, [[Rok Sako To Rok Lo]] (2004) was screened in Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and other part of India through EDGE-enabled mobile phones with live video streaming facility.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Social movements ===
The integration of [[social movement]]s in cyberspace is one of the potential strategies that social movements can use in the age of media convergence. Because of the [[Net neutrality|neutrality of the internet]] and the [[End-to-end principle|end-to-end design]], the power structure of the internet was designed to avoid discrimination between applications. Mexico's [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] campaign for land rights was one of the most influential case in the information age; Manuel Castells defines the Zapatistas as "the first informational guerrilla movement".&lt;ref&gt;Castells, 2004:82&lt;/ref&gt; The Zapatista uprising had been marginalized by the popular press. The Zapatistas were able to construct a grassroots, decentralized social movement by using the internet. The Zapatistas Effect, observed by Cleaver,&lt;ref&gt;Cleaver, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; continues to organize social movements on a global scale. A sophisticated webmetric analysis, which maps the links between different websites and seeks to identify important nodal points in a network, demonstrates that the Zapatistas cause binds together hundreds of global NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;Garrido and Halavais, 2003:181&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the social movement organized by Zapatistas targets their campaign especially against global neoliberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Cleaver, 1988:630&lt;/ref&gt; A successful social movement not only need online support but also protest on the street. Papic wrote, "Social Media Alone Do Not Instigate Revolutions", which discusses how the use of social media in social movements needs good organization both online and offline.&lt;ref&gt;Papic, M., Noonan, S. (2011) "Social Media As a Tool for Protest." Stratfor, 3 Feb. 2011. Web. 20 Nov. 2011. {{cite web |url=http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110202-social-media-tool-protest |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512075702/http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110202-social-media-tool-protest |archivedate=2013-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study, "Journalism in the age of media convergence: a survey of undergraduates’ technology-related news habits", concluded that several focus group respondents reported they generally did not actively engage in media convergence, such as viewing slide shows or listening to podcast that accompanied an online story, as part of their Web-based news consumption, a significant number of students indicated the interactive features often associated with online news and media convergence were indeed appealing to them.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins, L,.

== Examples in Regulation ==

===Example: VoIP===
The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has not been able to decide how to regulate VoIP (Internet Telephony) because the convergent technology is still growing and changing. In addition to its growth, FCC is tentative to set regulation on VoIP in order to promote competition in the telecommunication industry.&lt;ref&gt;Written in 2011, 10, 27&lt;/ref&gt; There is not a clear line between telecommunication service and the information service because of the growth of the new convergent media. Historically, telecommunication is subject to state regulation. The state of California concerned about the increasing popularity of internet telephony will eventually obliterate funding for the [[Universal Service Fund]]&lt;ref&gt;Kopytoff, V. (2005). Internet Phones in Spotlight, Companies face more scrutiny by U.S., state agencies. IP Telephony News, March, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states attempt to assert their traditional role of common carrier oversight onto this new technology.&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, J (2004). California Regulator Vote to Exammine Rules to Control Voice Over Internet Protocol. ''Electronic Commerce and Law Report'' (Vol. 9, No.7) 156-57&lt;/ref&gt; Meisel and Needles (2005) suggests that the FCC, federal courts, and state regulatory bodies on access line charges will directly impact the speed in which Internet telephony market grows.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel, J., Needles, M. Voice over Internet protocol development and public policy Implications. INFO: ''the journal of policy, regulation and strategy for telecommunications, information and media,'' Vol.7, Number 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, the FCC is hesitant to regulate convergent technology because VoIP with different feature from the old Telecommunication; no fixed model to build legislature yet. On the other hand, the regulations is needed because Service over the internet might be quickly replaced telecommunication service, which will affect the entire economy.

Convergence has also raised several debates about classification of certain telecommunications services. As the lines between data transmission, and voice and media transmission are eroded, regulators are faced with the task of how best to classify the converging segments of the telecommunication sector. Traditionally, telecommunication regulation has focused on the operation of physical infrastructure, networks, and access to network. No content is regulated in the telecommunication because the content is considered private. In contrast, film and Television are regulated by contents. The rating system regulates its distribution to the audience. Self-regulation is promoted by the industry. Bogle senior persuaded the entire industry to pay 0.1 percent levy on all advertising and the money was used to give authority to the Advertising Standards Authority, which keeps the government away from setting legislature in the media industry.&lt;ref&gt;PERSPECTIVE: Media convergence puts self-regulation at top of the agenda." Campaign 1 Nov. 2002: 02. General Reference Center GOLD. Web. 13 Oct. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The premises to regulate the new media, two-ways communications, concerns much about the change from old media to new media. Each medium has different features and characteristics. First, internet, the new medium, manipulates all form of information – voice, data and video. Second, the old regulation on the old media, such as radio and Television, emphasized its regulation on the scarcity of the channels. Internet, on the other hand, has the limitless capacity, due to the end-to-end design. Third, Two-ways communication encourages interactivity between the content producers and the audiences. 
"...Fundamental basis for classification, therefore, is to consider the need for regulation in terms of either market failure or in the public interests"(Blackman).&lt;ref&gt;

===Emerging trends in communications===
[[Network neutrality]] has emerged as an issue. Wu and Lessig (2004) set out two reasons to adapt neutral network model for computer networks. First, "a neutral network eliminates the risk of future discrimination, providing more incentive to invest in broadband application development." Second, "neutral network facilitates fair competition among application, no bias between applications."&lt;ref&gt;Wu, T., Lessig, L. EX Parte Submission in CS Docket No. 02-52. August, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The two reasons also coincide with FCC's interest to stimulate investment and enhance innovation in broadband technology and services.&lt;ref&gt;FCC, 2004d&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FCC (2004d). Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, March 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite regulatory efforts of deregulation, privatization, and liberalization, the  infrastructure barrier has been a negative factor in achieving effective competition. "Kim et al. argues that IP dissociates the telephony application from the infrastructure and Internet telephony is at the forefront of such dissociation."&lt;ref&gt;Kim, et al. Regulating Internet telephony: The Challenges and the Opportunities. Proceedings of 15th Portland International Conference on Technology Management.&lt;/ref&gt;  The neutrality of the network is very important for fair competition.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, T. (2004). Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination, Journal of Telecommunications &amp; High Technology Law, Vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As the former FCC Charman [[Michael Powell]] put it: "From its inception, the Internet was designed, as those present during the course of its creating will tell you, to prevent government or a corporation or anyone else from controlling it. It was designed to defeat [[discrimination]] against users, ideas and technologies".&lt;ref&gt;FCC (2004f). Remarks of Michael J. Copps: Federal Communications Commissioner: The Beginning Of The End Of The Internet? Discrimination, Closed Networks, And The Future of Cyberspace New America Foundation, Washington, Dc. October 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these reasons, Shin concludes that regulator should make sure to regulate application and infrastructure separately.

The layered model was first proposed by Solum and Chug, Sicker, and Nakahata. Sicker, Warbach and Witt have supported using a layered model to regulate the telecommunications industry with the emergence of convergence services. Many researchers have different layered approach, but they all agree that the emergence of convergent technology will create challenges and ambiguities for regulations.&lt;ref name = "Shin"/&gt; The key point of the layered model is that it reflects the reality of network architecture, and current business model.&lt;ref name = "Whitt"&gt;Whitt, R.S. (2004). A Horizontal Leap Forward: Formulating a New Communications
Public Policy Framework Based on the Network Layers Mode. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS
LAW JOURNAL, Vol. 56, Number 3, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
The layered Model consists of 1. Access Layer – where the physical infrastructure resides: copper wires, cable, or fiber optic. 2. transport layer – the provider of service. 3. Application layer –  the interface between the data and the users. 4. content layer – the layer which users see.&lt;ref name = "Whitt"/&gt; In ''Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications'', Shin combines the Layered Model and Network Neutrality as the principle to regulate the future convergent Media Industry.&lt;ref&gt;Shin, D. , Kim, W. and Lee, D. , 2006-06-16 "Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Dresden International Congress Centre, Dresden, Germany Online &lt;PDF&gt;. 2011-03-14 from http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p91470_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example: Messaging==
Combination services include those that integrate SMS with voice, such as voice SMS. Providers include Bubble Motion, Jott, Kirusa, and SpinVox. Several operators have launched services that combine SMS with mobile instant messaging (MIM) and presence. Text-to-landline services also exist, where subscribers can send text messages to any landline phone and are charged at standard rates. The text messages are converted into spoken language. This service has been popular in America, where fixed and mobile numbers are similar. Inbound SMS has been converging to enable reception of different formats (SMS, voice, MMS, etc.). UK companies, including consumer goods companies and media giants, should soon{{when|date=May 2011}} be able to let consumers contact them via voice, SMS, MMS, IVR, or video using one five-digit number or [[long number]]. In April 2008, O2 UK launched voice-enabled shortcodes, adding voice functionality to the five-digit codes already used for SMS. This type of convergence is helpful for media companies, broadcasters, enterprises, call centres and help desks who need to develop a consistent contact strategy with the consumer. Because SMS is very popular today, it became relevant to include [[text messaging]] as a contact possibility for consumers. To avoid having multiple numbers (one for voice calls, another one for SMS), a simple way is to merge the reception of both formats under one number. This means that a consumer can text or call one number and be sure that the message will be received.

==Example: Mobile==
"Mobile service provisions" refers not only to the ability to purchase mobile phone services, but the ability to wirelessly access everything: voice, Internet, audio, and video. Advancements in [[WiMAX]] and other leading edge technologies provide the ability to transfer information over a wireless link at a variety of speeds, distances, and non-line-of-sight conditions.

==Example: Multi-play in telecommunications==
Multi-play is a marketing term describing the provision of different telecommunication services, such as [[Internet access]], television, telephone, and mobile phone service, by organisations that traditionally only offered one or two of these services. Multi-play is a catch-all phrase; usually, the terms [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] (voice, video and data) or quadruple play (voice, video, data and wireless) are used to describe a more specific meaning. A dual play service is a marketing term for the provisioning of the two services: it can be high-speed Internet ([[digital subscriber line]]) and telephone service over a single broadband connection in the case of phone companies, or high-speed Internet ([[cable modem]]) and TV service over a single broadband connection in the case of cable TV companies. The convergence can also concern the underlying communication [[infrastructure]]. An example of this is a [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service, where communication services are packaged allowing consumers to purchase TV, Internet, and [[telephony]] in one subscription. The broadband cable market is transforming as pay-TV providers move aggressively into what was once considered the telco space. Meanwhile, customer expectations have risen as consumer and business customers alike seek rich content, multi-use devices, networked products and converged services including on-demand video, digital TV, high speed Internet, VoIP, and wireless applications. It is uncharted territory for most broadband companies.

A quadruple play service combines the [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service of broadband Internet access, television, and telephone with [[wireless]] service provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm Integrated Design for VoIP-Enabled Quadruple Play Devices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226070457/http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm |date=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This service set is also sometimes humorously referred to as "The [[Fantastic Four]]" or "Grand Slam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|title=Cable consortium mobilizes quad-play with Sprint|work=CED|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927040031/http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental aspect of the quadruple play is not only the long-awaited broadband convergence but also the players involved. Many of them, from the largest global service providers to whom we connect today via wires and cables to the smallest of startup service providers are interested. Opportunities are attractive: the big three telecom services – [[telephony]], cable television, and [[wireless]]—could combine their industries. In the UK, the merger of [[Virgin Media|NTL:Telewest]] and [[Virgin Mobile]] resulted in a company offering a quadruple play of cable television, broadband Internet, home telephone, and mobile telephone services.

==Example: Home network==
Early in the 21st century, home LAN convergence so rapidly integrated home [[Router (computing)|router]]s, [[wireless access point]]s, and [[DSL modem]]s that users were hard put to identify the resulting box they used to connect their computers to their Internet service. A general term for such a combined device is a [[residential gateway]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1668">The ''Teramac'' was an experimental massively [[Parallel computing|parallel computer]] designed by [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] in the 1990s. The name reflected the project's vision to provide a programmable gate array system with capacity for a million gates running at a megahertz. Contrary to traditional systems, which are useless if there is ''one'' defect, Teramac used defective [[CPU|processors]] -- intentionally -- to demonstrate its defect-tolerant architecture. Even though the computer had 220,000 hardware defects, it was able to perform some tasks 100 times faster than a single-processor high-end [[workstation]].

Teramac was originally developed by scientists in HP's central research lab, [[HP Labs]], in the mid 1990s. Although it contained conventional silicon [[integrated circuit]] technology, it paved the way for some of HP's work in [[nanoelectronics]] because it provided an architecture on which a chemically assembled computer could operate.

The experience from this program was used to design the [[Field Programmable Nanowire Interconnect]] circuit.

[[File:Colobocentrotus atratus MHNT Bali Test.jpg|thumb|Test of a shingle urchin (''[[Colobocentrotus atratus]]'')]]

In biology, a '''test''' is the hard [[Seashell|shell]] of some spherical marine animals, notably [[sea urchin]]s and microorganisms such as testate [[foraminiferan]]s, [[radiolarian]]s, and [[testate amoebae]].

== Etymology ==
The anatomical term "test" derives from the Latin ''testa'' (which means a rounded bowl, amphora or bottle). It is distinct from the term "test" as in "[[test (assessment)|examination]]", which derives from ''testis'', related to the idea of testimony.

== Structure ==
The test is a skeletal structure, made of hard material such as [[calcium carbonate]], [[silica]], [[chitin]] or composite materials. As such, it allows the protection of the internal organs and the attachment of soft flesh.

== In sea urchins ==
[[Image:Paracentrotus lividus MHNT France.jpg|thumb|Test of a sea urchin.]]
The test of [[sea urchin]]s is made of calcium carbonate, strengthened by a framework of calcite monocrystals, in a characteristic "stereomic" structure. These two ingredients provide sea urchins with a great solidity and a moderate weight, as well as the capacity to regenerate the mesh from the cuticle. According to a 2012 study,&lt;ref name="Urchin"/&gt; the skeletal structures of sea urchins consist of 92% of "bricks" of calcite monocrystals (conferring solidity and hardness) and 8% of a "mortar" of amorphous lime (allowing flexibility and lightness). This lime is constituted itself of 99.9% of calcium carbonate, with 0.1% structural proteins, which make sea urchins animals with an extremely mineralized skeleton (which also explains their excellent conservation as fossils).&lt;ref name="Urchin"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=J.

== In foraminiferans ==
[[Image:Foraminifères de Ngapali.jpg|thumb|Foraminiferan tests.]]
The test of [[foraminiferan]] initially consists of gradually mineralized organic matter, but also sometimes exogenous agglomerated particles (in particular for species living in the sediment or in great depth). It can be of many types, like agglutinated (exogenous agglomerate), microgranular (with calcite grains), porcelain-like (smooth calcite) or hyalin (lens). Foraminiferans develops by building new rooms in their test. These are arranged according to a geometry particular to each species: they can be rectilinear, curved, rolled up or cyclic, and every time uniserial or multiserial. These organizational types can also be mixed, or even more complex. Miliolids have a particular arrangement. The surface of the test can be smooth or textured.

== In ascidians ==
In [[ascidian]]s the sheath is sometimes called test as well, and is composed largely of a particular type of [[cellulose]] historically termed "tunicine". From 1845 (when this was discovered by [[Carl Schmidt (chemist)|Schmidt]]) until 1958 (when cellulose fibres were found in mammalian connective tissue), ascidians were believed to be the only animals that synthesised cellulose.&lt;ref&gt;Endean, [http://jcs.biologists.org/content/s3-102/57/107.full.pdf The Test of the Ascidian, Phallusia mammillata], Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, Vol. 102, part 1, pp. 107-117, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terms ==
On a strictly scientific point of view, the term "test" should be restricted to the hard shell protecting sea urchins and foraminiferans. For sessile echinoderms (like [[crinoid]]s, but also many fossile groups such as [[cistoid]]s or [[blastoid]]s), the correct word is "[[theca]]". For [[diatomea]], the term in use is "[[frustule]]", and for [[radiolarian]]s it should be "[[Bacterial capsule|capsule]]". The more common word "[[Mollusc shell|shell]]" is used for [[mollusk]]s, [[Exoskeleton|arthropod]]s and [[Turtle shell|turtle]]s (even if the latter ones belong to the order "[[Testudines]]").

'''''The Commissar Vanishes: The Falsification of Photographs and Art in Stalin's Russia''''' is a 1997 book by [[David King (designer)|David King]] about the [[Censorship of images in the Soviet Union|censoring of photographs]] and fraudulent creation of "photographs" in [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]] through silent alteration via airbrushing and other techniques.  It has an introduction by [[Stephen F. Cohen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=2514 |title=The Commissar Vanishes: Falsification of Photographs and Art in Stalin’s Russia, Review |first1=Tamara ([[Oakland University]]) |last1=Machmut-Jhashi |work=H-Russia |date=November 1998 |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Commissar Vanishes: The Falsification of Photographs and Art in Stalin's Russia |type=Hardcover |date=October 15, 1997 |first1=David |last1=King |pages=192 pages |publisher=[[Metropolitan Books]] |edition=1 (October 15, 1997) |isbn= 0805052941 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Commissar-Vanishes-Falsification-Photographs-Stalins/dp/0805052941 &lt;!-- |ISBN=978-0805052947 --&gt; |location=New York, NY |accessdate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Nyman]] created a companion album of the same title in 1999.  The second disc of the two-disc album contains ''The Fall of Icarus'', the score to an eponymous [[art installation]] by [[Peter Greenaway]] from [[1986 in art|1986]] which had previously been unreleased.  The first disc, ''The Commissar Vanishes'', is a version of ''The Fall of Icarus'' that has been defaced similarly to the photographs reproduced in King's book.

'''''The Musical Quarterly''''' is the oldest academic journal on music in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramsey|first=Guthrey P., Jr.|title=Cosmopolitan or Provincial?: Ideology in Early Black Music Historiography, 1867-1940|journal=Black Music Research Journal|date=Spring 1996|volume=16|issue=1|pages=21|jstor=779375|doi=10.2307/779375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally established in 1915 by [[Oscar Sonneck]], the journal was edited by Sonneck until his death in 1928. Sonneck was succeeded by a number of editors, including [[Carl Engel]] (1930-1944), [[Gustave Reese]] (1944-45), [[Paul Henry Lang]], who edited the journal for over 25 years, from 1945 to 1973, [[Joan Peyser]] (1977-84), [[Eric Salzman]] who served as editor from 1984 to 1991 and several others.

Since 1993 ''The Musical Quarterly'' has been edited by [[Leon Botstein]], president of [[Bard College]] and principal conductor of the [[American Symphony Orchestra]]. It is published by [[Oxford University Press]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="787">'''Traditional transmission''' (also called '''cultural transmission''') is a design feature of [[language]] that the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Charles F. Hockett]] developed to distinguish the features of human language from those of [[animal communication]]. He discovered thirteen features that all human languages have. Animals might communicate with some of the thirteen basic design features of language but never with all of them. Traditional transmission is exemplified by the fact that language is learned in [[social group]]s. Although there is disagreement about how much linguistic capability humans are born with, it is known that the only way that humans learn language and refine its use as they grow is in social settings.
