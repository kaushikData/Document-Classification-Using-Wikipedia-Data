'''2 Broadway''' is an office building at the south end of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], near [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green Park]] in [[New York City]]. 2 Broadway was built on the site of the ''Produce Exchange Building'', and now houses the headquarters of the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]].

[[File:New York Produce Exchange 1883.jpg|thumb|left||300px|New York Produce Exchange (1883)]]

==Description and history==

The Produce Exchange was a representative structure of brick with terracotta decorations. Its grand skylighted hall, based on French retail structures, cast daylight into the lower floors. Its architect was [[George B. Post]], who built it from 1881–84. 

The Produce Exchange Building was demolished in 1957 and replaced by a 32-story tower constructed in 1958-1959. The developer, [[Uris Buildings Corporation]], first preferred a design by [[William Lescaze]] with [[Kahn &amp; Jacobs]], which featured a tower slab set at right angles to Broadway. However, ultimately [[Emery Roth &amp; Sons]] was given the contract, which saw a radically different design which would fill most of the lot, with the building rising in triple [[Setback (land use)|setback]]s. The facade is now covered in blue-green tinted glass.&lt;ref name=nycaob&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc-architecture.com/LM/LM017-2BROADWAY.htm |website=Nyc-architecture.com |title=2 Broadway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was vacating its headquarters at [[370 Jay Street]] in [[Downtown Brooklyn]]. The MTA rented space in 2 Broadway where it moved some of its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saying Farewell to an Old Friend|url=http://www.mta.info/news/2012/04/26/saying-farewell-old-friend|accessdate=October 14, 2016|work=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spellen|first1=Suzanne|title=Building of the Day: 370 Jay Street|url=http://www.brownstoner.com/architecture/building-of-the-day-370-jay-street/|accessdate=October 14, 2016|work=Brownstoner|date=January 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Tamir Sapir, a Russian immigrant and cab driver turned real-estate investor, bought 2 Broadway for $20 million, with the MTA as the only tenant in the building. The MTA signed a 49-year lease in July 1998, shortly after selling its [[New York Coliseum]]. Shortly after, Sapir and the MTA agreed to conduct $39 million worth of renovations to 2 Broadway. However, the renovations had become delayed and over budget, and Sapir and the MTA became involved in numerous lawsuits and countersuits. By 2000, the renovations were expected to cost $135 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bagli | first=Charles V. | title=Brass Knuckles Over 2 Broadway; M.T.A. and Landlord Are Fighting It Out Over Rent and Renovations | website=The New York Times | date=2000-08-09 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/09/nyregion/brass-knuckles-over-2-broadway-mta-landlord-are-fighting-it-over-rent.html | access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003, the cost of the renovations had risen to $435 million.

==In popular culture==
*2 Broadway features prominently throughout the American comedy-drama film ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), produced and directed by [[Billy Wilder]], as the building in which the characters played by stars [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Shirley MacLaine]], and [[Fred MacMurray]] work.
*The building was a filming location in the thriller ''[[Mirage (1965 film)|Mirage]]'' (1965), with [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Diane Baker]]. 
*The Produce Exchange Building can be briefly seen in the silent movie ''[[Speedy (film)|Speedy]]'' (1928), with [[Harold Lloyd]].

'''AATCC—the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists—'''is a 501(c)(6) not-for-profit professional association that provides test method development, quality control materials, educational development, and networking for textile and apparel professionals throughout the world.

==Activities==
AATCC has developed more than 200 textile-related standards, including test methods, evaluation procedures, and monographs. These standards are published each year in the ''AATCC Technical Manual''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aatcc.org/test/|title=Testing - AATCC Online|work=AATCC Online|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; All standards are developed and updated by volunteer members, through research committees. All industry stakeholders may participate in the standards-development process.

Before a standard is published in the ''AATCC Technical Manual'', it must be unanimously approved by voting members of the responsible research committee and the Technical Committee on Research (TCR). During the first three years, each new standard is reviewed annually, at which time, on recommendation of the research committee and approval by TCR, it may be reaffirmed, revised, or withdrawn. After the first three years, each standard is reviewed at least every five years. The content of many AATCC methods form the basis of equivalent ISO methods.

AATCC serves as secretary for the US Technical Advisory Committee (TAG) to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for International Organization for Standardization (ISO) textile test method development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.standardsportal.org/usa_en/resources/sdo.aspx|title=Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs)|website=www.standardsportal.org|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For many years, AATCC was also secretary of ISO TC38 SC1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/list_of_iso_technical_committee%20s/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=48172|title=ISO/TC 38/SC 1 - Tests for coloured textiles and colorants|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SC2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/list_of_iso_technical_committee%20s/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=48198|title=ISO/TC 38/SC 2 - Cleansing, finishing and water resistance tests|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

AATCC provides test method training at its laboratories, at members’ facilities, online, and in more than 10 countries around the globe. AATCC also offers test method proficiency programs and quality control products for use in conducting its test methods.

AATCC publishes a bi-monthly magazine, ''AATCC Review'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aatcc.org/pub/aatcc-review/|title=AATCC Review - AATCC Online|work=AATCC Online|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing technical articles, feature articles, and news for textile professionals. The Association also publishes the ''AATCC Journal of Research'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aatcc.org/pub/aatcc-journal/|title=AATCC Journal of Research - AATCC Online|work=AATCC Online|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; a bi-monthly online peer-reviewed research journal with a broad scope. The ''AATCC News'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aatcc.org/pub/aatcc-news/|title=AATCC News - AATCC Online|work=AATCC Online|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; a newsletter published twice per month, is distributed by e-mail.

==Organization==
Local sections and student chapters are formed by association members located in a particular geographical area. Sections and chapters further the exchange of textile information by arranging local meetings, lectures, and other technical or social activities. Several sections make up a region.

AATCC is administered by a board of directors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aatcc.org/aatcc-board-of-directors/|title=AATCC Board of Directors - AATCC Online|work=AATCC Online|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; including regional representatives who are elected by the members from their region, and Interest Group Chairs and At-Large members, who are elected from their Interest Groups. Eligible members of all regions elect the AATCC President-Elect. After two years, the President-Elect becomes President, who serves two years in that office before becoming Past-President for an additional two-year term (six years total commitment with specific duties and responsibilities for each office). AATCC staff is based at the AATCC Technical Center and provides administrative assistance to the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aatcc.org/abt/contact/department/|title=Contact AATCC by Department - AATCC Online|work=AATCC Online|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research committees, made up of volunteer members, are responsible for test method development. Administrative committees, also consisting of volunteer members, are responsible for the various activities of the association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aatcc.org/test/committees/|title=Research Committees - AATCC Online|work=AATCC Online|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three Interest Groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aatcc.org/mem/indiv/interestgroups/|title=AATCC Interest Groups - AATCC Online|work=AATCC Online|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; within AATCC:

The '''Chemical Applications''' '''Interest Group''' stimulates and expands its members' knowledge base of applying chemicals (preparation aids, colorants, finishes, polymers, etc.) to textile substrates. This includes the technologies, equipment, systems, and processes used, as well as the tested physical/mechanical properties of treated materials.

The '''Concept 2 Consumer&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''' '''(C2C) Interest Group''' focuses on the creation of textiles and textile-containing products, from design to retail. C2C activities promote the association to the retail, merchandising, and design communities to increase membership and participation in activities benefiting textile, apparel, and home fashions production.

The '''Materials''' '''Interest Group''' addresses the latest innovations in fibers and fiber products, including smart textiles, novel fibers, medical/biomedical, and protective textiles. Areas of interest include modifications of existing structures and the creation of unique chemical-, polymer-, and fiber-based materials. The Materials Interest Group concentrates on the science and engineering used to create new materials, along with any technologies, equipment, systems, and processes developed for their commercial production and their tested physical/mechanical properties.

==History==
AATCC was founded in 1921 by [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/Louis_Olney Dr. Louis Atwell Olney], professor, Lowell Technological Institute and other textile professionals in the Boston area (Massachusetts, USA). Since 1964, the association has been headquartered at the AATCC Technical Center in [[Research Triangle Park]], [[North Carolina]], USA. A complete history of AATCC (to 1996) is covered in the book ''Dyeing for a Living''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dyeing for a Living|last=Clark|first=Mark|publisher=AATCC|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Mark Clark and published by AATCC.

==Membership==
AATCC has individual, student, and corporate members in areas of the [[Textile|textile industry]] such as retail quality control, design, and merchandising; textile and apparel manufacturing; textile fiber, dye, chemical, instrument, and machinery manufacturing; testing labs; and academia.

'''Annual leave''' is [[paid time off]] work granted by [[employer]]s to [[employee]]s to be used for whatever the employee wishes. Depending on the employer's policies, differing number of days may be offered, and the employee may be required to give a certain amount of advance notice, may have to coordinate with the employer to be sure that staffing is adequately covered during the employee's absence, and other requirements may have to be met. The vast majority of countries today mandate a minimum amount of paid annual leave by law, though the United States is a notable exception in mandating no minimum paid leave and treating it as a perk rather than a right.

Most countries around the world have [[labour law]]s that mandate employers give a certain number of paid time-off days per year to workers. Canada requires at least two weeks (and at least three weeks for most workers in [[Saskatchewan]]);{{sfn|Ray|Sanes|Schmitt|2013|p=10}} in the European Union the countries can set freely the minimum, but it has to be at least equivalent to 4 working weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 93/104/EC |journal=Official Journal of the European Communities |date=23 November 1993 |volume=L 307 |page=20 |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31993L0104&amp;from=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full-time employment in Australia requires twenty annual leave days a year.{{sfn|Ray|Schmitt|2007|pp=1–3, 8}} US law does not require employers to grant any vacation or holidays, and about 25 per cent of all employees receive no paid vacation time or paid holidays.{{sfn|Ray|Schmitt|2007|p=1}}

According to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the United States, the average paid holidays for full-time employees in small private establishments in 1996 was 7.6 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=15 June 1998 |title=Employee Benefits in Small Private Industry Establishments, 1996 |url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ebs.nws.htm |location=Washington |publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics |access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the US Armed Forces earn 30 vacation days a year, not including national holidays.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Although the law does not mandate vacation time, many employers nonetheless offer paid vacation, typically around 10 work days in the private sector,{{sfn|Ray|Sanes|Schmitt|2013|p=1}} to attract employees. Under US federal law, employers usually must compensate terminated employees for accrued but unused vacation time. Additionally, many American employers provide paid days off for national holidays, such as [[Christmas]], [[New Year's Day]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], [[Memorial Day]], [[Labor Day]], and [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].

Some countries, such as [[Denmark]] and [[Italy]], or particular companies may mandate summer holidays in specific periods.

[[Argentina]] has different labour laws, for public employment and private employment. Public employees, have between a minimum of 21 days paid to 45 days paid for vacations (including holidays and weekends). Private employees have since 14 paid days to 28 paid days (including holidays and weekends). In both cases is always relying on the years of service. The more years the worker has the more days of paid vacation they will have.

===Consecutive holidays===
Consecutive holidays refers to holidays that occur in a group without [[working day]]s in between. In the late 1990s, the [[Japan]]ese government passed a law that increased the likelihood of consecutive holidays by moving holidays from fixed days to a relative position in a month, such as the second Monday.

'''Arthur Lehman Goodhart''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KBE|QC|FBA}} (1 March 1891 in New York City – 10 November 1978 in [[Oxford]]) was an American-born academic [[jurist]] and lawyer; he was [[Professor of Jurisprudence (University of Oxford)|Professor of Jurisprudence]] at the [[University of Oxford]], 1931–51, when he was also a Fellow of [[University College, Oxford]]. He was the first American to be the [[Master (college)|Master]] of an [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|Oxford college]], and was a significant benefactor to the College.&lt;ref name="darwall-smith08"&gt;{{cite book| last=Darwall-Smith | first=Robin | title=A History of University College, Oxford | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | date=2008 | isbn=978-0-19-928429-0 | chapter=The Great Benefactor: Arthur Goodhart | pages=485–491 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Arthur Goodhart was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family in New York City, the youngest of three children born to Harriet "Hattie" (née Lehman) and Philip Julius Goodhart.&lt;ref name=GoodhartQC&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/law/wps/WPS2010-01_Goodhart.pdf William Goodhart, QC]. Retrieved 2 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; His siblings were Howard Goodhart and Helen Goodhart Altschul (married to [[Frank Altschul]]). His maternal grandfather was [[Mayer Lehman]], one of three brothers who co-founded the investment banking firm [[Lehman Brothers]].&lt;ref name=GoodhartQC /&gt; Goodhart was educated at the [[Hotchkiss School]], [[Yale University]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. At Yale, he was an editor of campus humor magazine ''[[The Yale Record]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Yale Banner and Pot Pourri''. New Haven: Yale University Press. 1926. p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to the United States, he practised law until [[World War I]]. Following the war, he started to pursue an academic career in law, initially at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] and later at [[Oxford University]] where he became [[Professor of Jurisprudence (University of Oxford)|Professor of Jurisprudence]] and subsequently the Master of University College. He was editor of the ''[[Law Quarterly Review]]'' for fifty years.

==Career==
Rejected for service with British forces in [[World War I]], in 1914, Goodhart became a member of the U.S. forces when the U.S. joined the war in 1917; he became counsel to the U.S. mission to [[Poland]], in 1919.

Goodhart was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] by the [[Inner Temple]] 1919, and became a fellow of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], and university lecturer in jurisprudence; he edited the ''[[Cambridge Law Journal]]'', 1921–5, and the ''[[Law Quarterly Review]]'', 1926. In 1931 he moved to Oxford to become professor of jurisprudence. He gave up that chair when he became Master of [[University College, Oxford]], 1951–63. In 1952 he delivered the [[Hamlyn Lectures]].

As a member of the Law Revision Committee, Goodhart helped to promote improvements in various branches of the law.

==Personal life and legacy==
Arthur Goodhart was married to Cecily Goodhart (née Carter) who was of English heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/modern/goodhart/goodhart.html Catalogue of the papers of Arthur Lehman Goodhart (1891–1978): Biographical History" by Ruth Burchnall] University of Oxford, Bodleian Library 1993 |''In 1924 he married an English wife, Cecily Carter''&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children: [[Philip Goodhart|Sir Philip Goodhart]]; [[William Goodhart, Baron Goodhart|William Goodhart, Lord Goodhart of Youlbury]]; and [[Charles Goodhart]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=spOxzrifZjcC&amp;pg=PA354&amp;lpg=PA354&amp;dq=Charles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C7JuvV06NF&amp;sig=28edZ_ldJP1yHwgQTLENa93VlHE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAzgKahUKEwjmpJ6gmIvHAhUUQpIKHSrbBYU#v=onepage&amp;q=Charles%20A.E.%20Goodhart%20%20wife&amp;f=false The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History: "Arthur Lehman Goodhart" edited by William D. Rubinstein] p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; (after whom [[Goodhart's law]] is named).

'''BigChampagne''' is a technology-driven media measurement company. The BigChampagne dashboard is used primarily by music industry professionals such as concert promoters, venues, radio programmers, managers, agents, and marketers to access information about the popularity of artists and songs across radio airplay, online streaming, social activity, sales, and live events. BigChampagne provides a number of services related to producing [[business intelligence]] (BI) and [[competitive intelligence]] (CI) for users of the dashboard via access to proprietary data and data management (integration and analysis) combined with web applications and other technologies.

== Background ==
BigChampagne was co-founded by Eric Garland, Adam Toll, and Zachary Allison in 2000. The company was funded entirely by the founders, without outside capital. Musician [[Glen Phillips]] was an early adviser and supporter. The company's earliest service tracked the popularity of songs on the original Napster file-sharing service.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.10/fileshare.html?pg=2&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set=&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-founder Adam Toll has said that the company was named for a lyric in the [[Peter Tosh]] song [[Downpressor Man#Peter Tosh and the Wailers versions|"Downpressor Man"]]: "You drink your big champagne and laugh."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.10/fileshare.html?pg=1&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set=&lt;/ref&gt;

BigChampagne has courted some controversy; the company's early focus on Napster and other file sharing networks originally discouraged major music companies from working with them. In 2003, founder Eric Garland testified before the California State Senate that online file sharing was "fundamentally unstoppable." The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] publicly criticized his remarks. Beginning in 2002 BigChampagne was involved in a lawsuit with a company called Webspins. Both companies alleged defamation and unfair business practices. The suit was settled out of court in 2003 but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Also in 2003, Altnet, a distribution partner of file sharing service Kazaa, sent legal threats to BigChampagne and eight other companies alleging patent infringement. BigChampagne was dropped from the list of targeted companies almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.10/fileshare.html?pg=2&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set=&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/business/soa/UPDATE-Altnet-warns-companies-against-alleged-patent-infringement/0,139023166,120280887,00.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Electronic Frontier Foundation hoped to use the record industry's relationship with BigChampagne to defend file sharing networks like [[Kazaa]] as they believed using the networks for market information constituted a non-infringing use of the networks.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.10/fileshare.html?pg=1&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set=&lt;/ref&gt; This defense proved unsuccessful.

Data provided by BigChampagne is used by companies to help make decisions about signing artists and promoting music online and to radio stations; broadcasters use BigChampagne to inform playlist decisions. [[Led Zeppelin]] used BigChampagne to choose songs for a 2007 reunion "with good results."&lt;ref&gt;http://mcvaymediarocks.blogspot.com/2009/10/taking-music-risks.html&lt;/ref&gt; BigChampagne also collaborated with [[Radiohead]] to assess the impact of the band's pay-what-you-wish album [[In Rainbows]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/2009/11/the_in_rainbows_experiment_did.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, BigChampagne contributed data and analysis to [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] editor-in-chief [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] and was featured in ''[[The New York Times]]'' best-seller [[Long Tail|"The Long Tail: Why the Future Business is Selling Less of More"]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=O2k0K1w_bJIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20long%20tail%20by%20chris%20anderson&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=big%20champagne&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

BigChampagne's metrics and analysis have been cited by media outlets including ''The New York Times'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Financial Times|The Financial Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', and [[National Public Radio]] (NPR).

In 2011, BigChampagne was acquired by [[Live Nation Entertainment]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204026804577099462543006018&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently part of OnTour with Ticketmaster.

==Business Model==
BigChampagne generates revenue from dashboard subscription fees and consulting fees. The company is primarily a [[Business-to-business|"B2B"]], selling information "business-to-business," though some aspects of BigChampagne's data and analysis are available to the general public.  The company's business model is similar to the [[Bloomberg Terminal]], [[Omniture]], or a number of [[Nielsen Company]] products and services.

'''Bill Coffin''' is a writer of novels and [[role-playing games]] in the [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] genres. Perhaps best known for his work at [[Palladium Books]] from July 1998 through May 2002, he made significant contributions to several of Palladium's game series, most notably ''[[Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game|Palladium Fantasy]]'', but also ''[[Heroes Unlimited]]'' and ''[[Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts]]'', and created his own game, ''[[Systems Failure]]''.

==Career==
Bill Coffin is a well-received author who made many books for [[Palladium Books]] from 1988-2002.&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|196}} He was a contributor to ''[[Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game|Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing]]'' and ''[[Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts]]''.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|162}}  In his post-apocalyptic game ''[[Systems Failure]]'' (1999), [[Y2K]] was real.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|161}} However, due to a conflict with [[Kevin Siembieda]], the president and co-founder of Palladium Books, Coffin left the company, much to the disappointment of his fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=1450252 | title = Thread: What's up with Palladium and BTS? | author = User: Bill Coffin | date = September 23, 2003 &lt;!-- , 10:15pm EDT --&gt;  | work = [[RPGnet]] tabletop roleplaying forum | publisher = [[Skotos|Skotos Tech]] | location = [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley, CA]] | at = Post 227 | accessdate = July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffin was let go by Siembieda due to editorial differences and general discontent with the ''Rifts Coalition Wars'' (which Siembieda and Coffin had co-authored).&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|162}} At the time of his departure, Coffin was the lead author of six titles in the final stages of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = W. |date=April 2002 | journal = The Rifter | issue = 18 | pages = 10–13, 15 | publisher = [[Palladium Books]] | location = [[Taylor, Michigan|Taylor, MI]] | isbn = 978-1-57457-071-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently demoted to second- and third-author status on two of these books prior to their release,&lt;ref&gt;''Palladium Fantasy RPG—Land of the Damned Two: Eternal Torment'' and ''Wolfen Empire Adventure Sourcebook'' (formerly ''Adventures in the Northern Wilderness, Second Edition'') – {{cite journal | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = W. |date=July 2002 | journal = The Rifter | issue = 19 | page = 11 | publisher = Palladium Books | location = Taylor, MI | isbn = 978-1-57457-076-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other four were ultimately shelved and have not been rescheduled for publication.&lt;ref&gt;''Rifts Dimension Book Six: Cosmo-Knights'' (final advertisement) – {{cite journal | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = W. |date=July 2002 | journal = The Rifter | issue = 19 | pages = 13, 17 | publisher = Palladium Books | location = Taylor, MI | isbn = 978-1-57457-076-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''RECON: Modern Combat'' (final advertisement) – {{cite journal | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = W. |date=October 2002 | journal = The Rifter | issue = 20 | pages = 8, 13 | publisher = Palladium Books | location = Taylor, MI | isbn = 978-1-57457-077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hardware/Gizmos Unlimited: A Heroes Unlimited Sourcebook'' (final advertisement) – {{cite journal | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = W. |date=April 2003 | journal = The Rifter | issue = 22 | page = 96 | publisher = Palladium Books | location = Taylor, MI | isbn = 978-1-57457-081-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Palladium Fantasy RPG—Land of the Damned Three: The Bleakness'' (final advertisement) – {{cite journal | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = W. |date=July 2004 | journal = The Rifter | issue = 35 | page = 29C | publisher = Palladium Books | location = Taylor, MI | isbn = 978-1-57457-167-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, having only received limited support from Palladium, ''Systems Failure'' has since gone out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stott | first1 = R. | last2 = Merrow | first2 = S. | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = W |date=January 2004 | title = Questions &amp; Answers | journal = The Rifter | issue = 25 | page = 92 | publisher = Palladium Books | location = Taylor, MI | isbn = 978-1-57457-098-4 | lastauthoramp = y | quote = Though adventures and source-material for it appear in ''The Rifter'' from time to time, the line is dead and the RPG will eventually go out of print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, it was revealed that Coffin was working on ''Septimus'', a new [[campaign setting]] for the ''[[D6 Space]]'' core book for [[West End Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?316358 | title = Thread: Bill Coffin Returns With New D6 Game | author = User: hellsreach | date = March 12, 2007 &lt;!-- , 7:07pm EDT --&gt;  | work = RPGnet tabletop roleplaying forum | publisher = Skotos Tech | location = Berkeley, CA | accessdate = July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to financial concerns, the publisher cancelled the project in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?387260 | title = Thread: Bill Coffin's ''Septimus'' Cancelled | author = User: trechiron | date = March 31, 2008 &lt;!-- , 2:15pm EDT --&gt;  | work = RPGnet tabletop roleplaying forum | publisher = Skotos Tech | location = Berkeley, CA | accessdate = July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Coffin declared that he would release the game as a PDF under [[Evil Hat Productions]]' ''[[FATE (role-playing game system)|FATE]]'' system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=8910813 | title = Thread: Bill Coffin's ''Septimus'' Cancelled | author = User: Bill Coffin | date = May 22, 2008 &lt;!-- , 9:48pm EDT --&gt;  | work = RPGnet tabletop roleplaying forum | publisher = Skotos Tech | location = Berkeley, CA | at = Post 193 | accessdate = July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=8913692 | title = Thread: Bill Coffin's ''Septimus'' Cancelled | author = User: Bill Coffin | date = May 23, 2008 &lt;!-- , 12:10pm EDT --&gt;  | work = RPGnet tabletop roleplaying forum | publisher = Skotos Tech | location = Berkeley, CA | at = Post 208 | accessdate = July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, West End Games announced that they had agreed to publish ''Septimus'' again and that it would be released August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?453411 | title = Thread: Bill Coffin's ''Septimus'' coming out August 2009, apparently | author = User: Kai Tave | date = May 17, 2009 &lt;!-- , 10:00pm EDT --&gt;  | work = RPGnet tabletop roleplaying forum | publisher = Skotos Tech | location = Berkeley, CA | accessdate = July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric J.

A '''bill of materials''' or '''product structure''' (sometimes '''bill of material''', '''BOM''' or '''associated list''') is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts, and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an [[Product (business)|end product]]. A BOM may be used for communication between manufacturing partners or confined to a single manufacturing plant. A bill of materials is often tied to a [[production order]] whose issuance may generate reservations for components in the bill of materials that are in stock and [[requisition]]s for components that are not in stock.

A BOM can define products as they are designed ([[engineering bill of materials]]), as they are ordered (sales bill of materials), as they are built ([[manufacturing bill of materials]]), or as they are maintained (service bill of materials). The different types of BOMs depend on the business need and use for which they are intended. In [[process industries]], the BOM is also known as the '''formula''', '''recipe''', or '''ingredients list'''. The phrase "bill of material" (or "BOM") is frequently used by engineers as an adjective to refer not to the literal bill, but to the current production configuration of a product, to distinguish it from modified or improved versions under study or in test.

Sometimes the term "pseudo-bill of materials" or "pseudo-BOM" is used to refer to a more flexible or simplified version. Often a place-holder part number is used to represent a group of related (usually standard) parts that have common attributes and are interchangeable in the context of this BOM.&lt;ref name="Pseudo-BOM"/&gt;

In electronics, the BOM represents the list of components used on the printed wiring board or printed circuit board. Once the design of the circuit is completed, the BOM list is passed on to the [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] layout engineer as well as the component engineer who will procure the components required for the design.

==Modular BOM==
BOMs are of [[Directed acyclic graph|hierarchical nature]], with the top level representing the finished product which may be a sub-assembly or a completed item. BOMs that describe the sub-assemblies are referred to as '''modular BOMs'''. An example of this is the NAAMS BOM that is used in the automotive industry to list all the components in an assembly line. The structure of the NAAMS BOM is System, Line, Tool, Unit and Detail.

The first hierarchical databases were developed for automating bills of materials for manufacturing organizations in the early 1960s. At present, this BOM is used as a data base to identify the many parts and their codes in automobile manufacturing companies.

A bill of materials "implosion" links component pieces to a major assembly, while a bill of materials "explosion" breaks apart each assembly or sub-assembly into its component parts.

A modular BOM can be displayed in the following formats:
* A single-level BOM that displays the assembly or sub-assembly with only one level of children. Thus it displays the components directly needed to make the assembly or sub-assembly.&lt;ref name="Drouillard_2001"/&gt;
* An indented BOM that displays the highest-level item closest to the left margin and the components used in that item indented more to the right.&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt;
* Modular (planning) BOM

A BOM can also be visually represented by a product structure tree, although they are rarely used in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; For example, one of them is Time-Phased Product Structure&lt;ref name="Malakooti_2013"/&gt; where this diagram illustrates the time needed to build or acquire the needed components to assemble the final product. For each product, the time phased product structure shows the sequence and duration of each operation.

=={{anchor|CBOM}}Configurable BOM==
A '''configurable bill of materials''' (CBOM) is a form of BOM used by industries that have multiple options and highly [[product configuration|configurable products]] (e.g. telecom systems, data-center hardware (SANS, servers, etc.), PCs, cars).&lt;ref name="Super_BOM"/&gt;

The CBOM is used to dynamically create "end-items" that a company sells. The benefit of using CBOM structure is that it reduces the work-effort needed to maintain product structures. The configurable BOM is most frequently driven by "configurator" software, however it can be enabled manually (manual maintenance is infrequent because it is unwieldy to manage the number of permutations and combinations of possible configurations). The development of the CBOM is dependent on having a [[modular BOM]] structure in place.  The modular BOM structure provides the assemblies/sub-systems that can be selected to "configure" an end-item.

While most configurators utilize top-down hierarchical rules syntax to find appropriate modular BOMs, maintenance of very similar BOMs (i.e., only one component is different for various voltages) becomes highly excessive.  A newer approach, (bottom-up/rules-based structuring) utilizing a proprietary search engine scheme transversing through selectable componentry at high speeds eliminates the planning modular BOM duplications.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The search engine is also used for all combinatorial feature constraints and GUI representations to support specification selections.

{{anchor|Assembly variant}}To decide which assembly variant of the parts or components is to be chosen, they are attributed by the product options which are the characteristic features of the [[product (business)|product]]. If the options of the product build an ideal [[Boolean algebra]],&lt;ref name="Herlyn001"/&gt; it is possible to describe the connection between parts and product variants with a Boolean expression, which refers to a subset of the set of products.&lt;ref name="Herlyn002"/&gt;

{{anchor|DNP}}Parts which will not be assembled at all in one or more variants are typically marked as "DNP" (for "do not populate" or "do not place") in the affected variants. Other less frequently used designators for this include "NP" ("no placement", "not placed"), "DNM" ("do not mount"), "NM" ("not mounted"), "DNI" ("do not install"), "DNE" ("do not equip"), "DNA" ("do not assemble"), "DNS" ("do not stuff"), "NOFIT" etc.

==Multi-level BOM==
A multi-level bill of materials (BOM), referred to as an indented BOM, is a bill of materials that lists the assemblies, components, and parts required to make a product in a parent-child, top-down method. It provides a display of all items that are in parent-children relationships. When an item is a sub-component, of a (parent) component, it can in-turn have its own child components, and so on. The resulting top-level BOM (item number) would include children; a mix of finished sub-assemblies, various parts and raw materials. A multi-level structure can be illustrated by a tree with several levels. In contrast, a single-level structure only consists of one level of children in components, assemblies and material.

'''Bowman Gray Stadium''' is a [[NASCAR]] sanctioned {{convert|1/4|mi|adj=on}} asphalt flat oval [[Short track motor racing|short track]] and longstanding [[American football|football]] stadium located in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]. It is one of stock car racing's most legendary venues, and is referred to as "NASCAR's longest-running weekly race track". Bowman Gray Stadium is part of the [[Winston-Salem Sports and Entertainment Complex]] and is home of the [[Winston-Salem State University]] Rams football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zona| first=Chris|author2=Trevin Goodwin| title= 2007 Rams Football| url=http://www.fansonly.com/photos/schools/wssu/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2007FBMGComplete.pdf| publisher=Winston-Salem State Athletics |year= 2007|page = 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the home of the [[Wake Forest University]] football team from 1956 until [[Groves Stadium]] (later [[BB&amp;T Field]]) opened in 1968.  Bowman Gray Stadium was a popular venue for high school football in the 1970s and 1980s.  Parkland and R.J. Reynolds High Schools shared Bowman Gray Stadium as their home field for high school football until the two schools built their own facility (Deaton-Thompson Stadium) in 1994.

==History==
The stadium was built in 1937 as a public works project to provide jobs during the Great Depression. The first event at the new stadium was a football game in the fall of 1938 between [[Wake Forest College]] and [[Duke University]]. In the beginning, the stadium's sole use was for collegiate football until trotter horse racing was added on the .250-mile dirt oval. The first auto racing at Bowman Gray was a type of midget auto racing on the dirt quarter mile track from 1939-1949. The track was paved in 1947, after a promoter got the City of Winston-Salem to agree to pay to have the track paved in exchange for restitution of payments through a percentage of future income from races. However, after the track was paved the promoter fled before any payments were made to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Richard |date=2013 |title=Bowman Gray Stadium |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |pages=7–12 |isbn=978-0738599182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stock car racing at Bowman Gray Stadium was started by Bill France Sr. and Alvin Hawkins, two men who were founding fathers of NASCAR. The track was NASCAR's very first weekly track. The track would run weekly NASCAR sanctioned events during the summer months.

The first [[NASCAR]]-sanctioned event took place on May 18, 1949, and was won by [[Fonty Flock]].&lt;ref name="NascarHomeTracks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hometracks.nascar.com/Feature/30_Years_Running/Bowman_Gray|title=A LOOK BACK: Bowman Gray|publisher=hometracks.nascar.com|accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track was opened by [[NASCAR]] founder [[Bill France Sr.]] and Alvin Hawkins, and remains operated by members of the Hawkins family to this day.&lt;ref name="hometracks.nascar.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Getty Images for NASCAR |url=http://hometracks.nascar.com/nwaas/story/bowman-gray-set-special-night_08142015 |title=Bowman Gray Set For Special Night &amp;#124; NASCAR Home Tracks |publisher=Hometracks.nascar.com |date=2015-08-14 |accessdate=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the inaugural Bowman Gray season 11 races had been run and five more were rained out. [[Tim Flock]] won the track championship with a season that included four wins.

As the racing had become extremely popular at the track an additional of seating 7,000 seats were built connecting the east and west grandstands in 1953. It raised the seating capacity from 10,000 to 17,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Richard |date=2013 |title=Bowman Gray Stadium |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |page=14 |isbn=978-0738599182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The track has hosted many different series through the years, including The Grand National Series (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series), NASCAR Convertible Division, NASCAR Late Model Short Track Division, NASCAR Grand American Series, Dash Series, NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour, NASCAR Late Model Sportsman Division (now Xfinity Series) and NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series.&lt;ref name="Miller 2013 8"&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Richard |date=2013 |title=Bowman Gray Stadium |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |page=8 |isbn=978-0738599182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Grand National event took place in 1958 and it was won by [[Bob Welborn]].&lt;ref name="RacingReferenceTrackResults" /&gt; Other winners include [[Glen Wood]], [[Rex White]], [[David Pearson (racing driver)|David Pearson]], [[Richard Petty]], [[Bobby Allison]], [[Junior Johnson]] and [[Marvin Panch]].&lt;ref name="RacingReferenceTrackResults"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/tracks?id=085|title=Bowman Gray Stadium NASCAR results|publisher=Racing-Reference|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Petty won his 100th race at the track. The Grand National Series first raced at the track in 1958 and hosted a total of 29 Grand National races through 1971.

Motorcycle races were run on a temporary dirt track at the stadium in 1970 and 1971. The stock car races were run first in the events before construction crews would lay dirt down during an intermission for motorcycles races the same night.&lt;ref name="Miller 2013 8"/&gt;

Bowman Gray's nickname, the "Madhouse," is largely attributed to the racing antics that take place on the tight, quarter mile bull ring. In 2014, Bowman Gray's promoter, Gray Garrison described the events at BGS as part racing, part religion, and part wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted 10:47 pm, July 23, 2014, by Neill McNeill |url=http://myfox8.com/2014/07/23/newsmakers-bowman-gray-promoter-gray-garrison/ |title=Newsmakers: Bowman Gray promoter Gray Garrison |publisher=myfox8.com |date=2014-07-23 |accessdate=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this is partially the reason for the nickname, it actually originated from a qualifying format the track used in the 1950s called the "mad scramble." &lt;ref name="hometracks.nascar.com"/&gt;

In 2015, Bowman Gray celebrated its 1,000th NASCAR sanctioned race &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jay Spivey/Winston-Salem Journal |url=http://www.journalnow.com/sports/auto_racing/bowman_gray/races-bowman-gray-to-reach-nascar-milestone-saturday/article_63ec8a64-420b-11e5-b990-b7b57a0d9904.html |title=1,000 Races: Bowman Gray to reach NASCAR milestone Saturday - Winston-Salem Journal: Bowman Gray |publisher=Journalnow.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2018, it was announced that the Stadium would get a $9 Million renovation. It will begin in 2019, with construction starting in 2020 and ending in 2022. It will include new restrooms, a track resurface, and a new name for the football field entitled "Rams Field At Bowman Gray". &lt;ref name=journalnow&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.journalnow.com/sports/auto_racing/bowman_gray/new-deal-brings-million-in-bowman-gray-stadium-improvements-keeps/article_0fdd62ab-535d-5744-a601-e05b397615f9.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, the track features four divisions: the [[Modified stock car racing|modifieds]], sportsman, street stock and stadium stock. The modifieds are the featured division at Bowman Gray, the division started in 1949 and the all-time wins list features some of the best NASCAR drivers including [[Lee Petty]], [[Ralph Earnhardt]], [[Ned Jarrett]], [[Richie Evans]], and [[Jerry Cook]].

The football history of the stadium is also quite storied. Wake Forest University played home games in the stadium from its move to Winston-Salem in 1956, until the 1968 season when Groves Stadium (now [[BB&amp;T Field]]) opened. Players such as [[Brian Piccolo]], the 1964 ACC Player of the Year who led the nation in rushing and scoring, played his home games in Bowman Gray. Piccolo  later became famous as the teammate of Gale Sayers with the Chicago Bears, and the subject of the 1971 film ''[[Brian's Song]]''. The Winston-Salem high schools of R.J.Reynolds High and Parkland High also played their home games at the stadium in the late 1960s through the 1980s.

==Today==

Bowman Gray's weekly racing tradition continues as part of the [[Whelen All-American Series]], with races Saturday evenings from the end of April through August.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bowmangrayracing.com/fans.html Fan Information]." Retrieved on May 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The track can seat 17,000 people in the stands, with an additional 2,000 standing-room around the wall above the seating areas. The weekly races during the year normally have an average attendance between 12,000 and 15,000 per night. Many events are standing room only, as some events have had estimated crowds of more than 23,000 show up.&lt;ref name="Miller 2013 8"/&gt;

Weekly races include the modified, sportsman, street stock and stadium stock divisions. Bowman Gray is also a part of the special events including classic modified coupes and East Coast Flathead Ford Racing Association (ECFFRA), [[monster trucks]], [[Demolition derby|demolition derbies]], chain races, skid races and INEX [[Legends car racing|Legends Car]] and [[Bandolero racing|bandolero]] races. The [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] show ''[[MadHouse (TV Show)|MadHouse]]'' was taped at the track during the 2009 season. The showed aired in January 2010 and ran through April 2010. On October 29, 2018, a new show entitled "Race Night At Bowman Gray" will air on [[Discovery Channel]]. The show will focus on the Modified Division. After the first few episodes, the show was moved to the Discovery Go App and [[Motor Trend (TV network)]], after fear of cancellation.

Spectators listen to the officials during the races on frequencies 461.200&amp;nbsp;MHz, 463.625&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 466.600&amp;nbsp;MHz on a scanner or "race radio." Many, if not all of the drivers also communicate via a two-way radio during the race. Most of them use a frequency between 450-470&amp;nbsp;MHz, but there are exceptions.

Modified and sportsman car counts were thin during the latter part of the 1950s and the track combined the two and let the V6s run with the V8s and named it the "Modified-Sportsman Division".  Leading into the 1968 season, the track dropped the sportsman cars and title, hence officially named the featured division as the modifieds.

The Amateur Division was the support division to the modified-sportsman and ran from 1950 to mid-1958, where the division dissolved and the track picked up the Hobby Division.

The Claiming Division was tabbed as a third weekly division in 1964. It was a division that cost only $99 to run, it was so popular that the track had to cut the fields down to two races with ten cars apiece. The division ran from 1964 to 1972. The track changed the name to what is now the Sportsman Division.

The Hobby Division, which was the predecessor of the Street Stock Division, ran from mid-1958 to 1974. Then the following year, the division was renamed to the street stock.

Bowman Gray ran Blunderbust races as a fourth division from 1977-1989 until they replaced that division with the Buzzbomber Division in 1990. The following season, the track kept the cars, but changed the division to what is now the Stadium Stock Division.

'''Carl Johan Korsman''' (14 June 1829 — 24 May 1907) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[shipowner]] and [[military officer]].

Korsman joined in the military in 1846; he served in [[infantry]] and resigned in 1868 as [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]].

In 1869 Korsman started [[Ship transport|shipping]] business first in coastal shipping, later in liner shipping operating from [[Turku]] to [[Stockholm]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]. He became a significant operator in 1878 when he started winter season shipping between [[Hanko]] and Stockholm. Korsman laid the basis to the Finnish winter season shipping together with [[Sea captain|captain]] [[August Alexander Granroth]].

Korsman founded also Vätti techno-chemical factory and [[engineering]] company ''Åbo Mekaniska Verkstads Ab''. He developed the Hanko [[spa]] the most prominent in [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]].

Korsman retired in 1895 and moved to [[Helsinki]], where he died in 1907.

== Early years ==
Korsman was born in [[Pyhämaa]], [[Finland Proper]]. His parents were [[vicar]] of [[Merikarvia]] Johan Jacob Korsman and Amalia Carolina [[née]] Achander. Korsman studied six years in [[Pori]] [[Trivial school (Sweden and Finland)|trivial school]], after which he went to [[military]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Carl Korsman"/&gt;

== Military career ==
Korsman started his military career in [[Finnish Rifle Battalion]] in which he served as junior [[non-commissioned officer]] in 1846–1849, [[Unteroffiziere mit Portepee|Fähnrich with Portepee]] in 1849–1851 and [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in 1851–1852. After this he was relocated to Finnish Grenadier Rifle battalion; he became [[sub-lieutenant]] in 1853 and in 1855 he was promoted [[lieutenant]]. In 1856 Korsman became company commander in Turku Rifle Battalion. He became first [[Stabskapitän|staff captain]] and in 1868 he became [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]]. Korsman left the military in the same year.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Carl Korsman"/&gt;

== Shipping ==
In 1868 Korsman started trading [[firewood]] in [[Turku]], but already in the following year he moved to a new line of business: Korsman bought a screw-propeller [[Steamship|steamer]] named ''Ahkera'' and started liner shipping between Turku and [[Salo, Finland|Salo]]. In the 1870s he expanded from coastal shipping to liner shipping between Turku and [[Stockholm]], and cargo shipping in the [[Baltic Sea]]. Korsman aimed to use the latest technology and to increase the capacity. In 1874 Korsman founded shipping company ''Ångfartygsaktiebolaget Åbo'' to operate between Stockholm and [[Saint Petersburg]] by steamship ''Åbo'', which was the largest steamship built in Finland until then.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Carl Korsman"/&gt;

A company called ''Finska Transito-ångbåtsaktiebolaget'' had started winter season operation between [[Hanko]] and Stockholm in 1876 by 298-tonne ''S/S Express''. Due to unprofitable summer season operation the company [[Bankruptcy|bankrupted]] in 1878. The state regarded a year-round operation to [[Sweden]] highly important, and sought for successor for the operation. Korsman saw the potential of steam shipping for wintertime operation, and rented the ship from the state which had [[Confiscation|confiscated]] it due to outstanding payments. He moved to Hanko and recruited [[Sea captain|captain]] [[August Alexander Granroth]] to master the ship. ''Express'' sailed weekly between Stockholm and Hanko between 15 November and 15 May. Out of total 303 journeys planned during 1878–1889, 242 were successful despite of difficult ice conditions at times. Korsman played with a high risk, because no a [[marine insurance]] company agreed giving an insurance to a such operation; on the other hand, the [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]] and city of Stockholm supported him financially.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Carl Korsman"/&gt;

During the 1880s the number of passengers grew and in addition to [[mail]] delivery, Korsman exported Finnish [[butter]] and [[paper]] to the Swedish and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] market. Korsman and captain Granroth created the basis for the Finnish winter shipping, and Hanko became the centre of it. In 1889 the state organised a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[icebreaker]] to ease manoeuvring in ice and in the following year the first state-owned icebreaker started in service. Korsman planned to grow his business and buy another ship alongside the ''Express'' which he had earlier purchased from the state, but gave up with the plan due to health reasons. He built a four-floor house in Helsinki, close to [[South Harbour, Helsinki|South Harbour]] in 1895.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Carl Korsman"/&gt;

== Other businesses ==
Korsman was founder and manager of Vätti techno-chemical factory started in 1872. In 1874 he took part at founding [[engineering]] company ''Åbo Mekaniska Verkstads Ab'' and became its manager.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Carl Korsman"/&gt;

During 1880–1890 Korsman was the manager of Hanko [[spa]], which developed the most significant spa of Finland during his leadership.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Carl Korsman"/&gt;

== Positions of trust ==
Korsman took part in many municipal positions of trust both in Turku and Hanko. He was chairman of Hanko [[town council]] in 1890–1891. During 1885–1889 Korsman participated in three committees which aimed developing the Finnish seafaring.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Carl Korsman"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1854 Korsman married Isabella Charlotta née Ramsell (1832–1907). The couple got 12 children in 1855–1875; ten of them lived until adulthood.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Carl Korsman"/&gt;

'''Co-counselling''' (spelled '''co-counseling''' in [[American and British English spelling differences|American English]]) is a grassroots method of personal change based on reciprocal peer counselling. It uses simple methods. Time is shared equally and the essential requirement of the person taking their turn in the role of counsellor is to do their best to listen and give their full attention to the other person.  It is not a discussion; the aim is to support the person in the client role to work through their own issues in a mainly self-directed way.

Co-counselling was originally formulated in the early 1950s by the American [[Harvey Jackins]] and originated in a [[schism]] in the [[Dianetics]] movement (itself in part derived from schisms in [[General Semantics]] and [[Cybernetics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "[http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/articles/terra/ Terra Incognita: The Mind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204155459/http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/articles/terra/ |date=2006-02-04 }}," ''The Explorers Journal'', winter 1949 / spring 1950 (on the bridge between cybernetics and general semantics)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/soho/studios/8215/dia.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:56:00 Rich's Home Page - ''Comparison of Re-evaluation Counseling Terms and concepts with Dianetics'']&lt;/ref&gt; Jackins founded the [[Re-evaluation Counseling]] (RC) Communities, with headquarters in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[United States]]. His son, [[Tim Jackins]], is currently the international leader of Re-evaluation Counseling and its main affiliates.

There are a number of smaller, separate, independent organizations that have resulted from breakaways from, or re-workings of, Re-evaluation Counseling. The principal one of these is [[Co-Counselling International|Co-Counseling International]] (CCI).

==General description==
The main activity in co-counselling involves participants arranging to meet regularly in pairs to give each other peer-to-peer counselling, in turn taking the role of counsellor and client, with equal amounts of time allocated to each. Co-counselling functions by giving people an opportunity to work on whatever issues they choose with the accepting support of another person, with whom they have no actual relationship. The person in the role of counsellor acts as a facilitator to the client, sometimes as a third-party observer and sometimes as a second-party confidant. While co-counselling is sometimes practiced outside a formal organisation, formal co-counselling organisations have developed leadership and support structures, including trainings and retreats.

Safety (in the sense of being very low risk) and the sense that a co-counselling session is a safe space is important to the methods.  There are strict rules of [[confidentiality]]. In most circumstances, the counsellor may not talk about a client's session without explicit and specific permission by the client. This is stricter than in other practices where practitioners discuss clients with supervisors, colleagues and sometimes with all sorts of other people.  The peer [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] makes a considerable contribution to a sense of trust.

The nature of the co-counselling session opens up the possibility for people to get in touch with [[emotion]]s that they would avoid in any other circumstance.  A belief in the value of working with emotions has become a core focus of the approach.  Co-counselling training emphasizes methods for accessing and working with emotions, and co-counsellors aim to develop and improve [[emotional competence]] through the practice. Evidence as to the actual effectiveness of this method is undemonstrated.

To get involved in co-counselling, it is usually first necessary to complete a Fundamentals course. The training involves learning how to carry out the roles of client and counsellor. Trainers may be counsellors or simply experienced members of the community.  It also covers the guidelines or rules affecting co-counselling for the particular organization. Differences in approach mean that each organization normally requires completion of one of its own courses as a prerequisite for membership, even if someone has already completed a course with another organization.

==Theoretical framework and assumptions==
The original [[theory]] of co-counselling centres on the concept of distress patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Jackins, Harvey (1965); ''The human side of human beings''; Rational Island, Seattle; {{ISBN|0-911214-60-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are patterns of [[behaviour]], that is, behaviour that tends to be repeated in a particular type of circumstance, that are irrational, unhelpful or compulsive. The theory is that these patterns are driven by the accumulated consequences in the [[mind]] of (not currently) conscious [[Memory|memories]] of past events in which the person was unable to express or discharge the emotion appropriate to the event. Co-counselling enables release from the patterns by allowing "emotional discharge" of the past hurt experiences. Such cathartic discharge includes crying, warm perspiration, trembling, yawning, laughing and relaxed, non-repetitive talking. In day-to-day life, these "discharging" actions may be limited by social norms, such as, for example, taboos around crying, which are widespread in many [[culture]]s.

Having temporary, undivided, supportive attention from another person often gives rise to strong feelings towards that person; your counsellor often becomes your best friend for life. Sometimes people "fall in love" with each other. This is similar to the phenomenon of [[transference]], particularly when one of the partners is felt to have more authority because, for instance, they are more experienced, are teachers of co-counselling, or have authority roles within the organisation. The organisations differ in the ways that they handle this. The inability to trust and feel in real relationships is sometimes exacerbated by the intimacy of co-counselling relationship, making transference a possibility. But participants are strongly encouraged and supported to counsel through these feelings, often leading to profound changes in their perspectives and abilities around closeness. For the most part, co-counselling relationships become life-long, therapeutic partnerships that enable the participant to have healthier relationships in general.

==Therapeutic context==
Many co-counsellors take the view, often quite strongly, that co-counselling is not psychotherapy.  In the beginning, this was because Re-evaluation Counseling decided not to draw on any discipline of psychotherapy for its theory and practice,&lt;ref&gt;Jackins, Harvey (1997); ''The list''; Rational Island, Seattle (p4, 1.019)&lt;/ref&gt; although RC did incorporate some ideas from psycho-analysis such as "unconscious promptings" which Jackins adapted and relabeled "restimulation".  A similar view is taken by some non-RC co-counsellors who regard psychotherapy as involving specialist techniques used by a therapist on a client and is therefore not peer and the client has little or no control over the process.&lt;ref&gt;Pyves, Gretchen (2000); [http://www.co-cornucopia.org.uk/coco/articles/therapy1.htm ''Co-Counseling versus Counseling''] accessed 2006-11-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Others consider that co-counselling is psychotherapeutic, in that it enables change or therapy to take place in the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], [[soul]] affect or being of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Evison, Rose &amp; Horobin, Richard  (1999); ''Co-Counseling as Therapy''; Co-Counseling Phoenix, Pitlochrie; available at [http://www.co-cornucopia.org.uk/coco/articles/cocother/index.html] accessed 2006-11-24&lt;/ref&gt; Co-counselling takes a positive view of the person (i.e. we are all essentially good), considers the mind and body as an integrated whole and acknowledges the value of catharsis; it is regarded as an approach within [[humanistic psychology]], a view that would be rejected by some within RC. &lt;ref&gt;Jackins, Harvey (1980); [https://www.rc.org/publication/books/br/br_459_hj ''The Working Class, the World, and RC''] accessed 2015-11-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-evaluation Counseling==
{{Main|Re-evaluation Counseling}}

The core organization structure of RC consists of classes and local communities set up by experienced co-counsellors, which are in turn organized by regions and country.

The term "re-evaluation" refers to the client's need to rethink their past distress experiences after the [[emotion]]al hurt in those experiences have been discharged, and thereby regain ("re-emerge" with) their natural [[Intelligence|intellectual]] and emotional capacities.  The RC organization and literature do not accept the description of its practice as [[psychotherapy]], maintaining instead that the process of developing distress patterns that dissolve through emotional discharge in the context of appreciative attention is simply a natural process that does not imply either psychopathology on the part of the individual or the need for professional treatment. Re-evaluation Counseling regards other forms of "mainstream counselling" and psychotherapy in general as frequently inadequate attempts to bring about relief from distress using methods that do not focus on discharge and re-emergence.

In RC, the client and counsellor are expected to work co-operatively, participants are expected to provide non-judgmental active listening and to "contradict" the misinformation or other conditions thought to be associated with distress patterns. RC also engages techniques such as "non-permissive" counselling, in which the counsellor intervenes to "interrupt" client patterns without the consent of the client. The structure of RC is one of clearly defined leadership, to encourage clarity in the difficult struggles many people have to achieve breakthroughs against their distresses. RC encourages counsellors to think very hard about all possible ways to assist the client in discharging.

RC approaches the issue of feelings between co-counsellors by having a strict "no-socialising" rule. RC co-counsellors are expected not to socialise or have social or [[Intimate relationship|sexual relationships]] with other co-counsellors unless these [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] pre-dated their becoming co-counsellors.  RC specifically rejects the label "transference" for this phenomenon, as this is seen as part of a "symptomatic" method typical in [[psychology]]; the original theory of co-counselling (from RC) teaches that the best thing to do in these circumstances is repeatedly counsel on, and "discharge" about, such feelings. In addition, methods of "getting attention out of distress" are available which help with the difficulty of "switching roles" between counsellor and client. When taught correctly, counsellors are soon able to grasp the difference between counselling relationships and those from outside life. However, sometimes there is a marked pull to "socialise" or confuse the boundaries of the co-counselling relationship with other types of relationships. This is one reason why many consider a well-organised community of co-counsellors with clear rules to be essential in the successful practise of co-counselling.

Re-evaluation Counseling places a high importance on the need to understand and adhere to a comprehensive theory about the nature of the universe and of human beings (known in general as the "Benign Reality"), the best ways of assisting the discharge process and of pro-liberation attitudes in co-counselling. RCers believe that, when taken together, these enable the counsellor to keep a clear picture of the client's "re-emergence" and are therefore very effective. People disagreeing with the theoretical perspective are asked to think and discharge on the points at issue before actively challenging such perspectives. The main aim is to provide a safe, stable and supportive atmosphere within which people can client skillfully and also lead "re-emergent lives" where they are not dependent in a therapeutic sense, but instead become more energetic and effective (a state known as "zestfulness" in RC).

==Co-Counselling International==
{{Main|Co-Counselling International}}

Co-Counselling International (CCI) was started in 1974 as a breakaway from Re-evaluation Counseling by [[John Heron]], who was at the time director of the Human Potential Research Project, [[University of Surrey]] UK, and Tom Sargent and Dency Sargent from [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Heron, John (1998); ''Co-Counselling''; South Pacific Centre for Human Inquiry, Auckland; available at [http://www.co-cornucopia.org.uk/coco/articles/hman1fun.html]; first edition (1974); Human Potential Research Project, University of Surrey, Guildford&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other breakaways from RC, which involved changes of leadership but otherwise continued to practice in similar ways to RC, the CCI break was ideological, and CCI developed in significantly different ways. The differences are in practice, [[theory]] and organisation.

In practice, the client in CCI co-counselling is wholly in charge of the session. In other words, client and counsellor do not work co-operatively. The counsellor only intervenes in accordance with one of three levels of "contract"—free attention, normal and intensive—which are defined in CCI's principles. The only requirement of the counsellor is that they give "free attention" (that is, full supportive attention) to the client. The other two contracts constitute invitations to the counsellor to make interventions from within those permitted if they feel it is appropriate. The intensive contract can be similar to the RC way of working, although the counsellor is still not permitted to intervene as flexibly as in RC.

The original theory of co-counselling is taught in the CCI fundamentals training courses, and participants learn techniques for releasing, or "discharging", emotions. However, the theory is not seen as a constraint within CCI, and co-counsellors draw on the whole range of [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] theory and methods including [[Analytical psychology|analytical]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]]-[[Behaviorism|behavioural]] and [[transpersonal]] as well as [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic]] approaches. The principal constraint is that the client must be able to work self-directedly.

Organisationally, CCI is a peer network with no core structure. Local and national networks have a variety of organisation. Classes and activities are organised by individuals or groups acting self-directedly. John Heron's status within the network has always been as an equal member, although inevitably as a founder member and activist for some 15 years and the person who developed much of the thinking behind CCI, there was a certain amount of transference on him. Heron now lives in [[New Zealand]] and is involved with the CCI network there.

CCI approaches the issue of personal [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] between co-counsellors as a matter for raising awareness. CCI co-counsellors may and do have the whole range of personal relationships with other co-counsellors. However, new co-counsellors are encouraged not to develop new non-co-counselling relationships with other co-counsellors until they have more experience and experienced co-counsellors will often have people with whom they only have a co-counselling relationship. Teachers of co-counselling are strongly discouraged from having [[Intimate relationship|sexual relationships]] with people they have taught.

==Relations between CCI and RC==
{{Disputed-section|date=March 2008}}
The existence of other co-counselling organisations is generally not mentioned in RC, and RC co-counsellors are often not aware of their existence.

Amongst those within RC who know about it, CCI is often seen as an "attack organisation" and was specifically condemned as such in many private and public conversations by Jackins, who claimed that Heron had started it against a specific agreement not to, and in breach of RC guidelines he had previously agreed to. In turn, Heron and many of his supporters claimed that RC was [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[cult]]-like, and later, that Jackins engaged in [[sexual abuse]] of clients. RC supporters parried that CCI fostered a [[Human sexuality|sexually]]-liberal atmosphere that blurred the boundaries of co-counselling and [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. 

The history of co-counselling including its origins with RC is normally taught on CCI Fundamentals courses.&lt;ref&gt;Evison, Rose &amp; Horobin, Richard (1985); ''How to Change Yourself and Your world''; Co-Counselling Phoenix, Pitlochrie; {{ISBN|1-870224-01-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CCI, by its nature, has no corporate opinion about RC, and individual CCI co-counsellors have their own views.  Most CCI co-counsellors have a benevolent view toward RC, regarding it as a different, alternative approach to co-counselling.  Membership of RC is not a bar to membership of CCI, and a few people manage to do both despite the RC ban.

A '''contract of sale''', '''sales contract''', '''sales order''', or '''contract for sale'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=contract+of+sale%2Ccontract+for+sale%2Csales+contract%2Csales+agreement%2Csales+order&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Ccontract%20of%20sale%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ccontract%20for%20sale%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csales%20contract%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csales%20agreement%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csales%20order%3B%2Cc0 Google Ngram Viewer]&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal [[contract]] for the purchase of assets (goods or property) by a buyer (or purchaser) from a seller (or vendor) for an agreed upon value in money (or money equivalent). 

An obvious ancient practice of exchange, in many [[common law]] jurisdictions, it is now governed by statutory law. See [[commercial law]].

Contracts of sale involving [[good (economics)|goods]] are governed by Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in most [[jurisdiction]]s in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. However in [[Quebec]], such contracts are governed by the [[Civil Code of Quebec]] as a [[nominate contract]] in the book on the [[law of obligations]]. In Muslim countries it is governed by [[sharia]] (Islamic law).

A contract of sale lays out the terms of a transaction of goods or services, identifying the goods sold, listing delivery instructions, inspection period, any warranties and details of payment.

==Description==

Dimensional modeling always uses the concepts of facts (measures), and dimensions (context). Facts are typically (but not always) numeric values that can be aggregated, and dimensions are groups of hierarchies and descriptors that define the facts. For example, sales amount is a fact; timestamp, product, register#, store#, etc. are elements of dimensions. Dimensional models are built by business process area, e.g. store sales, inventory, claims, etc. Because the different business process areas share some but not all dimensions, efficiency in design, operation, and consistency, is achieved using [[Dimension (data warehouse)#Types|conformed dimensions]], i.e. using one copy of the shared dimension across subject areas.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Dimensional modeling does not necessarily involve a relational database. The same modeling approach, at the logical level, can be used for any physical form, such as multidimensional database or even flat files.  It is oriented around understandability and performance.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Design method==

&lt;!-- ==Dimensional modeling process== --&gt;

=== Designing the model ===

The dimensional model is built on a [[star schema|star-like schema]] or [[snowflake schema]], with dimensions surrounding the fact table.&lt;ref name="lifecycle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Golfarelli"/&gt; To build the schema, the following design model is used:

#Choose the business process
#Declare the grain
#Identify the dimensions
#Identify the fact

;Choose the business process:
The process of dimensional modeling builds on a 4-step design method that helps to ensure the usability of the dimensional model and the use of the [[data warehouse]]. The basics in the design build on the actual business process which the [[data warehouse]] should cover. Therefore, the first step in the model is to describe the business process which the model builds on. This could for instance be a sales situation in a retail store. To describe the business process, one can choose to do this in plain text or use basic Business Process Modeling Notation ([[BPMN]]) or other design guides like the Unified Modeling Language ([[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]).

;Declare the grain:
After describing the business process, the next step in the design is to declare the grain of the model. The grain of the model is the exact description of what the dimensional model should be focusing on. This could for instance be “An individual line item on a customer slip from a retail store”. To clarify  what the grain means,  you should pick the central process and describe it with one sentence. Furthermore, the grain (sentence) is what you are going to build your dimensions and fact table from. You might find it necessary to go back to this step to alter the grain due to new information gained on what your model is supposed to be able to deliver.

;Identify the dimensions:
The third step in the design process is to define the dimensions of the model. The dimensions must be defined within the grain from the second step of the 4-step process. Dimensions are the foundation of the fact table, and is where the data for the fact table is collected. Typically dimensions are nouns like date, store, inventory etc. These dimensions are where all the data is stored. For example, the date dimension could contain data such as year, month and weekday.

;Identify the facts:
After defining the dimensions, the next step in the process is to make keys for the fact table. This step is to identify the numeric facts that will populate each fact table row. This step is closely related to the business users of the system, since this is where they get access to data stored in the [[data warehouse]]. Therefore, most of the fact table rows are numerical, additive figures such as quantity or cost per unit, etc.

=== Dimension Normalization ===
{{NPOV section|date=June 2018}}
Dimensional normalization or snowflaking removes redundant attributes, which are known in the normal flatten de-normalized dimensions. Dimensions are strictly joined together in sub dimensions. 
 
Snowflaking has an influence on the data structure that differs from many philosophies of data warehouses.&lt;ref name="Golfarelli"/&gt;
Single data (fact) table surrounded by multiple descriptive (dimension) tables

Developers often don't normalize dimensions due to several reasons:&lt;ref name= "refname4"/&gt;

#Normalization makes the data structure more complex
#Performance can be slower, due to the many joins between tables
#The space savings are minimal
#[[Bitmap index]]es can't be used
#Query performance. [[Third normal form|3NF databases]] suffer from performance problems when aggregating or retrieving many dimensional values that may require analysis. If you are only going to do operational reports then you may be able to get by with 3NF because your operational user will be looking for very fine grain data.

There are some arguments on why normalization can be useful.&lt;ref name="Golfarelli"/&gt; It can be an advantage when part of hierarchy is common to more than one dimension. For example, a geographic dimension may be reusable because both the customer and supplier dimensions use it.

== Benefits of dimensional modeling ==
{{third-party|section|date=June 2018}}
Benefits of the dimensional model are the following:&lt;ref name="refname5"/&gt;
* Understandability. Compared to the normalized model, the dimensional model is easier to understand and more intuitive. In dimensional models, information is grouped into coherent business categories or dimensions, making it easier to read and interpret. Simplicity also allows software to navigate databases efficiently.  In normalized models, data is divided into many discrete entities and even a simple business process might result in dozens of tables joined together in a complex way. 
* Query performance. Dimensional models are more denormalized and optimized for data querying, while normalized models seek to eliminate data redundancies and are optimized for transaction loading and updating.  The predictable framework of a dimensional model allows the database to make strong assumptions about the data which may have a positive impact on performance.  Each dimension is an equivalent entry point into the fact table, and this symmetrical structure allows effective handling of complex queries.  Query optimization for star-joined databases is simple, predictable, and controllable.
* Extensibility. Dimensional models are scalable and easily accommodate unexpected new data.  Existing tables can be changed in place either by simply adding new data rows into the table or executing SQL alter table commands. No queries or applications that sit on top of the data warehouse need to be reprogrammed to accommodate changes. Old queries and applications continue to run without yielding different results. But in normalized models each modification should be considered carefully, because of the complex dependencies between database tables.

== Dimensional Models, Hadoop, and Big Data ==
{{NPOV section|date=June 2018}}
We still get the benefits of dimensional models on [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] and similar big data frameworks. However, some features of Hadoop require us to slightly adapt the standard approach to dimensional modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sonra.io/2017/05/15/dimensional-modeling-and-kimball-data-marts-in-the-age-of-big-data-and-hadoop/|title=Dimensional Modeling and Kimball Data Marts in the Age of Big Data and Hadoop|last=Uli|first=Bethke|date=2017-05-15|website=Sonra|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Apache Hadoop#HDFS|Hadoop File System]] is [[Immutable object|immutable]]. We can only add but not update data. As a result we can only append records to dimension tables. [[Slowly changing dimension|Slowly Changing Dimensions]] on Hadoop become the default behavior. In order to get the latest and most up to date record in a dimension table we have three options. First, we can create a [[View (SQL)|View]] that retrieves the latest record using [[Select (SQL)#Window function|windowing functions]]. Second, we can have a compaction service running in the background that recreates the latest state. Third, we can store our dimension tables in mutable storage, e.g. HBase and federate queries across the two types of storage.
* The way data is distributed across HDFS makes it expensive to join data. In a distributed relational database ([[Massively parallel|MPP]]) we can co-locate records with the same primary and foreign keys on the same node in a cluster. This makes it relatively cheap to join very large tables. No data needs to travel across the network to perform the join. This is very different on Hadoop and HDFS. On HDFS tables are split into big chunks and distributed across the nodes on our cluster. We don’t have any control on how individual records and their keys are spread across the cluster. As a result joins on Hadoop for two very large tables are quite expensive as data has to travel across the network. We should avoid joins where possible. For a large fact and dimension table we can de-normalize the dimension table directly into the fact table. For two very large transaction tables we can nest the records of the child table inside the parent table and flatten out the data at run time.

'''Earnings management''', in [[accounting]], is the act of intentionally influencing the process of [[financial reporting]] to obtain some private gain.&lt;ref name = "S 1989"&gt;Schipper, Katherine. 1989. “Commentary on Earnings Management.” ''Accounting Horizons'' (December): 91–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Earnings management involves the alteration of [[financial reports]] to mislead [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] about the organization's underlying performance, or to "influence contractual outcomes that depend on reported accounting numbers."&lt;ref name = "HW 1999"&gt;Healy, Paul M., and James M. Wahlen. 1999. “A Review of the Earnings Management Literature and Its Implications for Standard Setting.” ''Accounting Horizons'' 13 (4): 365–383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earnings management has a negative effect on [[earnings quality]],&lt;ref name=NYSSCPA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akers|first1=Michael D.|last2=Giacomino|first2=Don E.|last3=Bellovary|first3=Jodi L.|title=Earnings Management and Its Implications: Educating the Accounting Profession|url=http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2007/807/essentials/p64.htm|work=The CPA Journal|publisher=The New York State Society of CPAs|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may weaken the credibility of [[financial reporting]].&lt;ref name="M 1999"&gt;{{cite web|last=Munter|first=Paul|title=SEC Sharply Criticizes "Earnings Management" Accounting|url=http://www.csus.edu/indiv/l/lundbladg/ACCY%20113/113_WA/SEC%20Sharply....pdf|accessdate=14 January 2014|year=1999|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905162446/http://www.csus.edu/indiv/l/lundbladg/ACCY%20113/113_WA/SEC%20Sharply....pdf|archivedate=5 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in a 1998 speech [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] chairman [[Arthur Levitt]] called earnings management "widespread".&lt;ref name="SEC Speech 1998"&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks by Chairman Arthur Levitt|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speecharchive/1998/spch220.txt|publisher=SEC|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its pervasiveness, the complexity of accounting rules can make earnings management difficult for individual investors to detect.&lt;ref name = "Investopedia What" /&gt;

== Occurrence and response by regulators ==
Earnings management is believed to be widespread. A 1990 report on earnings management situations stated that "short-term earnings are being managed in many, if not all companies",&lt;ref name=NYSSCPA /&gt; and in a 1998 speech, [[Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]] chairman [[Arthur Levitt]] called earnings management a "widespread, but too little-challenged custom".&lt;ref name="SEC Speech 1998" /&gt;  In a 2013 essay, [[Ray J. Ball|Ray Ball]], while opining that [[accounting research]] was not reliably documenting earnings management, wrote: "''Of course'' earnings management goes on. [...] People have been tried and convicted."&lt;ref name = "Ball 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball|first=Ray|title=Accounting Informs Investors and Earnings Management is Rife: Two Questionable Beliefs|journal=Accounting Horizons|year=2013|volume=27|issue=4|pages=847–853|doi=10.2308/acch-10366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEC has criticized earnings management as having adverse consequences for financial reporting, and for masking "the true consequences of management's decisions".&lt;ref name="SEC Speech 1998" /&gt; It has called on standard-setters to make changes to [[accounting standards]] to improve [[financial statement]] transparency, and has called for increased oversight over the financial reporting process.&lt;ref name="M 1999" /&gt; The SEC has also pressed charges against the management of firms involved in [[fraud]]ulent earnings management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEC Charges Former Chief Accounting Officer of Beazer Homes for Fraudulent Earnings Management Scheme|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-146.htm|publisher=SEC|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COMMISSION CHARGES TWO FORMER BRISTOL-MYERS OFFICERS FOR FRAUDULENT EARNINGS MANAGEMENT SCHEME|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2005-118.htm|publisher=SEC|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Increasingly, I have become concerned that the motivation to meet Wall Street earnings expectations may be overriding common sense business practices.  Too many corporate managers, auditors, and analysts are participants in a game of nods and winks.  In the zeal to satisfy consensus earnings estimates and project a smooth earnings path, wishful thinking may be winning the day over faithful representation."&lt;ref name="SEC Speech 1998"/&gt;

Earnings management involves the manipulation of company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable earnings, in which case management is said to be carrying out ''income smoothing''.&lt;ref name="Investopedia What"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is earnings management?|url=http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/191.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opportunistic income smoothing can in turn signal lower risk and increase a firm's market value.&lt;ref name="S 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Subramanyam|first=K. R.|title=The pricing of discretionary accruals|journal=Journal of Accounting and Economics|year=1996|volume=22|pages=249–281|doi=10.1016/s0165-4101(96)00434-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain [[financial ratio|accounting ratios]] due to [[debt]] covenants, and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets.&lt;ref name = "RTW 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Scott A. |author2=A. Irem Tuna |author3=Min Wu|title=Predicting Earnings Management: The Case of Earnings Restatements|journal=|date=October 2002|ssrn=338681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earnings management may involve exploiting opportunities to make accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the [[financial statements]]. Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for [[Bad debt|uncollectible accounts]] can have a significant effect on [[net income]], and a company using [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|last-in, first-out accounting]] for [[inventories]] can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.&lt;ref name=Primer&gt;{{cite web|last=Weil|first=Roman L.|author-link=Roman L.

'''Eggert Magnússon''' (born 20 February 1947) is an [[Iceland]]ic businessman and former President of the [[Football Association of Iceland]] and ex-chairman of [[West Ham United]]. Eggert is a former owner and CEO of an import/export and bread and biscuit manufacturing company.

==Brief Football History==
Eggert was president of the [[Football Association of Iceland]] (KSÍ), and was an important voice on the UEFA Executive Committee as a representative of one of UEFA's smaller member associations, but had to resign due to the takeover of West Ham United FC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/aboutuefa/ExecutiveCommitee/exco=53572.html |title=UEFA Organisation - Profile: Eggert Magnússon |accessdate=2006-12-09 |publisher=UEFA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128034838/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/aboutuefa/ExecutiveCommitee/exco%3D53572.html |archivedate=2006-11-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eggert was elected to the [[UEFA]] Executive Committee in April 2002, after previous membership of the Licensed Match Agents panel (1992–94). [[UEFA Fair Play ranking|Fair Play]] Committee (1994–96) and Club Competitions Committee (1996–2002). Eggert contributes to the development of women's football as the Executive Committee’s representative on the Women’s Football Committee, also Eggert is a member of the Clubs and Leagues Working Group.

==Takeover of West Ham United==

===Takeover===
On 21 November 2006, West Ham announced that they had reached an agreement with a consortium headed by Eggert for the sale of the club, worth £85m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=sportsNews&amp;storyID=2006-11-21T175459Z_01_WLB3485_RTRUKOC_0_UK-LEISURE-WEST-HAM-FAPL.xml&amp;WTmodLoc=NewsArt-C2-NextArticle-1 |title=West Ham agree takeover by Icelandic group |accessdate=2006-12-09 |author=Martyn Herman |date=2006-11-21 |publisher=Reuters |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518220152/http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=sportsNews |archivedate=2007-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absent filing the form, a default classification applies. U.S. corporations of the type that can be publicly traded must be treated as corporations. There is a list of specific foreign entities that must be treated as corporations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/301.7701-2 26 CFR 301.7701-2(b)(8)(i)]&lt;/ref&gt; The election is effective for Federal and most [[state income tax]] purposes.

If an entity is not classified as a corporation, it is treated as a [[partnership]] for U.S. tax purposes if it has more than one owner, or is a [[disregarded entity]] if it has a single owner (i.e. is treated as part of the single owner).

The classification of either a U.S. or non-U.S. entity for U.S. tax purposes has no effect for purposes other than U.S. income tax.

==Eligibility to make an election==
An entity, which is eligible to make an election, is referred to as an '''eligible entity'''. Generally, a corporation organized under U.S. federal or state statute (and referred to as a corporation, body corporate or body politic by that statute) is not an eligible entity. However, the following [[types of business entity]] are treated as eligible entities:&lt;ref name="Instructions"/&gt;
#An eligible entity that previously elected to be an association taxable as a corporation by filing Form 8832. An entity that elects to be classified as a corporation by filing Form 8832 can make another election to change its classification, subject to the 60-month limitation rule.
#A foreign eligible entity that became an association taxable as a corporation under the foreign default rule [[#Default classification|described below]].
#A foreign corporation that is not identified as a corporation under [[Treasury regulations]] §301.7701-2(b)(8). If a foreign corporation is not identified on the list included in these regulations, it qualifies as an eligible entity.

The list of foreign entities classified as corporations for federal tax purposes (so called ''per se'' corporations, not eligible to make an entity classification election) includes, as of September 2009:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=8610f90436ab33d90321c10e793c8f1e&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:18.0.1.1.2.20.69.2&amp;idno=26 Treasury regulations §301.7701-2](b)(8); latest amendment T.D. 9462, 74 FR 46904, Sept. 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Default classification==
An eligible entity is classified for federal tax purposes under the default rules described below unless it files Form 8832 or Form 2553, Election by a Small Business Corporation, to elect a classification or change its current classification. The IRS uses the information entered on the form to establish the entity's filing and reporting requirements for federal tax purposes.&lt;ref name="Instructions"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8832.pdf IRS Form 8832: Entity Classification Election]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain domestic and foreign entities that were in existence before January 1, 1997, and have an established federal tax classification generally do not need to make an election to continue that classification. If an existing entity decides to change its classification, it may do so subject to the 60-month limitation rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=8610f90436ab33d90321c10e793c8f1e&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:18.0.1.1.2.20.69.4&amp;idno=26 Treasury regulations §301.7701-3](b)(3) and (h)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless an election is made on Form 8832, a domestic eligible entity will be classified by default as:&lt;ref name="Instructions"/&gt;
# A partnership if it has two or more members.
# Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a single owner. A change in the number of members of an eligible entity classified as an association (defined below) does not affect the entity's classification. However, an eligible entity classified as a partnership will become a disregarded entity when the entity's membership is reduced to one member and a disregarded entity will be classified as a partnership when the entity has more than one member.

Unless an election is made on Form 8832, a foreign eligible entity will be classified by default as:&lt;ref name="Instructions"/&gt;
# A partnership if it has two or more members and at least one member does not have [[limited liability]].
# An association taxable as a corporation if all members have limited liability.
# Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a single owner that does not have limited liability.

The effect of these rules is that a U.S. [[limited liability company]] (LLC) or [[limited liability partnership]] (LLP) is treated by default as a partnership (or disregarded entity if it has only one owner), whereas a foreign LLP is treated by default as a corporation (if, as is generally the case, all its members have limited liability).

If an entity has been operating under one classification for some time, but then elects to change its classification, there may be tax consequences. The initial regulations were unclear on this point, so the IRS issued Revenue Rulings 99-5 and 99-6 in 1999 to address questions surrounding the conversion of an LLC to a partnership and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciremagazine.com/article.php?article_id=476 Clarifying Entity Classification Conversions], Steven M. Friedman &amp; Samuel H. Hoppe, Commercial Investment Real Estate Magazine, July/August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in international tax planning==
The "check-the-box" regulations paved the way for various new [[tax avoidance]] and [[tax deferral]] strategies.&lt;ref name="Sweitzer"&gt;[http://www.uakron.edu/law/lawreview/taxjournal/atj20/docs/Sweitzer201.pdf Analyzing Subpart F in light of Check-the-Box], Cynthia Ram Sweitzer, Akron Tax Journal 20, March 2005. See pp. 9-11, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they expanded the opportunity for "hybrid branch" or "hybrid entity" strategies, which take advantage of differences in the classification of an entity as a corporation or not in multiple jurisdictions, in order to engage in cross-border tax arbitrage. The possibility that the check-the-box rules would greatly expand the potential for such strategies had been pointed out prior to implementation, and at one point some commentators suggested disallowing foreign entities from electing their classification at all; however, in the end, the IRS, while acknowledging such concerns, issued regulations which gave foreign and domestic entities largely similar powers to elect their own classification.&lt;ref name="Ring"/&gt;

US owners of foreign subsidiaries benefit from the ability to have those foreign subsidiaries treated as disregarded entities. Under the United States' [[Internal Revenue Code]] Subpart F, payments between related [[Controlled Foreign Corporation]]s (CFCs), or from American companies to related CFCs, may be "treated as Subpart F income" (subject to current taxation as if they were profits in the hands of the ultimate American owner of the corporate structure), in an effort to limit the ability of American citizens and corporations to [[tax deferral|defer US tax]] on the income of foreign corporations they control. However, payments between an American-owned foreign entity which is taxed as a corporation, and a foreign subsidiary of that entity which itself has elected to be treated as a disregarded entity, are not treated as Subpart F income.&lt;ref name="Sweitzer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CFO"&gt;[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/13638941?f=most_read 'Unchecking the Box' Could Lead to Fierce Debate], CFO Magazine, May 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement may be used to shift income between the two non-American jurisdictions and avoid local taxes in one or the other, e.g. through [[thin capitalisation|thin capitalization]].&lt;ref name="Ring"/&gt; Another category of US taxpayers who benefit from check-the-box regulations consists of US [[flow-through entity|flow-through entities]] ([[S corporation]]s and partnerships) with foreign subsidiaries. If the foreign subsidiary is treated as a corporation, the taxes it pays to the foreign government do not create a [[foreign tax credit]] for the US owner under Section 902. However, with a check-the-box election to be treated as a disregarded entity, the foreign taxes are treated as having been directly imposed on the US owner, thus giving rise to the tax credit.&lt;ref name="Patelski"&gt;"[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5448479/Check-the-box-not-always.html Check-the-Box: Not Always the Right Answer for Certain Foreign Corporations]". Robert Patelski, The Tax Adviser 37(4), April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=ae4faff263908179cc70a6733c575de7&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:9.0.1.1.1.0.11.189&amp;idno=26 Internal revenue regulations §1.902]&lt;/ref&gt;

For US owners with foreign subsidiaries, choosing to have a subsidiary treated as a disregarded entity is not always the most beneficial tax-planning choice, however. For example, if a US taxpayer owns a disregarded foreign entity, its income will be taxed at the owner's ordinary US income tax rates, less the foreign tax already paid. This may result in every marginal dollar being taxed at the highest rate. However, if the foreign entity had elected to be taxed as a corporation (or been classified as such by default), paid a low rate tax in the foreign country, then repatriated its income to the US by paying [[qualified dividends]] to its owner, the total proportion of tax paid on income might actually be less, as qualified dividends are only taxed at 15%. However, this treatment is only available for dividends from corporations in certain countries, and is set to sunset in 2010 under the [[Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005]].&lt;ref name="Patelski"/&gt;

Foreign owners of US corporations also benefit from the ability to have entities normally treated as flow-through instead be taxed as corporations by the IRS. In what is sometimes known as a "domestic reverse hybrid" strategy, a non-US corporation may set up a US holding company which elects to be treated as a corporation for US tax purposes, but which its home country tax law sees as a [[flow-through entity]]. The US holding company receives a loan from its home country parent which it invests in a US operating subsidiary; the US holding company receives dividends from the US operation subsidiary and pays interest to the non-US parent. US tax law thus sees a US company making a dividend payment to another US company (which is thus not subject to withholding tax, unlike a dividend paid to a foreign company) which then pays interest to a foreign company, while the home country tax law will see a US company paying dividends directly to its home country parent. Under typical treaties for the relief of [[double taxation]], neither government has the right to tax the payment, because each sees it as a type of payment which only the other has the right to tax.&lt;ref name="Ring"/&gt;

==History==
Prior to 1996, whether domestic and foreign entities were classified as corporations was based on a six-factor test which looked at:&lt;ref name="Ring"&gt;[http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2221&amp;context=bclr One Nation Among Many: Policy Implications of Cross-Border Tax Arbitrage], Diane M. Ring, Boston College Law Review 44(1), December 1, 2002. See pp. 96-98.&lt;/ref&gt;
#limited liability;
#continuity of life;
#free transferability of interests;
#centralized management;
#associates;
#objective to carry on business for joint profit

An entity which had a preponderance of the first four factors (the last two, in practice, were shared by all business entities) was treated as a corporation, otherwise as a partnership or an association.&lt;ref name="IRM"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-061-005.html Internal Revenue Manual, Part 4. Examining Process, Chapter 61. LMSB International Program Audit Guidelines, Section 5. Entity Classification], Internal Revenue Service, May 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, this test was easily manipulated.&lt;ref name="Ring"/&gt;

The "check-the-box" regulations (Treasury Decision 8697) were adopted in 1996 in order to simplify the issue of entity classification. A [[grandfather clause]] allowed entities in existence on May 8, 1996 to continue using their previous classification, even if they would no longer be eligible to elect that classification under the new rules.&lt;ref name="PMS"&gt;[http://pmstax.com/part/bull9612.shtml Internal Revenue Service Adopts "Check-the-Box" Classification Regulations], Partnership Tax Bulletin, [[Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman]], December 1996&lt;/ref&gt; There were three conditions for this grandfathering:&lt;ref name="IRM"/&gt;
#the entity had a reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) for its claimed classification;
#the entity and all owners recognized the federal tax consequences of any change in classification within 60 months prior to January 1, 1997; and
#neither the entity nor its owners had been advised that the entity was under examination on or before May 8, 1996.

The initial regulations also included a list of foreign entities which would always be classified as corporations ("per-se corporations") and which could not elect to be disregarded.&lt;ref name="Ring"/&gt; The proposed regulations included [[naamloze vennootschap]] formed under the laws of Aruba or the Netherlands Antilles in that list, but they were removed from the final list; conversely, Canadian corporations were added to the list.&lt;ref name="PMS"/&gt;

In 1998, the IRS issued Notice 98-11, 1998-1 C.B. 433 in an attempt to combat the use of "check-the-box" in international tax planning (see below); however, the notice met opposition, and was withdrawn by Notice 98-35, 1998-2 C.B. 34.&lt;ref name="Sweitzer"/&gt; Another proposal, around 1999, would have left the basic check-the-box regime in place, but allowed the IRS to disregard entity classification elections made in connection with "extraordinary transactions" (where the tax liability changes "significantly" as a result of the election).&lt;ref name="Sweitzer"/&gt; An "extraordinary transaction" was defined as one in which there was a sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposition of a 10-percent or greater interest in a foreign entity; the proposed regulations provided that an election to be classified as a disregarded entity could be ignored, and thus the entity continue to be taxed as a corporation, if the election occurred within twelve months following the day before an extraordinary transaction.&lt;ref name="TEI"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Comments+on+changes+in+entity+classification:+special+rule+for...-a063639840 Comments on changes in entity classification: special rule for certain foreign eligible entities.] Tax Executive, April 4, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, various tax professionals opposed the changes, arguing that the threshold for defining an extraordinary transaction was far too low, and that existing internal revenue regulations, as well as common law doctrines such as the principle of [[substance over form]] and the [[step transaction doctrine]], were already sufficient to combat any abuses of the check-the-box rules.&lt;ref name="TEI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Entity+classification+simplification+not+that+simple-a062281367 Entity classification simplification not that simple], Shawn Carson &amp; John Santa Maria, The Tax Adviser, May 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] attempted to revive the IRS' 1998 notice in his proposed 2010 budget.&lt;ref name="CFO"/&gt; Specifically, the proposal stated:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/grnbk09.pdf General Explanations of the Administration's Fiscal Year 2010 Revenue Proposals], Department of the Treasury, May 2009. See p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''Reform business entity classification rules for foreign entities:''' Under the proposal, a foreign eligible entity may be treated as a disregarded entity only if the single owner of the foreign eligible entity is created or organized in, or under the law of, the foreign country in, or under the law of, which the foreign eligible entity is created or organized. Therefore, a foreign eligible entity with a single owner that is organized or created in a country other than that of its single owner would be treated as a corporation for federal tax purposes. Except in cases of U.S. tax avoidance, the proposal would generally not apply to a first-tier foreign eligible entity wholly owned by a United States person. The tax treatment of the conversion to a corporation of a foreign eligible entity treated as a disregarded entity would be consistent with current Treasury regulations and relevant tax principles.}}

The proposal was eventually dropped again due to criticism from businesses, and it was not included again in the 2011 budget proposal either.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/Tax_2011ObamaBudget_LF_02feb10.pdf Obama’s 2011 Budget: Check-the-Box off the Table; Subpart F Expanded] Morgan Lewis Tax Flash, February 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23776">The '''envelope theorem''' is a result about the   differentiability properties of the objective function of a parameterized optimization problem. As we change parameters of the objective, the envelope theorem shows that, in a certain sense, changes in the optimizer of the objective do not contribute to the change in the objective function. The envelope theorem is an important tool for [[comparative statics]] of [[optimization]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Carter |title=Foundations of Mathematical Economics |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-262-53192-5 |pages=603–609 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KysvrGGfzq0C&amp;pg=PA603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;f(x,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{j}(x,\alpha), j = 1,2, \ldots, m&lt;/math&gt; be real-valued continuously [[differentiable function]]s on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n+l}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; are choice variables and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^{l}&lt;/math&gt; are parameters, and consider the problem of choosing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, for a given &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, so as to:
:&lt;math&gt; \max_{x} f(x, \alpha)&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;g_{j}(x,\alpha) \geq 0, j = 1,2, \ldots, m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
The Lagrangian expression of this problem is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} (x, \lambda, \alpha) = f(x, \alpha) + \lambda \cdot g(x, \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{m}&lt;/math&gt; are the Lagrange multipliers. Now let &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{\ast}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; together be the solution that maximizes the objective function ''f'' subject to the constraints (and hence are [[saddle point]]s of the Lagrangian),
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^{\ast} (\alpha) \equiv f(x^{\ast}(\alpha), \alpha) + \lambda^{\ast}(\alpha) \cdot g(x^{\ast}(\alpha), \alpha),&lt;/math&gt;
and define the value function

==For arbitrary choice sets==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denote the choice set and let the relevant parameter be &lt;math&gt;t\in \lbrack 0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Letting &lt;math&gt;f:X\times \lbrack 0,1]\rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; denote the parameterized objective function, the value function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and the optimal choice correspondence (set-valued function) &lt;math&gt;X^{\ast }&lt;/math&gt; are given by:

:&lt;math&gt; V(t) =\sup_{x\in X}f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; (1)
:&lt;math&gt; X^{\ast }(t) =\{x\in X:f(x,t)=V(t)\}&lt;/math&gt; (2)

"Envelope theorems" describe sufficient conditions for the value function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to be differentiable in the parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and describe its derivative as

:&lt;math&gt; V^{\prime }\left( t\right) =f_{t}\left( x,t\right) \text{ for each }x\in X^{\ast }\left( t\right),&lt;/math&gt; (3)

where &lt;math&gt;f_{t}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the partial derivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Namely, the derivative of the value function with respect to the parameter equals the partial derivative of the objective function with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; holding the maximizer fixed at its optimal level. (The term derives from describing the graph of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; as the "upper envelope" of the graphs of the parameterized family of functions &lt;math&gt;\left\{ f\left( x,\cdot \right) \right\} _{x\in X}&lt;/math&gt;.)

Traditional envelope theorem derivations use the first-order condition for (1), which requires that the choice set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; have the convex and topological structure, and the objective function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable in the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. (The argument is that changes in the maximizer have only a "second-order effect" at the optimum and so can be ignored.) However, in many applications such as the analysis of incentive constraints in contract theory and game theory, nonconvex production problems, and "monotone" or "robust" comparative statics, the choice sets and objective functions generally lack the topological and convexity properties required by the traditional envelope theorems.

[[Paul Milgrom]] and Segal (2002) observe that the traditional envelope formula holds for optimization problems with arbitrary choice sets at any differentiability point of the value function,&lt;ref name="Milgrom and Segal, 2002" /&gt; provided that the objective function is differentiable in the parameter:

'''Theorem 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;t\in \left( 0,1\right) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in X^{\ast }\left(t\right) &lt;/math&gt;. If both &lt;math&gt;V^{\prime }\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_{t}\left(x,t\right) &lt;/math&gt; exist, the envelope formula (3) holds.

'''Proof:''' (1) implies that for &lt;math&gt;x\in X^{\ast }\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \max_{s\in \left[ 0,1\right] }\left[ f\left( x,s\right) -V\left( s\right)\right] =f\left( x,t\right) -V\left( t\right) =0. &lt;/math&gt;

Under the assumptions, the objective function of the displayed maximization problem is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;s=t&lt;/math&gt;, and the first-order condition for this maximization is exactly (3). Q.E.D.

While differentiability of the value function in general requires strong assumptions, in many applications weaker conditions such as absolute continuity, differentiability almost everywhere, or left- and right-differentiability, suffice. In particular, Milgrom and Segal 's (2002) Theorem 2 offers a sufficient condition for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to be absolutely continuous,&lt;ref name="Milgrom and Segal, 2002" /&gt; which means that it is differentiable almost everywhere and can be represented as an integral of its derivative:

'''Theorem 2:''' Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f(x,\cdot )&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely continuous for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose also that there exists an integrable function &lt;math&gt;b:[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_{+}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|f_{t}(x,t)|\leq b(t)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and almost all &lt;math&gt;t\in \lbrack 0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely continuous. Suppose, in addition, that &lt;math&gt;f(x,\cdot )&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt;X^{\ast }(t)\neq \varnothing &lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere on &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Then for any selection &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }(t)\in X^{\ast }(t)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; V(t)=V(0)+\int_{0}^{t}f_{t}(x^{\ast }(s),s)ds. &lt;/math&gt; (4)

'''Proof:''' Using (1), observe that for any &lt;math&gt;t^{\prime},t^{\prime \prime }\in \lbrack 0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;t^{\prime }&lt;t^{\prime \prime }&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; |V(t^{\prime \prime })-V(t^{\prime })| \leq \sup_{x\in X}|f(x,t^{\prime\prime })-f(x,t^{\prime })| =\sup_{x\in X}\left\vert \int_{t^{\prime }}^{t^{\prime \prime }}f_{t}(x,t)dt\right\vert \leq \int_{t^{\prime }}^{t^{\prime \prime
}}\sup_{x\in X}|f_{t}(x,t)|dt\leq \int_{t^{\prime }}^{t^{\prime \prime }}b(t)dt.&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely continuous. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable almost everywhere, and using (3) yields (4). Q.E.D.

This result dispels the common misconception that nice behavior of the value function requires correspondingly nice behavior of the maximizer. Theorem 2 ensures the [[absolute continuity]] of the value function even though the maximizer may be discontinuous. In a similar vein, Milgrom and Segal's (2002) Theorem 3 implies that the value function must be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;t=t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and hence satisfy the envelope formula (3) when the family &lt;math&gt;\left\{ f\left( x,\cdot \right) \right\} _{x\in X}&lt;/math&gt; is equi-differentiable at &lt;math&gt;t_{0}\in \left( 0,1\right) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_{t}\left(X^{\ast }\left( t\right) ,t_{0}\right) &lt;/math&gt; is single-valued and continuous at &lt;math&gt;t=t_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, even if the maximizer is not differentiable at &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; (e.g., if &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt; is described by a set of inequality constraints and the set of binding constraints changes at &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="Milgrom and Segal, 2002" /&gt;

==Applications==

===Applications to producer theory===
Theorem 1 implies [[Hotelling's lemma]] at any differentiability point of the profit function, and Theorem 2 implies the [[producer surplus]] formula. Formally, let &lt;math&gt;\pi \left( p\right) &lt;/math&gt; denote the profit function of a price-taking firm with production set &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{L}&lt;/math&gt; facing prices &lt;math&gt;p\in \mathbb{R}^{L}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }\left( p\right) &lt;/math&gt; denote the firm's supply function, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; \pi (p)=\max_{x\in X}p\cdot x=p\cdot x^{\ast }\left( p\right) \text{.} &lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;t=p_{i}&lt;/math&gt; (the price of good &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;) and fix the other goods' prices at &lt;math&gt;p_{-i}\in \mathbb{R}^{L-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Applying Theorem 1 to &lt;math&gt;f(x,t)=tx_{i}+p_{-i}\cdot x_{-i}&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \pi (p)}{\partial p_{i}}=x_{i}^{\ast }(p)&lt;/math&gt; (the firm's optimal supply of good &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;). Applying Theorem 2 (whose assumptions are verified when &lt;math&gt;p_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is restricted to a bounded interval) yields

:&lt;math&gt;\pi (t,p_{-i})-\pi (0,p_{-i})=\int_{0}^{p_{i}}x_{i}^{\ast }(s,p_{-i})ds, &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the producer surplus &lt;math&gt;\pi (t,p_{-i})-\pi (0,p_{-i})&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained by integrating under the firm's supply curve for good &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

===Applications to mechanism design and auction theory===
Consider an agent whose utility function &lt;math&gt;f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; over outcomes &lt;math&gt;x\in \bar{X}&lt;/math&gt; depends on his type &lt;math&gt;t\in \lbrack 0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq \bar{X}&lt;/math&gt; represent the "menu" of possible outcomes the agent could obtain in the mechanism by sending different messages. The agent's equilibrium utility &lt;math&gt;V(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the mechanism is then given by (1), and the set &lt;math&gt;X^{\ast }(t)&lt;/math&gt; of the mechanism's equilibrium outcomes is given by (2). Any selection &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }(t)\in X^{\ast }(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a choice rule implemented by the mechanism. Suppose that the agent's utility function &lt;math&gt;f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable and absolutely continuous in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in Y&lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt;\sup_{x\in \bar{X}}|f_{t}(x,t)|&lt;/math&gt; is integrable on &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Then Theorem 2 implies that the agent's equilibrium utility &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; in any mechanism implementing a given choice rule &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy the integral condition (4).

The integral condition (4) is a key step in the analysis of mechanism design problems with continuous type spaces. In particular, in Myerson's (1981) analysis of single-item auctions, the outcome from the viewpoint of one bidder can be described as &lt;math&gt;x=\left( y,z\right) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the bidder's probability of receiving the object and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is his expected payment, and the bidder's expected utility takes the form &lt;math&gt;f\left( \left( y,z\right) ,t\right) =ty-z&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, letting &lt;math&gt;\underline{t}&lt;/math&gt; denote the bidder's lowest possible type, the integral condition (4) for the bidder's equilibrium expected utility &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; takes the form

:&lt;math&gt; V(t)-V(\underline{t})=\int_{0}^{t}y^{\ast }(s)ds. &lt;/math&gt;

(This equation can be interpreted as the producer surplus formula for the firm whose production technology for converting numeraire &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; into probability &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of winning the object is defined by the auction and which resells the object at a fixed price &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;). This condition in turn yields Myerson's (1981) celebrated [[Revenue equivalence|revenue equivalence theorem]]: the expected revenue generated in an auction in which bidders have independent private values is fully determined by the bidders' probabilities &lt;math&gt;y^{\ast }\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt; of getting the object for all types &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as well as by the expected payoffs &lt;math&gt;V(\underline{t})&lt;/math&gt; of the bidders' lowest types. Finally, this condition is a key step in Myerson's (1981) of optimal auctions.&lt;ref name="Myerson, 1981" /&gt;

===Applications to multidimensional parameter spaces===
For a multidimensional parameter space &lt;math&gt;T\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{K}&lt;/math&gt;, Theorem
1 can be applied to partial and directional derivatives of the value
function. If both the objective function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the value function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are
(totally) differentiable in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, Theorem 1 implies the envelope formula for
their gradients: &lt;math&gt;\nabla V\left( t\right) =\nabla _{t}f\left( x,t\right) &lt;/math&gt;
for each &lt;math&gt;x\in X^{\ast }\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt;. While total differentiability of
the value function may not be easy to ensure, Theorem 2 can be still applied
along any smooth path connecting two parameter values &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
Namely, suppose that functions &lt;math&gt;f(x,\cdot )&lt;/math&gt; are differentiable for all &lt;math&gt;
x\in X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|\nabla _{t}f(x,t)|\leq B&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;t\in T&lt;/math&gt;. A
smooth path from &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is described by a differentiable mapping &lt;math&gt;
\gamma :\left[ 0,1\right] \rightarrow T&lt;/math&gt; with a bounded derivative, such
that &lt;math&gt;\gamma \left( 0\right) =t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma \left( 1\right) =t&lt;/math&gt;.
Theorem 2 implies that for any such smooth path, the change of the value
function can be expressed as the [[line integral|path integral]] of the partial gradient &lt;math&gt;
\nabla _{t}f(x^{\ast }(t),t)&lt;/math&gt; of the objective function along the path:

:&lt;math&gt; V(t)-V(t_{0})=\int_{\gamma }\nabla _{t}f(x^{\ast }(s),s)\cdot ds. &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, for &lt;math&gt;t=t_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, this establishes that cyclic path integrals
along any smooth path &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt; must be zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \nabla _{t}f(x^{\ast }(s),s)\cdot ds=0. &lt;/math&gt;

This "integrability condition" plays an important role in mechanism design with multidimensional types, constraining what kind of choice rules &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }&lt;/math&gt; can be sustained by mechanism-induced menus &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq \bar{X}&lt;/math&gt;. In application to producer theory, with &lt;math&gt;x\in X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{L}&lt;/math&gt; being the firm's production vector and &lt;math&gt;t\in \mathbb{R}^{L}&lt;/math&gt; being the price vector, &lt;math&gt;f\left( x,t\right) =t\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, and the integrability condition says that any rationalizable supply function &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; \int x^{\ast }(s)\cdot ds=0. &lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }&lt;/math&gt; is continuously differentiable, this integrability condition is equivalent to the symmetry of the [[substitution matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\partial x_{i}^{\ast }\left( t\right) /\partial t_{j}\right) _{i,j=1}^{L}&lt;/math&gt;. (In [[consumer theory]], the same argument applied to the expenditure minimization problem yields symmetry of the [[Slutsky matrix]].)

===Applications to parameterized constraints===
Suppose now that the feasible set &lt;math&gt;X\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt; depends on the parameter, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; V(t) =\sup_{x\in X\left( t\right) }f(x,t) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; X^{\ast }(t) =\{x\in X\left( t\right) :f(x,t)=V(t)\}\text{, } &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; X\left( t\right) =\left\{ x\in X:g\left( x,t\right) \geq 0\right\}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; g:X\times \left[ 0,1\right] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{K}. &lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a convex set, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are concave in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and there exists &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g\left( \hat{x},t\right) &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t\in \left[ 0,1\right] &lt;/math&gt;. Under these assumptions, it is well known that the above constrained optimization program can be represented as a [[Saddle point|saddle-point problem]] for the Lagrangian &lt;math&gt;L\left( x,\lambda,t\right) =f(x,t)+\lambda\cdot g\left( x,t\right) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{K}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of [[Lagrange multiplier]]s chosen by the adversary to minimize the Lagrangian.&lt;ref name="Luenberger, 1969"&gt;{{cite book | author= Luenberger, D.

In particular, letting &lt;math&gt;\left( x^{\ast}(t),\lambda^{\ast }\left( t\right) \right) &lt;/math&gt; denote the Lagrangian's saddle point for parameter value &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the theorem implies that &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely continuous and satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; V(t)=V(0)+\int_{0}^{t}L_{t}(x^{\ast }(s),\lambda^{\ast }\left( s\right) ,s)ds. &lt;/math&gt;

For the special case in which &lt;math&gt;f\left( x,t\right) &lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K=1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;g\left( x,t\right) =h\left( x\right) +t&lt;/math&gt;, the formula implies that &lt;math&gt;V^{\prime }(t)=L_{t}(x^{\ast }(t),\lambda^{\ast }\left( t\right) ,t)=\lambda^{\ast}\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt; for a.e. &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the Lagrange multiplier &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{\ast}\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt; on the constraint is its "[[shadow price]]" in the optimization program.&lt;ref name="Rockafellar, 1970"&gt;{{cite book | author= Rockafellar, R.

===Other applications===
Milgrom and Segal (2002) demonstrate that the generalized version of the envelope theorems can also be applied to convex programming, continuous optimization problems, saddle-point problems, and optimal stopping problems.&lt;ref name="Milgrom and Segal, 2002" /&gt;

An '''escalation clause''' is a clause in a [[lease]] or [[contract]] that guarantees a change in the agreement price once a particular factor beyond control of either party affecting the value has been determined. An important example of this is a contract that adjusts for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crawford and Stewart|title=Writing an escalation contract using the Consumer Price Index|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-1/writing-an-escalation-contract-using-the-consumer-price-index.htm|publisher=US BLS|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Escalation clauses are quite common in construction contracts to cover unexpected costs due to fluctuations in the prices for [[raw materials]], fuel, and labor during the course of the construction project. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''Fraud in the factum''' is a type of [[fraud]] where [[misrepresentation]] causes one to enter a [[Financial transaction|transaction]] without accurately realizing the risks, duties, or obligations incurred.&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] (2nd Pocket ed. 2001 pg. 293).&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be when the maker or drawer of a [[negotiable instrument]], such as a [[promissory note]] or [[Cheque|check]], is induced to sign the instrument without a reasonable opportunity to learn of its fraudulent character or essential terms.  Determination of whether an act constitutes fraud in the factum depends upon consideration of "all relevant factors".  Fraud in the factum usually voids the instrument under state law and is a [[real defense]] against even an [[holder in due course]].

Contrast this with the situation where a trusted employee signs a check without permission.  The employer must still honor the check despite the fact that the check was a fraudulent negotiable instrument.  Here, the employer had a reasonable opportunity to avoid the obligation by restricting access to the checks.

'''Fraud in the factum is often contrasted with fraud in the inducement.'''

* ''Fraud in the factum'' is a [[law|legal]] defense, and occurs where A makes/signs an agreement, but either does not realize that it is supposed to be a contract, or does not understand the nature/content of the agreement, because of some false information that B gave to A.  ''For example,'' suppose John tells his mother that he is taking a college course on handwriting analysis, and for his homework he needs her to read and sign a pretend deed.  If Mom signs the deed believing what he told her, and John tries to enforce the deed, Mom can plead "fraud in the factum".
* ''Fraud in the inducement'' is an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] defense, and occurs when A enters into an agreement, knowing that it is supposed to be a contract and (at least having a rough idea) what the agreement is about, but the reason A signed/made the agreement was because of some false information that B gave to A.  ''For example,'' suppose John tells his mother to sign a deed giving him her property, Mom refuses at first, but then John falsely tells her that the bank will foreclose on the property unless she signs it over to him.  If Mom signs the deed because of this statement from John, and John tries to enforce the deed, Mom can plead "fraud in the inducement".

'''Ijeoma Ndukwe-Egwuronu''' (Ijeoma Ndukwe-Egwuronu; born 12 May 1982) is a [[Nigerian]] Entrepreneur popularly known as '''Nwanyi Akamụ''' (Igbo term for a woman that sells Pap) or '''Iyaologi''' (Yoruba term for a woman that sells Pap) in reference to her food processing business, Bubez Foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leading Ladies|first1=Africa|title=Ijeoma Ndukwe-Egwuronu|url=https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/ijeoma-ndukwe-egwuronu/|accessdate=5 May 2017|agency=The Guardian Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Ijeoma who grew up in [[Owerri]], [[Imo State]], is the first child in a family of six and started her early education in Assumpta Primary School, Owerri before moving on for high school at the Owerri Girls Secondary School. Subsequently, she went to the [[University of Calabar]] where she obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Human Physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Itimi|first1=Peace|title=I ran a high end boutique for 8 years before I ventured into selling akamu (pap) - Mrs. Ijeoma Ndukwe-Egwuronu.

==Entrepreneurial Pursuits==
Ijeoma founded Bubez Plaiz, a retail store in 2004 and ran the business for 8 years before folding up in 2012 as a result of business bad debts. According to an interview she gave to The Guardian (Nigerian edition), Ijeoma "went to God in prayer seeking an answer" to her problems and that was how Bubez Foods, a food processing business that utilized [[corn]] as a major raw material, was birthed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leading Ladies|first1=Africa|title=Ijeoma Ndukwe-Egwuronu|url=https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/ijeoma-ndukwe-egwuronu/|accessdate=5 May 2017|agency=The Guardian Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since experimented with several variants of her signature product, pap and currently has over 7 variants of the Bubez Pap Mixed Grains Paste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ajumobi|first1=Kemi|title=Face your fears and do it anyway – Ijeoma|url=https://www.businessdayonline.com/face-fears-anyway-ijeoma/|accessdate=5 May 2017|agency=Business Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ijeoma is passionate about women empowerment and in an interview with [[Vanguard (Nigeria)]], stated that "women who deliver their jobs excellently should be given the opportunity to take their rightful positions in their chosen fields of endeavour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nosike|first1=Moses|title=‘Let’s develop our traditional foods with research, modern technology’|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/12/lets-develop-traditional-foods-research-modern-technology/|accessdate=5 May 2017|agency=Vanguard Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurial Challenges==
Ijeoma has maintained that storage of raw products and finished goods remain one of the most challenging issue in Nigeria's Agriculture Value Chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Africa|first1=Nosike|title=Bubez Foods boss on Nigeria’s agriculture value chain challenges|url=http://www.cnbcafrica.com/videos/2016/12/09/bubez-foods-boss-on-nigerias-agriculture-value-chain-challenges/|accessdate=5 May 2017|agency=CNBC Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Insolvency''' is the state of being unable to pay the money owed, by a person or company, on time; those in a state of insolvency are said to be ''insolvent''. There are two forms: cash-flow insolvency and balance-sheet insolvency.

'''Cash-flow insolvency''' is when a person or company has enough [[Asset|assets]] to pay what is owed, but does not have the appropriate form of payment.  For example, a person may own a large house and a valuable car, but not have enough liquid assets to pay a debt when it falls due.  Cash-flow insolvency can usually be resolved by negotiation.  For example, the bill collector may wait until the car is sold and the debtor agrees to pay a penalty.

'''Balance-sheet insolvency''' is when a person or company does not have enough assets to pay all of their debts.  The person or company might enter [[bankruptcy]], but not necessarily.  Once a loss is accepted by all parties, negotiation is often able to resolve the situation without bankruptcy.

A company that is balance-sheet insolvent may still have enough cash to pay its next bill on time.  However, most laws will not let the company pay that bill unless it will directly help all their creditors. For example, an insolvent farmer may be allowed to hire people to help harvest the crop, because ''not'' harvesting and selling the crop would be even ''worse'' for his creditors.

It has been suggested that the speaker or writer should either say '''technical insolvency''' or '''actual insolvency''' in order to always be clear - where technical insolvency is a [[synonym]] for balance sheet insolvency, which means that its liabilities are greater than its assets, and actual insolvency is a synonym for the first definition of insolvency ("Insolvency is the inability of a debtor to pay their debt.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Graeme Pietersz|title=Moneyterms Investment Definitions|url=http://moneyterms.co.uk/technical-insolvency/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While technical insolvency is a synonym for balance-sheet insolvency, cash-flow insolvency and actual insolvency are not synonyms.  The term "cash-flow insolvent" carries a strong (but perhaps not absolute) connotation that the debtor is balance-sheet solvent, whereas the term "actually insolvent" does not.

==Technical definitions==

Cash-flow insolvency involves a lack of [[accounting liquidity|liquidity]] to pay debts as they fall due.

Balance sheet insolvency involves having negative [[net assets]]—where liabilities exceed assets. Insolvency is not a [[synonym]] for [[bankruptcy]], which is a determination of insolvency made by a [[court of law]] with resulting legal orders intended to resolve the insolvency.

Accounting insolvency happens when total liabilities exceed total assets (negative net worth).&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Corporate Finance, Ross-Westerfield-Jordan, 10th e, p.549&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Graeme Pietersz|title=Moneyterms Investment Definitions|url=http://moneyterms.co.uk/insolvency/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downes, John, and Jordan Elliot. Goodman. ''Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms''. Hauppauge, NY: Barron's Educational Series, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UK Insolvency Act 1986, Section 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
The principal focus of modern insolvency [[legislation]] and business [[debt restructuring]] practices no longer rests on the [[liquidation]] and elimination of insolvent entities but on the remodeling of the financial and organizational structure of debtors experiencing [[financial distress]] so as to permit the rehabilitation and continuation of their business. This is known as '''business turnaround''' or '''business recovery'''. Implementing a business turnaround may take many forms, including keep and restructure, sale as a going concern, or wind-down and exit. In some jurisdictions, it is an [[offence (law)|offence]] under the insolvency laws for a [[corporation]] to continue in business while insolvent. In others (like the United States with its [[Chapter 11]] provisions), the business may continue under a declared protective arrangement while alternative options to achieve recovery are worked out. Increasingly, legislatures have favored alternatives to winding up companies for good.

It can be, in several jurisdictions, grounds for a civil action or even an offence, to continue to pay some [[creditor]]s in preference to other creditors once a state of insolvency is reached.&lt;ref&gt;Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the People's Republic of China (August 27, 2006), Chapter 2, Section 2, Article 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debt restructuring==
Debt restructurings are typically handled by professional insolvency and restructuring practitioners, and are usually less expensive and a preferable alternative to bankruptcy.

[[Debt restructuring]] is a process that allows a private or public company - or a sovereign entity - facing cash flow problems and financial distress, to reduce and renegotiate its delinquent debts in order to improve or restore liquidity and rehabilitate so that it can continue its operations.

==Government debt==
Although the term "bankrupt" may be used referring to a government, sovereign states do not go bankrupt. This is so because bankruptcy is governed by national law; there exists no entity to take over such a government and distribute assets to creditors. Governments ''can'' be insolvent in terms of not having money to pay obligations when they are due. If a government does not meet an obligation, it is in "[[default (finance)|default]]". As governments are [[sovereignty|sovereign]] entities, persons who hold debt of the government cannot seize the assets of the government to re-pay the debt. The recourse for the creditor is to request to be repaid at least some of what is owed. However, in most cases, debt in default is [[refinancing|refinanced]] by further borrowing or [[monetization|monetized]] by issuing more [[currency]] (which typically results in [[inflation]] and may result in [[hyperinflation]]).

==Law==
Insolvency regimes around the world have evolved in very different ways, with laws focusing on different strategies for dealing with the insolvent. The outcome of an insolvent restructuring can be very different depending on the laws of the state in which the insolvency proceeding is run, and in many cases different [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in a company may hold the advantage in different [[jurisdictions]].&lt;ref name="Practitioner"&gt;Joseph Swanson and Peter Marshall, [[Houlihan Lokey]] and Lyndon Norley, Kirkland &amp; Ellis International LLP (2008). A Practitioner's Guide to Corporate Restructuring. City &amp; Financial Publishing, 1st edition {{ISBN|978-1-905121-31-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Australian insolvency law}}
In [[Australia]] Corporate insolvency is governed by the [[Corporations Act 2001]] (Cth). Companies can be put into Voluntary Administration, Creditors Voluntary Liquidation &amp; Court Liquidation. Secured creditors with registered charges are able to appoint Receivers and Receivers &amp; Managers depending on their charge.

===Canada===
{{main|Insolvency law of Canada}}
In [[Canada]], bankruptcy and insolvency are generally regulated by the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]. An alternative regime is available to larger companies (or affiliated groups) under the [[Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act]], where total debts exceed $5 million.&lt;ref name = CCCA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br03125.html | title = Restructure your business through the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act | publisher = Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada| accessdate = 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{main|Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code}}
In [[India]], bankruptcy and insolvency are generally regulated by the [[Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code]] 2016.The [[Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India|Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI]]) is the [[Regulatory agency|regulator]] for overseeing insolvency ''proceedings'' and entities like Insolvency Professional Agencies (IPA), Insolvency Professionals (IP) and Information Utilities (IU) in [[India]].

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]], owners of businesses that had at any stage traded insolvently (i.e. that had a balance-sheet insolvency) become personally liable for the business' debts. Trading insolvently is often regarded as normal business practice in South Africa, as long as the business is able to fulfill its debt obligations when they fall due.

===Switzerland===
{{main|Insolvency law of Switzerland}}
Under [[Switzerland|Swiss]] law, insolvency or [[foreclosure]] may lead to the seizure and auctioning off of assets (generally in the case of private individuals) or to [[bankruptcy]] proceedings (generally in the case of registered commercial entities).

===Turkey===
Turkish insolvency law is regulated by Enforcement And Bankruptcy Law (Code No: 2004, Original Name: İcra ve İflas Kanunu). Main concept of the insolvency law is very similar to Swiss and German insolvency laws. Enforcement methods are realizing pledged property, seizure of assets and bankruptcy.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|United Kingdom insolvency law}}
====Insolvency Act 1986====
In the United Kingdom, the term [[bankruptcy]] is reserved for individuals. Insolvency is defined both in terms of [[cash flow]] and in terms of [[balance sheet]] in the UK [[Insolvency Act 1986]], Section 123, which reads in part:

{{Quote
 |
123.-(1) A company is deemed unable to pay its debts ---&lt;br /&gt;(a) if a creditor (by assignment or otherwise) to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served on the company, by leaving it at the company's registered office, a written demand (in the prescribed form) requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has for 3 weeks thereafter neglected to pay the sum or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor,...
     (2) A company is also deemed unable to pay its debts if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities...
 | [[Insolvency Act 1986]], Section 123 (Part IV, Chapter VI), p. 68.
 }}

A company which is insolvent may be put into [[liquidation]] (sometimes referred to as winding-up). The directors and shareholders can instigate the liquidation process without court involvement by a shareholder resolution and the appointment of a licensed [[Insolvency Practitioner]] as liquidator. However, the liquidation will not be effective legally without the convening of a meeting of creditors who have the opportunity to appoint a liquidator of their own choice. This process is known as creditors voluntary liquidation (CVL), as opposed to members voluntary liquidation (MVL) which is for solvent companies. Alternatively, a creditor can petition the court for a winding-up order which, if granted, will place the company into what is called compulsory liquidation or winding up by the court. The liquidator realises the assets of the company and distributes funds realised to creditors according to their priorities, after the deduction of costs. In the case of [[Sole Trader Insolvency]], the insolvency options include [[Individual Voluntary Arrangements]] and [[Bankruptcy]].

====Procedures====
It can be a civil and even a criminal offence for directors to allow a company to continue to trade whilst insolvent. However, two new insolvency procedures were introduced by the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] which aim to provide time for the rescue of a company or, at least, its business. These are '''Administration''' and [[Company Voluntary Arrangement]]:

*'''Administration''' is a procedure to protect a company from its creditors in order for it to be able to make significant operational changes or restructuring so that it could continue as a going concern, or at least in order to achieve a better outcome for creditors than via liquidation. In contrast to Chapter 11 in the US where the directors remain in control throughout that restructuring process, in the UK an Administrator is appointed who must be a licensed [[Insolvency Practitioner]] to manage the company's affairs to protect the creditors of the insolvent company and balance their respective interests. Unless the company itself is saved by this process, the company is subsequently put into liquidation to distribute the remaining funds.
*A '''Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)''' is a legal agreement between the company and its creditors, based on paying a fixed amount lower than the outstanding actual debt. These are normally based on a monthly payment, and at the end of the agreed term the remaining debt is written-off. The CVA is managed by a Supervisor who must be a licensed [[Insolvency Practitioner]]. If the CVA fails, the company is usually put into liquidation.

One particular type of '''Administration''' that is becoming more common is called '''pre pack administration''' (more information under [[administration (law)]]). In this process, immediately after appointment the administrator completes a pre-arranged sale of the company's business, often to its directors or owners. The process can be seen as controversial because the creditors do not have the opportunity to vote against the sale. The rationale behind the device is that the swift sale of the business may be necessary or of benefit to enable a best price to be achieved. If the sale was delayed, creditors would ultimately lose out because the price obtainable for the assets would be reduced.

====Receivership====
In addition to the above-mentioned corporate insolvency procedures, a creditor holding security over an asset of the company may have the power to appoint an insolvency practitioner as administrative receiver or, in Scotland, receiver. The process, latterly known as [[administrative receivership]] or, in Scotland, receivership, has existed for many years and has often resulted in a successful rescue of a company's business via a sale, but not of the company itself. Since the introduction of the collective insolvency procedure of '''Administration''' in 1986, the legislators have decided to set a shelf life on the [[administrative receivership]] or, in Scotland, receivership procedure and it is no longer possible to appoint an administrative receiver or, in Scotland, receiver under security created after 15 September 2003.

In individual cases the bankruptcy estate is dealt by an official receiver, appointed by the court. In some cases the file is transferred to RTLU (OR Regional Trustee Liquidator Unit) that will assess your assets and income to see if you can contribute towards paying costs of bankruptcy or even discharge part of your debts.

===United States===
{{Main|Bankruptcy in the United States}}
Under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], a person is considered to be insolvent when the party has ceased to pay its debts in the [[ordinary course of business]], or cannot pay its debts as they become due, or is insolvent within the meaning of the [[Bankruptcy in the United States|Bankruptcy Code]]. This is important because certain rights under the code may be invoked against an insolvent party which are otherwise unavailable.

The [[United States]] has established insolvency regimes {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} which aim to protect the insolvent individual or company from the creditors, and balance their respective interests. For example, see [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code]]. However, some state courts have begun to find individual corporate officers and directors liable for driving a company deeper into bankruptcy, under the legal theory of "deepening insolvency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|last=Thompson
|first=David
|journal=Stanford Journal of Law, Business &amp; Finance
|volume=12
|issue=2
|pages=536
|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In determining whether a gift or a payment to a creditor is an unlawful preference, the date of the insolvency, rather than the date of the legally declared bankruptcy, will usually be the primary consideration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3337">The '''Institute of Certified Management Accountants''' ('''ICMA''') is an Australian organisation focused on management accounting, it differs from other Australian Accounting societies: [[CPA Australia]], [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia]], [[Institute of Public Accountants]] due to this focus.

==Overview==
The Institute has offices and members outside of Australia, in Asia, India, Lebanon, UK, UAE, Africa and Cyprus.

It features worldwide distribution of network education program, including China, India, Indonesia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Dubai, Singapore, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Canada and the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmawebline.org/joomla4/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=6&amp;28e5bbf660cb545fc854f5c048c7be7c=5e9dbd37c6c40d752354c4d1f4bd607e&lt;/ref&gt;  (Note that some countries have established CMA-equivalent organisations such as [[CMA Canada]] now [[Chartered Professional Accountant| CPA Canada]]  (Chartered Professional Accountants), [[ Institute of Cost Accountants of India| ICWAI India]]  and [[Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka| CMA Sri Lanka]].)

The proposed merger of CMA Australia  with [[Institute of Management Accountants| IMA (USA)]] abandoned in 2006.

Some discussion of becoming an [[International Federation of Accountants|IFAC]]  member.

There are four grades of membership (designations) within the Association: 

· Certified Management Accountant (CMA) - Requirements: Degree from a recognised university or Professional Qualification in Accounting, completion of CMA units and 5 years relevant experience

· Associate Management Accountant (AMA) - Requirements: Degree from a recognised university or Professional Qualification in Accounting and 3 years relevant experience

· Graduate Management Accountant (GMA) - Requirements: Degree from a recognised university or Professional Qualification in Accounting or completion of Graduate program

· Management Accounting Affiliate (MAA) - Open Entry for those interested in the field of Management Accountancy

The ICMA has joined as a founder and sponsoring member of IMACTM (the International Management Accounting CollaborativeTM) a senior academic research collaboration spanning many countries. Preliminary informal discussions have taken place on the IMACTM concept with CMA (Canada); ICWA (India) and CIMA (UK).

In June 2008, ICMA introduces "THE INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED CARBON ANALYSTS AND AUDITORS (ICCAA)".  The principal object of the ICCAA is therefore, to advance, promote, measure, regulate and provide assurance certification of carbon credits for the effective implementation of emissions trading systems aimed at encouraging participation in carbon credit markets by its members to improve environmental sustainability and provide solutions to reducing the greenhouse effect and resultant climate change.

'''Jean-Bernard Ndongo Essomba''' is a Cameroonian politician. He was President of the Parliamentary Group of the [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] (RDPC) in the [[National Assembly of Cameroon]] from 1992 to 1997 and he has held that post again since 2002.

==Political career before 2007==

Local elections were held in October 1987; they were notable for the fact that multiple RDPC lists were allowed to run in the same constituencies, thus providing a measure of political competition within the context of the single-party system. Ndongo Essomba headed a list in the rural commune of [[Sa'a, Cameroon|Sa'a]], located in the [[Centre Region, Cameroon|Centre Province]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=g4ixS-S5C8T38AbX1YnnAQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=H2AyAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=ndongo+essomba+1987&amp;q=ndongo+essomba+#search_anchor ''Elections municipales 1987''] (1988), page 170 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Cameroonian parliamentary election, 2002|June 2002 parliamentary election]], Ndongo Essomba again participated in the RDPC party primary in Lekié.&lt;ref name=Messager/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cavaye&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9978904_ITM "Cavaye Yeguie re-elected parliament speaker in Cameroon"], Panapress, 9 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary, held on 9&amp;ndash;10 May 2002,&lt;ref name=Messager/&gt; the list headed by Ndongo Essomba narrowly defeated the list led by Ntsimi;&lt;ref name=Primary/&gt;&lt;ref name=Messager/&gt; it received 2,587 votes against 2,505 for Ntsimi's list.&lt;ref name=Messager/&gt; After winning a seat in the National Assembly, Ndongo Essomba was elected as President of the RDPC Parliamentary Group when the National Assembly began meeting for its new term in August 2002.&lt;ref name=Cavaye/&gt;

==2007 election and subsequent events==
In the [[Cameroonian parliamentary election, 2007|July 2007 parliamentary election]], Ndongo Essomba was re-elected to the National Assembly as an RDPC candidate in Lekié East constituency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postnewsline.com/2007/08/members-of-parl.html "Members of Parliament Declared Elected at July 22, 2007 Elections by the Supreme Court"], ''The Post'', 13 August 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was retained in his post as President of the RDPC Parliamentary Group when the National Assembly began meeting for the new parliamentary term.&lt;ref&gt;Kini Nsom, [http://www.postnewsline.com/2007/09/confusion-in-pa.html "Confusion In Parliament As CPDM MP Challenges Cavaye"], ''The Post'', 3 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, when the National Assembly approved changes to the constitution that eliminated [[term limit]]s on the Presidency, thereby allowing President Biya to run for re-election in 2011, Ndongo Essomba said that the changes deserved "the enthusiastic support of all Cameroonians of good faith". He argued that they would "enhance democracy, maintain political stability, national unity and territorial integrity" and that they were "in tune with international accepted standards as practised in old democracies such as France and the United Kingdom". The constitutional changes were furiously denounced by the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Tansa Musa, [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL10840480 "Cameroon assembly clears way for Biya third term"], Reuters, 10 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marine protected areas''' (MPA) are [[protected area]]s of [[sea]]s, [[ocean]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] or large [[lake]]s. These marine areas can come in many forms ranging from wildlife refuges to research facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/mpa.html|title=What is a marine protect?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPAs restrict human activity for a conservation purpose, typically to protect natural or cultural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/ecosystems/mpa/ |title=Marine Protected Areas |website=[[National Ocean Service]] |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such marine resources are protected by local, state, territorial, native, regional, national, or international authorities and differ substantially among and between nations. This variation includes different limitations on development, fishing practices, fishing seasons and catch limits, moorings and bans on removing or disrupting marine life. In some situations (such as with the [[Phoenix Islands Protected Area]]), MPAs also provide revenue for countries, potentially equal to the income that they would have if they were to grant companies permissions to fish.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Magazine, January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 2016 in [[Hobart]], [[Australia]], the [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] agreed to establish the first [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] and largest marine protected area in the world encompassing 1.55 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (600,000 sq mi) in the [[Ross Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CCAMLR to create world's largest Marine Protected Area|url=https://www.ccamlr.org/en/news/2016/ccamlr-create-worlds-largest-marine-protected-area|accessdate=28 October 2016|agency=Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other large MPAs are in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s, in certain [[exclusive economic zone]]s of Australia and overseas territories of [[French overseas departments and territories|France]], the [[British Overseas Territories|United Kingdom]] and the [[Territories of the United States|United States]], with major ({{convert|990,000|km2|sqmi}} or larger) new or expanded MPAs by these nations since 2012&amp;mdash;such as [[Natural Park of the Coral Sea]], [[Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument]], Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Marine Protected Area]].&lt;!--- for lead, limit to one large post 2011 example from each named country ---&gt;  When counted with MPAs of all sizes from many other countries, as of August 2016 there are more than 13,650 MPAs, encompassing 2.07% of the world's oceans, with half of that area &amp;ndash; encompassing 1.03% of the world's oceans &amp;ndash; receiving complete "[[Marine protected area#Classifications|no-take"]] designation.&lt;ref name="MPAtlas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpatlas.org/explore/ |title=Explore |work=MPAtlas |publisher=[[Marine Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
"MPA" is an umbrella term for protected areas that includes some area of marine landscape and/or [[biodiversity]]. The [[IUCN]] defines a marine protected area as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Any area of the intertidal or subtidal terrain, together with its overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/pa/pa_what/?4646/Marine-Protected-Areas--Why-have-them/ |title=Marine protected areas, why have them? |publisher=IUCN |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2012-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319150803/http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/pa/pa_what/?4646%2FMarine-Protected-Areas--Why-have-them%2F |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;An alternative is "a clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated, and managed through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long term conservation of nature with associated [[ecosystem services]] and cultural values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/wcpa/wcpa_puball/wcpa_pubsubject/wcpa_marinepub/?2135/Towards-Networks-of-Marine-Protected-Areas-The-MPA-Plan-of-Action-for-IUCNs-World-Commission-on-Protected-Areas |title=Towards Networks of Marine Protected Areas - The MPA Plan of Action for IUCN’s World Commission on Protected Areas |publisher=IUCN |date=2008-11-04 |accessdate=2012-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522022607/http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/wcpa/wcpa_puball/wcpa_pubsubject/wcpa_marinepub/?2135%2FTowards-Networks-of-Marine-Protected-Areas-The-MPA-Plan-of-Action-for-IUCNs-World-Commission-on-Protected-Areas |archivedate=2012-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States Executive Order 13158 in May 2000 established MPAs, defining them as;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by federal, state, tribal, territorial, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cultural resources therein."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/02/03/2011-2327/nomination-of-existing-marine-protected-areas-to-the-national-system-of-marine-protected-areas-and/ |title=Nomination of Existing Marine Protected Areas to the National System of Marine Protected Areas and Updates to the List of National System Marine Protected Areas |publisher=Federalregister.gov |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] defined the broader term of ''marine and coastal protected area'' (MCPA);&lt;blockquote&gt;"Any defined area within or adjacent to the marine environment, together with its overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by legislation or other effective means, including custom, with the effect that its marine and/or coastal biodiversity enjoys a higher level of protection than its surroundings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marine Protected Areas (MPA) |url=http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/areas/46/ |title=Areas of Biodiversity Importance: Marine Protected Areas, 2010 |publisher=Biodiversitya-z.org |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Salomons Atoll in the Chagos.jpg|thumb|The [[Chagos Archipelago]] was declared the world's largest marine reserve in April 2010 with an area of 250,000 square miles until March 2015 when It was declared illegal by the Permanent Court of Arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=22001512/ Foreign and Commonwealth Office, New Protection for Marine Life, April, 2010]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702165420/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=22001512%2F |date=July 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Several types of compliant MPA can be distinguished:
*A totally marine area with no significant terrestrial parts.
*An area containing both marine and terrestrial components, which can vary between two extremes; those that are predominantly maritime with little land (for example, an [[atoll]] would have a tiny island with a significant maritime population surrounding it), or that is mostly terrestrial.
*Marine ecosystems that contain land and [[intertidal]] components only. For example, a [[mangrove forest]] would contain no open sea or ocean marine environment, but its river-like marine ecosystem nevertheless complies with the definition.

IUCN offered seven [[IUCN Protected Area Management Categories|categories of protected area]], based on management objectives and four broad governance types.

! Cat
! [[IUCN]] [[Protected Area Management Categories]]:
|-
| &lt;center&gt;'''Ia'''&lt;/center&gt;
| '''Strict nature reserve'''&lt;br&gt;A [[marine reserve]] usually connotes "maximum protection", where all resource removals are strictly prohibited. In countries such as [[Kenya]] and [[Belize]], marine reserves allow for low-risk removals to sustain local communities.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;'''Ib'''&lt;/center&gt;
| '''Wilderness area'''
|-
| &lt;center&gt;'''II'''&lt;/center&gt;
| '''[[National park]]'''&lt;br&gt;[[Marine park]]s emphasize the protection of ecosystems but allow light human use. A marine park may prohibit fishing or extraction of resources, but allow recreation. Some marine parks, such as those in [[Tanzania]], are zoned and allow activities such as fishing only in low risk areas.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;'''III'''&lt;/center&gt;

Related [[protected area]] categories include the following;

*[[World Heritage Site]] (WHS)&amp;nbsp;– an area exhibiting extensive natural or cultural history. Maritime areas are poorly represented, however, with only 46 out of over 800 sites.
*[[Man and the Biosphere]] – [[UNESCO]] program that promotes "a balanced relationship between humans and the [[biosphere]]". Under article 4, biosphere reserves must "encompass a mosaic of ecological systems", and thus combine terrestrial, coastal, or marine ecosystems. In structure they are similar to Multiple-use MPAs, with a core area ringed by different degrees of protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/man-and-biosphere-programme/ |title=Man and the Biosphere Programme |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar site]] – must meet [[Ramsar Classification System for Wetland Type|certain criteria for the definition of "Wetland"]] to become part of a global system. These sites do not necessarily receive protection, but are indexed by importance for later recommendation to an agency that could designate it a protected area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/ris/key_ris_e.pdf/ Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813143558/http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/ris/key_ris_e.pdf/ |date=August 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While "area" refers to a single contiguous location, terms such as '''"'''''network'''''"''', '''"'''''system'''''"''', and '''"'''''region'''''"''' that group MPAs are not always consistently employed.'''"'''''System'''''"''' is more often used to refer to an individual MPA, whereas '''"'''''region'''''"''' is defined by the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A collection of individual MPAs operating cooperatively, at various spatial scales and with a range of protection levels that are designed to meet objectives that a single reserve cannot achieve."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdpa-marine.org/MPAResources/MPAPlanningResources/Docs/Establishing%20resilient%20MPA%20networks-making%20it%20happen.pdf/ WDPA: Establishing Resilient Marine Protected Area Networks — Making It Happen, 2008] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the 2004 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the agency agreed to use '''"'''''network'''''"''' on a global level, while adopting ''system'' for national and regional levels. The ''network'' is a mechanism to establish regional and local systems, but carries no authority or mandate, leaving all activity within the '''"'''''system'''''"'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unepscs.org/Refugia_Training/Fisheries%20Refugia%20Concept/15-Differences-Similarities-of-Fisheries-Refugia-and-Marine-Protected-Areas.pdf/ UNEP: Marine Protected Areas and the Concept of Fisheries Refugia, 2006/]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''No take zones'' (NTZs), are areas designated in a number of the world's MPAs, where all forms of exploitation are prohibited and severely limits human activities. These no take zones can cover an entire MPA, or specific portions. For example, the {{convert|1,150,000|km2|sqmi}} [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]], the world's largest MPA (and largest protected area of any type, land or sea), is a 100% no take zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpatlas.org/mpa/sites/68808186/ |title=Papahānaumokuākea (Expansion) Marine National Monument, United States |work=MPAtlas |publisher=[[Marine Conservation Institute]] |accessdate=2016-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923124955/http://www.mpatlas.org/mpa/sites/68808186/ |archivedate=2016-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related terms include; ''specially protected area'' (SPA), ''[[Special Area of Conservation]]'' (SAC), the United Kingdom's ''marine conservation zones'' (MCZs),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/marine/protectandmanage/mpa/conservationzones.aspx/ |title=Marine Conservation Zones |publisher=Naturalengland.org.uk |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''area of special conservation'' (ASC) etc. which each provide specific restrictions.

== Stressors ==
Stressors that affect oceans include "the impact of [[extractive industries]], localised pollution, and changes to its chemistry ([[ocean acidification]]) resulting from elevated [[carbon dioxide]] levels, due to our [[greenhouse gas|emissions]]". MPAs have been cited as the ocean's single greatest hope for increasing the resilience of the marine environment to such stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Laffoley, D. d'A., (ed.) 2008. Towards Networks of Marine Protected Areas. The MPA Plan of Action for IUCN's World Commission on Protected Areas. IUCN WCPA, Gland, Switzerland. 28 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Well-designed and managed MPAs developed with input and support from interested stakeholders can conserve biodiversity and protect and restore [[fisheries]].

== Economics ==
MPAs can help sustain local economies by supporting fisheries and tourism.  For example, [[Apo Island]] in the [[Philippines]] made protected one quarter of their reef, allowing fish to recover, jumpstarting their economy. This was shown in the film, ''Resources at Risk: Philippine Coral Reef''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;Christie, P. and A.T. White. 2007. Best practices for improved governance of coral reef marine protected areas. Coral Reefs 26:1047-1056.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 report by the [[Center for Development and Strategy]] found that programs like the [[United States National Marine Sanctuary]] system can develop considerable economic benefits for communities through [[Public–private partnership]]s.&lt;ref name="Joint-Value Creation Between Marine Protected Areas and the Private Sector"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harary|first1=David|title=Joint-Value Creation Between Marine Protected Areas and the Private Sector|url=http://www.thinkcds.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Final_MPA_Harary.pdf|website=thinkcds.org|publisher=Center for Development and Strategy|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==

Typical MPAs restrict [[fishing]], [[Petrochemicals|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] mining and/or [[tourism]]. Other restrictions may limit the use of [[ultrasonics|ultrasonic]] devices like [[sonar]] (which may confuse the guidance system of [[cetaceans]]), development, construction and the like. Some fishing restrictions include "no-take" zones, which means that no fishing is allowed. Less than 1% of US MPAs are no-take.

Ship transit can also be restricted or banned, either as a preventive measure or to avoid direct disturbance to individual species. The degree to which environmental regulations affect shipping varies according to whether MPAs are located in [[territorial waters]], [[exclusive economic zone]]s, or the [[high seas]]. The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|law of the sea]] regulates these limits.

Most MPAs have been located in territorial waters, where the appropriate government can enforce them. However, MPAs have been established in exclusive economic zones and in [[international waters]]. For example, Italy, France and Monaco in 1999 jointly established a cetacean sanctuary in the [[Ligurian Sea]] named the [[Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals]]. This sanctuary includes both national and international waters. Both the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] and [[IUCN]] recommended a variety of management systems for use in a protected area system. They advocated that MPAs be seen as one of many "nodes" in a network of protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/marine-protected-areas_470.html/ |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111220214403/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/marine-protected-areas_470.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-12-20 |title=Marine Protected Area Networks |publisher=Unep-Wcmc |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2012-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are the most common management systems:

[[File:Asinara-Island01.jpg|thumb|right|Asinara, Italy is listed by WDPA as both a marine reserve and a national marine park, and as such could be labelled 'multiple-use'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Area_Naturale_Marina_Protetta_Isola_Dell_Asinara_Natural_Marine_Reserve_And_Natural_Protected_Marine_Areas/ |title=Asinara Natural Marine Reserve |publisher=Protectedplanet.net |accessdate=2012-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608184308/http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Area_Naturale_Marina_Protetta_Isola_Dell_Asinara_Natural_Marine_Reserve_And_Natural_Protected_Marine_Areas |archivedate=2012-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Seasonal and temporary management'''—Activities, most critically fishing, are restricted seasonally or temporarily, e.g., to protect spawning/nursing grounds or to let a rapidly reducing species recover.

'''Multiple-use MPAs'''—These are the most common and arguably the most effective. These areas employ two or more protections. The most important sections get the highest protection, such as a no take zone and are surrounded with areas of lesser protections.

'''Community involvement and related approaches'''—Community-managed MPAs empower local communities to operate partially or completely independent of the governmental jurisdictions they occupy. Empowering communities to manage resources can lower conflict levels and enlist the support of diverse groups that rely on the resource such as subsistence and commercial fishers, scientists, recreation, tourism businesses, youths and others.

===Marine Protected Area Networks===
{{main|Marine Protected Area Network}}
'''Marine Protected Area Networks''' or '''MPA networks''' have been defined as "A group of MPAs that interact with one another ecologically and/or socially form a network".&lt;ref name="Christie, P. 2007"&gt;Christie, P., and A. T. White. "Best Practices for Improved Governance of Coral Reef Marine Protected Areas." Coral Reefs 26.4 (2007): 1047-056. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

These networks are intended to connect individuals and MPAs and promote education and cooperation among various administrations and user groups. "MPA networks are, from the perspective of resource users, intended to address both environmental and socio-economic needs, complementary ecological and social goals and designs need greater research and policy support".&lt;ref name="Christie, P. 2007" /&gt;

Filipino communities connect with one another to share information about MPAs, creating a larger network through the social communities' support.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry, G. K., A. T. White, and P. Christie. "Scaling Up to Networks of Marine Protected Areas in the Philippines: Biophysical, Legal, Institutional, and Social Considerations." Coastal Management 37.3 (2009): 274-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging or established MPA networks can be found in [[Commonwealth marine reserves#Commonwealth marine reserve networks|Australia]], Belize, the [[Red Sea]], [[Gulf of Aden]] and Mexico.&lt;ref name="Christie, P. 2007" /&gt;

==International efforts==

The 17th [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) General Assembly in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California, the 19th IUCN assembly and the fourth World Parks Congress all proposed to centralise the establishment of protected areas. The [[Earth Summit 2002|World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in 2002 called for {{quote|the establishment of marine protected areas consistent with international laws and based on scientific information, including representative networks by 2012.&lt;ref name="Wells13"&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|Sheppard|van Lavieren|Barnard|2008|p=13|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Evian agreement, signed by [[G8|G8 Nations]] in 2003, agreed to these terms. The Durban Action Plan, developed in 2003, called for regional action and targets to establish a network of protected areas by 2010 within the jurisdiction of regional [[Environmental science|environmental protocols]].It recommended establishing protected areas for 20 to 30% of the world's oceans by the goal date of 2012. The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] considered these recommendations and recommended requiring countries to set up marine parks controlled by a central organization before merging them. The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] agreed to the terms laid out by the convention, and in 2004, its member nations committed to the following targets;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/nationalregional08well|title=National and Regional Networks of Marine Protected Areas: A Review of Progress|first=S.|last=Wells|date=23 May 2018|publisher=UNEP-WCMC / UNEP|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*By 2006 complete an area system gap analysis at national and regional levels.
*By 2008 address the less represented marine ecosystems, accounting for those beyond national jurisdiction in accordance.
*By 2009 designate the protected areas identified through the gap analysis.
*By 2012 complete the establishment of a comprehensive and ecologically representative network.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The establishment by 2010 of terrestrial and by 2012 for marine areas of '''comprehensive, effectively managed, and ecologically representative national and regional systems of protected areas''' that collectively, inter alia through a global network, contribute to achieving the three objectives of the Convention and the 2010 target to significantly reduce the current late of [[biodiversity loss]] at the global, regional, national, and sub-national levels and contribute to poverty reduction and the pursuit of sustainable development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/?id=7765/ |title=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Decision VII/28 |publisher=Cbd.int |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The UN later endorsed another decision, Decision VII/15, in 2006:
{{quote|Effective conservation of 10% of each of the world's ecological regions by 2010.&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt; – [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] Decision VII/15&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/?id=7752/ |title=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Decision VII/15 |publisher=Cbd.int |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Global treaties===
====United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea====

====The Antarctic Treaty System====
On 7 April 1982, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CAMLR Convention) came into force after discussions began in 1975 between parties of the then-current [[Antarctic Treaty]] to limit large-scale exploitation of [[krill]] by commercial fisheries. The Convention bound contracting nations to abide by previously agreed upon Antarctic territorial claims and peaceful use of the region while protecting ecosystem integrity south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]] and [[60th parallel south|60 S latitude]]. In so doing, it also established a commission of the original signatories and acceding parties called the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to advance these aims through protection, scientific study, and rational use, such as harvesting, of those marine resources. Though separate, the Antarctic Treaty and CCAMLR, make up part the broader system of international agreements called the Antarctic Treaty System. Since 1982, the CCAMLR meets annually to implement binding conservations measures like the creation of 'protected areas' at the suggestion of the convention's scientific committee.

In 2009, the CCAMLR created the first 'high-seas' MPA entirely within international waters over the southern shelf of the [[South Orkney Islands]]. This area encompasses {{convert|94,000|km2|sqmi}} and all fishing activity including transhipment, and dumping or discharge of waste is prohibited with the exception of scientific research endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of the South Orkney Islands southern shelf|url=https://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-91-03-2009|website=https://www.ccamlr.org|publisher=Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 2016, the CCAMLR, composed of 24 member countries and the European Union at the time, agreed to establish the world's largest marine park encompassing 1.55 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (600,000 sq mi) in the Ross Sea after several years of failed negotiations. Establishment of the Ross Sea MPA required unanimity of the commission members and enforcement will begin in December 2017. However, due to a sunset provision inserted into the proposal, the new marine park will only be in force for 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CCAMLR to create world's largest Marine Protected Area|url=https://www.ccamlr.org/en/news/2016/ccamlr-create-worlds-largest-marine-protected-area|accessdate=29 October 2016|publisher=Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Targets===

Many countries have established national targets, accompanied by action plans and implementations. The UN Council identified the need for countries to collaborate with each other to establish effective regional conservation plans.

==National efforts==

The marine protected area network is still in its infancy. As of October 2010, approximately 6,800 MPAs had been established, covering 1.17% of global ocean area.

====South Africa====

[[Image:TMNP MPA boundaries.png|thumb|360px|Boundaries of the Table Mountain National Park Marine Protected Area (yellow) and the associated restricted areas (orange).]]

The '''Table Mountain National Park Marine Protected Area''' is a [[marine protected area]] around the [[Cape Peninsula]], in the vicinity of [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]  It was proclaimed in Government Gazette No. 26431 of 4 June 2004 in terms of the [[Marine Natural Resources Act, 18 of 1998]].&lt;ref name="Gazette 26431" &gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/library/mpa_gove_note.pdf |date=4 June 2004 |title=Government Notice 695: Marine Living Resources Act (18/1998): Notice declaring the Table Mountain National Park Marine Protected Area under section 43 |journal=Government Gazette |pages=3-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPA is of value for [[conservation]] of a wide range of [[Endemism|endemic]] species, and has considerable economic value as a tourist destination. It encloses a large number of [[recreational dive sites]] visited by local residents and tourists from further afield. The shark and [[whale watching]] tourist industries are also represented, and there are several popular [[Surfing|surf breaks]]. The MPA includes controlled zones where extractive activities are allowed under permit, and smaller no-take zones. The MPA is administrated by the [[Table Mountain National Park]], a branch of [[South African National Parks|SANParks]]. 

The marine ecology is unusually varied for an area of this size, as a result of the meeting of two major oceanic water masses near [[Cape Point]], and the park extends into two coastal marine [[bioregion]]s. The ecology of the west or "Atlantic Seaboard" side of the park is noticeably different in character and [[biodiversity]] to that of the east, or "False Bay" side. Both sides are classified as temperate waters, but there is a significant difference in average temperature, with the Atlantic side being noticeably colder.&lt;ref name="MPA Forum" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://mpaforum.org.za/portfolio/table-mountain-national-park-mpa-2/ |title=Table Mountain National Park |author=&lt;!--not specified--&gt; |website=MPA Forum South Africa |accessdate=26 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPA contains culturally significant fish traps, historicalwrecks and traditional fishing communities, and is also important for commercial fisheries. Part of the  West Coast rock lobster industry takes place within the MPA – as well as recreational and subsistence fishers, and an illegal poaching industry mostly targeting abalone, rock lobster and territorial linefish from the no-take zones.&lt;ref name="MPA Forum" /&gt;

===Greater Caribbean===

[[File:Location Caribbean.png|thumb|300px|The [[Caribbean]] region; the UNEP–defined region also includes the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. This region is encompassed by the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]] proposal, and the Caribbean challenge]]
[[File:GulfofMexico3D.jpg|thumb|The [[Gulf of Mexico]] region (in 3D) is encompassed by the "Islands in the Stream" proposal.]]
The [[Caribbean|Greater Caribbean]] subdivision encompasses an area of about {{convert|5700000|km2}} of ocean and 38 nations. The area includes island countries like the [[Bahamas]] and [[Cuba]], and the majority of [[Central America]]. The Convention for Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (better known as the [[Curitiba#UN Convention on Biodiversity|Cartagena Convention]]) was established in 1983. [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety|Protocols involving protected areas]] were ratified in 1990. As of 2008, the region hosted about 500 MPAs. [[Coral reef]]s are the best represented.

Two networks are under development, the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]] (a long [[Coral reef|barrier reef]] that borders the coast of much of Central America), and the "Islands in the Stream" program (covering the [[Gulf of Mexico]]).&lt;ref name="Wells33"&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|Sheppard|van_Lavieren|Barnard|2008|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southeast Asia===
Southeast Asia is a global epicenter for marine diversity. 12% of its coral reefs are in MPAs. The Philippines have some the world's best coral reefs and protect them to attract international tourism. Most of the Philippines' MPAs are established to secure protection for its coral reef and [[sea grass]] habitats. Indonesia has MPAs designed for tourism and relies on tourism as a main source of income.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

==== Philippines ====
The [[Philippines]] host one of the most highly biodiverse regions, with 464 reef-building coral species. Due to overfishing, destructive fishing techniques, and rapid coastal development, these are in rapid decline. The country has established some 600 MPAs. However, the majority are poorly enforced and are highly ineffective. However, some have positively impacted reef health, increased fish biomass, decreased coral bleaching and increased yields in adjacent fisheries. One notable example is the MPA surrounding Apo Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reefbase.org/key_topics/pdf/Philippines%20mpa.pdf|title=Summary Report for MPAs in the Philippines|author=|date=|website=reefbase.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===

[[Latin America]] has designated one large MPA system. As of 2008, 0.5% of its marine environment was protected, mostly through the use of small, multiple-use MPAs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|Sheppard|van_Lavieren|Barnard|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Pacific===

The South Pacific network ranges from [[Belize]] to [[Chile]]. Governments in the region adopted the [[List of international environmental agreements#Marine environment – global conventions|Lima convention]] and action plan in 1981. An MPA-specific protocol was ratified in 1989. The permanent commission on the exploitation and conservation on the marine resources of the South Pacific promotes the exchange of studies and information among participants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The region is currently running one comprehensive cross-national program, the Tropical Eastern Pacific Marine Corridor Network, signed in April 2004. The network covers about {{convert|211000000|km2}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

One alternative to imposing MPAs on an indigenous population is through the use of [[Indigenous Protected Areas]], such as those in Australia.

===North Pacific===

The North Pacific network covers the western coasts of Mexico, Canada, and the U.S. The "Antigua Convention" and an action plan for the north Pacific region were adapted in 2002. Participant nations manage their own national systems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 2010-2011, the State of California completed hearings and actions via the state Department of Fish and Game to establish new MPAs.{{Citation needed|date = December 2014}}

===United States and Pacific Island Territories===
President [[Barack Obama]] signed a proclamation on September 25, 2014, designating the world's largest marine reserve. The proclamation expanded the existing [[Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument]], one of the world's most pristine tropical marine environments, to six times its current size, encompassing {{Convert|490000|sqmi}} of protected area around these islands. Expanding the Monument protected the area's unique deep coral reefs and seamounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/24/fact-sheet-president-obama-designate-largest-marine-monument-world-limit President Obama Designates Largest Marine Monument] 25 Sept 2014 Retrieved 25 Sept 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, the US established a [[United States National System of Marine Protected Areas]], which strengthens the protection of US ocean, coastal and [[Great Lakes]] resources. These large-scale MPAs should balance "the interests of conservationists, fishers, and the public."&lt;ref name="Christie, P. 2007"/&gt; As of 2009, 225 MPAs participated in the national system.

* Has a management plan (can be sitespecific or part of a broader programmatic management plan; must have goals and objectives and call for monitoring or evaluation of those goals and objectives).
* Contributes to at least one priority conservation objective as listed in the Framework.
* Cultural heritage MPAs must also conform to criteria for the National Register for Historic Places."&lt;ref name="thefederalregister.com" /&gt;
In 1999, California adopted the [[Marine Life Protection Act]], establishing the first state law requiring a comprehensive, science-based MPA network. The state created the [[Marine Life Protection Act|Marine Life Protection Act Initiative]]. The MLPA Blue Ribbon Task Force and stakeholder and scientific advisory groups ensure that the process uses the science and public participation.

The MLPA Initiative established a plan to create California's statewide MPA network by 2011 in several steps. The Central Coast step was successfully completed in September, 2007.  The North Central Coast step was completed in 2010.  The South Coast and North Coast steps were expected to go into effect in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Fish and Game.

===Indian Ocean===
In exchange for some of its [[Government debt|national debt]] being written off, the [[Seychelles]] designates two new [[marine protected area]]s in the [[Indian Ocean]], covering about {{convert|210000|km2|mi2|}}. It is the result of a financial deal, brokered in 2016 by [[The Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-43154686|title=Seychelles starts 'Britain-sized' reserve|author=|date=22 February 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-02-seychelles-huge-marine-reserve.html|title=Seychelles designates huge new marine reserve|author=|date=|website=phys.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

The [[Natura 2000]] [[ecological network|ecological MPA network]] in the [[European Union]] included MPAs in the [[North Atlantic]], the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]]. The member states had to define NATURA 2000 areas at sea in their [[Exclusive Economic Zone]].

Two assessments, conducted thirty years apart, of three Mediterranean MPAs, demonstrate that proper protection allows commercially valuable and slow-growing red coral ([[Corallium rubrum]]) to produce large colonies in shallow water of less than {{convert|50|m}}. Shallow-water colonies outside these decades-old MPAs are typically very small.

Managers and scientists use [[geographic information system]]s and [[remote sensing]] to map and analyze MPAs. NOAA Coastal Services Center compiled an "Inventory of GIS-Based Decision-Support Tools for MPAs." The report focuses on GIS tools with the highest utility for MPA processes.&lt;ref name="mpa.gov"/&gt; Remote sensing uses advances in [[aerial photography]] [[image capture]], [[pop-up archival satellite tag]]s, [[satellite imagery]], acoustic data, and [[radar imagery]]. Mathematical models that seek to reflect the complexity of the natural setting may assist in planning harvesting strategies and sustaining fishing grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berezansky|first=L.|last2=Idels|first2=L.|last3=Kipnis|first3=M.|date=2011|title=Mathematical model of marine protected areas|url=http://imamat.oxfordjournals.org/content/76/2/312|journal=IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics|language=en|volume=76|issue=2|pages=312–325|doi=10.1093/imamat/hxq043|issn=0272-4960|id=Preprint: http://hdl.handle.net/10613/2741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coral reefs ==
Coral reef systems have been in decline worldwide. Causes include overfishing, pollution and [[ocean acidification]]. As of 2013 30% of the world's reefs were severely damaged. Approximately 60% will be lost by 2030 without enhanced protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pandolfi|first=J.M.|title=Global trajectories of long-term decline of coral reef ecosystems|journal=Science|volume=301|year=2003|issue=5635|pages=955–958|doi=10.1126/science.1085706 |display-authors=etal|pmid=12920296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine reserves with "no take zones" are the most effective form of protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=T.P.|title=Climate change, human impacts, and the resilience of coral reefs|journal=Science|volume=301|year=2003|issue=5635|pages=929–933| doi=10.1126/science.1085046 |display-authors=etal|pmid=12920289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only about 0.01% of the world's coral reefs are inside effective MPAs.&lt;ref name="MoraScience2006"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20015.pdf | author=Mora C. | year=2006 | title=Coral reefs and the global network of Marine Protected Areas | journal=Science | volume = 312 | issue=5781 | pages = 1750–1751 |format=PDF| pmid=16794065 | author2=Andrèfouët, S | author3=Costello, M.

== Fish ==
MPAs can be an effective tool to maintain fish populations; see [[refuge (ecology)]]. The general concept is to create overpopulation within the MPA. The fish expand into the surrounding areas to reduce crowding, increasing the population of unprotected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innri.unuftp.is/pdf/Marine%20Protected%20Areas.pdf|title=Marine Protected Areas (Innri)|author=|date=|website=unuftp.is}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helps support local fisheries in the surrounding area, while maintaining a healthy population within the MPA. Such MPAs are most commonly used for coral reef ecosystems.

One example is at Goat Island Bay in New Zealand, established in 1977. Research gathered at Goat Bay documented the spillover effect. "Spillover and larval export—the drifting of millions of eggs and larvae beyond the reserve—have become central concepts of marine conservation". This positively impacted commercial fishermen in surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;Warne, Kennedy. [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/04/table-of-contents] "Saving the Sea's Bounty"] National Geographic. April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another unexpected result of MPAs is their impact on predatory marine species, which in some conditions can increase in population. When this occurs, prey populations decrease. One study showed that in 21 out of 39 cases, "trophic cascades," caused a decrease in herbivores, which led to an increase in the quantity of plant life. (This occurred in the Malindi Kisite and Watamu Marian National Parks in Kenya; the Leigh Marine Reserve in New Zealand; and Brackett's Landing Conservation Area in the US.&lt;ref&gt;MPA News, [https://mpanews.openchannels.org/mpanews/issue/july-2004-61 Vol. 6 No. 1, July 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Success criteria ==
Both [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] and [[IUCN]] have criteria for setting up and maintaining MPA networks, which emphasize 4 factors:&lt;ref name="Wells17"&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|Sheppard|van_Lavieren|Barnard|2008|p=17}}
The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] defines a ''protected area'' as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated, and managed, through legal or effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem service and cultural value."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Adequacy'''—ensuring that the sites have the size, shape, and distribution to ensure the success of selected species.
*'''Representability'''—protection for all of the local environment's biological processes
*'''Resilience'''—the resistance of the system to natural disaster, such as a tsunami or flood.
*'''Connectivity'''—maintaining population links across nearby MPAs.

== Misconceptions ==
Misconceptions about MPAs include the belief that all MPAs are no-take or no-fishing areas. However, less than 1 percent of US waters are no-take areas. MPA activities can include consumption fishing, diving and other activities.

Another misconception is that most MPAs are federally managed. Instead, MPAs are managed under hundreds of laws and jurisdictions. They can be exist in state, commonwealth, territory and tribal waters.

Another misconception is that a federal mandate dedicates a set percentage of ocean to MPAs. Instead the mandate requires an evaluation of current MPAs and creates a public resource on current MPAs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpa.gov/pdf/helpful-resources/factsheets/mpamisconceptions2.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215150109/http://mpa.gov/pdf/helpful-resources/factsheets/mpamisconceptions2.pdf |date=February 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some existing and proposed MPAs have been criticized by indigenous populations and their supporters, as impinging on land usage rights. For example, the proposed Chagos Protected Area in the Chagos Islands is contested by [[Chagossians]] deported from their homeland in 1965 by the [[United Kingdom|British]] as part of the creation of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT). According to [[WikiLeaks]] [[CableGate]] documents,&lt;ref name="[http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2010/12/23/18667425.php]"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2010/12/23/18667425.php |title=WikiLeaks reveals U.S., British use marine reserves as tool of imperialism |accessdate=2010-12-24 |date=2009-05-15 |work=Embassy London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UK proposed that the BIOT become a "marine reserve" with the aim of preventing the former inhabitants from returning to their lands and to protect the joint UK/US military base on [[Diego Garcia]] Island.

Other critiques include: their cost (higher than that of passive management), conflicts with human development goals, inadequate scope to address factors such as climate change and invasive species.&lt;ref name="MoraAndSale2011" /&gt;

== Recent research ==
[[File:Zebrasoma flavescens Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|right|The larvae of the [[yellow tang]] can drift more than 100 miles and reseed in a distant location.&lt;ref name=Christie2010 /&gt;]]

In 2010, one study found that [[fish larvae]] can drift on ocean currents and reseed [[fish stock]]s at a distant location. This finding demonstrated that fish populations can be connected to distant locations through the process of larval drift.&lt;ref name=Christie2010&gt;Christie MR, Tissot BN, Albins MA, Beets3 JP, Jia Y, Ortiz DL, Thompson SE, Hixon MA (2010) [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015715 Larval Connectivity in an Effective Network of Marine Protected Areas] ''PLoS ONE'', '''5'''(12) {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0015715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They investigated the [[yellow tang]], because larva of this species stay in the general area of the reef in which they first settle.&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily /&gt; The tropical yellow tang is heavily fished by the [[aquarium]] trade. By the late 1990s, their stocks were collapsing. Nine MPAs were established off the coast of Hawaii to protect them. Larval drift has helped them establish themselves in different locations, and the fishery is recovering.&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily /&gt; "We've clearly shown that fish larvae that were spawned inside marine reserves can drift with currents and replenish fished areas long distances away," said coauthor Mark Hixon.&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101222173105.htm Drifting Fish Larvae Allow Marine Reserves to Rebuild Fisheries] ''ScienceDaily '', 26 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Merryle Stanley Rukeyser''' (January 3, 1897 – December 21, 1988), was an American journalist and educator in finance and economics.

==Biography==
Rukeyser was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_17179.html Jewish Virtual Library: RUKEYSER, MERRYLE STANLEY] [[Jewish Virtual Library]] retrieved July 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; family in [[Chicago]] and grew up in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/22/obituaries/merryle-s-rukeyser-financial-columnist-and-an-editor-91.html New York Times: "Merryle S. Rukeyser, Financial Columnist And an Editor, 91" By GLENN FOWLER] December 22, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Columbia University]]'s Pulitzer school in 1915, and four years later received a master's degree in economics also from Columbia.

[[File:Research Center Kannapolis NC.jpg|thumb|right|David H. Murdock Core Laboratory on the North Carolina Research Campus]]
The '''North Carolina Research Campus''' (NCRC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncresearchcampus.net|title=North Carolina Research Campus}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a public-private research center in [[Kannapolis]], [[North Carolina]], [[United States]].  The Campus was envisioned by [[David H. Murdock]], owner of [[Dole Food Company]] and Castle and Cooke, Inc., as a center for improving human health through research into nutrition and agriculture. The campus was formed and operates as a partnership with the State of [[North Carolina]] and the [[University of North Carolina]] system.

The scientists at the NC Research Campus are known for research that explores the health benefits of plant [[phytochemical]]s, nutrients such as [[choline]] and the impact of nutrition and exercise on human performance. Research also involves the study of nutrients and plant-based compounds to prevent [[chronic diseases]] such as cancer and diabetes.

== About ==
[[File:NC Research Campus logo 2013.png|frameless|right]]
The North Carolina Research Campus is located in Kannapolis, NC, near Charlotte. As a scientific community of eight universities, the David H. Murdock Research Institute, global companies and entrepreneurs, the shared mission is to improve human health through nutrition. Research and development focuses on safer, more nutritious crops, healthier foods and precision nutrition.

== History ==

{{Prose|section|date=November 2017}}
* '''1982''' [[David H. Murdock]], chairman and owner of [[Dole Food Company]] bought the textile mill then known as [[Cannon Mills]], the largest manufacturer of home textiles in the world.
* '''1986'''  Murdock's firm Pacific Holding Company sells the mill. Murdock retains substantial property holdings in Kannapolis. The mill later became known as Fieldcrest Cannon and later Pillowtex.
* '''2003''' [[Pillowtex Corporation]] files for bankruptcy in 2003, and the mill closes. This results in the largest mass layoff of workers in North Carolina history.
* '''2005'''  Along with support from the state of North Carolina and the University of North Carolina system, Murdock announces the establishment of the North Carolina Research Campus.
* '''2006'''  Murdock acquires the Pillowtex site and demolishes the mill. Construction starts quickly on the North Carolina Research Campus after the six-million-square-foot textile mill is demolished.
* '''2008'''  The first building, the 311,000 square-foot David H. Murdock Research Core Laboratory, opens along with the [[North Carolina State University]] Plants for Human Health Institute building and the [[UNC Chapel Hill]] Nutrition Research Institute building.
* '''2012''' The headquarters of the Cabarrus Health Alliance, the regional public health authority, opens.
* '''2013''' A 60,000 square foot Class A medical office building opens with Carolinas Healthcare System as the main tenant.
* '''2015'''  In November, Mark Spitzer is chosen by Murdock to be the new Vice President of Operations for Castle &amp; Cooke North Carolina. In December, Kannapolis dedicates the City Hall &amp; Police Headquarters, a 100,000 square-foot facility standing opposite the David H. Murdock Core Laboratory, on land donated by Murdock.
* '''2016'''  BioArmor, a company that employs nanotechnology to produce hand sanitizers that do not use alcohol leases space in the David H. Murdock Core Laboratory. Discovery MS, a non-profit research initiative housed in the David H. Murdock Research Institute, launches with an announcement of several ongoing multiple sclerosis research projects. Ei, A Pharmaceutical Solutionworks™ begins moving a 24-person research and development team, known as Endev Laboratories, into a 10,000-square-foot laboratory with office space on the third floor of the building.
* '''2017'''  Ideal Health Biotechnology opens its first office at the North Carolina Research Campus. Klear Optix joins the North Carolina Research Campus.  Catawba College joins in partnership with the North Carolina Research Campus to assist with marketing and business development projects. The Standard Process Center for Excellence is announced and will open in 2019 on the first floor of the laboratory building. The North Carolina Food Processing &amp; Innovation Center, a partnership with the NC State and the NC Department of Agriculture, is announced as another tenant in the building.

The expression " operating lease" is somewhat confusing as it has a different meaning based on the context that is under consideration.
From a product characteristic stand point, this type of a lease, as distinguished from a finance lease, is one where the lessor takes residual risk. As such, the lease is non full payout. From an accounting stand point, this type of lease (if it fails to meet varied criteria that define a finance lease) results in off balance sheet financing.

The determination of whether a lease is a finance (also called capital) lease or an operating lease from an accounting point of view is defined in the United States by [http://www.fasb.org/pdf/fas13.pdf Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 (FAS 13)]. In countries covered by [[International Financial Reporting Standards]], the tests are defined in [http://www.ifrs.org/Documents/IAS17.pdf IAS 17]. In July 2006, the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) and the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) announced the commencement of a joint project to comprehensively reconsider lease accounting. In July 2008, the boards decided to defer any changes to lessor accounting, while continuing with the project for lessee accounting, with the stated intention to recognise an asset and liability for all lessee leases (in essence, eliminating operating lease accounting). This culminated in the issuance of IFRS 16 and FASB Topic 842. Both are effective January 1,2019.The similarity in the two pronouncements is that leases, which previously qualified as operating leases- and hence resulted in off balance sheet treatment, are now to be capitalized by the lessee.

Unlike a finance lease, at the end of the operating lease the title to the asset does not pass to the lessee, but remains with the lessor. Accordingly, at the end of an operating lease, the lessee has several options:

*Return of the equipment
*Renewal of the lease 
*Purchase of the equipment

Operating leases, where the lessor takes a residual position, offer a host of benefits to the lessee the type of which finance leases do not

'''Rolling-wave planning''' is the process of [[project planning]] in ''waves'' as the project proceeds and later details become clearer; similar to the techniques used in [[agile software development]] approaches like [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]]..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Agile and Iterative Development: A Manager's Guide | last=Larman | first=Craig | year=2004 |page=253 | chapter=Chapter 11: Practice Tips |  ISBN=9780131111554 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76rnV5Exs50C&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;ots=o8--YqDPRX&amp;dq=adaptive%20predictive%20%22rolling%20wave%22&amp;pg=PA253#v=onepage&amp;q=adaptive%20predictive%20%22rolling%20wave%22&amp;f=false | accessdate=Oct 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Work to be done in the near term is based on high-level assumptions; also, high-level milestones are set. As the project progresses, the risks, assumptions, and milestones originally identified become more defined and reliable. One would use rolling-wave planning in an instance where there is an extremely tight schedule or timeline to adhere to; whereas more thorough planning would have placed the schedule into an unacceptable negative schedule variance.

The concepts of rolling-wave planning and progressive elaboration are techniques covered in the [[Project Management Body of Knowledge]] &lt;ref name="Project Management Book Of Knowledge6.1.2.2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketplace.pmi.org/Pages/ProductDetail.aspx?GMProduct=00101388701|title="A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge ( PMBOK® Guide )—Fifth Edition", section 6.2.2.2 pg. 152|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Sports Legends Museum at Camden Yards''' was a non-profit sports museum in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]], owned and operated by the [[Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum|Babe Ruth Birthplace &amp; Museum]]. It opened on May 14, 2005, with the daughter of celebrated baseball player [[Babe Ruth]] in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stiehm|first=Jamie|date=May 15, 2005|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-05-15/news/0505150018_1_babe-ruth-museum-legends-museum-legends-at-camden|title=Sports history hits home at museum|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|page=1B|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ten years of operation the museum closed abruptly on October 12, 2015 after failing to reach an agreement with the [[Maryland Stadium Authority]] for the continued use of Camden Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-sports-legends-museum-closes-20151012-story.html|title = Sports Legends Museum closes its doors|last = Sherman|first = Natalie|last2 = Encina|first2 = Eduardo A.|date = 2015-10-12|work = The Baltimore Sun|first3 = Jeff| last3 = Barker|access-date = 2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|22000|sqft|0|sing=on}} museum was adjacent to the main gate of [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] and had artifacts and interactive exhibits profiling Maryland’s sports history. Exhibits included such area teams as the [[Baltimore Orioles]], [[Baltimore Ravens]], [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]], [[Maryland Terrapins]], [[Baltimore Elite Giants]], [[Baltimore Black Sox]], and the [[Baltimore Blast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyght|first=Daniel|date=July 28, 2004| title=Camden Yards expansion gives Ruth Museum a place to grow|work=The Baltimore Sun|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-07-28/sports/0407280228_1_babe-ruth-birthplace-camden-yards-ruth-museum|page=1C|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The museum was housed in the former [[Camden Station]], originally constructed in 1857 by the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&amp;O) as its main passenger station in Baltimore. After being vacant since the 1980s, the depot's exterior was restored in the 1990s as part of the development of the [[Camden Yards Sports Complex]]. Later interior renovations and remodeling were made to accommodate the building's adaptive reuse as a sports museum. [[Geppi's Entertainment Museum]], which opened in September 2006, is located on the upper level of the building, directly above where Sports Legends at Camden Yards was. The nearby Babe Ruth Birthplace &amp; Museum remains in existence as a separate museum on Emory Street, two and a half blocks from Camden Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sports Legends has Moved Out|url=http://baberuthmuseum.org/sports-legends-moving/|website=Babe Ruth Birthplace and Sports Legends Museums|publisher=Babe Ruth Birthplace Foundation, Inc.|date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A replica of the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] from [[Super Bowl V]] is part of the museum's collection.&lt;ref name="Simers"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simers|first1=T.J.|authorlink1=T. J.

That trophy stayed in the city of Baltimore's possession, and was placed in the Sports Legends Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baberuthmuseum.org/exhibit/almost-religion-baltimores-colts/|title=Almost Religion: Baltimore's Colts|website=Babe Ruth Birthplace and Sports Legends Museums|publisher=Babe Ruth Birthplace Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sweethearting''' in the [[retail loss prevention]] industry means theft by employees at the [[cash register]], by giving away merchandise to a "sweetheart" customer (friend, family, fellow employee).  [[Cashier]]s can do it in numerous ways, including:&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Jeff (Jun 1, 2005 12:00 PM). "[http://multichannelmerchant.com/mag/minding_store/ Minding the Store]", ''MultiChannelMerchant.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scan avoidance
* [[Price override]]s
* Refund fraud, gift card fraud
* Void fraud
* Invoicing scams

Sweethearting is the most common type of employee theft.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, Steven (December 29, 2009). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/business/30theft.html?_r=1 Shoplifters? Studies Say Keep an Eye on Workers]", ''NYTimes.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countermeasures==
Most methods of stopping sweethearting include physical supervision of the cashier or installation of software that detects sweethearting, which can be difficult to do.
Common countermeasures include use of [[CCTV]] surveillance cameras and security guards checking customer receipts at exits. A modern, well-implemented and tightly managed retail management system enables store management to track which cashiers may ring up unusually high amounts of merchandise known to be attractive to thieves.

'''TakarékBank''' is a banking and [[financial services]] corporation in [[Hungary]] and it is the central institution for more than 60 [[Cooperative banking|co-operative banks]] and their 1,100 [[Branch (banking)|branch offices]]. TakarékBank consolidates its co-operative banks and forms the Takarék Group, which is the [[List of banks in Hungary|fourth largest bank]] in [[Hungary]] by [[Assets under management|AUM]] of 1,889 billion Hungarian forint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://bbj.hu/economy/client-savings-in-coop-integration-reach-huf-1889-tln_129351|title= Client savings in coop integration reach HUF 1,889 billion |work=Budapest Business Journal|date= 27 February 2017 |accessdate= 27 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since its inception in 1989, TakarékBank functions both as a central institution and as a corporate and investment bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.takarekbank.hu/takarekbank/hu/egyeb/sajtoszoba/newsCollection/0119/text_files/file/Garanciakozosseg_20141010-EN.pdf|title=16 more cooperative credit institutions have joined the cross-guarantee system|work=TakarékBank|date= 10 October 2014 |accessdate= 10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://bbj.hu/economy/takarekbank-savings-coop-integration-achieved-goals_116988|title= TakarékBank: Savings coop integration achieved goals|work=Budapest Business Journal|date= 1 June 2016 |accessdate= 1 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank headquartered in [[Budapest]], and as a holding, the Takarék Group defines itself primarily as a service provider for the local cooperative banks and their over 1 million clients. TakarékBank is the short form of the Magyar Takarékszövetkezeti Bank Zrt. (literally "Hungarian Central Co-operative Bank"). TakarékBank represents the interests of the Hungarian Cooperative Financial Institutions at both national and international levels and coordinates and develops the joint strategy within the network. The bank advises and supports his members on legal, taxation, and business management issues. TakarékBank is member of the [[EACB]] and the [[Euro Banking Association]]. The bank is also member of the [[Budapest Stock Exchange]].

In late 2016 Takarék Group acquired majority stake in [[FHB Mortgage Bank]], thus begins one of the largest merger in the Hungarian banking industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://en.fhb.hu/fhb-bank/Announcement/Announcement_161209|title=Announcement - VCP sold in OTC transaction 15,970,000 pieces of FHB equity shares to TakarékBank Zrt.|work=FHB Bank|date= 9 December 2016|accessdate= 9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38208">'''Text mining''', also referred to as '''''text data mining''''', roughly equivalent to '''text analytics''', is the process of deriving high-quality [[information]] from [[Plain text|text]]. High-quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends through means such as [[pattern recognition|statistical pattern learning]]. Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a [[database]]), deriving patterns within the [[structured data]], and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]], [[novelty (patent)|novelty]], and interest. Typical text mining tasks include [[text categorization]], [[text clustering]], concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, [[sentiment analysis]], [[document summarization]], and entity relation modeling (''i.e.'', learning relations between [[named entity recognition|named entities]]).

Text analysis involves [[information retrieval]], [[lexical analysis]] to study word frequency distributions, [[pattern recognition]], [[tag (metadata)|tagging]]/[[annotation]], [[information extraction]], [[data mining]] techniques including link and association analysis, [[information visualization|visualization]], and [[predictive analytics]]. The overarching goal is, essentially, to turn text into data for analysis, via application of [[natural language processing]] (NLP) and analytical methods.

A typical application is to scan a set of documents written in a [[natural language]] and either model the document set for [[predictive classification]] purposes or populate a database or search index with the information extracted.

==Text analytics==
The term '''text analytics''' describes a set of [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[statistical]], and [[machine learning]] techniques that model and structure the information content of textual sources for [[business intelligence]], [[exploratory data analysis]], [[research]], or investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/blog/archives/2007/02/defining_text_a.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129171151/http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/blog/archives/2007/02/defining_text_a.html |date=November 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is roughly synonymous with text mining; indeed, [[Ronen Feldman]] modified a 2000 description of "text mining"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dunja/CFPWshKDD2000.html |title=KDD-2000 Workshop on Text Mining - Call for Papers |publisher=Cs.cmu.edu |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 to describe "text analytics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ir.iit.edu/cikm2004/tutorials.html#T2]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303042253/http://www.ir.iit.edu/cikm2004/tutorials.html#T2 |date=March 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter term is now used more frequently in business settings while "text mining" is used in some of the earliest application areas, dating to the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.3115/991813.991833 |title=Proceedings of the 9th conference on Computational linguistics |year=1982 |last1=Hobbs |first1=Jerry R. |last2=Walker |first2=Donald E. |last3=Amsler |first3=Robert A. |volume=1 |pages=127–32|chapter=Natural language access to structured text }}&lt;/ref&gt; notably life-sciences research and government intelligence.

The term text analytics also describes that application of text analytics to respond to business problems, whether independently or in conjunction with query and analysis of fielded, numerical data. It is a truism that 80 percent of business-relevant information originates in unstructured form, primarily text.&lt;ref name="breakthroughanalysis1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://breakthroughanalysis.com/2008/08/01/unstructured-data-and-the-80-percent-rule/ |title=Unstructured Data and the 80 Percent Rule |publisher=Breakthrough Analysis |accessdate=2015-02-23|date=August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques and processes discover and present knowledge – facts, [[business rule]]s, and relationships – that is otherwise locked in textual form, impenetrable to automated processing.

==Text analysis processes==
Subtasks—components of a larger text-analytics effort—typically include:

*[[Information retrieval]] or identification of a [[text corpus|corpus]] is a preparatory step: collecting or identifying a set of textual materials, on the Web or held in a file system, database, or content [[corpus manager]], for analysis.
* Although some text analytics systems apply exclusively advanced statistical methods, many others apply more extensive [[natural language processing]], such as [[part of speech tagging]], syntactic [[parsing]], and other types of linguistic analysis.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
*[[Named entity recognition]] is the use of gazetteers or statistical techniques to identify named text features: people, organizations, place names, stock ticker symbols, certain abbreviations, and so on.
* Disambiguation—the use of contextual clues—may be required to decide where, for instance, "Ford" can refer to a former U.S. president, a vehicle manufacturer, a movie star, a river crossing, or some other entity.
* Recognition of Pattern Identified Entities: Features such as telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, quantities (with units) can be discerned via regular expression or other pattern matches.
*Document clustering: identification of sets of similar text documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Wui Lee|last2=Tay|first2=Kai Meng|last3=Lim|first3=Chee Peng|date=2017-02-06|title=A New Evolving Tree-Based Model with Local Re-learning for Document Clustering and Visualization|journal=Neural Processing Letters|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=379–409|doi=10.1007/s11063-017-9597-3|issn=1370-4621}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Coreference]]: identification of [[noun phrase]]s and other terms that refer to the same object.
* Relationship, fact, and event Extraction: identification of associations among entities and other information in text
*[[Sentiment analysis]] involves discerning subjective (as opposed to factual) material and extracting various forms of attitudinal information: sentiment, opinion, mood, and emotion. Text analytics techniques are helpful in analyzing, sentiment at the entity, concept, or topic level and in distinguishing opinion holder and opinion object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://breakthroughanalysis.com/2010/06/14/2514/ |title=Full Circle Sentiment Analysis |publisher=Breakthrough Analysis |accessdate=2015-02-23|date=2010-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Quantitative text analysis is a set of techniques stemming from the social sciences where either a human judge or a computer extracts semantic or grammatical relationships between words in order to find out the meaning or stylistic patterns of, usually, a casual personal text for the purpose of [[psychological profiling]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1037/11383-011 |title=Handbook of multimethod measurement in psychology |year=2006 |last1=Mehl |first1=Matthias R. |isbn=978-1-59147-318-3 |page=141|chapter=Quantitative Text Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Text mining technology is now broadly applied to a wide variety of government, research, and business needs. All three groups may use text mining for records management and searching documents relevant to their daily activities. Legal professionals may use text mining for [[e-discovery]]. Governments and military groups use text mining for [[national security]] and intelligence purposes. Scientific researchers incorporate text mining approaches into efforts to organize large sets of text data (i.e., addressing the problem of [[unstructured data]]), to determine ideas communicated through text (e.g., [[sentiment analysis]] in [[social media]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pang|first=Bo|last2=Lee|first2=Lillian|date=2008|title=Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis|journal=Foundations and Trends® in Information Retrieval|volume=2|issue=1–2|pages=1–135|doi=10.1561/1500000011|issn=1554-0669|citeseerx=10.1.1.147.2755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paltoglou|first=Georgios|last2=Thelwall|first2=Mike|date=2012-09-01|title=Twitter, MySpace, Digg: Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis in Social Media|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2337542.2337551|journal=ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST)|volume=3|issue=4|pages=66|doi=10.1145/2337542.2337551|issn=2157-6904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task4/|title=Sentiment Analysis in Twitter &lt; SemEval-2017 Task 4|website=alt.qcri.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and to support [[scientific discovery]] in fields such as the [[life sciences]] and [[bioinformatics]]. In business, applications are used to support [[competitive intelligence]] and automated [[ad serving|ad placement]], among numerous other activities.

===Security applications===
Many text mining software packages are marketed for [[security appliance|security applications]], especially monitoring and analysis of online plain text sources such as [[Internet news]], [[blog]]s, etc. for [[national security]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-88181-0_7 |title=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Security for Information Systems CISIS'08 |series=Advances in Soft Computing |year=2009 |last1=Zanasi |first1=Alessandro |isbn=978-3-540-88180-3 |volume=53 |page=53|chapter=Virtual Weapons for Real Wars: Text Mining for National Security }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also involved in the study of text [[encryption]]/[[decryption]].

===Software applications===
Text mining methods and software is also being researched and developed by major firms, including [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]], to further automate the mining and analysis processes, and by different firms working in the area of search and indexing in general as a way to improve their results.
Within public sector much effort has been concentrated on creating software for tracking and monitoring [[Information Awareness Office|terrorist activities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/texor-a-chat-mining-program.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224652/http://yatsko.zohosites.com/texor-a-chat-mining-program.html |date=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online media applications===
Text mining is being used by large media companies, such as the [[Tribune Company]], to clarify information and to provide readers with greater search experiences, which in turn increases site "stickiness" and revenue. Additionally, on the back end, editors are benefiting by being able to share, associate and package news across properties, significantly increasing opportunities to monetize content.

===Business and marketing applications===
Text mining is starting to be used in marketing as well, more specifically in analytical [[customer relationship management]].&lt;ref name="Text Analytics: The “Why” Behind the Score"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medallia.com/text-analytics/ |title=Text Analytics |publisher=Medallia |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coussement and Van den Poel (2008)&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005 |url=http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:rug:rugwps:08/502 |title=Integrating the voice of customers through call center emails into a decision support system for churn prediction |year=2008 |last1=Coussement |first1=Kristof |last2=Van Den Poel |first2=Dirk |journal=Information &amp; Management |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=164–74|citeseerx=10.1.1.113.3238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.dss.2007.10.010 |url=http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:rug:rugwps:07/481 |title=Improving customer complaint management by automatic email classification using linguistic style features as predictors |year=2008 |last1=Coussement |first1=Kristof |last2=Van Den Poel |first2=Dirk |journal=Decision Support Systems |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=870–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; apply it to improve [[predictive analytics]] models for customer churn ([[customer attrition]]).&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005" /&gt; Text mining is also being applied in stock returns prediction.&lt;ref name="Galvez2017"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877750317300091 | title=Assessing the usefulness of online message board mining in automatic stock prediction systems |author1=Ramiro H.

===Sentiment analysis===
[[Sentiment analysis]] may involve analysis of movie reviews for estimating how favorable a review is for a movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.3115/1118693.1118704 |title=Proceedings of the ACL-02 conference on Empirical methods in natural language processing |year=2002 |last1=Pang |first1=Bo |last2=Lee |first2=Lillian |last3=Vaithyanathan |first3=Shivakumar |volume=10 |pages=79–86|chapter=Thumbs up? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

Text has been used to detect emotions in the related area of affective computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/T-AFFC.2010.1 |title=Affect Detection: An Interdisciplinary Review of Models, Methods, and Their Applications |year=2010 |last1=Calvo |first1=Rafael A |last2=d'Mello |first2=Sidney |journal=IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=18–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text based approaches to affective computing have been used on multiple corpora such as students evaluations, children stories and news stories.

===Scientific literature mining and academic applications===

The issue of text mining is of importance to publishers who hold large [[database]]s of information needing [[index (database)|indexing]] for retrieval. This is especially true in scientific disciplines, in which highly specific information is often contained within written text. Therefore, initiatives have been taken such as [[Nature (journal)|Nature's]] proposal for an Open Text Mining Interface (OTMI) and the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s common Journal Publishing [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) that would provide semantic cues to machines to answer specific queries contained within text without removing publisher barriers to public access.

Academic institutions have also become involved in the text mining initiative:

* The [[National Centre for Text Mining]] (NaCTeM), is the first publicly funded text mining centre in the world. NaCTeM is operated by the [[University of Manchester]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk |title=The University of Manchester |publisher=Manchester.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in close collaboration with the Tsujii Lab,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html |title=Tsujii Laboratory |publisher=Tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html |title=The University of Tokyo |publisher=UTokyo |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; NaCTeM provides customised tools, research facilities and offers advice to the academic community. They are funded by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] (JISC) and two of the UK [[Research Council]]s ([[EPSRC]] &amp; [[BBSRC]]). With an initial focus on text mining in the [[biology|biological]] and [[biomedical]] sciences, research has since expanded into the areas of [[social sciences]].
* In the United States, the [[UC Berkeley School of Information|School of Information]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]] is developing a program called BioText to assist [[biology]] researchers in text mining and analysis.
* The [[Text Analysis Portal for Research]] (TAPoR), currently housed at the [[University of Alberta]], is a scholarly project to catalogue text analysis applications and create a gateway for researchers new to the practice.

==== Methods for scientific literature mining ====
Computational methods have been developed to assist with information retrieval from scientific literature. Published approaches include methods for searching,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shen|first=Jiaming|last2=Xiao|first2=Jinfeng|last3=He|first3=Xinwei|last4=Shang|first4=Jingbo|last5=Sinha|first5=Saurabh|last6=Han|first6=Jiawei|date=2018-06-27|title=Entity Set Search of Scientific Literature: An Unsupervised Ranking Approach|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3209978.3210055|publisher=ACM|pages=565–574|doi=10.1145/3209978.3210055|isbn=9781450356572}}&lt;/ref&gt; determining novelty&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=Lothar|last2=Radauer|first2=Alfred|last3=Moehrle|first3=Martin G.|date=2017-02-06|title=The beauty of brimstone butterfly: novelty of patents identified by near environment analysis based on text mining|journal=Scientometrics|language=en|volume=111|issue=1|pages=103–115|doi=10.1007/s11192-017-2267-4|issn=0138-9130}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and clarifying [[Homonym|homonyms]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roll|first=Uri|last2=Correia|first2=Ricardo A.|last3=Berger-Tal|first3=Oded|date=2018-03-10|title=Using machine learning to disentangle homonyms in large text corpora|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=32|issue=3|pages=716–724|doi=10.1111/cobi.13044|pmid=29086438|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt; among technical reports.

=== Digital humanities and computational sociology ===
The automatic analysis of vast textual corpora has created the possibility for scholars to analyze
millions of documents in multiple languages with very limited manual intervention. Key enabling technologies have been parsing, machine translation, topic categorization, and machine learning.

[[File:Tripletsnew2012.png|thumb|right|Narrative network of US Elections 2012&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Automated analysis of the US presidential elections using Big Data and network analysis; S Sudhahar, GA Veltri, N Cristianini; Big Data &amp; Society 2 (1), 1-28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, turning textual data into network data.  The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analyzed by using tools from network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Network analysis of narrative content in large corpora; S Sudhahar, G De Fazio, R Franzosi, N Cristianini; Natural Language Engineering, 1-32, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This automates the approach introduced by quantitative narrative analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Quantitative Narrative Analysis; Roberto Franzosi; Emory University © 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

[[Content analysis]] has been a traditional part of social sciences and media studies for a long time. The automation of content analysis has allowed a "[[big data]]" revolution to take place in that field, with studies in social media and newspaper content that include millions of news items. [[Gender bias]], [[readability]], content similarity, reader preferences, and even mood have been analyzed based on text mining methods over millions of documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lansdall-Welfare|first=Thomas|last2=Sudhahar|first2=Saatviga|last3=Thompson|first3=James|last4=Lewis|first4=Justin|last5=Team|first5=FindMyPast Newspaper|last6=Cristianini|first6=Nello|date=2017-01-09|title=Content analysis of 150 years of British periodicals|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/03/1606380114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=114|issue=4|language=en|pages=E457–E465|doi=10.1073/pnas.1606380114|issn=0027-8424|pmid=28069962|pmc=5278459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.

===Situation in Europe===
[[File:FixCopyright- Copyright &amp; Research - Text &amp; Data Mining (TDM) Explained.webm|thumb|Video by Fix Copyright campaign explaining TDM and its copyright issues in the EU, 2016 [3:52]]Because of a lack of flexibilities in European copyright and [[Database Directive|database law]], the mining of in-copyright works (such as [[web mining]]) without the permission of the copyright owner is illegal.  In the UK in 2014, on the recommendation of the [[Hargreaves review]] the government amended copyright law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/june/researchers-given-data-mining-right-under-new-uk-copyright-laws/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609020315/http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/june/researchers-given-data-mining-right-under-new-uk-copyright-laws/ |date=June 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow text mining as a [[Limitations and exceptions to copyright|limitation and exception]]. It was only the second country in the world to do so, following [[Copyright law of Japan|Japan]], which introduced a mining-specific exception in 2009. However, owing to the restriction of the [[Copyright Directive]], the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions.

The [[European Commission]] facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and [[data mining]] in 2013, under the title of Licenses for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licences for Europe - Structured Stakeholder Dialogue 2013|url=http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/en/content/about-site|website=European Commission|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the focus on the solution to this legal issue was licenses, and not limitations and exceptions to copyright law, led representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and [[open access]] publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text and Data Mining:Its importance and the need for change in Europe|url=http://libereurope.eu/news/text-and-data-mining-its-importance-and-the-need-for-change-in-europe/|website=[[Association of European Research Libraries]]|accessdate=14 November 2014|date=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation in the United States===
By contrast to Europe, the flexible nature of US copyright law, and in particular [[fair use]], means that text mining in America, as well as other fair use countries such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea, is viewed as being legal. As text mining is transformative, meaning that it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the [[Google Book Search Settlement Agreement|Google Book settlement]] the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed—one such use being text and data mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge grants summary judgment in favor of Google Books — a fair use victory|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a18c5b92-5a20-4d1d-a098-a3095046a88e|website=Lexology.com|publisher=Antonelli Law Ltd|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
Until recently, websites most often used text-based searches, which only found documents containing specific user-defined words or phrases. Now, through use of a [[semantic web]], text mining can find content based on meaning and context (rather than just by a specific word). Additionally, text mining software can be used to build large dossiers of information about specific people and events.  For example, large datasets based on data extracted from news reports can be built to facilitate social networks analysis or [[counter-intelligence]].  In effect, the text mining software may act in a capacity similar to an [[intelligence analyst]] or research librarian, albeit with a more limited scope of analysis. Text mining is also used in some email [[spam filter]]s as a way of determining the characteristics of messages that are likely to be advertisements or other unwanted material. Text mining plays an important role in determining financial [[market sentiment]].

==Future==
Increasing interest is being paid to multilingual data mining: the ability to gain information across languages and cluster similar items from different linguistic sources according to their meaning. Popular text analytics tools includes [[Accern]], [[Lexalytics]], and Repustate. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.efinancialcareers.com/ch-en/285462/the-top-big-data-companies-to-work-for-by-j-p-morgan|title=43 of the top big data companies to work for, by J.P. Morgan|date=2017-06-01|work=eFinancialCareers|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-CH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenge of exploiting the large proportion of enterprise information that originates in "unstructured" form has been recognized for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/6311|title=A Brief History of Text Analytics by Seth Grimes|date=2007-10-30|publisher=Beyenetwork|accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recognized in the earliest definition of [[business intelligence]] (BI), in an October 1958 IBM Journal article by H.P. Luhn, A Business Intelligence System, which describes a system that will:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...utilize data-processing machines for auto-abstracting and auto-encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles for each of the 'action points' in an organization. Both incoming and internally generated documents are automatically abstracted, characterized by a word pattern, and sent automatically to appropriate action points."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet as management information systems developed starting in the 1960s, and as BI emerged in the '80s and '90s as a software category and field of practice, the emphasis was on numerical data stored in relational databases. This is not surprising: text in "unstructured" documents is hard to process. The emergence of text analytics in its current form stems from a refocusing of research in the late 1990s from algorithm development to application, as described by Prof. Marti A. Hearst in the paper Untangling Text Data Mining:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the 37th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Computational Linguistics|last1=Hearst|first1=Marti A.|year=1999|isbn=978-1-55860-609-8|pages=3–10|chapter=Untangling text data mining|doi=10.3115/1034678.1034679|chapter-url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/papers/acl99/acl99-tdm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For almost a decade the computational linguistics community has viewed large text collections as a resource to be tapped in order to produce better text analysis algorithms. In this paper, I have attempted to suggest a new emphasis: the use of large online text collections to discover new facts and trends about the world itself. I suggest that to make progress we do not need fully artificial intelligent text analysis; rather, a mixture of computationally-driven and user-guided analysis may open the door to exciting new results.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hearst's 1999 statement of need fairly well describes the state of text analytics technology and practice a decade later.

The '''Turkish Confederation of Businessmen and Industrialists''' ({{lang-tr|'''Türkiye İşadamları ve Sanayiciler Konfederasyonu'''}}), best known by the abbreviation '''TUSKON''', was a [[employers' organization]] in [[Turkey]], with about 40,000 members. It was founded in 2005 by seven business federations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Christopher Holton|author2=Clare Lopez|title=The Gulen Movement|url=https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Gulen_Final.pdf|work=Center for Security Policy|accessdate=2 August 2016|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety percent of the TUSKON members were small or medium establishments with fewer than 50 employees.

==Overview==

'''Whitfield''' is an ancient village, [[civil parish]] and [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] in the English county of [[Kent]]. It has a modern counterpart in the large settlement located at the junction of the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] and [[A256 road]]s, some four miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Dover]].

The village itself ([[Church Whitfield]]) can claim ancient roots in that evidence of both [[Roman Britain|Roman]] and [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] settlements have been unearthed. The village church, dedicated to [[St Peter]], has two Saxon windows, and the bell is from the 13th century, or earlier. St. Peter's Church is a 10th Century Saxon Church largely rebuilt in Norman times, though the church is first mentioned in 762 AD. It was [[Victorian restoration|restored]] and enlarged in 1894.

There is also an early Congregational Chapel in the village (Chapel Rd) dating to 1781 but rebuilt in 1867. Whitfield also had its own windmill for many years, with a bakery beneath. It was built in about 1755 and was owned by generations of the Cadman family. In 1900 the mill was left to decay and was finally demolished in 1916 though the mill house still stands in Napchester Road.

The modern Whitfield began to appear when the more affluent citizens of Dover built their homes in "West Whitfeld", alongside what was to become the A2 trunk road which [[bypass (road)|bypass]]ed the village.&lt;ref&gt;"The Kent Village Book" Alan Bignell 1999 {{ISBN|1-85306-571-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern (post-Second World War) development enlarged the new village and in the 1960s Beauxfield was built then extended in the 1980s.

The 1970s saw with the introduction of Newlands, Cranleigh Drive and Farncombe Way. Again in 2005, the government proposed a maximum of 9,900 new homes to be built on [[greenfield site]]s around the village, doubling its size. The ''Whitfield Action Group'' was set up to oppose any large scale developments while accepting natural growth. It was confirmed in February 2010, that this figure will now be 6,000 new homes built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitfieldactiongroup.co.uk/Whitfield Village Action Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main village of Whitfield along the 'Sandwich Road' has, as amenities, a [[public house]], 'The Archer'; the private members/function hall 'The Whitfield Club'&lt;ref&gt;[http://dover-kent.com/Whitfield-Club-Whitfield.html Clubs of Whitfield&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Rolles Court Guest House and the Ramada Dover Hotel (formerly the Dover Motel). There is also a village hall with doctors surgery, vets, café, take aways, hairdresser and the local Post Office. A branch of [[McDonald's]] and [[Esso]] service station is located near the A2 roundabout at the top of ''''Whitfield''' Hill'. The village's older pub, the Royal Oak, closed in February 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dover-kent.com/Royal-Oak-Whitfield.html ROYAL OAK (Whitfield) Pubs of Dover]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Marston's Brewery]] pub/restaurant, the 'Kittiwake', is now open at the junction of Menzies Road/Gordon Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dover-kent.com/Kittiwake-Whitfield.html Pubs of Whitfield&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; July 2015 saw the introduction of new [[KFC]], [[Pets at Home]] and [[B &amp; M]] stores on the ever-expanding Honeywood Retail Park, Honeywood Parkway.

The village has two schools, both of which also cater for special educational needs: primary and secondary. Whitfield and Aspen School (primary);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitfield.kent.sch.uk/ Whitfield and Aspen School]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dover Christ Church Academy, formerly Archers Court School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dccacademy.org.uk/ Dover Christ Church Academy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of its site on the periphery of a town such as Dover, and because of its strategic position on the A2/A256 junction, Whitfield is of importance to businesses. The huge White Cliffs Business Park,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dover.gov.uk/business/future_developments-flag.asp White Cliffs Business Park]&lt;/ref&gt; covering 272&amp;nbsp;acres (110&amp;nbsp;ha) is located at Whitfield and is described as attracting "… household names and a raft of companies with international pedigrees".

==Origins and Growth==

The village of Whitfield has grown so that it is now physically connected to urban Dover, Kent, yet it has kept its own identity and sense of place. The central core of modern Whitfield was, however, not the original heart of the village; the original settlement was sited at Church Whitfield to the east. Pineham, located to the east of Church Whitfield is a small rural hamlet that is often considered part of the Whitfield community. It contains a small handful of farms and houses.

Church Whitfield seems to have originated around a small, enclosed farmstead; archaeological work in the area showed that there was a collection of structures on the site during the early medieval period and evidence of both Roman and Saxon settlements. The Roman road from Dover (Dubris) to Richborough (Rutupiae) runs north-south near Pineham, suggesting that the village developed along its route.  The village church, dedicated to St Peter, is testament to this history; the church is a 10th Century Saxon structure largely rebuilt in Norman times, though the church is first mentioned in 762 AD. The building has two Saxon windows, and the bell dates from the 13th century.  The village was originally known as 'Bewsfield', which is said to refer to its high and open situation. It is thought that Whitfield began to be called 'Whytefeld' in the mid-seventeenth century.

At some point in the later medieval period, a new village was formed to the west. This may have been due to the Black Death, whereby many villages moved their centre of habitation a mile or two for fear of being too near the burial site of victims. The 'new' village became known as West Whitfield, before changing to Lower Whitfield and simply as 'Whitfield' as the village gradually grew. Old Whitfield to the northeast then became known as Church Whitfield. The villages developed quite different characters but maintained a close attachment in terms of physical proximity. Early maps such as the Andrews and Drury map of 1769, shows the basic arrangement of the villages, as separate, but linked hamlets.

Map research shows the small scale, village origins of Whitfield, before twentieth century expansion. The village was based around a roughly triangular road pattern, comprising Forge Lane/Lenacre Lane, Church Lane (now Napchester Road and Nursery Lane), and what is known today as The Drove. To the west, development was centred on Lenacre Court, although the original Lenacre Manor may originally have been located further south; a 'Lennickers' is shown on early nineteenth century maps, on roughly the location of Bewsbury Cross Farm. This development led along forge lane to the north, around Whitfield house, and towards the Congregational Chapel, originally built in 1781. To the east, development was clustered around the Windmill with a bakery beneath, originally built in 1755. The example at Whitfield was a smock mill, consisting of an octagonal, weather boarded tower, on a brick or masonry base. However, windmills suffered a rapid decline during the early twentieth century due to an influx of cheap imported grain and new government food regulations. Whitfield mill was demolished in 1916 after standing derelict for many years. This was originally a key focus to the village.

The village was linked to Church Whitfield and Pineham via Shepherds Cross to the north, and through a series of lanes and footpaths across the fields. It is clear that Whitfield was originally very rural in character with a tight knit collection of lanes in the oldest section of the village to the north of Nursery Lane. Map research shows however, that Whitfield was bisected in the early nineteenth century by the main Sandwich Road. The Mudge map of 1801 shows that a small lane or footpath had been built linking church lane to the crossroads at the top of forge lane. However, by the production of the first small scale ordnance survey maps in 1816, a main route running directly through the village from north to south had been constructed. This altered the village in a drastic manner, literally cutting the settlement in half – the reasoning behind the chosen route is unclear. The Royal Oak Public house dates from this time, built as a coaching stop along this main route to the improving harbour at Sandwich.

The modern Whitfield developed when more affluent citizens of Dover began to build new homes, alongside the junction of the A2 and A256 roads near the village. Gradually, the historic built form has been subsumed into the modern housing with no clear distinction created between the older segments of the village, and the modern growth. This has diluted the architectural character of Whitfield. As a result, Whitfield is now largely suburban in character, with remnants of the older village scattered throughout. There are a few elements within Whitfield that give some indication of the original character of the village, within the network of small lanes. Post housing dates from the post-war period. Where historic buildings survive, they show a strong tradition of brick and flint. In contrast, church Whitfield has retained a very rural character with a small cluster of houses and farms built around the church. The houses have however, been altered in form and are now mainly rendered and modernised. Post war development enlarged the village and in the 1960s new estates such as Beauxfield were built and extended in the 1980s. The Newlands, Cranleigh Drive and Farncombe Way were built in the 1970s.
