The '''Adam Mickiewicz monument in Gorzów Wielkopolski''' is a notable [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]] statue, located near a cross of [[Lwów Eaglets]] Street and [[Władysław Sikorski]] Street. The monument was designed by [[Józef Gosławski (Polish sculptor)|Józef Gosławski]]. The statue was unveiled 15 December 1957 to commemorate an anniversary of poet's death. The cast was produced by the ''Mechanical Plants "Gorzów"'' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Zakłady Mechaniczne "Gorzów"''). Funds for monument came from contributions of local society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ziemialubuska.pl/1930,1881,,.html|title=Gorzów Wlkp. - Wojcieszyce|last1=|first1=|date=|publisher=ziemialubuska.pl|language=pl|accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original version [[Adam Mickiewicz]] held a feather in his left and a book in his right hand, but during the work a committee changed an idea and as a result one hand of the poet is 20&amp;nbsp;cm longer than the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gorzow.gazeta.pl/gorzow/1,78945,5971869,Pomnikowa_anarchia__czyli_od_Micka_do_Marszalka.html|title=Pomnikowa anarchia, czyli od Micka do Marszałka|last1=Barański|first1=Dariusz|date=2008-11-20|publisher=gorzow.gazeta.pl|language=pl|accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arab Writers Union''' (ar.: اتحاد الكتاب العرب) is an association of Arab writers, founded in 1969, in Damascus, at the initiative of a group of writers among whom the Syrian novelist [[Hanna Mina]].
 
==The actual location==

The Union is currently based, from 2015, in [[Abu Dhabi]], after it was moved from Damascus to [[Cairo]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khallaf|first1=Rania|title=Everything is under control|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/893/cu2.htm|accessdate=23 February 2011|work=Al-Ahram Weekly|issue=893|publisher=Al-Ahram Publishing House|date=17 April 2008|ref=al-ahram weekly|archiveurl=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/Archive/2008/893/cu2.htm|archivedate=18 March 2016|location=Cairo, Egypt|language=English|format=Online magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adunis and the Union==

On 27 January 1995, following Syrian pressure, it was announced in [[Damascus]] that the Arab Writers Union had expelled the Syrian poet [[Adunis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Youssef M.|last=Ibrahim|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/world/arabs-split-on-cultural-ties-to-israel.html|title=Arabs Split on Cultural Ties to Israel|work=The New York Times|date=7 March 1995|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Austar''' was an Australian telecommunications company. Its main business activity was [[pay television|subscription television]] but it has also been involved with [[internet access]] and mobile phones. It was founded in 1995 under the name Community Entertainment Television (CETV).&lt;ref name=paytvgoesbush&gt;{{cite news | newspaper =  [[The Australian]]  | title =  Pay TV Goes Bush| first = Deborah | last = Brewster | section =  | page = 40  | date = 3 November 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper =  [[Daily Telegraph]]  | title =  Pay-TV – a new Austar is born.| first = Kathy | last = Lipari | section =  | page = 23  | location = Sydney | date = 10 September 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austar's television subscriber base grew to 747,148 (at 30 June 2010), making it the largest subscription television operator in regional and rural Australia.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Austar provided [[subscription television]] services in a service area of approximately 2.4m homes, one-third of Australia's total homes, primarily using [[digital satellite technology]].  Austar also operated a digital cable network in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]].

Austar is now owned by [[Foxtel]], which acquired the company in 2012. Since the acquisition, Foxtel has progressively merged all operations into a national system. In mid-to-late 2013, Foxtel merged all accounts to Foxtel and removed the MyStar related online services. This was the last step in the merge. In November 2013, the Foxtel iQ units were made available with satellite connections for those who wished to replace their MyStar units. The transition was completed in 2014, when all Austar branding was replaced with the current Foxtel moniker. Austar was involved with providing services to [[Sega Channel]] in Australia in partnership with [[Namco Bandai Partners]], a joint venture between [[Sega]] and Ozisoft.

==Foxtel takeover==
On 11 July 2011, Austar announced that "it had entered into definitive transaction agreements with [[Liberty Global]], Inc. (LGI) and Foxtel Management Pty Limited (Foxtel) under which Foxtel will acquire AUSTAR by a series of transactions including a scheme of arrangement (Scheme)."&lt;ref name="Foxtel Takeover"&gt;

Austar's main business was subscription television, serving customers outside of the major metro areas. It took programming from both Foxtel and [[Optus]] services, and operates on a digital platform.

Austar Television was available in 2.4&amp;nbsp;million homes in regional areas of [[New South Wales]], Victoria, [[Queensland]] and South Australia and all areas of [[Tasmania]] and the [[Northern Territory]]. Subscriber numbers to Austar Television were second behind [[Foxtel]]. Delivery methods include utilising the Optus C-Class Satellite [[Optus C1]] and a digital cable network in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]].

===On Demand (Featured) ===

Austar Featured on Demand used to deliver Austar shows – on demand – to the MyStar each week free of charge with a MyStar subscription. It has since been replaced by Foxtel on Demand.

===Austar AnyWhere===

Austar AnyWhere was Austar's online TV service, which allowed customers to watch or download full-length programs online. Austar Anywhere closed on 30 June 2013.

[[File:Austar MyStar Front.jpg|thumb|400px|right|MyStar PVR]]

===The ''MyStar'' personal digital recorder===
MyStar was launched to existing subscribers in late 2007, with a general launch to both new and existing customers in February 2008.&lt;ref name="mystarlaunch"&gt;[http://www.austarunited.com.au/press_view.asp?id=330 Austar United Press Release – MyStar revolutionises regional Australian TV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719063925/http://www.austarunited.com.au/press_view.asp?id=330 |date=19 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last MyStar was the model T500. It was a four-tuner [[set-top box]] equipped with two satellite tuners and two terrestrial tuners available both for viewing and recording standard definition digital [[free-to-air]] services including full [[electronic program guide]] data for [[Seven Network]], [[WIN Television]], [[Prime Television]] and [[Network Ten]]. ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] and [[ABC2]] continue to be provided via satellite). However, only two tuners can be used because the processor is not capable of handling all four tuners at once.

It featureed a 160&amp;nbsp;GB [[hard drive]], with 120&amp;nbsp;GB user accessible. It could record 60 hours of content. Because it is equipped with [[Macrovision]] [[copy protection]], content saved to the MyStar cannot be transferred to other media (such as VHS or DVD) without the use of something such as a video stabiliser. It had support for [[Time shifting]] for up to one hour.&lt;ref name="mystarusermanual"&gt;[http://www.austar.com.au/mystar/mystar_um.zip] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913012503/http://www.austar.com.au/mystar/mystar_um.zip |date=13 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for [[Dolby Digital]] Surround Sound was available on selected programming when connected to appropriate equipment, however the Mystar box wouldn't control the volume when using optical or coax, the volume had to be controlled by the device it was plugged into. It also had support for [[Closed Captioning]] and four different aspect ratios (4:3 Cropped, 16:9 Letterbox, 16:9 Postcard and 16:9 Widescreen). Both of these features were accessible through the remote's coloured buttons.&lt;ref name="mystarusermanual" /&gt;

It supported additional outputs not found on some of the standard decoders such as [[Component Video]], as well as both [[coaxial]] and [[Optical fiber cable|optical]] digital audio outputs. Support for [[Composite Video]], [[S-Video]] and [[Radio frequency|RF]] out were also available. It also had [[USB]] and [[Ethernet]] ports, but they didn't have a clear function as yet, and were likely to be used for updating the decoder.&lt;ref name="mystarusermanual" /&gt;

The MyStar Remote is similar to the standard Austar Digital remote, but it had the addition of buttons specific to recording and playing back video. It shared an almost identical design to the [[Foxtel IQ#Foxtel iQ (current model)|Foxtel IQ]] remote, with the exception that it has an Austar button instead of a Foxtel button, and there were no AV button.

[[File:Mystar remote.JPG|thumb|Austar MyStar Remote Control (Manufactured by Philips)]]

The next generation of MyStar, called MyStar HD, was launched on 15 November 2009, with installations beginning the following day. It had many advantages over its predecessor, most notably support for 1080i, HD programming. It included a 320&amp;nbsp;GB hard disk, a doubling over the 160&amp;nbsp;GB found in the original MyStar. Only 160&amp;nbsp;GB of this was available for recordings and other user-selected content, with the other 160&amp;nbsp;GB being reserved for OnDemand content, which launched in early 2010. MyStar HD also included an HDMI output, allowing HD content to be viewed in its native resolution. It had a model number of T600 and also a T601.

Austar planned to use MyStar HD as its cornerstone set-top box, with true video-on-demand launched in 2010, and more access to web content becoming available after that time, building up to a complete interface redesign for its set-top boxes in late 2011 or early 2012. Since the Foxtel acquisition, these plans have changed. The plan was originally to upgrade MyStar and phase it out in 2014, however in 2013 Foxtel decided to convert their IQHD units to satellite connections and made them available to "Austar" customers in November 2013. Foxtel had no plans to force current MyStar subscribers to replace their unit, if they don't wish, however they are offering upgrades to customers who wish to take advantage before the IQ3 launch in 2015.

===Mystar criticism===
MyStar had ongoing technical issues which have plagued the system since release; however, Austar have said that "they have a huge team of people that will actively jump onto any issues as soon as they are reported to the call centre".

Established in 2000, Austar Mobile offered mobile services via resale agreements with Optus [GSM] mobile network. After the closure of Telstra's CDMA network, Austar mobile would only offer services through Optus. Austarmobile, at 31 December 2009, had 19,970 customers.

On 23 February 2011, M2 bought the contracts and records for its mobile service from Austar for $2 million.

==Dial-up internet (Austarnet)==
Established in 2000, Austarnet outsourced its network to [[COMindico]] and was available across Australia.

At 31 December 2009, Austarnet had 12,671 customers.

In August 2011, Austarnet announced its exit from the Internet business and indicated that services would be discontinued on 30 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austar.com.au/tv/support/austarnet-closure.aspx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031203225/http://www.austar.com.au/tv/support/austarnet-closure.aspx |date=31 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadband internet (Austar Broadband)==
Established in 2006, Austar Broadband operated as a trial network in [[Wagga Wagga]]&lt;ref&gt;Austar United Press Release: http://www.austarunited.com.au/pdf/06-06-08%20AUSTAR%20Broadband%20launch%20release%20-%20final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Tamworth, New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Austar United Press Release: http://www.austarunited.com.au/pdf/06-11-28%20AUSTAR%20broadband%20arrives%20in%20Tamworth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Austar held the 2.5 &amp; 3.5&amp;nbsp;GHz spectrum licences in regional Australia. This spectrum is ideally suited for [[WiMAX]].

===Austar/Unwired Alliance===
In 2005, Austar United and wireless internet provider [[Unwired]] announced a deal to swap spectrum under either company's control to allow for interoperable wireless broadband services across the country.   In 2006, Austar United and Unwired together with [[TPG Telecom|Soul Coverged Telecommunications]] formed AUSalliance for the purposes of obtaining funding from the Australian Government's Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program and rolling out a regional broadband network.&lt;ref&gt;Austar United Press Release: http://www.austarunited.com.au/pdf/06-03-29%20AUSTAR%20_%20Soul%20partner%20for%20regional%20b'dband%20network.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austar/Opel agreement===
In 2008, Austar entered into an agreement to sell its 2.5 &amp; 3.5&amp;nbsp;GHz spectrum licences to the OPEL consortium (Optus &amp; Elders) for A$65&amp;nbsp;million and enter into a wholesale agreement with Optus for the resale of products operated by the OPEL consortium.&lt;ref name="opelsale"&gt;[http://www.austarunited.com.au/pdf/08-01-07%20%20AUSTAR%20spectrum%20FINAL%20website.pdf Austar United Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719064013/http://www.austarunited.com.au/pdf/08-01-07%20%20AUSTAR%20spectrum%20FINAL%20website.pdf |date=19 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was contingent on the OPEL network rollout, so was cancelled upon the cancellation of the OPEL network by the Australian Government.

The '''Minsk Blitz''' was the heavy bombing of the city of [[Minsk]] (population was 270,000) in the [[USSR]] during the [[Second World War]].

During 24 June 1941 three waves of bombers, of 47 aircraft each, bombed Minsk. The anti-aircraft defense of the city was poorly organized, and panic ensued. Because the water supply was destroyed, fires could not be put down, and the city was evacuated.

As much as 85% of the city's buildings and the entire infrastructure was destroyed. More than 1,000 people were killed.

'''"Bye Bye I Love You"''' was the [[Luxembourg]]ish entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974]], performed (despite the [[English language|English]] of the title, although the title phrase is in that language) in [[French language|French]] by German-British singer [[Ireen Sheer]]. The song is notable in the history of the Contest; it was the very first entry composed by Eurovision veteran [[Ralph Siegel]], who would go on write 19 ESC entries throughout the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s - 14 for [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest|Germany]] including 1982 winner "[[Ein bißchen Frieden]]", 3 for Luxembourg, 1 for [[Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Switzerland]], Montenegro in 2009, [[The Social Network Song]] for San Marino in 2012 and most recently "[[Crisalide (Vola)]]" for San Marino in 2013.

"Bye, Bye, I Love You" is a mid-tempo ballad in which Sheer sings about ending a relationship with a man she appears to have met on a holiday. She sings that "I didn't really speak French" and that "you can't say a word in English", but despite the [[language barrier]], the two were able to enjoy a happy relationship for some time. Her lover, however, was not entirely faithful - thus, regardless of her feelings, she ends the relationship. Sheer recorded the song in three languages, French, English and German - all with the title "Bye Bye I Love You".

The song was performed ninth on the night (following [[Sweden]]'s [[ABBA]] with "[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]" and preceding [[Monaco]]'s [[Romuald Figuier|Romuald]] with "[[Celui qui reste et celui qui s'en va]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 14 points, placing 4th in a field of 17.

It was succeeded as [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourgish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975 Contest]] by [[Geraldine Branagan|Géraldine]] with "[[Toi (song)|Toi]]". Ireen Sheer returned to the Contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] with "[[Feuer (song)|Feuer]]", then representing Germany, and again in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985]] competing for Luxembourg with "[[Children, Kinder, Enfants]]", both songs Ralph Siegel/[[Bernd Meinunger]] compositions.

The documentary depicts an ephemeral town made up by men, women and children who all arrived with the same goal: To find gold and make it rich. The Diosso Hill, in [[Burkina Faso]], was transformed by the presence of thousands of people, often without their families knowing that they were even there. [[Prospecting|Prospectors]], dynamite blasters, retailers, prostitutes, healers, etc., all risk their lives daily, fight against themselves and amongst themselves and, finally, seem unable to leave this place set apart from time.

'''Chupryna''' ({{lang-ua|чуприна}}), '''chub''' (Ukrainian: чуб, "[[Crest (feathers)|crest]]"), '''khokhol''' (Russian: хохол, "[[forelock]]"), or '''oseledets''' (Ukrainian: оселедець, "[[herring]]") is an element of traditional [[Ukrainian Cossack]] haircut. It describes a style of man's [[haircut]] that features a lock of hair sprouting from the top or the front of an otherwise closely shaven head. There are several Ukrainian surnames deriving from words ''chub'' and ''oseledets

==Colloquialism==
{{main|Khokhol}}
[[Russian people|Russians]] commonly use the word ''khokhol'' ({{lang-ru|хохо́л}}) as an [[ethnic slur]] for Ukrainians. The term is frequently derogatory or condescending, an equivalent of the Ukrainian term ''[[katsap]]'' ({{lang-ua|кацап}}) and Polish 
[[s:pl:wikt:kacap|''kacap'']] for Russians.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''coat of arms of [[Cameroon]]''' consists of a shield with a banner above and below it. Behind the shield are two crossed [[fasces]]. The shield has the same color pattern as the [[flag of Cameroon]], and in the center is a map of the nation. The scales of justice are superimposed on top of the map of the nation.

==Description==
The banner at the bottom gives the name of the nation in [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]. The top banner contains the national [[motto]]: {{Lang|fr|Paix, Travail, Patrie}}. The fasces are a symbol of the republic's authority, and the scales of justice represent justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/int/afr/cm-nat.htm National arms of Cameroon]&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous version of the state arms had text in French  only, with "République du Cameroun – 1er Janvier 1960" on a scroll above the shield, and "Paix, Travail, Patrie" below the shield.  The shield differed in that the green and yellow areas to left and right each had one large blue five-pointed star, while the central red area did not have a star on top (so that the blue map outline of Cameroon extended higher).&lt;ref&gt;''Guide to the Flags of the World'' by Mauro Talocci, revised and updated by Whitney Smith ({{ISBN|0-688-01141-1}}), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier coats of arms ==
===Proposed arms 1914===
In 1914, the German government decided to assign coats of arms to its overseas colonies, including Cameroon.  Arms were designed, but [[World War I]] broke out before the project was  finalised, and the arms were never actually taken into use. Giving the colonies their own insignia in time of war could let them have a symbol to rally around in case of rebellion. The arms proposed for [[Kamerun|the Imperial Colony of Cameroon]] depicted an elephant's head and the German imperial eagle on a chief. The eagle and the imperial crown on the shield was the same for all the proposed colonial arms.&lt;ref name=lv&gt;Schurdel, H.D. . Battenberg (1995).  ''Flaggen &amp; Wappen Deutschland - Heraldik, Hymnen, BRD &amp; DDR Flaggen und Wappen, Deutsche Ostgebiete, ehem. deutsche Kolonien u.v.m.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Col de la Madone transmitter''' is a very large broadcasting centre operated by [[Radio Monte Carlo]] north of Fontbonne, near [[Nice]] and [[Monaco]], in [[France]]. It was established in 1965 and was used until completion of [[Roumoules radio transmitter]] for longwave broadcasting, using 3 320 metres tall guyed mast radiators, which do not exist any more. It was used for broadcasting on 702&amp;nbsp;kHz and 1467&amp;nbsp;kHz. Both antennas consist of 2 guyed mast radiators insulated against ground. The masts of the antenna for 1467 kHz are 101 metres tall and oriented in North-South direction. The masts of the antenna for 702 kHz are oriented in East-West direction pointing towards Milan, as it is used for transmitting a radio program in Italian language toward Italy. The western mast of this antenna, which acts as reflector, has a height of 250 metres while the eastern mast which is the radiator is 215 metres taller.
A bit souther, there is close to a military radar site a centre for FM-broadcasting and on Mount Angel there is a 146 metres tall partially guyed tower, which consists of a grounded lattice tower as basement and a guyed mast radiator insulated against ground as top. It was built in 1946 and first used for mediumwave broadcasting, but is today used for TV-broadcasting. Nearby there is also the shortwave transmitter of RMC with several dipole walls.

'''Columbia 515''', previously named '''Intelsat VA F-15''' or '''Intelsat 515''', was a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Intelsat]] and which was later sold to [[CBS|Columbia Communications Corporation]]. Launched in 1989, it was the fifteenth of fifteen [[Intelsat V]] satellites to be launched. The Intelsat V series was constructed by [[Ford Aerospace]], based on the [[Spacebus|Intelsat-V]] [[satellite bus]].

Columbia 515 was part of an advanced series of satellites designed to provide greater telecommunications capacity for [[Intelsat]]'s global network. The satellite was deactivated on November, 2002.

The satellite was successfully launched into space on 27 January 1989, at 01:21 UTC, by means of an [[Ariane 2]] vehicle from the [[Guiana Space Centre]], [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]]. It had a launch mass of 2,013&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="TBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_intelsat_515.html|title=INTELSAT 515|publisher=TSE|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Columbia 515 was equipped with 6 [[Ku-band]] transponders more 29 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[transponder]]s for 15,000 audio circuits and 2 TV channels.

In November 1755, [[Pasquale Paoli]] proclaimed [[Corsica]] a [[sovereignty|sovereign nation]], the '''Corsican Republic''' ({{lang-it|Repubblica Corsa}}), independent from the [[Republic of Genoa]]. He created the [[Corsican Constitution]], which was the first [[constitution]] written in [[Italian language|Italian]] under [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles, including the first implementation of [[female suffrage]],&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Felli, "La renaissance du Paolisme". M. Bartoli, ''Pasquale Paoli, père de la patrie corse'', Albatros, 1974, p. 29. "Il est un point où le caractère précurseur des institutions paolines est particulièrement accusé, c'est celui du suffrage en ce qu'il était entendu de manière très large. Il prévoyait en effet le vote des femmes qui, à l'époque, ne votaient pas en France."&lt;/ref&gt; later revoked by the French when they took over the island in 1769. The republic created an [[Administration (government)|administration]] and [[justice system]], and founded an army.

==Foundation==
After a series of successful actions, Paoli drove the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] from the whole island except for a few coastal towns. He then set to work re-organizing the government, introducing many reforms. He founded a [[university]] at [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]] and created a short-lived "Order of Saint-Devote" in 1757 in honour of the patron saint of the island, [[Saint Devota]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gouv.mc/devwww/wwwnew.nsf/1909$/7f82f4dc1f0415d9c125706f00468819gb {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221155557/http://www.gouv.mc/devwww/wwwnew.nsf/1909%24/7F82F4DC1F0415D9C125706F00468819GB |date=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Corsican [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]], was composed of delegates elected from each district for three-year terms.  Suffrage was extended to all men over the age of 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The ungovernable rock: a history of the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom and its role in Britain's Mediterranean strategy during the Revolutionary War, 1793-1797 |first=Desmond |last=Gregory |year=1985 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |location=London |page=31 |ISBN=0-8386-3225-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, women had always voted in village elections for [[podestà]] i.e. village [[elder (administrative title)|elders]], and other local officials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The ungovernable rock: a history of the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom and its role in Britain's Mediterranean strategy during the Revolutionary War, 1793-1797 |first=Desmond |last=Gregory |year=1985 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |location=London |page=19 |ISBN=0-8386-3225-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been claimed that they also voted in national elections under the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Felli |first1=Lucien |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first=M |editor1-last=Bartoli  |title=Pasquale Paoli, père de la patrie corse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EigKAQAAIAAJ |year=1974 |publisher=Albatros |location=Paris |page=29 |chapter=La renaissance du Paolisme |quote=Il est un point où le caractère précurseur des institutions paolines est particulièrement accusé, c'est celui du suffrage en ce qu'il était entendu de manière très large.

The Republic minted its own coins at [[Murato, Haute-Corse|Murato]] in 1761, imprinted with the [[Moor's Head]], the traditional symbol of Corsica.

Paoli's ideas of independence, democracy and liberty gained support from such philosophers as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], [[Raynal]], and [[Gabriel Bonnot de Mably|Mably]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Power and the Nation in European History |last=Scales |first=Len |author2=Oliver Zimmer |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-84580-7 |page=289 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iv41_FKFfUQC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication in 1768 of ''[[An Account of Corsica]]'' by [[James Boswell]] made Paoli famous throughout Europe. [[Diplomatic recognition]] was extended to Corsica by the [[Bey of Tunis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pasquale Paoli: An Enlightened Hero 1725-1807 |last=Thrasher |first=Peter Adam  |year=1970 |publisher=Archon Books |location=Hamden, CT |isbn=0-208-01031-9 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French invasion==
{{Main|French conquest of Corsica}}
In 1767, Corsica took the island of [[Capraia]] from the Genoese who, one year later, despairing of ever being able to subjugate Corsica again, sold their claim to the [[Early modern France|Kingdom of France]] with the [[Treaty of Versailles (1768)|Treaty of Versailles]].

The French invaded Corsica the same year, and for a whole year Paoli's forces fought desperately for their new republic against the invaders. However, in May 1769, at the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]] they were defeated by vastly superior forces commanded by the [[Comte de Vaux]], and obliged to take refuge in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. French control was consolidated over the island, and in 1770 it became a [[French provinces|province]] of France.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Pascal Paoli01.jpg|thumb|120px|A statue of [[Pasquale Paoli]] in [[L'Île-Rousse]]]]
The fall of Corsica to the French was poorly received by many in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], which was Corsica's main ally and sponsor. It was seen as a failure of the Grafton Ministry that Corsica had been "lost", as it was regarded as vital to the interests of Britain in that part of the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Three Victories and a Defeat: The Rise and Fall of the First British Empire, 1714-1783 |last=Simms |first=Brendan |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-14-028984-8 |page=663}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Corsican Crisis]] severely weakened the [[Grafton Ministry]], contributing to its ultimate downfall. A number of exiled Corsicans fought for the British during the [[American Revolutionary War]], serving with particular distinction during the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]] in 1782.

Conversely, at the beginning of the same war, the New York militia later named ''[[Hearts of Oak (New York militia)|Hearts of Oak]]'' - whose membership  included [[Alexander Hamilton]] and other students at New York's King's College (now Columbia University) - originally called themselves "[[The Corsicans (New York militia)|The Corsicans]]", evidently considering the Corsican Republic as a model to be emulated in America.

The aspiration for Corsican independence, along with many of the democratic principles of the Corsican Republic, were revived by Paoli in the [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]] of 1794-1796. On that occasion, British naval and land forces were deployed in defence of the island; however, their efforts failed and the French regained control.

To this day, some [[Corsican separatists]] such as the (now-disbanded) [[Armata Corsa]], advocate the restoration of the island's republic.

[[File:Flag of French Sudan.svg|180px|thumb|right|Proportion: 2:3]]
The '''flag of [[French Sudan]]''' was the [[Flag of France|French tricolour]], used by most French colonial possessions, with a black [[stick figure]] with arms raised, a so-called ''kanaga''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-africa/west-africa/mali1/a/mask-kanaga-dogon-peoples|title=Mask (Kanaga) (Dogon peoples)|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The flag continued to be used when the colony gained autonomy from France in 1958, but its colors were changed to green, yellow and red with the adoption of the flag of the independent [[Mali Federation]] in 1959.

The '''Humber Bridge''', near [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England, is a {{convert|2220|m|yd+ft+mi|adj=mid}} single-span [[suspension bridge]], which opened to traffic on 24 June 1981. When it was opened, it was the longest of its type in the world; it was not surpassed until 1998, with the completion of the [[Akashi Kaikyō Bridge]], and it is now the [[List of longest suspension bridge spans|eighth-longest]]. It spans the [[Humber]], (the [[estuary]] formed by the rivers [[River Trent|Trent]] and [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Ouse]]), between [[Barton-upon-Humber]] on the south bank and [[Hessle]] on the north bank, thereby connecting the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] and [[North Lincolnshire]]. When it opened in 1981, both sides of the bridge were in the [[non-metropolitan county]] of [[Humberside]], until its dissolution in 1996. The bridge can be seen for miles around and from as far as [[Patrington]] in the East Riding of Yorkshire and out to sea miles off the East Yorkshire coast. It is a [[listed building|Grade I listed building]].

By 2006, the bridge carried an average of 120,000 vehicles per week.&lt;ref name="traffic"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.humberbridge.co.uk/trafficstatistics.php | title= Traffic statistics 1996–2006 | publisher= The Humber Bridge Board | accessdate= 26 December 2007 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120804093935/http://www.humberbridge.co.uk/trafficstatistics.php | archivedate= 4 August 2012 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The toll was £3.00 each way for cars (higher for commercial vehicles), which made it the most expensive toll crossing in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=mostexpensive&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-15128181 | publisher= BBC News | date= 1 October 2011 | accessdate= 1 October 2011 | title= Humber Bridge toll 'becomes UK's most expensive'}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, the toll was halved to £1.50 each way after the UK government deferred £150&amp;nbsp;million from the bridge's outstanding debt.&lt;ref name=tollreduction&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-17553448 | publisher= BBC News | date= 30 March 2012 | accessdate= 30 March 2012 | title= Humber Bridge toll reduction will 'boost economy'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-17577664|title=Humber Bridge travellers see toll reduction|date=1 April 2012|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--many paragraphs and subsections without citations--&gt;
Before the bridge opening, commuters would go from one bank to the other either by using the [[Humber Ferry]] that ran between Corporation Pier at Hull and [[New Holland Pier railway station|New Holland Pier]] at [[New Holland, North Lincolnshire|New Holland]], Lincolnshire or by driving via the [[M62 motorway|M62]] (from 1976), [[M18 motorway (Great Britain)|M18]] (from 1979) and [[M180 motorway|M180]] motorways, [[Ouse Bridge (M62)|crossing]] the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] near [[Goole]] (connected to the Humber) in the process. Until the mid-1970s, the route south was via the single-carriageway [[A63 road|A63]] and the [[A614 road|A614]] (via grid-locked [[Thorne, South Yorkshire|Thorne]] where it met the busy [[A18 road (England)|A18]] and crossed the [[Stainforth and Keadby Canal]] at a [[Keadby Bridge|swing bridge]] [[Traffic bottleneck|bottleneck]], and then on through [[Finningley]] and [[Bawtry]], meeting the east-west [[A631 road|A631]]).

The journey was a series of straight single-carriageway roads across foggy moors interrupted by predictable bottlenecks for most of the journey to [[Blyth, Nottinghamshire]], where it met the A1. The accident rate was consequently high, and the journey of most of Hull's traffic was similar to that faced by much of [[Transport in Lincolnshire|Lincolnshire]]'s drivers today. Debates in Parliament were held on the low standard of the windy route across the wind-swept plains around Goole. It was not unexpected that under these conditions, a Humber Bridge, with connecting dual-carriageway approach roads, and [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] junctions, would seem worthwhile. By the time the bridge opened, much of this well-below-standard route had been transformed by dualling of the A63 and its bypasses, the extension of the M62, and the much-needed connecting of the M18 from Thorne to [[Wadworth]]. The obvious need for a Humber Bridge had largely been tempered by the late 1970s with the much-improved [[List of motorways in the United Kingdom|motorway infrastructure]] of the region. Although welcome, the timing of these improvements would detract any significant levels of traffic needing to cross a bridge from Hessle to Barton. The Humber Bridge would be a victim of the M62's success, before opening.

There was also a short-lived hovercraft service; Minerva and Mercury linked Hull Pier and Grimsby Docks from February to October 1969, but suffered frequent mechanical failures.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}

===Act of Parliament===
Plans for a bridge were originally drawn up in the 1930s, and were revised in 1955, but work did not begin until 27 July 1972. The Humber Bridge Act, promoted by [[Kingston Upon Hull Corporation]], was passed in 1959. This established the Humber Bridge Board to manage and raise funds to build the bridge and buy the land required for the approach roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/2013/6/enacted | title = Humber Bridge Act 2013 | website = legislation.gov.uk | publisher =  [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] on behalf of [[Government of the United Kingdom|HM Government]] | accessdate = 22 June 2018  | quote = The Humber Bridge Act 1959 established the Humber Bridge Board ("the Board") and conferred powers on it to construct and maintain a bridge across the river Humber, together with approach roads and other works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1966 Hull North by-election===
However, raising the necessary funding proved impossible until the [[Hull North by-election, 1966|1966 Hull North by-election]]. To save his government, Labour Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] prevailed upon his [[Secretary of State for Transport|Minister of Transport]] [[Barbara Castle]] to sanction the building of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Millward | first = David  | title = Humber Bridge set to be electoral bribe again | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 7 April 2010 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/7560187/Humber-Bridge-set-to-be-electoral-bribe-again.html | accessdate = 22 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of action is known as ''[[pork barrel]]'', or an ''election sweetener''. Dismay at the long wait for a crossing led to the writing by Christopher Rowe of a protest song entitled "The Humber Bridge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.goole-on-the-web.org.uk/main.php?page=song |title = Songs for Humberside}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Humber Bridge under construction - geograph.org.uk - 1599900.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The deck under construction in May 1980. The deck was erected between October 1979 and July 1980]]

===Design===
The [[consulting engineer]]s for the project were [[Freeman Fox &amp; Partners]] – now [[Hyder Consulting]]. Sir [[Ralph Freeman (1911–1998)|Ralph Freeman]] had produced the first ideas in 1927, and in the early 1930s the cost of the project was thought to be around £1.725&amp;nbsp;million, and that the bridge would be unlikely to recoup the construction or maintenance costs. In 1935 he had an idea for a {{convert|4500|ft|m|adj=on}} suspension bridge for the Humber Tunnel Executive Committee. Sir [[Gilbert Roberts]] produced more ideas in 1955 for a bridge with a {{convert|4500|ft|m|adj=on}} central span, costing £15&amp;nbsp;million, to be paid for by [[East Riding County Council]] and [[Lindsey County Council]]. Once it was looking likely that a bridge would be constructed, [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]]-educated [[Bernard Wex]] OBE (24 April 1922 – 31 July 1990) produced the design in 1964 that was actually built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-27/news/mn-28_1_bridge-designer|title=Bernard Wex; British Bridge Designer|date=27 August 1990|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 he was awarded the [[Telford Medal]] by the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]]. In the 1950s he had helped to design [[High Marnham Power Station]]. He was a former UK chairman of the [[International Association of Bridge and Structural Engineers]], and helped to found the [[Steel Construction Institute]] in 1976.

The architect was R.E. Slater [[Royal Institute of British Architects|ARIBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=76|title=Engineering Timelines – Humber Bridge|publisher=engineering-timelines.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration building (for the tolls) was designed by Parker &amp; Rosner. The landscaping was designed by Prof Arnold Weddle. [[Wind tunnel]] testing took place at the National Maritime Institute (now part of [[BMT Limited]]) at [[Teddington]] in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]], and the road deck is designed for wind speeds up to {{convert | 105 | mph | -1}}.

===Construction===
The main contractor for the steel superstructure was British Bridge Builders (the same grouping as for the Forth and Severn Road Bridges comprising Sir William Arrol &amp; Co., then a unit of NEI Cranes Ltd, the Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering and Redpath Dorman Long Ltd). The contractor for the concrete towers, anchorages and sub-structure was [[John Howard (civil engineer)|John Howard &amp; Co Ltd]]&lt;ref&gt;″Bridging the Humber″ {{ISBN|0 9501098 6 X}} {{Full|date=May 2014}}{{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Chatham, Kent]], who were later bought by [[Amec Foster Wheeler|Amec]].

Work began on the southern approach road in July 1972 by [[Clugston Group|Clugston Construction]] of Scunthorpe. The {{cvt|2.5|km}} approach road to the A1077 junction, by [[Costain]] Civil Engineering began in September 1976. It included a {{cvt|320|m}} span from the southern anchorage of seven pre-stressed concrete box sections, and the A1077 junction, costing £4.25&amp;nbsp;million. Work on the bridge substructure (foundations) began in March 1973. To reduce heat of [[Hydration reaction|hydration]] in the concrete, which produces [[calcium silicate hydrate]] from [[belite]], as much as 60% of the [[Portland cement]] was replaced with [[ground granulated blast-furnace slag]] (GGBS). It took longer to build the southern anchorage due to a [[Slurry wall|diaphragm wall]] design due to not enough shallow bedrock. The main southern approach roads from Barton to the [[M180 motorway]] junction at [[Barnetby]] were built in the late 1970s by Clugston Construction of Scunthorpe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonby.org/photos/photo?photo_id=412692|title=Bonby, North Lincolnshire – Problem with your input|publisher=bonby.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007061758/http://www.bonby.org/photos/photo?photo_id=412692|archivedate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; opening in 1978.

The towers were constructed by [[Slip forming|slipforming]], and the north tower was completed by May 1974. The southern foundations were completed in September 1975, with the pier completed in March 1976, and the southern tower was completed by September 1976. The bridge itself had been planned to open in 1976. The northern tower and anchorage was built on solid chalk, but the southern tower and anchorage were built on fissured [[Kimmeridge Clay]], and 500 metres from the southern shore, and built with a difficult [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] design. The subcontractor for the concrete was Tileman &amp; Co. of [[Shipston-on-Stour]], south [[Warwickshire]].

Cable spinning took place between September 1977 and July 1979. Each cable weighs {{cvt|5500|tonne}}, with 37 strands of 404 lengths of cable. The cable on the northern span has four extra strands. Each cable can take a load of {{cvt|19400|tonne}}. The deck is of [[box girder]] form. The box sections weighed around {{cvt|140|tonne}} each. The first box sections were assembled in June 1975, and put into the main span on 9 November 1979. The toll buildings and north approach road were built by A.&amp;nbsp;F. Budge of [[Retford]], Nottinghamshire, costing £2.9&amp;nbsp;million. Work began on the administration building in November 1976. The toll system was manufactured by [[Siemens Plessey|Plessey Controls]] of [[Poole]], Dorset. Corrosion resistance on the steelwork was provided by Camrex Corrosion of [[Bellshill]], [[North Lanarkshire]].

The road was laid by [[Tarmac Group|Tarmac Roadstone]] of Wolverhampton with [[Asphalt concrete|mastic asphalt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciht.org.uk/download.cfm/docid/561403E9-8292-4B16-8C4590E9D97D10E4 The Highway Engineer July 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the bridge was designated a [[listed building|Grade I listed building]].&lt;ref name=BBC40626412&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-40626412/humber-bridge-given-grade-i-listed-status |title=Humber Bridge given Grade I listed status |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening===
The bridge opened to traffic on 24 June 1981.&lt;ref name="HBB History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humberbridge.co.uk/explore.php|title=Construction History|publisher=The Humber Bridge Board|accessdate=17 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206134602/http://www.humberbridge.co.uk/explore.php|archivedate=6 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was opened officially by Her Majesty, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on 17 July 1981.&lt;ref name="HBB History" /&gt;

===World record===
With a centre span of {{convert|1410|m|ft|0}} and a total length of {{convert|2220|m|ft|0}}, the Humber Bridge was the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world for 17 years, until Japan's [[Akashi Kaikyō Bridge]] opened on 5 April 1998. The road-distance between [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[Grimsby]] was reduced by nearly {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} as a consequence of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/calendar/2012-07-27/40-years-since-work-began-on-humber-bridge/|title=40 years since work began on Humber Bridge|publisher=ITV|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bridge statistics==
The bridge's surface takes the form of a [[dual carriageway]] with a lower-level foot and cyclepath on both sides. There is a permanent {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} speed limit on the full length of the bridge.

Each tower consists of a pair of hollow vertical concrete columns, each {{convert|155.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall and tapering from {{convert|6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} square at the base to {{convert|4.5|x|4.75|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}  at the top. The bridge is designed to tolerate constant motion and bends more than {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in winds of {{convert|80|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The towers, although both vertical, are {{convert|36|mm|in|1|abbr=in}} farther apart at the top than the bottom due to the [[curvature of the earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitgrimsby.co.uk/humber.htm|publisher=Visit Grimsby|title=The Humber Bridge|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The total length of the suspension cable is {{convert|71000|km|abbr=in}}.
The north tower is on the bank, and has foundations down to {{convert|8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The south tower is in the water, and descends to {{convert|36|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} as a consequence of the shifting [[sandbank]]s that make up the estuary.

The bridge held the record for the world's [[List of longest suspension bridges|longest single-span suspension bridge]] for 16 years from its opening in July 1981, until the opening of the [[Great Belt Bridge]] in June 1997, and was relegated to third place with the opening of the [[Akashi Kaikyō Bridge]] in April 1998. It is now the eighth longest single-span suspension bridge. The central span, at 1410&amp;nbsp;m (4640&amp;nbsp;ft), is the UK's longest. It remains the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world that one can cross on foot or by bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bike99.com/37.html Cycling the Bridge]{{dubious|date=March 2013|reason=Has anyone checked if the latest bridges to open can by cycled?}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The bridge is crossed twice during the annual Humber Bridge [[half marathon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humber-half.org.uk/|title=Humber Bridge Half Marathon Hull, East Yorkshire|last=|publisher=humber-half.org.uk|accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toll update project==
In July 2013, work began on introducing a new electronic tolling system.&lt;ref name="Toll Booth Update"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humberbridgetollproject.co.uk/ |title=Humber Bridge Toll project website|accessdate=4 November 2014  | archive-url =
https://web.archive.org/web/20141104234506/http://humberbridgetollproject.co.uk/the-new-toll-system | archivedate = 4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing Humber Bridge toll system was largely the same as it was when the bridge opened in 1981, and used a computer system that was over 15 years old. This obsolete technology required an increasing amount of maintenance and needed replacing.&lt;ref name="Toll Booth Update" /&gt; The project to update the tolls and the resulting decrease in waiting times was welcomed by business and transport leaders.&lt;ref name="Toll Booth Update"/&gt;

Phase one of the project focused on updating the infrastructure and saw all the toll booths replaced as well as the toll plaza canopy. Phase two concentrated on writing, testing, and setting up the new toll system. The project completed in 2015 allowing bridge users to set up an account with the bridge and pay into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = More than 100 near misses as drivers try to reverse out of wrong lane | newspaper = [[The Yorkshire Post]] | date = 25 October 2017 | url = https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/more-than-100-near-misses-as-drivers-try-to-reverse-out-of-wrong-lane-1-8823095 | accessdate = 22 June 2018 | quote = The open road system, which was introduced in 2015, allows people to pay tickets electronically via the HumberTag website.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Account holders receive a device called the HumberTAG, a small electronic tag that enables the system to recognise the bridge user and the toll is automatically deducted from the user's account. The two central lanes through the plaza are free-flow lanes: they do not have any booths and account holders are able to cross the bridge without stopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.humberbridge.co.uk/humbertag/about.php | title = HumberTAG | publisher = The Humber Bridge Board | accessdate = 22 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents and suicides==
During construction of the bridge, the road deck sections were floated up on barges then hoisted into place by cables. During one of these lifting operations some of the cables on one of the road deck sections failed, leaving the section hanging at an angle. The section was, however, subsequently rescued and used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/humber/content/image_galleries/humber_bridge_building_gallery.shtml?12 | title= Humber Bridge road deck failure|date=October 2008|accessdate=17 March 2013|work=Humberside|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 200 incidents of people jumping or falling from the bridge have taken place since it was opened in 1981; only five have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/6747383.stm | title= Bridge jump attempts prevented | date= 13 June 2007 | accessdate= 25 February 2010 | publisher= BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1990 and February 2001 the Humber Rescue Team launched its boat 64 times to deal with people falling or jumping off the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Notable incidents include the cases of a [[West Yorkshire]] woman and her two-year-old daughter who fell off the bridge in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/4085000.stm | title= Pair recover from bridge plunge | date= 12 June 2006 | accessdate= 4 September 2006 | publisher= BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;
a mother who killed herself and her 12-year-old son with [[Fragile X Syndrome]] in April 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/4958012.stm | title= Body discovered after bridge jump | date= 29 April 2006 | accessdate= 4 September 2006 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/4783517.stm|title=Bridge-fall son unlawfully killed |date=11 August 2006|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that of a man jumping from the bridge to his death on the [[A63 road]] below in September 2006. 

As a result, plans were announced on 26 December 2009 to construct a [[suicide barrier]] along the walkways of the bridge; design constraints were cited as the reason for non-implementation before this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/news/New-Humber-Bridge-fence-stop-suicide-bids/article-1644192-detail/article.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505080143/http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/news/New-Humber-Bridge-fence-stop-suicide-bids/article-1644192-detail/article.html |dead-url=yes |archivedate=5 May 2013 |title=New Humber Bridge fence to stop suicide bids |work=Hull and East Riding Mail |date=26 December 2009 |accessdate=17 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, a [[YouTube]]r with the username 'Night Scape', along with a small group, illegally scaled the bridge without safety equipment. The group of young men climbed up the structure to the top of the bridge whilst using the suspension wires as handholds. [[Humberside Police]] and the Humber Bridge Board are reviewing the security measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-39947762 |title=Humber Bridge 'urban explorers' prompts security review |publisher=BBC News |date= 17 May 2017|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finances==
The bridge has a [[Toll bridge|toll charge]] of £1.50 for cars{{when?|date=August 2018}}. Until 1 April 2012 the Humber Bridge was the only major toll bridge in the United Kingdom to charge tolls to motorcycles (£1.20); others such as the [[Severn crossing]]s and the [[Dartford Crossing]] are free. In 2004, a large number of motorcyclists held a slow-pay protest, taking off gloves and helmets and paying the toll in large denomination bank notes.
Police reported a tailback of {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} as a consequence of the protest.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}

In 1996, the British Parliament passed the [[Humber Bridge (Debts) Act 1996]] to reorganise the Humber Bridge Board's debts to ensure the bridge could be safely maintained. Although a significant proportion of the debt was suspended in that refinancing arrangement there was no "write off" of debt and the suspended portion is being gradually re-activated as the Bridge Board pays off the remainder of the active debt.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}

In 2006 a [[Private Member's Bill]] – sponsored by [[Cleethorpes]] Labour MP [[Shona McIsaac]] – relating to the Humber Bridge, was introduced into Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.yorkshiretoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1084&amp;ArticleID=1321965 | work= Yorkshire Post | title= MP in Commons move to exempt hospital patients from bridge toll | date= 20 January 2006 | accessdate=13 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Humber Bridge Bill would have made amendments to the Humber Bridge Act 1959 "requiring the secretary of state to give directions to members of the Humber Bridge Board regarding healthcare and to review the possibility of facilitating journeys across the Humber Bridge in relation to healthcare". The aim was to allow people who travel from the southbank to the northbank for medical treatment to cross the bridge without paying the toll, and to allow the Secretary of State for Transport to appoint two members of the Humber Bridge board to represent the interests of the NHS. Even though the Bill received cross-party support (it was co-sponsored by Shadow Home Secretary [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], and supported by all other MPs representing North Lincolnshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire) it ran out of time later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In October 2008, a joint campaign was launched by the ''Scunthorpe Telegraph'', ''Hull Daily Mail'' and ''Grimsby Telegraph'' to abolish the fee for crossing the Humber. The papers' A Toll Too Far campaign garnered much support from councillors and MPs serving Lincolnshire and Humberside and was launched in response to a mooted increase in the cost of bridge crossings. The campaign's aim was not only to stave off any potential increase in crossing charges, but to ultimately see the costs abolished. A reduction to a £1 charge for bridge crossings was a sought-after alternative. Thousands of readers backed the campaign with a paper and an online petition.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}

A public inquiry into the tolls was held in March 2009 by independent inspector Neil Taylor. In July 2009, the [[Department for Transport]] announced that it had decided not to allow the proposed increase. Transport Minister [[Sadiq Khan]] said he did not believe it was right for the tolls to be raised in the current economic climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = [[BBC News]]  | title = No rise for Humber Bridge tolls  | date = 30 July 2009  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/8177060.stm  | accessdate = 6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] approved a £6&amp;nbsp;million grant for [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintenance]] costs, which meant that there would be no toll increase before 2011 at the earliest, by which time tolls would have been frozen for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[BBC News]]  | title = No bridge toll rise for 18 months  | date = 27 October 2009  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/8327862.stm  | accessdate = 6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Humber Bridge Board applied again to the Department of Transport in September 2010, to raise the tolls from April 2011, but the Government ordered a public inquiry to be held into the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-11444061|title=Humber Bridge toll rise bid prompts public inquiry|date=30 September 2010|work=BBC News Humberside|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-day public inquiry was held in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in early March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-12673527|title=Inquiry into Humber Bridge toll increase plan|date=8 March 2011|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the recommendation by the planning inspector the Government gave approval, on 14 June 2011, for the increase to go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-13763317|title=Humber Bridge 11% toll increase approved|date=14 June 2011|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toll was raised on 1 October 2011, at which point it became the most expensive toll crossing in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=mostexpensive/&gt; The [[Severn Bridge]] and [[Second Severn Crossing]] charge a toll of £5.70,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.severnbridge.co.uk/toll_prices.shtml | publisher= Severn River Crossing PLC | title= Toll Prices | accessdate= 1 October 2011 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927174238/http://www.severnbridge.co.uk/toll_prices.shtml | archivedate= 27 September 2011 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is only collected in one direction.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}

In the 2011 Autumn Statement on 29 November, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[George Osborne]], announced that the Government had agreed to reduce the debt on the bridge by £150&amp;nbsp;million, which would allow the toll for cars to be halved to £1.50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-15945226|title=Government agrees to halve Humber Bridge tolls|date=29 November 2011|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the government accepting the agreement, between the four local councils, to underwrite the remaining debt Transport Secretary [[Justine Greening]] confirmed the reduction in tolls on 29 February 2012. This was implemented in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-17209784|title=Humber Bridge tolls to be halved|date=29 February 2012|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jasná Páka''' is a Czech rock band.

'''Kowloon Walled City''' was a [[Anarchy|largely ungoverned]], [[population density|densely populated]] settlement in [[Kowloon City]] in [[Hong Kong]]. Originally a [[Qing dynasty|Chinese]] military [[fort]], the Walled City became an [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] after the [[New Territories]] were leased to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by China in 1898. Its population increased dramatically following the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]] during [[World War II]]. By 1990, the Walled City contained 50,000 residents&lt;ref name="DailyMail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nosowitz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nosowitz|first=Dan|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-04/life-inside-most-densely-populated-place-earth-infographic#page-2|title=Life Inside The Most Densely Populated Place On Earth [Infographic]|website=Popular Science|publisher=[[Popular Science]]|quote="1990 50,000 inhabitants"|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; within its {{convert|2.6|ha|acre|adj=on}} borders. From the 1950s to the 1970s, it was controlled by local [[Triad (underground society)|triad]]s and had high rates of [[prostitution]], [[gambling]] and [[drug abuse]].

In January 1987, the [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]] announced plans to [[demolition|demolish]] the Walled City. After an arduous [[eviction]] process, demolition began in March 1993 and was completed in April 1994. [[Kowloon Walled City Park]] opened in December 1995 and occupies the area of the former Walled City. Some historical [[artifact (archaeology)|arte&lt;!-- NOTE! Do not change this to "artifacts"! This article uses Hong Kong English spelling, where "artefacts" is the correct spelling. --&gt;facts]] from the Walled City, including its [[yamen]] building and remnants of its South Gate, have been [[conservation-restoration|preserved]] there.

==History==
===Military outpost===
[[File:Kowloon-Walled-City-1898.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lung Tsun Stone Bridge]] and Lung Tsun Pavilion (Pavilion for Greeting Officials) of Kowloon Walled City in 1898|alt=The front entrance of a fort with mountains in the background.]]

The history of the Walled City can be traced back to the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), when an outpost was set up to manage the trade of [[salt]]. Little took place for hundreds of years afterward, although 30 guards were stationed there in 1668.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; A small coastal fort was established around 1810.&lt;ref name="Sinn"/&gt; In 1842, during [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] [[Daoguang Emperor|Emperor Daoguang]]'s reign, [[Hong Kong Island]] was ceded to Britain by the [[Treaty of Nanking|Treaty of Nanjing]]. As a result, the Qing authorities felt it necessary to improve the fort in order to rule the area and check further British influence. The improvements, including the formidable [[defensive wall]], were completed in 1847. The Walled City was captured by rebels during the [[Taiping Rebellion]] in 1854 before being retaken a few weeks later.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Li Long Lam]], [http://www.nssd.org/articles/article_detail.aspx?id=24822524 Excavation Report of Kowloon Walled City, Hong Kong](香港九龙寨城发掘简报)", in ''Kaogu'', vol. 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The present Walled City's "Dapeng Association House" forms the remnants of what was previously [[Lai Enjue]]'s garrison.

[[File:Victoria City and Kowloon 1915.jpg|thumb|left|1915 map of the Hong Kong region with the Kowloon Walled City listed as "Chinese Town" at the upper right-hand corner]]
The [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory]] of 1898 handed additional parts of Hong Kong (the [[New Territories]]) to Britain for 99 years, but excluded the Walled City, which at the time had a population of roughly 700. China was allowed to continue to keep officials there as long as they did not interfere with the defence of [[British Hong Kong]]. The following year, the Governor, Sir [[Henry Arthur Blake|Henry Blake]], suspected that the Viceroy of Canton was using troops to aid resistance to the new arrangements. On 16 May 1899, British forces attacked the Walled City, only to find the Viceroy's soldiers gone, leaving behind only the [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] and 150 residents.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; The Qing dynasty ended its rule in 1912, leaving the Walled City to the British.

Though the British claimed ownership of the Walled City, they did little with it over the following few decades. The Protestant church established an [[Retirement home|old people's home]] in the old "yamen" (Chinese meaning administrative office) as well as a school and an [[almshouse]] in other former offices. Aside from such institutions, however, the Walled City became a mere curiosity for British colonials and tourists to visit; it was labelled as "Chinese Town" in a 1915 map. In 1933, the Hong Kong authorities announced plans to demolish most of the decaying Walled City's buildings, compensating the 436 squatters that lived there with new homes. By 1940 only the yamen, the school and one house remained. During its [[World War II]] [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|occupation of Hong Kong]], [[Japan]] demolished the City's wall and used the stone to expand the nearby [[Kai Tak Airport]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;

===Urban settlement===
[[File:KWC - 1972 Sing Tao.jpg|thumb|right|An aerial view of the Kowloon Walled City and the neighboring Sai Tau Tsuen village in 1972]]

After [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in 1945, [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]] announced its intent to reclaim its rights to the Walled City. Refugees from mainland China because of the Chinese Civil War post 1945 poured in to take advantage of British protection (the Walled City was a Chinese territory but surrounded by British land), and 2,000 [[Squatting|squatters]] occupied the Walled City by 1947. After a failed attempt to drive them out in 1948, the British adopted a 'hands-off' policy in most matters concerning the Walled City.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson" /&gt;

[[File:KWC - 1975.jpg|thumb|left|The south side of the Kowloon Walled City in 1975. The elevation of the buildings begins to reach its maximum height.]]

In January 1950, a fire broke out that destroyed over 2,500 huts, home to nearly 3,500 families and 17,000 total people.&lt;ref name = "Smart2006" /&gt; The disaster highlighted the need for proper [[fire prevention]] in the largely wooden-built squatter areas, complicated by the lack of political ties with the colonial and Chinese governments.&lt;ref name="Smart2006_2" /&gt; The ruins gave new arrivals to the Walled City the opportunity to build anew, causing speculation that the fire may have been intentionally set.&lt;ref name = "Smart2006_2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Booth2006" /&gt;

With no government enforcement from the Chinese or the British aside from a few raids by the [[Hong Kong Police]], the Walled City became a haven for crime and drugs. It was only during a 1959 trial for a murder that occurred within the Walled City that the Hong Kong government was ruled to have jurisdiction there. By this time, however, the Walled City was virtually ruled by the organised crime syndicates known as [[Triad (underground societies)|triads]].&lt;ref name ="Wilkinson" /&gt;

Beginning in the 1950s, triad groups such as the [[14K Triad|14K]] and [[Sun Yee On]] gained a stranglehold on the Walled City's countless [[brothel]]s, [[Casino|gambling parlors]], and [[opium den]]s. The Walled City had become such a haven for criminals that police would venture into it only in large groups.&lt;ref name = scmp&gt;{{cite news|last=Carney|first=John|title=Kowloon Walled City: Life in the City of Darkness| url = http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1191748/kowloon-walled-city-life-city-darkness | accessdate = 29 January 2014 | newspaper = [[South China Morning Post]] | date = 16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until 1973–74, when a series of more than 3,500 police raids resulted in over 2,500 arrests and over {{convert |1800|kg}} of seized drugs, that the triads' power began to wane. With public support, particularly from younger residents, the continued raids gradually eroded drug use and violent crime. In 1983, the police commander of [[Kowloon City District]] declared the Walled City's crime rate to be under control.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson" /&gt;

[[File:Kowloon Walled City - 1991.jpg|left|thumb|One of the outer edges in 1991]]
The City also underwent massive construction during the 1960s, with developers building new modular structures above older ones. The city became extremely densely populated, with over 30,000 people in 300 buildings occupying little more than {{convert|7|acre}}. As a result, the city reached its maximum size by the late 1970s and early 1980s; a height restriction of 13 to 14 storeys had been imposed on the city due to the flight path of planes heading towards [[Kai Tak Airport]].&lt;ref name = "p48" /&gt; As well as limiting building height, the proximity of the airport subjected residents to serious noise pollution for the last 20 years of the city's existence. Eight municipal pipes provided water to the entire structure, although more could have come from wells.&lt;ref name = "Water"/&gt; A few of the streets were illuminated by [[fluorescent light]]s, as sunlight rarely reached the lower levels due to the outstanding disregard to [[air rights]] within the city.&lt;ref name = "Wilkinson" /&gt; Although the rampant crime of earlier decades diminished in later years, the Walled City was still known for its high number of unlicensed [[Physician|doctors]] and [[dentist]]s, who could operate there without threat of prosecution.&lt;ref name = "Vines" /&gt;

Although the Walled City was for many years a hotbed of criminal activity, most residents were not involved in any crime and lived peacefully within its walls. Numerous small factories and businesses thrived inside the Walled City, and some residents formed groups to organise and improve daily life there.&lt;ref name= "Basler" /&gt; An attempt by the government in 1963 to demolish some shacks in a corner of the City gave rise to an "anti-demolition committee" that served as the basis for a [[Kaifong association]]. Charities, religious societies, and other welfare groups were gradually introduced to the City. While medical clinics and schools went unregulated, the Hong Kong government did provide some services, such as water supply and mail delivery.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson" /&gt;

===Eviction and demolition===
[[File:KWC - Alley.jpg|thumb|right|180px|An alley in the city]]

Over time, both the British and the Chinese governments found the City to be increasingly intolerable despite a reduction in the reported crime rate.&lt;ref name="DailyMail"/&gt; The quality of life in the City—sanitary conditions in particular—remained far behind the rest of Hong Kong. The [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] in 1984 laid the groundwork for the City's demolition.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; The mutual decision by the two governments to tear down the Walled City was announced on 14{{nbsp}}January 1987.&lt;ref name="Goddard"/&gt; On 10 March 1987, following the announcement that the Walled City would be converted to a park, the Secretary for District Administration formally requested the [[Urban Council]] agree to take over the site following demolition. Owing to the presence of numerous other green spaces in the area, the [[Urban Services Department]] doubted the need for "yet another park" from a planning and operations point of view, but the council agreed nonetheless to accept the government's proposal on the condition that the government bear the cost of park construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum for Members of the Recreation Select Committee, Capital Works Select Committee, Finance Select Committee, and the Standing Committee of the Whole Council: Proposed Park at the site of Kowloon Walled City|publisher=Urban Council|date=10 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum for Members of the Recreation Select Committee: Proposed Park Development at The Kowloon Walled City Site|publisher=Urban Council|date=7 September 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government distributed some {{HKD|2.7 billion}} ({{USD|350 million}}) in compensation to the estimated 33,000 residents and businesses in a plan devised by a special committee of the [[Hong Kong Housing Authority]].&lt;ref name="Lau" /&gt; Some residents were not satisfied with the compensation and were forcibly evicted between November 1991 and July 1992.&lt;ref name="Families"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Braude"/&gt; After four months of planning,&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt; demolition of the Walled City began on 23{{nbsp}}March 1993&lt;ref name="Vines"/&gt; and concluded in April 1994.

The park's design is modelled on [[Jiangnan]] [[Chinese garden|gardens]] of the early [[Qing Dynasty]]. It is divided into eight landscape features,&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; with the fully restored [[yamen]] as its centrepiece. The park's paths and [[pavilions]] are named after streets and buildings in the Walled City.&lt;ref name="YamenPark"/&gt; Arte&lt;!-- NOTE! Do not change this to "Artifacts"! This article uses Hong Kong English spelling, where "Artefacts" is the correct spelling. --&gt;facts from the Walled City, such as five inscribed stones and three old wells, are also on display in the park.&lt;ref name="Film"/&gt; The park was designed by the [[Architectural Services Department]], which won a "prestigious award" from the Central Society of Horticulture of Germany for the redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ng|first1=Kang-Chung|title=Walled City park project wins top award|work=South China Morning Post|date=12 January 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Image-Kowloon Walled City southgate.jpg|right|thumb|The remnants of the City's South Gate and its entrance plaques|alt=On a green lawn surrounded by a brick wall lie broken engraved stones and stone foundations.]]

Components of the park include:
* The Eight Floral Walks, each named after a different plant or flower&lt;ref name="Walks"/&gt;
* The Chess Garden, featuring four {{convert|3|by|5|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Chinese chess]]boards&lt;ref name="Chess"/&gt;
* The Garden of [[Chinese zodiac]], containing stone statues of the 12 [[Chinese zodiac]] animals&lt;ref name="Zodiac"/&gt;
* The Garden of Four Seasons (named Guangyin Square after the small open area in the Walled City), a {{convert|300|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} garden with plants that symbolise the four seasons&lt;ref name="Seasons"/&gt;
* The Six Arts Terrace, a {{convert|600|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} wedding area containing a garden and the Bamboo Pavilion&lt;ref name="Film"/&gt;
* The Kuixing Pavilion, including a [[moon gate]] framed by two stone tablets and the towering Guibi Rock, which represents Hong Kong's return to China&lt;ref name="Guibi"/&gt;
* The Mountain View Pavilion, a two-storey structure resembling a docked boat that provides a good view of the entire park&lt;ref name="Film"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mountain"/&gt;

The [[Antiquities and Monuments Office]] conducted archaeological examinations as the Walled City was being demolished, and several cultural remains were discovered.&lt;ref name="GIS"/&gt; Among them were the Walled City's yamen and remnants of its South Gate, which were officially designated [[declared monuments of Hong Kong]] on 4 October 1996.&lt;ref name="Monuments"/&gt;

The South Gate had originally served as the Walled City's main entrance. Along with its foundation, other remains included two stone plaques inscribed with "South Gate" and "Kowloon Walled City" from the South Gate and a flagstone path that had led up to it. The foundations of the City's wall and East Gate were also discovered.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; The Hong Kong government preserved the South Gate remnants next to a square in front of the yamen.&lt;ref name="GatePark"/&gt;

The yamen building is made up of three halls. Originally the middle hall served the Assistant Magistrate of Kowloon's administrative office, and the rear block was his residence. After the government officials left the area in 1899, it was used for several other purposes, including an old people's home, a refuge for widows and orphans, a school, and a clinic. It was restored in 1996 and is now found near the centre of the park.&lt;ref name="Yamen"/&gt; It contains a photo gallery of the Walled City, and two [[cannon]] dating back to 1802 sit at the sides of its entrance.&lt;ref name="YamenPark"/&gt;

==Layout and architecture==
[[File:Kowloon Walled City Statue.jpg|thumb|Model of Kowloon Walled City located at the entrance of Kowloon Walled City Park]]

The Walled City was located in what became known as the [[Kowloon City]] [[List of places in Hong Kong|area]] of Kowloon. In spite of its transformation from a fort into an urban enclave, the Walled City retained the same basic layout. The original fort was built on a slope&lt;ref name="p18"/&gt; and consisted of a {{convert|2.6|ha|sqmi|adj=on}} plot measuring about {{convert|210|by|120|m|ft}}. The stone wall surrounding it had four entrances and measured {{convert|4|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|4.6|m|ft}} thick before it was dismantled in 1943.&lt;ref name="Sinn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benedetti"/&gt;

[[File:Kowloon Walled City.jpg|thumb|left|The Kowloon Walled City in 1989.]]

|label={{small|Kowloon Walled City}}
|position=right
|caption={{small|The City's former location within Hong Kong}}}}

Construction surged dramatically during the 1960s and 1970s, until the formerly [[low-rise]] City consisted almost entirely of buildings with 10 storeys or more (with the notable exception of the yamen in its centre).&lt;ref name="p48"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goddard"/&gt; However, due to the Kai Tak Airport's position {{convert|800|m|mi}} south of the City, buildings did not exceed 14 storeys.&lt;ref name="p206"/&gt; The two-storey Sai Tau Tsuen settlement bordered the Walled City to the south and west until it was cleared in 1985 and replaced with [[Carpenter Road Park]].&lt;ref name="Girard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p71"/&gt;

The City's dozens of [[alley]]ways were often only {{convert|1|–|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, and had poor lighting and drainage.&lt;ref name="W-S"/&gt; An informal network of [[staircase]]s and passageways also formed on upper levels, which was so extensive that one could travel north to south through the entire City without ever touching solid ground.&lt;ref name="p48"/&gt; Construction in the City went unregulated, and most of the roughly 350 buildings were built with poor [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]] and few or no [[public utility|utilities]].&lt;ref name="p48,74,79"/&gt; Because apartments were so small—a typical unit was {{convert|23|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}—space was maximised with wider upper floors, caged balconies and rooftop additions.&lt;ref name="Basler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goddard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p34,199"/&gt; [[Roof]]s in the City were full of television antennae, [[clothes line]]s, water tanks and rubbish, and could be crossed using a series of ladders.&lt;ref name="Popham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p199,203"/&gt;

==Population==
[[File:KWC - Night.jpg|thumb|right|A street at the edge of the city at night.]]
Kowloon Walled City's early population fluctuated between zero and a few hundred, and began growing steadily shortly after World War II. However, there is no accurate population information available for much of the Walled City's later existence. Official [[census]] numbers estimated the Walled City's population at 10,004 in 1971 and 14,617 in 1981, but these figures were commonly considered to be much too low. Informal estimates, on the other hand, often mistakenly included the neighbouring [[squatter village]] of Sai Tau Tsuen.&lt;ref name="W-S"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Siu-Fong"/&gt; Population figures of about 50,000 were also reported.&lt;ref name="DailyMail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nosowitz"/&gt;

A thorough government survey in 1987 gave a clearer picture: an estimated 33,000 people resided within the Walled City. Based on this survey, the Walled City had a population density of approximately {{convert|1,255,000|PD/sqkm|PD/sqmi}} in 1987,&lt;ref name="Goddard"/&gt; making it the most densely populated spot in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickassfacts.com/17-densely-populated-places-earth/2/|title=17 Most Densely Populated Places on Earth|date=26 October 2013|website=kickassfacts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

[[File:KWC - Playground.jpg|thumb|A playground at the edge of the city.]]
Contrary to what many outsiders believed, most residents of the Walled City behaved similarly to other [[Hong Kong people|Hong Kong]] natives.&lt;ref name="p90"/&gt; In response to difficult living conditions, the residents formed a tightly knit community, helping one another endure various hardships.&lt;ref name="p122"/&gt; Within families, wives often did housekeeping, while grandmothers cared for their grandchildren and other children from surrounding households.&lt;ref name="p115,154"/&gt; The City's rooftops were an important gathering place, especially for residents who lived on upper floors. Parents used them to relax, and children would play or do homework there after school.&lt;ref name="p203–04"/&gt;

The yamen in the heart of the City was also a major social centre, a place for residents to talk, have tea or watch television, and to take classes such as calligraphy. The Old People's Centre also held religious meetings for Christians and others.&lt;ref name="p132"/&gt; Other religious institutions included the Fuk Tak and [[Tin Hau temples in Hong Kong|Tin Hau]] temples, which were used for a combination of [[Buddhist]], [[Taoist]], and [[animist]] practices.&lt;ref name="p26,139"/&gt;

===Memoirs and autobiographies===

A few of the people who spent time in Kowloon Walled City have written accounts of their experiences. Evangelist [[Jackie Pullinger]] wrote a 1989 memoir, ''Crack in the Wall'', about her involvement in treating drug addicts within the Walled City.&lt;ref name="Pullinger"/&gt; In his 2004 autobiography ''Gweilo'', [[Martin Booth]] describes his exploration of the Walled City as a child in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="McDonogh"/&gt;

{{Quote box |width= 30em |align= right |salign= right
|quote= The Walled City of Kowloon has no visible wall around it, but it is as clearly defined as if there were one made of hard, high steel. It is instantly sensed by the congested open market that runs along the street in front of the row of dark run-down flats—shacks haphazardly perched on top of one another giving the impression that at any moment the entire blighted complex will collapse under its own weight, leaving nothing but rubble where elevated rubble had stood.

The filth, squalor and the crime-oriented nature of the area is described vividly when the characters Marissa and Tristan Williams pass by the back-lanes. The later part of episode 3 and episode 4 of the anime ''[[Street Fighter II V]]'' are set in the Kowloon Walled City, depicted as a dark and lawless area where Ryu, Ken and Chun-Li have to fight for their lives at every turn, being rescued by the police once they reach the Walled City's limits.

==History==

LNEC was created on November 19, 1946, from the Laboratory for Materials Testing and Study of the Ministry of Public Works and the Center for Civil Engineering Studies, based at the ''Instituto Superior Técnico''. This double-strand, research and experimentation, would decisively shape the future development of LNEC.

On June 20, 1987, LNEC was made Honorary Member of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword and on November 19, 1987, was made Honorary Member of the Military Order of Christ.

LNEC carries out research activities in the fields as follows: public works, housing, town planning, environment, water resources, estuaries, coastal areas, transportation and communication networks, materials industry, building components and other products. The main purpose of these activities is to contribute to:
* the quality and safety of works;
* the protection and rehabilitation of the natural and built patrimony;
* the technological modernisation and innovation in the building sector;
* the minimisation of natural and technological hazards;
* the development of natural resources from a viewpoint of sustainable development.

 
Those activities are as follows:
* Planned research of a strategic nature, developed within research lines considered as priority due to their relevance for the country.
* Studies and expert reports under contract: advanced expert advisory services to public and private bodies, both national and foreign.
* Promotion of quality in construction: preparation of specifications, norms and regulations, approval and classification of new building materials and components, observation of the performance of works, certification of building projects by LNEC "Quality Mark" and normal tests.
* Dissemination of knowledge, as well as technical and scientific training: preparation of scientific and technical documents, organisation of technical courses or other training actions, organisation of scientific and technical meetings, both national and foreign, complemented by the publishing activity and by the Library.
* Co-operation with other bodies: activities of co-operation with various Portuguese and foreign bodies, namely with associations of a scientific and technical character, universities, laboratories and other institutions.

A '''Luxembourgish passport''' is an international [[travel document]] issued to nationals of the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]], and may also serve as proof of [[Luxembourgish nationality law|Luxembourgish citizenship]]. Besides enabling the bearer to travel internationally and serving as indication of Luxembourgish citizenship, the passport facilitates the process of securing assistance from Luxembourgish consular officials abroad or other [[European Union member states]] in case a Luxembourgish consular is absent, if needed.

According to the 2017 [[Visa_(document)#Visa_Restrictions_Index|Visa Restrictions Index]], Luxembourgish citizens can visit 173 countries without a [[Visa (document)|visa]] or with a visa granted on arrival. Additionally, the [[World Tourism Organization]] also published a report on 15 January 2016 ranking the Luxembourgish passport 1st in the world (tied with Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Singapore and the United Kingdom passports) in terms of travel freedom, with the mobility index of 160 (out of 215 with no visa weighted by 1, visa on arrival weighted by 0.7, eVisa by 0.5 and traditional visa weighted by 0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visa Openness Report 2016|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf|publisher=World Tourism Organization|accessdate=17 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123123959/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf|archivedate=23 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luxembourgish citizens can live and work in any member state of the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland as a result of the right of freedom of movement granted in [[Treaties of the European Union|Article 21 of the EU Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF Treaty on the Function of the European Union] (consolidated version)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Every Luxembourgish citizen is also a [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizen of the European Union]]. The [[passport]], along with the [[Luxembourgish identity card|national identity card]] allows for freedom of movement in any of the states of the [[European Economic Area]] and [[Switzerland]].

Luxembourgish biometric passports are valid for five years for bearers aged four and over, and valid for 2 years for children under four.

'''Madeleine Collinson''' (22 July 1952 – 14 August 2014) was a [[Maltese people|Maltese]]-[[British people|British]] model and actress. She was chosen as ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine's [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate of the Month]] in October 1970, together with her twin sister [[Mary Collinson]]. They were the first [[identical twin]] Playmate sisters.

==Career==
The Collinson twins first arrived in Britain in April 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Sheridan |title=Keeping the British End Up: Four Decades of Saucy Cinema |publisher=Reynolds &amp; Hearn Books |edition=3rd |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-9529260-7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prior to their appearance in ''Playboy'' one of the first people to use them was the glamour photographer/film maker [[Harrison Marks]] who cast them as saucy maids in his short film ''Halfway Inn''. The film, made for the 8mm market, was shot sometime between their British arrival, and July 1970, when a still from the film was used in a Marks' advert that ran in that month's issue of ''Continental Film Review'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Halfway Inn |magazine=Continental Film Review |date=July 1970 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
   
Both sisters went on to acting careers, mostly in B-movies. Madeleine married a British [[Royal Air Force]] officer and raised three children. She later moved back to Malta and was involved in cultural and educational activities there. In her final years, Madeleine Collinson lived in [[San Gwann]] [[Malta]]. After several months of illness, she died at [[Mater Dei Hospital]] in [[Msida]] on 14 August 2014 with her twin sister Mary present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/movie-news/9466-madeleine-collinson-rip|title=Madeleine Collinson, R.I.P.|work=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]|date=16 August 2014|first=Martin|last=Unsworth|accessdate=6 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906203610/http://www.starburstmagazine.com/movie-news/9466-madeleine-collinson-rip|archivedate=6 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/madeleine-collinson-playboy-centrefold-model-who-also-appeared-with-her-sister-mary-in-the-horror-9856981.html |title=Madeleine Collinson: Playboy centrefold model who also appeared with her sister Mary in the horror film Twins of Evil |first=Simon |last=Farquhar |authorlink=Simon Farquhar |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malta–Spain relations''' refer to foreign relations between [[Malta]] and [[Spain]].  Both countries established mutual diplomatic relations in 1977 {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.  Malta has an embassy in [[Madrid]] and 5 honorary consulates (in [[Barcelona]], [[Palma de Mallorca]], [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], [[Seville]] and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]). Spain has an embassy in [[Ta' Xbiex]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malta.com/en/local-information/public-service/embassy/spain&lt;/ref&gt; and Cultural Centre in [[Balzan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spanishmaltesecentre.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;
Both countries are full members of the [[European Union]] and of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]].

==Migration issues==
[[File:Villa_Macedonia_-_Embassy_of_Spain_in_Malta.jpeg|thumb|right|Villa Macedonia, Cultural Centre of Hispanic-Maltese (relations) at [[Balzan]]]]
In December 2008, the two countries agreed to collaborate on issues relating to illegal migration, including repatriation. In a meeting between Home Affairs Minister [[Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici]] and his Spanish counterpart [[Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba]], they agreed that the implementation of the Immigration and Asylum Pact was a priority. The two countries agreed that a group of Spanish police should be sent to Malta in 2009 to help the Maltese force with repatriation.

==Agreements==
In January 2007, the two countries entered into a tax treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-152959338.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103011514/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-152959338.html |date=November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Municipal Park''' ({{lang-fr|parc de la Ville}}) is a public [[urban park]] in [[Luxembourg City]], in southern [[Luxembourg]].  The eastern edge flanks the ''[[boulevard du Prince Henri]]'' and, along with the valleys of the [[Alzette]] and [[Pétrusse]], forms a boundary that separates the central [[Ville Haute]] [[Quarters of Luxembourg|quarter]] from the rest of the city.

This green arc is segmented into separate sections by the ''avenue Monterey'', the ''avenue Émile Reuter'', and the ''avenue de la Porte-Neuve''.  The area bordered by these roads is approximately {{convert|20|ha|acre|0|abbr=on}}.  The southern-most section of the park is called ''Edmund Klein Park'' (Parc Ed. Klein).  The park was created after the demolition of the fortress under the 1867 [[Treaty of London (1867)|Treaty of London]].&lt;ref name="Schuman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lcto.lu/pdf/schuman_en.pdf |title=The Schuman Circular Walk |accessdate=29 November 2008 |last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=Luxembourg City Tourism Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park is the location of the [[Villa Louvigny]], in the southern-most section, and the [[Villa Vauban]], across the ''avenue Émile Reuter''.  The [[Villa Louvigny]] was the seat of the [[Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion]], the forerunner of [[RTL Group]], and hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in 1962 and 1966.  The [[Villa Vauban]] was the original seat of the [[European Court of Justice]], and is now an [[art museum]].&lt;ref name="Schuman" /&gt;

During the excavation for the construction of the underground Monterey car park, the remains of the fort was uncovered. Named the [[Lambert Redoubt]], the pentagonal fortress can now be seen just south of ''avenue Monterey''. The Lambert Fortress was originally built in 1685, renovated in 1835-6, and razed between 1868 and 1874.

RÜCKL CRYSTAL a.s. is a Bohemian [[glass factory]] situated in the village called [[Nižbor]], about 7&amp;nbsp;km west from the city of [[Beroun]], Czech Republic. The glass factory produces 24% [[lead crystal]]. Major part of its production is focused on export. Some production stays on the market in the Czech Republic.

The company was founded in 1903 by Antonín Rückl, a member of old family of glassmakers whose roots can be traced back to the 17th century. The glassworks soon became known throughout Europe, and in several countries it was also represented. [ At that time, the Rückls owned a glass factory in Včelnice and Skalice. In 1945 the glassworks was nationalized  and incorporated under Bohemian glassworks in 1965. After the revolution in 1989, the great-grandson of glassmaker Antonín Rückl, Jiří Rück privatized and founded a joint-stock company. At present, the glass factory manufactures hand-cut crystal. Most of the production is destined for foreign markets (USA, Japan, Russia), a part for the Czech market. 
The glassworks in the Czech Republic are known for producing a number of different state awards (e.g. the award of Queen Elizabeth II or John Paul II.) The glassworks can also be visited and viewed all of its production, from the mill to the cutting plant. Visitors can get acquainted with the authentic production of hand-blown and hand-cut glass.

The '''politics of Europe''' deals with the continually evolving [[politics]] within the continent of [[Europe]]. It is a topic far more detailed than other continents due to a number of factors including the long history of nation states in the region as well as the modern day trend towards increased political unity amongst the European states.

The current politics of Europe can be traced back to [[History of Europe|historical events]] within the continent. Likewise [[Geography of Europe|geography]], [[Economy of Europe|economy]] and [[Culture of Europe|culture]] have contributed to the current political make-up of Europe.

Modern European politics is dominated by the [[European Union]], since the [[revolutions of 1989|fall of the Iron Curtain]] and the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] of [[Communist state]]s. After the end of the [[Cold War]], the EU expanded eastward to include the former [[Communist countries]]. As of 2017, the EU has 28 member states.

However there are a number of other international organisations made up predominantly of European nations, or explicitly claiming a European origin, including the 47-nation Council of Europe - the first post-war European organisation, regarded as a fore-runner to the European Union - and the 57-nation Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

==Modern political climate==
Despite vastly improved relations between Russia and the Western European states since the end of the cold war, recently tensions have risen over the spread of "[[Western world|Western]]" organisations, particularly the EU and NATO, eastwards into former USSR states.

Most European states have either joined, or stated their ambition to join, the European Union.

There are few conflicts within Europe, although there remain problems in the [[Balkans]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Northern Ireland]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] in [[Spain]].

According to 2007 data published in 2008 by [[Freedom House]], the countries of Europe that cannot be classified [[Liberal democracy|liberal]] [[Electoral democracy|electoral democracies]] are [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Bosnia]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=363&amp;year=2008 freedomhouse.org: Map of Freedom in the World], 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

''European states are members of a large number of international organisations, mainly economical, although several are political, or both. The main political unions are detailed below.''

===European Union===

:''Also see: [[Politics of the European Union]], [[Enlargement of the European Union]], [[Future enlargement of the European Union]], [[Foreign relations of the European Union]], [[Eastern Partnership]]''

The [[European Union]], or EU, is a [[political union]] of 28 states. It has many activities, the most important being a common single market, consisting of a customs union, a [[euro|single currency]] (adopted by 19 of 28 member states),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/adoption/euro_area/index_en.htm|title=What is the euro area?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Common Agricultural Policy and a Common Fisheries Policy. The European Union also has various initiatives to co-ordinate activities of the member states.

The EU, considered as a unit, has the largest economy in the world with a nominal [[GDP]] of 15.849 [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] USD in 2007. There is also a trend of moving towards increased co-operation in terms of [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|common defence]] and [[foreign policy]].

The union has evolved over time from a primarily economic union to an increasingly political one. This trend is highlighted by the increasing number of policy areas that fall within EU competence; political power has tended to shift upwards from the member states to the EU. The further development of the political competencies of the EU is the subject of heavy debate within and between some member states.

===Council of Europe===
{{Main article|Council of Europe}}

The Council of Europe is the only pan-European organisation of which almost all European states are members. It is involved in a broad range of activities, including treaties and other programmes to harmonise law and regulations between its member states, in policy areas such as human rights, citizenship, [[bioethics]], mutual recognition, private international law, environmental and heritage protection, rights of minority cultural and linguistic groups, etc. It is much closer in its nature to a traditional international organisation rather than the quasi-federal entity which is the EU – it negotiates treaties which must be ratified individually, and which generally lack direct effect or individual legal access to an international court – thus it could be compared to a regional version of the United Nations. However, in the area of human rights, it has become much more quasi-federal in nature, through the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and its [[European Court of Human Rights|associated court]].

=== Community of Democratic Choice ===
{{main|Community of Democratic Choice}}
The Community of Democratic Choice (CDC) was formed in December 2005 at the primary instigation of Ukraine and Georgia, and composed of six [[Post-Soviet states]] (Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and the three [[Baltic Assembly]] members of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and three other countries of Eastern and Central Europe ([[Slovenia]], [[Romania]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]). The [[Black Sea Forum]] (BSF) is a closely related organization. Observer countries include [[Armenia]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Poland]].

Just like GUAM before it, this forum is largely seen as intending to counteract Russian influence in the area. This is the only international forum centered in the post-Soviet space in which the Baltic states also participate. The other three post-Soviet states in it are all members of GUAM.

=== Eurasian Economic Union ===
{{Main article|Eurasian Union| Enlargement of the Eurasian Economic Union}}
The [[Eurasian Economic Union]] is an [[economic union]] of post-Soviet states. The treaty aiming for the establishment of the EEU was signed on 29 May 2014 by the leaders of [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Russia]], and came into force on 1 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economy.gov.ru/wps/wcm/connect/bb840de1-a37b-4e00-8c62-6e13a59485d1/%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0+%D0%BE+%D0%95%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC+%D1%8D%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC+%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%8E%D0%B7%D0%B5.docx?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=bb840de1-a37b-4e00-8c62-6e13a59485d1 Договор о Евразийском экономическом союзе]&lt;/ref&gt; Treaties aiming for [[Armenia]]'s and [[Kyrgyzstan]]'s accession to the Eurasian Economic Union were signed on 9 October 2014 and 23 December respectively.

=== Euronest Parliamentary Assembly ===
The [[Euronest Parliamentary Assembly]] is the inter-parliamentary forum in which members of the [[European Parliament]] and the national parliaments of [[Ukraine]], [[Moldova]], [[Belarus]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] participate and forge closer political and economic ties with the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth of Independent States===
The [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) is a [[confederation]] consisting of 12 of the 15 states of the former [[Soviet Union]], (the exceptions being the three [[Baltic states]]). Although the CIS has few supranational powers, it is more than a purely symbolic organisation and possesses co-ordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking and security. The most significant issue for the CIS is the establishment of a full-fledged free trade zone and economic union between the member states, launched in 2005. It has also promoted co-operation on democratisation and cross-border crime prevention. Additionally, six members of the CIS signed on to a collective security treaty known as the [[Collective Security Treaty Organization]].

===Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations===
{{main|Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations}}
The post-Soviet [[disputed states]] of [[Abkhazia]], the [[Republic of Artsakh]], [[South Ossetia]], and [[Transnistria]] are all members of the [[Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations]] which aims to forge closer integration among the members.

===North Atlantic Treaty Organisation===
{{main|NATO|Foreign relations of NATO|Individual Partnership Action Plan|Partnership for Peace}}
The [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) is a military alliance of mainly European states, together with the [[United States of America]] and [[Canada]]. The organisation was founded as a [[collective security]] measure following [[World War II|Second World War]].

This provision was intended so that if the Soviet Union launched an attack against the European allies of the United States, it would be treated as if it were an attack on the United States itself, which had the biggest military and could thus provide the most significant retaliation. However, the feared Soviet invasion of Europe never came. Instead, the provision was invoked for the first time in the treaty's history on 12 September 2001, in response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|attacks of 11 September]] on the United States the day before.

===GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development===
[[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development]] is a regional organisation of four [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] states: [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Moldova]]. The group was created as a way of countering the influence of [[Russia]] in the area, and it has received backing and encouragement from the [[United States]] . Though at one point it was generally considered to have stagnated, recent developments have caused speculation on the possible revival of the organisation.

==Secessionist and devolutionary pressures==
{{main|List of active separatist movements in Europe}}

These movements, seeking either autonomy or independence, vary greatly in their popular support and political profile, from fringe movements to mainstream campaigns.

===Azerbaijan===
The [[Republic of Artsakh]] is an unrecognized de facto independent Republic in the [[Caucasus]] region of [[Eastern Europe]]. The [[Armenians|Armenian]] majority population declared independence from Azerbaijan in 1991 after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. It participates in the [[Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations]] along with other partially recognized states within the region.

===Belgium===
Two of Belgium's parties, the [[Vlaams Belang]] and [[New-Flemish Alliance]], want Flanders, the northern part of Belgium, to become independent. Other Flemish parties plead for more regional autonomy. There is also a minor movement aiming at unification of Flanders with the [[Netherlands]] (see [[Greater Netherlands]]).

The autonomous [[Belgium|Belgian]] region of [[Wallonia]] has a movement seeking unification with [[France]].

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Some inhabitants of [[Republika Srpska]], one of the two constituent entities in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (the other being the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), the vast majority of them being ethnic [[Serbs]], would opt for independence from Bosnia and Herzegovina and unification with [[Serbia]]. Republika Srpska comprises 49% of the territory of Bosnia and functions independently from the rest of the country in many spheres. Even though independence is not on the official government agenda, Serbian politicians from the region see a link between a possible future status of [[Kosovo]] and the status of Republika Srpska.

[[Croats]], who remain a constituent nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina remain united with ethnic [[Bosniacs]] in a joint entity. Some Bosnian Croat politicians have proposed a separate constituent entity for Croats along the lines of the Republika Srpska.

===Denmark===
The [[Denmark|Danish]] territories of [[Greenland]] and [[Faroe Islands]] have very strong independence movements. Greenland's autonomy marks it as a [[Countries of the Kingdom of Denmark|constituent country]] under the Danish kingdom.

===Finland===
The [[Åland|Åland Islands]] has an autonomy. In 2003, the [[Åland]]ian [[Separatism|separatist]] party [[Future of Åland|Ålands Framtid]] was formed. There has not been much support for full independence since the [[Finland's declaration of independence|Independence of Finland]], but in the last years the support has slightly grown.

===France===

The [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] island of [[Corsica]] has a significant and growing group calling for independence from [[France]]. There are also movements in the [[Brittany]] region of northern [[France]] who wish to regain independence lost in 1532, and in [[Savoy]] in the south east, which was annexed to France following a disputed referendum in 1860.

Parts of [[Navarre]], [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] and [[Catalonia]] cross into France.

===Georgia===
[[South Ossetia]] declared independence on 28 November 1991, and [[Abkhazia]] on 23 July 1992. Following the brief [[2008 South Ossetia war]], both entities were [[international recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|partially recognised]] as independent by several UN member states. [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] considers both "occupied territories" within its own borders. Both states participate in the [[Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations]].

===Italy===
[[Lega Nord]], a party which is especially strong in [[Veneto]] ([[Liga Veneta]]) and [[Lombardy]] ([[Lega Lombarda]]), has promoted either [[secession]] or larger [[autonomous area|autonomy]] for [[Northern Italy]] under the name [[Padania]], blaming [[Southern Italy]] for siphoning away tax funds and blocking progress. Similar groups are active in Southern Italy, but can rely on a far smaller electoral support. Plenty of autonomist and separatist parties are active in Northern regions: [[Valdostan Union]], [[South Tyrolean People's Party]], [[Die Freiheitlichen]], [[Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party]], [[North-East Union]], [[Veneto State]], etc.

In the province of [[South Tyrol]] the [[South Tyrolean Freedom]] party, which campaigned for the reunion of the province with [[Austria]], while in [[Sardinia]] the [[Independence Republic of Sardinia]] supports outright independence for the region. The Mediterranean region is home to many autonomist parties: [[Sardinian Action Party]], [[Sardinian Reformers]], [[Sardinian People's Party]], [[Sardinian Democratic Union]], [[Red Moors]], etc.

Autonomist presidents lead four out twenty regions of Italy: [[Veneto]] ([[Luca Zaia]], Liga Veneta), [[Aosta Valley]] ([[Augusto Rollandin]], Valdostan Union), [[Lombardy]] ([[Roberto Maroni]], Lega Lombarda) and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]] ([[Lorenzo Dellai]], [[Union for Trentino]]).

===Moldova===
The eastern [[Moldova]]n region of [[Transnistria]], which has a large ethnic Russian and Ukrainian population, has declared independence from Moldova on 2 September 1990 and is a member of the [[Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations]]. Despite having no control over the region, the Moldovan government refuses to recognise this claim. There is a significant movement in Moldova and [[Romania]] aiming at the [[Movement for unification of Romania and Moldova|reunification]] of the two countries.

===Netherlands===
The [[Frisian National Party]] seeks more autonomy for [[Friesland]] without striving for complete independence. The preservation of Frisian culture is an important goal of the party.

===Romania===
Before the [[Treaty of Trianon]] after [[World War I]], [[Transylvania]] belonged to [[Austria-Hungary]], and it contains minorities of ethnic Hungarians who desire autonomy in the country.

===Russia===
Several of [[Russia|Russia's]] regions have independence movements, mostly in the state's north Caucasus border. The most notable of these are [[Chechnya]], [[Dagestan]] and [[Ingushetia]], which have well supported guerrilla groups involved in open conflict with the Russian authorities.

Some [[Tatars|Tatar]] people seek independence for the region of [[Tatarstan]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===Serbia===
The province of [[Kosovo]] is the subject of a long-running political and territorial dispute between the [[Serbia]]n (and previously, the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]) government and Kosovo's largely ethnic-Albanian population. International negotiations began in 2006 to determine final status (''See [[Kosovo status process]]'').  Kosovo declared independence on 17 February 2008.

===Spain===
Within [[Spain]] there are independence movements in some of the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous regions]], notably the regions that have co-official languages such as [[Catalonia]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque country]], and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. These are mostly peaceful but some, such as [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] and [[Terra Lliure]], have used violent means.

===Ukraine===
The [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] autonomous region of [[Crimea]] has been annexed by the Russian Federation. The eastern, majority [[Russophone]] part of the country is divided, and there are calls from some groups for the area to leave Ukraine and join Russia.

'''Rosemary Anne Askin''' (born in 1949; also known as '''Rosemary Askin Cully''') is a New Zealand [[Geology|geologist]] specialising in [[Antarctic]] [[palynology]]. She was a trailblazer for women in Antarctic science, becoming the first [[New Zealand]] woman to undertake her own research programme in Antarctica in 1970.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRJtB2MNdJMC|title=Encyclopedia of the Antarctic|last=Riffenburgh|first=Beau|date=2007-01-01|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=9780415970242|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

==Career and impact==
Askin was a trailblazer for women in Antarctica. She was the first New Zealand woman to undertake her own scientific programme in Antarctica, as well as the first woman to work in a deep field setting in Antarctica,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; when in 1970 she conducted research in Victoria Land&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=-1777974906&amp;page_url=//www.wisenet-australia.org/issue76/Women%2520in%2520Antarctica.htm&amp;page_last_updated=2012-05-07T14:20:47&amp;firstName=Rosemary&amp;lastName=Askin|title=ZoomInfo Cached Page|website=www.zoominfo.com|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 21. The expedition resulted in the discovery of Antarctica’s richest-known site of fossilised fish remains. The younger rocks in this area became the basis for Askin's PhD research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GbQsYgk4UsC|title=Victoria University of Wellington, 1899–1999: A History|last=Barrowman|first=Rachel|date=1999-01-01|publisher=[[Victoria University Press]]|isbn=9780864733696|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Askin received high praise for her geological work as well as her fortitude during the 1970–71 season, with Scott Base leader Brian Porter remarking that Askin had "gained the respect and admiration of all the men of the 1970–71 New Zealand Antarctic Research Programme and set a high standard for future women who may be involved in research in Antarctica, traditionally a man's world only".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.antarctic.org.nz/pdf/Antarctic/Antarctic.V6.1.1971.pdf|title=Women Scientists|last=|first=|date=March 1971|journal=Antarctic, a News Bulleting|volume=6|number=1|pages=2–3|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Askin returned to the Antarctic numerous times between 1970 and 2001, completing expeditions to diverse parts of Antarctica including the Antarctic Peninsula, the South Shetland Islands, Victoria Land, and the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. [[Mount Askin]] in the Darwin Mountains is named after her.

Askin has researched and taught in several US universities, including The [[Ohio State University]], [[Colorado School of Mines]], and the [[University of California, Riverside]].&lt;ref name="The authors"/&gt; Askin's research interests include terrestrial palynology and the vegetational/palaeoenvironmental history of the Permian-Triassic and Cenozoic periods in Antarctica.&lt;ref name="The authors"/&gt; Among other things, her research has examined fossil pollen and spores, fossilised over 350 million to a few million years ago, to see how vegetation has changed over time. In 1982, Askin also was a member of the research team that discovered the first mammal fossils in Antarctica,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/21/us/antarctica-yields-first-land-mammal-fossil.html|title=ANTARCTICA YIELDS FIRST LAND MAMMAL FOSSIL|last=Times|first=Robert Reinhold, Special To The New York|date=1982-03-21|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she was involved in research that demonstrated that Antarctica experienced an abrupt warming cycle 15 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2010/06/abrupt-antarctica-warming-cycle-15-million-years-ago.html|title=Abrupt Antarctica Warming Cycle 15 Million Years Ago|website=The Daily Galaxy --Great Discoveries Channel|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warny|first=Sophie|last2=Askin|first2=Rosemary|last3=Hannah|first3=M.|last4=Mohr|first4=B.|last5=et. al.|first5=|date=2009|title=Palynomorphs from a sediment core reveal a sudden remarkably warm Antarctica during the middle Miocene|url=|journal=Geology|volume=37|issue=10|pages=955–958|doi=10.1130/G30139A.1|pmid=|access-date=|via=|bibcode=2009Geo....37..955W}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Askin spearheaded the establishment of the US Polar Rock Repository at the Byrd Polar Research Center, Ohio State University,&lt;ref name="The authors"/&gt; the first repository of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/rockrep.htm|title=Ohio State Rocks: Byrd Polar Center Home To National Rock Repository|website=researchnews.osu.edu|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of '''slavery in [[Vietnam]]''' persisted since the [[Hồng Bàng dynasty|Hồng Bàng period]]. Vietnam has been both a source and a destination for slaves.

==Hong Bang period==
During the [[Hồng Bàng dynasty|Hồng Bàng period]], the society was divided into three classes consisting of kings, citizens and slaves. A slave, the lowest class, served the aristocracy.

==Chinese rule==
During the [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|Chinese domination period]], Vietnamese girls were sold as sex slaves to the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Viet Nam History - Part 2 (Lịch Sử Việt Nam - phần 2) http://thuvienbao.com/books-literature/viet_history/VNHistory_2.htm http://www.vietlist.us/SUB_VietHistory/VNHistory_2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  A large trade developed where the native girls of Nam Viet were enslaved and brought north to the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer (1967), p. 56  {{Google books|yaeESYegRXMC|The Vermilion Bird|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reilly (2003), p. 59  {{Google books|E_xkU5a5Ts0C|Racism: A Global Reader|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartier (2011),  https://books.google.com/books?id=TRuqcutRvUAC&amp;pg=PT31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cpamedia.com/article.php?pg=archive&amp;acid=120510165245&amp;aiid=120601122255|title= An Intimate Affair: Vietnam's Love-Hate Relationship With China|last1= Forbes|first1= Andrew|last2= |first2= |date= |website=cpa media |publisher= cpa media|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam Past and Present: The North https://books.google.com/books?id=gKCea9iRga4C&amp;pg=PT232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schafer (1963), p. 44  {{Google books|9Z7cZ77SqEQC|The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of Tʻang Exotics|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Yue girls were sexually eroticized in Chinese literature and in poems written by Chinese who were exiled to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson (2011), p. 21  {{Google books|-GLGnRspmcAC|Ethnic Identity in Tang China|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in fact, when Chinese poets are talking about Yue, they didn't mean Vietnam. Yue is an ancient calling of [[Zhejiang]]. So, Yue Girls means girls from Zhejiang instead of Vietnam slaves.

==Dynastic era==
The Vietnamese enslaved enemy prisoners of war including the Chinese and Cham.

===Ly dynasty===
During the [[Lý dynasty]], Vietnam raided [[Song dynasty]] to enslave Chinese, who were forced to serve in the Vietnamese army as soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=-nm6UND4OLSw0QHL9ICADQ&amp;id=DIpRAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=merchants+resold#search_anchor Journal of Southeast Asian studies, Volume 37, Issue 1 (2006), p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese Buddhist Temples received Cham slaves who were prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen (1997), p. 347  {{Google books|mnLO4l5Kk64C|Zen in Medieval Vietnam: A Study and Translation of the Thiè̂n Uyẻ̂n Tập Anhpage=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Le dynasty===

After the [[Cham–Vietnamese War (1471)]] Cham prisoners were given as slaves to Vietnamese estates.&lt;ref&gt;Kiernan (2008), p. 110  {{Google books|R5p7cRyK748C|Blood and Soil: Modern Genocide 1500-2000|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were all eventually ordered to be killed due to a royal order.&lt;ref&gt;Kiernan (2008), p. 111  {{Google books|R5p7cRyK748C|Blood and Soil: Modern Genocide 1500-2000|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1995), p. 46  {{Google books|A60OggwLPrAC|Essays Into Vietnamese Pasts|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor [[Lê Thánh Tông]] was aggressive in his relations with foreign countries including China and Malacca and cracked down on foreign trade and contacts, enforcing an isolationist policy. A large amount of trade between Guangdong and Vietnam happened during his reign. Early accounts recorded that the Vietnamese captured Chinese whose ships had blown off course and detained them. Young Chinese men were selected by the Vietnamese for castration to become [[eunuch]] slaves to the Vietnamese. It has been speculated by modern historians that the Chinese who were captured and castrated by the Vietnamese were involved in trade between China and Vietnam instead of actually being blown off course by the wind and they were punished as part of a crackdown on illegal foreign trade by Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=明代广东海上丝绸之路的高度发展|url=http://eco.guoxue.com/article.php/15591/8|publisher=國學網－－中國經濟史論壇(China Economic History Forum)|date=2008-03-16|author=黄啟臣|accessdate=26 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053755/http://eco.guoxue.com/article.php/15591/8|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=明代广东海上丝绸之路的高度发展|url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/cbspub/secDetail.jsp?bookid=3222&amp;secid=3254|publisher=中國評論學術出版社(China Review Academic Publishers Unlimited)|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/cbspub/secDetail.jsp?bookid=3222&amp;secid=3257)(http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100107474&amp;mdate=0911123624&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民|url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/0/7/4/100107474.html|publisher=中國評論新聞網 (www.ChinaReviewNews.com)|accessdate= 26 July 2013 |date=2006-03-08 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;coluid=6&amp;kindid=30&amp;docid=100107474)(http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/0/7/4/100107474.html?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100107474&amp;mdate=0911123624) (http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCNML.jsp?coluid=55&amp;kindid=1160&amp;docid=100107474)(http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCNML.jsp?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100151090)(http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/5/1/0/100151090.html?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100151090&amp;mdate=0911123624)(http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100107474&amp;mdate=0911123624|)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民人文历史|url=http://life.dayoo.com/edu/200910/20/75163_11076680.htm|publisher=广州日报大洋网(www.dayoo.com)|date=2009-10-20 &lt;!-- 15:28 --&gt;|accessdate=26 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054046/http://life.dayoo.com/edu/200910/20/75163_11076680.htm|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=貿易、移殖與文化交流:15-17 世紀廣東人與越南|url=http://www.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/conference/occ/liqingxin.pdf|publisher=廣東省社會科學院歷史研究所 南開大學中國社會歷史研究中心|accessdate=5 January 2013|author=李慶新|page=12|quote=此外,沿海平民在海上航行或捕撈漁獵,遇風漂流至越南者時有發生。如成化十三年, 廣東珠池奉御陳彜奏:南海縣民遭風飄至安南被編入軍隊及被閹禁者超過 100 人。5成化中, 海南文昌人吳瑞與同鄉劉求等 13 人到欽州做生意,遇風飄至安南,當局將他們"俱發屯田, 以瑞獨少,宮之"。6...  6《明孝宗實錄》卷一百五十三,弘治十二年八月辛卯。|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JBWO91Ba?url=http://www.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/conference/occ/liqingxin.pdf|archivedate=27 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=貿易、移殖與文化交流:15-17 世紀廣東人與越南|url=http://wenku.baidu.com/view/fc9a0cdd50e2524de5187e89.html|publisher=廣東省社會科學院歷史研究所 南開大學中國社會歷史研究中心|accessdate=5 January 2013|author=李慶新|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records show that the Vietnamese performed [[castration]] in a painful procedure by removing the entire genitalia with both penis and testicles being cut off with a sharp knife or metal blade.

A 1472 entry in the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'' reported that when some Chinese from [[Nanhai District|Nanhai county]] escaped back to China after their ship had been blown off course into Vietnam, where they had been forced to serve as soldiers in Vietnam's military. The escapees also reported that they found out up to 100 Chinese men remained captives in Vietnam after they were caught and castrated by the Vietnamese after their ships were blown off course into Vietnam.

A 1499 entry in the Ming Shilu recorded that thirteen Chinese men from [[Wenchang]] including a young man named Wu Rui were captured by the Vietnamese after their ship was blown off course while traveling from [[Hainan]] to [[Guangdong]]'s Qin subprefecture ([[Qinzhou]]), after which they ended up near the coast of Vietnam, during the [[Chenghua Emperor]]'s rule (1447 - 1487) . Twelve of them were enslaved to work as agricultural laborers, while the youngest, [[Wu Rui]] (吳瑞) was selected for castration since he was the only young man and he became a eunuch attendant at the [[Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long|Vietnamese imperial palace in Thăng Long]]. After years of service, he was promoted at the death of the Vietnamese ruler in 1497 to a military position in northern Vietnam. A soldier told him of an escape route back to China and Wu Rui escaped to [[Longzhou County|Longzhou]]. The local chief planned to sell him back to the Vietnamese, but Wu was rescued by the [[Pingxiang, Guangxi|Pingxiang]] magistrate and then was sent to [[Beijing]] to work as a eunuch in the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chinese State at the Borders|year=2007|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=0774813334|url=http://www.history.ubc.ca/faculty/lshin/research/pdf/07_shin_ubcp.pdf|author=Leo K.

'''''South-African Folk-Tales''''' is a book by [[James Honeÿ]] published in 1910.  It contains forty-four [[folklore|folk tales]] from [[South Africa]] (some of which are merely different versions of the same story), mostly from the [[San people|Bushmen]], although stories of the [[Khoikhoi]] and [[Zulu people|Zulu]] are also presented.

The stories are almost entirely non-religious in nature, and focus exclusively on [[Traditional African religion|animal stories]].

'''TVTEL''' (TVTEL Comunicações, S.A.) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[digital television|digital]] satellite and cable [[Pay TV|pay television]] service provider. The satellite service started on June 26, 2007, and it was on the [[Eurobird 9]] satellite, broadcasting [[Free-to-air|FTA]] and [[Conax]]-encrypted channels for the entire Europe. It was bought by [[ZON Multimédia]] in early 2009 and subsequently closed by it by merging its operations with ZON in late 2009.

==Spor TV controversy==
Around February 2007, [[Sport TV|SportTV]] stopped broadcasting to TVTEL subscribers, causing a major outcry. SportTV justified the move by stating that TVTEL hadn't already start broadcasting exclusively with digital encryption. TVTEL later placed a caption on the channel saying "A SportTV não deixa que a TVTEL cresca, por que será?" (''SportTV doesn't allow TVTEL to grow, how come?''). It is worth mentioning that SportTV is 50% owned by former competitor (then its new owner) [[TV Cabo|ZON TVCabo]].

This controversy was somewhat similar to that of [[Virgin Media]] vs [[BSkyB]].

The '''Troubled Asset Relief Program''' ('''TARP''') is a program of the [[United States government]] to purchase [[toxic asset]]s and equity from financial institutions to strengthen its financial sector that was passed by a Democratic Party controlled Congress and signed into law by Republican Party [[U.S. President|President]] [[George W. Bush]] on October 3, 2008. It was a component of the government's measures in 2008 to address the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].

The TARP program originally authorized expenditures of $700 billion. The [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] created the TARP program. The [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], signed into law in 2010, reduced the amount authorized to $475 billion. By October 11, 2012, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) stated that total disbursements would be $431 billion, and estimated the total cost, including grants for mortgage programs that have not yet been made, would be $24 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43662 |title=CBO &amp;#124; Report on the Troubled Asset Relief Program—October 2012 |publisher=Cbo.gov |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On December 19, 2014, the [[U.S. Treasury]] sold its remaining holdings of [[Ally Financial]], essentially ending the program. TARP recovered funds totalling $441.7 billion from $426.4 billion invested, earning a $15.3 billion profit.&lt;ref name="wsj1214"&gt;{{cite news | author = RYAN TRACY,  JULIE STEINBERG and  TELIS DEMOS | title = Bank Bailouts Approach a Final Reckoning | date = December 19, 2014 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/ally-financial-exits-tarp-as-treasury-sells-remaining-stake-1419000430 | accessdate = December 28, 2014 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} | work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- this sentence is mildly biased, and it is now outdated as well:  "While it was once feared the government would be holding companies like GM, AIG and Citigroup for several years, it was reported in April 2010 that those companies are preparing to buy back the Treasury's stake and emerge from TARP within a year.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt;" --&gt;

==Purpose==
TARP allowed the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] to purchase or insure up to $700 billion of "troubled assets," defined as "(A) residential or commercial obligations will be bought, or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages, that in each case was originated or issued on or before March 14, 2008, the purchase of which the Secretary determines promotes financial market stability; and (B) any other financial instrument that the Secretary, after consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote financial market stability, but only upon transmittal of such determination, in writing, to the appropriate committees of Congress".&lt;ref name="cbo.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=9961&amp;type=1 |title=CBO &amp;#124; The Troubled Asset Relief Program: Report on Transactions Through December 31, 2008 |publisher=Cbo.gov |date=January 16, 2009 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, this allows the Treasury to purchase illiquid, difficult-to-value assets from banks and other financial institutions. The targeted assets can be [[collateralized debt obligation]]s, which were sold in a booming market until 2007, when they were hit by widespread [[foreclosure]]s on the underlying loans. TARP is intended to improve the liquidity of these assets by purchasing them using secondary market mechanisms, thus allowing participating institutions to stabilize their balance sheets and avoid further losses.

TARP does not allow banks to recoup losses already incurred on troubled assets, but officials expect that once trading of these assets resumes, their prices will stabilize and ultimately increase in value, resulting in gains to both participating banks and the Treasury itself. The concept of future gains from troubled assets comes from the hypothesis in the financial industry that these assets are oversold, as only a small percentage of all mortgages are in default, while the relative fall in prices represents losses from a much higher default rate.

The [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] (EESA) requires financial institutions selling assets to TARP to issue equity warrants (a type of security that entitles its holder to purchase shares in the company issuing the security for a specific price), or equity or senior debt securities (for non-publicly listed companies) to the Treasury. In the case of warrants, the Treasury will only receive warrants for non-voting shares, or will agree not to vote the stock. This measure is designed to protect the government by giving the Treasury the possibility of profiting through its new ownership stakes in these institutions. Ideally, if the financial institutions benefit from government assistance and recover their former strength, the government will also be able to profit from their recovery.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/issues/bailouts/eesa.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110184334/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/issues/bailouts/eesa.shtml |archivedate=January 10, 2009 |title=Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important goal of TARP is to encourage banks to resume lending again at levels seen before the crisis, both to each other and to consumers and businesses. If TARP can stabilize bank capital ratios, it should theoretically allow them to increase lending instead of hoarding cash to cushion against future unforeseen losses from troubled assets. Increased lending equates to "loosening" of credit, which the government hopes will restore order to the financial markets and improve investor confidence in financial institutions and the markets. As banks gain increased lending confidence, the interbank lending interest rates (the rates at which the banks lend to each other on a short term basis) should decrease, further facilitating lending.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

TARP will operate as a "revolving purchase facility". The Treasury will have a set spending limit, $250 billion at the start of the program, with which it will purchase the assets and then either sell them or hold the assets and collect the [[Coupon (bond)|coupons]]. The money received from sales and [[Coupon (bond)|coupons]] will go back into the pool, facilitating the purchase of more assets. The initial $250 billion can be increased to $350 billion upon the [[President of the United States|president]]'s certification to [[United States Congress|Congress]] that such an increase is necessary.&lt;ref name= 'Senate-EESA-Summary'&gt;
[https://web.archive.org/web/20081004201320/http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/latestversionEESASummary.pdf Summary of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008] United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. (Retrieved October 2, 2008)
&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining $350 billion may be released to the Treasury upon a written report to Congress from the Treasury with details of its plan for the money. Congress then has 15 days to vote to disapprove the increase before the money will be automatically released.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The first $350 billion was released on October 3, 2008, and Congress voted to approve the release of the second $350 billion on January 15, 2009. One way that TARP money is being spent is to support the "Making Homes Affordable" plan, which was implemented on March 4, 2009, using TARP money by the Department of Treasury. Because "at risk" mortgages are defined as "troubled assets" under TARP, the Treasury has the power to implement the plan. Generally, it provides refinancing for mortgages held by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; during the Federal takeover of these two enterprises, the Federal government provided a $317 billion asset relief, dwarfing the TARP bailout program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/true-cost-fannie-freddie-bailouts-317-billion-cbo-says|title=True Cost of Fannie, Freddie Bailouts: $317 Billion, CBO Says|work=CNS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privately held mortgages will be eligible for other incentives, including a favorable loan modification for five years.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of Treasury, MHA Guidelines&lt;/ref&gt;

The authority of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] to establish and manage TARP under a newly created [[Office of Financial Stability]] became law October 3, 2008, the result of an initial proposal that ultimately was passed by Congress as [[H.R. 1424]], enacting the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] and several other acts.&lt;ref name='AFP-Signed into law-2008-10-03'&gt;{{cite news|title=Economic rescue swiftly signed into law|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5h40yrrEcqeJEeVRgcrDXB7egDo2A|publisher=Google News|agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|date=October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'Slate-Gross-2008-10-01' &gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2201340/|title=How the Bailout Is Like a Hedge Fund |first= Daniel|last=Gross|date=October 1, 2008|work= Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, the British announced their [[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package|bank rescue package]] consisting of funding, debt guarantees and infusing capital into banks via preferred stock. This model was closely followed by the rest of Europe, as well as the U.S Government, who on the October 14 announced a $250bn (£143bn) [[Capital Purchase Program]] to buy stakes in a wide variety of banks in an effort to restore confidence in the sector. The money came from the $700bn Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;ref name=Langley2015&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langley|first1=Paul|title=Liquidity Lost: The Governance of the Global Financial Crisis|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199683786|pages=82–86|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FhGaBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gordon Does Good|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/opinion/13krugman.html?_r=0|accessdate=February 5, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=October 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of changes to the TARP program==
On October 14, 2008, Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Paulson]] and President Bush separately announced revisions to the TARP program. The Treasury announced their intention to buy senior preferred stock and warrants from the nine largest American banks.

To qualify for this program, the Treasury required participating institutions to meet certain criteria, including: "(1) ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution; (2) required clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings, gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate; (3) prohibition on the financial institution from making any [[golden parachute]] payment to a senior executive based on the Internal Revenue Code provision; and (4) agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of $500,000 for each senior executive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/hp1207.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014212357/http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/hp1207.htm |archivedate=October 14, 2008 |title=HP-1207: Treasury Announces TARP Capital Purchase Program Description |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Treasury also bought preferred stock and warrants from hundreds of smaller banks, using the first $250 billion allotted to the program.&lt;ref name='NYT=Landler-2008-10-14'&gt;{{cite news|first1=Mark|last1=Landler|first2=Eric|last2=Dash|title=Paulson Says Banks Must Deploy New Capital: Drama Behind a $250 Billion Banking Deal|date=October 14, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/business/economy/15bailout.html |work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first allocation of the TARP money was primarily used to buy preferred stock, which is similar to debt in that it gets paid before common equity shareholders. This has led some economists to argue that the plan may be ineffective in inducing banks to lend efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1321666|title=Common (Stock) Sense about Risk-Shifting and Bank Bailouts|publisher=SSRN.com|date=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1336288|title=Debt Overhang and Bank Bailouts|publisher=SSRN.com|date=February 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original plan presented by Paulson, the government would buy troubled (toxic) assets in insolvent banks and then sell them at auction to private investor and/or companies. This plan was scratched when Paulson met with United Kingdom's Prime Minister Gordon Brown who came to the White House for an international summit on the global credit crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703376504575492022731937884|title= Gordon Brown and Crisis Lessons Worth Learning |author= Iain Martin|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date = September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Brown, in an attempt to mitigate the credit squeeze in England, planned [[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package|a package of three measures]] consisting of funding, debt guarantees and infusing capital into banks via preferred stock.&lt;ref name=Langley2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The objective was to directly support banks' [[solvency]] and funding; in some economists' view, effectively nationalizing many banks. This plan seemed attractive to the Treasury Secretary in that it was relatively easier and seemingly boosted lending more quickly. The first half of the asset purchases may not be effective in getting banks to lend again because they were reluctant to risk lending as before with low lending standards. To make matters worse, overnight lending to other banks came to a relative halt because banks did not trust each other to be prudent with their money.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

On November 12, 2008, Paulson indicated that reviving the securitization market for consumer credit would be a new priority in the second allotment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp1265.aspx |title=Remarks by Secretary Henry M.

The previous day, on October 13, Bankers met with Treasury Secretary Paulson, along with Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve; Timothy F. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Federal Reserve Governor Kevin M. Warsh; the chairman of the FDIC, Sheila C. Bair; and the comptroller of the currency, John C. Dugan. The bankers included Kenneth D. Lewis of Bank of America, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, John J. Mack of Morgan Stanley, Vikram S. Pandit of Citigroup, Robert Kelly of Bank of New York Mellon and John A. Thain of Merrill Lynch.

Paulson demanded in the joint conference that the CEO of each bank agree to take an equity stake from the Treasury, and that they could not depart until each had signed an agreement to do so on behalf of their bank.&lt;ref name='NYT=Landler-2008-10-14'/&gt;

On December 19, 2008, President Bush used his executive authority to declare that TARP funds could be spent on any program that Paulson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21draftcnd.html | work=The New York Times | title=Text of Draft Proposal for Bailout Plan | date=September 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; deemed necessary to alleviate the financial crisis.

On December 31, 2008, the Treasury issued a report reviewing Section 102, the Troubled Assets Insurance Financing Fund, also known as the "Asset Guarantee Program".

On January 21, 2009, the Treasury announced new regulations regarding disclosure and mitigation of conflicts of interest in its TARP contracting.&lt;ref&gt;[TARP Conflicts of Interest, Interim Rule, 74 Fed. Reg. 3431-3436 TARP Conflicts of Interest, Interim Rule, 74 Fed. Reg. 3431-3436]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2009, the Senate approved changes to the TARP that prohibited firms receiving TARP funds from paying bonuses to their 25 highest-paid employees. The measure was proposed by [[Christopher Dodd]] of Connecticut as an amendment to the $900 billion economic stimulus act then waiting to be passed.&lt;ref name='Reuters-2009-02-05'&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 2009, the newly confirmed Secretary of the Treasury [[Timothy Geithner]] outlined his plan to use the remaining $300 billion or so in TARP funds. He intended to direct $50 billion towards foreclosure mitigation and use the rest to help fund private investors to buy toxic assets from banks. Nevertheless, this highly anticipated speech coincided with a nearly 5 percent drop in the S&amp;P 500 and was criticized for lacking details.&lt;ref name='Deborah Solomon'&gt;{{cite news | title= Market Pans Bank Rescue Plan | date= February 11, 2009 | work= The Wall Street Journal | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123427167262568141 | accessdate =February 12, 2009 | first=Deborah | last=Solomon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2009, Geithner announced a [[Public-Private Investment Program]] (P-PIP) to buy [[toxic assets]] from banks' balance sheets. The major stock market indexes in the United States rallied on the day of the announcement rising by over six percent with the shares of bank stocks leading the way.&lt;ref name='Edmund L. Andrews and Eric Dash'&gt;{{cite news | title= U.S. Expands Plan to Buy Banks' Troubled Assets | date= March 24, 2009 | work= The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/business/economy/24bailout.html | accessdate =February 12, 2009 | first1=Edmund L. | last1=Andrews | first2=Eric | last2=Dash}}&lt;/ref&gt; P-PIP has two primary programs. The Legacy Loans Program will attempt to buy residential loans from bank's balance sheets. The [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) will provide non-recourse loan guarantees for up to 85 percent of the purchase price of legacy loans. Private sector asset managers and the U.S. Treasury will provide the remaining assets. The second program is called the legacy securities program, which will buy [[Residential mortgage-backed security|residential mortgage backed securities]] (RMBS) that were originally rated AAA and [[Commercial mortgage-backed security|commercial mortgage-backed securities]] (CMBS) and [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] (ABS) which are rated AAA. The funds will come in many instances in equal parts from the U.S. Treasury's TARP monies, private investors, and from loans from the Federal Reserve's [[Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility]] (TALF). The initial size of the Public Private Investment Partnership is projected to be $500 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/ppip_fact_sheet.pdf |title=FACT SHEET PUBLIC-PRIVATE INVESTMENT PROGRAM|publisher=U.S. Treasury |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 26, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324012024/http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/ppip_fact_sheet.pdf|archivedate=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist and Nobel Prize winner [[Paul Krugman]] has been very critical of this program arguing the non-recourse loans lead to a hidden subsidy that will be split by asset managers, banks' shareholders and creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Paul | last = Krugman | url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/23/geithner-plan-arithmetic/ |title=Geithner plan arithmetic|work=The New York Times |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banking analyst [[Meredith Whitney]] argues that banks will not sell bad assets at fair market values because they are reluctant to take asset write downs.&lt;ref name='John Carney'&gt;

==Administrative structure==
{{See also|Oversight of the Troubled Asset Relief Program}}
The program is run by the Treasury's new [[Office of Financial Stability]]. According to a speech made by [[Neel Kashkari]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accountability-central.com/single-view-default/article/treasury-update-on-implementation-of-troubled-asset-relief-program-tarp-before-institute-of-intern/?tx_ttnewsbackPid=1&amp;cHash=8702938e7e |title=Treasury Update on Implementation of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) before Institute of International |publisher=Accountability-central.com |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fund will be split into the following administrative units:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
#[[Mortgage-backed securities]] purchase program: This team is identifying which troubled assets to purchase, from whom to buy them and which purchase mechanism will best meet our policy objectives. Here, we are designing the detailed auction protocols and will work with vendors to implement the program.
#Whole loan purchase program: Regional banks are particularly clogged with whole residential mortgage loans. This team is working with bank regulators to identify which types of loans to purchase first, how to value them, and which purchase mechanism will best meet our policy objectives.
#Insurance program: We are establishing a program to insure troubled assets. We have several innovative ideas on how to structure this program, including how to insure mortgage-backed securities as well as whole loans. At the same time, we recognize that there are likely other good ideas out there that we could benefit from. Accordingly, on Friday we submitted to the Federal Register a public Request for Comment to solicit the best ideas on structuring options. We are requiring responses within fourteen days so we can consider them quickly, and begin designing the program.
#[[Stock|Equity]] purchase program: We are designing a standardized program to purchase equity in a broad array of financial institutions. As with the other programs, the equity purchase program will be voluntary and designed with attractive terms to encourage participation from healthy institutions. It will also encourage firms to raise new private capital to complement public capital.
#Homeownership preservation: When we purchase mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, we will look for every opportunity possible to help homeowners. This goal is consistent with other programs – such as HOPE NOW – aimed at working with borrowers, counselors and servicers to keep people in their homes. In this case, we are working with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to maximize these opportunities to help as many homeowners as possible, while also protecting the government.
#[[Executive compensation]]: The law sets out important requirements regarding executive compensation for firms that participate in the TARP. This team is working hard to define the requirements for financial institutions to participate in three possible scenarios: One, an auction purchase of troubled assets; two, a broad equity or direct purchase program; and three, a case of an intervention to prevent the impending failure of a systemically significant institution.
#[[Regulatory compliance|Compliance]]: The law establishes important oversight and compliance structures, including establishing an Oversight Board, on-site participation of the General Accounting Office and the creation of a Special Inspector General, with thorough reporting requirements.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Eric Thorson]] is the [[Inspector General]] of the [[US Department of the Treasury]] and currently is responsible for the oversight of the TARP but has expressed concerns about the difficulty of properly overseeing the complex program in addition to his regular responsibilities. Thorson called oversight of TARP a "mess" and later clarified this to say "The word 'mess' was a description of the difficulty my office would have in providing the proper level of oversight of the TARP while handling its growing workload, including conducting audits of certain failed banks and thrifts at the same time that efforts are underway to nominate a special inspector general."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Thorson. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/20/AR2008112003484.html "Workload, Not TARP, Is a 'Mess'"]. ''The Washington Post''. November 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2008|November}}, [[Neil Barofsky]] was nominated as the Special Treasury Department Inspector General with the express role of overseeing the TARP. Barofsky is undergoing senate confirmation hearings from the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]].

The Treasury retained the [[law firms]] of [[Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey]] and [[Hughes, Hubbard &amp; Reed]] to assist in the administration of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Rucker| first = Patrick| title = Two law firms to help U.S. Treasury dole out aid| publisher = Reuters| date = November 3, 2008| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN0335583020081103 | accessdate =November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounting and internal controls support services have been contracted from [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] and [[Ernst and Young]] under the Federal Supply Schedule.&lt;ref&gt;US Government Accountability Office Report GAO-09-161: Troubled Asset Relief Program: Additional Actions Needed to Better Ensure Integrity, Accountability, and Transparency. December 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation criteria==
The Act's criterion for participation states that "financial institutions" will be included in TARP if they are "established and regulated" under the laws of the United States and if they have "significant operations" in the United States. The Treasury will need to define what institutions will be included under the term "financial institution" and what will constitute "significant operations".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Companies that sell their bad assets to the government must provide [[Warrant (finance)|warrant]]s so that the government will benefit from future growth of the companies.&lt;ref name='Senate-EESA-Summary'/&gt; Certain institutions seem to be guaranteed participation. These include: U.S. banks, U.S. branches of a foreign bank, U.S. savings banks or credit unions, U.S. broker-dealers, U.S. insurance companies, U.S. mutual funds or other U.S. registered investment companies, tax-qualified U.S. employee retirement plans, and bank holding companies.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The President is to submit a law to cover government losses on the fund, using "a small, broad-based fee on all financial institutions".&lt;ref name='Senate-EESA-Summary'/&gt; To participate in the bailout program, "...companies will lose certain tax benefits and, in some cases, must limit [[executive pay]]. In addition, the bill limits '[[golden parachute]]s' and requires that unearned bonuses be returned."&lt;ref name='Senate-EESA-Summary'/&gt; The fund has an Oversight Board so that the [[U.S. Treasury]] cannot act in an arbitrary manner. There is also an [[inspector general]] to protect against waste, fraud and abuse.&lt;ref name='Senate-EESA-Summary'/&gt;

[[CAMELS ratings]] (US supervisory ratings used to classify the nation's 8,500 banks) are being used by the [[United States]] government in response to the [[global financial crisis of 2008]] to help it decide which banks to provide special help for and which to not as part of its capitalization program authorized by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. It is being used to classify the nation's 8,500 banks into five categories, where a ranking of 1 means they are most likely to be helped and a 5 most likely to not be helped. Regulators are applying a short list of criteria based on a secret ratings system they use to gauge this.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Eric Dash. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/01/business/01bank.html "U.S. Said to Be Using Loose Rules in Bank Aid"]. ''The New York Times''. October 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' states: "The criteria being used to choose who gets money appears to be setting the stage for consolidation in the industry by favoring those most likely to survive" because the criteria appears to favor the financially best off banks and banks [[Too-big-to-fail|too big to let fail]]. Some lawmakers are upset that the capitalization program will end up culling banks in their districts.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; However, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' suggested that some lawmakers are actively using TARP to funnel money to weak regional banks in their districts.&lt;ref&gt;Paletta, Damian; Enrich, David. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123258284337504295 "Political Interference Seen in Bank Bailout Decisions"]. ''The Wall Street Journal''. January 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic studies have found that banks and credit unions located in the districts of key Congress members have been more likely to win TARP money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1698945 |title=Political Influence and TARP Investments in Credit Unions by Elisabeta Pana, Linus Wilson |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1698945 |publisher=SSRN |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1698945 |title=Political Influence and TARP Investments in Credit Unions by Elisabeta Pana, Linus Wilson :: SSRN |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1698945 |accessdate=November 4, 2013 |journal=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known aspects of the capitalization program "suggest that the government may be loosely defining what constitutes healthy institutions. [... Banks] that have been profitable over the last year are the most likely to receive capital. Banks that have lost money over the last year, however, must pass additional tests. [...] They are also asking if a bank has enough capital and reserves to withstand severe losses to its construction loan portfolio, nonperforming loans and other troubled assets."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Some banks received capital with the understanding the banks would try to find a merger partner. To receive capital under the program banks are also "required to provide a specific business plan for the next two or three years and explain how they plan to deploy the capital".&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Eligible assets and asset valuation==
TARP allows the Treasury to purchase both "troubled assets" and any other asset the purchase of which the Treasury determines is "necessary" to further economic stability. Troubled assets include real estate and mortgage-related assets and securities based on those assets. This includes both the mortgages themselves and the various financial instruments created by pooling groups of mortgages into one security to be bought on the market. This category probably includes foreclosed properties as well.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Real estate and mortgage-related assets (and securities based on those kinds of assets) are eligible if they originated (that is, were created) or were issued on or before March 14, 2008, the date of the Bear Stearns bailout.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

One of the most difficult issues facing the Treasury in managing TARP is the pricing of the troubled assets. The Treasury must find a way to price extremely complex and sometimes unwieldy instruments for which a market does not exist. In addition, the pricing must strike a balance between efficiently using public funds provided by the government and providing adequate assistance to the financial institutions that need it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The Act encourages the Treasury to design a program using market mechanisms to the extent possible. This has led to the expectation that the Treasury will use a "reverse auction" mechanism to price assets. A reverse auction means that bidders (that is, the potential sellers of the troubled assets) will place bids with the Treasury for the right to sell a specified type of assets. The sale price will be the lowest price at which the bid will provide the required quantity of the item. Theoretically, the system creates a market price because the bidders will want to sell at the highest price they can get, but they also want to be able to make a sale, so they must set a low enough price to be competitive. The Treasury is required to publish its methods for pricing, purchasing, and valuing troubled assets no later than two days after the purchase of their first asset.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) uses procedures similar to those specified in the Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA) to value assets purchased under the TARP.&lt;ref name="cbo.gov"/&gt;

In a report dated February 6, 2009, the Congressional Oversight Panel concluded that the Treasury paid substantially more for the assets it purchased under the TARP than their then-current market value. The COP found the Treasury paid $254 billion, for which it received assets worth approximately $176 billion, for a shortfall of $78 billion. The COP's valuation analysis assumed that "securities similar to those issued under the TARP were trading in the capital markets at fair values" and employed multiple approaches to cross-check and validate the results. The value was estimated for each security as of the time immediately following the announcement by Treasury of its purchase. For example, the COP found that the Treasury bought $25 billion of assets from Citigroup on October 14, 2008, however, the actual value was estimated to be $15.5, creating a 38 percent (or $9.5 billion) subsidy.&lt;ref name="cop.senate.gov"/&gt;

==Protection of government investment==
#'''Equity stakes'''
##The Act requires financial institutions selling assets to TARP to issue equity warrants (a type of security that entitles its holder to purchase shares in the company issuing the security for a specific price), or equity or senior debt securities (for non-publicly listed companies) to the Treasury. In the case of warrants, the Treasury will only receive warrants for non-voting shares, or will agree not to vote the stock. This measure is designed to protect the government by giving the Treasury the possibility of profiting through its new ownership stakes in these institutions. Ideally, if the financial institutions benefit from government assistance and recover their former strength, the government will also be able to profit from their recovery.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
#'''Limits on executive compensation'''
##The Act sets some limits on the compensation of the five highest-paid executives at companies that elect to participate significantly in TARP. The Act treats companies that participate through the auction process differently from those that participate through direct sale (that is, without a bidding process).
###'''Companies who sell more than $300 million in assets through an auction process''' are prohibited from signing new "golden parachute" contracts (employment contracts that provide for large payments upon termination) with any future executives. It will also place a $500,000 limit on annual tax deductions for payment of each executive, as well as a deduction limit on severance benefits for any golden parachutes already in place.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
###'''Companies in which the Treasury acquires equity because of direct purchases''' must meet tougher standards to be established by the Treasury. These standards will require the companies to eliminate compensation structures that encourage "unnecessary and excessive" risk-taking by executives, provide for claw-back (forced repayment of bonuses in the event of a post-payment determination that the bonuses were paid on the basis of false data) of bonuses already paid to senior executives based on financial statements later proven to be inaccurate, and prohibit payment of previously established golden parachutes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
#'''Recoupment'''
##This provision was a big factor in the eventual passage of the EESA. It gives the government the opportunity to "be repaid". The recoupment provision requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to submit a report on TARP's financial status to Congress five years after its enactment. If TARP has not been able to recoup its outlays through the sale of the assets, the Act requires the President to submit a plan to Congress to recoup the losses from the financial industry. Theoretically, this prevents TARP from adding to the national debt. The use of the term "financial industry" in the provision leaves open the possibility that such a plan would involve the entire financial sector rather than only those institutions that availed themselves of TARP.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
#'''Disclosure and Transparency'''
##Though the Treasury will ultimately determine the type and extent of disclosure required for participation in the TARP, it is clear that these requirements will be extensive, particularly with respect to any asset acquired by TARP. It seems certain that institutions who participate in TARP will have to publicly disclose information pertaining to their participation, including the number of assets they sold to TARP, what type of assets were sold, and at what price. More extensive disclosure may be required at the discretion of the Treasury.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
##The Act also seems to give a broad mandate to the Treasury to determine, for each "type" of institution that sells assets to TARP, whether the current disclosure and transparency requirements on the sources of the institution's exposure (such as off-balance sheet transactions, derivative instruments, and contingent liabilities) are adequate. If the Treasury finds that a particular institution has not provided sufficient disclosures, it has the power to make recommendations for new disclosure requirements to the institution's regulators, which will probably include foreign-government regulators for those foreign financial institutions that have "significant operations" in the United States.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
#'''Judicial Review of Treasury Actions'''
##The Act provides for judicial review of the actions taken by the Treasury under the EESA. In other words, the Treasury may be taken to court for actions it takes pursuant to the Act. Specifically, Treasury actions may be held unlawful if they involve an abuse of discretion, or are found to be "arbitrary, capricious . . . or not in accordance with law". However, a financial institution that sells assets to TARP is cannot challenge the Treasury's actions with respect to that institution's specific participation in TARP.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Expenditures and commitments==
{{As of|2012|June|30|df=US}}, $467 billion had been allotted, and $416 billion spent, according to a literature review on the TARP.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Linus, TARP (October 19, 2012). New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics Online, Forthcoming. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2164559&lt;/ref&gt; Among the money committed, includes:

* $204.9 billion to purchase bank equity shares through the [[Capital Purchase Program]]
* $67.8 billion to purchase preferred shares of [[American International Group]] (AIG), then among the top 10 US companies, through the program for Systemically Significant Failing Institutions;
* $1.4 billion to back any losses that the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] might incur under the [[Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility]];
* $40 billion in stock purchases of Citigroup and Bank of America ($20 billion each) through the Targeted Investment Program ($40 billion spent).  All that money had been returned.
* $5 billion in loan guarantees for Citigroup ($5 billion).  The program closed, with no payment made, on December 23, 2009.
* $79.7 billion in loans and capital injections to automakers and their financing arms through the Automotive Industry Financing Program.
* $21.9 billion to buy "toxic" mortgage-related securities.
* $0.6 billion in capital for banks in [[Community Development Capital Initiative]] (CDCI) for banks serving disadvantaged communities.
* $45.6 billion for homeowner foreclosure assistance.  Only $4.5 billion had been spent at the time.

The Congressional Budget Office released a report in January 2009, reviewing the transactions enacted through the TARP. The CBO found that through December 31, 2008, transactions under the TARP totaled $247 billion. According to the CBO's report, the Treasury had purchased $178 billion in shares of preferred stock and warrants from 214 U.S. financial institutions through its Capital Purchase Program (CPP). This included the purchase of $40 billion of preferred stock in AIG, $25 billion of preferred stock in Citigroup, and $15 billion of preferred stock in Bank of America. The Treasury also agreed to lend $18.4 billion to General Motors and Chrysler. The Treasury, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve have also agreed to guarantee a $306 billion portfolio of assets owned by Citigroup.&lt;ref name="cbo.gov"/&gt;

The CBO also estimated the subsidy cost for transactions under TARP. The subsidy cost is defined as, broadly speaking, the difference between what the Treasury paid for the investments or lent to the firms and the market value of those transactions, where the assets in question were valued using procedures similar to those specified in the Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA), but adjusting for market risk as specified in the EESA.&lt;ref name="cbo.gov"/&gt; The CBO estimated that the subsidy cost of the $247 billion in transactions before December 31, 2008 amounts to $64 billion. As of August 31, 2015, TARP is projected to cost approximately $37.3 billion total - significantly less than the $700 billion originally authorized by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/about-tarp/Pages/default.aspx|title=About TARP|author=|date=|website=www.treasury.gov|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The May 2015 report of the TARP to Congress stated that $427.1 billion had been disbursed, total proceeds by April 30, 2015 were $441.8 billion, exceeding disbursements by $14.1 billion, though this included $17.7 billion in non-TARP AIG shares.   The report predicted a total net cash outflow of $37.7 billion (excluding non-TARP AIG shares), based on the assumption the TARP housing programs' ([[Hardest Hit Fund]], [[Making Home Affordable]] and FHA refinancing) funds are fully taken up.  Debt is still outstanding, some of which has been converted to common stock, from just under $125 million down to $7000.  Sums loaned to entities that have gone into, and in some cases emerged from  bankruptcy or receivership are provided.  Additional sums have been written off, for example Treasury's original investment of $854 million in Old GM.&lt;ref name="May 2015 cong"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Documents/April%202015%20Monthly%20Report%20to%20Congress.pdf|title=Report to Congress May 2015|author=TARP|date=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The May 2015 report also detailed other costs of the program, including $1.157 billion "for financial agents and legal firms" $142 million for personnel services, and $303 million for "other services".&lt;ref name="May 2015 cong" /&gt;

Of these banks, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Morgan Stanley, American Express Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., U.S. Bancorp, Capital One Financial Corp., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., State Street Corp., BB&amp;T Corp, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Bank of America repaid TARP money. Most banks repaid TARP funds using capital raised from the issuance of equity securities and debt not guaranteed by the federal government. PNC Financial Services, one of the few profitable banks without TARP money, planned on paying their share back by January 2011, by building up its cash reserves instead of issuing equity securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09296/1007676-28.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=PNC quarterly profits more than double | first=Patricia | last=Sabatini | date=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, PNC reversed course on February 2, 2010, by issuing $3 billion in shares and $1.5-2 billion in senior notes in order to pay its TARP funds back. PNC also raised funds by selling its Global Investment Services division to crosstown rival [[The Bank of New York Mellon]].&lt;ref name="PNC" /&gt;

In a January 2012, review, it was reported that AIG still owed around $50 billion, GM about $25 billion and Ally about $12 billion. Break even on the first two companies would be at $28.73 a share versus then-current share price of $25.31 and $53.98 versus then-current share price of $24.92, respectively. Ally was not publicly traded. The 371 banks that still owed money include Regions ($3.5 billion), [[Zions Bancorporation]] ($1.4 billion), [[Synovus|Synovus Financial Corp.]] ($967.9 million), [[Popular, Inc.]] ($935 million), [[First BanCorp]] of San Juan, Puerto Rico ($400 million) and [[M&amp;T Bank Corp.]] ($381.5 million).&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Marcy, [http://www.ajc.com/business/report-taxpayers-still-owed-1317741.html "Report: Taxpayers still owed $133B from bailout"], [[Associated Press]] via ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', January 26, 2012.

==TARP fraud==
To date, some in the financial industry have been accused of not using the loaned dollars for its intended reason. Others further abused investors after the TARP legislation was passed by telling investors their money was invested in the federal TARP financial bailout program and other securities that did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Duthel, Heinz. European Debt Crisis 2011. Euro Group Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain , and Belgium, 2010. book.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neil Barofsky, Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP), told lawmakers, "Inadequate oversight and insufficient information about what companies are doing with the money leaves the program open to fraud, including conflicts of interest facing fund managers, collusion between participants and vulnerabilities to money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stein |first=Mark |url=http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/daily-brief/2009/04/21/tarp-fraud-probes-begin/ |title=Tarp Fraud Probes Begin - Daily Brief |publisher=Portfolio.com |date=April 21, 2009 |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its October 2011 quarterly report to Congress, SIGTARP reported "more than 150 ongoing criminal and civil investigations". SIGTARP had already achieved criminal convictions of 28 defendants (19 had already been sentenced to prison), and civil cases naming 37 individuals and 18 corporate/legal entities as defendants. It had recovered $151 million, and prevented $553 million going to [[Colonial Bank (United States)|Colonial Bank]], which failed.&lt;ref name="sigtarp.gov october report"&gt;{{cite web|title=SIGTARP Quarterly Report to Congress|url=http://www.sigtarp.gov/reports/congress/2011/October2011_Quarterly_Report_to_Congress.pdf|date=October 27, 2011|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first TARP fraud case was brought by the SEC on January 19, 2009, against Nashville-based Gordon Grigg and his firm ProTrust Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/markets/2009-01-28-sec-tarp-fraud_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=SEC charges financial planner with TARP fraud | date=January 28, 2009 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest occurred in March 2010, with the FBI claiming Charles Antonucci, the former president and chief executive of the Park Avenue Bank, made false statements to regulators in an effort to obtain about $11 million from the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703909804575123672347495854 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Bank Chief Accused of TARP Fraud | first1=Lingling | last1=Wei | first2=Chad | last2=Bray | date=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar historical federal banking programs==
The nearest parallel action the federal government has taken was in investments made by the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) in the 1930s. The RFC, an agency chartered during the [[Herbert Hoover]] administration in 1932, made loans to distressed banks and bought stock in 6,000 banks, totalling $1.3 billion. ''The New York Times,'' citing finance experts on October 13, 2008, noted that, "A similar effort these days, in proportion to today's economy, would be about $200 billion." When the economy had stabilized, the government sold its bank stock to private investors or the banks, and is estimated to have received approximately the same amount previously invested.&lt;ref name='NYT-Lohr-2008-10-13'&gt;
{{cite news | first= Steve | last= Lohr | title= Intervention Is Bold, but Has a Basis in History | date= October 13, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/14/business/economy/14nationalize.html | work = The New York Times| pages = | accessdate =October 15, 2008 }} The article relies on the work of New York University Historian and Economist [[Richard Sylla]] for historical estimates.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the government took an 80 percent stake in the nation's then seventh-largest bank [[Continental Illinois]] Bank and Trust. Continental Illinois made loans to oil drillers and service companies in Oklahoma and Texas. The government was estimated to have lost $1 billion because of Continental Illinois, which ultimately became part of [[Bank of America]].&lt;ref name='NYT-Lohr-2008-10-13'/&gt;

The $24 billion for the estimated subsidy cost of TARP was less than the government's cost for the [[savings and loan crisis]] of the late 1980s, although the subsidy cost does not include the cost of other "bailout" programs (such as the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]]'s [[Maiden Lane Transactions]] and the [[Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac]]). The cost of the S&amp;L crisis amounted to 3.2 percent of GDP during the Reagan/Bush era, while the GDP percentage of the TARP cost was estimated at less than 1 percent.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;Deborah Solomon. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304846504575177950029886696 "Light At the End of the Bailout Tunnel"]. ''The Wall Street Journal''.

==Controversies==
{{See also|AIG bonus payments controversy|Indiana State Police Pension Trust v. Chrysler|National City acquisition by PNC}}

The primary purpose of TARP, according to the Federal Reserve, was to stabilize the financial sector by purchasing illiquid assets from banks and other financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernanke|first=Ben|date=October 7, 2008|accessdate=April 11, 2013|title=Current Economic and Financial Conditions|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20081007a.htm|work=[[Federal Reserve]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the effects of the TARP have been widely debated in large part because the purpose of the fund is not widely understood.   A review of investor presentations and conference calls by executives of some two dozen US-based banks by [[The New York Times]] found that "few [banks] cited lending as a priority. Further, an overwhelming majority saw the program as a no-strings-attached windfall that could be used to pay down debt, acquire other businesses or invest for the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Mike| last= McIntire | title= Bailout Is a Windfall to Banks, if Not to Borrowers.| date= January 17, 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/18/business/18bank.html | work = The New York Times | accessdate =January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article cited several bank chairmen as stating that they viewed the money as available for strategic acquisitions in the future rather than to increase lending to the private sector, whose ability to pay back the loans was suspect. PlainsCapital chairman Alan B. White saw the Bush administration's cash infusion as "opportunity capital," noting, "They didn't tell me I had to do anything particular with it."

Moreover, while TARP funds have been provided to bank holding companies, those holding companies have only used a fraction of such funds to recapitalize their bank subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Coates | first = John C. | first2 = David S. | last2 = Scharfstein | date = February 17, 2009 | accessdate = February 19, 2009 | title = Op-Ed: The Bailout Is Robbing the Banks | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/opinion/18scharfstein.html | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many analysts speculated TARP funds could be used by stronger banks to buy weaker ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiercefinance.com/story/how-can-banks-best-use-tarp-funds/2008-10-31 |title=How can banks best use TARP funds? |publisher=FierceFinance |date=October 31, 2008 |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124235856/http://fiercefinance.com/story/how-can-banks-best-use-tarp-funds/2008-10-31 |archivedate=January 24, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 24, 2008, [[PNC Financial Services]] received $7.7 billion in TARP funds, then only hours later agreed to buy [[National City Corp.]] for $5.58 billion, an amount that was considered a bargain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kdka.com/business/PNC.Financial.Services.2.847872.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025073649/http://kdka.com/business/PNC.Financial.Services.2.847872.html |archivedate=October 25, 2008 |title=kdka.com - PNC Financial Services To Buy National City |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=October 24, 2008 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite ongoing speculation that more TARP funds could be used by large-but-weak banks to gobble up small banks, as of October 2009, no further such takeover had occurred.

The Senate Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the TARP concluded on January 9, 2009: "In particular, the Panel sees no evidence that the [[U.S. Treasury]] has used TARP funds to support the housing market by avoiding preventable foreclosures." The panel also concluded that "Although half the money has not yet been received by the banks, hundreds of billions of dollars have been injected into the marketplace with no demonstrable effects on lending."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cop.senate.gov/documents/cop-010909-report.pdf |title=Accountability for the Troubled Asset Relief Program |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=November 4, 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106141711/http://cop.senate.gov/documents/cop-010909-report.pdf |archivedate=January 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government officials overseeing the bailout have acknowledged difficulties in tracking the money and in measuring the bailout's effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2009-01-01/news/28412357_1_bailout-program-bailout-money-rotten-assets | work=The Times Of India | title=US officials say tracking bailout money is difficult | date=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2008, companies that received $295 billion in bailout money had spent $114 million on lobbying and campaign contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE51377B20090204?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews |title=U.S. bailout recipients spent $114 million on politics |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=November 4, 2013 |first=Andy |last=Sullivan |date=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks that received bailout money had compensated their top executives nearly $1.6 billion in 2007, including salaries, cash bonuses, stock options, and benefits including personal use of company jets and chauffeurs, home security, country club memberships, and professional money management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=6504932 |title=Business News, Personal Finance and Money News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Obama administration has promised to set a $500,000 cap on executive pay at companies that receive bailout money,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/business/04pay.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Edmund L. | last1=Andrews | first2=Vikas | last2=Bajaj | title=U.S. Plans $500,000 Cap on Executive Pay in Bailouts | date=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; directing banks to tie risk taken to workers' reward by paying anything further in deferred stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/13/AR2009021303288.html |title=Congress Limits CEO Bonuses |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |accessdate=November 4, 2013 |date=February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graef Crystal]], a former compensation consultant and author of "The Crystal Report on Executive Compensation," claimed that the limits on executive pay were "a joke" and that "they're just allowing companies to defer compensation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&amp;sid=azVLk.22AkLI |title=News |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, a report showed that the sum of the government's guarantees increased to $7.77 trillion; however, loans to banks were only a small fraction of that amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ivry |first=Bob |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/secret-fed-loans-undisclosed-to-congress-gave-banks-13-billion-in-income.html |title=Secret Fed Loans Gave Banks $13 Billion Undisclosed to Congress |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that the typical white-owned bank was about ten times more likely to receive TARP money in the CDCI program than a black-owned bank after controlling for other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2247043 |title=Minority Ownership and TARP Investments by Lucas Puente, Linus Wilson |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2247043 |publisher=SSRN |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Bankers Association's attempts to expunge the TARP warrants==
By March 31, 2009, four banks out of over five hundred had returned their [[preferred stock]] obligations. None of the publicly traded banks had yet bought back their warrants owned by the U.S. Treasury by March 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sigtarp.gov/Audit%20Reports/Assessing%20Treasury's%20Process%20to%20Sell%20Warrants%20Received%20From%20TARP%20Recipients_May_11_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the terms of the U.S. Treasury's investment, the banks returning funds can either negotiate to buy back the warrants at fair market value, or the U.S. Treasury can sell the warrants to third party investors as soon as feasible. Warrants are [[call option]]s that add to the number of shares of stock outstanding if they are exercised for a profit. The [[American Bankers Association]] (ABA) has lobbied Congress to cancel the warrants owned by the government, calling them an "onerous exit fee".&lt;ref&gt;Damian Paletta; Deborah Solomon. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124035639380840961 "Financial Firms Lobby to Cut Cost of TARP Exit"]. ''The Wall Street Journal''. April 22, 2009.
