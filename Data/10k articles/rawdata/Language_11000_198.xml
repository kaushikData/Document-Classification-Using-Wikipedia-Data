The '''acholia''' is the lack or absence of bile secretion.&lt;ref&gt;Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers. Saunders; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be referred to as hypocholia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dieulafoy|first1=Georges|title=A Text-book of Medicine|date=1912|publisher=D.

'''Acholia''' is an uncommon trouble of the biliary function in the liver; bile flow dissipates.&lt;ref name="medecine"&gt;La médecine de A à Z. Hachette; 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[Ancient Greek]]: ''a'' + ''chole'' (without bile).

== Cause ==
A condition in which little or no bile is secreted or the flow of bile into the digestive tract is obstructed. The acholia is a sign of many diseases, such as [[hepatitis]].
Acholia results of a fading of feces.&lt;ref name="medecine" /&gt;

'''Age of Acquisition''' is a [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] variable referring to the age at which a [[word]] is typically learned. For example, the word '[[penguin]]' is typically learned at a younger age than the word '[[Albatross|albatros]]'. Studies in [[psycholinguistics]] suggest that age of acquisition has an effect on the [[speed]] of reading words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=2005-11504-006|title=Age-of-Acquisition Effects in Word and Picture Identification}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a particularly strong variable in predicting the speed of [[Image|picture]] naming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aphasia and age of acquisition: are early-learned words more resilient? | doi=10.1080/02687038.2015.1106439 | volume=30|issue = 11|journal=Aphasiology|pages=1240–1263 | last1 = Brysbaert | first1 = Marc|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been generally found that words that are more frequent, shorter, more familiar and refer to concrete concepts are learned earlier than more complex words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coglab.cengage.com/labs/age_of_acquisition.shtml|title=CogLab: Age of Acquisition|website=coglab.cengage.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norms==
Sets of normative values for age of acquisition for large sets of words have been developed.

==Relation to other variables==
It has been disputed whether age of acquisition has an effect on word tasks on its own or by virtue of its [[covariance]] with other variables such as [[Word frequency effect|word frequency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=2005-11504-006|title=Age-of-Acquisition Effects in Word and Picture Identification}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it has been suggested that the age of acquisition is related to the fact that an earlier learned word has been encountered more often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psych.cf.ac.uk/home2/lewis/13%20Lewis_Reevaluating%20AoA%20effects%20(Cognition%202001).pdf|title=Re-evaluating age-of-acquisition effects: are they simply cumulative-frequency effects?}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues were partially resolved in an article by Ghyselinck, Lewis and Brysbaert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691803001070|title=Age of acquisition and the cumulative-frequency hypothesis: A review of the literature and a new multi-task investigation | doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2003.11.002 |pmid=14734241 | volume=115|issue=1 |journal=Acta Psychologica|pages=43–67 | last1 = Ghyselinck | first1 = Mandy|date=January 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively there have been discussions of the effect that the age of acquisition has on learning a second language.

==Etymology==
Allopathic medicine and allopathy (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] prefix ''ἄλλος'', ''állos'', "other", "different" + the suffix ''πάϑος'', ''páthos'', "suffering") are terms coined in the early 19th century&lt;ref&gt;Hahnemann S (1810), [[The Organon of the Healing Art|Organon der Heilkunst]], first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; by Samuel Hahnemann,&lt;ref name=Whorton2004&gt;{{cite book|title = Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America|author=Whorton JC|edition=illustrated|editor=[[Oxford University Press US]]|year=2004|isbn=0-19-517162-4|pages = 18, 52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RU0DndWVSPoC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;vq=allopathy+allopathic+greek+hahnemann|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wf2vl2ch9a4C&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=allopathy&amp;ots=pAfm6X3vNP&amp;sig=uxnaBWPzkiigd6ThpYWk_UdNZ-w Haehl R, ''Samuel Hahnemann his Life and Works,'' 2 volumes, 1922; vol 2, p.234]&lt;/ref&gt; the inventor of homeopathy, as a synonym for the European [[heroic medicine]], the mainstream medicine of the time. Heroic medicine was based on balance of the four "humours" (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) where disease was caused by an excess of one humour, and would thus be treated with its opposite.&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/758098687|title=Consumer health: a guide to intelligent decisions|last1=Barrett|first1=Stephen|last2=London|first2=William M.|last3=Kroger|first3=Manfred|last4=Hall|first4=Harriet|last5=Baratz|first5=Robert S.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2013|isbn=9780078028489|edition=9th|location=New York|pages=34–35, 134, 137|oclc=758098687}}&lt;/ref&gt; This description continued to be used to describe anything that was not homeopathy.&lt;ref name="ConsumerHealth9th"/&gt;

==History==
The practice of medicine in both Europe and North America during the early 19th century is sometimes referred to as [[heroic medicine]] because of the extreme measures (such as [[bloodletting]]) sometimes employed in an effort to treat diseases.&lt;ref name = Trick&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bZjlC2LELlIC&amp;pg=PA108 | page = 108 | title = Trick Or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine | first = Simon | last = Singh | authorlink1 = Simon Singh | first2 = Edzard | last2 = Ernst | authorlink2 = Edzard Ernst | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company | year = 2008 | isbn=978-0-393-06661-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''allopath'' was used by Hahnemann and other early homeopaths to highlight the difference they perceived between homeopathy and the medicine of that time.

With the term allopathy (meaning "other than the disease"), Hahnemann intended to point out how physicians with conventional training employed therapeutic approaches that, in his view, merely treated symptoms and failed to address the disharmony produced by the underlying disease.{{clarify|date=March 2011}} Homeopaths saw such [[symptomatic treatment]]s as "opposites treating opposites" and believed these conventional methods were harmful to patients.&lt;ref name=Whorton2004/&gt;

Practitioners of alternative medicine have used the term "allopathic medicine" to refer to the practice of conventional medicine in both Europe and the United States since the 19th century. The term allopathic was used throughout the 19th century as a derogatory term for the practitioners of heroic medicine,&lt;ref name="DOI 10.1177/0002716202583001002"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/000271620258300102 |journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=September 2002 |volume=583 |issue=1 |pages=12–28 |title=Why Not Call Modern Medicine "Alternative"? |last=Bates|first=DG }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-7637-3888-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cuellar NG|title=Conversations in complementary and alternative medicine: insights and perspectives from leading practitioners |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=Boston |year=2006 |pages=4 |isbn=0-7637-3888-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nmkm7zu7NDMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; a precursor to modern medicine that did not rely on evidence.

James Whorton discusses this historical pejorative usage: {{quote|One form of verbal warfare used in retaliation by irregulars was the word "allopathy." ..."Allopathy" and "allopathic" were liberally employed as pejoratives by all irregular physicians of the nineteenth century, and the terms were considered highly offensive by those at whom they were directed. The generally uncomplaining acceptance of [the term] "allopathic medicine" by today's physicians is an indication of both a lack of awareness of the term's historical use and the recent thawing of relations between irregulars and allopaths.&lt;ref name=Whorton2003&gt;{{cite web |author=Whorton JC |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/altmed/clash/history.html |title=Counterculture healing: A brief history of alternative medicine in America |date=4 Nov 2003 |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation |accessdate=25 Dec 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The controversy surrounding the term can be traced to its original usage during a heated 19th-century debate between practitioners of homeopathy and those they derisively referred to as "allopaths."&lt;ref name=Whorton2002&gt;{{cite book |last=Whorton |first=JC |year=2002 |title=Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America |isbn=0-19-517162-4 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hahnemann used "allopathy" to refer to what he saw as a system of medicine that combats disease by using remedies that produce effects in a healthy subject that are different (hence Greek root ''allo-'' "different") from the effects produced by the disease to be treated. The distinction comes from the use in homeopathy of substances that are meant to cause similar effects as the symptoms of a disease to treat patients (''homeo'' - meaning similar).

As used by homeopaths, the term ''allopathy'' has always referred to the principle of curing disease by administering substances that produce other symptoms (when given to a healthy human) than the symptoms produced by a disease. For example, part of an allopathic treatment for [[fever]] may include the use of a drug which reduces the fever, while also including a drug (such as an [[Antibacterial|antibiotic]]) that attacks the cause of the fever (such as a bacterial infection). A homeopathic treatment for fever, by contrast, is one that uses a diluted and succussed dosage of a substance, usually containing no actual particles of that substance, that in an undiluted and unsuccussed form would induce fever in a healthy person. Hahnemann used this term to distinguish medicine as practiced in his time from his use of infinitesimally small (or nonexistent) doses of substances to treat the spiritual causes of illness.

The ''Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine'' states that "[Hahnemann] gave an all-embracing name to regular practice, calling it 'allopathy'. This term, however imprecise, was employed by his followers and other unorthodox movements to identify the prevailing methods as constituting nothing more than a competing 'school' of medicine, however dominant in terms of number of practitioner proponents and patients."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bynum |first1=W. F. |title=Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136110368 |page=608 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gyidO-ZLdiYC&amp;pg=PA608}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth century, some pharmacies labeled their products with the terms allopathic or homeopathic.

Contrary to the present usage, Hahnemann reserved the term "allopathic medicine" to the practice of treating diseases by means of drugs inducing symptoms unrelated (i.e., neither similar nor opposite) to those of the disease. He called the practice of treating diseases by means of drugs producing symptoms opposite to those of the patient "enantiopathic" or "antipathic medicine".&lt;ref&gt;e.g., see [https://books.google.com/books?id=n3YC435gKFIC&amp; Organon, VI edition], paragraphs 54-56&lt;/ref&gt; After Hahnemann's death, the term "enantiopathy" fell into disuse and the two concepts of allopathy and enantiopathy have been more or less unified. Both, however, indicate what Hahnemann thought about contemporary conventional medicine, rather than the current ideas of his colleagues. Conventional physicians had never assumed that the therapeutic effects of drugs were necessarily related to the symptoms they caused in the healthy: e.g., James Lind in 1747 systematically tested several common substances and foods for their effect on scurvy and discovered that lemon juice was specifically active; he clearly did not select lemon juice because it caused symptoms in the healthy man, either similar or opposite to those of scurvy.

==Current==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1027">'''Andamento''' is an Italian [[Glossary of musical terminology|musical term]] used to refer to a [[fugue]] [[subject (music)|subject]] of above-average length.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Walker|first=Paul M.|title=Andamento|work=[[Grove Music Online]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Definition==
The term was coined by [[G.B. Martini]] in the second volume of his work ''Esemplare, ossia Saggio fondamentale pratico di contrappunto'' (1775), which also featured the terms ''[[attacco]]'' and ''soggetto'' to refer to short and average-length fugue themes, respectively.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; In Martini's definition, a fugue theme of six 4/4 bars could be described as an andamento.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; The term found limited use outside of [[Italy]], but has been discussed by scholars.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

==Examples==
* The 'Amen' fugue in [[Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9209">In the [[criminal law]] of some countries, an '''''Antragsdelikt''''' (plural ''Antragsdelikte'') is a category of offence which cannot be prosecuted without a complaint by the victim. The same concept has been adopted in [[law of Japan|Japanese law]] under the name '''''shinkokuzai''''', in [[law of South Korea|South Korean law]] under the name '''''chingojoe''''', and in the [[law of the Republic of China]] (both during the early Republic period and on [[Taiwan]]) using various terms.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1"&gt;{{harvnb|Ota|2007|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huang|2000|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic definition==
The term comes from the [[German language]] words ''Antrag'' (petition) and ''Delikt'' (offence). ''Antragsdelikte'' are similar to, but not identical to ''Ermächtigungsdelikte''. For example, in Austria the latter category includes such offences as [[trespass]] or [[fraud]] committed in an emergency situation. The victim's consent is required for investigation of an ''Antragsdelikt'' to begin; no such consent is required in the case of an ''Ermächtigunsdelikt'', though the prosecutor will inform the victim. In both cases, actual prosecution of the offence will only proceed with the consent of the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hausmaninger|1998|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another term is ''Privatklagedelikte''.[https://books.google.com/books?id=MGdDfcqWjqcC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]

''Antragsdelikt'' is somewhat analogous to the concept of a [[compoundable offence]] in [[law of Thailand|Thai law]], though different from that same term in [[law of Malaysia|Malaysian law]] or [[law of Singapore|Singaporean law]].&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt;

==Germany==
&lt;!-- Below section translated from German Wikipedia article Antragsdelikt. Need to import Vorlage:German law section. --&gt;
The German Criminal Code ([[Strafgesetzbuch]]) lists the following as offences which will only be prosecuted on request:
*[[Breach of the peace]] ({{German law section|123|stgb|juris}})
*Violation of instructions during supervision of conduct  ({{German law section|145a|stgb|juris}})
*[[Defamation]] ({{German law section|185|stgb|juris}}, in conjunction with {{German law section|194|stgb|juris}})
*Violation of privacy and personal secrets ({{German law section|203|stgb|juris|text=203}} and {{German law section|204|stgb|juris|text=204}}, in conjunction with {{German law section|205|stgb|juris}})
*Domestic theft ({{German law section|247|stgb|juris}})
*[[TWOC|Taking Without Owner's Consent]] ({{German law section|248b|stgb|juris}})
*Energy theft ({{German law section|248c|stgb|juris}})
*Unlawfully offering an advantage ({{German law section|257|stgb|juris}})
*Thwarting of [[distraint]] ({{German law section|288|stgb|juris}})
*Unlawful retaking of goods pawned ({{German law section|289|stgb|juris}})
*[[Poaching]] of fish ({{German law section|293|stgb|juris}}, in conjunction with {{German law section|294|stgb|juris}})
*Acts committed under intoxication where the intoxication causes [[diminished responsibility]] ({{German law section|323a|stgb|juris}})
*Breach of fiscal secrecy ({{German law section|355|stgb|juris}})

In addition, the German Criminal Code states that the following offences will be prosecuted on the request of the victim or in the case of "special public interest":
*[[Statutory rape]], if the victim is between 14 and 16 years old and the offender older than 21 ({{German law section|182|stgb|juris}} para. 3)
*[[Exhibitionism]] ({{German law section|183|stgb|juris}})
*Violation of privacy and personal secrets ({{German law section|202a|stgb|juris|text=§§ 202 a}} and {{German law section|202b|stgb|juris|text=202 b}}, in conjunction with {{German law section|205|stgb|juris}})
*[[Battery (crime)|Battery]] ({{German law section|223|stgb|juris}}, in conjunction with {{German law section|230|stgb|juris}})
*Negligent battery ({{German law section|229|stgb|juris}}, in conjunction with § 230)
*[[Child abduction]] ({{German law section|235|stgb|juris}})
*[[Stalking]] ({{German law section|238|stgb|juris}} para. 1)
*Theft and embezzlement of low-value items ({{German law section|248a|stgb|juris}})
*Corruption and bribery in business transactions ({{German law section|299|stgb|juris}}, in conjunction with {{German law section|301|stgb|juris}})
*[[Property damage]] ({{German law section|303|stgb|juris}}, in conjunction with  {{German law section|303c|stgb|juris}})
*Unlawful alteration of data ({{German law section|303a|stgb|juris}}, in conjunction with § 303c)
*Computer sabotage ({{German law section|303b|stgb|juris}}, in conjunction with § 303c)

==Japan==
The concept of ''shinkokuzai'' first entered into Japanese law in the early [[Meiji period]]. The 1870 criminal code {{nihongo|''Shinritsu Kōryō''|新律綱領}}, though it did not use the term directly, stated that the prosecution of a number of violent offences between husband and wife depended on a complaint by the person in question. The phrase used to express this condition, ''[[wikt:みずから|mizukara]] [[wikt:告げる|tsugeru]] wo mate'', is probably the origin of the modern term ''shinkokuzai''; ''mizukara tsugeru'' (to inform personally) contains two of the same [[kanji]] used to write ''shinkokuzai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kurosawa|2006|pages=408–410}}: 「親ラ告ルヲ待テ。乃坐ス。」&lt;/ref&gt; The draft criminal code of November 1877 used the term ''shinkokuzai'' directly in the definitions of various offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kurosawa|2006|pages=420–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under modern Japanese law, [[Sex and the law|sexual offences]] such as simple [[rape]] or [[indecent assault]] are categorised as ''shinkokuzai'', lest a prosecution against the victim's will result in [[effects and aftermath of rape#Secondary victimization|secondary victimisation]] or infringement of [[privacy]].&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt;

==South Korea==
In South Korea, the following offences are categorised as ''chingojoe'':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doosan Encyclopedia|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Criminal [[adultery]]
*[[Defamation]] against a dead person, and
*[[Contempt of court]]

==Republic of China==
{{see also|Legal history of China}}
The term ''qīn'gàozuì'' was used in laws in China's early Republic era (1912–1928), for example in the 1921 Criminal Procedure Ordinance or the 1928 Criminal Procedure Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huang|2000|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in modern terminology, the concept of a crime for which there will be no trial without complaint is usually expressed as ''gàosunǎilùn zhī zuì'' (告訴乃論之罪). A 1999 amendment to Taiwan's  [[Criminal Code of the Republic of China|Criminal Code]] removed indecent assault and rape (with the exception of [[spousal rape]]) from this category.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2"&gt;{{harvnb|Ota|2007|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People's Republic of China==
The Criminal Code of the People's Republic of China&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/legal/2003-01/21/content_5679505.htm 中华人民共和国刑法]&lt;/ref&gt; uses the term ''gàosù cái chǔlǐ'' (告诉才处理, lit. "action only if complained"). There are currently five offenses in this category, all minor offenses against individuals: insult, defamation, infringement of freedom of marriage (usually by parents), maltreat (of family members) and ordinary embezzlement. However, the Criminal Code does state that any such offense resulting in serious consequences (e.g. serious injury or death) is prosecutable without complaint.

==Egypt==
While no formal class of law equivalent to the ''Antragsdelikt'' exists in the [[Egyptian law|law]] of [[Egypt]], several religious crimes, including [[apostasy]], cannot be prosecuted on the initiative of the public prosecutor; the case must instead be raised by another citizen.

'''Avigdor Hameiri''' ([[Hebrew]]: אביגדור המאירי; September 16, 1890 - April 3, 1970) was an Israeli author.

==Biography==
Hameiri was born as Emil&lt;ref name="Seymour-Smith"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Martin Seymour-Smith|title=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Guide to Modern World Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j8ekFmQfNykC|date=1 January 1973|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls|id={{ISBN|978-0-308-10079-4}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Avigdor Feuerstein in 1890, in the village of Odavidhaza (near [[Munkatsch]]), [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] in [[Austria Hungary]]. He [[Aliyah|emigrated]] to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] in 1921, and fought in the 1948 War of Independence. He published the State's first independent newspaper and helped to organize the worker's bank. His book, ''[[Hannah Senesh]]'' is an obligatory  reading for all Israeli school children. Hameiri was the first poet to whom the title Israel's Poet Laureate was awarded.

Hameiri fought in [[World War I]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian]] army and recorded the events in his memoirs, ''The Great Madness'' (1929)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promised-book.com/?m%3D1%26bid%3D370 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082716/http://www.promised-book.com/?m=1&amp;bid=370 |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Hell on Earth'' (1932).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l6bRVTyzjSkC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22Budapest+Rabbinical+Seminary%22&amp;ei=1YXrSazgJJq0MaaOgOoF&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=Avigdor&amp;f=false ''The Limits of Loyalty''. Cole, Laurence, et al., 2007, p. 185.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter recounts his experiences as a [[POW]] of the Russians.  Hameiri marched through [[Buczacz]] while fighting, and asked a civilian where the house of the famous Hebrew writer [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]] was located.  His books have been published in 12 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ithl.org.il/author_info.asp?id%3D108 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614054827/http://www.ithl.org.il/author_info.asp?id=108 |archivedate=2012-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alon Rachamimov writes that Hameiri's war stories "reveal the degree to which [[Jewish identity|Jewish identification]] processes could be contextual, angst-ridden, and laden with contradictory tendencies.

'''Bajaw''' is the language of the [[Bajau people|Bajaw]] '[[Sama-Bajau peoples|Sea Gypsies]]' of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Differences exist between the language's varieties in western Sabah, [[Cagayan]] in the southern Philippines (= Mapun Bajaw/Sama), eastern Sabah, and Sulawesi/Maluku, but it is not clear how many languages these would be based on [[mutual intelligibility]].

==Distribution==
'''West Coast Bajau''' is distributed in the following locations of [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]] (''Ethnologue'').
*scattered along the west coast from [[Papar, Malaysia|Papar]] district to [[Kudat]] district, mainly in [[Tuaran]] and [[Kota Belud]] towns
*Telutu’ village, [[Banggi Island]], [[Kudat]] district
*[[Pitas, Malaysia|Pitas]] district: along the west coast and Mengkubau Laut, Mengkapon, Dalima’, Mapan-Mapan, Pantai Laut, Layag-Layag, Mausar, Jambangan, Sibayan Laut, and Kanibungan villages

'''Indonesian Bajau''' is widely distributed throughout [[Sulawesi]] and [[Nusa Tenggara]]. It is also located throughout [[Maluku Utara]] Province in the [[Bacan Islands]], [[Obi Islands]], [[Kayoa]], and [[Sula Islands]], which are located to the southwest of [[Halmahera]] Island (''Ethnologue'').

'''Mapun''' is spoken on Cagayan de Sulu ([[Mapun]]) island, [[Tawi-Tawi]], Philippines.

[[File:Boyle 70 numeral.jpg|right|thumb|Numeral 70 identifying [[Boyle, County Roscommon|Boyle]], diamond bars for [[Ireland]]]]A '''cancellation''' (or '''cancel''' for short; French: "oblitération") is a [[postal marking]] applied on a [[postage stamp]] or [[postal stationery]] to deface the stamp and prevent its re-use. Cancellations come in a huge variety of designs, shapes, sizes and colors. Modern United States cancellations commonly include the date and post office location where the stamps were mailed, in addition to lines or bars designed to cover the stamp itself.  The term "postal marking" sometimes is used to refer specifically to the part that contains the date and posting location, although the term often is used interchangeably with "cancellation."&lt;ref&gt;L.N. Williams, ''Fundamentals of Philately'' (American Philatelic Society, State College, PA rev. ed. 1990) p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The portion of a cancellation that is designed to deface the stamp and does not contain writing is also called the "'''obliteration'''"&lt;ref name="scott1"&gt;[[#Scott US|Scott US]] p. 30A.&lt;/ref&gt;  or '''[[Killer (philately)|killer]]'''. Some stamps are issued  '''pre-cancelled''' with a printed or stamped cancellation and do not need to have a cancellation added.  Cancellations can affect the value of stamps to collectors, positively or negatively. The cancellations of some countries have been extensively studied by [[philatelists]] and many stamp collectors and postal history collectors collect cancellations in addition to the stamps themselves.

==History==
The first adhesive [[postage stamp]] was the [[Penny Black]], issued in 1840 by [[Postage stamps and postal history of Great Britain|Great Britain]].  The postal authorities recognized there must be a method for preventing reuse of the stamps and simultaneously issued handstamps for use to apply cancellations to the stamps on the envelopes as they passed through the postal system.&lt;ref name="sg_p42"&gt;[[#Stanley Gibbons|Stanley Gibbons]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cancels were handmade and depicted a [[Maltese cross]] design.  Initially, the ink used was red, but it was found that this could be cleaned off and the stamps reused, and so after a series of experiments, early in 1841 black cancelling ink was used, which was more permanent. The color of the stamps was also changed to red-brown so as to ensure that the cancellation showed clearly.&lt;ref name="sg_p42"/&gt;

Britain soon abandoned the Maltese crosses and in 1844 began to employ cancellations displaying numbers which referred to the location of mailing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stanley Gibbons|Stanley Gibbons]], pp. 51-55.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar scheme was used for British stamps used abroad in its colonies and foreign postal services, with locations being assigned a specific letter followed by a number, such as A01 used in Kingston, Jamaica, or D22 for Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;Stanely Gibbons, ''Stamp Catalogue, Part 1, British Commonwealth 1987'', London &amp; Ringwood (89th ed. 1986), pp. GB65-GB72.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US stamp 1851 3c Washington.jpg|upright|thumb|An 1851 U.S. stamp with a [[pen cancel]]lation.]]
Early cancellations were all applied by hand, commonly using hand stamps.  Where hand stamps were not available, stamps often were cancelled by marking over the stamp with pen, such as writing an "x".  Pen cancellations were used in the United States into the 1880s,&lt;ref name="scott2"&gt;[[#Scott US|Scott US]] p. 29A.&lt;/ref&gt;  and in a sense continue to this day, when a postal clerk notices a stamp has escaped cancellation and marks it with a ball point pen or [[marker pen|marker]].

[[File:Sicily13.JPG|thumb|upright|1859 stamp of Sicily with deferential cancellation designed not to deface the "sacred image" of [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand II]]&lt;ref&gt;Franco Filanci, ''Lettera &amp; Francobollo: Raccontiamola giusta'' Reggiani, Italy 2008, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the early period of the issuance of postage stamps in the United States a number of [[patent]]s were issued for cancelling devices or machines that increased (or were purported to increase) the difficulty of washing off and reusing postage stamps.  These methods generally involved the scraping or cutting-away of part of the stamp, or perhaps punching a hole through its middle.  (These forms of cancellation must be distinguished from [[perfins]], a series of small holes punched in stamps, typically by private companies as an anti-theft device.)

High speed cancellation machines were first used in Boston between 1880–1890 and subsequently throughout the country.&lt;ref name="scott2"/&gt;

Today, cancellations may either be applied by hand or machine.  Hand cancellation is often used when sending unusually shaped mail or formal mail (e.g., wedding invitations) to avoid damage caused by machine cancellation.

Postal meter stamps and similar modern printed to order stamps are not ordinarily cancelled by postal authorities because such stamps bear the date produced and can not readily be re-used.

==Types of cancellations==
* '''[[Socked on the nose|Bullseye cancellation]]''' also called "Socked on the nose" or SOTN, is a stamp collector's term for a cancellation, typically of circular design, centered on the postage stamp. Such cancellations are popular with some stamp collectors because of their neatness and the fact that the time, date, and location where the stamp was used may be readily seen. The prevalence of bulls-eye cancellations varies considerably by country and time period.
* '''[[Cancelled-to-order]]'''.  Cancelled-to-order stamps, also known as CTOs, are stamps that have been cancelled by a postal authority, but were never used to transmit mail. CTOs are created by postal authorities to sell the stamps cheaply to stamp collectors.  Many Eastern European countries and others sold great numbers of CTOs to collectors in the 1950s - 1990s strictly for revenue.  CTOs often may be identified as the stamps still retain their original gum.  Some authorities use the same canceller for all CTOs, and apply it very neatly in the corner of four stamps at one time. In some instances, the "cancellations" are actually printed as part of the stamp itself.
* '''Deferential cancellation''' is a cancellation designed so as not to deface the image of the ruler or regent on the stamp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askphil.org/b25d.htm Glossary of Stamp Collecting Terms] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66rutVorE?url=http://127.0.0.1/# |date=2012-04-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Canada37.jpg|upright|thumb|Fancy cancel on 1872 Canada stamp]]
* A '''[[duplex cancel]]''' includes a postmark as well as the cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glossary.usstamps.org/glossary5.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913192456/http://glossary.usstamps.org/glossary5.html |archivedate=2007-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Fancy cancels]]'''.  In the second half of the 19th century, many postmasters in the United States and Canada cut their own cancelers from [[Cork (material)|cork]] or wood in a great variety of designs such as stars, circles, flags, chickens, etc.  These are known as fancy cancels and have been heavily studied by philatelists and collectors.&lt;ref name="scott2"/&gt;  One of the most famous is the "kicking mule" used in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Henry Cornell, ''The tale of the kicking mule; a handbook dealing with the famous kicking mule cancellation used in several western towns in the "eighties"'' (Printcraft Shop, Wichita 1949).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[First day of issue]]''' are special cancellations with the date the stamp was first issued for sale and the words "first day of issue."
* '''Flag cancellations''' are a type of machine cancellation incorporating  a design of the United States flag with the stripes serving as the "killer".  The first machine flag cancel (preceded by fancy cancels of flags) was used in Boston in November–December 1894.&lt;ref name="scott2"/&gt;
* '''Handstamped cancellations''' are cancellations added by means of a hand stamping device.
* '''Highway post office cancels''' refers to cancels added in transit by portable mail-handling equipment for sorting mail in trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linns.com/insights/glossary-of-philatelic-terms.html|title=Glossary of Stamp-Collecting Terms For New Collectors - Linns.com|website=Linn's Stamp News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Machine postmark|Machine cancellations]]''' are automatically added by machines that rapidly process large numbers of envelopes.  A 1903 silent film of an operating cancelling machine may be seen [http://memory.loc.gov/mbrs/awal/0870.mpg here].
* '''Mute cancel''' refers to a cancellation that includes no writing and thus "does not speak."
* '''Numeral cancels''' are cancels whereby number were used to identify specific post offices. For the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], which started using numerals in 1844, the shape of bars indicate the actual country of use. Numerals were also used in combination with a datestamp in duplex cancellations.
* '''[[Pen cancel]]s''' refer to the use of a writing [[pen]] to deface the stamp, and were more common in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
* '''Pictorial cancellations''' include images associated with the commemoration of some event or anniversary.  Some people attempt to use stamps relating to the theme of a pictorial cancellation on the envelope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcgees.org/postalcancel/postalcancelintro.shtml|title=Postal Cancel Art|website=www.mcgees.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See further below.

[[File:Stamp US 1938 2c precancel.jpg|upright|thumb|U.S.1938 precancelled stamp]]
* '''[[Precancel]]s''' are stamps that have been issued with printed cancellations on them, typically to mass mailers. Precancels cannot normally be used by the general public.
* '''[[Railway post office|Railway post office (R.P.O.) cancels]]''' refer to cancellations applied on mail sorted on trains.  The first United States cancellation with the word "railroad" dates from 1838.&lt;ref name="scott1"/&gt;  The last Railway Post Office (R.P.O.) operated by the United States closed in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linns.com/insights/glossary-of-philatelic-terms.html|title=Glossary of Stamp-Collecting Terms For New Collectors - Linns.com|website=Linn's Stamp News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Mail steamer|Ship cancels]]''' were added to stamps that were mailed on or carried on a ship, commonly a steamer ship in the late 19th-early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="scott1"/&gt;  In French, the cancellation reads "'''Paquebot'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linns.com/insights/glossary-of-philatelic-terms.html|title=Glossary of Stamp-Collecting Terms For New Collectors - Linns.com|website=Linn's Stamp News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Slogan cancellations''' contain a slogan, perhaps commemorative or advertising, in the killer box.  See further below.

==Pictorial and special cancellations==
[[Image:Somnathpur pictorial cancellation.JPG|right|thumb|'''Pictorial cancellation'''.  This post box is located at a historical site [[Somnathpur]] in [[Karnataka]], [[India]].  Letters posted in this box will receive a special cancellation with an image of the Kesava temple. ]]

The [[United States Postal Service]] distinguishes between '''special cancellations''' which have a caption publicizing an event,&lt;ref&gt;There are regulations pertaining to the special cancellations. See [http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/608.htm#wp1227808 Philatelic (Stamp Collecting) Services: Special Cancellations] (retrieved 15 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  and '''pictorial cancellations''', which contain an image of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.usps.com/cpim/ftp/pubs/pub186/welcome.htm |title=USPS: Celebrating With Pictorial Postmarks |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509032623/https://www.usps.com/cpim/ftp/pubs/pub186/welcome.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special cancellations are essentially a type of slogan cancellations.

[[Image:Postmark US airmail saves time.jpg|right|thumb|A 1929 pictorial cancellation promoting the use of airmail.]]
In the United States, official pictorial cancellations are almost invariably applied at special "stations", i.e., [[post office]]s existing only for a limited time, usually one day, at special events, although there are frequently other pictorial cancellations that are not officially described as such — they are among what are called special cancellations and are special die-hubs added to machine cancels, which usually contain merely a slogan but sometimes contain a picture.
There are a very few exceptions in which a particular post office uses a pictorial cancellation on all its mail. 
[[Image:DC3Stamp.JPG|right|thumb|Cancellation showing Douglas Isle of Man and Douglas DC 3.]]
The range of allowable subjects is very broad, and may include a variety of commercial tie-ins, such as to movie characters.

[[Canada Post]] uses automated cancellations with computer-printed messaging. In this way, the corporation can automatically print promotional messages on each envelope while simultaneously cancelling the piece of mail. Messages change throughout the year, and include seasonal messages ("Merry Christmas / Joyeux Noel") and promotional messages (such as Canada Post's web address).

Other post offices such as the [[Isle of Man Post|Isle of Man Philatelic Bureau]] also create special pictorial cancellations as they did in 1985 to mark the anniversary of the aircraft Douglas [[DC-3]].  A special handstamp was created &lt;ref name=LS-13-12-1985 &gt;Top-flight honour for schoolboy - Front Page - Lincolnshire Standard - 13 December 1985&lt;/ref&gt; depicting a Dakota flying "free" and not "boxed in".&lt;ref&gt;Special Dakota Cover Inside Information Card - [[Isle of Man Post|Isle of Man Philatelic Bureau]] - 17 December 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collectors==
Generalist stamp collectors usually prefer '''lightly cancelled''' stamps which have the postmark on a corner or small portion of the stamp without obscuring the stamp itself, which ordinarily are more valuable than '''heavily-cancelled stamps'''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Scott Catalogue]], note preceding Great Britain listings.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to get the postal clerk to cancel the stamps lightly, collectors may rubber-stamp or write "philatelic mail" on the envelope.

Cancellations may significantly affect the value of the stamps.  Many stamps are rarer, and consequently much more expensive, in unused condition, such as the Penny Black, which in 1999, catalogued for $1,900 mint and $110 used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Catalogue]], Great Britain, no. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reverse is true for some stamps, such as the hyperinflation stamps of [[Postage stamps and postal history of Germany|Germany]], which may be worth many times more if genuinely postally used.&lt;ref name="catalogue1"&gt;[[Scott Catalogue]], Germany, no. 161-321 and note preceding no.161.&lt;/ref&gt;  Where stamps are much more valuable in used condition than unused, it may be advisable to  have such stamps [[Expertization|expertised]] to confirm that the cancellation is genuine and contemporary.&lt;ref name="catalogue1"/&gt;

Some stamp collectors are interested in the cancellations themselves, on or off cover, of a particular country or issue, or collect a specific type of cancellation, such as fancy cancels. There have been many published studies of the cancellations of many countries, some of which are listed below.  Collectors who are interested in the cancellations themselves prefer bold, readable cancellations.  Cancellations also are an integral part of the collection of [[postal history]]. 

Historically, collectors disliked pen cancels and removed many of them, making the stamp appear unused or to add a fake cancellation.&lt;ref name="scott2"/&gt;  Today, early United States pen cancelled stamps still are worth considerably less than examples with  hand stamped cancels.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g, [[#Scott US|Scott US]] values for nos. 1-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectors generally view modern cancelled-to-order stamps or CTOs as philatelic junk, and they rarely have any significant value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Postmarks |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://www.linns.com/reference/postmark/basic_postmarks.aspx |accessdate=June 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318065946/http://www.linns.com/reference/postmark/basic_postmarks.aspx |archivedate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stamp catalogs commonly state whether their values for used stamps are for CTOs or for postally used examples.  For example, the Scott Catalog used value listings for the German Democratic Republic are for CTOs from 1950 through mid-1990, over 2700 stamps.&lt;ref&gt;''Scott 1999 Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue, Vol. 3'' Germany listings, note preceding no. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forgeries==
{{main|Philatelic fakes and forgeries}}
Forgers have not only manufactured stamps for the philatelic market, they have added forged cancellations to those stamps.  This was especially common in the late 19th century and early 20th century, when huge numbers of inexpensive stamps were forged for the packet trade.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[Robert Brisco Earée|R.B. Earée]], ''Album Weeds; How to Detect Forged Stamps'' (3d Ed. reprint, Manuka-Ainslie Press, Acton, Canberra n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Forged cancellations have also been applied to genuine stamps, in cases where the stamps are worth much more postally used.  In addition, where rare cancellations are desired by collectors, those cancellations have also been forged.

Cancellations may also be used to prove that certain philatelic items are genuine.  For example, forgers have fabricated many supposedly valuable postal covers by adding genuine stamps and forged postal markings to pre-stamp covers.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Jean-François Brun, ''Out-Foxing the Fakers'' (American Philatelic Society, State College, PA 1993), Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  A cover can be shown to be genuine if a genuine cancellation "ties" the stamp or stamps to the cover; that is, if a genuine cancellation runs continuously over the stamp and adjacent portion of the envelope, although one still may need to rule out the possibility that the cancellation was added later.  Similarly, stamps that were cut in parts and used for a portion of the full value as [[Bisects and splits (philately)|splits]] can only be shown to have been so used if a genuine cancel ties the stamp to the cover or piece of cover.

The Chhantyal language is a member of the [[Tamangic languages|Tamangic group]] (along with Gurung, Thakali, Manangba, [[Nar-Phu language|Nar-Phu]] and Tamang) of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family]]. Within its group, it is lexically and grammatically closest to [[Thakali language|Thakali]].

A '''clear-channel station''' is an [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[radio station]] in [[North America]] that has the highest protection from [[Interference (communication)|interference]] from other stations, particularly concerning night-time [[skywave]] propagation. The system exists to ensure the viability of cross-country or cross-continent radio service, and is enforced through a series of treaties and statutory laws. Now known as '''Class A''' stations since 1982, they are occasionally still referred to by their former classifications of '''Class I-A''' (the highest classification), '''Class I-B'''  (the next highest class), or '''Class I-N''' (for stations in [[Alaska]] too far away to cause interference to the primary clear-channel stations in the lower 48 states). The term "clear-channel" is used most often in the context of [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]], where the concept originated.

Since 1941, these stations have been required to maintain at least 10,000 [[watt]]s of power to retain their status. Nearly all these stations in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[The Bahamas]] broadcast at 50,000 watts, with several clear-channel stations in [[Mexico]] going as high as 150,000 watts and [[XEW (AM)|XEW]] in [[Mexico City]] operating at 250,000 watts for over 80 years. ([[Cuba]] was originally included in the plan and had several stations given clear-channel status, but Cuba stopped participating after 1959.)

==Description==
Sixty [[medium wave]] frequencies were set aside in 1941 under the [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]] (NARBA) for nighttime use by only one, two or three specific AM stations, covering a wide area via [[skywave]] [[Radio propagation|propagation]]. These frequencies were known as the "clear channels", and the stations on them are thus clear-channel stations. NARBA set aside 37 Class I-A frequencies and 27 Class I-B frequencies. The Class I-N stations in Alaska shared those same frequencies. Where only one station was assigned to a clear channel, the treaty provides that it must operate with a [[nominal power]] of 50 [[Watt|kilowatts]] or more. These were for the most part Class I-A. Stations on the other clear channels, with two or more stations, must use between 10&amp;nbsp;kW and 50&amp;nbsp;kW, and most often use a [[directional antenna]] so as not to interfere with each other. In addition to the frequencies, the treaty also specified the specific locations where stations on Class I-B channels could be built.

Some of the original NARBA signatories, including the United States, Canada and Mexico, have implemented bilateral agreements that supersede NARBA's terms, eliminating among other things the distinction between the two kinds of clear channel: the original "I-A" and "I-B" classes, and the newer, U.S.-only "I-N" class, which are now all included in [[List of North American broadcast station classes|class A]]. Classes "I-A" and "I-B" still mandate a minimum efficiency of 362.10 mV/m/kW at 1&amp;nbsp;km, whereas Class "I-N" is permitted to use the lower Class B minimum efficiency of 281.63 mV/m/kW at 1&amp;nbsp;km. There exist exceptions, where a former Class B station was elevated to Class A, yet it maintained its previous antenna system, or made only minor changes thereto.

Clear-channel stations, unlike all other AM stations in North America, have a ''secondary service area''; that is, they are entitled to protection from interference to their nighttime skywave signals. Other stations are entitled, at most, to protection from nighttime interference in their ''primary service area''—that which is covered by their [[groundwave]] signal.

Many stations beyond those listed in the treaty have been assigned to operate on a clear channel (and some had been long before NARBA came into effect in 1941). In most cases, those stations operate during the daytime only, so as not to interfere with the primary stations on those channels. Since the early 1980s, many such stations have been permitted to operate at night with such low power as to be deemed not to interfere; these stations are still considered "daytimers" and are not entitled to any protection from interference to their nighttime signals. Another group of stations, formerly known as ''class II'' stations, were licensed to operate on the former "I-B" clear channels with significant power at night, provided that they use directional antenna systems to minimize radiation towards the primary stations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[iHeartMedia, Inc.]] (formerly [[Clear Channel Communications]] until September 2014), a [[San Antonio, Texas]]-based company that owns over 1000 U.S. radio stations, was originally formed to purchase one clear-channel station, 1200 [[WOAI (AM)|WOAI]] in its home city of San Antonio. The company now owns more than a dozen such stations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==History==
{{See also|Medium wave#Medium wave in the Americas}}
For the U.S., a form of clear channels first appeared in 1922 when the [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce Department]] moved stations which had all used three (initially two) frequencies (two for entertainment stations, one for "weather and crop reports") onto 52 frequencies. Two were set aside for low-power local and regional stations, while the large stations in major cities each got their own frequency. A few frequencies were used on both the East and West coasts, which were considered far enough apart to limit interference. At that time, large stations were limited to 1000 watts and some licences were revoked.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

On November 11, 1928 the [[United States]] implemented [[General Order 40]], which classified each allocation in the [[AM band]] as either Local, Regional or Clear. The classification system considered stations in [[Canada]] as well. Gradually maximum power was increased to 50,000 watts: additionally there were some short-lived experiments with 250–500 kilowatt "super-power" operations. This system was continued in the 1941 NARBA system, although almost all stations shifted broadcast frequencies. The FCC's intent behind licensing 50,000 watt ''clear-channel'' stations was to provide reliable radio service to the thousands of Americans who lived in the vast rural areas of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Rural Radio Magazine'', Vol. 1 No. 1, Clear Channel Group (November 1938), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, these stations usually reached large portions of North America at night. Radio fans often call such stations "flamethrowers" or "blowtorches" because of their high power.

As early as the 1930s, debate raged in [[Washington, D.C.]], and in the U.S. broadcasting industry over whether continuation of the clear-channel system was justifiable. The licensees of clear-channel stations argued that, without their special status, many rural areas would receive no radio service at all. Rural broadcasters pointed out that most of the clear-channel stations were licensed to serve large cities on the two coasts, which made little sense for a service that was meant to provide radio to the vast rural areas in the middle of the country. The clear-channel licensees requested that the power limit on the "I-A" channels in the U.S., set at 50&amp;nbsp;kW by the FCC, be lifted entirely. They pointed to successful experiments made by [[WLW]] in [[Cincinnati]] before the war, and in later years successful implementation by state broadcasters in Europe and the Middle East, as evidence that this would work and improve the service received by most Americans. Other broadcasters, particularly in the western states, argued to the contrary; that if the special status of the clear-channel stations was eliminated, ''they'' would be able to build facilities to provide local service to those rural "dark areas".

One of the most outspoken of the small-town broadcasters, [[Ed Craney]] of KGIR in [[Butte, Montana]], went so far as to apply to move his station, then on the 1370&amp;nbsp;kHz regional channel, to a class I-A signal on 660&amp;nbsp;kHz, asking the FCC to downgrade the [[NBC Red Network|NBC]] New York [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]], [[WFAN (AM)|WEAF]], to make way for the Butte station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = KGIR, Butte, Requests 50 kw. On WEAF Clear Channel | date = September 1, 1941 | work = Broadcasting and Broadcast Advertising | location = Washington, D.C. | publisher = Broadcasting Publications, Inc. | volume = 21 | issue = 9 | page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC denied Craney's petition.

In 1941 several existing clear-channel stations applied for power increases to between 500 and 750&amp;nbsp;kW;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | work = [[Broadcasting &amp; Cable|Broadcasting and Broadcast Advertising]] | title = WHAS Superpower | date = October 27, 1941 | page = 52 | volume = 21 | issue = 17 | publisher = Broadcasting Publications, Inc. | location = Washington, D.C. | quote = A half-dozen other applications ranging from 500,000 to 750,000 watts now are pending}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | work = [[Broadcasting &amp; Cable|Broadcasting and Broadcast Advertising]] | title = WSB Revives Its 500-kw. Application, Seventh Stations Seeking Superpower | date = November 3, 1941 | page = 57 | volume = 21 | issue = 18 | quote = Already pending before the Commission were the applications of WLW, Cincinnati, for 650,000 watts, WOAI, San Antonio, seeking 750,000 watts, KSL, Salt Lake City, for 500,000 watts, and WSM, Nashville asking 500,000-watt operation. Similarly the application of WHO, Des Moines, for an increase to 500,000 watts is reported to be about ready for filing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; dissemination of national defense information is cited as one reason this would be in the public interest. In October 1941 the FCC's engineering department presented a report on a complete reorganization of the clear-channel service; the report considered the possibility of "some 25 superpower stations of 500,000 watts or more, strategically located to provide maximum service" (as ''Broadcasting'' described it), and suggested that stations would have to be relocated away from the east and west coasts in such a scenario, as coastal stations waste energy over the oceans. One complication the FCC considered was the "[[Wheeler resolution]]", passed by the [[United States Senate]] in 1938, expressing the view of the Senate that radio stations should be limited to a maximum power of 50&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | work = [[Broadcasting &amp; Cable|Broadcasting and Broadcast Advertising]] | title = Superpower, Clear Channels Slated for Early FCC Probe | date = October 20, 1941 | volume = 21 | issue = 16 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One station, [[KKOB (AM)|KOB]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], fought a long legal battle against the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) and [[New York City|New York's]] [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] for the right to move from a regional channel to a clear channel, 770&amp;nbsp;kHz, arguing that the New York signal was so weak in the mountain west that it served no one. KOB eventually won the argument in the late 1960s; it and several other western stations were allowed to move to eastern clear channels. (Western clear channels, such as [[KNBR|680]] in [[San Francisco]], had been "duplicated" in the eastern states for many years.) These new ''class II-A'' assignments (in places like [[KBOI (AM)|Boise, Idaho]]; [[KDWN|Las Vegas]] and [[KKOH|Reno, Nevada]]; [[KRVN (AM)|Lexington, Nebraska]]; [[KTWO (AM)|Casper, Wyoming]]; [[KOFI|Kalispell, Montana]]; and others) began what would later be called "the breakdown of the clear channels". The class I-A station owners' proposal to increase power fifteenfold was not immediately quashed, but the new II-A stations would make it effectively impossible for stations on the duplicated channels to do so, and the owners eventually lost interest. That proposal was finally taken off the FCC's docket in the late 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

On May 29, 1980 the FCC voted to limit the protection for all clear-channel stations to a 750-mile (1&amp;nbsp;207&amp;nbsp;km) radius around the [[transmitter]]. Stations on those frequencies outside the area of protection were no longer required to sign off or power down after sundown.&lt;ref&gt;''Facts on File 1980 Yearbook'', p. 519&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 the FCC changed its rules to prohibit applications for new "class-D" stations. (Class-D stations have night power between zero and 250 watts, and frequently operate on clear channels.) However, any existing station could voluntarily relinquish nighttime authority, thereby becoming a class-D, and several have done so since the rule change.

===Daytimers===
Daytimers (also known as daytime-only stations) are [[AM radio]] stations that are limited to broadcasting during the daytime only, as their signals would interfere with clear-channel and other radio stations at night, when solar radiation is reduced, and medium wave radio signals can propagate much farther. Such stations are usually supposed to do one of three things: sign off, reduce power (sometimes dramatically, to only a few watts), or switch to another (typically near-by) frequency, such as the Detroit area's [[WNZK]] (690 day, 680 night). Their [[List of North American broadcast station classes|broadcast class]] is Class D. A number of these stations also broadcast on the internet and have separate streams that air when the station's over-the-air signal has signed-off.

Daytime-only stations first originated in the late 1920s shortly after General Order 40 was imposed. One of the first to do so was WKEN in [[Kenmore, New York]] (now [[WUFO]]). WKEN proposed the concept to avoid the then-common practice of having to share one frequency between multiple stations; under General Order 40, WKEN would have had to share its frequency with [[WWKB|WKBW]], and the daytime-only proposal allowed both stations their own frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fybush.com/sites/2010/site-100226.html|title=Remembering Buffalo's BBC|first=Scott|last=Fybush|date=February 26, 2010|work=Tower Site of the Week|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; WUFO remains a daytime-only station to the present day.

As of 2013, daytimers only exist in the United States and Mexico. The last Canadian daytime station, [[CJDL-FM|CKOT]], signed off on February 17 of that year after converting to the FM band. There were 61 daytimers in Mexico in 2015.{{mexico-inf|AM|accessdate=2015-12-15}}

First is the Canada, Mexico, and contiguous United States table, for the former class I-A and class I-B stations. [[General Order 40]] allocations are in bold.

Second is the Alaska table, for the former class I-N stations.

Under the most recent treaty, Mexican Class A stations which previously operated with 50&amp;nbsp;kW or less (but a minimum of 10&amp;nbsp;kW nights) may increase power to 100&amp;nbsp;kW days while retaining their 10&amp;nbsp;kW night operation. This created some anomalies where stations licensed for 10&amp;nbsp;kW during all hours could increase power to 100&amp;nbsp;kW days and 10&amp;nbsp;kW nights, unless a directional antenna system was installed for nights, in which case the maximum night power was 50&amp;nbsp;kW. Additionally, one Class B station which had been operating non-directionally with 100&amp;nbsp;kW days and 50&amp;nbsp;kW nights was required to reduce power to 50&amp;nbsp;kW during all hours.

&lt;!-- Editors see talk page for data source. Do not add stations to this list; the treaties do not permit additions, so the list does not expand. --&gt;

Despite leaving the air, it remained notified to the U.S. as a class-A allotment. A new license has since been granted to Tietolman-Tétrault-Pancholy Media (TTP) to broadcast a French news-talk format at 940 AM by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]]. After numerous delays, the station began broadcasting a series of test tones intermittently on October 26, 2016. Official testing began on November 16, 2016 with music and recorded announcements with a phone number to report signal interference. Although the station was given a deadline of November 21, 2016 by the CRTC to launch its French news-talk format, the station has yet to do so.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of introducing a consent decree begins with negotiation.&lt;ref name="resnik2015" /&gt; One of the three happens: a [[lawsuit]] is filed and the parties concerned reach an agreement prior to [[adjudication]] of the contested issues; a lawsuit is filed and actively contested, and the parties reach an agreement after the court has ruled on some issues; or the parties settle their dispute prior to the filing of a lawsuit and they simultaneously file a lawsuit and request that the court agree to the entry of [[Judgment (law)|judgment]].&lt;ref name="resnik2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=isenbergh1940&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Isenbergh | first1=Maxwell S. | last2=Rubin | first2=Seymour J. | year=1940 | title=Antitrust Enforcement Through Consent Decrees | journal=Harvard Law Review | volume=53 | issue=3 | pages=386-414 | doi=10.2307/1333475 | issn=0017-811X | jstor=1333475 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kane&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Procedure in a Nutshell|last=Kane|first=Mary Kay|publisher=West Publ.|year=2001|isbn=978-0-314-09398-1|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|oclc=249079229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court is meant to turn this agreement into a judicial decree.&lt;ref name="kane" /&gt;&lt;ref name="consent1922"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1922|title=Consent Decrees|url=|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=22|issue=4|pages=344-348|doi=10.2307/1111304|issn=0010-1958|jstor=1111304|ref={{harvid|Consent Decrees|1922}}|via=|jstor-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schwarzschild | first=Maimon | date=1 November 1984 | title=Public Law by Private Bargain: Title VII Consent Decrees and the Fairness of Negotiated Institutional Reform | url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2890&amp;context=dlj | journal=Duke Law Journal | volume=33 | issue=5 | pages=887-936 | issn=0012-7086 | ref=harv | }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Isenbergh|Rubin|1940|pp=388–389}} In many cases, the request for entry of a consent decree prompts judges to sign the documents presented then and there.&lt;ref name="resnik2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In some cases, however, such as [[Criminal case|criminal cases]], the judge must make some sort of assessments before the court’s entry of the agreement as a consent decree.&lt;ref name="resnik2015" /&gt;

The usual consent decree is not self-executing.&lt;ref name=consent1922 /&gt; A consent decree is implemented when the parties transform their agreements from paper to reality.&lt;ref name="resnik2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kane" /&gt;{{sfn|Isenbergh|Rubin|1940|p=392}} The judge who signed the decree may have no involvement or may monitor the implementation.&lt;ref name="resnik2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The judge can only step in to assist in enforcement if a party complains to the court that an opponent has failed to perform as agreed.&lt;ref name="resnik2015" /&gt; In this case, the offending party would be committed for [[contempt of court|contempt]].&lt;ref name=consent1922 /&gt;

Decrees by consent are more [[Legally binding|binding]] than those issued ''in invitum'', or against an unwilling party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=in invitum | encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in+invitum | accessdate=6 April 2014 | }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are subject to modification by the same court, and reversal by higher courts.&lt;ref name=consent1922 /&gt; The decree issued by consent cannot be modified, except by consent.

Typically, a consent decree dispenses with the necessity of having proof in court, since by definition the defendant agrees to the order. Thus, the use of a consent decree is not a sentence or admission of guilt.&lt;ref name=consent1922 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Civil Procedure: In a Nutshell | last=Kane | first=Mary Kay | publisher=West | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-314-06641-1 | edition=4th | location=St. Paul, Minnesota | oclc=611673986 | ref=harv | }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Isenbergh|Rubin|1940|p=387}} Likewise, the consent decree prevents a [[finding of facts]], so the decree cannot be pleaded as ''[[res judicata|res adjudicata]]''.&lt;ref name="kane" /&gt;&lt;ref name=consent1922 /&gt;{{sfn|Isenbergh|Rubin|1940|p=394}}

==History==
Because judicial decrees are part of government civil enforcement in settlements that two parties typically agree to before [[litigation]] is filed, they act as a hybrid between a [[judicial order]] and a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] without a party conceding criminal responsibility.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | title=Procedural and Institutional Norms in Antitrust Enforcement: The U.S. System | last1=First | first1=Harry | last2=Fox | first2=Eleanor M. | date=20 July 2012 | publisher=Social Science Research Network | location=Rochester, NY | last3=Hemli | first3=Daniel E. | |ssrn=2115886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick Pollock and Frederic Maitland describe how courts during the twelfth century of [[Medieval Europe]] used "fines" as a form of court orders to settle land disputes among litigants with the punitive power and legitimacy of courts through the use of consent decree.&lt;ref name="resnik2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo1.ark:/13960/t5bc4jc23;view=1up;seq=9 | title=The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I | last1=Pollock | first1=Frederick | last2=Maitland | first2=Frederic William | publisher=University Press | year=1899 | volume=2 | location=Cambridge | oclc=919797536 | ref=harv | }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, 19th and 20th century legal treatises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Treatise on the Law of Judgments | last1=Freeman | first1=A.

===Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure===
The [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] and the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]], which both went into effect in 1938,&lt;ref name="resnik2015" /&gt; lay many of the legal foundations that govern the use of consent decree.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tobias | first=Carl | date=1 January 1989 | title=Public Law Litigation and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure | url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3405&amp;context=clr | journal=Cornell Law Review | volume=74 | issue=2 | pages=270 | issn=0010-8847 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Chayes | first=Abram | title=The Role of the Judge in Public Law Litigation | journal=Harvard Law Review | volume=89 | issue=7 | pages=1281 | doi=10.2307/1340256 | jstor=1340256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating space for courts, which are important actors in implementing a consent decree, to enter into a settlement, [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure#Title IV – Parties|Rule 23]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23 | title=Rule 23.

===Precedents===
Many of the early court cases involving consent decree set precedents for the roles that judges would play in the negotiating, approving, interpreting, and modifying a settlement between two parties.&lt;ref name="resnik2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=west /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Sfn|Ziko|1994|p=243}} The role of the judge in regard to consent decree wavers between "rubber stamping" versus applying their own judgments to a proposed settlement.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Anderson | first=Lloyd C. | year=1996 | title=United States v.

{{ussc|name=Pacific Railroad of Missouri v. Ketchum|volume=111|page=505|pin=|year=1884}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to antitrust decrees, the first consent decree used in antitrust regulation under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] was ''[[Swift &amp; Co. v. United States]]''.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{ussc|name=Swift &amp; Co. v.

United States]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that a consent decree could be modified or terminated only when new developments over time bring out a "grievous wrong" in how the ruling of the consent decree affects the parties of the suit.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book|title=Antitrust Consent Decrees in Theory and Practice: Why Less Is More|last=Epstein|first=Richard A.|publisher=AEI Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8447-4250-2|location=Washington, DC|pages=|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Supreme Court supported this limited flexibility of consent decrees in ''[[United States v.

In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled in ''United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.'', that to promote finality, a court's changes to consent a decree should be rare—but the courts can modify a consent decree or frame [[injunction|injunctive]] relief to ensure the litigation achieves its purpose.&lt;ref name=mengler1987 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.|volume=391|page=244|pin=|year=1968 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Before a judge can enter a consent decree, according to the rulings in ''Firefighters v.

In ''Firefighters v. City of Cleveland'', the Supreme Court ruled that consent decrees "have attributes both of contracts and of judicial decrees", so consent decrees should be treated differently for different purposes.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In ''Rufo v.

===Structural reform===

====School desegregation====
 
The effort to [[Desegregation|desegregate]] American public schools began in 1954 with ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. This [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] Supreme Court case established that racial segregation of children in public schools was in violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which requires that states must not "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Brown v. Board of Education|volume=347|page=483|pin=495|year=1954}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To properly enforce this legislation, the Supreme Court allowed district courts to use desegregation decrees obligating states to actively transition into racially nondiscriminatory school systems, with "all deliberate speed".&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Brown v. Board of Education|volume=349|page=294|pin=295|year=1954}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the original decree did not include specific ways this could be done, beginning with ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' in 1971, the Supreme Court specifically defined the objective as eliminating "all vestiges of state imposed segregation"&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|volume=402|page=1|pin=15|year=1971}}.
{{Cite court|litigants=|court=|reporter=U.S.|vol=|pinpoint=15|date=|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/402/1/case.html#15}}&lt;/ref&gt; within school systems, including the limited use of [[Desegregation busing|busing]],&lt;ref&gt;''Swann'', 402 U.S. at 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Preston Cary|date=1999|title=Can State Constitutional Provisions Eliminate De Facto Segregation in the Public Schools?|journal=The Journal of Negro Education|volume=68|issue=2|pages=138-153|doi=10.2307/2668121|issn=0022-2984|jstor=2668121|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[racial quota]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Swann'', 402 U.S. at 22–25.&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of [[magnet school]]s and judicial placement of new schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=G.

County School Board of New Kent County|volume=391|page=430|pin=|year=1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ruling—which include, student assignment, faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Green'', 391 U.S. at 435.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Baradaran-Robinson|2003|p=1346}}

====Police use of violence====
Consent decrees have been signed by a number of cities concerning their police departments' use of force policies and practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2015/11/13/forced-reforms-mixed-results/|title=Forced Reforms, Mixed Results|last1=Kelly|first1=Kimbriell|date=November 13, 2015|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 10, 2016|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Childress|first2=Sarah|last3=Rich|first3=Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[New Orleans]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public law===
Consent decrees have been used to remedy various social issues that deal with public and private organizations, where a large number of people are often concerned even if they may not be members of either party involved.{{Sfn|Schwarzschild|1984|p=887}} Examples have included [[Title VII]], the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], and environmental safety provisions.

====Actions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964====

[[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII]] prohibits discrimination by employers on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or national origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|2000e-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, the remedies to workplace discrimination carried out under this Act take place in the form of consent decrees, where employers may have to provide monetary awards or introduce policies and programs that eliminate and prevent future discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/employees/remedies.cfm|title=Remedies for Employment Discrimination|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ending Sex and Race Discrimination in the Workplace: Legal Interventions That Push the Envelope|last1=Hegewisch|first1=Ariane|last2=Deitch|first2=Cynthia H.|last3=Murphy|first3=Evelyn F.|publisher=Institute for Women's Policy Research|year=2011|isbn=978-1-933161-06-8|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may include decrees that require the creation of new recruitment and hiring procedures to gain a more diverse pool of job applicants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Bockman, et al. and EEOC v.

====Americans with Disabilities Act====

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was a civil rights law passed in 1990 that prohibits discrimination and ensures that people with disabilities have equal access to the opportunities and benefits available to the wider American population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ada.gov/ada_intro.htm|title=Introduction to the ADA|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12112}}, {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12113}}, and {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions that violate the requirements of the ADA enter consent decrees typically resulting in a payment from the corporation to those wronged, which may serve to discourage future discrimination, in addition to a change in policy to avoid future payouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=ADA Settlements and Consent Agreements | work=Americans with Disabilities Act | publisher=United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division| url=http://www.ada.gov/settlemt.htm | accessdate=2014-04-21 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140721061207/http://www.ada.gov/settlemt.htm | archivedate=2014-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of altered practices through the use of a decree have included restructuring building property&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Justice Department Reaches Agreement with Hilton Worldwide Inc.

====Environmental law====

Consent decrees have been used to alter environmental policy, one example being the "Flannery Decision", or the Toxics Consent Decree, entered into by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], an environmental advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Natural_Resources_Defense_Council_v._Train/Opinion_of_the_Court|Natural Resources Defense Council v. Train]], No. 74 Civ. 4617 (S.D.N.Y., March 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; This decree, signed in 1976, highly restructured the way the EPA dealt with harmful substances by requiring the agency to list and regulate 65 toxic pollutants and to regulate harmful substances on an industry-by-industry basis rather than by singular pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trussell|first=R.

==Effects==
Scholars find advantages and disadvantages to using the consent decree.{{sfn|Isenbergh|Rubin|1940|p=386}}{{sfn|Mengler|1987|p=294}}{{sfn|Resnik|2015|p=85}} In addition, consent decrees can affect those outside of the litigants, such as third parties and [[public interest]]s.{{Sfn|Epstein|2007|p=4}}{{Sfn|Dabney|1963|p=1053}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fieweger|first=Michael|date=1 January 1993|title=Consent Decrees in Prison and Jail Reform--Relaxed Standard of Review for Government Motions to Modify Consent Decrees|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6766&amp;context=jclc|journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology|volume=83|issue=4|pages=1024–1054|ref=harv|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages and disadvantages===
The following are advantages of using consent decrees:
* Save financial costs of [[litigation]]: Consent decrees forgo a [[court trial]] that allows for both parties and the courts to save [[legal expense]]s.{{Sfn|Fieweger|1993|p=1025}}{{Sfn|Consent Decrees|1922|pp=345–346}}{{Sfn|Epstein|2007|p=4}}{{Sfn|Baradaran-Robinson|2003|p=1340}}{{sfn|Isenbergh|Rubin|1940|p=387}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Keating | first=Gregory C. | title=Settling through Consent Decree in Prison Reform Litigation: Exploring the Effects of Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail | journal=Boston College Law Review | ref=harv | date=1992 | pages=163–201 | url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1967&amp;context=bclr | volume=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Save the time of prolonged litigation: The parties and the courts save the time it would take for a court trial to occur{{Sfn|Baradaran-Robinson|2003|p=1340}} and the courts more quickly clear their [[Docket (court)|dockets]].{{sfn|Resnik|2015|p=67}}{{sfn|Keating|1992|p=164}}
* Ability to get results of a [[trial]]: The parties are able to obtain similar results of a court trial, specifically where a change is required to appease the dispute.{{sfn|Resnik|2015|p=63}}{{sfn|Isenbergh|Rubin|1940|pp=387, 405}}
* Parties avoid the uncertainties of a trial: Consent decrees forgo a trial and its unknown outcome, the necessity of [[legal burden of proof|proof]], and any [[guilt (law)|guilt]] is taken for granted (because no one is accused by the consent decree).{{Sfn|Fieweger|1993|p=1025}}{{Sfn|Consent Decrees|1922|pp=345–346}}{{sfn|Resnik|2015|p=63}}{{Sfn|Baradaran-Robinson|2003|p=1340}}{{sfn|Isenbergh|Rubin|1940|p=387}}{{sfn|Keating|1992|p=164}}
* Parties have control of the remedial plan: Consent decrees allow both parties to have greater latitude in deciding how to remedy their issues.{{Sfn|Fieweger|1993|p=1025}}{{Sfn|Epstein|2007|p=4}}{{Sfn|Baradaran-Robinson|2003|pp=1339–1340}}{{sfn|Keating|1992|p=164}} This is an advantage "because the parties, not the court, determine the remedy, [and] the assumption is that the remedy is better suited to the parties' needs."{{sfn|Resnik|2015|p=64}}
*More compliance and authoritativeness: Both parties more voluntarily implement their agreements if obtained by consent than by force.{{sfn|Resnik|2015|pp=63–64}}{{sfn|Keating|1992|p=191}} Moreover, to fail to act under the consent decree seems to be more a [[Infraction|violation]] of the "[[law]]" than if under a [[contract]] because the parties are "bound" and not "[[Obligation (law)|obligated]]" by the consent decree.{{sfn|Resnik|2015|pp=63–64}}{{sfn|Mengler|1987|p=292}} Its authoritativeness is reinforced by the practice that a return to court for a consent decree has a priority in the court queue.{{sfn|Resnik|2015|pp=63–64}}
*Sustained [[judicial oversight]] and [[judicial interpretation|interpretation]]: Courts can supervise that consent decrees are upheld for an indefinite period of time.{{Sfn|Baradaran-Robinson|2003|p=1338}}{{Sfn|Epstein|2007|p=6}}{{sfn|Keating|1992|p=164}}

In contrast, the following are disadvantages of using consent decrees:
*Duration: Some argue that "consent decrees often last for too long a period."{{Sfn|Epstein|2007|p=6}} Although consent decrees are a solution to a particular issue, the context around that issue or the issue itself may change.{{Sfn|Epstein|2007|p=6}}{{sfn|Keating|1992|p=167}}{{Sfn|Fieweger|1993|p=1025}} However, the consent decree is neither as easy to modify nor adapt and thus can become inadequate.{{Sfn|Epstein|2007|p=6}}{{sfn|Keating|1992|p=167}}
*Ambition: Consent decrees can be an avenue for those seeking to enact a future-oriented change that is more general and not case-specific.{{Sfn|Epstein|2007|p=6}}{{sfn|Isenbergh|Rubin|1940|p=408}}{{sfn|Keating|1992|pp=164, 187}} Consent decrees are thus used "as a tool of enforcement [that is] less expensive, and sometimes more far-reaching, than [[adjudication]],"{{sfn|Resnik|2015|p=67}} especially in [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] cases and those involving [[public institution (United States)|public institutions]].{{Sfn|Epstein|2007|p=6}}{{sfn|Isenbergh|Rubin|1940|p=407}}
*Complexity: Consent decrees can be complex in questions of modification, either before{{sfn|Isenbergh|Rubin|1940|p=409}} or after{{Sfn|Epstein|2007|p=6}}{{sfn|Keating|1992|p=167}} it is enacted: "the decree issued by consent cannot be modified, except by consent. Only where the consent has been obtained by fraud or given by mistake will a bill be entertained to set it aside."{{Sfn|Consent Decrees|1922|p=346}}
*Ambiguity: There is ambiguity in the source of power of the consent decree,{{sfn|Resnik|2015|p=54}} the role of judges,{{sfn|Isenbergh|Rubin|1940|p=407}} and the guidelines for a consent decree.{{sfn|Resnik|2015|p=54}} Some see that "neither [[judge]]s, [[lawyer]]s, nor [[party (law)|parties]] know exactly what they give or get when a consent decree is entered...[which may bear] testimony to the negative consequences of the ambiguity that surrounds consent decrees."{{sfn|Resnik|2015|p=62}}

===Third parties and public interests===
The consent decree can impact those outside of the [[party (law)|parties]], who resolve their disputes with a consent decree, especially in settling [[public institution (United States)|institutional]] reform and [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] cases.{{Sfn|Fieweger|1993|p=1025}}{{Sfn|Stedman|1965|p=647}}{{sfn|Keating|1992|pp=186–187}} From ''[[Rufo v. Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail]]''&lt;ref name=rufo /&gt; and ''[[Swift and Company v. United States|Swift &amp; Co. v. United States]]'',&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] acknowledges that "the effects of the decree on [[third-party beneficiary|third parties]] and the [[public interest]] should be taken into account when determining whether or not a change in fact warrants... the decree."{{Sfn|Fieweger|1993|p=1024}}{{sfn|Keating|1992|p=191}} There is criticism that "the antitrust consent decree is an opaque form of [[government regulation]] that operates without many of the [[checks and balances]] that constrain and shape ordinary [[regulatory agency|regulatory]] programs."{{Sfn|Epstein|2007|p=vii}} So, some argue that the use of consent decrees in [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] cases and with [[public institution (United States)|public institutions]] can negatively affect [[third-party beneficiary|third parties]] and [[public interest]]s.{{Sfn|Stedman|1965|p=629}}{{sfn|Isenbergh|Rubin|1940|pp=407, 409}}{{sfn|Keating|1992|p=165, 187}}{{sfn|Mengler|1987|p=292}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9338">'''Conversation theory''' is a [[cybernetic]] and [[dialectic]] framework that offers a scientific theory to explain how interactions lead to "construction of knowledge", or "knowing": wishing to preserve both the dynamic/kinetic quality, and the necessity for there to be a "knower".&lt;ref&gt;Pask, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; This work was proposed by [[Gordon Pask]] in the 1970s.

== Overview ==
Conversation theory  regards [[social system]]s as symbolic, language-oriented systems where responses depend on one person's interpretation of another person's behavior, and where meanings are agreed through [[conversation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;(Pask 1975, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; But since meanings are agreed, and the agreements can be illusory and transient, [[scientific research]] requires stable reference points in [[human]] transactions to allow for reproducible results. Pask found these points to be the understandings which arise in the conversations between two participating individuals, and which he defined rigorously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehope.org/convtheo.htm Conversation Theory developed by the cybernetician Gordon Pask] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000523132501/http://thehope.org/convtheo.htm |date=2000-05-23 }} in ''Realizing the heavenly Jerusalem'', Yitzhak I. Hayut, March 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversation theory describes interaction between two or more cognitive systems, such as a [[teacher]] and a [[student]] or distinct perspectives within one individual, and how they engage in a dialog over a given concept and identify differences in how they understand it.

Conversation theory came out of the work of [[Gordon Pask]] on instructional design and models of individual learning styles. In regard to learning styles, he identified conditions required for concept sharing and described the [[learning styles]] ''holist'', ''serialist'', and their optimal mixture ''versatile''. He proposed a rigorous model of analogy relations.

== Topics ==
Conversation theory as developed by Pask originated from this cybernetics framework and attempts to explain learning in both living organisms and machines.  The fundamental idea of the theory was that learning occurs through conversations about a subject matter which serves to make knowledge explicit.

=== Levels of conversation ===
Conversations can be conducted at a number of different levels:&lt;ref name="Cortland"&gt;[http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Pask.htm Conversation Theory – Gordon Pask] overview from web.cortland.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Natural language (general discussion)
* Object languages (for discussing the subject matter)
* Metalanguages (for talking about learning/language)

=== Conversation ===
Through recursive interactions called "conversation" their differences may be reduced until agreement—that is, agreement up to a point which Pask called "agreement over an understanding"—may be reached. A residue of the interaction may be captured as an "entailment mesh", an organized and publicly available collection of resultant knowledge, itself a major product of the theory as devotees argue they afford many advantages over [[semantic networks]] and other, less formalized and non-experimentally based "representations of knowledge".

Lastly, a formal analogy is shown where the derivations of the concept triples are indicated. The diamond shape denotes analogy and can exist between any three topics because of the shared meanings and differences.
[[File:analogy.png|none|Analogy]]

The relation of one topic to another by an analogy can also be seen as a restriction on a mapping and a distinction to produce the second topic or concept.

=== Cognitive Reflector ===
From conversation theory, Pask developed what he called a "Cognitive Reflector". This is a virtual machine for selecting and executing concepts or topics from an entailment mesh shared by at least a pair of participants. It features an external modelling facility on which agreement between, say, a teacher and pupil may be shown by reproducing public descriptions of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;See Pask 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; We see this in essay and report writing or the "practicals" of science teaching.

Lp was Pask's protolanguage which produced operators like '''Ap''' which concurrently executes '''Con''', the concept of a Topic, '''T''', to produce a Description,  '''D'''. Thus:

'''Ap(Con(T)) =&gt; D(T)''',  where '''=&gt;''' stands for '''produces'''.

A succinct account of these operators is presented in Pask&lt;ref name="Pask 1996"&gt;Gordon Pask, ''Heinz von Foerster's Self-Organisation, the Progenitor of Conversation and Interaction Theories'', 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst many insights he points out that three indexes are required for concurrent execution, two for parallel and one to designate a serial process. He subsumes this complexity by designating participants A, B, etc.

In Commentary toward the end of Pask,&lt;ref name="Pask 1996"/&gt; he states:

: The form not the content of the theories (conversation theory and interactions of actors theory) return to and is congruent with the forms of physical theories; such as wave particle duality (the set theoretic unfoldment part of conversation theory is a radiation and its reception is the interpretation by the recipient of the descriptions so exchanged, and vice versa). The particle aspect is the recompilation by the listener of what a speaker is saying. Theories of many universes, one at least for each participant A and one to participant B- are bridged by analogy. As before this is the ''[[truth value]] of any interaction; the metaphor for which is culture itself''.

=== Learning strategies ===
In order to facilitate learning, Pask argued that subject matter should be represented in the form of  structures which show what is to be learned.  These structures exist in a variety of different levels depending upon the extent of the relationships displayed.  The critical method of learning according to Conversation Theory is "teachback" in which one person teaches another what they have learned.&lt;ref name="Cortland"/&gt;

Pask identified two different types of learning strategies:&lt;ref name="Cortland"/&gt;
* Serialists – Progress through a structure in a sequential fashion
* Holists – Look for higher order relations

The ideal is the versatile learner who is neither vacuous holist "globe trotter" nor serialist who knows little of the context of his work.

[[Manuscript]] H.5.6, held at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], contains a [[poem]] of 24 [[stanza]]s apparently written by Mac Con Midhe for Toirealach Ó Néill of Sliocht Airt Óig of Tyrone and his wife, Sorcha. It survives in another copy of 188 lines in MS 1291 (formerly H.1.17), also in Trinity, both being made by Hugh O'Daly in the middle 18th century for a Dr. Sullivan. According to Ó Diobhlin (2000), "Because of the corruptness of the copy the poem has never been edited, nor have its contents been deciphered ... Toirealach was transplanted to Connacht, and then he disappears from history after the [[Jacobite rebellion]]."

{{Nazism sidebar|expanded=Related}}
'''Denazification''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Entnazifizierung}}) was an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] initiative to rid German and Austrian [[society]], [[culture]], [[News media|press]], [[economy]], [[judiciary]], and [[politics]] of the National Socialist ideology ([[Nazism]]). It was carried out by removing those who had been [[Nazi Party]] or [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members  from positions of power and influence and by disbanding or rendering impotent the organizations associated with Nazism. The program of denazification was launched after the end of the [[Second World War]] and was solidified by the [[Potsdam Agreement]].

The term ''denazification'' was first coined as a legal term in 1943 in [[the Pentagon]], intended to be applied in a narrow sense with reference to the post-war German legal system. Soon afterward, it took on the more general meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Frederick |date=2011 |title=Exorcising Hitler: The Occupation and Denazification of Germany |url= |location= |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |pages=253–4 |isbn=978-1408822128 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very soon after the program started, due to the emergence of the [[Cold War]], the western powers and the United States in particular began to lose interest in the program, and it was carried out in an increasingly lenient and lukewarm way until being officially abolished in 1951. The American government soon came to view the program as ineffective and counterproductive. Additionally, the program was hugely unpopular in Germany and was opposed by the new West German government of [[Konrad Adenauer]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Overview==
[[File:Amtsdokument Paul Fischer 1948 Zivilist Entlastungs-Zeugnis Clearance Certificate Entnazifizierungsausschuß Stadtkreis Wattenscheid.jpg|thumb|A 1948 [[Denazification certificate|denazification clearance certificate]] from [[Wattenscheid]] in the British Zone.]]

Denazification in Germany was attempted through a series of directives issued by the [[Allied Control Council]], seated in [[Berlin]], beginning in January 1946. "Denazification directives" identified specific people and groups and outlined judicial procedures and guidelines for handling them. Though all the occupying forces had agreed on the initiative, the methods used for denazification and the intensity with which they were applied differed between the occupation zones.

The term "denazification" also refers to the removal of the physical symbols of the Nazi regime. For example, in 1957 the West German government re-issued World War II [[Iron Cross]] medals, among other decorations, without the [[swastika]] in the center.

About 8.5 million Germans, or 10% of the population, had been members of the Nazi Party. Nazi-related organizations also had huge memberships, such as the [[German Labour Front]] (25 million), the [[National Socialist People's Welfare]] organization (17 million), the [[National Socialist Women's League|League of German Women]], [[Hitler Youth]], the Doctors' League, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; It was through the Party and these organizations that the Nazi state was run, involving as many as 45 million Germans in total.&lt;ref name="Taylor, p. 255"&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Nazism found significant support among industrialists, who produced weapons or used slave labour, and large landowners, especially the [[Junker (Prussia)|Junker]]s in Prussia.  Denazification after the surrender of Germany was thus an enormous undertaking, fraught with many difficulties.

The first difficulty was the enormous number of Germans who might have to be first investigated, then penalized if found to have supported the Nazi state to an unacceptable degree. In the early months of denazification there was a great desire to be utterly thorough, to investigate every suspect and hold every supporter of Nazism accountable; however, it turned out that the numbers simply made this goal impractical. It soon became evident, further, that pursuing denazification too scrupulously would make it impossible to create a functioning, economically-efficient democratic society in Germany. Enforcing the strictest sanctions against lesser offenders would prevent too many talented people from participating in the reconstruction process. The [[Morgenthau Plan]] had recommended that the Allies create a post-war Germany with all its industrial capacity destroyed, reduced to a level of subsistence farming; however, that plan was soon abandoned as unrealistic and, because of its excessive punitive measures, liable to give rise to German anger and aggressiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), pp. 119–123.&lt;/ref&gt; As time went on, another consideration that moderated the denazification effort in the West was the concern to keep enough good will of the German population to prevent the growth of communism.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), pp. 97–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The denazification process was often completely disregarded by both the Soviets and the Western powers for German rocket scientists and other technical experts, who were taken out of Germany to work on projects in the victor's own country or simply seized in order to prevent the other side from taking them. The U.S. took 785 scientists and engineers from Germany to the United States, some of whom formed the backbone of the U.S. space program (see [[Operation Paperclip]]).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), pp. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the top-ranking Nazis, such as [[Hermann Göring|Göring]], [[Rudolf Hess|Hess]], [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|von Ribbentrop]], [[Julius Streicher|Streicher]], and [[Albert Speer|Speer]], the initial proposal by the British was to simply arrest them and shoot them,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; but that course of action was replaced by putting them on trial for war crimes at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] in order to publicize their crimes while demonstrating that the trials and the sentences were just, especially to the German people. However, the legal foundations of the trials were questioned, and most Germans were not convinced that the trials were anything more than "[[victors' justice]]".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:98-animate.gif|right|thumb|A swastika at the [[Nazi party rally grounds]] being demolished with explosives, as part of the denazification initiative.]]
Many refugees from Nazism were Germans and Austrians, and some had fought for Britain in the Second World War. Some were transferred into the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] and sent back to Germany and Austria in British uniform. However, German-speakers were small in number in the British zone, which was hampered by the language deficit. Due to its large [[German-American]] population, the U.S. authorities were able to bring a larger number of German-speakers to the task of working in the [[Allied Military Government]], although many were poorly trained.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), pp. 300, 267.&lt;/ref&gt; They were assigned to all aspects of military administration, the interrogation of [[POW]]s, collecting evidence for the War Crimes Investigation Unit and the search for [[war criminal]]s.

The [[Morgenthau plan#JCS 1067|Joint Chiefs of Staff Directive 1067]] directed [[U.S. Army]] General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s policy of denazification. A report of the [[Institute on Re-education of the Axis Countries]] in June 1945 recommended: "Only an inflexible long-term occupation authority will be able to lead the Germans to a fundamental revision of their recent political philosophy." The [[United States military]] pursued denazification in a zealous, albeit bureaucratic, fashion, especially during the first months of the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; It had been agreed among the Allies that denazification would begin by requiring Germans to fill out a questionnaire ({{lang-de|link=no|Fragebogen}}) about their activities and memberships during the Third Reich. Five categories were established: ''Major Offenders'', ''Offenders'', ''Lesser Offenders'', ''Followers'', and ''Exonerated Persons''. The Americans, unlike the British, French, and Soviets, interpreted this to apply to every German over the age of eighteen in their zone.&lt;ref name="Adam, pg 274"&gt;Adam, pg 274&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower initially estimated that the denazification process would take 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eisenhower Claims 50 Years Needed to Re-Educate Nazis |author= Norgaard, Noland.|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1206197/eisenhower_50_years_for_denazification/|newspaper=The Oregon Statesman|date=October 13, 1945|page=2|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 9, 2014 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the nearly complete list of Nazi Party memberships was turned over to the Allies (by a German anti-Nazi who had rescued it from destruction in April 1945 as American troops advanced on Munich), it became possible to verify claims about participation or non-participation in the Party.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), pp. 249–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1.5 million Germans who had joined before Hitler came to power were deemed to be hard-core Nazis.&lt;ref name="Taylor, p. 255"/&gt;

Progress was slowed by the overwhelming numbers of Germans to be processed, but also by difficulties such as incompatible power systems and power outages, with the  [[Tabulating machine|Hollerith IBM data machine]] that held the American vetting list in Paris. As many as 40,000 forms could arrive in a single day to await processing. By December 1945, even though a full 500,000 forms had been processed, there remained a backlog of 4,000,000 forms from POWs and a potential case load of 7,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), pp. 261–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Fragebögen'' were, of course, filled out in German. The number of Americans working on denazification was inadequate to handle the workload, partly as a result of the demand in the U.S. by families to have soldiers returned home.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Replacements were mostly unskilled and poorly trained.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there was too much work to be done to complete the process of denazification by 1947, the year American troops were expected to be completely withdrawn from Europe.

Pressure also came from the need to find Germans to run their own country. In January 1946 a directive came from the Control Council entitled "Removal from Office and from Positions of Responsibility of Nazis and Persons Hostile to Allied Purposes". One of the punishments for Nazi involvement was to be barred from public office and/or restricted to manual labour or "simple work". At the end of 1945, 3.5 million former Nazis awaited classification, many of them barred from work in the meantime.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the winter of 1945–46, 42% of public officials had been dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; Malnutrition was widespread, and the economy needed leaders and workers to help clear away debris, rebuild infrastructure, and get foreign exchange to buy food and other essential resources.&lt;ref name="Taylor, p. 255"/&gt;

Another concern leading to the Americans relinquishing responsibility for denazification and handing it over to the Germans arose from the fact that many of the American denazifiers were German Jews, former refugees returning to administer justice against the tormentors and killers of their relatives. It was felt, both among Germans and top American officials, that their objectivity might be contaminated by a desire for revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), pp. 271–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these various pressures, and following a 15 January 1946 report of the Military Government decrying the efficiency of denazification, saying, "The present procedure fails in practice to reach a substantial number of persons who supported or assisted the Nazis", it was decided to involve Germans in the process. In March 1946 the Law for Liberation from National Socialism and Militarism ({{lang-de|link=no|Befreiungsgesetz}}) came into effect, turning over responsibility for denazification to the Germans.&lt;ref name="Junker, pg 68"&gt;Junker, pg 68&lt;/ref&gt; Each zone had a Minister of Denazification. On 1 April 1946, a special law  established 545 civilian tribunals under German administration ({{lang-de|link=no|Spruchkammern}}), with a staff of 22,000 of mostly lay judges, enough, perhaps, to start to work but too many for all the staff themselves to be thoroughly investigated and cleared.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; They had a case load of 900,000. Several new regulations came into effect in the setting up of the German-run tribunals, including the idea that the aim of denazification was now rehabilitation rather than merely punishment, and that someone whose guilt might meet the formal criteria could also have their specific actions taken into consideration for mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiency thus improved, while rigor declined.

Many people had to fill in a new background form, called a ''Meldebogen'' (replacing the widely disliked ''Fragebogen''), and were given over to justice under a ''Spruchkammer'',&lt;ref name="Adam, pg 274" /&gt; which assigned them to one of five categories:&lt;ref name="Junker, pg 68"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam, pg 275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Control Council Directive No. 38, Articles 7–13 (October 12, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

* V. Persons Exonerated ({{lang-de|link=no|Entlastete}}). No sanctions.
* IV. Followers ({{lang-de|link=no|[[Mitläufer]]}}). Possible restrictions on travel, employment, political rights, plus fines.
* III. Lesser Offenders ({{lang-de|link=no|Minderbelastete}}). Placed on probation for 2–3 years with a list of restrictions. No internment.
* II. Offenders: Activists, Militants, and Profiteers, or Incriminated Persons ({{lang-de|link=no|Belastete}}). Subject to immediate arrest and   imprisonment up to ten years performing reparation or reconstruction work plus a list of other restrictions.
* I. Major Offenders ({{lang-de|link=no|Hauptschuldige}}). Subject to immediate arrest, death, imprisonment with or without hard labour, plus a list of lesser sanctions.

Again because the caseload was impossibly large, the German tribunals began to look for ways to speed up the process. Unless their crimes were serious, members of the Nazi Party born after 1919 were exempted on the grounds that they had been [[Mind_control|brainwashed]]. Disabled veterans were also exempted. To avoid the necessity of a slow trial in open court, which was required for those belonging to the most serious categories, more than 90% of cases were judged not to belong to the serious categories and therefore were dealt with more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; More "efficiencies" followed. The tribunals accepted statements from other people regarding the accused's involvement in National Socialism. These statements earned the nickname of ''[[Persilschein]]e'', after advertisements for the laundry and whitening detergent [[Persil]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam, pg 275. Also see Katrin Himmler's book "The Brothers Himmler", about the Himmler family&lt;/ref&gt; There was corruption in the system, with Nazis buying and selling denazification certificates on the black market. Nazis who were found guilty were often punished with fines assessed in [[Reichsmark]]s, which had become nearly worthless.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; In Bavaria the Denazification Minister, Anton Pfeiffer, bridled under the "victor's justice", and presided over a system that reinstated 75% of officials the Americans had dismissed and reclassified 60% of senior Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; The denazification process lost a great deal of credibility, and there was often local hostility against Germans who helped administer the tribunals.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1947, the Allies held 90,000 Nazis in [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]]; another 1,900,000 were forbidden to work as anything but manual labourers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=4&amp;documentid=24&amp;documentdate=1947-02-28&amp;studycollectionid=mp&amp;nav=OK Herbert Hoover's press release of The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria, Report No. 1: German Agriculture and Food Requirements], February 28, 1947. pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1948, the [[Cold War]] was clearly in progress and the US began to worry more about a threat from the [[Eastern Bloc]] rather than the latent Nazism within occupied Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining cases were tried through summary proceedings that left insufficient time to thoroughly investigate the accused, so that many of the judgments of this period have questionable judicial value. For example, by 1952 members of the [[SS]] like [[Otto Skorzeny]] could be declared formally denazified ({{lang-de|link=no|entnazifiziert}}) [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] by a German government arbitration board and without any proof that this was true. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The delicate task of distinguishing those truly complicit in or responsible for Nazi activities from mere "followers" made the work of the courts yet more difficult. US President [[Harry S. Truman]] alluded to this problem: "though all Germans might not be guilty for the war, it would be too difficult to try to single out for better treatment those who had nothing to do with the Nazi regime and its crimes."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bela Vardy and T.

Contemporary American critics of denazification denounced it as a "counterproductive [[witch hunt]]" and a failure; in 1951 the provisional West German government granted amnesties to lesser offenders and ended the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_11_02_03_payne.pdf|author= JAMES L.

====Censorship====
While judicial efforts were handed over to German authorities, the US Army continued its efforts to denazify Germany through control of German media. The [[Information Control Division]] of the US Army had by July 1946 taken control of 37 German newspapers, six radio stations, 314 theaters, 642 cinemas, 101 magazines, 237 book publishers, and 7,384 book dealers and printers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psywarrior.com/mcclure.html McClure article]&lt;/ref&gt; Its main mission was democratization but part of the agenda was also the prohibition of any criticism of the Allied occupation forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-4/lochner2.html Lochner interview]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, on May 13, 1946, the Allied Control Council issued a directive for the confiscation of all media that could contribute to Nazism or [[militarism]]. As a consequence a list was drawn up of over 30,000 book titles, ranging from school textbooks to poetry, which were then banned. All copies of books on the list were confiscated and destroyed; the possession of a book on the list was made a punishable offense. All the millions of copies of these books were to be confiscated and destroyed. The representative of the Military Directorate admitted that the order was in principle no different from the [[Nazi book burnings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,776847,00.html Read No Evil] [[Time magazine]], May 27, 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

The censorship in the U.S. zone was regulated by the occupation directive [[JCS 1067]] (valid until July 1947) and in the May 1946 order valid for all zones (rescinded in 1950), Allied Control Authority Order No. 4, "No. 4 – Confiscation of Literature and Material of a Nazi and Militarist Nature". All confiscated literature was reduced to pulp instead of burning.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Note: In August 1946 the order was amended so that "In the interest of research and scholarship, the Zone Commanders (in Berlin the Komendantura) may preserve a limited number of documents prohibited in paragraph 1. These documents will be kept in special accommodation where they may be used by German scholars and other German persons who have received permission to do so from the Allies only under strict supervision by the Allied Control Authority."&lt;/ref&gt; It was also directed by Directive No. 30, "Liquidation of German Military and Nazi Memorials and Museums". An exception was made for tombstones "erected at the places where members of regular formations died on the field of battle".

Artworks were under the same censorship as other media:
{{quote|all collections of works of art related or dedicated to the perpetuation of German militarism or Nazism will be closed permanently and taken into custody.}}
The directives were very broadly interpreted, leading to the destruction of thousands of paintings and thousands more were shipped to deposits in the U.S. Those confiscated paintings still surviving in U.S. custody include for example a painting "depicting a couple of middle aged women talking in a sunlit street in a small town".&lt;ref name="URL at Wayback machine"&gt;Cora Goldstein "PURGES, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITS: ART POLICIES IN GERMANY 1933–1949, {{cite web |url=http://culturalpolicy.uchicago.edu/workshop/goldstein.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223153732/http://culturalpolicy.uchicago.edu/workshop/goldstein.html |archivedate=December 23, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists were also restricted in which new art they were allowed to create; "[[OMGUS]] was setting explicit political limits on art and representation".&lt;ref name="URL at Wayback machine"/&gt;

The publication ''Der Ruf'' (''The Call'') was a popular [[literary magazine]] first published in 1945 by [[Alfred Andersch]] and edited by [[Hans Werner Richter]]. ''Der Ruf'', also called ''Independent Pages of the New Generation'', claimed to have the aim of educating the German people about democracy. In 1947 its publication was blocked by the American forces for being overly critical of occupational government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richter attempted to print many of the controversial pieces in a volume entitled ''[[Der Skorpion]]'' (''The Scorpion''). The occupational government blocked publication of ''Der Skorpion'' before it began, saying that the volume was too "nihilistic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Publication of ''Der Ruf'' resumed in 1948 under a new publisher, but ''Der Skorpion'' was blocked and not widely distributed. Unable to publish his works, Richter founded [[Group 47]].

The Allied costs for occupation were charged to the German people. A newspaper which revealed the charges (including, among other things, thirty thousand [[bra]]s) was banned by the occupation authorities for revealing this information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=47&amp;articleID=599 Did the United States Create Democracy in Germany?] the [[Independent Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet zone===

From the beginning, denazification in the Soviet zone was considered a critical element of the transformation into a socialist society and was quickly and effectively put into practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Entnazifizierung und Personalpolitik in der sowjetischen Besatzungszone Köthen/Anhalt.

Köln 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NKVD]] was directly in charge of this process, and oversaw the camps. In 1948, the camps were placed under the same administration as the [[gulag]] in the Soviet government. According to official records, 122,600 people were interned. 34,700 of those interned in this process were considered to be Soviet citizens, with the rest being German.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Speziallager Nr. 2 1945–1950.

Because part of the intended goal of denazification in the Soviet zone was also the removal of anti-socialist sentiment, the committees in charge of the process were politically skewed. A typical panel would have one member from the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union,]] one from the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]], three from the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], and three from political mass organizations (who were typically also supportive of the Socialist Unity Party).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Entnazifizierung in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: Herrschaft und Verwaltung 1945–1948|last=van Mells|first=Damian|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=3-486-56390-4|location=|pages=208|trans-title=Denazification in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: Rule and Administration 1945-1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Former Nazi officials quickly realized that they would face fewer obstacles and investigations in the zones controlled by the Western Allies. Many of them saw a chance to defect to the West on the pretext of [[anti-communism]].&lt;ref name="RG"&gt;Ralph Giordano ''Die zweite Schuld.'' Köln 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions in the internment camps were terrible, and between 42,000 and 80,000 prisoners died. When the camps were closed in 1950, prisoners were handed over to the [[East Germany|East German]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Entnazifizierung, Politische Säuberung unter alliierter Herrschaft.|last=Vollnhals|first=Clemens|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=3-492-12056-3|location=Munich|pages=377|trans-title=Denazification, Political cleansing under Allied administration|translation=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before denazification was officially abandoned in [[West Germany]], East German propaganda frequently portrayed itself as the only true anti-fascist state, and argued that the West German state was simply a continuation of the Nazi regime, employing the same officials that had administered the government during the Nazi dictatorship. These accusations would be vindicated, as during the 1950s many former functionaries of Nazi regime were employed in positions in the West German government. However, East German propaganda also attempted to denounce as Nazis even politicians like [[Kurt Schumacher]], who had been imprisoned by the Nazi regime himself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Der große Plan - Alltag und Herrschaft in der DDR 1949–1961|last=Wolle|first=Stefan|publisher=Christoph Links Verlag|year=2013|isbn=978-3-86153-738-0|location=|pages=205-207|trans-title=The Greatest Plan: Everyday life and governance in the GDR 1949-1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such allegations appeared frequently in the official [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] newspaper, the ''[[Neues Deutschland]]''. The [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|riots of 17 June 1953]] in Berlin were officially blamed on Nazi ''[[agents provocateurs]]'' from [[West Berlin]], who the ''Neues Deutschland'' alleged were then working in collaboration with the Western government with the ultimate aim of restoring Nazi rule throughout Germany. The [[Berlin Wall]] was officially called the Anti-Fascist Security Wall ({{lang-de|link=no|Antifaschistischer Schutzwall}}) by the East German government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/rare-east-german-photographs-the-other-side-of-the-berlin-wall-a-774232.html|title=Rare East German Photographs: The Other Side of the Berlin Wall|year=2011|publisher=Spiegel Online|accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all former Nazis faced judgment. Doing special tasks for the Soviet government could protect Nazi members from prosecution, enabling them to continue working.&lt;ref name="Zitat1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Demokratisierung durch Entnazifizierung und Erziehung|last=Benz|first=Wolfgang|publisher=bpb|year=2005|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kai Cornelius, ''Vom spurlosen Verschwindenlassen zur Benachrichtigungspflicht bei Festnahmen'', BWV Verlag, 2004, pp.126ff, {{ISBN|3-8305-1165-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having special connections with the occupiers in order to have someone vouch for them could also shield a person from the denazification laws.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the districts of [[Gera]], [[Erfurt]], and [[Suhl]] had significant amounts of former Nazi Party members in their government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===British zone===
[[File:KAS-Entnazifizierung-Bild-5866-1.jpg|thumb|right|A poster from the [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] state elections 1947, with the slogan "For a quick and just denazification vote [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]"]]

The British prepared a plan from 1942 onwards, assigning a number of quite junior civil servants to head the administration of liberated territory in the rear of the Armies, with draconian powers to remove from their post, in both public and private domains, anyone suspected, usually on behavioural grounds, of harbouring Nazi sympathies. For the British government, the rebuilding of German economic power was more important than the imprisonment of Nazi criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wierskalla |

In October 1945, in order to constitute a working legal system, and given that 90% of German lawyers had been members of the Nazi Party, the British decided that 50% of the German Legal Civil Service could be staffed by "nominal" Nazis. Similar pressures caused them to relax the restriction even further in April 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; In industry, especially in the economically crucial Ruhr area, the British began by being lenient about who owned or operated businesses, turning stricter by autumn of 1945. In order to reduce the power of industrialists, the British expanded the role of trade unions, giving them some decision-making powers.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), pp. 307–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were, however, especially zealous during the early months of occupation in bringing to justice anyone, soldiers or civilians, who committed war crimes against POWs or captured Allied aircrew.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), pp. 293–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1945 an
[[Bad Nenndorf interrogation centre|interrogation centre at Bad Nenndorf]] was opened, where ex-Nazis and suspected communist agents were tortured with beatings, whippings, thumb-screws, cold, starvation, etc. A public scandal ensued but only one person was found guilty of neglect.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British to some extent avoided being overwhelmed by the potential numbers of denazification investigations by requiring that no one need fill out the ''Fragebogen'' unless they were applying for an official or responsible position. This difference between American and British policy was decried by the Americans and caused some Nazis to seek shelter in the British zone.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), pp. 302–3, 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1946, the British handed over their denazification panels to the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

===French zone===
The French were less vigorous, for a number of reasons, than the other Western powers, not even using the term "denazification", instead calling it "épuration" (purification). They did not view it as critical to distinguish Nazis from non-Nazis, since in their eyes Germans were all to blame. At the same time, some French occupational commanders had served in the collaborationist [[Vichy regime]] during the war where they had formed friendly relationships with Germans. As a result, in the French zone mere membership in the Nazi party was much less important than in the other zones.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), pp. 317–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because teachers had been strongly Nazified, the French began by removing three-quarters of all teachers from their jobs. However, finding that the schools could not be run without them, they were soon rehired, although subject to easy dismissal. A similar process governed technical experts.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; The French were the first to turn over the vetting process to Germans, while maintaining French power to reverse any German decision. Overall, the business of denazification in the French zone was considered a "golden mean between an excessive degree of severity and an inadequate standard of leniency", laying the groundwork for an enduring reconciliation between France and Germany. In the French zone only thirteen Germans were categorized as "major offenders".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2011), p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany in the 21st century===

In 2017, the German [[Public Prosecutor General (Germany)|Federal Prosecutor's Office]] investigated a German Army Lieutenant known as "[[Franco A.]]" allegedly a right-wing extremist accused by the authorities to have been involved in a conspiracy to carry out a serious violent acts that endangered state security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Spiegel staff | title=Fall Franco A.: Ermittler finden Anleitung zum Bombenbau - Politik | website=Spiegel Online | date=12 May 2017a |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/franco-a-ermittler-finden-bombenbau-anleitung-a-1147341.html |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the case the German Defence Minister [[Ursula von der Leyen]] said "When [Franco A.] master's thesis says that immigration leads to the genetic genocide of Western peoples, then it should be crystal clear to everyone that we are dealing with Nazi ideas". After her ministry has issued a report on the incidents detailing examples of soldiers performing the Nazi salute and racially abusing service members from minority backgrounds; she stated in April 2017 that the ministry would make significant changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Bailey |first2=Carlo |last2=Angerer |title=German Military Faces Overhaul in Wake of Far-Right Scandals |website=NBC News |date=23 April 2018 |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/german-military-faces-overhaul-wake-far-right-scandals-n758246}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2017, the [[German Ministry of Defence]] (''Bundesministerium der Verteidigung'') halted the publication of an Army (''[[Bundeswehr]]'') songbook that included some songs from the Nazi period such as ''[[Panzerlied]]'' and stated that "As part of the critical and sensitive handling of the content it was recognized that some passages no longer correspond to our values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Spiegel staff |title="Schwarzbraun ist die Haselnuss": Ministerium stoppt Bundeswehr-Liederbuch - Politik |website=Spiegle Online |date=12 May 2017b |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/verteidigungsministerium-stoppt-bundeswehr-liederbuch-a-1147482.html |language=de |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ministry denied it stating that the review had been initiated months before, the magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' linked this action to the investigation to the Franco A. case.{{sfn|Spiegel staff|2017b}}

==Brown book==
In 1965, the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front of the German Democratic Republic]] published what became known as the ''Brown Book: War and Nazi Criminals in West Germany: State, Economy, Administration, Army, Justice, Science''. As the title would indicate, the presence of former Gestapo members in the ''[[Volkspolizei]]'' and ex-Nazis at all levels of the Socialist Unity Party was not covered. The book, among other things, mentioned 1,800 names of former Nazis who held positions of authority in West Germany. These included 15 ministers and deputy ministers, 100 generals and admirals of the armed forces, 828 senior judges and prosecutors, 245 leading members of the Foreign Ministry, embassies and consulates officials, and 297 senior police officers and [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] officials. The listing was inaccurate; many of the military names had not been Party members, as the armed forces did not permit its officers to join, while many low level Party members in other groups were overlooked altogether. As revealed by [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] official Dieter Senk in 1989, "today we know that [the] Brown Book didn't contain even approximately all the relevant names&amp;nbsp;... For example it mentions only 3 names from the BKA". &lt;ref&gt;Dieter Schenk, ''Auf dem rechten Auge blind. Die braunen Wurzeln des BKA'' (Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsck, Köln 2001), p 289&lt;/ref&gt; The book had a controversial impact in West Germany. Reflecting this, a judge ordered the seizure of the volume from the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ditfurth | first = Jutta | title = Ulrike Meinhof: Die Biography | publisher = Ullstein | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-550-08728-8 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}} pp 274–275 (Greek version)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

===For future German states===
The culture of denazification strongly influenced the parliamentary council charged with drawing up a constitution for those occupation zones that would become West Germany.

This Constitution ({{lang-de|link=no|Grundgesetz}}, Basic Law) was completed on May 8, 1949, ratified on May 23, and came into effect the next day. This date effectively marks the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany.

===For the future of Europe===
The end of denazification saw the ''ad hoc'' creation initially of the Western Union (not to be confused with [[Western Union|the commercial operation of that name]]) which would be institutionalised as the [[Western European Union]] in 1947 and 1955, with a broad socio-economic remit actually implemented in the strict domain of arms control.&lt;ref&gt;Treaty of Brussels 11.5.1955&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility and collective guilt==
[[File:Namering exhumed bodies of SS murdered slave workers ww2-183.jpg|thumb|right|After the defeat of Nazi Germany, German civilians were sometimes forced to tour concentration camps and in some cases to exhume mass graves of Nazi victims.]]
[[File:Eure Schuld.jpg|thumb|right|Diese Schandtaten: Eure Schuld! ("These atrocities: your fault!") One of the posters distributed by U.S. occupation authorities in the summer of 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey K. Olick, "In the house of the hangman: the agonies of German defeat, 1943–1949",
 p. 98, footnote 12([https://books.google.com/books?id=eBzJvmrOSL0C&amp;pg=PA98 books google])&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The ideas of [[collective guilt]] and [[collective punishment]] originated not with the US and British people, but on higher policy levels.&lt;ref name="Francis R. Nicosia pp. 130, 131"&gt;Francis R. Nicosia,Jonathan Huener (Eds.) "Business and industry in Nazi Germany", Berghan Books, 2004: pp. 130,131&lt;/ref&gt; Not until late in the war did the U.S. public assign collective responsibility to the German people.&lt;ref name="Francis R. Nicosia pp. 130, 131"/&gt; The most notable policy document containing elements of collective guilt and collective punishment is [[JCS 1067]] from early 1945.&lt;ref name="Francis R. Nicosia pp. 130, 131"/&gt; Eventually horrific footage from the concentration camps would serve to harden public opinion and bring it more in line with that of policymakers.&lt;ref name="Francis R. Nicosia pp. 130, 131"/&gt;

Already in 1944, prominent U.S. opinion makers had initiated a domestic propaganda campaign (which was to continue until 1948) arguing for a harsh peace for Germany, with a particular aim to end the apparent habit in the U.S. of viewing the Nazis and the German people as separate entities.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Casey, (2005), The Campaign to sell a harsh peace for Germany to the American public, 1944–1948, [online]. London: LSE Research Online. [Available online at http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/archive/00000736] Originally published in History, 90 (297). pp. 62–92 (2005) Blackwell Publishing, "Indeed, in 1944 their main motive for launching a propaganda campaign was to try to put an end to the persistent American habit 'of setting the Nazis apart from the German people{{'"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Statements made by the British and U.S. governments, both before and immediately after Germany's [[Surrender (military)|surrender]], indicate that the German nation as a whole was to be held [[moral responsibility|responsible]] for the actions of the Nazi regime, often using the terms "collective guilt" and "[[collective responsibility]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FiyHJ8MiR1gC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=collective+responsibility+german&amp;sig=NHnIn8bNfr_WYo4F_AZ2Gea0cc0#PPA262,M1 Balfour, pg 264]&lt;/ref&gt;

To that end, as the Allies began their post-war denazification efforts, the [[Psychological Warfare Division]] (PWD) of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] undertook a psychological propaganda [[Political campaign|campaign]] for the purpose of developing a German sense of collective responsibility.&lt;ref name="janowitz1946"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2770938 Janowitz, 1946]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Public Relations and Information Services Control Group of the [[Control Commission for Germany – British Element|British Element (CCG/BE)]] of the [[Allied Commission|Allied Control Commission for Germany]] began in 1945 to issue directives to officers in charge of producing newspapers and radio broadcasts for the German population to emphasize "the moral responsibility of all Germans for Nazi crimes".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FiyHJ8MiR1gC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=collective+responsibility+german&amp;sig=NHnIn8bNfr_WYo4F_AZ2Gea0cc0#PPA263,M1 Balfour, pg 263]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, among U.S. authorities, such a sense of collective guilt was "considered a prerequisite to any long-term education of the German people".&lt;ref name="janowitz1946" /&gt;

Using the German press, which was under Allied control, as well as posters and pamphlets, a program was conducted to acquaint ordinary Germans with what had taken place in the concentration camps. For example, using posters with images of concentration camp victims coupled to text such as "YOU ARE GUILTY OF THIS!"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WOD9ncsixssC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22You+are+guilty!!%22+Dachau&amp;sig=ACfU3U3kdP54-NrK_ypCOHQH5Bxm9168AQ Marcuse pg 61]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj77/maitles.htm Book Review] of ''[[Hitler's Willing Executioners]]''&lt;/ref&gt; or "These atrocities: your fault!"&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Eric Voegelin, Brenden Purcell "Hitler and the Germans", Footnote 12, p. 5 "In the summer of 1945, the Allies publicly displayed horrifying posters and reports from the Dachau and Belsen concentratrion camps with the accusatory headline 'Diese Schandtaten: Eure Schuld!'

[[File:NaziConcentrationCamp.gif|thumb|right|U.S. Army soldiers show the German civilians of [[Weimar]] the corpses found in [[Buchenwald concentration camp]].]]
A number of films showing the concentration camps were made and screened to the German public, such as ''[[Death Mills|Die Todesmühlen]]'', released in the U.S. zone in January 1946, and ''[[Welt im Film No. 5]]'' in June 1945. A film that was never finished due partly to delays and the existence of the other films was ''[[German Concentration Camps Factual Survey|Memory of the Camps]]''. According to Sidney Bernstein, chief of PWD, the object of the film was:

{{quote|...To shake and humiliate the Germans and prove to them beyond any possible challenge that these German crimes against humanity were committed and that the German people – and not just the Nazis and SS – bore responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/camp/faqs.html PBS Story]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Delays led to the decision that the approach to the film was not as good as other extant films, and the footage and unread script were shelved.&lt;ref&gt;In 1985, PBS' ''Frontline'' showed ''Memory of the Camps'' on the 40th anniversary of the liberation. ''Frontline:Memory of the Camps'' [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/camp/faqs.html Frequently Asked Questions]. PBS. Accessed July 23, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the reason the film was scrapped was that the harsh attitudes toward Germans had changed. Initially the denazification had a more harsh goal. English writer [[James Stern]] recounted an example in a German town soon after the German surrender.

Immediately upon the liberation of the concentration camps, many German civilians were forced to see the conditions in the camps, bury rotting corpses and exhume mass graves.&lt;ref name="marcuse_p128"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WOD9ncsixssC&amp;pg=RA2-PA427&amp;dq=vansittartist&amp;sig=9VDocDT8Lu1S9ij9RXl-DgH9gZw#PRA1-PA128,M1 Marcuse, pg 128]&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, civilians were also made to provide items for former concentration camp inmates.&lt;ref name="marcuse_p128" /&gt;

==Surveys==
The U.S. conducted opinion surveys in the American zone of occupied Germany.&lt;ref name=Judt58&gt;{{cite|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aU8laRbSvrMC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=%22Nazism+was+a+good+idea,+badly+applied%22&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEu4KN6t7aAhWlI8AKHQbrD8EQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nazism%20was%20a%20good%20idea%2C%20badly%20applied%22&amp;f=false |page=58|last1=Judt|first1=Tony|title=Postwar: a History of Europe since 1945|publisher=Pimlico|date=2007|isbn=1446418022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Judt, in his book ''Postwar: a History of Europe since 1945'', extracted and used some of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomhull.com/ocston/books/judt-postwar.php Judt Book Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712090627/http://www.tomhull.com/ocston/books/judt-postwar.php |date=July 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A majority in the years 1945–49 stated National Socialism to have been a good idea but badly applied.&lt;ref name=Judt58/&gt;
* In 1946, 6% of Germans said the [[Nuremberg trials]] had been unfair.&lt;ref name=Judt58/&gt;
* In 1946, 37% in the US occupation zone said about the Holocaust that "the extermination of the Jews and Poles and other non-Aryans was necessary for the security of Germans".&lt;ref name=Judt58/&gt;
* In 1946, 1 in 3 in the US occupation zone said that Jews should not have the same rights as those belonging to the Aryan race.&lt;ref name=Judt58/&gt;

* In 1952, 37% said Germany was better off without the Jews on its territory.&lt;ref name=Judt58/&gt;
* In 1952, 25% had a good opinion of Hitler.&lt;ref name=Judt58/&gt;

British historian [[Ian Kershaw]] in his book ''The "Hitler Myth": Image and Reality in the Third Reich''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Kershaw|title=The "Hitler Myth": Image and Reality in the Third Reich|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192802062|pp=264-66}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes about the various surveys carried out at the German population:
* In 1945, 42% of young Germans and 22% of adult Germans thought that the reconstruction of Germany would be best applied by a 'strong new Führer'.
* In 1952, 10% of Germans thought that Hitler was the greatest statesman and that his greatness would only be realised at a later date and 22% thought he had made 'some mistakes' but was still an excellent leader.
* In 1952, roughly 33% opposed the assassination attempt of Hitler in the [[20 July plot]] in 1944.
* In 1953, 14% of Germans said they would vote for someone like Hitler again.

However, in ''Hitler, Germans, and the "Jewish Question"'', Sarah Ann Gordon notes the difficulty of drawing conclusions from the surveys. For example, respondents were given three alternatives from which to choose, as in question 1:
{| class="wikitable" border="1" style="margin-left:5px;"
|-
! Statement !! Percentage agreeing
|-
| Hitler was right in his treatment of the Jews:||0%
|-
| Hitler went too far in his treatment of the Jews, but something had to be done to keep them in bounds:||19%
|-
| The actions against the Jews were in no way justified:||77%
|}

To the question of whether an Aryan who marries a Jew should be condemned, 91% responded "No". To the question of whether "All those who ordered the murder of civilians or participated in the murdering should be made to stand trial", 94% responded "Yes".&lt;ref name=gordon2&gt;{{cite book | last = Gordon | first =Sarah Ann | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Hitler, Germans, and the 'Jewish Question | publisher =Princeton University Press | date = March 1, 1984| location = | pages = 202–205 | url = | doi = | isbn =0-691-10162-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon singles out the question "Extermination of the Jews and Poles and other non-Aryans was not necessary for the security of the Germans", which included an implicit double negative to which the response was either yes or no. She concludes that this question was confusingly phrased (given that in the German language the affirmative answer to a question containing a negative statement is "no"): "Some interviewees may have responded 'no' they did not agree with the statement, when they actually did agree that the extermination was not necessary."&lt;ref name=gordon&gt;{{cite book | last = Gordon | first =Sarah Ann | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Hitler, Germans, and the 'Jewish Question | publisher =Princeton University Press | date = March 1, 1984| location = | pages =199–200 | url = | doi = | isbn =0-691-10162-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She further highlights the discrepancy between the antisemitic implications of the survey results (such as those later identified by Judt) with the 77% percent of interviewees who responded that actions against Jews were in no way justified.&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt;

Gordon states that if the 77 percent result is to be believed then an "overwhelming majority" of Germans disapproved of extermination, and if the 37 percent result is believed to be correct then over one third of Germans were willing to exterminate Poles and Jews and others for German security.&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt; She concludes that the phrasing of the question on German security lowers the confidence in the latter interpretation.&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt;

Gordon follows this with another survey where interviewees were asked if Nazism was good or bad (53% chose bad) and reasons for their answer. Among the nine possible choices on why it was bad, 21% chose the effects on the German people before the war, while 3–4 percent chose the answer "race policy, atrocities, pogroms".&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt; However, Gordon highlights the issue that it is difficult to pin down at which point in time respondents became aware of the exterminations, before or after they were interviewed: questionnaire reports indicate that a significant minority had no knowledge until the Nuremberg trials.

She also notes that when confronted with the exterminations there was an element of denial, disbelief, and confusion. Asked about concentration camps, very few Germans associated them with the Jews, leading to the conclusion that they did not understand how they had been used against the Jews during the war and instead continued to think of them as they were before the war, the place where political opponents to the Nazis were kept. "This naivete is only understandable if large numbers of Germans were truly ignorant of the existence of these camps".&lt;ref name=gordon3&gt;{{cite book | last = Gordon | first =Sarah Ann | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Hitler, Germans, and the "Jewish Question" | publisher =Princeton University Press | date = March 1, 1984| location = | pages =201–208 | url = | doi = | isbn =0-691-10162-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A British study on the same attitudes concluded that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who said National Socialism was a good idea pointed to social welfare plans, the lack of unemployment, the great construction plans of the Nazis&amp;nbsp;... Nearly all those who thought it a good idea nevertheless rejected Nazi racial theories and disagreed with the inhumanity of the concentration camps and the 'SS'.&lt;ref name=gordon3/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sarah Gordon writes that a majority of Germans appeared to approve of nonviolent removal of Jews from civil service and professions and German life.&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt; The German public also accepted the Nuremberg laws because they thought they would act as stabilizers and end violence against Jews.&lt;ref name=gordon3/&gt; The German public had as a result of the Nazi antisemitic propaganda hardened their attitudes between 1935 and 1938 from the originally favorable stance. By 1938, the propaganda had taken effect and antisemitic policies were accepted, provided no violence was involved.&lt;ref name=gordon3/&gt; [[Kristallnacht]] caused German opposition to antisemitism to peak, with the vast majority of Germans rejecting the violence and destruction, and many Germans aiding the Jews.&lt;ref name=gordon3/&gt;

The Nazis responded by intimidation in order to discourage opposition, those aiding Jews being victims of large-scale arrests and intimidation.&lt;ref name=gordon3/&gt; With the start of the war the anti-Semitic minority that approved of restrictions on Jewish domestic activities was growing, but there is no evidence that the general public had any acceptance for labor camps or extermination.&lt;ref name=gordon3/&gt; As the number of antisemites grew, so too did the number of Germans opposed to racial persecution, and rumors of deportations and shootings in the east led to snowballing criticism of the Nazis. Gordon states that "one can probably conclude that labor camps, concentration camps, and extermination were opposed by a majority of Germans".&lt;ref name=gordon3/&gt;

Gordon concludes in her analysis on German public opinion based German SD-reports during the war and the Allied questionnaires during the occupation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;it would appear that a majority of Germans supported elimination of Jews from the civil service; quotas on Jews in professions, academic institutions, and commercial fields; restrictions on intermarriage; and voluntary emigration of Jews. However, the rabid antisemites' demands for violent boycotts, illegal expropriation, destruction of Jewish property, pogroms, deportation, and extermination were probably rejected by a majority of Germans. They apparently wanted to restrict Jewish rights substantially, but not to annihilate Jews.&lt;ref name=gordon3/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==End==
The West German political system, as it emerged from the occupation, was increasingly opposed to the Allied denazification policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frei |first=Norbert |date=1996 |title=Vergangenheitspolitik: Die Anfänge der Bundesrepublik und die NS-Vergangenheit |url= |location= |publisher=C.H.Beck |isbn=978-3-406-63661-5 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As denazification was deemed ineffective and counterproductive by the Americans, they did not oppose the plans of the West German chancellor, [[Konrad Adenauer]], to end the denazification efforts. Adenauer's intention was to switch government policy to reparations and compensation for the victims of Nazi rule                           (''[[Wiedergutmachung]]''), stating that the main culprits had been prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Steinweis |editor1-first=Alan E. |editor2-last=Rogers |editor2-first=Daniel E. |date=2003 |title=The Impact of Nazism: New Perspectives on the Third Reich and Its Legacy |url= |location= |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |page=235 |isbn=978-0803222397 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 several laws were passed, ending the denazification. Officials were allowed to retake jobs in the civil service, with the exception of people assigned to Group I (Major Offenders) and II (Offenders) during the denazification review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Art  |first=David  |date=2005 |title=The Politics of the Nazi Past in Germany and Austria |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=53–55 |isbn=978-0521673242 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgbl.de/Xaver/media.xav?SID=anonymous3113862832518&amp;tocf=Bundesanzeiger_BGBl_tocFrame&amp;tf=Bundesanzeiger_BGBl_mainFrame&amp;qmf=Bundesanzeiger_BGBl_mainFrame&amp;hlf=Bundesanzeiger_BGBl_mainFrame&amp;bk=Bundesanzeiger_BGBl&amp;name=bgbl/Bundesgesetzblatt%20Teil%20I/1951/Nr.%2022%20vom%2013.05.1951/bgbl151s0307.pdf ''Gesetz zur Regelung der Rechtsverhältnisse der unter Artikel 131 des Grundgesetzes fallenden Personen'' – 11 May 1951 (Bundesgesetzblatt I 22/1951, p. 307 ff.)] {{Dead link |date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several amnesty laws were also passed which affected about 792,176 people. Those pardoned included people with six-month sentences, 35,000 people with sentences of up to one year and include more than 3,000 functionaries of the SA, the SS, and the Nazi Party who participated in dragging victims to jails and camps; 20,000 other Nazis sentenced for "deeds against life" (presumably murder); 30,000 sentenced for causing bodily injury, and 5,200 who committed "crimes and misdemeanors in office".&lt;ref name="TNR"&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/article/amnesty-and-amnesia Amnesty and Amnesia(Adenauer's Germany and the Nazi Past: The Politics of Amnesty and Integration by Norbert Frei) review by Jeffrey Herf The New Republic 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many people with a former Nazi past ended up again in the political apparatus of Western Germany.

==Hiding one's Nazi past==
Membership in Nazi organizations is still not an open topic of discussion. In the 1980s former UN Secretary General and President of Austria [[Kurt Waldheim]] was confronted with allegations he had lied about his wartime record in the Balkans. 

It was not until 2006 that famous German writer [[Günter Grass]], often viewed as a spokesman of "the nation's moral conscience", spoke publicly about the fact that he had been a member of the [[Waffen SS]] (even though his involvement appears to have been less than criminal; he was conscripted into the Waffen SS while barely seventeen years old and his duties were strictly military in nature). Statistically it is likely that there are many more Germans of Grass's generation (also called the "[[Flakhelfer]]-Generation") with biographies similar to his.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mut-gegen-rechte-gewalt.de/artikel.php?id=1&amp;kat=91&amp;artikelid=3504 Karen Margolis: ''Who wasn't a Nazi?'']{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), on the other hand, has been open about his membership at the age of fourteen in [[Hitler Youth]], when his church youth group was forced to merge with them.

==In other countries==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2011}}
In practice, denazification was not limited to Germany and Austria; in every European country with a vigorous Nazi or Fascist party, measures of denazification were carried out. In France the process was called [[épuration légale]] (''legal cleansing''). [[Prisoners of war]] held in [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]] in Allied countries were also subject to denazification qualifications before their [[repatriation]].

Denazification was also practised in many countries which came under German occupation, including Belgium, Norway, Greece and [[Yugoslavia]], because satellite regimes had been established in these countries with the support of local collaborators.

In Greece, for instance, [[Special Courts of Collaborators]] were created after 1945 to try former collaborators. The three Greek "[[quisling]]" prime ministers were convicted and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] or [[life imprisonment]]. Other Greek collaborators after German withdrawal underwent repression and public humiliation, besides being tried (mostly on treason charges). In the context of the emerging [[Greek Civil War]] however, most wartime figures from the civil service, the [[Greek Gendarmerie]] and the notorious [[Security Battalions]] were quickly integrated into the strongly anti-Communist postwar establishment.

An attempt to ban the [[swastika]] across the EU in early 2005 failed after objections from the British government and others. In early 2007, while Germany held the European Union presidency, Berlin proposed that the European Union should follow German Criminal Law and criminalize the [[Holocaust denial|denial of the Holocaust]] and the display of Nazi symbols including the swastika, which is based on the Ban on the Symbols of Unconstitutional Organizations Act (see [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a]]). This led to an opposition campaign by Hindu groups across Europe against a ban on the swastika. They pointed out that the swastika has been around for 5,000 years as a symbol of peace.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6269627.stm Hindus opposing EU swastika ban], [[BBC]] online, 17 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff (source dgs/[[Reuters]])[http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,460259,00.html Hindus Against Proposed EU Swastika Ban] [[Der Spiegel]] online, 17 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal to ban the swastika was dropped by Berlin from the proposed [[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union wide anti-racism laws]] on 29 January 2007.&lt;ref name=EthanMcNern&gt;Ethan McNern.

==Decommunization==
In part inspired by the idea behind denazification, several central and eastern European countries have adopted policies following the [[revolutions of 1989]] aimed at dismantling the legacies of the communist state establishments, culture, and psychology, and to some extent to punish communist perpetrators, referred to as [[decommunization]].

Speakers of Dulong are generally in all domains and all ages with positive attitudes. Dulong is closely related to the [[Rawang language|Rawang]] language of [[Myanmar]] (Burma).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sino-Tibetan languages|last=Thurgood|first=Graham|last2=LaPolla|first2=Randy J.|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0-203-27573-X|location=Abingdon, Oxon|pages=674–682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although almost all ethnic [[Derung people]] speak the language to some degree, most are multilingual, also speaking [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Lisu language|Lisu]], and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] Chinese&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; except for a few very elderly people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perlin|first=Ross|date=April 2009|title=Language Attitudes of the T'rung|url=http://www.himalayanlanguages.org/files/perlin/03-Perlin-Dulong-Attitudes.pdf|journal=Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area|volume=32.1|pages=91–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Dulong belongs to the [[Nungish languages|Nungish]] language family of the Central Tibeto-Burman branch of the Tibeto-Burman branch of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language family.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/duu|title=Drung|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two languages in the same family are [[Anong]] and [[Rawang language|Rawang]].

==History==
Dulong/Rawang is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken on both sides of the China/Myanmar (Burma) border just south and east of Tibet. Within Myanmar, the people who speak the Dulong language (possibly up to 100,000 people) live in northern [[Kachin State]], particularly along the Mae Hka ('[[N'Mai River|Nmai Hka]]) and Mach Hka ([[Mali River|Mali Hka]]) River valleys. In the past, they had been called 'Hkanung' or 'Nung', and have often been considered to be a subgroup of the Kachm ([[Jingpho language|Jinghpaw]]). Around 2000, speakers of this language in Myanmar have begun a movement to use the name /rəwɑŋ/ (spelled 'Rvwang' in the [[Rawang language|Rawang]] orthographies) to represent all of its speakers. The speakers in China, though, continue to use the name 'Dulong'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LaPolla|first=Randy J.|date=2000|title=Valency-changing derivations in Dulong/Rawang|url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/randylapolla/papers/LaPolla_2000_Valency-changing_Derivations_in_Dulong_Rawang.pdf|journal=Changing Valency: Case Studies in Transitivity, ed. by R. M. W. Dixon &amp; Alexandra Y. Aikhcnvald. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press|volume=|pages=282–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
There are 14,000 (2,000 census) people speaking in two dialects: 8,500 in [[Salween River|Nu River]] dialect, and 5,500 in Dulong River dialect. The locations of Dulong are [[Yunnan]] province (Gongshan Dulong-Nu autonomous county), [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Xizang Autonomous Region]] (Gongshan Dulong-Nu autonomous county west to Chayu (Zayü) county), [[Gongshan Derung and Nu Autonomous County|Gongshan county]], Bingzhongluo, and [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] (Chayu county, Chawalong district).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the past, the Dulong River was known as the Kiu (Qiu) river, and the Dulong people were known as the Kiu (Qiu), Kiutze (Qiuzi), Kiupa, or Kiao.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Dialects/varieties===
Dulong has two dialects: Dulong River (Central Dulongjiang, Derung River, Northern Dulongjiang, Southern Dulongjiang), and [[Salween River|Nu River]] (Nujiang Dulong). Dialects reportedly inherently intelligible (Thurgood and LaPolla 2003). Other possible dialect names are Melam, Metu, Tamalu, and Tukiumu.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Sounds/phonology==
===Consonants===
Dulong has twenty-four [[Consonant mutation|initial consonants]] at six points of articulation, plus the [[consonant cluster]]s /pr, br, mr, kr, xr, gr, pl, bl, ml, kl, gl/ in initial position; only the consonants /p, t, ʔ, k, n, m, ŋ, r, l/ occur in final position.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Vowels===
Dulong has seven vowels, /i, ε, ə, ɑ, ɔ, ɯ, u/, and three [[diphthong]]s, /əi, ɑi, ɯi/, which only appear in open syllables.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Tones===
Dulong has 3 [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]]: high level, high falling, and low falling. In the Dulong language, tone has the role of differentiating the meaning of a few words, with about 8% words (out of about 4000) completely relying on tones to distinguish them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dúlóngyǔ jiǎnzhì (A sketch of the Dulong language)|last=Sun|first=Hongkai|publisher=Minzu Chubanshe|year=1982|location=Beijing|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
Words can be formed by [[prefix]]ation, [[suffix]]ation, or [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]]. Word classes include nouns, defined by the ability to appear with a numeral classifier; verbs, defined by the ability to appear with negation and the person and tense marking; postpositions, which are enclitic to NPs, numerals, and classifiers. Adjectives are a subset of [[stative verb]]s for which reduplication means intensification or adverbialization rather than the perfective aspect (reduplication with nouns has a distributive meaning, ‘every’). Adjectives can be used as [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]] or can appear nominalized in a copula clause.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Vocabulary/Lexis==
Lexical similarity: 74% with Matwang dialect of [[Rawang language|Rawang]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Domingo Patricio Meagher''' (1703–1772), known as the Father Meagher (Aita Meagher in Basque) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] Jesuit priest, university professor and writer of Irish descent. He was born in [[San Sebastian, Spain]] on March 17, 1703 and died in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] on September 21, 1772. His father was an [[Irish people|Irish]] merchant, who had settled in the [[Basque people|Basque]] city.

==Biography==
At 14, he and his brother Daniel joined the [[Society of Jesus]]. In 1736 he went on to profess the Society's vows in [[San Sebastián|San Sebastian]]. He became a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Santiago de Compostela|University of Santiago]] and professor of theology at the universities of [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]] and [[University of Valladolid|Valladolid]]. He eventually returned to the Jesuit community in his hometown. Following the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767]] he went into exile along with his companions, dying a few years later, on September 21, 1772, in [[Florence]] at 69 years of age. In his hometown, [[San Sebastián|San Sebastian]], a square, the Father Meagher/Aita Meagher Plaza was dedicated to his memory in 1994.

==Works==

===Literary works===
Besides teaching, Father Meagher also produced prose and poetry. There is evidence that he produced various writings but most of them were lost following the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767]] which involved the loss of many of the company's writings. Among his works the following are cited:
*Poems about the [[canonization]] of Saint [[Aloysius Gonzaga]] and Saint [[Stanislaus Kostka]] in 1726.
*Satirical verses on Friar Gerund of Campazas, fictional character created by [[José Francisco de Isla|Father Isla]] in 1758.
*A funeral elegy of [[Barbara de Braganza]], queen consort of King [[Ferdinand VI of Spain]], who died in 1758.
*Writings in defense against several defamatory books against the [[Jesuits]], published in [[France]] between 1760 and 1761.
*Briefs on various issues which occurred in the 17th century.

;One of Meagher's verses
:''Gizon bat ardo gabe''
:''Dago erdi hila''
:''Marmar dabiltzak tripak''
:''Ardoaren bila''
:''Baina edan ezkero''
:''Ardoa txit ongi''
:''Gizonik txatarrenak''
:''Balio ditu bi''

;Translation
:''A man without wine''
:''is half dead''
:''the guts go growling''
:''looking for wine''
:''But once drank''
:''wine is very good''
:''the man most useless''
:''sorry for the two''

==The Basque language==
Father Meagher managed to fill a small gap in the history of [[Basque language|Basque]] literature, having preserved the language in several poems written in [[Basque language|Basque]]. These managed to retain its popularity and were transcribed in songbooks and magazines during the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth.

It is told that Meagher, recovering from an illness, was taking wine as a  prescription to relieve his ailments. Meagher was able to recover from the illness and, grateful for the relief he had found in wine, wrote some verses in which he praised the qualities of wine. Meagher's poems in Basque all deal with the same theme, for this they can be described as Basque poetry:
*''Ardo zarraren kantak seikotan'' - (Songs about old wine in sextets).
*''Ardoa o Ni naiz txit gauza goxoa '' - ( Wine or I'm a very sweet thing).
*''Erroman eta Parisen o Matsaren zumua'' - (In Rome and Paris or Grape juice).
*''Ardoari, Zortziokoa ardoari o Gizon bar ardo bage'' - ( Wine, an Octet to wine or A man without wine).

{{short description|Times of year when all movies released are of lower quality and/or limited appeal}}

The '''dump months''' are what the film community calls the two periods of the year when there are lowered commercial and critical expectations for most new releases from [[Cinema of the United States|American filmmakers]] and [[Film distribution|distributors]]. Domestic audiences during these periods are smaller than the rest of the year, so no [[Tent-pole (entertainment)|tentpole]] movies are released. [[January]]&lt;ref name="Guardian article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Jonathan|title=Why January is a good month to bury bad movies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jan/08/awardsandprizes.features|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=January 8, 2007|accessdate=December 18, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929051530/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jan/08/awardsandprizes.features|archivedate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[February]] are usually most commonly described this way, with [[August]] and [[September]] sometimes included.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Burr|first=Ty|authorlink=Ty Burr|title='January Is Hollywood's Very Own Leper Colony'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/how-to-survive-januarys-dearth-of-good-movies.html|publisher=[[New York Times Magazine]]|date=January 18, 2013|accessdate=December 19, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107172343/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/how-to-survive-januarys-dearth-of-good-movies.html?_r=0 |archivedate=January 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Releases during those times primarily include films that would have been released at other times of year had they done better at [[test screening]]s, films with less prominent stars, genre films (particularly [[horror film|horror]]), movies that cannot be easily marketed and films intended for a teenage audience, which has fewer entertainment options outside the home.

Several factors combine to create the dump months, most of them circumstances particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases. Both periods immediately follow the times of year in which the distributors concentrate films they expect to be the biggest critical and/or commercial successes, periods of increased spending on entertainment generally. While this often means that moviegoers have less [[disposable income]] afterward, economics alone does not explain the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the [[Academy Awards]] eligibility rules.

The dump months evolved over the course of the 20th century. Although during the [[studio era]] most major releases followed annual patterns similar to today's, several classics like ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'', ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' and ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' were released during January. Since the decline of the studios, however, memorable films from the dump months have become rare exceptions. The most notable is ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', a well-reviewed box office smash released in late January [[1991 in film|1991]] that went on to win that year's [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Several years before that, ''[[Dirty Dancing (film)|Dirty Dancing]]'' and ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'' became hits following releases in August and September respectively.

Films released during the dump months have not always been consigned to cinematic oblivion. Some, like ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]'' and ''[[Office Space]]'', have become [[cult classic]]s. Starting with ''[[Cloverfield]]'', some 21st-century dump-months releases have managed to exceed $100 million on box office receipts. The similar success of low-budget horror films like ''[[The Devil Inside (film)|The Devil Inside]]'' and ''[[Mama (2013 film)|Mama]]'' in the early 2010s has prompted studios to release films in that [[genre]] at times of the year other than [[Halloween]] and the dump months.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary}}
The term "dump months" comes from the belief that studios use the time periods in question as a "dumping ground" for movies they are contractually obligated to release but believe to have limited commercial prospects at best.&lt;ref name="AV Club article"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Tasha|last2=rabin|first2=Nathan|last3=Tobias|first3=Scott|last4=Murray|first4=Noel|last5=Rizov|first5=Vadim|last6=Handlen|first6=Zack|last7=Dyess-Nugent|first7=Phil|last8=Semley|first8=John|title=Hollywood's trash, our treasure: 17 salvageable flops from the late-winter dumping ground|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/hollywoods-trash-our-treasure-17-salvageable-flops-91570|work=[[The A.V.

Critics and journalists have no such reservations. "The first months of the year are known as the 'dump months' in Hollywood," wrote ''Vegas Seven'' critic Una LaMarche in early 2013, a period characterized by "movies that studios dislike, and want to release with little fanfare."&lt;ref name="Vegas Seven article"&gt;{{cite web|last=LaMarche|first=Una|title=A Cinematic Dumpster Dive|url=http://vegasseven.com/2013/01/03/cinematic-dumpster-dive/|publisher=[[Vegas Seven]]|date=January 3, 2012|accessdate=December 19, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219234846/http://vegasseven.com/2013/01/03/cinematic-dumpster-dive/|archive-date=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Paul Shirey at [[JoBlo.com]] dismisses September as "one of the most worthless months at the box office."&lt;ref name="JoBlo.com article"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shirey|first=Paul|title=C'mon Hollywood: Spread out your Oscar fare!|url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/cmon-hollywood-spread-out-your-oscar-fare|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|date=February 12, 2013|accessdate=December 20, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010022117/http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/cmon-hollywood-spread-out-your-oscar-fare|archivedate=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest use of the term to turn up in a [[Google]] search is a 2007 article in the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]''.
"In the US, January is 'dump month' at the movies," critic Jonathan Bernstein wrote. "The films no studios believe in or care about ... suddenly become the sole choice available to regular filmgoers hungry for fresh fare."&lt;ref name="Guardian article" /&gt; Use of the term became more common in the early 2010s.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AV Club article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vulture post" /&gt;

==Causes==

While both dump-month periods immediately follow periods of greater movie attendance when [[event movie]]s expected to be critical and/or commercial successes are released,&lt;ref name="Film.com post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Legel|first=Laremy|title=Why is January a Cinematic Dumping Ground?|url=http://www.film.com/movies/january-box-office-slump|publisher=[[Film.com]]|date=January 9, 2013|accessdate=December 25, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226063034/http://www.film.com/movies/january-box-office-slump|archivedate=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and periods of greater consumer spending generally there are also reasons specific to both periods that further dampen movie attendance to limit the expected box office returns to the extent that movies with strong potential will be scheduled for other times of year.&lt;ref name="Metacritic post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dietz|first=Jason|title=The Nightmare After Christmas: Are January Movies Really That Bad?|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/are-january-movies-really-that-bad|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|date=January 5, 2010|accessdate=December 19, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215042004/http://www.metacritic.com/feature/are-january-movies-really-that-bad|archivedate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="August 2008 Vulture post"&gt;{{cite web|title=The August Movie: A Theory of Awfulness|url=http://www.vulture.com/2008/07/august_movie_awfulness.html|publisher=Vulture|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=December 24, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102174535/http://www.vulture.com/2008/07/august_movie_awfulness.html|archivedate=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== January–February ===

The main impediment to the release of highly anticipated or high-quality films in January and February is the calendar of the two major film awards, the Golden Globe Awards (January) and the Academy Awards, or "Oscars" (late February or early March), which overlap with those months. The winter weather also adds uncertainty to estimates of potential box office. Two holidays during the time provide some slight relief; however, they are offset by the distraction of [[Super Bowl]] weekend, which depresses spending on movies. The combined gross for all January releases 2002–2012 has averaged $387 million; for February it is $615 million. By comparison December, with its holiday releases, averages $1.2 billion.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

Spending is low to begin with since many consumers are cutting back and repaying debts incurred during the preceding holiday season,{{efn|In 2017 a [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll found, prior to the holiday season, that Americans expected to spend, on average, $862 on gifts during that time of year.

The website ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'', which publishes reports on film grosses, divides the movie year into five seasons. It defines the winter season as lasting from the first day after [[New Year's Day|New Year's]] week or weekend ends through the Thursday before the first Friday in [[March]]. The site's data go back to 1982, and in every year the winter season has had the lowest [[box office]] [[Gross (economics)|grosses]]. The weakest winter was 1983, when ''[[The Entity]]'''s $13 million take led the way to a total of $93.4 million in domestic grosses for all movies released during that season. On the other end, 2012 had the strongest winter, at $1.24 billion, topped by ''[[Safe House (2012 film)|Safe House]]'', which took in $124 million.&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo Seasons page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seasonal Box Office|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/seasonal/?chart=byseason&amp;season=Winter&amp;view=releasedate|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=December 22, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018051747/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/seasonal/?chart=byseason&amp;view=releasedate&amp;season=Winter|archivedate=October 18, 2015}} Click on the season names to view data for each season going back to 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Awards calendar====

At the end of the year comes the holiday movie season, when the studios release both [[tent-pole (entertainment)|tentpole]] movies, such as the latest installments in popular [[media franchise|franchises]] that are expected to be highly successful and "[[Oscar bait]]" movies that are seen as likely to earn critical praise and, more importantly, nominations for major awards such as the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]] and [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], the industry's most prestigious. Those nominations are then used to promote the film. But while the former nominations are announced in December with the awards themselves given in early January, the Academy Award nominations are announced ''after'' the Golden Globes, and the actual awards are not given until late February{{efn|Until 2004 both the nomination announcement and awards ceremonies took place later in the winter&lt;ref name="Oscar schedule change"&gt;{{cite news|last=Willman|first=Chris|title=Who wins with the Oscars moved to February?|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2002/07/23/who-wins-oscars-moved-february|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 23, 2002|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the latter in April, as recently as 1988&lt;ref name="60th Oscars"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 60th Academy Awards|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1988|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|date=2015|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).}} leaving most of the first two months of the year as [[Oscar season]]: a period during which any Golden Globes received as well as Oscar nominations can be used to promote the film to audiences, while studios lobby Academy members to vote for their nominees.&lt;ref name="Metacritic post" /&gt;

To be eligible for award consideration, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] requires that a film be shown in a theater in [[Los Angeles County, California]], for at least seven consecutive days during which it is advertised in print media.&lt;ref name="Oscar eligibility rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules &amp; Eligibility |url=http://www.oscars.org/sites/default/files/88aa_rules.pdf |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |pages=2–3 |year=2015 |accessdate=October 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924141221/http://www.oscars.org/sites/default/files/88aa_rules.pdf |archivedate=September 24, 2015 |df= }}; {{cite web|title=Rule Two: Eligibility |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule02.html |3= |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110071910/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule02.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studios hoping to position a film for some nominations usually satisfy that minimum requirement, then ease them into [[wide release]] from then until the nominations and/or awards ceremony. The flexibility this [[marketing]] strategy requires means that screens be available, and studios limit their releases of new films during this time to that end. As critic [[Ty Burr]] explained in a 2013 ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' article on the mediocrity of new releases in the first month of the year: "[T]he studios ... know our attention is elsewhere."&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

New films shown publicly anywhere for the first time after January 1 themselves are ineligible for Oscars until the following year, by which time they will likely have been forgotten by critics, audiences and voters.&lt;ref name="Metacritic post" /&gt; ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', winner of the [[64th Academy Awards|1991 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], is a rare exception, as the only film in the post-studio era released in the first two months of its year to go on to win that Oscar.&lt;ref name="AV Club early-release Best Picture Winners post"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unseasonable prestige: 22 Best Picture winners released between January and July|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/unseasonable-prestige-22-best-picture-winners-rele-100489|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=July 22, 2013|accessdate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burr calls it "the grand exception to the January Movies Will Never Amount to Anything rule," and finds that only one other classic of the late 20th century, ''[[Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|Dr. Strangelove]]'', was a January release.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;{{efn|Its premiere had originally been scheduled for the preceding November, but was postponed due to the [[Kennedy assassination]].&lt;ref name="George C.

Theaters will also still be running any holiday-season hits even if they had not been nominated for awards, further reducing the screens available for new movies. Ray Subers, an editor at ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'', says there are two types of January moviegoer that keep December releases on screens throughout the months. "Discerning adult audiences", he told ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in 2012, spend the month congregating to those films on critics' lists for the best of the year they have not yet gotten to see, while "the general moviegoers are seeing the event films of December."&lt;ref name="Atlantic post" /&gt;

====Winter weather====

During January and February [[winter storm]]s become more likely than they are in December. While they do not affect the entire U.S., the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] are particularly prone to them, along with most neighboring areas of [[Canada]]. This includes many major metropolitan areas, and movie markets, in both countries.&lt;ref name="Metacritic post" /&gt;

When winter storms hit, bringing with them combinations of [[precipitation]] that making driving difficult and sometimes dangerous, moviegoers often prefer to stay home.

Industry analysts feared that the storm could seriously impact the box office prospects of two films opening that weekend, ''[[Identity Thief]]'' and ''[[Side Effects (2013 film)|Side Effects]]'',&lt;ref name="Business Insider Nemo post" /&gt; both of which were seen as having potential to do better than most winter movies.&lt;ref name="Boxoffice Nemo post"&gt;{{cite web|title=UPDATED: Winter Storm Nemo Fails To Stop 'Identity Thief' From Shattering Expectations |url=http://www.boxoffice.com/latest-news/2013-02-08-how-big-of-an-impact-will-winter-storm-nemo-have-on-the-box-office |publisher=[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]] |date=February 9, 2013 |accessdate=December 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224090058/http://www.boxoffice.com/latest-news/2013-02-08-how-big-of-an-impact-will-winter-storm-nemo-have-on-the-box-office |archivedate=December 24, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it afterwards appeared that the two films were not seriously affected, and did better than expected, with ''Identity Thief'' even winning the weekend, despite generally poor reviews and [[word of mouth]], with $36 million in receipts, overall box office was down 45% from the same weekend the previous year. ''Side Effects'' finished a distant third with a quarter of ''Identity Thief'''s take.&lt;ref name="Deadline Hollywood Nemo post" /&gt; The clearest sign of the storm's effect, according to ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'', was the 35% drop in earnings for ''[[Silver Linings Playbook]]'', then in wide release after several Oscar nominations.&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo Nemo post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Subers|first=Ray|title=Friday Report: Winter Storm Doesn't Stop 'Identity Thief'|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3626&amp;p=.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|date=February 9, 2013|accessdate=December 22, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911083911/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3626&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Holiday weekends and Super Bowl====

While holiday weekends in the US generally increase film audiences and thus attract major releases throughout the year, the two that occur during these months—[[Martin Luther King Day]] in January and [[Presidents' Day]] in February—offer only a modest prospect for improvement. The most lucrative take by any movie on Martin Luther King Day weekend is $107.2 million by ''[[American Sniper]]'' in 2015, its first weekend in [[wide release]];&lt;ref name="MLK day weekend all-time grosses"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 4-day Martin Luther King weekends, All Movies|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/mlk.htm?page=MLK|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=December 20, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916225149/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/mlk.htm?page=MLKOPEN&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the previous best opening weekend was ''[[Ride Along (film)|Ride Along]]'' the previous year, taking in $41.5 million&lt;ref name="January all-time opening weekends"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top January opening weekends|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/month/?mo=01&amp;p=.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=March 12, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905111600/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/month/?mo=01&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ($48.6 million if the entire three-day holiday weekend is counted&lt;ref name="MLK all-time opening weekends" /&gt;).

Presidents' Day benefits by its proximity to [[Valentine's Day]] (which, as it is always February 14, is often a weekday), which offers the studios enough chance of a payoff, usually from [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]] and other "[[chick flick]]s" marketed towards women as date movies. "[Some years] it's been six straight weeks of dreck until" that holiday, says Cargill.&lt;ref name="Hollywood.com article"/&gt; ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|Fifty Shades of Grey]]'', the 2015 adaptation of [[Fifty Shades of Grey|the bestselling erotic novel]], took in $93 million on its opening weekend, the largest take for a Presidents' Day weekend until ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' broke that record the year later. ''[[Valentine's Day (2010 film)|Valentine's Day]]'', the 2010 romantic comedy with a large [[ensemble cast]], is third with $63.1 million. Third among opening weekends is ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'', which took in $52 million in 2007; the best performance by a previously released film on President's Day weekend is the $62.4 million take by ''[[The Lego Movie]]'', a week after its release in 2014.&lt;ref name="MLK all-time opening weekends"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 4-day President's Day weekends, Opening Weekends|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/presidentsday.htm?page=PRSOPEN&amp;p=.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=December 20, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915015831/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/presidentsday.htm?page=PRSOPEN&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="President's Day weekend gross"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 4-day President's Day weekends, All Movies|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/presidentsday.htm?page=PRS&amp;p=.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=December 20, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915011512/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/presidentsday.htm?page=PRS&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the [[superhero film]], ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' set a new record for that holiday weekend with $235 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Box Office: ‘Black Panther’ Heads to Glory With $235 Million Holiday Weekend|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/black-panther-box-office-opening-1202704091/|accessdate=27 February 2018|work=Variety|date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the consistent popularity of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] franchise, the critical praise and the holiday weekend, [[Marvel Studios]] took advantage of the fact that despite the month's supposed poor reputation for audience interest, it is also [[Black History Month]], a cultural event that made it an ideal time to release a film with such obvious African themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wanshel|first1=Elyse|title=Black Panther' Is Breaking An Insane Number Of Box Office Records It’s truly epic.|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/black-panther-box-office-records_us_5a8dc461e4b0273053a73325|accessdate=27 February 2018|publisher=Huffington Post|date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any boost movie grosses get from those two holidays, however, is offset by what typically comes between them.

The most successful film to open during Super Bowl weekend is the 2008 [[concert film]] ''[[Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert]]'', which took in $31.1 million, almost half the total it would earn during a released limited to just that weekend and the following week.

"As we enter the dog days of summer, we get the summer movie season dregs as well," wrote [[PopMatters]] editor Bill Gibron, anticipating August 2013.&lt;ref name="PopMatters August 2013 preview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibron|first=Bill|title=The PopMatters Summer Movie Preview – August 2013|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/173923-the-popmatters-summer-movie-preview-august-2013/|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=December 24, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009083745/http://www.popmatters.com/feature/173923-the-popmatters-summer-movie-preview-august-2013/|archivedate=October 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The year's other dump period straddles summer and fall, and does not lend itself to being as clearly delineated as the winter dump months.

At the end of August is the annual American celebration of [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]], the only holiday weekend during this period. Of all the year's holiday weekends it is reliably the weakest in terms of movie box office, with the top grosser for the weekend being the 2007 [[Rob Zombie]]-directed [[reimagining]] of ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'', at $30.5 million. ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', then in its fourth week, is a close second after pulling in $29 million in 1999; in a distant second for opening weekends is yet another [[horror film]], 2012's ''[[The Possession]]'' with $21.1 million.&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo Labor Day weekends"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 4-Day Labor Day Weekends, 1982–present|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/laborday.htm?page=LABOPEN&amp;p=.htm|accessdate=December 24, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926145252/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/laborday.htm/?page=LABOPEN&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

September's counterpart to Sundance, the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], is held at the end of the month. The film community's attention is focused on the Canadian city. Critics gather to see potential Oscar contenders among the many [[independent film]]s on the program and studio executives look to line up distribution deals with the same prize in mind. Some of the best are released within a week or so, ending the September dump period.&lt;ref name="JoBlo.com article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2009 NYT TIFF story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cieply|first=Michael|title=Oscar Race May Heat Up at Festival in Toronto |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/movies/01toronto.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 31, 2009|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In past years, October also was when eagerly anticipated [[horror film]]s reached screens, to capitalize on the approach of [[Halloween]] at the end of the month. However, this began to change in the 2000s due to the way series such as the ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' and ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' films dominated that period, prompting distributors of other horror films to consider releasing them during the winter dump months instead. In 2012 [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] enjoyed huge success with the unheralded ''[[The Devil Inside (film)|The Devil Inside]]'', released right after [[New Year's Day]]&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo Devil Inside summary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Devil Inside summary|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=devilinside.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|year=2013|accessdate=December 25, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905193324/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=devilinside.htm|archivedate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a strongly negative critical and audience reaction; the next year ''[[Mama (2013 film)|Mama]]'' was received enthusiastically by critics and filmgoers when it came out on Martin Luther King Day weekend&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo Mama summary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mama summary|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mama.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|year=2013|accessdate=December 25, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905091817/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mama.htm|archivedate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being rescheduled from the previous October to avoid going up against ''[[Sinister (film)|Sinister]]'' and ''[[Paranormal Activity 4]]''. Only one major horror film, the third adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Carrie (2013 film)|Carrie]]'', was released in October 2013, and it underperformed.

==Statistical analyses==
The dump months' obstacles are reflected in their box office totals, particularly the success of movies opening during those months. January's strongest domestic opening weekend ever was the $90 million ''[[American Sniper (film)|American Sniper]]'' took in when it went into wide release on Martin Luther King Day weekend in 2015. The best opening weekend for a movie seeing screens for the first time in January was the $42 million pulled in by ''[[Ride Along (film)|Ride Along]]'' the year before; it is the lowest best opening weekend gross for any month.{{efn|Based on standard two-day weekend totals.

In January 2010, ''[[Metacritic]]'' editor Jason Dietz undertook a statistical analysis of whether films released in that month were, as perceived, inferior. He compared the site's aggregate scores, based on critical and audience consensus, for films released in January, February, and March from 2000 to 2009. January averaged the fewest releases of the three, and the lowest average scores. Of the 88 films released in the first month of the year during that decade, only six earned above a 61 average on the site's scale of 0 to 100,{{efn|The scores given critical reviews are assigned by the website's staff, making them subjective.&lt;ref name="Metacritic scoring system"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/about-metascores|title=How We Create the Metascore Magic|date=2015|accessdate=October 20, 2015|work=Metacritic|publisher=[[CBS Interactive Inc.]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928225241/http://www.metacritic.com/about-metascores|archivedate=September 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} the lowest of any of the three winter months, even accounting for the increase in releases as the spring becomes closer.&lt;ref name="Metacritic post" /&gt;

It did not seem to Dietz as if there was any relationship between critical praise and audience enthusiasm for January films. The best-rated, Disney's 2004 animated musical ''[[Teacher's Pet (2004 film)|Teacher's Pet]]'', was a commercial failure, as was 2001's ''[[The Pledge (film)|The Pledge]]''. ''Cloverfield'', the third entry, was a success, and behind it ''[[Freedom Writers]]'' had ridden its good reviews to do some modest box office in 2007; however ''[[How She Move]]'' had flopped that same year.&lt;ref name="Metacritic post" /&gt;

Conversely, some of the successful January releases did not meet with critical acclaim. ''[[Taken (film)|Taken]]'' had been highly successful at the end of the month in 2009 despite reviews that ranged across the spectrum. And two weeks before that film's release, the universally panned comedy ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop]]'' had opened strong on its way to a total take over $150 million.&lt;ref name="Metacritic post" /&gt;

Contemplating the offerings for January 2013, Adam Raymond at ''[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'' undertook a ranking of a quarter-century of Januarys based on scores at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (RT), another [[review aggregator]]. He averaged the ratings for all films released in a particular January, with the best and worst scores noted. By this method the best and worst Januarys were both in the earliest years for which the site kept scores. "[T]his could be more a result of the fact that far fewer movies used to be released then, so it took less to sway the average," Raymond noted.&lt;ref name="Vulture post" /&gt;

The best January was also the first, 1987, whose 79% average was led by [[Woody Allen]]'s acclaimed ''[[Radio Days]]''. At 95%, it was also the best-rated January film during the survey period. That month's lowest-rated new release, ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'', still managed a 50% rating, better than the average for all but one of the other years.&lt;ref name="Vulture post" /&gt;

At the other end was January 1989, where the 26% achieved by ''[[Gleaming the Cube]]'' and the 0% awarded to ''[[DeepStar Six]]'' bracketed a 16% average. Five other January films joined it at the bottom of the scale.&lt;ref name="Vulture post" /&gt; It was recognized as a nadir among Januarys even at the time. In a contemporary essay in ''[[The New York Times]]'' after the month had concluded, an exasperated [[Janet Maslin]] presciently noted that "the January that has just ended really looks like one for the record books."&lt;ref name="Janet Maslin 1989 essay"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|authorlink=Janet Maslin|title=Film View: Is January the Cruelest Month?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/05/movies/film-view-is-january-the-cruelest-month.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 5, 1989|accessdate=December 31, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525110650/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/05/movies/film-view-is-january-the-cruelest-month.html|archivedate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the 21st-century Januarys, 2011 did the best at 39%, led by ''[[The Way Back]]'''s 75%. The worst was 2003, when ''[[Final Destination 2]]'' led the pack to a 23% average with its score of 47%. ''[[Kangaroo Jack]]'' brought up the rear at 8%.&lt;ref name="Vulture post" /&gt;

Looking ahead to the movies of February 2014, Chris Kirk and Kim Thompson at ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]'' argued that February's movies were statistically the worst of any month. Their evidence was the average RT ratings for all movies for each month between 2000 and 2013. February's averaged 45%, three points lower than January and September and four below August. February also had the worst month in the entire sample period, with the 2001 releases from that month coming in at 31%; 2010 and 2012 tied for the best February at 54%.&lt;ref name="Slate February 2014 article"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Chris|last2=Thompson|title=Confirmed: February Movies Suck|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/brow_beat/2014/02/february_movies_are_bad_here_s_statistical_proof_of_it.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=February 6, 2014|accessdate=February 7, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417164703/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/brow_beat/2014/02/february_movies_are_bad_here_s_statistical_proof_of_it.html|archivedate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No comparable analysis has ever been done on films released during the late-summer dump months. At the end of July 2008, ''Vulture'' again greeted the coming month with two posts on the drop in movie quality historically associated with the month, and its theories for what might explain that.&lt;ref name="August 2008 Vulture post" /&gt; One was a history of the previous 15 Augusts, with movies released in each month subjectively rated as "halfway-decent" or "lousy".&lt;ref name="August 2008 history Vulture post"&gt;{{cite web|title=The August Movie: A History|url=http://www.vulture.com/2008/07/history_of_august.html|publisher=Vulture|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=December 29, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102213255/http://www.vulture.com/2008/07/history_of_august.html|archivedate=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that over that time there had been 169 lousy movies, and 26 halfway-decent ones. "That's 11.2 movies per August that make you want to claw your eyes out."&lt;ref name="August 2008 Vulture post" /&gt;

Most of the Augusts in the time period in question had one or two "halfway-decent" movies, with the other 9–11 movies discarded as "lousy". The exceptions were the consecutive years 1998–99. The former was regarded as the worst August, with no halfway-decent movies and all its releases (''[[The Avengers (1998 film)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[How Stella Got Her Groove Back]]'' and ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later|Halloween H20]]'', among others) considered lousy. But in August 1999, there were five halfway-decent films: ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', ''[[The Iron Giant]]'', ''[[Dick (film)|Dick]]'' and ''[[Bowfinger]]''.&lt;ref name="August 2008 history Vulture post" /&gt;

==History==

According to Burr, from the earliest days of the [[studio system]] major releases had largely followed the same calendar modern audiences would recognize, clustered during spring, summer, and the end-of-year holidays. "Yet January was still in the mix," he observes. "[[Silent film|Silent-era]] [[Charlie Chaplin]] hits like ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' (1921) and ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'' (1928), the [[Greta Garbo|Garbo]]/[[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] melodrama ''[[Flesh and the Devil]]'' (1927) and [[Josef von Sternberg]]'s ''[[The Last Command (1928 film)|Last Command]]'' (1928) all came out during the first month of the year."&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;
[[File:Chaplin The Kid 3.jpg|thumb|right|Charlie Chaplin in ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'', a classic released in January 1921|alt=A black and white image of a young man with a mustache and a bowler hat peaking around from behind a brick corner with a police officer behind them]]
The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, may well have been the 1940s. It began with what he suggests was best January in cinema history. ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'', ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' and ''[[The Shop Around the Corner]]'', all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'', ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' and ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]''.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

A few months after ''Treasure'''s release, the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] handed down its decision in ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'', [[holding (law)|holding]] that it was a violation of [[antitrust]] law for the studios to own theater chains as well. This has historically been seen as the beginning of the end of the studio system.&lt;ref name="Paramount Pictures case"&gt;{{cite web|title=The day the Supreme Court killed Hollywood’s studio system|url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2014/05/the-day-the-supreme-court-killed-hollywoods-studio-system/|publisher=[[National Constitution Center]]|date=May 5, 2014|accessdate=April 24, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129063359/http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2014/05/the-day-the-supreme-court-killed-hollywoods-studio-system/|archivedate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burr found that after it, with movies having less of a guaranteed box office since an adequate theatrical run was no longer a certainty, "release patterns began to clump more formally around big weekends, warmer weather and national holidays."&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

In the mid-1970s, the studios discovered the summer blockbuster via the success of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. In the following decade the rise of [[independent film|independent]] producers dedicated to quality such as [[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant Ivory]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] made the October–December the year's other highlight. But those two concentrations left the post-holiday winter and late summer as the lows that followed the highs. By the 2010s, Burr said, "August is death by ennui. And January is suicide."&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt; Similarly, ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' had noted at the same time, "over the past few decades, the American movie schedule has calcified ... January and February are when studios dump their discards, the movies they have low hopes for and want to disavow."&lt;ref name="AV Club article" /&gt;

Producer [[Daniel Melnick]], whose ''[[Altered States]]'' was moved up a month into the 1980 Christmas season by the studio over his objections, complained about this in an interview at the time. "I would rather go at a time when there are fewer people attending movies and offer them pictures they want to see, rather than to divide a larger audience with ten other desirable films ... [A]s an industry we have very often shown the instinct of [[lemming]]s ... We're all convinced that people go to the movies primarily at Christmas time, so we release our big pictures then ..."&lt;ref name="Adventures in the Screen Trade"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=William|title=Adventures in the Screen Trade|year=1982|publisher=[[Hachette Digital]]|isbn=9781455525461|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdNXo2952boC&amp;pg=PT63|accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of that decade critics had taken notice as well. After January 1989, the month that ''[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'' would 24 years later find to be the movies' worst January ever, ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Janet Maslin]] had had enough. Her idea of "movie hell" she said, included among other indignities having to watch only January releases. "It's well known that January films have a character that is, let us say, distinctive ... What is it that leads film distributors to regard January as just the right resting place for so many flukes, black sheep, wild cards and also-rans?" She allowed that recent years had allowed some good films, such as ''[[Radio Days]]'' and ''[[El Norte (film)|El Norte]]'', to get attention they might not have in other months of the year. However, that January had had as one its major releases ''[[The January Man]]'', a thriller she characterized as aptly titled, despite not even being the worst the month had to offer (that dubious honor, she suggested, went to ''[[Deepstar Six]]'').&lt;ref name="Janet Maslin 1989 essay" /&gt;

Despite the critical and commercial success of  ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' in 1991, Burr qualified it as an [[exception that proves the rule|exception that proved the rule]]. First, it had been released at the very end of January; and second, it had only gone into [[wide release]] two weeks later. Such a strategy is typical of January, Burr writes. "[It']s a studio's way of gritting its teeth and ripping off the [[Band-Aid]]."&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

==Criticism==

Some observers have suggested that studios and distributors' insistence on seasonal patterns of release is counterproductive. In a 2015 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article, [[James Surowiecki]] suggested that the lack of moveigoers' interest during the dump months may result from audiences' lowered expectations rather than any external factors: "[I]f you release blockbusters in July and dogs in January, no wonder people go to the movies more often in July."&lt;ref name="Surowiecki New Yorker piece"&gt;{{cite news|last=Surowiecki|first=James|authorlink=James Surowiecki|title=rethinking the Seasonal Strategy|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/rethinking-seasonal-strategy|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=February 23, 2015|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surowiecki cited a 2002 study by [[Stanford University|Stanford]] economist Liran Einav, who analyzed 15 years of ticket sales and found that while there is indeed a seasonal fluctuation in [[demand]], it is not significant enough to validate the prevalent patterns of release; instead it seemed to him that distributors are responding to "the observed pattern of sales and ''not'' ... the estimated underlying demand." The cyclical variations in revenue, he found, result primarily from the clustering of highly anticipated releases during winter holiday season and the summertime.&lt;ref name="Einav paper"&gt;{{cite web|last=Einav|first=Liran|title=Seasonality and Competition in Time: An Empirical Analysis of Release-Date Decisions by the U.S. Motion Picture Industry|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.145.9507&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|date=August 12, 2002|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 economic study of North American film release date patterns by two French economists, Manuel Cartier and Sébastien Liarte, agreed with Einav that the "temporal agglomeration" of potential blockbuster movies was not driven by realistic understanding of annual demand patterns. Instead, the authors came to believe that it was more socially driven, "normative mimicry whose end is to respect the beliefs, habits and norms of the [industry]." Exposing movies released at those times to films that could compete most effectively with them, they concluded, resulted in less overall profit for the studios than they might earn otherwise.&lt;ref name="French temporal agglomeration paper"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cartier |first1=Manuel |last2=Liarte |first2=Sébastien |title=Market entry timing, uncertainty and temporal agglomeration: The case of the Hollywood cinema industry |journal=M@n@gement |date=2010 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=70–98 |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/90f080a487c4207c836ab8b4305e9ee4/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=286201 |accessdate=August 3, 2018 |location=[[Nantes]] |language=English, French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry insiders do not disagree with this assessment; in 2013, [[Viacom]]'s then-[[chief executive officer]], [[Philippe Dauman]], said publicly that the clustering of tentpole releases was keeping those films from making all the money they could if they were not in such close competition.&lt;ref name="Surowiecki New Yorker piece" /&gt; Ten years earlier, [[Tom Ortenberg]], then head of distribution for [[Lionsgate Films]], told ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' that "there is never a bad time to release a good film—and there is never a good time to release a bad film,."&lt;ref name="2003 NYT release date article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rottenberg|first=Josh|title=The Imperfect Science of Release Dates|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/09/magazine/the-imperfect-science-of-release-dates.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=November 9, 2003|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Surowiecki noted that Cartier and Liarte's conclusions that social factors within the industry played a part i the continuation of the release cycles that result in the dump months, due to the many uncertainties involved in producing and distributing a major motion picture and studio executives' desire to avoid blame for a big-budget film's commercial failure. "If you open a blockbuster on Memorial Day and it fails, no one is going to blame you for your release strategy", Einav, who in his paper likened this phenomenon to the maxim on [[Wall Street]] that no one ever gets fired for recommending investors buy shares of [[IBM]],&lt;ref name="Einav 30n42"&gt;Einav, 30n42&lt;/ref&gt; told him. "If you open a potential blockbuster in February and it fails you're going to be on the hook."&lt;ref name="Surowiecki New Yorker piece" /&gt;

In 2013, John Fithian, president of the [[National Association of Theater Owners]] (NATO), criticized the dump months (among several other studio practices) at [[CinemaCon]], the annual gathering of [[film exhibitor]]s hosted by NATO. The theaters had come off a first quarter where receipts had been down 12% from the first quarter of 2012. He faulted the studios for their insufficiently diverse offerings in 2013 as compared to the first quarter of the year before, which he connected to the dump-months phenomenon. "Any month can produce a $100 million movie," he said in his speech. "In 2012, distributors spread their movies over the calendar, and we had a record year."&lt;ref name="Fithian speech" /&gt;

Responding later, in an [[indieWIRE]] panel discussion hosted by [[Anne Thompson (film critic)|Anne Thompson]], [[Universal Studios]] chairman Adam Fogelson agreed in principle with Fithian, saying "there are very few reasons other than historical behavior why almost any film can't work on almost any weekend ..." he said. He pointed to the 2005 success of ''[[White Noise (film)|White Noise]]'' on the first weekend of January as having opened that time up to similar low-budget horror films.&lt;ref name="Anne Thompson panel"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Anne|authorlink=Anne Thompson (film critic)|title=CinemaCon Heavyweight Panel Debates Windows, Social Media, State of Industry|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/cinemacon-heavyweight-panel-debates-windows-social-media-state-of-industry|newspaper=[[indieWIRE]]|date=April 26, 2013|accessdate=January 1, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419152157/http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/cinemacon-heavyweight-panel-debates-windows-social-media-state-of-industry|archivedate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he called the belief among some exhibitors that the theaters' slump was attributable to a plethora of [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R-rated]] films saved for January, a criticism repeated by Fithian, "simplistic." The problem was the movies in question, not their ratings. ''[[Django Unchained]]'', he insisted, would have been a hit regardless of the month it opened. "It happens to be about the movies," Fogelson said. "People tend to, if not forget, minimize how complicated this is."&lt;ref name="Anne Thompson panel" /&gt;

Surowiecki credits another Universal executive, former distribution chief Nikki Rocco, for livening up the dump months. She, he wrote, believed that people would go see a movie at any time of year if it was good enough, and that that could make lesser movies hits if they came out at less competitive times of year. Not only did Rocco move apparent summer releases like 1999's ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' to the beginning of May, she also found success for the studio in August with ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' and scheduled ''Ride Along'', ''Identity Thief'' and ''Safe House'' for what wound up being successful runs following January release dates. Surowiecki compared her to [[Billy Beane]]. former [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Oakland Athletics]], who likewise found a way for a smaller, less wealthy team to compete at the highest levels by using [[analytics]] to identify undervalued assets.&lt;ref name="Surowiecki New Yorker piece" /&gt;

==Releasing strategies==

Critics and movie fans have observed that studios and other distributors have leaned on particular types of movies, or particular [[genre]]s, to get them through the dump months. Some of them overlap:
* "'''Mediocre comedies'''", as Scott Meslow of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' puts it, referring to films like ''[[Tooth Fairy (2010 film)|Tooth Fairy]]'', ''[[Bride Wars]]'' and ''[[Hotel for Dogs (film)|Hotel for Dogs]]'', all of which had tepid critical receptions but did better than they might have at other times of year.&lt;ref name="Atlantic post" /&gt; In the 2010s, these films have been doing even better, with ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop]]'' and ''[[Identity Thief]]'' both vaulting past unimpressed critics to gross over $100 million in consecutive years; the former is the all-time top-grossing January release.&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo top January releases"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Grossers for January, Indexed by Total Gross|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/monthly/?view=releasedate&amp;chart=bymonth&amp;month=1&amp;sort=sumgross&amp;order=DESC&amp;p=.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|year=2014|accessdate=January 1, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174920/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/monthly/?view=releasedate&amp;chart=bymonth&amp;month=1&amp;sort=sumgross&amp;order=DESC&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "'''Mediocre action movies'''". Meslow points to ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' and ''[[Underworld: Evolution]]'' as films that, like their comic counterparts, succeeded commercially due to their January release. In 2011, he adds, rescheduling ''[[The Green Hornet (2011 film)|The Green Hornet]]'' to January from its originally intended release the previous summer proved to be a very lucrative decision.&lt;ref name="Atlantic post" /&gt; A decade earlier, in a piece about his general complaints with August, ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]'' editor [[David Plotz]] included "egregious action movies" dominating movie screens during the month."&lt;ref name="David Plotz piece"&gt;{{cite news|last=Plotz|first=David|authorlink=David Plotz|title=August|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2001/07/august.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=July 2001|accessdate=January 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929120014/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2001/07/august.html|archivedate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Low-cost [[rerelease]]s''': In 2011, Meslow recounts, [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney]] rereleased ''[[The Lion King]]'' in [[3D film|3-D]] to test whether its core audience would be amenable to the format. The experiment wound up becoming the highest-grossing September release ever.&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo top September releases"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Grossers for September, Indexed by Total Gross|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/monthly/?view=releasedate&amp;chart=bymonth&amp;month=9&amp;sort=sumgross&amp;order=DESC&amp;p=.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|year=2014|accessdate=January 1, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905105928/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/monthly/?view=releasedate&amp;chart=bymonth&amp;month=9&amp;sort=sumgross&amp;order=DESC&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed it up with ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' in 3-D, released the following January. [[George Lucas]] primed audiences for the [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy]] by releasing the enhanced "Special Edition" of the original trilogy during the winter dump months, Meslow recalled.&lt;ref name="Atlantic post" /&gt;
* '''Low budgets, generally''': ''[[Taken (film)|Taken]]'' and ''Paul Blart&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''s stars, [[Liam Neeson]] and [[Kevin James]] respectively, are not considered [[A-list]]ers, [[bankable star|bankable]] enough to open a major movie on the strength of their names alone. Therefore, Meslow writes, they work for lower salaries, which helps keep budgets low enough for the film to be profitable with a smaller potential audience amid minimal competition.&lt;ref name="Atlantic post" /&gt;
* '''Teen-oriented movies'''. Since teenagers, "the demographic with an excess of idle time in January," are less interested in movies touted as potential Oscar winners than adults, Meslow reasons, studios make the effort to release films targeted to them. So, romantic films like ''[[She's All That]]'', ''[[Save the Last Dance]]'' and ''[[A Walk to Remember]]'' have successfully opened in January. The low-budget parody films of [[Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer]], such as ''[[Date Movie]]'' and ''[[Meet the Spartans]]'', also did well with the teen market in the dump months despite strongly negative reception from critics and audiences.&lt;ref name="Atlantic post" /&gt;

Not all films released in the dump months were originally intended for that period, however. Movies that failed to live up to studios' hopes for a competitive summer release often come out in the winter. ''Vegas Seven'''s Una LaMarche pointed at the beginning of 2013 to the then-upcoming ''[[Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters]]'' as such a film. "If [it] were any good," she wrote, "it would be coming out in June."&lt;ref name="Vegas Seven article" /&gt; It indeed fared poorly in the U.S., but better abroad.&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo Hansel &amp; Gretel page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hanselandgretelwitchhunters.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=April 24, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905100038/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hanselandgretelwitchhunters.htm|archivedate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also suspected that ''[[Broken City (film)|Broken City]]'', another upcoming release that starred [[Russell Crowe]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] and [[Mark Wahlberg]], had been consigned to a January release due to adverse reactions from [[test screening|test audiences]], and correctly anticipated the failure of the ensemble comedy ''[[Movie 43]]'' for the same reason.&lt;ref name="Vegas Seven article" /&gt; For his part, Meslow points to ''[[Season of the Witch (2011 film)|Season of the Witch]]'', a $40 million horror film starring [[Nicolas Cage]] which failed to recoup even that amount,&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt; and ''[[Untraceable]]'' as emblematic of that kind of big-budget bust buried during dump months.&lt;ref name="Atlantic post" /&gt; "The [[marketing plan]] for a film like this is often just a formal [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]], the last stop before a film's reincarnation as generic product for the [[Video on demand|on-demand]]/[[DVD]]/[[Streaming media|streaming]] [[Aftermarket (merchandise)|after-markets]]," says Burr in his ''Times Magazine'' piece.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

Others that were not originally intended for the dump months get shifted there anyway not because they are bad but because the studios cannot figure out how to market them or are not sure they will succeed. [[C. Robert Cargill]], a former critic for [[Ain't It Cool News]] who scripted the successful 2012 horror film ''[[Sinister (film)|Sinister]]'', points to ''[[Chronicle (film)|Chronicle]]'', which had a surprisingly strong opening on [[Super Bowl Sunday|Super Bowl weekend]] earlier that year, an example.&lt;ref name="Hollywood.com article" /&gt;

Similarly, LaMarche points to two other types of movies difficult to market to large audiences. "Winter can be a boon to little movies with niche audiences," she writes, pointing to [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s directorial debut, ''[[Quartet (2012 film)|Quartet]]'', which received a limited U.S. release in January 2013, and ''[[Struck by Lightning (2012 film)|Struck by Lightning]]'', released at the same time. Movies that also blend genres or defy such categorization, such as the [[List of zombie films|zombie]]–human ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' retelling, ''[[Warm Bodies]]'', or the limited-release [[Charlie Sheen]] comedy ''[[A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III]]'', are also ideal for their dump-months release time frame.&lt;ref name="Vegas Seven article" /&gt;

===August===

''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' had the most successful August opening weekend ever, until 2016's ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo August opening weekends" /&gt; It went on to become the highest grossing August release ever&lt;ref name="BOM August releases"&gt;{{cite web|title=Box Office Mojo Monthly Results: August|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/monthly/?view=releasedate&amp;chart=bymonth&amp;month=8&amp;sort=sumgross&amp;order=DESC&amp;p=.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as 2014's top-grossing film domestically.&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo 2014 top grosses" /&gt; These accomplishments led industry observers to reconsider whether they should be so dismissive of August, a trend that had been building even before that year. Cary Carling noted afterwards in the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'' that recent Augusts had seen a number of critical and commercial successes, not only franchise movies such as ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' and ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]'' but films that appealed to adult audiences such as ''[[Blue Jasmine]]'', ''[[The Help (film)|The Help]]'', and the [[James Brown]] [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Get on Up (film)|Get on Up]]'', whose $14 million opening weekend against ''Guardians'' "met expectations."&lt;ref name="Star-Telegram August story" /&gt;

"[Is] the summer movie season ... expanding out from its traditional boundaries?" Jordan Smith asked before the month began on ''[[Hollywood.com]]''. He noted that some big-budget movies released in the late spring and early summer of recent years, like ''[[After Earth]]'', ''[[White House Down]]'', ''[[R.I.P.D.]]'' and ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]'', had struggled at the box office against similar competition. He believed a "point of saturation" had been reached, with too many of those movies being released in the early summer. But "audiences are proving that they'll line up at any time of the year to watch [[Captain America]] save the day."&lt;ref name="Summer movie season over?" /&gt;

Dave Farger of [[Fandango.com]] believes moviegoers are already adapting. When a film like ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' comes out at the time of summer it does, "[it] feels like an event, regardless of the month." He sees it as similar to what has happened to the TV schedule, where both broadcast and cable networks have begun airing new scripted shows during the summer, which was once relegated to reruns due to small audiences.&lt;ref name="Star-Telegram August story" /&gt; 

Hopes for more success in late August are dependent, however, on new releases during the month. In 2017, with only two new studio films in wide release that August, the last weekend of the month yielded the worst box office results in 16 years, with all films taking in only $65 million, led by ''[[The Hitman's Bodyguard]]'', at $10.1 million in receipts, for the second straight week. Around $1.7 million of the total came from ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'', [[rerelease]]d to promote its upcoming home media debut.&lt;ref name="USA Today August 2017 story" /&gt;

===Horror films===

One genre regularly mentioned in connection with the dump months is [[horror film|horror]]. Once a staple of the periods, yet frequently limited to them, recent successes during the dump months have actually led studios to reevaluate this scheduling limitation and release horror movies at other times of the year.&lt;ref name="Complex October story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today October 2013 story" /&gt; "It seems this time of the year has become the 'other October.'" said Brian Salisbury of [[Hollywood.com]] at the end of February 2013.&lt;ref name="Hollywood.com article" /&gt; LaMarche attributes this to winter's "cold, dark landscape."&lt;ref name="Vegas Seven article" /&gt;
[[File:Old Burying Ground, Lexington MA.jpg|thumb|left|Winter's dreariness may make audiences more amenable to horror films during that season's dump months.|alt=Gravestones on a cloudy and snowy day]]
Critically praised and commercially successful horror films such as 2008's ''[[Cloverfield]]'', which had the best January opening weekend for six years until ''[[Ride Along (film)|Ride Along]]'',&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo January opening weekends table"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Opening Weekends by Month—January|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/month/?mo=01&amp;p=.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|year=2014|accessdate=March 12, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905111600/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/month/?mo=01&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013's January champion ''[[Mama (2013 film)|Mama]]'', have done well by the dump months. But other horror movies have still succeeded in the face of critical condemnation, starting with ''[[White Noise (film)|White Noise]]'' in 2005. As a result, "the only new release is usually one crappy horror movie," on the year's first weekend, says Will Goss of [[Film.com]].&lt;ref name="Hollywood.com article" /&gt;

In reviewing 2016's ''[[The Forest (2016 film)|The Forest]]'', David Ehrlich of ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]'' took note of its release at that time of year. "[A]nybody with access to a calendar already knows that ''The Forest'' is bad," he wrote. "[A]t this point, that's less of a presumption than it is a tradition." In that vein, playing on the movie's Japanese setting, he likened it to the supposed ancient custom of ''[[ubasute]]'' in that country, by which elderly people who could no longer care for themselves were purposely abandoned on mountainsides.&lt;ref name="Slate The Forest review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ehrlich|first=David|title=The Forest|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2016/01/horror_movie_the_forest_starring_natalie_dormer_reviewed.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=January 8, 2016|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[The Devil Inside (film)|The Devil Inside]]'', a low-budget [[found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] horror film following in the steps of ''Cloverfield'', opened the weekend after [[New Year's Day]]. Critics, for whom it had not been screened, reviewed it harshly if and when they did see it, and audiences reacted angrily to the film's abrupt ending, which directed them to a website for more information.&lt;ref name="Slate Devil Inside ending article"&gt;{{cite web|last=Haglund|first=David|title=Does The Devil Inside Have the Worst Ending in Movie History?|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/01/09/the_devil_inside_ending_is_it_the_worst_ever_and_why_do_people_hate_it_.html|website=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=January 9, 2012|accessdate=January 3, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928121858/http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/01/09/the_devil_inside_ending_is_it_the_worst_ever_and_why_do_people_hate_it_.html|archivedate=September 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, as Cargill notes, its success was proof that even on that low-potential weekend, a disengaged audience will "throw money at a terrible movie if it looks like it's good."&lt;ref name="Hollywood.com article" /&gt; The film's opening weekend take of $33.7 million ranks in the top ten for January.&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo January opening weekends table" /&gt; ''The Devil Inside'' went on to make over $50 million domestically and almost that much abroad to break $100 million in total receipts.&lt;ref name="Box Office Mojo Devil Inside summary" /&gt;

The success of both films outside of October, usually the month when studios released their quality horror films to capitalize on [[Halloween]]'s approach, has actually led studios to rethink that approach and release horror films at other times of year. During the 2000s October, and the weekend before Halloween, had come to be dominated by the ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' and ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' [[media franchise|franchises]]. "You would never come up against them because you would be killed," recalls Rock Alvarez, producer of ''[[A Haunted House 2]]''.&lt;ref name="USA Today October 2013 story" /&gt;

For that reason, ''Mama'' was rescheduled from October 2012 to the following January. In October 2013, Paramount decided to delay the release of ''[[Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones]]'' from the weekend before Halloween to March 2014, and replaced it not with another horror offering but the comedy ''[[Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa]]'', leaving the month with only one highly anticipated horror film, the third adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Carrie (2013 film)|Carrie]]''.&lt;ref name="USA Today October 2013 story" /&gt;

Tiffany Smith of [[Fandango.com]]'s House of Screams says studios are finding holidays with horror associations elsewhere in the year, like [[Friday the 13th]], regardless of season. ''[[Insidious: Chapter 2]]'' had actually opened well on that weekend in September. "That weekend actually played as a bigger movie weekend than Halloween is this year," she told ''[[USA Today]]''. In July, ''[[The Conjuring]]'' had also done well amidst the summer movies. "A lot of people are moving [horror movies] everywhere," said ''Mama'' producer [[Guillermo del Toro]].&lt;ref name="USA Today October 2013 story" /&gt;

==Audience and critical responses==

Some movie critics have called on the studios to change their release schedules and improve the quality of new films during the dump months. Paul Shirey of [[JoBlo.com]] calls on the studios start releasing better films then. "Rather than saving them to win statues, why not put them out to reap some box office and fill an otherwise dead month with something worth seeing?"&lt;ref name="JoBlo.com article" /&gt;

[[Ty Burr]] suggested that in January 2013 that no new movies should be released in January. Instead, "studios would have to rerelease their most underrated entertainments from the previous year for a second chance." He gave ''[[The Cabin in the Woods]]'' or ''[[Chronicle (film)|Chronicle]]'', itself a January release in 2012, as examples of such films. Failing that happening, he wrote that he was using home media to catch up on older films.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

Other critics have tried to look for worthwhile, overlooked films amid the dump-months releases, which do exist, Vegas Seven's Una LaMarche assures readers.&lt;ref name="Vegas Seven article" /&gt; In January 2013, ''[[The Onion]]'''s ''[[The A.V. Club|A.V. Club]]'' compiled a list of such overlooked dump months films. It includes many that have since become [[cult classic]]s, like the 1991 [[Kevin Bacon]] horror film ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]'', 1999's ''[[Office Space (film)|Office Space]]'' and 2000's ''[[Boiler Room (film)|Boiler Room]]'', all released in late February. They also recommend the January 1993 release ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'', starring [[John Goodman]] as legendary gimmick-using film producer [[William Castle]], and ''[[The Pledge (film)|The Pledge]]'', a January 2001 film starring [[Jack Nicholson]]. "It is [[Sean Penn]]'s best film as director, an uncompromising depiction of faith and devotion curdled into something monstrous."&lt;ref name="AV Club article" /&gt;

One critic, Matt Singer of ''[[indieWIRE]]'', said in January 2013 that he has "started to look at January with anticipation rather than dread." He argues that even the month's bad movies are bad in their own way. Unlike failed summer blockbusters, which have "way too much money riding on [them] to be anything but mediocre and boring," January movies are often spectacular in their failure since the studios do not expect them to do well. "Why throw good money after bad?" he asks rhetorically. "Just cut your losses and let the thing really suck." Such [[benign neglect]], he suggests, led to ''[[The Devil Inside (film)|The Devil Inside]]'', "so intensely stupid it's almost brilliant—and entirely entertaining." He likened January movies to [[trainwreck]]s, while bad movies in June were more like "[[Demolition|controlled demolition]]s."&lt;ref name="Matt Singer indieWIRE piece"&gt;{{cite web|last=Singer|first=Matt|title=Why I Love Going to the Movies in January|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/criticwire/january-movies|publisher=[[indieWIRE]]|date=January 23, 2013|accessdate=January 5, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040924/http://blogs.indiewire.com/criticwire/january-movies|archivedate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cloverfield]]'', he asserted, had begun reversing the trend of forgettable January movies. In more recent years he had been impressed by ''[[The Grey (film)|The Grey]]'' and ''[[Mama (2013 film)|Mama]].''&lt;ref name="Matt Singer indieWIRE piece" /&gt;

"While it's easy to complain about a stretch of so-so movies," wrote Matt Patches at [[Hollywood.com]] as 2012 began, "the twist is we should really be ''thanking'' the studios for catering to niche audiences all month." For most viewers, it is a chance to catch up on the major awards contenders released in December. But studios and the filmgoers who have already seen those two films can benefit from creative risk-taking by filmmakers. He points to ''Cloverfield'' as one such gamble that succeeded. Smaller film distributors also take advantage of the dump months to bring little-seen but highly praised films like ''[[Kill List]]'' to wider audiences via home-media releases.&lt;ref name="January 2012 Hollywood.com post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Patches|first=Matt|title=MindFood: Why January Is the Year's Best Month for Movies|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/movies/12851710/mindfood-why-january-is-the-year-s-best-month-for-movies|publisher=[[Hollywood.com]]|date=January 4, 2012|accessdate=January 7, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107065209/http://www.hollywood.com/news/movies/12851710/mindfood-why-january-is-the-year-s-best-month-for-movies|archivedate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' said in January 2014 that only critics in large markets have reason to complain during the dump months. "For the rest" he claimed "January is in fact a deluge of high quality movies" owing to the combination of awards contenders reaching the mass market for the first time, the possibility for unusual successes among the new releases, and overlooked films from the previous year reaching home markets. In that last category, he highly recommended the August 2013 release ''[[Short Term 12]]''.&lt;ref name="Forbes January 2014 post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendelson|first=Scott|title=January Is Only The Worst Month For Film If You're A Critic|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2014/01/02/why-january-really-isnt-the-worst-month-for-movies/|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=January 2, 2014|accessdate=January 7, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313022819/http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2014/01/02/why-january-really-isnt-the-worst-month-for-movies/|archivedate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other markets==

Until 2010, the [[Cinema of China|Chinese film industry]] also experienced sluggish domestic ticket sales during January and February, when that country celebrates the traditional [[Chinese New Year|New Year]], or today the Spring Festival. That year, [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' earned US$16 million in one week during that period, leading Chinese filmmakers to reconsider whether audiences were as disinterested in going to theaters at that time of year than they had long believed. They began to make movies that might succeed during this period, realizing that the country's [[Chinese economic reform#Economic performance since reform|recent economic growth]] had given people more leisure time.&lt;ref name="LAT Chinese New Year story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fan|first=Kemeng|title=China's box office sets record during Spring Festival|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-china-box-office-new-year-20180222-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 22, 2018|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, that period has become more profitable. Most of the successful films have been domestic productions—no Hollywood production has been released in China during the Spring Festival since ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' in 2014. A Chinese critic told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that she believes Hollywood deliberately refrains from releasing its major films in her country during this time since they now know the market will be saturated with high-profile domestic films, much as China itself informally excludes foreign-made films from the summer months.&lt;ref name="LAT Chinese New Year story" /&gt;

In February 2018 the Spring Festival period set new box office records for China. It had its highest-grossing week ever, at {{CNY|5.65 billion|link=yes}} (US$890 billion); its highest single-day gross (US$200 million), and its highest attendance ever, with 30 million going to theaters at some point during the week in mid-month. ''[[Monster Hunt 2]]'' set the country's opening weekend record with receipts of {{CNY|550 million}} (US$86 million).&lt;ref name="LAT Chinese New Year story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CGTN 2018 Spring Festival story"&gt;{{cite news|author=Yu Fengsheng|title=New Chinese box office records set during Spring Festival|url=https://news.cgtn.com/news/304d7a4e34677a6333566d54/share_p.html|newspaper=[[CGTN (TV channel)|CGTN]]|date=February 23, 2018|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Floodplain restoration''' is the process of fully or partially restoring a river's [[floodplain]] to its original conditions before having been affected by the construction of [[levee]]s (dikes) and the draining of [[wetland]]s and [[marsh]]es. 

The objectives of restoring floodplains include the reduction of the incidence of [[flood]]s, the provision of [[habitats]] for [[Aquatic animal|aquatic species]], the improvement of [[water quality]] and the increased recharge of [[groundwater]].

==Description==
[[Image:Greffern Polder inBetrieb.jpg|thumb|Road flooded intentionally in a [[Polder#Germany|polder]] on the [[Upper Rhine]]]]
=== Europe ===
In Europe very few schemes for restoring functional floodplains have been put in practice so far, despite a surge of interest in the topic among policy and research circles. One of the drivers for floodplain restoration is the EU [[Water Framework Directive]]. Early floodplain restoration schemes were undertaken in the mid-1990s in the Rheinvorland-Süd on the Upper [[Rhine]], the [[Bourret, Tarn-et-Garonne|Bourret]] on the [[Garonne]], and as part of the [[Long Eau]] project in England. Ongoing schemes in 2007 include [[Lenzen]] on the [[Elbe]], [[La Basse]] on the [[Seine]] and the [[Parrett]] Catchment Project in England.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Timothy and Jochen Monstadt: Restoring Floodplains in Europe. Policy Contexts and Project Experiences, International Water Association 2008, {{ISBN|1-84339-090-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Elbe]] River near [[Lenzen]] (Brandenburg) 420 hectares of floodplain were restored in order to prevent a recurrence of the Elbe floods of 2002. A total of 20 floodplain restoration projects on the Elbe River were envisaged after the 2002 floods, but only two have been implemented as of 2009 according to the environmental group [[:de:BUND]].&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Europäischer Wirtscchaftsdients Wasser und Abwasser Nr. 34, August 18, 2009:Internationale Kommission zum Schutz der Elbe:Elbe-Hochwasser wie 2002 nicht mehr möglich&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]] examples of floodplain restoration can be found in the catchment area of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in Maryland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landstudies.com/legacysediments.html Land Studies:Legacy Sediments and Floodplain Restoration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514011253/http://www.landstudies.com/legacysediments.html |date=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Emiquon Project|Emiquon Preserve]] on the [[Illinois River]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/illinois/press/emiquon.html The Nature Conservancy Launches Landmark Floodplain Restoration at the Emiquon Preserve, May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Charlotte]], North Carolina &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charmeck.org/Departments/StormWater/Storm+Water+Professionals/Project+Floodplain+Restoration.htm Floodplain Restoration in Charlotte-Mecklenburg County]&lt;/ref&gt; and along the [[Baraboo River]] in Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sandcounty.net/programs/pioneers/floodplain_rehab/ Floodplain Rehabilitation along the Baraboo River] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006222835/http://www.sandcounty.net/programs/pioneers/floodplain_rehab/ |date=2008-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Martinus Arion''' ''(born '''Frank Efraim Martinus'''; 17 December 1936 &amp;ndash; 28 September 2015)'' was a [[Curaçao]]an poet, [[novelist]], and language advocate.

He moved to the Netherlands in 1955 and in 1981 returned to [[Curaçao]], where he became head of the Curaçao Language Institute that promotes the use of the [[Papiamento]] language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letterenfonds.nl/en/author/83/frank-martinus-arion "Frank Martinus Arion"], Dutch Foundation for Literature.&lt;/ref&gt; His works include ''The Last Freedom (De laatste vrijheid)'' and ''Double Play'' (''Dubbelspel)''. The latter novel is considered to be his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] and was published in 1973. He wrote in [[Papiamento]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

{{Expand Esperanto|Frederic Pujulà i Vallès|fa=yes|date=March 2009}}
'''Frederic Pujulà i Vallès''' ({{IPA-ca|fɾəðəˈɾik puʒuˈla j βəˈʎɛs}}) (12 November 1877 &amp;ndash; 14 February 1962) was a [[Catalans|Catalan]] [[journalist]], [[dramatist]], and a passionate [[Esperanto|Esperantist]] and contributor to the field of [[Esperanto literature]]. Born in [[Palamós]], [[Province of Girona|Girona]], he travelled through Europe and stayed for a long time in [[Paris]]. He was involved in ''Joventut'' (1900–1906), the best "modernisme" review of [[Catalonia]]. During [[World War I]], he fought with the French army.

Vallès wrote "Homes Artificials" (''Artificial Men'') which is the first short [[science fiction]] novel in the canon of [[Catalan literature]]. It was originally published in 1912, by Biblioteca Joventut in [[Barcelona]]. In this novel, the protagonist Doctor Pericart wants to obtain a new society, unsocialized and perfect. Transformed into a [[demigod]], he creates a group of individualized [[Android (robot)|android]]s, which will be the seeds of the new society.

In 1914, he was in Paris with his first wife, where he was organizing en International Convention of Esperanto. When that very year the 1914-1918 war broke out, he enlisted as an infantry soldier and took part at the first battles against the German army.
Later on, as he could read and write the Morse alphabet, he was transferred to Communications between detachments of the French Army. It was during this period that, as a war correspondent of the daily paper "El Diluvio" he wrote a series of articles in Spanish about how was life in the trenches.
When he returned to Barcelona, he was appointed Staff editor of that newspaper, which was favourable to a federal system for Spain.
When in 1941 the fascist armies entered into Barcelona, they closed "El Diluvio", because Franco considered Federalism to be an offense. Consequently, Frederic Pujulà Vallès was sent to prison, together with the owner of the paper and the owner's two sons.
Frederic Pujulà received the death penalty, which was two weeks later conmuted  to twenty years and one day.
At the end, he was set free two years and two months since he was imprisoned.

Vallès died in [[Bargemon]], [[France]], in 1962.

[[File:Logo iso radiation.svg|thumb|[[ISO]] radiation warning sign.]]

The field of '''[[Long-time nuclear waste warning messages|nuclear semiotics]]''' arose in 1981 when a team of engineers, anthropologists, nuclear physicists, behavioral scientists and others was convened on behalf of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] and [[Bechtel]] Corp. The goal of this "'''Human Interference Task Force'''" was to find a way to reduce the likelihood of future humans unintentionally intruding on [[radioactive waste]] isolation systems.

Specifically, the task force was to research ways to prevent future access to the planned, but stalled, [[Deep geological repository|deep geological nuclear repository]] project of [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Yucca Mountain]].

==Problem==
When atomic or fusion bombs are detonated in a war, or nuclear power plants are used in times of peace, an unnaturally high amount of radioactive waste is produced. This material will threaten human life and health for thousands of years. Consequently, nuclear technology necessitates the creation of a secure means of terminal storage for such materials for an unusually long time period.

Unfortunately, there is no method available to continuously provide the necessary knowledge about the location of nuclear waste over thousands of years. The culture of earlier centuries becomes incomprehensible when it is not translated into new languages every few generations. National institutions do not exist longer than a few hundred years. Even religions are not older than a few millennia and do not typically hand down scientific knowledge.

Furthermore, the necessary length of storage is disputed among specialists. One work group in Germany concluded that nuclear waste must be separated from the biosphere up to one million years&amp;nbsp;– about 30,000 human generations{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Earlier assumptions were based on a period of 10,000 years, which seems to be too short given the half-life of certain radioactive isotopes (e.g. [[Plutonium]]-239 at 24,000 years).

The written historical tradition of humanity, in contrast, is only about 5000 years. Warnings in [[cuneiform script]] could be interpreted by some specialists, but others, such as the writing of the [[Indus Valley civilization]], are already illegible after a few thousand years.

==Proposals==
Three parts of any [[Long-time nuclear waste warning messages|communication about nuclear waste]] must be conveyed to posterity:
#that it is a message at all
#that dangerous material is stored in a given location
#information about the type of dangerous substances

==Answers==
To determine how to convey these three things, the "''Zeitschrift für Semiotik''" ([[Tübingen]], Germany) issued a poll in 1982 and 1983 asking how a message might be communicated for a duration of 10,000 years. The poll asked the following question: "''How would it be possible to inform our descendants for the next 10,000 years about the storage locations and dangers of radioactive waste?" ''leading to the following answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |title=Und in alle Ewigkeit: Kommunikation über 10 000 Jahre: Wie sagen wir unsern Kindeskindern wo der Atommüll liegt?|journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|trans-title=And into Eternity... Communication over 10000s of Years: How Will We Tell our Children's Children Where the Nuclear Waste is?|location=Berlin|language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Sebeok===
The linguist [[Thomas Sebeok]] was a member of the [[Bechtel Corporation|Bechtel]] working group. Building on earlier suggestions made by [[Alvin Weinberg]] and [[Arsen Darnay]] he proposed the creation of an ''atomic priesthood'', a panel of experts where members would be replaced through nominations by a council. Similar to the [[Catholic church]] - which has preserved and authorized its message for over 2000 years&amp;nbsp;— the ''atomic priesthood'' would have to preserve the knowledge about locations and dangers of radioactive waste by creating rituals and myths. The priesthood would indicate off-limits areas and the consequences of disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Thomas |last1=Sebeok|publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |trans-title=Pandora's box and its protection:   A relay system in the care of an atom priesthood|journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|title=Die Büchse der Pandora und ihre Sicherung: Ein Relaissystem in der Obhut einer Atompriesterschaft    |location=Berlin |language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~g.legrady/academic/courses/01sp200a/students/enricaLovaglio/pandora/Pandora.html|title=Pandora's Box: How and Why to Communicate 10,000 Years into the Future|website=www.mat.ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach has a number of critical problems:
#An ''atomic priesthood'' would gain political influence based on the contingencies that it would oversee.
#This system of information favors the creation of hierarchies.
#The message could be split into independent parts.
#Information about waste sites would grant power to a privileged class. People from outside this group might attempt to seize this information by force.

===Stanisław Lem===
Polish science-fiction author [[Stanisław Lem]] proposed the creation of [[satellites|artificial satellites]] that would transmit information from their orbit to Earth for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stanisław |last1=Lem|publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |title=Mathematische Kodierung auf lebendem Trägermaterial |journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|trans-title=Mathematical coding on living carrier material   |location=Berlin|language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also described a biological coding of [[DNA]] in a mathematical sense, which would reproduce itself automatically. ''Information Plants'' would only grow near a terminal storage site and would inform humans about the dangers. The DNA of the so-called atomic flowers would contain the necessary data about both the location and its contents.

Lem acknowledged the problem with his idea that humans would be unlikely to know the meaning of atomic flowers 10,000 years later, and thus unlikely to decode their DNA in a search for information.

===Françoise Bastide and Paolo Fabbri===
French author [[Françoise Bastide]] and the Italian semiotician Paolo Fabbri proposed the breeding of so called ''"radiation cats"'' or ''"ray cats"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Françoise|last1=Bastide|first2=Paolo |last2=Fabbri|publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |title=Lebende Detektoren und komplementäre Zeichen: Katzen, Augen und Sirenen |journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|trans-title=Living detectors and complimentary signs: Cats, eyes and sirens |location=Berlin|language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/27476/ray-cats-artificial-moons-and-atomic-priesthood-how-government-plans-protect-our|title=Ray Cats, Artificial Moons and the Atomic Priesthood: How the Government Plans to Protect Our Nuclear Waste|last=Kaufman|first=Rachel|date=2011|website=Mental Floss|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theraycatsolution.com/|title=Ray Cat Solution|website=10,000|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techinsider.io/the-plan-to-protect-humans-from-radioactive-waste-with-cats-2015-8|title=Color-changing cats were once part of a US government plan to protect humankind|last=Schwartz|first=Ariel|date=August 16, 2015|website=Tech Insider|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cat]]s have a long history of cohabitation with humans, and this approach assumes that their domestication will continue indefinitely. These radiation cats would change significantly in color when they came near radioactive emissions and serve as living indicators of danger. In order to transport the message, the importance of the cats would need to be set in the collective awareness through fairy tales and myths. Those fairy tales and myths in turn could be transmitted through poetry, music and painting. The story of this original project was depicted in the 2016 short documentary "The Ray Cat Solution".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/138843064|title=The Raycat Solution|last=Huguet|first=Benjamin|year=2016|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vilmos Voigt===
Vilmos Voigt from Loránd-Eötvös university ([[Budapest]]) proposed the installation of warning signs in the most important global languages in a concentric pattern around the terminal storage location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Vilmos |last1=Voigt |publisher=Deutschen Gesellschaft für Semiotik|url=http://www.semiotik.tu-berlin.de/menue/zeitschrift_fuer_semiotik/zs-hefte/bd_6_hft_3/ |title=Konzentrisch angeordnete Warntafeln in zunehmend neueren Sprachformen |journal=Zeitschrift für Semiotik |volume=6 |issue=3|year= 1984|trans-title=Concentrically arranged warning signs in increasingly newer language forms |location=Berlin|language=German|issn=0170-6241}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a certain time span new signs with translations would be installed, but the old signs would not be removed. Newer signs would be posted farther away from the location, thus the warning would be understandable as languages change and it would be possible to understand the older languages through the translation.

===Emil Kowalski===
Physicist Emil Kowalski from [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], [[Switzerland]] proposed that terminal storage locations be constructed in such a way that future generations could reach them only with a high technical ability. The probability of an unwanted breach would then become extremely small. Furthermore, cultures able to perform such excavations and drillings would most certainly be able to detect radioactive material and be aware of its dangers.

He often resided for months at a time in the houses of such of the Irish gentry as desired to acquire a knowledge of the French tongue. 

He mixed in the political agitations of the period, and on 26 April 1784 was elected an honorary member of the [[Sons of the Shamrock]]; and is said in 1795 to have joined in the invitation to the French government to invade Ireland. In his later years he resided at Leinster Lodge, near [[Athy]], [[County Kildare]]. The date of his death is not given; but he was buried in the old churchyard at [[Palmerstown]].

He had at least one child, [[Louis Perrin]], a judge, who was born at [[Waterford]] in 1782. 

==Published works==
He was the author of: 
*''The French Student's Vade-mecum'', London, 1750.
*''Grammar of the French Tongue'', 1768.
*''Fables Amusantes'', 1771.
*''Entertaining and Instructive Exercises, with the Rules of the French Syntax'', 1773.
*''The Elements of French Conversation, with Dialogues'', 1774.
*''Lettres Choisies sur toutes sortes de sujet'', 1777.
*''The Practice of the French Pronunciation alphabetically exhibited'', 1777.
*''La Bonne Mère, contenant de petites pièces dramatiques'', 1786.
*''The Elements of English Conversation, with a Vocabulary in French, English, and Italian'', Naples, 1814. 

The majority of these works went to many editions, and the ''Fables'' were adapted to the [[James Hamilton (language teacher)|Hamiltonian system]] in 1825.

According to [[Urban Dictionary]], a Jejemon is a person "who has managed to subvert the English language to the point of incomprehensibility." &lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;{{cite web|date=2010-04-26 |title=Jejemon in the Philippines |first=Joseph |last=Nacino |url=http://asia.cnet.com/blogs/the-virtual-eye/post.htm?id=63018444&amp;scid=hm_bl |work=[[CNET]] Asia |accessdate=2010-04-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828171747/http://asia.cnet.com/blogs/jejemon-in-the-philippines-62116449.htm |archivedate=2012-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' describes Jejemons as a "new breed of [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] who have {{sic|hide=y}} developed not only their own language and written text but also their own subculture and fashion."&lt;ref name="MB 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PDI"&gt;{{cite web|date=2010-04-24 |title=&gt;Jejemons: The new ‘jologs’ |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/2bu/2bu/view/20100424-266068/gtJejemons-The-new-jologs |accessdate=2010-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427084817/http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/2bu/2bu/view/20100424-266068/gtJejemons-The-new-jologs |archivedate=2010-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The origins of short-handed typing was through the [[short messaging service]], in which each text message sent by a cellphone is limited to 160 characters, evident in popular phone models in the early 2000s  such as [[Nokia 5110]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Myx Magazine|last=Carag|first=Elaine|publisher=ABS-CBN Publishing, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=Quezon City, Philippines|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an "[[SMS language]]" developed in which words were shortened in order to fit the 160-character limit. However, some jejemons are not really "conserving" characters; instead, they are lengthening their message.&lt;ref name="MB 1"&gt;{{cite web|date=2010-04-27 |title=How do you solve a problem like the Jejemons? |first=Ronald |last=Lim |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915034630/http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/254784/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-jejemons|archivedate=2012-09-15|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/254784/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-jejemons |work=The [[Manila Bulletin]] |accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, 2010, on a Pinoy [[Tumblr]], a post about [[Philippine presidential election, 2010|vice presidential candidate]] [[Jejomar Binay]] indicated that he was the Jejemon's preferred vice presidential candidate, complete with a fake poster with him called as "Makki Autors". Later the use of word ''jejemon'' to refer to such people made rounds in various Filipino [[internet message board]]s.&lt;ref name="MB 1"/&gt;

The word Jejemon is a [[portmanteau]] of the Japanese animated series, [[Pokémon]], and ''hehe'' is an expression of laughter.

Such short-handed language is not limited to Filipinos: [[Thai people|Thai]]s use "5555" to denote "hahahaha," since [[Thai numerals#Zero to nine|the number 5]] in [[Thai language]] is pronounced as "ha."&lt;ref name="PDI"/&gt;

==Demographics==
The Jejemons are said to be the new ''jologs'', a term used for Filipinos of the lower income class.&lt;ref name="CNET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PDI"/&gt; The parameters of being classified as a Jejemon are still unclear, and how the different "levels" of "Jejemonism" are reached,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideLifestyle.htm?f=2010/april/30/lifestyle4.isx&amp;d=2010/april/30 |title=The jejemon phenom |date=2010-04-30 |first=Ed |last=Biado |work=[[Manila Standard Today]] |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are named levels such as "mild," "moderate" and "severe" or "terminal."&lt;ref name="24 Oras"&gt;{{cite web|date=2010-04-29 |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/largevideo/latest/59213/the-jejemon-phenomenon-what-do-language-experts-say |title=The jejemon phenomenon: What do language experts say?  |work=GMANews.tv |accessdate=2010-05-01|language=Tagalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The [[sociolect]] of the Jejemons, called ''Jejenese'', is derived from English, [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and their [[Code-switching|code-switched variant]], [[Taglish]]. It has its own, albeit unofficial, orthography, known as ''Jejebet'', which uses the Filipino variant of the [[Roman alphabet]], [[Arabic numerals]] and other special characters. Words are created by rearranging letters in a word, [[CamelCase|alternating capitalization]], over-usage of the letters H, X or Z.&lt;ref name="PDI"/&gt; Superfluous as well as the presence of [[silent letter]]s characterize its spelling convention. It has similarities with [[Leet]]speak, primarily the alphanumeric nature of its writing.

==Perceived usefulness==
IT and information security experts have found a certain usefulness of "jejetyping" in the creation of strong passwords for user logins.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Reaction==
Several Facebook fan pages were created both in support and against the group. Celebrities such as [[Alessandra de Rossi]], [[Ces Drilon]], and [[Lourd de Veyra]] have condemned the wholesale ridicule of the subculture.&lt;ref name="MB 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wordofthelourd"&gt;{{Cite web|last=de Veyra |first=Lourd |authorlink=Lourd de Veyra |title=Lourd de Veyra: Attack, Jejemons, Attack! |publisher=spot.ph |date=29 April 2010 |url=http://www.spot.ph/2010/04/29/lourd-de-veyra-attack-jejemons-attack/ |accessdate=May 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514075335/http://www.spot.ph/2010/04/29/lourd-de-veyra-attack-jejemons-attack/ |archivedate=14 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the sudden existence of jejemons, 'Jejebusters' were created, a group of [[Grammar Nazi|internet grammar vigilantes]], typically Filipinos, dedicating their internet lives towards the eradication of jejetyping and jejemon existence.

[[YouTube]] videos were also uploaded parodying the Jejemons, connecting them to the [[Philippine general election, 2010|2010 election campaign]]. Edited television advertisements of [[Nacionalista Party]] proclaiming their disdain, and an [[photo manipulation|edited]] photograph of [[Gilberto Teodoro]] with him holding a sign saying that the Jejemons should be "brought back to elementary school" went viral.&lt;ref name="ABS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/05/01/10/anti-jejemon-campaign-goes-viral-web |title='Anti-jejemon' campaign goes viral on the web |author=Faye Monchelle Gonzalez and Cherry Anne M. Mungcal |date=2010-05-01 |accessdate=2010-05-01 |work=ABS-CBNnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Filipino [[GMA Network]] broadcast the situational comedy ''[[JejeMom]]'', headlined by [[Eugene Domingo]].

As part of the pre-school year clean-up of schools for the upcoming 2010–11 school year, the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] (DepEd) strongly discourages students from using Jejemon spelling and grammar, especially in text messaging. Communicating with others using Jejemon "language" is said to cause deterioration of young Filipino students’ language skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/191566/deped-seeks-to-purge-schools-of-jejemon-mentality |title='DepEd seeks to purge schools of ‘jejemon’ mentality |date=2010-05-22 |accessdate=2010-05-25 |work=GMANews.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline and a change of definition==
From early 2013 onwards, with the rise of [[smartphone]]s which began to overtake [[feature phone]]s in terms of sales in the country, the phenomenon seems to have made a gradual decline in mainstream popularity. Some social media accounts use such spellings to this date, but most of them are used for sarcasm particularly by . The term "jejemon" would gradually shift definition to a [[pejorative]] term to describe a stereotype of poorly educated young people wearing [[hip hop fashion|hip-hop clothing]], roughly similar to the British slang term [[chav]] for sportswear. As of 2017, the Jejemon are also called "hypebeasts" and are recognizable for wearing counterfeit [[skateboarding]] or car culture-related brands.

The '''Kanowit''' language, also called '''Serau Tet Kanowit''' (language of the Kanowit people), is an [[Austronesian language]] spoken in [[Sarawak]], Malaysia on the island of Borneo. It is mutually intelligible with the '''Tanjong''' (alternatively spelled ''Tanjung'') language, which is spoken even farther upriver near the town of Kapit. Tanjong may be a separate language from Kanowit; however, both languages currently share the denomination ''kxn'' in [[ISO 639-3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://endangeredlanguages.com/lang/4258|title=Kanowit-Tanjong|last=|first=|date=2016|website=The Endangered Languages Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanowit is primarily spoken in Kampung Bedil, a village located approximately one mile up the [[Rajang River]] from [[Kanowit|Kanowit Town]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Languages of Borneo: A Comprehensive Classification|last=Smith|first=Alexander D.|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|year=2017|isbn=|location=Honolulu, HI|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Kannada poets in Hoysala Empire}}
'''Kēśirāja''', also spelled '''Keshiraja''' ({{lang-kn|ಕೇಶಿರಾಜ}}), was a 13th-century [[Kannada language|Kannada]] grammarian, poet and writer. He is particularly known for authoring ''[[Shabdamanidarpana]]'', an authoritative work on Kannada grammar. According to Dravidian scholar [[Sheldon Pollock]], because of this work he is considered the "greatest theorist of Kannada grammar".{{sfn|Pollock|2003|p=364}} He was also a scholar in Sanskrit as well and a court poet (''Aasthaana kavi'') in the [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysala]] Court.

==Early life==
Kesiraja was born in a literary family, comprising several well-known [[Kannada literature|Kannada]] writers. His father, Mallikarjuna (C. 1245 CE), was a Kannada poet and brother-in-law of the epic writer [[Janna]].{{sfn|Rice|1982|p=44–45}} Kesiraja was also the grandson on his mother's side of another noted poet, Śankara (Sumanōbana), who was priest of the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri|Yadava]] capital and poet laureate to [[Hoysala]] King [[Narasimha I]]. In some of his works, Kesiraja has referred to himself as ''Kesava''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 6: Chalukyas of Badami |url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/History-I/chapter_6.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301213237/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/History-I/chapter_6.pdf |archivedate= 1 March 2011 |df= |work=Maharashtra State Gazetteer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shabdamanidarpana==
{{Main article|Shabdamanidarpana}}
''[[Shabdamanidarpana]]'' ({{lang-kn|ಶಬ್ದಮಣಿದರ್ಪಣ}}), ("Jewel-mirror of Grammar") was authored by Kesiraja in 1260 CE. This work remains a comprehensive, authoritative work on Kannada grammar.&lt;ref name="History of the Kannada Literature -III"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/kar/literature/history3.htm |title=History of the Kannada Literature -III |website=Kamat's Potpourri |first=Jyotsna|last=Kamat|accessdate=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rice|1982|p=111}} The rules mentioned therein were penned in ''kanda'' metre and followed a ''vrutti'' style (illustrative commentary by the author himself).{{sfn|Rice|1982|p=111}}{{sfn|Sastri|2002|p=359}} Though Kesiraja followed the model of Sanskrit grammar of the Katantra school, and that of earlier writings on Kannada grammar, his work has an originality of its own.&lt;ref name="Sahitya Akademi"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |title= Encyclopaedia of Indian literature |volume=2 |year=1988|publisher= [[Sahitya Akademi]]|location= |isbn=81-260-1194-7|page=1476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of ''Shabdamanidarpana'' begins with poetry ehalting earlier generations of writer who are cited by Kesiraja as authoritative examples:

{{Quote|The expert way (sumārgam) of Gajaga, Gunanandi, Manasija, [[Asaga]], Candrabhatta, Gunavarma, Srivijaya, Honna (Ponna), Hampa (Pampa), Sujanōttamsa{{spaced ndash}}these provide the illustrative instances (''lakshya'') in this work. 
In ''Shabdamanidarpana'', about twenty poets and thirty different works are cited, and almost every rule is explained with quotations. This work points out the Kannada language development through the preceding three centuries.|Kesiraja (translated)}}

An attempt at vocabulary building is provided in several parts of the work. There is a list of verbal roots and words containing ḷ and ḹ sounds. There is also a chapter called "PrayŌgasāra" where Kesiraja has quoted a number of rare words along with their meanings.&lt;ref name="Mishra"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lexicography in India : Proceedings of the First National Conference on Dictionary Making in Indian Languages|author=Bal Govind Misra|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passion for grammar==
Kesiraja had a passion for grammar, which is evident from his writings through his work ''[[Shabdamanidarpana]]''.
{{Quote|Through grammar (correct) words originate; through the words of that grammar, meaning (originates); through meaning the beholding of truth; through the beholding of truth, the desired final beatitude; this (final beatitude) is the fruit for the learned.| sūtra 10 of the Preface, ''Shabdamanidarpana''{{spaced ndash}}Kesiraja{{sfn|Kittel|1903|p=4}}}}

==Literary works==
Apart from his extant grammar ''Shabdamanidarpana'', Kesiraja authored several other writings in Kannada, though they are deemed lost:&lt;ref name="Sahitya Akademi" /&gt;
* ''Prabodhachandra'' (ಪ್ರಬೋಧಚಂದ್ರ)
* ''Chorapalaka Charitam'' (ಚೋರಪಾಲಕ ಚರಿತ)
* ''Kiratam'' (or ''Kiratarjuniyam'') (ಕಿರಾತ)
* ''Shubhadraharana'' (ಸುಭದ್ರಾ ಹರಣ)
* ''Sri Chitramale'' (ಶ್ರೀ ಚಿತ್ರಮಾಲೆ)

'''Kumyk''' (къумукъ тил,&lt;ref name="languagesoftheworld"&gt;L. S. Levitskaya, "Kumyk language", in ''Languages of the world. Turkic languages'' (1997). (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; ''qumuq til'') is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]], spoken by about 426,212&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omniglot.com/writing/kumyk.php&lt;/ref&gt; speakers — the [[Kumyks]] — in the [[Dagestan]], [[North Ossetia-Alania|North Ossetia]], and [[Chechnya|Chechen]] republics of the [[Russian Federation]].

== Origin ==
Kumyks speak Kumyk language, which is a part of Kipchak-Cuman language subfamily of the [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]] family of the [[Turkic languages]]. It's an inheritant of the [[Khazar language|Khazar]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;Baskakov N.A. Введение в изучение тюркских языков. М., 1962, с. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundament of the Kumyk language formed in 7th-10th centuries on the roots of [[Khazars|Khazar]] and [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] [[Stratum (linguistics)|substratum]], and mixed afterwards with [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] and [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]] stratum.&lt;ref&gt;PhD Philologist Khangishiev D. Этногенез кумыков в свете лингвистических данных (http://kumukia.ru/author?q=1088)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolai Baskakov (linguist)|Nikolay Baskakov]], based on a famous scripture [[Codex Cumanicus|Codex Cimanicus]], included modern Kumyk, [[Karachay-Balkar language|Karachai-Balkar]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Karaim language|Karaim]], and the language of [[Mamluk|Mamluk Kipchak]] in the same with [[Kipchak languages|Cuman-Kipchak]] lingual family. [[Alexander Samoylovich|Samoylovich]] also considered Cuman-Kipchak close to Kumyk and Karachai-Balkar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Абибуллаева С. |editor=  |format= |url= http://dspace.nbuv.gov.ua/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/36685/02-Abibullaeva.pdf?sequence=1 |title= "Кодекс Куманикус" – ПАМЯТНИК ТЮРКСКИХ ЯЗЫКОВ КОНЦА XIII – НАЧАЛА XIV ВЕКОВ |type=  |origyear= | agency =  |edition=   |location=  |date=   |year=  |publisher=  |at=  |volume=  |issue=  |number= |pages =  |page=  |series=  |isbn =  |issn =  |doi =  |bibcode =  |arxiv =  |pmid =  |ref=  |language= русский |quote=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, Timofey Makarov, a professor of "Caucasian Tatar" (Kumyk), published the first ever grammatical book of the language, praising its distinct precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://caucasian.space/qum/adabiyat_qumuq_posts/2016-12-28-qumuq-grammar-makarov.html|title=Kafkaz Lehçeni Tatar Grammatikası, Makarov 1848|last=|first=|date=|website=caucasian.space|language=kumyk, russian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107011252/http://caucasian.space/qum/adabiyat_qumuq_posts/2016-12-28-qumuq-grammar-makarov.html|archive-date=2017-11-07|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{БСЭ3|статья=Кумыкский язык}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Script ==
Kumyk is an old-script literary language of Dagestan and Caucasus. During the 20th century the writing system of the language was changed twice: during Soviet times in 1929 traditional [[Arabic script]] (called [[ajam]]) was substituted by the [[Latin script]] at first, and then in 1938 — by [[Cyrillic script]].

The closest to Kumyk languages are [[Karachay-Balkar language|Karachay-Balkar]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], and [[Karaim language|Karaim]].&lt;ref&gt;Кумыкский энциклопедический словарь. Махачкала. 2012. С. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 90% of Kumyks, according to census, also speak Russian, and those in Turkey speak Turkish.

== Figures and press ==
[[Irchi Kazak]] (''Yırçı Qazaq''; born 1839) is usually considered to be the greatest poet of the Kumyk literature.

The first regular newspapers and magazines appeared in 1917–18 under the editorship of Kumyk poet, writer, translator, theatre figure Temirbolat Biybolatov (Temirbolat Biybolat).

Currently, the newspaper ''Ёлдаш'' (''[[Yoldash]]'', "Companion"), the successor of the Soviet-era ''Ленин ёлу'' (''Lenin yolu'', "Lenin's Path"), prints around 5,000 copies 3 times a week.

{{Contains Khmer text}}

'''Kuy''', also known as '''Kui'''  or '''Kuay''' ({{lang-th|ภาษากูย}}; {{lang-km|ភាសាកួយ}}), is a [[Katuic languages|Katuic language]], part of the larger  [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic family]] spoken by the [[Kuy people]] of Southeast Asia.

Kuy is one of the [[Katuic languages]] within the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic family]]. It is spoken in [[Isan]], Thailand by about 300,000 people, in [[Salavan Province|Salavan]], [[Savannakhet Province|Savannakhet]] and [[Sekong Province]]s of Laos by about 64,000; and in [[Preah Vihear Province|Preah Vihear]], [[Stung Treng Province|Stung Treng]] and [[Kampong Thom Province]]s of northern Cambodia by 15,500 people.

==Names==
Spelling variants and varieties include the following (Sidwell 2005:11).
*Kui
*Kuy
*Kuay
*Koay
*Souei. The term "Souei" is also applied to other groups, such as a [[Pearic languages|Pearic]] community in [[Cambodia]].
*Soai
*Yeu
*Nanhang
*Kouy. A textbook in French is published for this variant ([http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=fr&amp;to=en&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.editions-harmattan.fr%2Findex.asp%3Fnavig%3Dcatalogue%26obj%3Dlivre%26no%3D20692 Parlons Kouy]).

==Dialects==
Van der haak &amp; Woykos (1987-1988) identified two major Kui varieties in Surin and Sisaket provinces of eastern Thailand, '''Kuuy''' and '''Kuay'''. Van der haak &amp; Woykos also identified the following ''divergent'' Kui varieties in [[Sisaket Province]], Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Van der haak, F. and Woykos, B. (1987-1988). "Kui dialect survey in Surin and Sisaket", in ''The Mon-Khmer Studies Journal'', vol. 16-17, pp. 109–142. http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/vanderhaak1987-1988kui.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Kui Nhə''': [[Mueang Sisaket District|Sisaket District]] (10 villages), [[Phrai Bueng District|Phraibung District]] (5 villages), [[Rasi Salai District|Rasisalai District]] (4 villages). About 8,000 people.
*'''Kui Nthaw''' ('''Kui M'ai'''): [[Rasi Salai District|Rasisalai District]] (5 villages), [[Uthumphon Phisai District|Uthumphornphisai District]] (9 villages). All villages mixed with Lao/Isaan.
*'''Kui Preu Yai''': Prue Yai Subdistrict, [[Khukhan District]]. Possibly a late migration from the Mlu Prei area of Cambodia.

Mann &amp; Markowski (2005) reported the following four Kuy dialects spoken in north-central [[Provinces of Cambodia|Cambodia]].
*'''Ntua'''
*'''Ntra''': includes the subdialects of '''Auk''' and '''Wa'''
*'''Mla''': 567 speakers in the single village of Krala Peas, [[Choam Khsant District|Choam Ksan District]], [[Preah Vihear Province]]
*"'''Thmei'''"

A variety of Kui/Kuy called '''Nyeu''' (''ɲə'') is spoken in the villages of Ban Phon Kho, Ban Khamin, Ban Nonkat, Ban Phon Palat, and Ban Prasat Nyeu in [[Sisaket Province]], Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Taweeporn Suwannaraj. 1980. [http://www.sealang.net/archives/mahidol/Taweeporn.pdf ''The phonology of the Nyeu language'']. MA thesis, Mahidol University.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nyeu of Ban Phon Kho claim that their ancestors had migrated from Muang Khong, [[Rasi Salai District|Amphoe Rasisalai]], Sisaket Province.

A '''language isolate''', in the absolute sense, is a [[natural language]] with no demonstrable genealogical (or "genetic") relationship with other languages, one that has not been demonstrated to descend from an ancestor common with any other language. Language isolates are in effect [[language family|language families]] consisting of a single language. Commonly cited examples include [[Ainu language|Ainu]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], and [[Elamite language|Elamite]], though in each case a minority of linguists claim to have demonstrated a relationship with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|date=2010-08-24|title=Language Isolates and Their History, or, What’s Weird, Anyway?|url=http://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/BLS/article/view/3900|journal=Annual Meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=16–31|doi=10.3765/bls.v36i1.3900|issn=2377-1666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources use the term "language isolate" to indicate a branch of a larger family with only one surviving member. For instance, [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] are commonly called Indo-European isolates. While part of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]], they do not belong to any established branch (such as the [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] or [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] branches), but instead form independent branches. Similarly, within the Romance languages, [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] is a relative isolate. However, without a qualifier, ''isolate'' is understood to be in the absolute sense of having no demonstrable genetic relationship to any other known language.

Some languages once seen as isolates may be reclassified as small families. This happened with [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (now included in the [[Japonic languages|Japonic family]] along with [[Ryukyuan languages]] such as [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]]) and [[Georgian language|Georgian]] (now the most dominant or standard of the [[Kartvelian languages]] of the [[Caucasus]]). The [[Etruscan language]] of Italy has long been considered an isolate, but some have proposed that it is related to the so-called [[Tyrsenian languages]], an extinct family of closely related ancient languages proposed by [[Helmut Rix]] (1998), including the [[Rhaetian language|Rhaetian]], formerly spoken in the central [[Alps]], and the [[Lemnian language]], formerly spoken on the Greek island of [[Lemnos]].  The Japonic and Kartvelian families are widely accepted by linguists, but since the ancient family that includes Etruscan has not received a similar level of acceptance,{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} Etruscan is still included in the list of language isolates.

Language isolates may be seen as a special case of [[unclassified language]]s that remain unclassified even after extensive efforts. If such efforts eventually do prove fruitful, a language previously considered an isolate may no longer be considered one, as happened with the [[Yanyuwa language]] of northern [[Australia]], which has been placed in the [[Pama–Nyungan languages|Pama–Nyungan]] family. Since linguists do not always agree on whether a genetic relationship has been demonstrated, it is often disputed whether a language is an isolate or not.

=="Genetic" or "genealogical" relationships==

The term "genetic relationship" is meant in the genealogical sense of [[historical linguistics]], which groups most languages spoken in the world today into a relatively small number of [[language family|families]], according to reconstructed descent from common ancestral languages. A "genetic relationship" is a connection between languages, like similarities in vocabulary or grammar, that can be attributed to a common ancestral proto-language that diverged into multiple languages or branches. For example, [[English language|English]] is related to other [[Indo-European languages]] and [[Mandarin Chinese]] is related to other [[Sino-Tibetan languages]]. By this criterion, each language isolate constitutes a family of its own, which explains the exceptional interest that these languages have received from linguists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16525266|title=Language contact, creolization, and genetic linguistics|last=Grey.|first=Thomason, Sarah|others=Kaufman, Terrence, 1937-|isbn=0520078934|location=Berkeley|oclc=16525266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Looking for relationships==
It is possible that all [[oral language|natural language]]s spoken in the world today are related by direct or indirect descent from a single ancestral tongue.  The established language families would then be only the upper branches of the genealogical tree of all languages, or, equally, lower progeny of a parent tongue. For this reason, language isolates have been the object of numerous studies seeking to uncover their genealogy. For instance, [[Basque language|Basque]] has been compared with every living and extinct Eurasian language family known, from [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] to [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]], without conclusive results.

There are some situations in which a language with no ancestor might arise. This frequently happens with [[sign language]]s, most famously in the case of [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], where deaf children with no language were placed together and developed a new language. Similarly, if deaf parents were to raise a group of hearing children who have no contact with others until adulthood, they might develop an oral [[Idioglossia|language among themselves]] and keep using it later, teaching it to their children, and so on. Eventually, it could develop into the full-fledged language of a population. With unsigned languages, this is not very likely to occur at any one time but, over the tens of thousands of years of human prehistory, the likelihood of this occurring at least a few times increases. There are also [[creole language]]s and [[constructed language]]s such as [[Esperanto]], which do not descend directly from a single ancestor but have become the language of a population; however, they do take elements from existing languages.

==Extinct isolates==
Caution is required when speaking of [[extinct language]]s as isolates. Despite their great age, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Elamite language|Elamite]] can be safely classified as isolates, as the languages are well enough known that, if modern relatives existed, they would be recognizably related {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

However, many extinct languages are very poorly attested, and the fact that they cannot be linked to other languages may be a reflection of our poor knowledge of them. [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], for example, is sometimes claimed to be Indo-European. Although most historical linguists believe this is unlikely, it is not yet possible to resolve the issue. [[Hattic language|Hattic]], [[Gutian language|Gutian]],&lt;ref&gt;Jump up  ^ Mallory, J.P.; Mair, Victor H. (2000). The Tarim Mummies. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. pp. 281–282. {{ISBN|978-0-500-05101-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], [[Mannean language|Mannean]] and [[Kassite language|Kassite]] are also believed to be isolates by mainstream majority, but their status is disputed by a minority of linguists. Similar situations pertain to many extinct isolates of the [[Americas]] such as [[Beothuk language|Beothuk]] and [[Cayuse language|Cayuse]]. A language thought to be an isolate may turn out to be relatable to other languages once enough material is recovered, but material is unlikely to be recovered if a language was not documented in writing.

==Sign language isolates==
{{further|Deaf-community sign language|Village sign language}}

A number of [[sign language]]s have arisen independently, without any ancestral language, and thus are true language isolates. The most famous of these is the [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], a well documented case of what has happened in schools for the deaf in many countries. In Tanzania, for example, there are seven schools for the deaf, each with its own [[Tanzanian sign languages|sign language]] with no known connection to any other language.&lt;ref&gt;''Tanzanian Sign Language (TSL) Dictionary.'' H.R.T. Muzale, University of Dar es Salaam, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Sign languages have also developed outside schools, in communities with high incidences of deafness, such as [[Kata Kolok]] in Bali, the [[Adamorobe Sign Language]] in Ghana, the [[Urubu Sign Language]] in Brazil, several [[Mayan sign languages]], and half a dozen sign languages of the hill tribes in Thailand including the [[Ban Khor Sign Language]].

Studies are also being conducted on [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]] (ABSL) in an isolated village in Israel. The language was developed in isolation for over 75 years by both deaf and hearing people within the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language|title=American Sign Language|date=2015-08-18|newspaper=NIDCD|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These and more are all presumed isolates or small local families, because many deaf communities are made up of people whose hearing parents do not use sign language, and have manifestly, as shown by the language itself, not borrowed their sign language from other deaf communities during the recorded history of these languages.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==List of language isolates by continent==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2007}}
Below is a list of known language isolates, arranged by continent, along with notes on possible relations to other languages or language families.

:In the Status column, "Vibrant" means that a language is in full use by the community, and is spoken in all areas of life by people of all generations. "Vulnerable" means that language use is restricted to certain domains, like the home. "Endangered" means that children are no longer learning the language, and it will die without active revitalization. "Moribund" means that a language is still spoken, but only by older people, who may not be full speakers. "Extinct" means a language has no more fluent native speakers. These definitions come from the UNESCO Atlas of World's Endangered languages. Data comes from their Wikipedia pages.

===Africa===
{{further|Languages of Africa#Unclassified languages}}

With few exceptions, all of Africa’s languages have been gathered into four major phyla: [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]], [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]], [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] and [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]].&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2017. African language isolates. In ''Language Isolates'', edited by Lyle Campbell, pp. 176-206. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the genetic unity of some language families, like [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] and [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]], is questionable, and so there may be many more language families and isolates than currently accepted. Data for several African languages, like [[Kwadi language|Kwadi]] and [[Kwisi language|Kwisi]], are not sufficient for classification. In addition, [[Jalaa language|Jalaa]], [[Shabo language|Shabo]], [[Laal language|Laal]], [[Kujargé language|Kujargé]], and a few other languages within [[Nilo-Saharan]] and [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking areas may turn out to be isolates upon further investigation. [[Defaka language|Defaka]] and [[Ega language|Ega]] are highly divergent languages located within [[Niger-Congo]]-speaking areas, and may also possibly be language isolates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/General/Niger-Congo%20an%20alternative%20view.pdf|title=Niger-Congo: an Alternative View|last=Blench|first=Roger|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:Cornell mcclintic.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guthrie McClintic]] and [[Katharine Cornell]] were reported to have a lavender marriage.]] --&gt;
A '''lavender marriage''' is a male-female marriage in which one or both of the partners is [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[Bisexuality|bisexual]]. The more general term is [[mixed-orientation marriage]]. It is a specialized instance of a [[marriage of convenience]], in which the marriage is formed for some reason other than the romantic attachment assumed to be the basis of modern marriages, for legal reasons involving inheritance or immigration, for example.

The partners in a lavender marriage were concealing the fact that the sexual orientation of at least one of them was not primarily [[heterosexual]]. The term lavender marriage dates from the early 20th century and is used almost exclusively to characterize certain marriages of public celebrities in the first half of the 20th century, primarily before World War II. At the time, public attitudes toward homosexuality made it impossible for a person to pursue a public career, notably in the [[Hollywood]] film industry, while acknowledging homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Claude J. Summers, ''The Queer Encyclopedia of Film &amp; Television'' (Cleis Press, 2005), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest uses of the phrase appeared in the British press in 1895, at a time when [[lavender (color)|lavender]] was associated with homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=January 18, 2015| date= August 29, 1995|first=John|last=Lyttle|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-bride-and-groom-wore-lavender-1598474.html | work= The Independent (UK) |title=The bride and groom wore lavender}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
With the inclusion of morality clauses in the contracts of Hollywood actors in the 1920s, some [[closeted]] stars contracted marriages of convenience to protect their public reputations and preserve their careers. A noteworthy exception that demonstrated the precarious position of the public homosexual was that of [[William Haines]], who brought his career to a sudden end at the age of 35. He refused to end his relationship with his male partner, Jimmy Shields, and enter into a marriage at the direction of his studio employer, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/haines_w.html |title=Haines, William "Billy" (1900-1973) |first=Benjamin |last=Trimmier |accessdate=April 28, 2007 |publisher=[[glbtq.com]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418230919/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/haines_w.html |archivedate=April 18, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The marriage of [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]] supposedly disguised her putative bisexuality and has been characterized as lavender for that reason, but it was prompted by the need to protect both their reputations after a ''Photoplay'' magazine article reported they had been living together for years while unmarried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wayne|first1=Jane Ellen|title=The Leading Men of MGM|date=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|page=xv|url=https://books.google.com.br/books/about/The_Leading_Men_of_MGM.html?id=lh2UflQj9xUC&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[number theory]], and especially the study of [[diophantine approximation]], the '''lonely runner conjecture''' is a [[conjecture]] originally due to J. M. Wills in 1967.  Applications of the conjecture are widespread in mathematics; they include [[view obstruction]] problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Formulation==
{{unsolved|mathematics|Is the lonely runner conjecture true for every number of runners?}}
Consider ''k'' runners on a circular track of unit length.  At ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, all runners are at the same position and start to run; the runners' speeds are pairwise distinct.  A runner is said to be ''lonely'' at time ''t'' if they are at a distance of at least 1/''k'' from every other runner at time ''t''.  The lonely runner conjecture states that each runner is lonely at some time.

A convenient reformulation of the conjecture is to assume that the runners have integer speeds,&lt;ref&gt;This reduction is proved, for example, in section 4 of the paper by Bohman, Holzman, Kleitman.&lt;/ref&gt; not all divisible by the same prime; the runner to be lonely has zero speed.  The conjecture then states that for any set ''D'' of ''k'' − 1 positive integers with [[greatest common divisor]] 1,

: &lt;math&gt;\exists t\in \mathbb{R}\quad \forall d\in D\quad \|td\| \geq \frac{1}{k},&lt;/math&gt;

where ||''x''|| denotes the distance of real number ''x'' to the [[Nearest integer function|nearest integer]].

A '''majority government''' is a government formed by a governing [[political party|party]] that has an [[absolute majority]] of seats in the [[legislature]] or [[parliament]] in a [[parliamentary system]]. This is as opposed to a [[minority government]], where the largest party in a legislature only has a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of seats.

A majority government is usually assured of having its legislation passed and rarely, if ever, has to fear being defeated in parliament.  In contrast, a minority government must constantly bargain for support from other parties in order to pass legislation and avoid being defeated on [[motion of no confidence|motions of no confidence]].

The term "majority government" may also be used for a stable coalition of two or more parties to form an absolute majority. One example of such an electoral coalition is in [[Australia]], where the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] and [[National Party of Australia|National]] parties have run as [[Coalition (Australia)|an electoral bloc]] for decades. 

Another example was the 2010-2015 coalition government in the [[United Kingdom]], which was composed of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties. The Conservatives won the most seats of any single party in the 2010 election, but fell short of an absolute majority. However, by combining with the Liberal Democrats a solid majority in the [[House of Commons]] was created. This was the first true coalition government in the UK since [[World War II]].

'''Nasser Zarafshan''' (born 1946) is an  [[Iran]]ian writer, translator, and attorney.  He is most famous internationally for having been arrested while acting as the legal envoy of two of the families of dissident Iranian writers who were assassinated in November 1998 in what came to be known in Iran as the "[[Chain Murders of Iran|Chain Murders]]" or "serial murders" case. The arrest was widely condemned by human rights groups.&lt;ref name="payvand.com"&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/07/mar/1222.html 3/16/07 Iranian Lawyer Nasser Zarafshan Released After Five Years In Prison]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is reported that Zarafshan had been tremendously critical of the shortcomings in the official examination into these killings. In 2002 he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and was released from prison in March 2007.

==Before his arrest==
As a member of the Iranian Writers' Association Kanoon and a notable member of the Iranian Bar Association, Zarafshan's translations and articles have appeared in important periodicals in Iran.

The murdered journalists included [[Majid Sharif]], an editorialist with the monthly [[Iran é Farda]], writer-journalists [[Mohamad Mokhtari]] and [[Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh]], and a couple, [[Dariush Forouhar|Dariush]] and [[Parvaneh Forouhar]], who were freedom of expression activists.

== Case history ==
Zarafshan was arrested by members of the Judicial Organization of Armed Forces (JOAF) in October 2000 after giving a speech in the city of [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] in which he stated that the intelligence services had murdered five Iranian intellectuals in 1998 in [[Tehran]].

He was initially charged with publishing information about the assassinations, imprisoned in December 2000, and was released after a month pending trial. In February 2002, he was tried in a military court behind closed doors with his solicitor present; the presiding judge was a prosecutor with the JOAF. While in detention, Zarafshan's office was reportedly searched, and weapons and alcohol were allegedly found.

He was sentenced on March 19, 2002 to five years' imprisonment (two years for disseminating state secrets, three years for the possession of firearms) and 70 lashes for the possession of alcohol. Zarafshan denies the firearms and alcohol charges and claims these were planted in his office by the authorities.

Zarafshan was awarded the [[PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award]] in 2004, the Kurt Tucholsky Award of the Swedish [[International PEN|PEN]] section in 2006 and the Human Rights Award of the [[German Association of Judges]] in 2007.

== Imprisonment ==
Iranian judicial organizations have so far failed to explain why Zarafshan, a civilian, was brought before the JOAF, the purpose of which is to try members of the armed forces and Revolutionary Guards for violations of the military code. It is reported that the Chair of the Iranian Parliamentary Committee for Human Rights has protested against the use of a military court in these circumstances, branding it "unconstitutional." {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Zarafshan has reportedly appealed to the Supreme Court and is currently awaiting a decision, which, according to information as of October 2002. During his imprisonment, he was not only denied medical care for an urgent kidney disease for a period of time, but also was held in a cell with prisoners of violent crimes. On June 7, 2005, Zarafshan started a hunger strike to protest the absence of medical treatment. After a significant deterioration in his health, he ended his hunger strike and was hospitalized for an operation on his kidney in July 2005.

On March 16, 2007 after serving his sentence, Zarafshan was released from prison and told reporters, "I will now do the same things I did before." &lt;ref name="payvand.com"/&gt;

'''Ona''' (Aona), also known as '''Selk'nam''' (Shelknam), is a language that is spoken by the [[Selk'nam people]] in [[Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego]] in southernmost [[South America]].

Part of the [[Chonan languages]] of [[Patagonia]], Selk'nam is almost extinct, due both to the late 19th-century [[Selk'nam genocide]] by [[Spanish Argentines|European immigrants]], high fatalities due to disease and disruption of traditional society. One source states that the last fluent native speakers died in the 1980s,&lt;ref name=Adelaar&gt;Adelaar, Willem (2010). "South America". In Christopher (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kFVthqmDs_kC ''Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger''], 3rd Edition. UNESCO. pp. 86-94.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|92}} but another claims that two speakers had survived into 2014.&lt;ref name=Berscia&gt;Rojas, Luis (2014). A Heritage Reference Grammar of Selk'nam. Manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Selk'nam people]], also known as the '''Ona'', were an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] who inhabited the northeastern part of the archipelago of [[Tierra del Fuego]] for thousands of years before Europeans arrived. They were nomads known as "foot-people," as they did their hunting on land, rather than being seafarers.

The last full-blooded Selk'nam, [[Ángela Loij]], died in 1974. They were one of the last aboriginal groups in [[South America]] to be reached by Europeans. Their language, believed to be part of the [[Chonan languages|Chonan]] family, is considered extinct as the last speakers died in the 1980s.

== Phonology ==
Based on available data, Selk'nam seems to have had 3 vowels and 23 consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~saphon|title=SAPhon – South American Phonological Inventories|website=linguistics.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selk'nam has three vowels: {{IPA|/a, ɪ, ʊ/}}.

'''Ostyak''' ({{lang-ru|Остя́к}}) is a name formerly used to refer to several [[indigenous peoples of Siberia|indigenous peoples]] and languages in [[Siberia]], [[Russia]]. Both the [[Khanty people]] and the [[Ket people]] were formerly called Ostyaks, whereas the [[Selkup people]] were referred to as Ostyak-Samoyed.

==Khanty==
{{Main |Khanty people |Khanty language}}
The Khanty people, who also call themselves ''Khanti'', ''Khande'', or ''Kantek'' were known to the Russians as ''[[Yugra]]'' in the eleventh century, with the name ''Ostyak'' first appearing in the sixteenth century. The [[Soviet Union]] began using the [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] ''Khant'' or ''Khanty'' during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Khants or Ostyaks |url=http://www.suri.ee/eup/khants.html |work=Endangered Uralic Peoples |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2002}} some 28,000 people identify as Khanty, primarily in [[Tyumen Oblast]], which includes the Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug.&lt;ref name="Census"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Численность коренных малочисленных народов Севера |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220090902/http://www.raipon.org/russian_site/people/people_perepis_2002_rus.htm |archivedate=2006-02-20 |url=http://www.raipon.org/russian_site/people/people_perepis_2002_rus.htm |accessdate=2013-07-24}} {{link language|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khanty language, also known as Hanty, Khant, Xanty, or Ostyak, is a [[Uralic languages|Uralic language]] with about 9,500 native speakers.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Seventeenth edition |last1=Lewis |first1=M. Paul |last2=Simons |first2=Gary |last3=Fennig |first3=Charles |year=2013 |publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ket==
{{Main |Ket people  |Ket language}}
The Kets historically lived near the [[Yenisei River]] in the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]] district of [[Russia]]. The [[Imperial Russia]]ns originally{{when|date=July 2013}} called them ''Ostyak'', and later ''Yenisei Ostyak''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ket and Other Yeniseian Peoples |url=http://pandora.cii.wwu.edu/vajda/ea210/ket.htm |last=Vajda |first=Edward |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than 1,500 people identified themselves as Ket during the 2002 Russian census.&lt;ref name="Census" /&gt;

The Ket language, also known as Imbatski-Ket or Yenisei Ostyak, is a [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian language]]. It is considered [[Endangered language|severely endangered to moribund]].&lt;ref name="Ethnologue" /&gt;

==Selkup==
{{Main |Selkup people |Selkup language}}
The Selkup people were known as Ostyak-Samoyeds until the 1930s. They are descended from both Yeniseian and [[Samoyedic peoples]], and live in the northern parts of the Siberian plain. About 4,000 people identified as Selkup during the 2002 Russian census.&lt;ref name="Census" /&gt;

The Selkup language, also known as Selkups, Chumyl' Khumyt, Shöl Khumyt, Shösh Gulla, Syusugulla, or Ostyak Samoyed, is a Uralic [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic language]] with perhaps two thousand or more native speakers. The northern dialect is taught in some schools.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2885">In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], the '''right quotient''' (or simply '''quotient''') of a [[formal language]] &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; with a formal language &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; is the language consisting of [[string (computer science)|string]]s ''w'' such that ''wx'' is in &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; for some string ''x'' in &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Linz2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linz|first1=Peter|title=An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata|date=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449615529|pages=104-108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsxDiWvVdBcC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=right+quotient+automata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N-C6U4DVIuKrigKztIC4Dw&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=right%20quotient%20automata&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symbols, we write:

:&lt;math&gt;L_1 / L_2 = \{w \ |  \ \exists x ((x \in L_2)  \land (wx \in L_1)) \}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, each string in &lt;math&gt;L_1 / L_2&lt;/math&gt; is the [[prefix (computer science)|prefix]] of a string &lt;math&gt;wx&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;, with the remainder of the word being a string in &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, the '''left quotient''' of &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; is the language consisting of strings ''w'' such that ''xw'' is in &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; for some string ''x'' in &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;. In symbols, we write:

:&lt;math&gt;L_1 \backslash L_2 = \{w \ | \ \exists x ((x \in L_1)  \land (xw \in L_2))\}&lt;/math&gt;

The left quotient can be regarded as the set of postfixes that complete words from &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that the resulting word is in &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
Consider

&lt;math&gt;L_1 = \{ a^n b^n c^n \ \ |\ \ n\ge 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;L_2 = \{ b^i c^j \ \ | \ \ i,j\ge 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, if we insert a divider into the middle of an element of &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;, the part on the right is in &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; only if the divider is placed adjacent to a ''b'' (in which case ''i''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'' and ''j''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'') or adjacent to a ''c'' (in which case ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''j''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n''). The part on the left, therefore, will be either &lt;math&gt;a^n b^{n-i}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a^n b^n c^{n-j}&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;L_1 / L_2&lt;/math&gt; can be written as

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{ a^p b^q c^r \ \ | \ \ p = q \ge r \ \ \lor \ \ p \ge q \land r = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

==Properties==
Some common closure properties of the right quotient include:

* The quotient of a [[regular language]] with any other language is regular.
* The quotient of a [[context free language]] with a regular language is context free.
* The quotient of two context free languages can be any [[recursively enumerable]] language.
* The quotient of two recursively enumerable languages is recursively enumerable.

These closure properties hold for both left and right quotients.

Such codes, for instance Angloromani (Britain), Caló (Spain), or Rommani (Scandinavia) are usually referred to as
Para-Romani varieties."&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences between the various varieties can be as large as, for example, the differences between the Slavic languages.&lt;ref name="hueb"&gt;Hübschmannová, Milena (1993).

==Name==
Speakers of the Romani language usually refer to the language as ''{{lang|rom|řomani čhib}}'' "the Romani language" or ''{{lang|rom|řomanes}}'' "in a Rom way".&lt;ref name="m2005n"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Matras|2005|loc=1.1 Names}}&lt;/ref&gt; This derives from the Romani word ''{{lang|rom|řom}}'', meaning either "a member of the (Romani) group" or "husband".&lt;ref name="m2005n" /&gt; This is also where the term "Roma" derives in English, although some Roma groups refer to themselves using other [[demonym]]s (e.g. 'Kaale', 'Sinti', etc.).&lt;ref name="m2005n" /&gt; The English spelling "Rromani language" (with two initial Rs) may also be found, reflecting a different transcription of the Romani phoneme ''{{lang|rom|ř}}''.&lt;ref name="m2005n" /&gt;

Before the late nineteenth century, English-language texts usually referred to the language as the "Gypsy language". While it is derogatory, in the USA, "gypsy" is still the most-understood term, as "Romani" is not in common use there.&lt;ref name="m2005n" /&gt;

==Classification==
In the 18th century, it was shown by comparative studies that Romani belongs to the Indo-European language family.&lt;ref name="mluvnice"&gt;Šebková, Hana; Žlnayová, Edita (1998). [http://rss.archives.ceu.hu/archive/00001112/01/118.pdf ''Nástin mluvnice slovenské romštiny (pro pedagogické účely)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024041/http://rss.archives.ceu.hu/archive/00001112/01/118.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}. Ústí nad Labem: Pedagogická fakulta Univerzity J. E. Purkyně v Ústí nad Labem: p. 4. {{ISBN|80-7044-205-0}}. "V 18. století bylo na základě komparatistických výzkumů jednoznačně prokázáno, že romština patří do indoevropské jazykové rodiny a že je jazykem novoindickým" ["In the 18th century, it was conclusively proved on the basis of comparative studie that Romani belongs to the Indo-European language family and is a New-Indian language"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1763 Vályi István, a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] pastor from [[Satu Mare]] in [[Transylvania]], was the first to notice the similarity between Romani and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] by comparing the Romani dialect of [[Győr]] with the language (perhaps [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]) spoken by three [[Sri Lanka]]n students he met in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Courthiade, “Appendix Two. Kannauʒ on the Ganges, cradle of the Rromani people”, in Donald Kenrick, ''Gypsies: from the Ganges to the Thames'' (Hatfield: University of Hertfordshire Press, 2004), 105.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the linguist Johann Christian Christoph Rüdiger (1751–1822) whose book ''{{lang|de|Von der Sprache und Herkunft der Zigeuner aus Indien}}'' (1782) proved Romani was descended from [[Sanskrit]]. This prompted the philosopher [[Christian Jakob Kraus]] to collect linguistic evidence by systematically interviewing the Roma in [[Königsberg]] prison. Kraus's findings were never published, but they may have influenced or laid the groundwork for later linguists, especially [[August Pott]] and his pioneering ''{{lang|de|Darstellung die Zigeuner in Europa und Asien}}'' (1844–45). Research into the way the Romani dialects branched out was started in 1872 by the [[Slavic studies|Slavicist]] [[Franc Miklošič]] in a series of essays. However, it was the philologist [[Ralph Lilley Turner|Ralph Turner]]'s 1927 article “The Position of Romani in Indo-Aryan” that served as the basis for the integrating Romani into the history of Indian languages.

Romani is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] that is part of the [[Balkan sprachbund]]. It is the only [[Indo-Aryan languages#New Indo-Aryan|New Indo-Aryan]] spoken exclusively outside the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name = "intro"&gt;Schrammel, Barbara; Halwachs, Dieter W. (2005). "Introduction". ''General and Applied Romani Linguistics - Proceeding from the 6th International Conference on Romani Linguistics'' (München: LINCOM): p. 1. {{ISBN|3-89586-741-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romani is sometimes classified in the [[Central Zone (Hindi)|Central Zone]] or [[Indo-Aryan languages#Northwestern Zone|Northwestern Zone]] Indo-Aryan languages, and sometimes treated as a group of its own.

Romani shares a number of features with the Central Zone languages.&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt; The most significant [[isogloss]]es are the shift of Old Indo-Aryan ''r̥'' to ''u'' or ''i'' ([[Sanskrit]] ''{{lang|sa|śr̥ṇ-}}'', Romani ''{{lang|rom|šun-}}'' 'to hear') and ''kṣ-'' to ''kh'' (Sanskrit ''{{lang|sa|akṣi}}'', Romani ''{{lang|rom|j-akh}}'' 'eye').&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt; However, unlike other Central Zone languages, Romani preserves many dental clusters (Romani ''{{lang|rom|trin}}'' 'three', ''{{lang|rom|phral}}'' 'brother', compare Hindi ''{{lang|hi-Latn|tīn}}'', ''{{lang|hi-Latn|bhāi}}'').&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt; This implies that Romani split from the Central Zone languages before the [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indo-Aryan period]].&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt; However, Romani shows some features of New Indo-Aryan, such as erosion of the original nominal case system towards a nominative/oblique dichotomy, with new grammaticalized case suffixes added on.&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt; This means that the Romani exodus from India could not have happened until late in the first millennium.&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt;

Many words are similar to the [[Marwari language|Marwari]] and [[Lambadi]] languages spoken in large parts of India. However, Romani is nearer to the Marwari spoken in Rajasthan, India.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www2.arnes.si/~eusmith/Romany/glossary.html |title=Romany–English Glossary |author= |date= |work=arnes.si |accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Romani also shows some similarity to the Northwestern Zone languages.&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt; In particular, the grammaticalization of enclitic pronouns as person markers on verbs (''{{lang|rom|kerdo}}'' 'done' + ''{{lang|rom|me}}'' 'me' → ''{{lang|rom|kerdjom}}'' 'I did') is also found in languages such as [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] and [[Shina language|Shina]].&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt; This evidences a northwest migration during the split from the Central Zone languages consistent with a later migration to Europe.&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt;

Based on these data, Matras (2006) views Romani as "kind of Indian hybrid: a central Indic dialect that had undergone partial convergence with northern Indic languages."&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt;

In terms of its grammatical structures, Romani is conservative in maintaining almost intact the Middle Indo-Aryan present-tense person concord markers, and in maintaining consonantal endings for nominal case – both features that have been eroded in most other modern Indo-Aryan languages.&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt;

Romani shows a number of phonetic changes that distinguish it from other Indo-Aryan languages – in particular, the devoicing of voiced aspirates (''bh dh gh'' &gt; ''ph th kh''), shift of medial ''t d'' to ''l'', of short ''a'' to ''e'', initial ''kh'' to ''x'', rhoticization of retroflex ''ḍ, ṭ, ḍḍ, ṭṭ, ḍh'' etc. to ''r'' and ''ř'', and shift of inflectional ''-a'' to ''-o''.&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt;

After leaving the Indian subcontinent, Romani was heavily affected by contact with European languages.&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt; The most significant of these was [[Medieval Greek]], which contributed lexically, phonemically, and grammatically to Early Romani (10th–13th centuries).&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt; This includes inflectional affixes for nouns, and verbs that are still productive with borrowed vocabulary, the shift to [[VO language|VO word order]], and the adoption of a preposed definite article.&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt; Early Romani also borrowed from [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt;

Romani and [[Domari language|Domari]] share some similarities: agglutination of postpositions of the second layer (or case marking clitics) to the nominal stem, concord markers for the past tense, the neutralisation of gender marking in the plural, and the use of the oblique case as an accusative.&lt;ref name="mat2002_domari"&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Matras-2002 | reference= Matras, Yaron (2002). ''Romani: A Linguistic Introduction'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-02330-0}}| page=48| quote=Striking nonetheless are the grammatical similarities between Romani and Domari: the synthetisation of Layer ii affixes, the emergence of new concord markers for the past tense, the neutralisation of gender marking in the plural, and the use of the oblique case as an accusative.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Matras |first=Yaron |year=2006 |title=Domari |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Languages and Linguistics |edition=Second |editor=Keith Brown |location=Oxford |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/downloads/2/Matras_Domari_ELL2.pdf |quote=The morphology of the two languages is similar in other respects: Both retain the old present conjugation in the verb (Domari kar-ami ‘I do’), and consonantal endings of the oblique nominal case (Domari ''{{lang|rmt|mans-as}}'' ‘man.OBL’, ''{{lang|rmt|mans-an}}'' ‘men.OBL’), and both show agglutination of secondary (Layer II) case endings (Domari ''{{lang|rmt|mans-as-ka}}'' ‘for the man’). It had therefore been assumed that Romani and Domari derived form the same ancestor idiom, and split only after leaving the Indian subcontinent. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has prompted much discussion about the relationships between these two languages. Domari was once thought to be the "sister language" of Romani, the two languages having split after the departure from the Indian subcontinent, but more recent research suggests that the differences between them are significant enough to treat them as two separate languages within the Central Zone ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]) group of languages. The Dom and the Rom therefore likely descend from two different migration waves out of India, separated by several centuries.&lt;ref name="What_is_Domari"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Domari? |publisher=University of Manchester| url = http://romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/files/21_domari.shtml |accessdate=2008-07-23 |postscript=. &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==History==
[[File:Migration des Roms.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Map showing the migrations of Romani people through Europe and Asia minor.]]
The first attestation of Romani is from 1542 AD in western Europe.&lt;ref name="m_h" /&gt; The earlier history of the Romani language is completely undocumented, and is understood primarily through comparative linguistic evidence.&lt;ref name="m_h"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Matras|2006|loc=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic evaluation carried out in the nineteenth century by Pott (1845) and Miklosich (1882–1888) showed the Romani language to be a New Indo-Aryan language (NIA), not a [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indo-Aryan]] (MIA), establishing that the ancestors of the Romani could not have left India significantly earlier than AD 1000.

The principal argument favouring a migration during or after the transition period to NIA is the loss of the old system of nominal case, and its reduction to just a two-way case system, nominative vs. oblique. A secondary argument concerns the system of gender differentiation. Romani has only two [[grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine and feminine). Middle Indo-Aryan languages (named MIA) generally had three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), and some modern Indo-Aryan languages retain this old system even today.

It is argued that loss of the neuter gender did not occur until the transition to NIA. Most of the neuter nouns became masculine while a few feminine, like the neuter {{lang|pra|अग्नि}} (''{{lang|pra-Latn|agni}}'') in the [[Prakrit]] became the feminine {{lang|hi|आग}} (''{{lang|hi-Latn|āg}}'') in [[Hindi]] and ''{{lang|rom|jag}}'' in Romani. The parallels in grammatical gender evolution between Romani and other NIA languages have been cited as evidence that the forerunner of Romani remained on the Indian subcontinent until a later period, perhaps even as late as the tenth century.

There is no historical proof to clarify who the ancestors of the Romani were or what motivated them to emigrate from the [[Indian subcontinent]], but there are various theories. The influence of [[Greek language|Greek]], and to a lesser extent of the [[Iranian languages]] (like [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]) and [[Armenian language|Armenian]], points to a prolonged stay in [[Anatolia]] after the departure from South Asia.

The [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] beginning in the first half of the thirteenth century triggered another westward migration. The Romani arrived in [[Europe]] and afterwards spread to the other continents. The great distances between the scattered Romani groups led to the development of local community distinctions. The differing local influences have greatly affected the modern language, splitting it into a number of different (originally exclusively regional) dialects.

Today Romani is spoken by small groups in 42 European countries.&lt;ref name="ema"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gypsy, Roma and Traveller Achievement |publisher=Ethnic Minority Achievement |url=http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/ethnicminorities/raising_achievement/gypsy_travellerachievement/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608120021/http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/ethnicminorities/raising_achievement/gypsy_travellerachievement/ |archivedate=2009-06-08 |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A project at [[Manchester University]] in England is transcribing Romani dialects, many of which are on the brink of extinction, for the first time.&lt;ref name="ema" /&gt;

==Dialects==
[[File:Romany dialects Europe.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Dialects of the Romani language]]
Today's dialects of Romani are differentiated by the vocabulary accumulated since their departure from [[Anatolia]], as well as through [[sound change|divergent phonemic evolution]] and grammatical features. Many Roma no longer speak the language or speak various new [[contact language]]s from the local language with the addition of Romani vocabulary.

Dialect differentiation began with the dispersal of the Romani from the Balkans around the 14th century and on, and with their settlement in areas across Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="m_dd"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Matras|2006|loc=Dialect diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most significant areas of divergence are the southeast (with epicenter of the northern Balkans) and west-central Europe (with epicenter Germany).&lt;ref name="m_dd" /&gt; The central dialects replace ''{{lang|rom|s}}'' in grammatical paradigms with ''{{lang|rom|h}}''.&lt;ref name="m_dd" /&gt; The west-northern dialects append ''{{lang|rom|j-}}'', simplify ''{{lang|rom|ndř}}'' to ''{{lang|rom|r}}'', retain ''{{lang|rom|n}}'' in the nominalizer ''{{lang|rom|-ipen}}'' / ''{{lang|rom|-iben}}'', and lose adjectival past-tense in intransitives (''{{lang|rom|gelo}}'', ''{{lang|rom|geli}}'' → ''{{lang|rom|geljas}}'' 'he/she went').&lt;ref name="m_dd" /&gt; Other isoglosses (esp. demonstratives, 2/3pl perfective concord markers, loan verb markers) motivate the division into Balkan, Vlax, Central, Northeast, and Northwest dialects.&lt;ref name="m_dd" /&gt;

A long-standing common categorisation was a division between the ''Vlax'' (from ''[[Vlach]]'') and ''non-Vlax'' dialects. ''Vlax'' are those Roma people who lived many centuries in the territory of Romania in [[Slavery in Romania|slavery]]. The main distinction between the two groups is the degree to which their vocabulary is borrowed from [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. Bernard Gilliath-Smith first made this distinction, and coined the term ''Vlax'' in 1915 in the book ''The Report on the Gypsy tribes of North East Bulgaria''. The Vlax dialect group, now seen as just one of about ten groups (see below), has nevertheless become very widespread geographically.

Matras (2002, 2005) has argued for a theory of geographical classification of Romani dialects, which is based on the diffusion in space of innovations. According to this theory, Early Romani (as spoken in the Byzantine Empire) was brought to western and other parts of Europe through population migrations of Rom in the 14th–15th centuries.

These groups settled in the various European regions during the 16th and 17th centuries, acquiring fluency in a variety of contact languages. Changes emerged then, which spread in wave-like patterns, creating the dialect differences attested today. According to Matras, there were two major centres of innovations: some changes emerged in western Europe (Germany and vicinity), spreading eastwards; other emerged in the Wallachian area, spreading to the west and south. In addition, many regional and local isoglosses formed, creating a complex wave of language boundaries. Matras points to the prothesis of ''{{lang|rom|j-}}'' in ''{{lang|rom|aro}}'' &gt; ''{{lang|rom|jaro}}'' 'egg' and ''{{lang|rom|ov}}'' &gt; ''{{lang|rom|jov}}'' 'he' as typical examples of west-to-east diffusion, and of addition of prothetic ''{{lang|rom|a-}}'' in ''{{lang|rom|bijav}}'' &gt; ''{{lang|rom|abijav}}'' as a typical east-to-west spread. His conclusion is that dialect differences formed in situ, and not as a result of different waves of migration.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Boretzky: Kommentierter Dialektatlas des Romani. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2004 p. 18–26&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this classification, the dialects are split as follows:
* [[Northern Romani dialects]] in western and northern Europe, southern Italy and the Iberian peninsula&lt;ref name="matras_proceedings"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matras |first1=Yason |year=2005 |title=The classification of Romani dialects: A geographic-historical perspective |journal=General and Applied Romani Linguistics - Proceeding from the 6th International Conference on Romani Linguistics |pages= |publisher=LINCOM  |url=http://languagecontact.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/YM/downloads/Matras,%20Y.%20(2005)%20The%20classification%20of%20Romani%20dialects.pdf |editor1-first=Barbara |editor1-last=Schrammel |editor2-first=Dieter W. |editor2-last=Halwachs |editor3-first=Gerd |editor3-last=Ambrosch |accessdate=14 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles (beginning from 1982), Marcel Courthiade proposed a different kind of classification. He concentrates on the dialectal diversity of Romani in three successive strata of expansion, using the criteria of phonological and grammatical changes. Finding the common linguistic features of the dialects, he presents the historical evolution from the first stratum (the dialects closest to the Anatolian Romani of the 13th century) to the second and third strata. He also names as "pogadialects" (after the ''{{lang|rom|[[Pogadi]]}}'' dialect of [[Great Britain]]) those with only a Romani vocabulary grafted into a non-Romani language (normally referred to as [[Para-Romani]]).

A table of some dialectal differences:
{| class="wikitable"

The first stratum includes the oldest dialects: ''{{lang|rom|Mećkari}}'' (of [[Tirana]]), ''{{lang|rom|Kabuʒi}}'' (of [[Korça]]), ''{{lang|rom|Xanduri}}'', ''{{lang|rom|Drindari}}'', ''{{lang|rom|Erli}}'', ''{{lang|rom|Arli}}'', ''{{lang|rom|Bugurji}}'', ''{{lang|rom|Mahaʒeri}}'' (of [[Pristina]]), ''{{lang|rom|Ursari}}'' (''{{lang|rom|Rićhinari}}''), ''{{lang|rom|Spoitori}}'' (''{{lang|rom|[[Xoraxane]]}}''), ''{{lang|rom|Karpatichi}}'', ''{{lang|pl|Polska Roma}}'', ''{{lang|fi|Kaale}}'' (from [[Finland]]), ''{{lang|rom|Sinto-manush}}'', and the so-called ''[[Baltic countries|Baltic]] dialects''.

In the second there are ''{{lang|rom|Ćergari}}'' (of [[Podgorica]]), ''{{lang|rom|Gurbeti}}'', ''{{lang|rom|Jambashi}}'', ''{{lang|rom|Fichiri}}'', ''{{lang|rom|Filipiʒi}}'' (of [[Agia Varvara]])

The third comprises the rest of the so-called Gypsy dialects, including ''{{lang|rom|Kalderash}}'', ''{{lang|rom|Lovari}}'', ''{{lang|rom|Machvano}}''.

===Mixed languages===
{{Main|Para-Romani}}
Some Romanies have developed [[mixed language]]s (chiefly by retaining Romani [[lexical item]]s and adopting second language grammatical structures), including:
* in [[Northern Europe]]
** [[Angloromani language|Angloromani]] (in [[British Isles]])
** [[Scottish Cant]] (in [[Scotland]])
** [[Scandoromani language|Scandoromani]] (in [[Scandinavia]])
* on the [[Iberian Peninsula]]:
** [[Erromintxela language|Erromintxela]] (in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]])
** [[Caló language|Caló]] (in [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]).
* in [[Southeast Europe]]
** [[Romano-Greek language|Romano-Greek]]

==Geographic distribution==
Romani is the only Indo-Aryan language spoken almost exclusively in Europe (apart from emigrant populations).&lt;ref name="m_d" /&gt;

The most concentrated areas of Romani speakers are found in [[Romania]]. Although there are no reliable figures for the exact number of Romani speakers, it may be the largest minority language of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="m2005_1.2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Matras|2005|loc=1.2 Numbers and distribution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
{{See also|Romani language standardization}}

The language is recognized as a minority language in many countries. At present the only places in the world where Romani is employed as an official language are the Republic of Kosovo (only regionally, not nationally) &lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Kosovo]]: [http://kushtetutakosoves.info/repository/docs/Constitution.of.the.Republic.of.Kosovo.pdf] (PDF; 244&amp;nbsp;kB), page 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Šuto Orizari Municipality]] within the administrative borders of the Macedonian capital of Skopje.

The first efforts to publish in Romani were undertaken in the interwar [[Soviet Union]] (using the [[Cyrillic script]]) and in communist [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamusella, T. Language in Central Europe's History and Politics: From the Rule of cuius regio, eius religio to the National Principle of cuius regio, eius lingua? ''Journal of Globalization Studies''. Volume 2, Number 1, May 2011 [http://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/140661/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some traditional communities have expressed opposition to codifying Romani or having it used in public functions.&lt;ref name="m_d" /&gt; However, the mainstream trend has been towards standardization.&lt;ref name="m_d" /&gt;

Different variants of the language are now in the process of being codified in those countries with high Romani populations (for example, [[Slovakia]]). There are also some attempts currently aimed at the creation of a [[Romani language standardization|unified standard language]].

A standardized form of Romani is used in Serbia, and in Serbia's autonomous province of Vojvodina, Romani is one of the officially recognized languages of minorities having its own radio stations and news broadcasts.

In Romania, a country with a sizable [[Romani people in Romania|Romani minority]] (3.3% of the total population), there is a unified teaching system of the Romani language for all dialects spoken in the country. This is primarily a result of the work of [[Gheorghe Sarău]], who made Romani textbooks for teaching Romani children in the Romani language. He teaches a purified, mildly [[prescriptive]] language, choosing the original Indo-Aryan words and grammatical elements from various dialects. The pronunciation is mostly like that of the dialects from the first stratum. When there are more variants in the dialects, the variant that most closely resembles the oldest forms is chosen, like ''{{lang|rom|byav}}'', instead of ''{{lang|rom|abyav}}'', ''{{lang|rom|abyau}}'', ''{{lang|rom|akana}}'' instead of ''{{lang|rom|akanak}}'', ''{{lang|rom|shunav}}'' instead of ''{{lang|rom|ashunav}}'' or ''{{lang|rom|ashunau}}'', etc.

An effort is also made to derive new words from the vocabulary already in use, ''i.e.'', ''{{lang|rom|xuryavno}}'' (airplane), ''{{lang|rom|vortorin}}'' (slide rule), ''{{lang|rom|palpaledikhipnasko}}'' (retrospectively), ''{{lang|rom|pashnavni}}'' (adjective). There is an ever-changing set of borrowings from [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as well, including such terms as ''{{lang|rom|vremea}}'' (weather, time), ''{{lang|rom|primariya}}'' (town hall), ''{{lang|rom|frishka}}'' (cream), ''{{lang|rom|sfïnto}}'' (saint, holy). [[Hindi]]-based [[neologism]]s include ''{{lang|rom|bijli}}'' (bulb, electricity), ''{{lang|rom|misal}}'' (example), ''{{lang|rom|chitro}}'' (drawing, design), ''{{lang|rom|lekhipen}}'' (writing), while there are also [[English language|English]]-based neologisms, like ''{{lang|rom|printisarel}}'' &lt; "to print".

Romani is now used on the internet, in some local media, and in some countries as a medium of instruction.&lt;ref name="m_d" /&gt;

==Orthography==
{{Main|Romani alphabets}}
Historically, Romani was an exclusively unwritten language;&lt;ref name="m_d"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Matras|2006|loc=Definitions}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, Slovakian Romani's orthography was codified only in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Šebková, Hana; Žlnayová, Edita (1998). [http://rss.archives.ceu.hu/archive/00001112/01/118.pdf ''Nástin mluvnice slovenské romštiny (pro pedagogické účely)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024041/http://rss.archives.ceu.hu/archive/00001112/01/118.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}. Ústí nad Labem: Pedagogická fakulta Univerzity J. E. Purkyně v Ústí nad Labem: p. 4. {{ISBN|80-7044-205-0}}. "U nás k tomu došlo v roce 1971, kdy jazyková komise při tehdy existujícím Svazu Cikánů-Romů (1969–1973) přijala závaznou písemnou normu slovenského dialektu romštiny."&lt;/ref&gt;

The overwhelming majority of academic and non-academic literature produced currently in Romani is written using a Latin-based orthography.&lt;ref name="mat2002"&gt;{{Wikicite |id=Matras-2002 |reference=Matras, Yaron (2002). ''Romani: A Linguistic Introduction'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-02330-0}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!---There are two statements written that are directly against each other. I am not sure how to combine them correctly.---&gt;
The proposals to form a unified Romani alphabet and one standard Romani language by either choosing one dialect as a standard, or by merging more dialects together, have not been successful - instead, the trend is towards a model where each dialect has its own writing system.&lt;ref name="errc"&gt;
Matras, Yaron. [http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2165 "The Future of Romani: Toward a Policy of Linguistic Pluralism"]. http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2165.&lt;/ref&gt; Among native speakers, the most common pattern for individual authors to use an orthography based on the writing system of the dominant contact language: thus [[Romanian language|Romanian]] in [[Romania]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] in [[Hungary]] and so on.

To demonstrate the differences, the phrase [romaɲi tʃʰib], which means "Romani language" in all the dialects, can be written as ''{{lang|rom|románi szib}}'', ''{{lang|rom|románi čib}}'', ''{{lang|rom|romani tschib}}'', ''{{lang|rom|románi tschiwi}}'', ''{{lang|rom|romani tšiw}}'', ''{{lang|rom|romeni tšiv}}'', ''{{lang|rom|romanitschub}}'', ''{{lang|rom|rromani čhib}}'', ''{{lang|rom|romani chib}}'', ''{{lang|rom|rhomani chib}}'', ''{{lang|rom|romaji šjib}}''&lt;ref name="mluvnice"/&gt; and so on.

A currently observable trend, however, appears to be the adoption of a loosely English and Czech-oriented orthography, developed spontaneously by native speakers for use online and through email.&lt;ref name="mat2002"/&gt;

==Phonology==
The Romani sound system is not highly unusual among European languages. Its most marked features are a three-way contrast between unvoiced, voiced, and aspirated stops: ''p t k č'', ''b d g dž'', and ''ph th kh čh'',&lt;ref name="m_tss"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Matras|2006|loc=The sound system}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the presence in some dialects of a second rhotic ''ř'', realized as uvular [ʀ], a long trill [r:], or retroflex [ɽ] or [ɻ].&lt;ref name="m_tss" /&gt;

The following is the core sound inventory of Romani. Phonemes in parentheses are only found in some dialects:

Eastern and Southeastern European Romani dialects commonly have palatalized consonants, either distinctive or allophonic.&lt;ref name="m_tss" /&gt; Some dialects add the central vowel {{IPA|ə}} or {{IPA|ɨ}}.&lt;ref name="m_tss" /&gt; Vowel length is often distinctive in Western European Romani dialects.&lt;ref name="m_tss" /&gt; Loans from contact languages often allow other non-native phonemes.&lt;ref name="m_tss" /&gt;

Conservative dialects of Romani have final stress, with the exception of some unstressed affixes (e.g. the vocative ending, the case endings added on to the accusative noun, and the remoteness tense marker).&lt;ref name="m_tss" /&gt; Central and western European dialects often have shifted stress earlier in the word.&lt;ref name="m_tss" /&gt;

At the end of the word, voiced consonants become voiceless and aspirated ones lose aspiration. However, both are kept written as voiced / aspirated one.&lt;ref name="mluvnice"/&gt; Examples:

==Morphology==
===Nominals===
Nominals in Romani are nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals.&lt;ref name="mluvnice"/&gt; Some sources describe articles as nominals.

The indefinite article is often borrowed from the local contact language.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt;

====Types====
General Romani is an unusual language, in having two classes of nominals, based on the historic origin of the word, that have a completely different morphology. The two classes can be called ''inherited'' and ''borrowed'',&lt;ref name="mluvnice"/&gt; but this article uses names from Matras (2006),&lt;ref name="matras2006"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Matras|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''ikeoclitic'' and ''xenoclitic''. The class to which a word belongs is obvious from its ending.

=====Ikeoclitic=====
The first class is the old, Indian vocabulary (and to some extent [[Persian language|Persian]], Armenian and Greek loanwords).&lt;ref name="mluvnice"/&gt; The ikeoclitic class can also be divided into two sub-classes, based on the ending.&lt;ref name="matras2006"/&gt;

=====Nominals ending in o/i=====
The ending of words in this sub-class is -o with masculines, -i with feminines, with the latter ending triggering palatalisation of preceding ''d, t, n, l'' to ''ď, ť, ň, ľ''.&lt;ref name="mluvnice"/&gt;

Examples:&lt;ref name="mluvnice"/&gt;
*masculine
**'''{{lang|rom|o čhavo}}''' - the son
**'''{{lang|rom|o cikno}}''' - the little
**'''{{lang|rom|o amaro}}''' - our (m.)
*feminine
**'''{{lang|rom|e rakľi}}''' - non-romani girl
**'''{{lang|rom|e cikňi}}''' - small (note the change n &gt; ň)
**'''{{lang|rom|e amari}}''' - ours (f.)

=====Nominals without ending=====
All words in this sub-class have no endings, regardless of gender.

Examples:&lt;ref name="hueb1974"&gt;Hübschmannová, Milena (1974). ''Základy Romštiny''&lt;/ref&gt;
*masculine
**'''{{lang|rom|o phral/špal}}''' - the  brother
**'''{{lang|rom|o šukar}}''' - the nice (m.)
**'''{{lang|rom|o dat}}''' - the father
*feminine
**'''{{lang|rom|e phen}}''' - the sister
**'''{{lang|rom|e šukar}}''' - the nice (f.) - same as m.
**'''{{lang|rom|e daj}}''' - the  mother

=====Xenoclitic=====
The second class is loanwords from [[European languages]].&lt;ref name="mluvnice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hueb1974"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matras 2002: p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; (Matras adds that the morphology of the new loanwords might be borrowed from Greek.)

The ending of borrowed masculine is -os, -is, -as, -us, and the borrowed feminine ends in -a.

Examples from Slovakian Romani:&lt;ref name="mluvnice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hueb1974"/&gt;
*masculine
**'''{{lang|rom|o šustros}}''' - shoemaker
**'''{{lang|rom|o autobusis}}''' - bus
**'''{{lang|rom|o učiteľis}}''' - teacher (m.)
*feminine
**'''{{lang|rom|e rokľa/maijka}}''' - skirt
**'''{{lang|rom|e oblaka/vokna }}''' - window
**'''{{lang|rom|e učiteľka}}''' - teacher (f.) (from ''{{lang|sk|učiteľka}}'' in [[Slovak language|Slovak]])

====Basics of morphology====
Romani has two [[grammatical gender]]s (masculine / feminine) and two numbers (singular / plural).&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt;

All nominals can be singular or plural.&lt;ref&gt;Hübschmannová 1974: p.4, V 1.3&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cases====
Nouns are marked for case, the most important being the [[nominative case|nominative]] and the [[accusative case]].&lt;!---The two classes mentioned above have different morphology.---&gt;

The vocative, nominative and indirect case are a bit "outside" of the case system&lt;ref name="seb52"&gt;Šebková, Žlnayová 1998, p. 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; as are produced only by adding a suffix to the root.

Example: the suffix for singular masculine vocative of ikeoclitic types is '''{{lang|rom|-eja}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;Šebková, Žlnayová 1998, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hübschmannová 1974 – p. 31, V2,1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''{{lang|rom|čhaveja!}}''' - you, boy (or son)!
*'''{{lang|rom|cikneja!}}''' - you, little one!
*'''{{lang|rom|phrala!}}''' - brother!

The other five cases are a little different. They are all derived from an "indirect root", that is made a little differently for each type;&lt;ref name="mluvnice"/&gt; the indirect root is the same as the accusative case. To this root, every case adds its own suffix, with disregard to gender or type: ''{{lang|rom|-te}}'' / ''{{lang|rom|-de}}'' (locative and prepositional), ''{{lang|rom|-ke}}'' / ''{{lang|rom|-ge}}'' (dative), ''{{lang|rom|-tar/-dar}}'' (ablative), ''{{lang|rom|-sa(r)}}'' (instrumental and [[comitative]]), and ''{{lang|rom|-ker-}}'' / ''{{lang|rom|-ger-}}'' (genitive).&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt;

Example: The endings for o/i ending nominals are as follows:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
!
! sg. nom.
! sg. acc.
! pl. nom.
! pl. acc.
|-
! 'boy'&lt;br /&gt;(masculine)
| ''{{lang|rom|čhav-o}}''
| ''{{lang|rom|čhav-es}}''
| ''{{lang|rom|čhav-e}}''
| ''{{lang|rom|čhav-en}}''
|-
! 'woman'&lt;br /&gt;(feminine)
| ''{{lang|rom|řomn-i}}''
| ''{{lang|rom|řomn-ja}}''
| ''{{lang|rom|řomn-ja}}''
| ''{{lang|rom|řomn-jen}}''
|}

Example: the suffix for indirect root for masculine plural for all inherited words is ''{{lang|rom|-en}}'',&lt;ref name="seb52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hübschmannová 1974 - p. 43, V4&lt;/ref&gt; the dativ suffix is ''{{lang|rom|-ke}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Šebková, Žlnayová 1998, p. 76–78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hübschmannová 1974 - p. 60, V7.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''{{lang|rom|o kozaro}}''' - mushroom
*'''{{lang|rom|kozaren}}''' - the indirect root (also used as accusative)
*'''{{lang|rom|Ňila phiras kozarenge.}}''' – In the summer we go on mushrooms (meaning picking mushrooms)

There are many [[declension class]]es of nouns that decline differently, and show dialectal variation.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt;

Slovakian Romani also uses these nine cases:&lt;ref&gt;Šebková, Žlnayová 1998, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;
* nominative
* vocative
* accusative
* dative
* locative
* ablative
* instrumental
* genitive
* indirect case

The indirect case is used when a word functions as an attribute before a word,&lt;ref&gt;Šebková, Žlnayová 1998, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; and is not considered a case in some literature.

====Agreement====
Romani shows the typically Indo-Aryan pattern of the genitive agreeing with its head noun.

Example:
* ''{{lang|rom|čhav-es-ker-o phral}}'' - 'the boy's brother'
* ''{{lang|rom|čhav-es-ker-i phen}}''  - 'the boy's sister'.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt;

Adjectives and the definite article show agreement with the noun they modify.

Example:
* ''{{lang|rom|mir-o dad}}'' - 'my father'
* ''{{lang|rom|mir-i daj}}'' - 'my mother'.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt;&lt;ref name="m_s" /&gt;

===Verbs===
Romani derivations are highly synthetic and partly agglutinative. However, they are also sensitive to recent development - for example, in general, Romani in Slavic countries show an adoption of productive [[lexical aspect|aktionsart]] morphology.&lt;ref name="matras117"&gt;Matras 2002 - pg 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the verb is the lexical root, verb morphology is suffixed.&lt;ref name="matras117"/&gt;

The verb stem (including derivation markers) by itself has non-perfective aspect and is present or subjunctive.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt;

====Types====

Similarly to nominals, verbs in Romani belong to several classes, but unlike nominals, these are not based on historical origin. However, the loaned verbs can be recognized, again, by specific endings, which some&lt;ref name="matras117"/&gt; argue are Greek in origin.

=====Irregular verbs=====
Some words are irregular, like ''{{lang|rom|te jel}}'' - to be.

=====Class I=====
The next three classes are recognizable by suffix in 3rd person singular.

The first class, called I.,&lt;ref name="mluvnice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h20"&gt;Hübschmannová 1974 - p. 20, V1.&lt;/ref&gt; has a suffix ''{{lang|rom|-el}}'' in 3rd person singular.

Examples, in 3 ps. sg:&lt;ref name="h20"/&gt;
*''{{lang|rom|te kerel}}'' -to do
*''{{lang|rom|te šunel}}'' - to hear
*''{{lang|rom|te dikhel}}'' - to see

=====Class II=====
Words in the second category, called II.,&lt;ref name="mluvnice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h20"/&gt; have a suffix ''{{lang|rom|-l}}'' in 3rd person singular.

Examples, in 3 ps. sg:&lt;ref name="h20"/&gt;
*''{{lang|rom|te džal}}'' - to go
*''{{lang|rom|te ladžal}}'' - to be ashamed, shy away.
*''{{lang|rom|te asal}}'' - to laugh
*''{{lang|rom|te paťal}}'' - to believe
*''{{lang|rom|te hal}}'' - to eat

=====Class III=====
All the words in the third class are semantically causative passive.&lt;ref&gt;Hübschmannová 1974 - p. 57, V4,1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:&lt;ref&gt;Hübschmannová 1974 - p. 54, S.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''{{lang|rom|te sikhľol}}'' - to learn
*''{{lang|rom|te labol}}'' - to burn
*''{{lang|rom|to marďol}}'' - to be beaten
*''{{lang|rom|te pašľol}}'' - to lie

=====Borrowed verbs=====

Borrowed verbs from other languages are marked with affixes taken from Greek tense/aspect suffixes, including ''{{lang|rom|-iz-}}'', ''{{lang|rom|-in-}}'', and ''{{lang|rom|-is-}}''.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt;

====Morphology====
The Romani verb has three persons and two numbers, singular and plural.  There is no verbal distinction between masculine and feminine.

Romani tenses are, not exclusively, present tense, future tense, two past tenses (perfect and imperfect), present or past conditional and present imperative.

Depending on the dialect, the suffix ''{{lang|rom|-a}}'' marks the present, future, or conditional.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt; There are many perfective suffixes, which are determined by root phonology, valency, and semantics: e.g. ''{{lang|rom|ker-d-}}'' 'did'.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt;

There are two sets of personal conjugation suffixes, one for non-perfective verbs, and another for perfective verbs.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt; The non-perfective personal suffixes, continued from [[Middle Indo-Aryan]], are as follows:&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+ Non-perfective personal suffixes
!
! 1
! 2
! 3
|-
! sg.
| ''{{lang|rom|-av}}''
| ''{{lang|rom|-es}}''
| ''{{lang|rom|-el}}''
|-
! pl.
| ''{{lang|rom|-as}}''
| colspan="2" | ''{{lang|rom|-en}}''
|}

These are slightly different for consonant- and vowel-final roots (e.g. ''{{lang|rom|xa-s}}'' 'you eat', ''{{lang|rom|kam-es}}'' 'you want').&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt;

The perfective suffixes, deriving from late Middle Indo-Aryan [[enclitic]] pronouns, are as follows:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+ Perfective personal suffixes
!
! 1
! 2
! 3
|-
! sg.
| ''{{lang|rom|-om}}''
| ''{{lang|rom|-al}}'' / ''{{lang|rom|-an}}''
| ''{{lang|rom|-as}}''
|-
! pl.
| ''{{lang|rom|-am}}''
| ''{{lang|rom|-an}}'' / ''{{lang|rom|-en}}''
| ''{{lang|rom|-e}}''
|}

Verbs may also take a further remoteness suffix ''{{lang|rom|-as}}'' / ''{{lang|rom|-ahi}}'' / ''{{lang|rom|-ys}}'' / ''{{lang|rom|-s}}''.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt; With non-perfective verbs this marks the imperfect, habitual, or conditional.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt; With the perfective, this marks the [[pluperfect]] or counterfactual.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt;

=====Class I=====

*present imperative - ''{{lang|rom|pašľuv!}}''&lt;ref&gt;Šebková, Žlnayová 1998, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

====Valency====

[[Valency (linguistics)|Valency]] markers are affixed to the verb root either to increase or decrease valency.&lt;ref name="m_m"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Matras|2006|loc=Morphology}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is dialectal variation as to which markers are most used; common valency-increasing markers are ''{{lang|rom|-av-}}'', ''{{lang|rom|-ar-}}'', and ''{{lang|rom|-ker}}'', and common valency-decreasing markers are ''{{lang|rom|-jov-}}'' and ''{{lang|rom|-áv-}}''.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt; These may also be used to derive verbs from nouns and adjectives.&lt;ref name="m_m" /&gt;

==Syntax==
Romani syntax is quite different from most Indo-Aryan languages, and shows more similarity to the [[Balkan languages]].&lt;ref name="m_s"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Matras|2006|loc=Syntax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Šebková and Žlnayová, while describing Slovakian Romani, argues that Romani is a free word order language&lt;ref name="mluvnice"/&gt;  and that it allows for theme-rheme structure, similarly to Czech, and that in some Romani dialects in East Slovakia, there is a tendency to put a verb at the end of a sentence.

However, Matras describes it further.&lt;ref&gt;Matras 2002 - p. 167-168&lt;/ref&gt; According to Matras, in most dialects of Romani, Romani is a [[VO language]], with [[subject-verb-object|SVO]] order in contrastive sentences and [[verb-subject-object]] order in thetic sentences.&lt;ref name="m_s" /&gt; The tendency to put verb on the end in some dialects is the Slavic influence.

Examples, from Slovakian Romani:&lt;ref&gt;Hübschmannová, Milena (1974). ''Základy Romštiny''. Praha: Academia Praha: p. 7, par. 1,1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{lang|rom|Odi kuči šilaľi.}}'' - This cup is cold.
* ''{{lang|rom|Oda šilaľi kuči.}}'' - This is a cold cup.

Clauses are usually [[finite clause|finite]].&lt;ref name="m_s" /&gt; Relative clauses, introduced by the [[relativizer]] ''kaj'', are postponed.&lt;ref name="m_s" /&gt; Factual and non-factual complex clauses are distinguished.&lt;ref name="m_s" /&gt;

==Romani in modern times==
Romani has lent several words to English such as ''pal'' (ultimately from Sanskrit ''{{lang|sa-Latn|bhrātar}}'' "brother"&lt;ref name=OEED&gt;Hoad, TF (ed.) ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Etymology'' (1996) Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-283098-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''nark'' "informant" (from Romani ''{{lang|rom|nāk}}'' "nose"&lt;ref name="OEED"/&gt;). Other Romani words in general slang are ''gadgie'' (originally meaning "person who's not Roma", currently used as a gender-neutral term for boyfriend/girlfriend in Bulgaria), ''shiv'' or ''chiv'' (knife). Urban British slang shows an increasing level of Romani influence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eV9MyzOnBi8C&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=british+slang+romani+influence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWsMyduPHZAhXJj1QKHTzWAOgQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=british+slang+romani+influence&amp;f=true|title=Urban North-Eastern English|first=Joan C.|last=Beal|date=31 March 2012|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some words becoming accepted into the lexicon of standard English (for example, ''[[chav]]'' from an assumed Anglo-Romani word, meaning "small boy", in the majority of dialects). There are efforts to teach and familiarise Vlax-Romani to new generation of Romani so that Romani spoken in different parts of the world are connected through a single dialect of Romani. Indian Institute of Romani Studies, [[Chandigarh]] published several Romani language lessons through its journal ''Roma'' during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Lee-2005 | reference= Lee, Ronald (2005). ''Learn Romani: Das-dúma Rromanes'', Hatfield: University of Hertfordshire Press. {{ISBN|1-902806-44-1}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Occasionally loanwords from other [[Indo-Iranian languages]] such as [[Hindi language|Hindi]] are mistakenly labelled as Romani due to surface similarities (due to a shared root), such as ''cushy'', which is from Hindi (itself a loan from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''{{lang|fa-Latn|khuš}}'') meaning "excellent, healthy, happy".&lt;ref name=OEED/&gt;

'''Rufino José Cuervo Urisarri''' ([[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]), was a Colombian writer, [[linguist]], and [[philologist]].

He studied [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], but the main part of his work was dedicated to the study of the dialectal variations of Spanish spoken in Colombia. About this topic, he wrote his book ''Apuntaciones críticas sobre lenguaje bogotano'' (''Critical Notes About Bogotan Language'', 1867), which is still an important reference in the study of the American Spanish language.

His most important work was ''[[Diccionario de construcción y régimen de la lengua castellana]]'' (''Dictionary of Castilian language construction and rection'').
This work is updated on a regular basis by the [[Caro y Cuervo Institute]]. Cuervo also revised and republished the Spanish American grammar of [[Andrés Bello]], ''[[Castilian Grammar for Americans]]''.
[[Image:RufinoJoséCuervo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Rufino José Cuervo]]
Cuervo was one of the first linguists who promoted the union of the Spanish language in its different variants. He was worried about the segregationist trend in spoken Spanish and thought that this phenomenon was similar to the events following the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], after which [[Latin]] gradually began splitting into several independent [[Romance languages]], such as Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and Italian.

In 1878 he was admitted as the Colombian representative to the [[Real Academia Española]]. In 1882 he moved to Paris, where he lived until his death in 1911.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4667">{{Semiotics}}
[[Semiotics]] is the study of [[meaning-making]] on the basis of signs. Semiotics of [[photography]] is the observation of symbolism used within photography or "reading" the picture. This article refers to realistic, unedited photographs not those that have been manipulated in any way.
[[Roland Barthes]] was one of the first people to study the semiotics of images. He developed a way to understand the meaning of images. Most of Barthes' studies related to advertising, but his concepts can apply to photography as well.&lt;ref name="Borchers 2006 271"&gt;{{cite book|last=Borchers|first=Timothy|title=Rhetorical Theory|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|location=Belmont, California|isbn=0-534-63918-6|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denotation==

[[Denotation]] refers to the meaning hidden in symbols or images. A denotation is "what we see" in the picture or what is "there" in the picture.&lt;ref name="Bate 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bate|first=David|title=Photography: The Key Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Burg|isbn=978-1-84520-667-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], this is another way of saying that a photograph has both a signified and a referent, is both coded and encoded. This is to re-emphasize the co-existence of the iconic and idexical.&lt;ref name=References&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Clive|title=The Spoken Image: Photography and Language|year=1999|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-032-0|pages=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; In photography the photo itself is the signifier, the signified is what the image is or represents.&lt;ref name="Seiter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Seiter|first=Ellen|title=Semiotics, Structuralism, and Television|url=http://www.asu.edu/courses/lia394c/total-readings/Seiter--Semiotics.htm|work=Channels of Discourse, Reassembled: Television and Contemporary Criticism|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literal meaning of the image.

==Connotation==

[[Connotation (Semiotics)]] is arbitrary in that the meanings brought to the image are based on rules or conventions that the reader has learnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=David|title=Visible Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics in the Visual Arts|year=2010|publisher=AVA Publishing|isbn=978-2-940411-42-9|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotation attaches additional meaning to the first signifier, which is why the first signifier is often described in multiple words that include things like camera angle, color, lighting, etc.&lt;ref name="Seiter"/&gt; It is the immediate cultural meaning from what is seen in the picture, but not what is actually there.&lt;ref name="Bate 2009"/&gt; Connotation is what is implied by the image.

==Coded iconic==

According to Roland Barthes the coded iconic message is the story that the image portrays. This message is easily understood and the images represent a clear relationship.&lt;ref name="Borchers 2006 271"/&gt; The "reader" of the image applies their knowledge to the encoding of the photo. An image of a bowl of fruit for example might imply still life, freshness or market stalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=David|title=Visible Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics|year=2003|publisher=AKA Books|isbn=978-2-88479-035-2|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noncoded iconic==

Noncoded iconic is another part of Barthes' theory of understanding images. Noncoded has nothing to do with the emotions from the image as a whole. It is the "literal" denotation, the recognition of identifiable object in the photograph, irrespective of the larger societal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seiler|first=Robert M.|title=Roland Barthes|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~rseiler/barthes.htm|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the bowl of fruit example, this photograph is just that, a bowl of fruit. A non-coded iconic has no deeper meaning, the image is exactly what it shows.

The '''Tuu languages''', or '''Taa–ǃKwi''' ('''Taa–ǃUi''', '''ǃUi–Taa''', '''Kwi''') '''languages''', are a [[language family]] consisting of two language clusters spoken in [[Botswana]] and [[South Africa]]. The relationship between the two clusters is not doubted but is not close. The name ''Tuu'' comes from a word for "person" common to both branches of the family.

== Classification ==

The Tuu languages are not demonstrably related to any other language family, however they do share a great many similarities to the languages of the [[Kx'a languages|Kx'a family]]. This is generally thought to be due to thousands of years of [[Language contact|contact]] and mutual influence (that is, a [[sprachbund]]), but some scholars believe that the two families may eventually prove to be related.  

The Tuu languages were once thought to form a branch of the now-obsolete [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan language family]] and were called '''Southern Khoisan''' in that scenario.

==Languages==
*'''Taa'''
**[[Taa language|ǃXóõ]] (a dialect cluster)
**[[Lower Nossob language|Lower Nossob]] (two dialects, ǀʼAuni and Kuǀhaasi) †
*'''ǃKwi''' (!Ui)
**[[Nǁng language|Nǁng]] (a dialect cluster; moribund)
**[[ǀXam language|ǀXam]] (a dialect cluster, including Nǀuusaa) †
**[[Vaal–Orange language|ǂUngkue]] †
**[[ǁXegwi language|ǁXegwi]] †
**[[ǃGãǃne language|ǃGãǃne]] †

The '''ǃKwi''' (!Ui) branch of South Africa is [[Endangered language|moribund]], with only one language remaining, [[Nǁng language|Nǁng]], and that with less than 5 elderly speakers. ǃKwi languages were once widespread across South Africa; the most famous, [[ǀXam language|ǀXam]], was the source of the modern [[national motto]] of that nation, ''{{IPA|ǃke eː ǀxarra ǁke}}''. 

The '''Taa''' branch of Botswana is more robust, though it also has one surviving language, [[Taa language|ǃXóõ]], with 2,500 speakers. 

Because many of the Tuu languages became extinct with little record, there is considerable confusion as to which of their many names represented separate languages or even dialects. See [[List of Khoisan languages]] for some possibilities.

The Tuu languages, along with neighbouring [[ǂ’Amkoe language|ǂ’Amkoe]], are known for being the only languages in the world to have [[bilabial click]]s as distinctive speech sounds (apart from the extinct ritual jargon [[Damin]] of northern [[Australia]], which was never anyone's mother tongue). Taa, ǂ’Amkoe and neighbouring [[Gǀui language|Gǀui]] (of the Khoe family) form a [[sprachbund]] (language area) with some of the most complex inventories of both [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s in the world. All languages in these three families also have [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].

'''Yurumanguí''' is an extinct language of [[Colombia]]. It is known only through a short list of words and phrases recorded by Father Christoval Romero and given by him to Captain Sebastián Lanchas de Estrada, who included them in the report of his travels of 1768. Thereafter the language and its speakers disappear from the historical record.

Father Romero's word list was discovered in the archives and published, with analysis and commentary, by Rivet (1942), who argued that the language was a member of the [[Hokan languages|Hokan language family]]. This claim is considered poor and unconvincing; a critique is given by Poser (1992). Swadesh (1963) saw connections with [[Opaye language|Opaye]] and [[Chamicura language|Chamicura]] (Maipurean). Adelaar notes similarities with [[Esmeralda language|Esmeralda (Takame)]]. However, it is generally considered unclassifiable due to the paucity of data.

Loukotka (1968) included a number of purported languages from the same region in a Yurimangui stock in his language classification.  These are ''Timba, Lili'' (at Calí), ''Yolo/Paripazo, Jamundi,'' and ''Puscajae/Pile.''  However, he notes that nothing is known of any of them.
