[[Singapore]]'s grading system in schools is differentiated by the existence of many types of institutions with different education foci and systems. The grading systems that are used at Primary, Secondary, and Junior College levels are the most fundamental to the local system used.

==Primary schools==
Primary schools in Singapore implement a grading system along with an "Achievement Band" until the system disregarded the EM3 stream and concentrated on an "Overall Grade" scheme, which grades students as below:

===Primary 1 to 4===
* Band 1: 85-100
* Band 2: 70-84
* Band 3: 50-69
* Band 4 (fail) : 49 and below

===Primary 5 to 6 foundation stream===
* Grade 1: 85% and above
* Grade 2: below 85% to 70%
* Grade 3: below 70% to 50%
* Grade 4: below 50% to 30%
* U: Below 30%

==Secondary schools==
Secondary schools are the first institutions in Singapore to have implemented the “Overall Grade” grading system for academic subjects. Since the 2000s, the education system allows more capable Normal (Academic) stream students to participate in the O Levels examination for Mother Tongue and Mathematics (Elementary) a year instead of taking the N Levels equivalents. This has resulted with a quasi-O Levels grading system used for such students, although their N Levels subjects are graded along the Overall Grade grading system, thus in their result slip, some subjects will be graded along the Overall Grade, and some with the O Levels grading system.

Express and Special stream students are graded along the Overall Grade grading system for the first 3 academic years in their secondary schools, and then graded along the O Levels grading system in their final secondary school year (year 4). Normal (Academic) students are graded for first 3 academic years and the N Levels year (year 4), and subsequently graded along the O Levels grading system in their final secondary school year (year 5). Normal (Technical) stream students are graded along the Overall Grade grading system throughout their entire education in secondary schools.

Non-academic subjects like Religious Knowledge, Character and Citizenship Education and Music are graded with an alphabetical grading system of A, B, C or D.

===Overall grade===
* A1: 75% - 100%
* A2: 70% - 74%
* B3: 65% - 69%
* B4: 60% - 64%
* C5: 55% - 59%
* C6: 50% - 54%
* D7: 45% - 49%
* E8: 40% - 44%
* F9:  0% - 39%

===GPA and MSG===

In some Secondary Schools, the Grade Point Average (GPA) grading system is used. The GPA is usually calculated by taking the Grade Point of each subject, adding them together, then dividing the total by that number of subjects. The actual subjects counted towards the GPA computation differs between schools. For example, Victoria School gives its students the option to exclude applicable subjects from the GPA computation depending on the subject combination of the student. This GPA value is rounded to two decimal places, giving the student's GPA. A minimum GPA of 2.0 will usually be required for promotion. 

For example, the GPA table for [[Raffles Girls' School]] and [[Raffles Institution (Secondary)]]  is as follows:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Grade
! Percentage
! Grade point
|-
| A+
| 80-100
| 4.0
|-
| A
| 70-79
| 3.6
|-
| B+
| 65-69
| 3.2
|-
| B
| 60-64
| 2.8
|-
| C+
| 55-59
| 2.4
|-
| C
| 50-54
| 2.0
|-
| D
| 45-49
| 1.6
|-
| E
| 40-44
| 1.2
|-
| F
| &lt;40
| 0.8
|}

For example, the GPA table for Victoria School (Integrated Programme) is as follows:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Grade
! Percentage
! Grade point
|-
| 4.0
| 75-100
| 4.0
|-
| 4.0
| 70-74
| 4.0
|-
| 3.5
| 65-69
| 3.5
|-
| 3.0
| 60-64
| 3.0
|-
| 2.5
| 55-59
| 2.5
|-
| 2.0
| 50-54
| 2.0
|-
| 1.5
| 45-49
| 1.5
|-
| 1.0
| 40-44
| 1.0
|-
| 0.5
| 35-40
| 0.5
|-
| 0.0
| &lt;40
| 0.0
|}

The GPA table differs from school to school and tracks, with schools like [[Dunman High School]] excluding the grades "C+" and "B+" (meaning grades 50-59 are counted as Cs, and vice versa).

However, in other secondary schools like [[Hwa Chong Institution]], [[St. Joseph’s Institution]], [[School of Science and Technology, Singapore|School of Science and Technology]], and [[Victoria School]] (Express), a similar grading system called the Mean Subject Grade (MSG) is used. The MSG table is as follows:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Grade
! Percentage
! Grade point
|-
| A1
| 75-100
| 1
|-
| A2
| 70-74
| 2
|-
| B3
| 65-69
| 3
|-
| B4
| 60-64
| 4
|-
| C5
| 55-59
| 5
|-
| C6
| 50-54
| 6
|-
| D7
| 45-49
| 7
|-
| E8
| 40-44
| 8
|-
| F9
| &lt;40
| 9
|}

The MSG is calculated by adding the points together and dividing the sum by the number of subjects. For example, if a student scored an A1 for math, B4 for English, and C6 for Chemistry, his MSG would be &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1+4+6}{3}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{11}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

This will be rounded to two decimal places, giving a final MSG of 3.67

===N(A) levels grades===
* A1: 75% and above
* A2: 70% to 74% 
* B3: 65% to 69%
* B4: 60% to 64%
* C5: 50% to 59%
* U: Below 50%, considered Un-graded, or failed. Considered 6 points.

===N(T) levels grades===
* A: 75% and above
* B: 70% to 75%
* C: 60% to 69%
* D: 50% to 59%
* U: Below 50%, considered failed

===O levels grades===
* A1: 75% and above
* A2: 70% to 74%
* B3: 65% to 69%
* B4: 60% to 64%
* C5: 55% to 59%
* C6: 50% to 54%
* D7: 45% to 49%
* E8: 40% to 44%
* F9: Below 40%
* Grades D7, E8 and F9 are considered the ''failing'' grades. Students taking Mother Tongue Syllabus B may be awarded a Merit, a Pass, or an Ungraded grade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seab.gov.sg/aLevel/generalInfo.html Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Junior college level (GCE A and AO levels)==
* A: 70% or Above
* B: 60% to 69%
* C: 55% to 59%
* D: 50% to 54%
* E: 45% to 49% (passing grade)
* S: 40% to 44% (denotes standard is at AO level only), grade N in the British A Levels.
* U: 39% and below

In addition, students offering Special Papers (offered for the last time in 2006) will be awarded either 1 (Distinction), 2 (Merit), or U (Unclassified). Grades 1 and 2 may only be awarded with a grade E and above in the main A level paper.  Grade U will be awarded if a candidate fails to achieve at least a grade E in the main subject paper, and will not be reflected in the A level result certificate.

For students offering H3 Subjects (introduced for the first time in 2006), they will be awarded either Distinction, Merit, Pass or Ungraded.

Different JCs have different expectations and thus, the school reserves the discretion to moderate the marks when deemed necessary. For example, some JCs may regard 50% as the passing mark instead of 45% by others.

Note: AO level grades at Junior College level follows the O level system above.

All percentages with their corresponding grades shown here are just approximate guidelines because ultimately at the end of all major examinations (Primary School Leaving Examinations or PSLE in short, GCE N, O and A Levels) the Ministry of Education, Singapore, will moderate the results. Hence, an A grade for instance may no longer be at 70%. It could possibly be 68% or even 73% depending on the performance of the cohort. This is usually done to prevent [[grade inflation]].

In addition, some schools are also offering the [[International Baccalaureate]] diploma program.

==Polytechnic (diploma)==

Note: Some polytechnics do not have grades such as AD with A being the highest grade such as Republic Polytechnic during 2007 to 2010.

'''Grading'''
*AD/Z: Distinction (Top 5% score in the subject for the cohort)
*A: Excellent (&gt;=80%)very good (75%-79%)
*B: Good (70%-74%)
*C+: Above average (65%-69%)
*C: Average (60%-64%)
*D+: Pass (55%-59%)
*D: Borderline pass (50%-54%)
*F: Fail (&lt;50%)

'''Grade point average'''
*AD/Z: 4.0
*A: 4.0
*B+: 3.5
*B: 3.0
*C+: 2.5
*C: 2.0
*D+: 1.5
*D: 1.0
*F: 0.0

For entrance into local public funded university, refer to the Indicative Grade Profile for each University. Generally, a good GPA is considered 3.5 and above and that does not guarantee that you will get the course that you want as certain popular courses requires extremely high GPA even as it may be considerable easier to study. Currently, only 8 percent of polytechnic students enter established local university like NUS, NTU and SMU. To cater for the increasing aspirations of polytechnic graduates, new Universities such as the [[Singapore Institute of Technology]] (SIT) have been established.

[[Co-curricular activity (Singapore)|CCA]] was also taken into consideration for matriculation. However, from 2007 onwards, local universities have since scrapped the 5% CCA criteria. This means that polytechnic results would comprise 80% while the remaining 20% is made up of O Levels grade. Some [[secondary schools]] also use the [[Grade Point Average]] of the polytechnic Diploma [[system]].

'''Anas "Andy" Shallal''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: أنس شلال) (born March 21, 1955 in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]]) is an [[Iraqi-American]] artist, activist and entrepreneur. He is best known as the proprietor of the Washington, DC area restaurant, bookstore, performance venue [[Busboys and Poets]] and local philanthropist. He is also well known for his opposition to the [[Iraq War|2003 invasion of Iraq]]. He was a 2013 candidate for [[Washington, D.C. mayoral election, 2014|Mayor of Washington, D.C.]] &lt;ref name="DeBonis"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/mike-debonis/wp/2013/11/08/andy-shallal-is-running-for-d-c-mayor/ Andy Shallal is running for D.C. mayor], Mike Debonis, ''Washington Post'', November 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Shallal moved to the United States with his family in 1966. His father was Ambassador of the [[Arab League]], a position he held until [[Saddam Hussein]] seized power, after which they could not return. He graduated from [[Catholic University of America]] and later enrolled in  [[Howard University]] medical school.  Shallal worked as a researcher in medical immunology at the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref name="Business Journal"&gt;[http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2007/07/16/story4.html Shallal to launch third Busboys, a new concept], Erin Killian, ''Washington Business Journal'', July 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Busboys and Poets===
In September 2005, he opened [[Busboys and Poets]] at 14th and V, in the historic [[U Street]] neighborhood. The restaurant features a bookstore, performance space and a mural painted by Shallal. The restaurant was an instant success, embraced by the neighborhood and the progressive community, especially among activists opposed to the [[Iraq War]]. Busboys' clientele has included [[Barack Obama]], [[Howard Zinn]], [[Alice Walker]], [[Cornel West]], [[Naomi Klein]], [[Ben Jealous]], [[Michael Eric Dyson]], [[Nikki Giovanni]], [[Junot Díaz|Junot Diaz]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Moby]], [[Larry King]], [[Melissa Harris-Perry|Melissa Harris Perry]], [[Angela Davis]], [[Brittney Griner]], [[Cory Booker]], [[Maxine Waters]], [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], [[Esperanza Spalding]], [[Howard Dean]], [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]], [[Danny Glover]], and others.

Shallal opened a second Busboys location in Arlington in July 2007, and he opened a third location in the D.C. at 5th &amp; K NW in 2008. A fourth location opened in [[Hyattsville, Maryland]], in summer 2011.&lt;ref name="Business Journal"/&gt; In 2014 Busboys and Poets opened in Brookland. In 2015 Busboys and Poets opened in Takoma.&lt;ref name="WTOP"&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/08/18/3570444/restaurant-and-market-planned.html], WTOP, ''Miami Herald'', August 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently six locations in the Washington, DC area.  [https://dc.curbed.com/2017/5/1/15503856/anacostia-busboys-poets-delivery The seventh Busboys and Poets] is opening in Southeast, D.C. in the neighborhood known as Anacostia.  Busboys and Poets will be bringing the largest bookstore and full-service restaurant to the area. The Peace Ball was noted to have more star power than Donald Trump's Inaugural Ball. 

In 2017 Andy Shallal closed his stores for the day in solidarity with A Day Without Immigrants. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/02/15/jos-andr-s-andy-shallal-to-close-restaurants-for.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace Ball===

Andy is the founder of the Peace Ball inaugural balls. The 2017 Peace Ball took place at the National Museum of African American History and Culture and featured [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], [[Esperanza Spalding]], [[Angela Davis]], [[Van Jones]], [[Cory Booker]], [[Eve Ensler]], [[Jose Andres]], [[Naomi Klein]], [[Fran Drescher]], [[Macklemore]], [[Lana Wachowski]], [[Ellen Page]], and [[Danny Glover]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.vh1.com/news/297162/solange-knowles-to-perform-at-alternative-inauguration-event/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Huffington Post writes &lt;ref&gt;“We can’t be stuck in the past,” Shallal said in an interview. “We have to look at the past, see where we’ve been and see where we come to. The thing about the museum is it really gives you a sense of hope. I mean if you look back sometimes when we’re in the middle of something it really feels daunting, it feels really difficult. It feels like there is no progress but if you step back, you see the arc of history bending towards justice. Courage was throughout, the sense of resilience was throughout, the sense of hope was throughout, the sense of resistance was throughout and I think that’s why it’s very fitting for us to have this ball there, it is the voices of hope and resistance, it is what we are, the Peace Ball.”

He included in the evening’s program a poem from the man who inspired the name of the restaurants, Langston Hughes, perhaps a response to the slogan trademarked by Donald Trump:

We the people must redeem
The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.
The mountains and the endless plain —
All, all the stretch of these great green states —
And make America again!

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eatonville Restaurant===
Eatonville Restaurant is a [[Southern United States|Southern]]-inspired restaurant that opened in 2009 by Andy Shallal, the founder of the restaurant Busboys and Poets.&lt;ref name="biz2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/04/06/tidbits21.html|title=Andy Shallal - Restaurateur, Busboys and Poets|date=April 3, 2009|work=Washington Business Journal|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located across the street from the Busboys and Poets restaurant in [[U Street Corridor]], [[Washington, DC]]. Culture and history are an important part of the restaurant; it is named after and takes its concept from [[Eatonville, Florida|Eatonville]], the hometown of [[Zora Neale Hurston]], an American [[folkloristics|folklorist]] and author during the time of the [[Harlem Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="biz2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="biz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2008/03/24/daily15.html|title=Busboys and Poets owner Andy Shallal to open new D.C. eatery Eatonville|last=Gaynair |first=Gillian|date=March 25, 2008|work=Washington Business Journal|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="examiner"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/entertainment/48785872.html|title=Eatonville brims with culture, history and Southern comfort food|last=Dufour|first=Jeff|date=June 23, 2009|work=[[The Washington Examiner]]|accessdate=2009-07-10}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="citypaper"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/youngandhungry/2008/11/19/andy-shallals-eatonville-to-symbolically-reunite-hughes-and-hurston/|title=Andy Shallal’s Eatonville to Symbolically Reunite Hughes and Hurston|last=Carman|first=Tim|date=November 19, 2008|work=[[Washington City Paper]]|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eatonville clientele has included [[Michelle Obama]], on several occasions, [[Clinton Portis]], Alice Walker, [[Phylicia Rashād]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Tavis Smiley]], [[Gabrielle Union]] and members of Zora Neale Hurston's family. The restaurant features a monthly Food and Folklore series that intertwines storytelling and food.

==== Background ====
Shallal always wanted to use Hurston as an inspiration for the restaurant. In 2007, while talking about his plans for the restaurant, Shallal said: "I'd like to incorporate Zora Neale Hurston into the name. I like taking literary [authors] and using them as springboards."&lt;ref name="biz3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2007/07/16/story4.html|title=Shallal to launch third Busboys, a new concept|last=Killian |first=Erin|date=July 13, 2007|work=Washington Business Journal|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose her because had studied the Harlem Renaissance during college, and wanted to use someone who lived during that period and had a connection to Washington.&lt;ref name="nightout"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressnightout.com/content/2009/06/cooking_by_the_books_anday_shallal.php |title=Cooking by the Books: Andy Shallal of Eatonville |last=O'Steen |first=Danielle |date=June 18, 2009 |work=Express Night Out |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |accessdate=2009-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710212805/http://www.expressnightout.com/content/2009/06/cooking_by_the_books_anday_shallal.php |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eatonville pays homage to Hurston through the [[mural]]s, which were painted by a local artist.&lt;ref name="examiner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zagat.com/Blog/Detail.aspx?SNP=NWDC&amp;SCID=41&amp;BLGID=20090 |title=Exploring Eatonville |date=April 20, 2009 |publisher=[[Zagat Survey]] |accessdate=2009-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426125727/http://www.zagat.com/Blog/Detail.aspx?SNP=NWDC&amp;SCID=41&amp;BLGID=20090 |archivedate=2009-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shallal said she "was the life of the party, so I wanted the space to look lively and gregarious. And she wrote a lot about the porch at Eatonville where the townspeople tell stories, so we put in an area [with rocking chairs] for people to have drinks."&lt;ref name="nightout"/&gt; According to Shallal, [[Carla Hall]] from ''[[Top Chef]]'' judged a "reality TV-style contest" to select Eatonville Restaurant's chef.&lt;ref name="nightout"/&gt;

Amy Cavanaugh in the Decider: DC writes "With this spring's opening of Eatonville, his Zora Neale Hurston-themed restaurant, Andy Shallal is trying to mend a decades-old literary rift between the author and her contemporary, Langston Hughes, whom Shallal's Busboys And Poets chain is named in honor of. The two writers tried to collaborate on a play, Mule Bone, but things went sour: “They fought over copyright issues, but I think they wanted to be friends,” says Shallal. Since the restaurants are across the street from each other, Shallal sees it as a chance to reunite the two writers." &lt;ref name="Decider DC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dc.decider.com/articles/food-and-drink-andy-shallals-eatonville,30189 |title=Food and Drink: Andy Shallal's Eatonville |last=Cavanaugh |first=Amy |date=July 11, 2009 |work=Decided DC |publisher="[[The Onion]]" |accessdate=2009-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716195608/http://dc.decider.com/articles/food-and-drink-andy-shallals-eatonville%2C30189/ |archivedate=2009-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shallal's Green Initiatives ====
"Busboys and Poets is a popular green restaurant: it has plenty of vegan alternatives and organic beer and wines on its menu, and uses recyclable products and wind energy in its operations.  But the venue is so much more than a restaurant.  It houses a fair trade market and bookstore and a space for music shows and poetry slams, and frequently displays local artists’ works." 
"'If you could change one thing about the green business landscape right now, what would it be'?
Make it less elitist and more accessible to ordinary citizens.  Right now green is synonymous with costly.  This needs to change.  It should be more cost effective to operate a green business, yet green businesses face higher costs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenforall.org/what-we-do/capital-access-program/profile-of-a-successful-green-entrepreneur-andy-shallal-busboys-poets |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725174829/http://www.greenforall.org/what-we-do/capital-access-program/profile-of-a-successful-green-entrepreneur-andy-shallal-busboys-poets |archivedate=2010-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Busboys and Poets was awarded one of the first "REAL" restaurants by the United States Healthful Food Council.  REAL (Responsible Epicurean  Agricultural Leadership) Certification is a program of the USHFC to help connect people who want healthful and sustainable food and beverages with the restaurants that provide them.&lt;ref&gt;http://ushfc.org/2013/04/united-states-healthful-food-council-announces-first-real-certified-restaurants/&lt;/ref&gt;

Busboys and Poets and Eatonville Restaurant are members of the American Sustainable Business Council.

Shallal is one of the co-founders of [[Think Local First]] Washington, DC.

==Awards==
Shallal was honored at The DC Vote Champions of Democracy Awards Dinner on Tuesday, October 12, 2010 for advocating for full, equal voting rights for DC.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Shallal has received numerous awards including the Mayor’s Arts Award, Martha's Table Luminary Award, Mayor’s Environmental Award, United Nations Human Rights Community Award, as well as leadership awards in employment and sustainable business practices. He was also named Man of the Year by the Washington Peace Center. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

He was named "Democracy's Restaurateur" by Ralph Nader in a Washington Post article by David Montgomery.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;[https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-12-08/lifestyle/35287154_1_busboys-peace-international-day Andy Shallal, owner of Busboys and Poets, is ‘democracy’s restaurateur’], David Montgomery, ''The Washington Post'', December 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

Shallal has founded or co-founded several [[peace movement]] organizations and holds leadership positions in numerous others. Among them are Iraqi Americans for Peaceful Alternatives, created prior to the [[Iraq war|2003 invasion]], and The Peace Cafe, which seeks to promote Arab-Jewish dialogue. At 800 members it is the largest such group in the Washington, DC area. Shallal is a Peace Fellow with [[Seeds of Peace]], spokesperson for [[Education for Peace in Iraq Center (EPIC)]] and at one point was chair of the board of trustees for Abraham's Vision, a conflict transformation organization working with Muslims, Jews, Palestinians, and Israelis. Shallal is a recipient of the United Nations Human Rights Community Award and has been named Man of the Year by the Washington Peace Center.

In 2005, Shallal spoke at the [[January 20, 2005 counter-inaugural protest|counter-inaugural]] of President [[George W. Bush]] held at [[Meridian Hill Park|Malcolm X Park]]. Later that year, he visited and provided catering at Sheehan's [[Camp Casey, Crawford, Texas|Camp Casey]] protest in [[Crawford, Texas]].&lt;ref name="Guerra"&gt;[http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/cguerra/stories/MYSA081605.1B.guerra.d5dd62a.html War mother and supporters are settling in for a long siege] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226030402/http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/cguerra/stories/MYSA081605.1B.guerra.d5dd62a.html |date=December 26, 2005 }}, Carlos Guerra, ''San Antonio Express-News'', August 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheehan later participated in an Impeachment Forum sponsored by [[Democracy Rising]] at the U Street Busboys location.

He is a [[Foreign Policy In Focus]] analyst for the left-leaning think tank [[Institute for Policy Studies]] and current board member serving as Treasurer.&lt;ref name="IPS"&gt;[http://www.ips-dc.org/about/trustees#Shallal Institute for Policy Studies: Trustees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311180901/http://www.ips-dc.org/about/trustees#Shallal |date=March 11, 2008 }}, ips-dc.org, accessed March 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Cultural Alliance of Greater Washington gave an award to Shallal for his support of the local arts community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cultural alliance honors Busboys and Poets owner |work=The Washington Post |first=Vanessa |last=Mizell |date=May 17, 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/14/AR2010051403900.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2010, Shallal was awarded the Champions of Democracy Award by [[DCVote]] for his activism in support of voting rights for the people of the District of Columbia.

Shallal is a member of [[Restaurant Opportunities Centers United]] (ROC-United) which works to help improve wages and working conditions for restaurant workers.

Shallal also drew an original mural highlighting the struggle to end “Taxation without Representation” that was auctioned off at the gala to benefit DC Vote. “When Iraq got its voting rights,” Shallal said ” I was able to vote in Iraq. I was surprised that I was able to vote in a representative government while I can’t in my own city where I live today.”

==Murals==

Shallal painted the mural at the headquarters of the [[Institute for Policy Studies]] on 16th street NW, which depicts the story of IPS and social movements in which it has been involved. The mural is several hundred square feet and wraps around a 50-seat, square meeting room. Featured in the mural are the Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Benjamin Spock]] and the late Minnesota Senator [[Paul Wellstone]]. Also included are Chilean diplomat and IPS fellow [[Orlando Letelier]] and his assistant [[Ronni Moffitt]], who were [[Letelier case|killed by a car bomb]] on Embassy Row in 1976. The mural depicts former Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] weeping into a handkerchief. As an IPS board member, Shallal painted the mural as a gift to the Institute.

Shallal painted the [[civil rights movement]]-themed mural at Busboys and Poets, called Peace in Struggle Wall. He refuses to sign the civil rights mural at Busboys, saying this would be a "final gesture" that would preclude him from making revisions later.&lt;ref name="Montgomery"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/30/AR2006043001157.html The Muralist], David Montgomery, ''Washington Post'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the Busboys and Poets locations feature an original mural by Shallal.

Shallal's most recent mural, created in August 2013, is at the new [[Anthony Bowen YMCA]], where he is a Board member. The mural honors the legacy of the [[U St Corridor]] and [[Anthony Bowen]].

==Mayoral Campaign 2014==

On November 8, 2013 he formally announced his candidacy for Mayor of Washington, DC, 2014.&lt;ref name="DeBonis"/&gt;
Andy has been referred to as the [[Bill de Blasio]] of D.C. mayoral candidates &lt;ref&gt;http://atthechalkface.com/2013/12/10/is-andy-shallal-the-next-bill-de-blasio/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was endorsed by actor [[Danny Glover]] and writers [[George Pelecanos]] and [[Barbara Ehrenreich]].&lt;ref name=endorsement&gt;{{cite news |title=George Pelecanos: Vote Shallal! |work=The Washington City Paper |first=Will |last=Sommer |date=January 14, 2014 |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/looselips/2014/01/15/george-pelecanos-vote-shallal/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished fifth with 3,196 votes or 3.3% of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.dcboee.org/election_info/election_results/2014/April-1-Primary-Election |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412074919/http://www.dcboee.org/election_info/election_results/2014/April-1-Primary-Election |archive-date=2014-04-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artturi Ilmari Virtanen''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈɑrtːuri ˈilmɑri ˈʋirtɑnen|lang|Fi-Artturi_Ilmari_Virtanen.ogg}}; 15 January 1895 – 11 November 1973)&lt;!--Per MOS, full dates in infobox need not be repeated in lede--&gt; was a [[Finland|Finnish]] chemist and recipient of the 1945 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] "for his research and inventions in agricultural and nutrition chemistry, especially for his fodder preservation method".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1945/ "The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1945"]. Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web. 15 Jun 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

He invented AIV silage which improved milk production and a method of preserving butter, the AIV salt, which led to increased Finnish butter exports.&lt;ref name="KB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=4753 |title= Virtanen, Artturi Ilmari (1895 - 1973) |author=Risto Ihamuotila |date= |website= The National Biography of Finland |publisher= SKS |access-date= January 31, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Virtanen was born in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. He completed his school education at the Classical Lyceum in [[Viipuri]], Finland. He married the botanist Lilja Moisio in 1920 and had two sons with her.&lt;ref name="NP"/&gt;

In 1933 he bought a farm near Helsinki where he tested some of his scientific results in practice.&lt;ref name="KB"/&gt; He saw in the overproduction of food only a temporary phenomenon. He loved the simple life, never had a car of his own, never smoked and never consumed alcohol. He died of pneumonia in November 1973, following a broken femur from a fall few weeks prior. He was buried at the [[Hietaniemi Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hietaniemen hautausmaa– merkittäviä vainajia|url=https://www.helsinginseurakunnat.fi/material/attachments/hautausmaat/hietaniemi/w8GZkM0y7/Hietaniemen_merkittavia_vainajia.pdf |publisher= Kirkko Helsingissä |access-date= November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Virtanen began his studies at the University of Helsinki in chemistry 1913 earning his Master and in 1918 his Phd in organic chemistry. In 1919 he started to work in the laboratories of [[Valio]], a large producer of [[dairy products]] and became director of the laboratory in 1920. Feeling not fully qualified and following his interest in [[botany]] and [[zoology]] led him to further scientific education and so he left [[Valio]] and studied at the [[ETH]], the [[University of Münster]] and the [[University of Stockholm]], [[physical chemistry]], [[soil chemistry]] and [[microbiology]]. In 1923 in Sweden he worked with [[Hans von Euler-Chelpin]], who was awarded with the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1929. Back in Finland he became lecturer at the University of Helsinki in 1924, known for his lectures on chemistry of life. He worked in the laboratory of the Butter Export Association, which became a laboratory of the university. In 1930 the Institute for Biochemistry was founded and Virtanen stayed there until his death in 1973. He became professor of biochemistry at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] in 1931 and at the [[University of Helsinki]] in 1939.

==Career==
His research started with work on the [[phosphorylation]] of [[hexose]]s in 1924. He was able to show that phosphorylation is the first step in many fermentation reactions, which was the foundation of the [[Embden–Meyerhof pathway]].

In 1925 his interests shifted to the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the root nodules of [[Fabaceae|leguminous]] plants. The improved methods of butter preservation, by adding [[disodium phosphate]] to prevent acidic hydrolysis. This method was in use for several decades in Finland. His research from 1925 till 1932 included the invention of a fodder preservation method ([[AIV Fodder]]). The method, patented in 1932, was basically a kind of [[silage]] that improved the storage of green fodder, which is important during long winters. The process includes adding dilute hydrochloric or [[sulfuric acid]] to newly stored grain. Increased acidity stops harmful fermentation and has no adverse effect on the nutritive value of the fodder or the animals it is fed to.
In 1945, Virtanen received the [[Nobel Prize]] in chemistry "for his research and inventions in agricultural and nutrition chemistry".&lt;ref name="NP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1945/index.html |title= The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1945 |date= |website= Nobelprize.org |publisher= Nobel Media AB |access-date= November 24, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His later years studies included the development of partially synthetic cattle feeds. The nitrogen for the synthesis of [[amino acid]]s normally comes from [[protein]]s in the fodder. A special bacterial environment in the [[rumen]] of cattle allows them to use [[urea]] and [[ammonium salt]]s as source for the nitrogen instead of plant proteins like [[soybean]] or [[meat and bone meal]]. He also headed the Valio Laboratory from 1921–1969.

==Awards and honours==
The prestige conferred by the Nobel Prize brought Virtanen invitations, honorary doctorates and membership in foreign academies of science.&lt;ref name="KB"/&gt; He was a member of the Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Flemish, Bavarian, and Pontifical Academies of Science, and of the Swedish and Danish Academies of Engineering Sciences. He was an honorary member of learned societies in Finland, Sweden, Austria, Edinburgh, and the US, and received honorary degrees of the Universities of Lund, Paris, Giessen, and Helsinki, the Royal Technical College at Stockholm, and the Finland Institute of Technology.&lt;ref name="NP"/&gt;

The [[asteroid]] [[1449 Virtanen]], discovered by the renowned Finnish astronomer and physicist [[Yrjö Väisälä]], was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=KWrB1jPCa8AC&amp;q=%281449%29#v=snippet&amp;q=(1449)&amp;f=false |title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names – (1449) Virtanen |last=Schmadel |first=Lutz D. |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |page=116 |date=2003 |isbn=978-3-540-29925-7 |accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lunar crater [[Virtanen (crater)|Virtanen]] is also named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planetary Names: Crater, craters: Virtanen on Moon|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/6406|website=planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov|publisher=NASA|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Colombian-Caribbean American Schools''' (ACCAS) is one of the three [[region]]al associations affiliated with the Tri-Association.  Its membership of 21 schools supports the continuation of an American education in the [[Caribbean]] region and [[Colombia]].  The organization's focus is on school improvement, encouraging an ongoing program of staff development and teacher and student interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accas.org/about-us.html|title=About Us|website=Association of Colombian-Caribbean American Schools|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; New members must be either US-accredited institutions or candidates for [[School accreditation|accreditation]].

==History==
ACCAS was founded in 1961 by five directors of schools in Colombia:
*David Bjork, [[Colegio Nueva Granada]], [[Bogotá]]
*Dale Swall, [[Colegio Bolivar]], [[Cali]]
*Nancy Davidson, [[Columbus School]], [[Medellín]]
*Walter Jarvis, [[Colegio Karl C. Parrish]], [[Barranquilla]]
*Helen Wallace, [[Colegio Jorge Washington]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]

At this stage of its history, the Caribbean region was not included in the Association.

In 1963 [[Colegio Panamericana]] was founded in [[Bucaramanga]] and joined the Association soon thereafter.

The early list of presidents of ACCAS includes:
*1961 David Bjork, Colegio Nueva Granada, [[Bogotá]]
*1963 Raymond Mosley, Columbus School, [[Medellín]]
*1965 James Baker, Colegio Nueva Granada, [[Bogotá]]
*1967 Burton Fox, Colegio Karl C. Parrish, [[Barranquilla]]

Principal activities in early days included student interchanges in [[Sport|athletics]], speech and similar extra curricular programs, all within the boundaries of Colombia. Frequently inexpensive travel via [[Avianca Airlines]] was greatly beneficial in this period.

In 1966 a contract was initiated with the [[University of Alabama]], the Office of Overseas Schools and ACCAS. The objective was to deliver Masters and Doctorate degrees for faculty and administrators employed in the ACCAS schools.

Over the next seven years a large number of M.A.’s and Ph.D.’s came out of this program. The signators to the agreement were: Dr. Ernest N. Mannino, Director, A/OS; Dr. Merlin Duncan, REO, A/OS; Dean Robert Bills, The University of Alabama; Dr. Burton Fox, V.P. for ACCAS.

In 1967, A/OS requested Dr. Fox to visit the [[The Priory School (Kingston)|Priory School]], [[Kingston, Jamaica]]; [[Union School Haiti|Union School]], [[Port-au-Prince, Haiti]]; and the Carol Morgan School, [[Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic]] and explore ways to include these three schools in regional activities. This and subsequent visits resulted in the Union School, (Director, Marie Bogat) and the Carol Morgan School (Director, Roscoe Crowell) joining the Association. The Priory School under Founder and Headmaster, Henry Fowler, joined the following year.

At this time, the name of the Association was changed to the ASSOCIATION OF COLOMBIA-CARIBBEAN AMERICAN SCHOOLS. Soon afterward the first dues were charged: $25 per school per year.

'''Book Aid International''' is a UK registered charity which provides books and supports libraries in Africa and around the world. Every year the charity sends around one million new books to public and community libraries as well as libraries in prisons, refugee camps, hospitals, schools and universities. The charity works in close partnership with libraries and also helps libraries develop their services through its library support projects and programmes. In 2016, an estimated 29.8 million people read the books which Book Aid International provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bookaid.org/|title=Book Aid International {{!}} Home page|website=Book Aid International|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Book Aid International was founded in 1954 by [[The Right Honourable|The Rt Hon.]] [[Hermione, Countess of Ranfurly]], after she moved to [[the Bahamas]] with her husband, [[Daniel Knox, 6th Earl of Ranfurly|The 6th Earl of Ranfurly]], an [[Ulster-Scots people|Ulster-Scots]] nobleman who was [[Governor of the Bahamas]]. Upon touring the islands, Lady Ranfurly was shocked at the lack of reading materials available.

In response, Lady Ranfurly founded the Ranfurly Out Island Library service to provide books in the Bahamas. Over the years, she expanded her work throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and set up an organisation called The Ranfurly Library Service in London. In 1994, the Ranfurly Library Service changed its name to Book Aid International.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bookaid.org/aboutus/our-history/|title=Our history - Book Aid International|work=Book Aid International|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Duke of Edinburgh|His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh]] became the charity’s patron, and his patronage still continues today despite His Roya Highness’ April 2017 retirement from public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-39802701|title=Prince Philip to retire from public engagements|date=2017-05-04|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bookaid.org/2017/05/04/book-aid-international-thanks-royal-highness-duke-edinburgh-51-years-support/|title=Book Aid International thanks His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh for 51 years of support - Book Aid International|date=2017-05-04|work=Book Aid International|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the Department for International Development ended its funding agreement with Book Aid International, requiring them to reduce in staff and countries they work in. It is now entirely funded by a range of trusts, companies and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=313869&amp;subid=0|title=Charity Details|website=beta.charitycommission.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the organisation celebrated its 60th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.londonbookfair.co.uk/RXUK/RXUK_LondonBookFair/LBF%202014/Documents/Book%20Aid%20International%2060th%20anniversary%20booklet_e-version.pdf?v=635287876858638915|title=London Book Fair Book Aid International Celebrates 60 years|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, it has been directed by Alison Tweed (maiden name Hubert), who replaced Clive Nettleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/alison-hubert-joins-book-aid-international/fundraising/article/1135687|title=Alison Hubert joins Book Aid International|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Paul Boateng, Baron Boateng|Lord Boateng]] became the charity’s Chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/lord-boateng-new-chair-book-aid-international|title=Lord Boateng new chair of Book Aid International {{!}} The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''CUNY Academic Commons''' is an online, academic social network for faculty, staff, and graduate students of the [[CUNY|City University of New York (CUNY)]] system. Designed to foster conversation, collaboration, and connections among the 24&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuny.edu/about.html], CUNY about 2012&lt;/ref&gt; individual colleges that make up the university system,&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/cuny-social-network-mixes-scholarship-with-facebook-style-friendship/27266 Kaya], 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the site, founded in 2009, has quickly grown as a hub for the CUNY community, serving in the process to strengthen a growing group of digital scholars, teachers, and [[open-source software|open-source]] projects at the university.

As stated in the site's [http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/about/tos/ Terms of Service], members "seek to use the Academic Commons as a means of fulfilling our highest aspirations for integrating technology into our teaching, learning, and collaborating."

== Information silos vs. shareable knowledge ==
[[File:Victory Silos.JPG|thumb|right|Information can get stuck in Institutional Silos]] In their case study of the CUNY Academic Commons, published in ''On the Horizon'', [http://news.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2011/03/casestudy.jpg Gold &amp; Otte] (2011) note that, prior to the CUNY Academic Commons, little "cross-campus communication" between like-minded faculty and graduate students existed. CUNY was a "loose federation" of campuses, largely represented by static websites. The need for a university-wide means of sharing knowledge was perceived by CUNY Committee on Academic Technology, and discussions began in early 2008 to find a solution.

[http://www.brandon-hall.com/workplacelearningtoday/?p=12348g Nantel] (2010), [http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/cuny-social-network-mixes-scholarship-with-facebook-style-friendship/27266 Kaya] (2010), and others have similarly observed how information can easily get stuck in institutional "silos". [[Social networks]], like the CUNY Academic Commons, can "help open communications between departments" and improve knowledge transfer ([http://www.brandon-hall.com/workplacelearningtoday/?p=12348g Nantel]). While countering the "prospect of missed connections" was a principal reason why the CUNY Academic Commons was formed, serendipitous discovery became a technological goal. Developers of the site (primarily faculty and graduate students) experimented with [[social media]] tools to see how best to connect scholars, while not being too intrusive in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2011/03/casestudy.jpg Gold &amp; Otte]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Work began in 2008 to create a [[Institutional repository|repository]] of "[[learning object]]s" which could be easily shared and archived, and which were designed to constantly evolve. The Committee on Academic Technology reached out to the various campuses for ideas, and feedback indicated that the site should be "open and organic" and flexible enough to respond to the diverse needs of the faculty. The first beta version of the site was created in February, 2009, and after much tinkering, CUNY Academic Commons was officially launched in December of the same year.&amp;nbsp; The site has seen "rapid adoption".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2011/03/casestudy.jpg Gold &amp; Otte]&lt;/ref&gt; Membership as of May 2011 was nearly 2000, while the number of blogs on the site was close to 400. By 2017, even after deleting inactive users, membership was estimated at 7900.

From the very beginning, the site was a "space of open experimentation, open communication, and open sharing."&amp;nbsp; A participatory network encourages "peer-to-peer learning among faculty members" and is "a generative platform"&amp;nbsp;which makes "the professoriate of the largest urban public university system in the world more visible to itself and to a wider public," according to [http://news.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2011/03/casestudy.jpg Gold &amp; Otte].

In her critique in [[Yale University]]’s Collaborative Learning Center blog,&lt;ref&gt;[http://clc.yale.edu/2011/03/02/the-cuny-academic-commons-building-the-social-university/ Kristjiana Gong]&lt;/ref&gt; Kristjiana Gong (2010)&amp;nbsp;finds several ways CUNY Academic Commons is able to build a "social university":
*transparency in development and support
*porous boundaries between users and support at all levels
*regular communication
*users are engaged in creating a warmer community

Since funding did not permit a full-service site, a small team of software developers and community facilitators began to shape the Commons with a "self-service approach" in which faculty and graduate students were largely responsible for building their own sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2011/03/casestudy.jpg Gold &amp; Otte]&lt;/ref&gt; An [[open-source model]] was adopted in which the community as a whole was responsible for testing, defect reporting, and ideas for enhancements.

The CUNY Academic Commons has a strong ethos of giving back to the [[WordPress]] and [[BuddyPress]] community.&amp;nbsp; Writing for WPMU.org, [http://wpmu.org/15-go-to-places-for-wordpress-and-buddypress-news-tips-and-tutorials/ Siobhan Ambrose] (2011) notes that the site has released many significant BuddyPress plug-ins and regularly shares tips and hacks with the BuddyPress network.

== More than an LMS ==
The CUNY Academic Commons is not primarily a Learning Management System ([[Learning management system|LMS]]). While popular LMS systems such as [[Blackboard Learning System|Blackboard]] aim to provide academic course spaces for individual courses within institutions, the Commons is designed to facilitate conversation and collaboration among colleagues both within and between colleges in the system. Because of its [[Do it yourself|do-it-yourself]], open-source approach to scholarly communication, the Commons has sometimes been characterized as an alternative to LMS systems. Writing in the ''ProfHacker'' blog at the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', for instance, [http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/wordpress-a-better-lms/23050 David Parry] (2010) finds that "Blackboard and the other bloated Learning Management Systems" interfere with student learning; Parry writes that the CUNY Academic Commons is "an example of what could be done University wide if the instructors wanted to drop Blackboard and commit to a better solution."

Even though the CUNY Academic Commons is closed to undergraduates, it is still a tool for teaching graduate courses and a hub for sharing pedagological resources. CUNY teaching projects that share the technical architecture, open source ethos, and DIY approach of the Commons include [http://blsciblogs.baruch.cuny.edu/ Blogs@Baruch] and [http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/ Eportfolios@Macaulay], and [http://lookingforwhitman.org/ Looking for Whitman].

== Facebook comparisons ==
Many reviews in the current literature&lt;ref&gt;[http://clc.yale.edu/2011/03/02/the-cuny-academic-commons-building-the-social-university/ Gong], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educause.edu/EDUCAUSE+Review/EDUCAUSEReviewMagazineVolume45/NeverMindtheEdupunksorTheGreat/209326 Lamb &amp; Groom], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/New-College-Networks-Unlike/124871/ Kaya], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuny.edu/news/publications/cunymatters/april2010/facebook-for-faculty.html Roel], 2010&lt;/ref&gt; point out similarities between the CUNY Academic Commons and [[Facebook]]. But as [http://chronicle.com/article/New-College-Networks-Unlike/124871/ Kaya] (2010) contends in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', Facebook does not offer the kind of academic interaction that is available with sites such as the CUNY Academic Commons which "mix serious academic work, and connections among working scholars." Indeed, the CUNY Academic Commons emphasizes the "productivity oriented features of social networking" and "collaborative academic work" ([http://news.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2011/03/casestudy.jpg Gold &amp; Otte]) that is not generally found in commercial social networks. As [http://learningthroughdigitalmedia.net/beyond-friending-buddypress-and-the-social-networked-open-source-classroom Gold] (2011) writes in "Beyond Friending: BuddyPress and the Social, Networked, Open-Source Classroom" that students are often reluctant to mix social networks with academic networks. Faculty too, it may be inferred, value distinct, professional networks where they can focus on their scholarship.

== Open source technical infrastructure ==
CUNY Academic Commons is built entirely with open source software: [[WordPress]] with Multisite, [[BuddyPress]] and [[MediaWiki]]. It uses [[MYSQL]] as a database and runs under [[Linux]]. [[BuddyPress]], a powerful WordPress [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] which transforms a multi-user WordPress site into a [[social network]], serves as the site's hub. As one of its spokes, MediaWiki is seamlessly integrated into the site and lets users collaborate on projects and build knowledge bases. Users are allowed to create as many [[blogs]] and groups as they want. As [http://www.educause.edu/EDUCAUSE+Review/EDUCAUSEReviewMagazineVolume45/NeverMindtheEdupunksorTheGreat/209326 Lamb &amp; Groom] (2011) write in '''''[[Educause]]''''': "the jaw-dropping CUNY Academic Commons … seamlessly integrates the [[open-source software|open-source]] … platforms into an appealing and highly sustainable environment."

== Grants and awards ==

=== Commons in a Box ===
In November, 2011, the CUNY Academic Commons received a $107,500 grant from the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] to create '''Commons in a Box''', a "new [[open-source software|open-source]] project that will help other organizations quickly and easily install and customize their own Commons platforms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2011/11/22/the-cuny-academic-commons-announces-the-commons-in-a-box-project/ Gold, M. 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', [http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/creating-new-academic-networks-with-commons-in-a-box/34453 Jennifer Howard] notes that the CUNY Academic Commons will first "work with the [[Modern Language Association]] on a pilot project to create an 'MLA Commons' for its more than 30,000 members" to help promote their scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/creating-new-academic-networks-with-commons-in-a-box/34453 Howard, J. 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sloan-C Award For Effective Practice ===
At their [http://sloanconsortium.org/conference/2012/et4online/about 5th Annual International Symposium for Emerging Technologies for Online Learning] on July 25–27, 2012, the [[Sloan Consortium]] presented an award to the CUNY Academic Commons for effective practices in online and blended education. "'''The CUNY Academic Commons: Social Network as Hatchery'''" was one of six winning practices recognized for a number of criteria, including "innovation and replicability" and the ability to advance “the goals of access, learning effectiveness, faculty and student satisfaction, and scalability.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/Sloan-C/EffectivePracticeAwards/prweb9672290.htm Sloan-C, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Frederick St John Jesson''' (born 23 August 1935)&lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/02U6vAmnLtcgP_KEhdr6aoKc7O4/appointments Companies House]&lt;/ref&gt; is a British educationalist and a Professor in the Department of Economics at the [[University of York]]. He is a recognised expert on [[specialist school]]s and value-added performance ([[Contextual value added|CVA]]).

==Early life==
He was born in Hackney in 1935, the son of Frederick John and Florence Jesson and attended the [[University of Manchester]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. He became a Maths teacher, teaching in several schools, state and independent. He taught at [[Charterhouse School]] and [[Lincoln Christ's Hospital School]].

===University===
He started working at universities when he joined the [[University of Sheffield]]. At Sheffield he developed the contextual [[Contextual value added|value-added system]] of school performance measurement. This involves looking at the relative improvement of pupils, not their absolute performance - how much 'value' has been 'added'.

In 1995 he joined the [[University of York]] as Professor in the Economics department. He works in the CPERM department, in the Department of Economics and Related studies, under Professor David Mayston.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.york.ac.uk/economics/our-people/staff-profiles/david-mayston/ David Mayston]&lt;/ref&gt;

==His research==
His work on 'value-added' performance came from the belief that working from absolute exam grades was too crude a measurement, as pupils from different backgrounds and schools found it much more of a challenge to gain the same grades as someone from a more privileged background. It was like comparing apples with pears.

===Science education===
In 2007 he found that 68% of all comprehensive schools - around 2,020 - do not offer the three separate science courses at GCSE, and that only one in 20 pupils at state schools take physics, chemistry and biology at GCSE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-497489/British-students-slip-world-league-tables-science.html Daily Mail November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academically bright children===
In a report in April 2008 for the [[Specialist Schools and Academies Trust]], he found that academically bright children at [[comprehensive school]]s were likely to do better when there were more academically bright children at the same school. This was from data of more than 150,000 children, and involved his 'value-added' measurements. The higher the proportion of 'able' pupils, the better the value-added performance.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-563142/Classes-bright-children-shine.html Daily Mail May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, he reported at the Birmingham annual conference of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (which represented around 2,400 secondary schools) that pupils at private school in the top academic 5% were almost guaranteed to get three A-grades at A-level, yet for state schools only a third of the top 5% would get three A-grades. He called this a 'severe talent drain' in the state school system. In the same speech he said that Britain's future economic success depended on identifying and nurturing this top 5% of pupils. It had been calculated by tracking performance of pupils from 1999 to 2004.

==Personal life==
In 1965 he married Catherine Whitehead; they had three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://freebmd.rootsweb.com/cgi/search.pl| title = Freebmd Search|accessdate= 10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lives in [[St. Ives, Cornwall]].

The '''Education Law Association (ELA)''' is a professional organization composed of school and university administrators, professors, consultants, and attorneys, for the purpose of interdisciplinary dialogue regarding legal issues in education. This is accomplished through seminars, webinars, an annual conference, and the highest quality monographs and books, some of which are popular graduate textbooks. Members receive special pricing on most products and events, and also receive monthly and quarterly updates, access to an online searchable case database of summaries of cases in education law, and numerous other products and services not available to the public.

'''Annual Conference'''

'''Publications'''

'''History'''

Founded in 1954 during an education conference at Duke University, the National Organization on Legal Problems in Education was founded with 57 members from 15 states and the District of Columbia. Within six weeks of its inception, NOLPE had 205 members from 40 states, the District of Columbia and Guam.

The first annual meeting was held in the fall of 1955 at the University of Chicago and the first full-sized book was published in 1958, titled Law and the School Superintendent. By 1963, nearly one-third of the membership were attorneys.

The annual conference attracts hundreds of participants and attendees from around the United States and a number of other countries. The conference has been held in such places as Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, Miami Beach, Las Vegas, New Orleans, and Nassau, Bahamas. In 1994, NOLPE officially became known as the Education Law Association.

'''Past Presidents of ELA'''

'''Friedrich Ludwig''' "'''Fritz'''" '''Bauer''' (10 June 1924 – 26 March 2015) was a German [[computer scientist]] and professor at the [[Technische Universität München|Technical University of Munich]].

==Life==
Bauer earned his [[Abitur]] in 1942 and served in the [[Wehrmacht]] during World War II, from 1943 to 1945. From 1946 to 1950, he studied mathematics and [[Physics|theoretical physics]] at [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität]] in [[Munich]]. Bauer received his doctorate under the supervision of [[Fritz Bopp]] for his thesis ''Gruppentheoretische Untersuchungen zur Theorie der Spinwellengleichungen'' ("Group-theoretic investigations of the theory of spin wave equations") in 1952. He completed his [[habilitation]] ''Über quadratisch konvergente Iterationsverfahren zur Lösung von algebraischen Gleichungen und Eigenwertproblemen'' ("On quadratically convergent iteration methods for solving algebraic equations and eigenvalue problems") in 1954 at the [[Technical University of Munich]]. After teaching as ''[[privatdozent]]'' at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität from 1954 to 1958, he became extraordinary professor for applied mathematics at the [[University of Mainz]]. Since 1963, he worked as a professor of mathematics and (since 1972) computer science at Technical University of Munich. He retired in 1989.&lt;ref name="GutenbergBiographics2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Verzeichnis der Professorinnen und Professoren der Universität Mainz|url=http://gutenberg-biographics.ub.uni-mainz.de/id/f197cbba-1453-4ffd-8de6-24d75a2dece6.html|website=Gutenberg Biographics|publisher=Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz|accessdate=16 February 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bauer's early work involved the construction of computing machinery (e.g. the logical relay computer STANISLAUS from 1951-1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hashigen|editor1-first=Ulf|editor2-last=Keil-Slawik|editor2-first=Reinhard|editor3-last=Norberg|editor3-first=Arthur L.|title=History of Computing: Software Issues|date=2002|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin Heidelberg New York|isbn=978-3-642-07653-4|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In this context, he was the first to propose the widely used [[Stack (data structure)|stack method]] of expression evaluation. Bauer also worked in the committees that developed the [[Imperative programming|imperative]] computer [[programming language]]s [[ALGOL 58]] and its successor [[ALGOL 60]], important predecessors to all modern imperative programming languages. In 1968, Bauer coined the term ''[[Software Engineering]]'' which has been in widespread use since.

Bauer was an influential figure in establishing [[computer science]] as an independent subject in German universities.

His scientific contributions spread from [[numerical analysis]] ([[Bauer–Fike theorem]]) and fundamentals of interpretation and translation of programming languages, to his later works on systematics of program development, especially [[program transformation]] methods and systems ([[CIP-S]]) and the associated [[wide-spectrum language]] system [[CIP-L]]. He also wrote a well-respected book on [[cryptology]], ''Decrypted secrets'', now in its fourth edition.

He was the [[doctoral advisor]] of 39 students, including [[Manfred Broy]], [[David Gries]], [[Manfred Paul]], [[Gerhard Seegmüller]], [[Josef Stoer]], [[Peter Wynn (mathematician)|Peter Wynn]], and [[Christoph Zenger]].

Friedrich Bauer was married to Hildegard Bauer-Vogg. He was the father of three sons and two daughters.

==Definition of software engineering==
Bauer was a colleague of the German Representative the NATO Science Committee. In 1967, NATO had been discussing 'The Software Crisis' and Bauer had suggested the term 'Software Engineering' as a way to conceive of both the problem and the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mechanizing Proof: Computing, Risk, and Trust |first=Donald |last=MacKenzie |year=2001 |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-13393-8 |pages=34–36 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=QiMS8t4V_0cC |page=34 }} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Bauer published the following definition of software engineering:&lt;br&gt;
"Establishment and use of sound engineering principles to economically obtain software that is reliable and works on real machines efficiently."&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, F.L., "Software Engineering", Information Processing, 71, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''General Certificate of Education''' ('''GCE''') is a subject-specific family of academic qualifications that [[examination board|awarding bodies]] in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Education in the Crown dependencies|Crown dependencies]] and a few [[Commonwealth countries]], notably [[Sri Lanka]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], confer on students. (The [[Education in Scotland|Scottish education system]] is different from those in the other countries of the United Kingdom).

The GCE is composed of three levels; they are, in increasing order of difficulty: 
* the [[GCE Ordinary Level | Ordinary Level]] ("O Level");
* the [[Advanced Subsidiary Level]] ("A1 Level" or "AS Level"), higher than the O Level, serving as a level in its own right, and functioning as a precursor to the full Advanced Level; and
* [[Advanced Level]] ("A Level").

==History==

==England and Wales==
The General Certificate of Education (GCE) was established in England and Wales after the Second World War, along with the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE). Both these examinations set out to provide a national standard of public examinations, within the wider reform of secondary education under the Education Act of 1943 (The Baker Act). Prior to the war, the standards of education offered by different local education authorities varied widely, and whilst some urban education authorities supported Technical Schools, others, particularly in rural areas, offered only "Higher Elementary" education to the majority of pupils. The Education Act of 1943 established a strategy to deliver a universal secondary education system fit for the post-war social and economic reconstruction of the country. It envisaged three distinct types of schools: Grammar Schools, Technical Schools and Secondary Modern Schools, all to be provided at public expense, and each of which where intended to provide education appropriate to the abilities and aspirations of their pupils. The syllabii and examination standards of both GCE and CSE should be seen in this context. 

The General Certificate of Education set out to provide a national standard for matriculation to university undergraduate courses. It had two levels, Ordinary and Advanced, which rapidly became known throughout the education system as "O levels" and "A Levels." Ordinary levels were usually taken at the age of 16 - the statutory minimum school leaving age - and Advanced levels at the age of 18 after a further two year course. Both the O level and A level courses were examined by subject and matriculation (the minimum standard for university entrance) was set at five passes in different subjects, of which two had to be at A level. 

For matriculation purposes the highest grade pass of a subject taken at CSE level was considered a pass at O level.

In the English education system both the GCE and CSE examinations were replaced in the 1980's with the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), which set out to provide a multi-level examination system catering for all abilities of secondary school pupils. This supported the ongoing development of a comprehensive education system, which recognised education as a fundamental human right, and sought to avoid the risk of writing children off at the age of eleven which had become apparent as an undesirable by-product of the 11+ selection system

===Examination Boards (England)===
Though the GCE was considerd a national standard there was no national syllabus, and it was run by a number of different Examination Boards, each of which set their own syllabii and papers. These included the "Northern Universities Joint Matriculation Board"—generally known as the JMB, The University of London ("The London Board") and the "Oxford and Cambridge Board."

Examination sessions were held bi-annually in May and November and successful candidates received a certificate listing the subjects they had passed in the session, together with the marks achieved in each. In the earliest years of the system subject marks were given as percentages at both Ordinary and Advanced Level. In later years  ordinary level pass marks were graded 1-6, with 1 being the highest. The grading system was further simplified in 1975 when the six pass marks were reduced to three, graded A, B, C. In normalised terms at O level the lower bound for A was then 70% and the lower bound for C 45%. For matriculation purposes C was the lowest pass grade. D, E and F grades were also shown for the first time—indicating that a paper had been sat but the student had not achieved a pass mark.

In the late 1970s, A level certificates showed grades from A to F. At A level E was considered a pass for matriculation, and corresponded to 30%. All these examinations were closed book and Art was the only subject for which any assignment outside the examination hall contributed to the final mark.

==Scotland==
GCE Ordinary and Advanced levels did not exist within the Scottish Education system, but had an equivalent, administered by the Scottish Education Department, part of the Scottish Office. This  predated the GCE and also had two levels, originally called Higher Grade and Lower Grade. Lower grade was renamed the Ordinary Grade around the time that the GCE O level was established. The two were exact equivalents. Higher grade however was a lower level course than the A level and taken over one year—preparing students for entry to Scottish Universities which had 4-year degree courses, traditionally commenced at the age of 17.

The Scottish "O grade" was replaced by a new examination, the "standard grade" phased in over several years in the late 1980s. This in turn has been replaced (2015–18) by a new examination the "National Level 5", however the Higher examination remains the matriculation standard for Scottish Universities, though most school leavers destined for university today remain for a further year in school taking further courses.{{update|date=October 2018}}

==Northern Ireland==
The secondary education system in Northern Ireland continues to use the GCE Ordinary and Advanced level system. It also retains selection to grammar school by the 11+ examination: A public examination which selects children as suitable for an academic (essentially a liberal arts) secondary syllabus from the age of eleven to eighteen.

==The GCE today==
Though the GCE was replaced in the English Education system in the 1980s, some examination boards continue to offer Ordinary and Advanced level examinations to English Language schools overseas. This enables these students to obtain matriculation instantly recognisable to British Universities. 

Significant numbers of private schools in England have also reverted to preparing pupils for GCE examinations.

Letter grades are used, with A, B, C, D, and E representing a pass and U (unclassified) representing a fail.  After leading British universities had expressed concerns that the A grade alone would no longer be enough to distinguish the most exceptional candidates, the A* grade was introduced (GCSE, the replacement of GCE and CSE){{clarify|date=October 2016}} for students who achieve 80% and above in the overall A-Level qualification and achieve 90% and over in all A2 (this applies to GCSE and not GCE but may apply to CSE) modules.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Former qualifications==
In the past, a [[Scholarship Level|Scholarship / Special / "S-Level"]] / [[Advanced Extension Award|Advanced Extension Award (AEA)]] existed; an Advanced Supplementary Level (designated "AS Level" but not to be confused with the modern-day AS Level, which is lower than the A Level) qualification was also formerly available.

==University admissions==
The General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (GCE "A Levels") is an entry qualification for universities in the United Kingdom and many other locations worldwide. 

The US equivalent of the GCE for admissions would be, roughly, the [[High School Diploma]]. However, in England and Wales, the high school diploma is considered to be at the level of the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE), which is awarded at Year 11.&lt;ref name="UCASIntQuals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ac.uk/media/arts/colleges/lcf/courses/application-forms/int-quals2013.pdf |title=International Qualifications for entry into college or university in 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225115515/http://www.arts.ac.uk/media/arts/colleges/lcf/courses/application-forms/int-quals2013.pdf |archivedate=25 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChavegnesUSInfo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chavagnes.org/news/Info_for_US_families.shtml |title=Info for US Families |publisher=Chavegnes International College |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704014828/http://www.chavagnes.org/news/Info_for_US_families.shtml |archivedate=4 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[sixth form|college]] and [[university]] admissions, the high school diploma may be accepted in lieu of the GCSE if an average grade of C is obtained in subjects with a GCSE counterpart.&lt;ref name="UCASIntQuals" /&gt;

As the more academically rigorous [[GCE Advanced Level|A Levels]] awarded at Year 13 are expected for university admission, the high school diploma alone is generally not considered to meet university requirements. Students who wish to study in the United Kingdom may additionally participate in the [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) or [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) programs, which are considered to be at the level of the A Level qualifications and earn points on the [[UCAS Tariff]],&lt;ref name="UCASIntQuals" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UCASTariffTables"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.com/how-it-all-works/explore-your-options/entry-requirements/tariff-tables |title=UCAS Tariff Tables |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027224702/http://www.ucas.com/how-it-all-works/explore-your-options/entry-requirements/tariff-tables |archivedate=27 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or may opt to take A Level examinations in British [[international school]]s or as private candidates. Standardized tests, such as the [[College Board]]'s [[SAT]] and [[SAT Subject Test]]s or the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], may also be considered.

The [[Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]] (UCAS) recommends that in addition to a high school diploma, grades of 3 or above in at least two, or ideally three, Advanced Placement exams may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.&lt;ref name="UCASIntQuals" /&gt; The [[IB Diploma]] may also be accepted. For College Board tests, a minimum score of 600 or higher in all sections of the SAT or a minimum score of 26 or higher in all sections of the ACT along with a minimum score of 600 in relevant SAT Subject Tests may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.&lt;ref name="UCASIntQuals" /&gt;

==Worldwide use==
===Brunei===
Up to now, most schools in Brunei are under GCE, the levels are of O-level, A-level, and AS-level{{please clarify|reason=Does Brunei's "AS" correspond to the older British higher-than-A-level "AS" or the newer British lower-than-A-level AS?|date=May 2017}} Examinations are conducted by the Examinations Department of Brunei Darussalam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtbnews.rtb.gov.bn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13218:brunei-cambridge-gce-and-igcse-result&amp;catid=34:local&amp;Itemid=66 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218082918/http://www.rtbnews.rtb.gov.bn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13218:brunei-cambridge-gce-and-igcse-result&amp;catid=34:local&amp;Itemid=66 |archivedate=18 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
The two educational qualifications, [[Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination]] (HKCEE) and [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]] (HKALE), were the two school-leaving exams until they were replaced by the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE). The HKDSE eventually replaced the two exams by only having one public exam in high school year 3 (year 12). [[English Schools Foundation]] (though scome schools are also adopting the [[IB Diploma]] program).

===Malaysia===
GCE examinations in Malaysia were used to be conducted by the [University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate], when two agencies of the Malaysian Ministry of Education took over the role with UCLES retaining an advisory role on standards.

The GCE O-Level equivalent is the ''[[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia]]'' (SPM, formerly known in English as the Malaysian Certificate of Education (MCE)), conducted by the Lembaga Peperiksaan Malaysia (LPM, the Malaysian Examinations Syndicate). The SPM is taken by all fifth-year secondary school students in Malaysia. The SPM English Language paper is graded separately by the LPM and by UCLES (which still awards a GCE O-Level for the paper), and both grades are displayed on the results slip.

The GCE A-Level equivalent is the ''[[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia]]'' (STPM, formerly known in English as the Malaysian Higher School Certificate (HSC)), conducted by the Majlis Peperiksaan Malaysia (MPM, the Malaysian Examinations Council). The STPM is taken by students after a one-and-a-half-year [[sixth form]] course. The STPM is accepted for admission to universities worldwide.

=== Pakistan ===
Pakistan also runs the GCE education level. Some of Pakistan's top schools offers this course. A Pakistani student currently holds the world record for attaining the highest number of A's in A-Level. [[Haroon Tariq]] scored 30 A's in [[GCE Advanced Level]]. [[Haroon Tariq]] also holds the world record for most A's (28) in O-levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dawn.com/news/1039680|title=47 As in O, A levels: Pakistani student beats world record|first=A|last=Reporter|date=1 September 2013|website=dawn.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416073412/https://www.dawn.com/news/1039680|archivedate=16 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has 29 A grades in IGCSE which is also a world record. [[Haroon Tariq]] has a total of 7 world records. [http://www.thenewstribe.com/2014/11/13/pakistani-student-haroon-tariq-claims-world-records]

===Singapore===
Students take the [[Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level|O-Levels]] after completing Secondary 4 at age 16 for the Special and Express streams, or Secondary 5 at age 17 for the Normal Academic Stream. After that, they have the option to go on to a junior college for two years in preparation for the [[Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level|A-Levels]] or study a vocational trade and earn a diploma at a [[Institute of technology|polytechnic]] or technical school. Increasingly, students who perform well in school are given the option to bypass the O-levels and take the A-Levels, in a scheme dubbed the [[Education in Singapore#Integrated Programme|integrated programme]] (also known as the ''through-train'' programme).

===Sri Lanka===
In [[Sri Lanka]] [[GCE Ordinary Level in Sri Lanka|GCE Ordinary Level]] and [[GCE Advanced Level in Sri Lanka|GCE Advanced Level]] examinations are conducted by the [[Department of Examinations]] of the Government of Sri Lanka. The GCE(O/L) is normally conducted in the month of December and GCE (A/L)s are conducted in the month of August. They are conducted on an island-wide examination centres on same time. Examination entrance is restricted by a minimal number of formal school going years and laboratory field work. The majority of candidates enter the exams via their respective schools, while candidates who have finished school education can also apply as a private candidate.

The O/L examination is regarded as the qualification examination for starting on GCE(A/L). Specialization streaming is depended on the grades obtained for subjects in the O/L. The country's reputed schools admit students to their A/L, depending on the O/L grades.

The Sri Lankan University Grants commission determines the cut-off points for the selection of students to the Sri Lankan universities according to the grade points obtained in the A/L examinations based on the standard [[normal distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The University Admissions Policy For Local Candidates| date= | publisher=UGC | url =http://www.ugc.ac.lk/admissions/Local/Admission%20policy%20local.html| work =University Grants Commission - Sri Lanka.| accessdate =11 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070602204146/http://www.ugc.ac.lk/admissions/Local/Admission+policy+local.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
Bangladesh also has the GCE A-Level and GCE O-Level. There are many schools which follow the British Curriculum.

===Cameroon===
In [[Cameroon]], the [[GCE Ordinary Level]] examination is a 3-year course program starting from Form 3 to Form 5 (Years 9 to 11). It is usually written in Form 5 (Year 11) in [[Secondary schools]], meanwhile the [[GCE Advanced Level]] examinations are written in Upper 6 (Year 13) in [[High school]]. Most Secondary schools in Cameroon which do the English form of education and write both the GCE A-Level and O-Level examinations were [[boarding schools]] but since then many day schools were opened which offered a complete GCE course and anyone wishing to have an English education are no more obliged to go for boarding schools. The GCE saw changes in syllabus content at the ordinary and advanced levels in some science subjects in order to adapt to the world's advancing school program.

During Easter break around March, students in these boarding schools stay for GCE courses for a week and a few days in school for extra classes in order to cover up their syllabus. 
At the end of the school year, all students in other classes except the GCE candidates leave and they stay for their Revisions and preparation towards the upcoming exams in Late-May. Once the candidates finish writing in early June, they all return to their various homes, waiting to hear their results. The same thing applies for GCE candidates in day schools. The results for the GCE O-Level and A-level exams in Cameroon are announced around mid-July.

'''Henry Sass''' (24 April 1788 &amp;ndash; 1844) was an English artist and teacher of painting, who founded an important art school, '''Sass's Academy''' (later "Cary's Academy"), in [[London]], to provide training for those seeking to enter the [[Royal Academy]]. Many distinguished British painters received their early training here.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Sass, Henry|volume=50|pages=310-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was Sass's commitment to art education that [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] said he could have "taught a stone to draw".&lt;ref name=flount&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wzDMc9U4ccYC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq=%22Henry+Sass%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oRloTIThJcmI4QbAn5yZBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Henry%20Sass%22&amp;f=false London higher: the establishment of higher education in London], Roderick Floud, p.282, 1998, accessed 15 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

Sass was born in [[London]]. His father, who was also an artist, belonged to an old [[Courland]] family from what is now [[Latvia]]. Sass's father and mother settled in London after their marriage and his elder half-brother [[Richard Sass]] became a landscape painter and art tutor to members of the royal family.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Sass became a student at the [[Royal Academy]] and practised his art by copying paintings held at the [[British Institution]]. His early work which was exhibited in 1807 and 1808 at the Royal Academy included, "The Descent of Ulysses into Hell" which Sass also executed as an etching. However his later work was portraiture. In 1815 he married Mary Robinson, whose family was related to the Earls of Ripon. In the same year he travelled to [[Italy]], returning two years later.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; However, despite publishing a book about his Italian trip&lt;ref&gt;Henry Sass. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2OMNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A journey to Rome and Naples, performed in 1817]'' (London: Longman, Hurst, Reese, Orme &amp; Brown, 1818)&lt;/ref&gt; he was not able to make a living from his painting.

Sass decided to open the first school of drawing for artists who were intending to study at the Royal Academy' school. Sass established it in a house at No. 6 [[Charlotte Street]], at the corner with [[Streatham Street]], in [[Bloomsbury]], London. Sass's pupils included Sir [[John Millais]] P.R.A., [[Charles West Cope]] K.A., [[William Powell Frith]] R.A., [[William Edward Frost]] R.A.&lt;ref&gt;P.R.A. = President of the Royal Academy; R.A. = Royal Academician.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Thomas Lawrence]] the President of the Royal Academy was amongst the school's supporters. Such was Sass's commitment to art education that [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilie]] said he could have taught a "stone to draw".&lt;ref name=flount/&gt;

Sass's Academy is caricatured in the novel "[[The Newcomes]]" by [[W. M. Thackeray|Thackeray]], who was once a student at the school.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; The real academy, however, is only used as a basis for the fictional art school and Thackeray does not refer to Sass or his school in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland McMaster. ''Thackeray's cultural frame of reference: allusion in The Newcomes'' (McGill-Queen's University Press, 1991) pp. 91-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sass was now well off and he and Mary entertained the intelligentsia of the day. Among his friends were [[Sir Edwin Landseer]], [[William Etty]], and particularly [[J. M. W. Turner]]. Two years before his death Sass passed the directorship of the school to [[Francis Stephen Cary]] due to his failing mental health.&lt;ref name=flount/&gt; Sass died in 1844, having had nine children including an eldest surviving son, '''Henry William Sass''' who was an architect and '''Edwin Etty Sass''' who entered the medical profession.

The '''ICFES exam''', currently Saber 11, is a [[standardized test]] similar to the [[SAT]] in the United States. The test is administered prior to graduation in [[Education in Colombia|Colombian high schools]] final year, 11th or 12th. It can be taken as many times as a student sees fit. The test is thoroughly developed and published by the ICFES. The exam, evaluates five subjects; Critical Reading, Math, Social Studies, Science and English. Each subject mostly consist of several multiple option questions with four possible answers and between one and three open questions, except English which has no open questions and the multiple option questions can have between three and eight possible answers. The ICFES exam qualifies between 1 and 500, and each subject between 1 and 100.

Although the ICFES provides several tests for different academic purposes, the ICFES test is nationally recognized as the most important test since it qualifies students according to their actual academic skills and therefore it can affect the possibilities that a student might have to be accepted in Public and Private Colleges.

This test does not apply to [[Universidad Nacional de Colombia]], one of Colombia's main public colleges, because it administers its own test; however, the Universidad Nacional requests the applicants to take test, without regarding the result, in order to consider the application.

The test was originally created in 1966 when the Colombian Association of Universities and the University Fund signed the Agreement number 65. This agreement was reached after a research made by the Colombian Government and members of Colombian Universities.

The test is an intensive one. It is split in two sessions, each one of four hours and thirty minutes. ICFES assigns the schools and schedules throughout the Colombian territory so most of the student body is able to reach nearby schools where to take the test. The organization and logistics related to the test is totally managed by ICFES and different contracts with companies that transport valuables as a way to make the test safely delivered to the students and preventing fraudulent results or illegal copying.

The ICFES is available twice in a year, and students choose at what time they will take it according to the month they are graduating, that can be either in June or December. Usually students that are graduating on June take the exam on March and those who are graduating on December take it on August or July, since 2016. The day of the exam is always a Sunday and it is divided by two sections. During each section students are allowed to go to the restroom once and they have four hours to finish it, and as soon as a student is done, that student can leave the room as long as, more than two hours and a half had passed since the section started.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2859">'''In-home tutoring''' is a form of [[tutoring]] that occurs in the home.  Tutoring is receiving guidance or instruction by a [[tutor]].  Most often the tutoring relates to an academic subject or test preparation.  This is in contrast to tutoring centers or tutoring provided through after-school programs.  The service most often involves one-on-one attention provided to the pupil; otherwise, is called small group tuition, in which the tutor and a small number of pupils gather at one of their homes for tutoring.

==Benefits==
In home tutoring, services dispatch a qualified tutor directly to the client with no need to drive or go  anywhere. Children get an individualized program. Not a predetermined one that all children of that age use, but one that is specifically designed for the child's unique needs. A tutor can address any special needs and work to ensure that the pupil is getting help in those areas that need the most attention. Due to the class size, a pupil may keep his doubt within himself to avoid any embarrassment in front of his classmates. Hence, a pupil would be more open towards his tutor than his school teacher.
In home-based tutoring, we do not need to drive or go anywhere. A tutor can address any special needs and work to ensure that the pupil is getting help in those areas that need the most attention. You can also set your goals and objectives,it improves oral capacity to recite in class, develops capacity to think more with reasonable thoughts, and motivates myself when taking  the exams.

==Criticism==
With the large variety of tutoring companies, a prospective client should be careful when choosing a company. Some companies{{Who|date=December 2012}} use substandard tutors and with little regard to the actual achievement of the pupil. One way to ensure that the student receives the proper training is to get tutored by professionals or students who have gone through the material thoroughly and know what they are doing.

==No Child Left Behind==
In the US, parents can take advantage of the [[No child left behind]] act to qualify for free tutoring for their child.  A company must be registered as a supplementary educational services (SES) provider.  The child must meet state qualifications that often involve attendance of a failing no child left behind school and poor grades.  When the child is qualified, the [[US government]] will pay for the tutoring.

An '''initial sound table''' is a table, list or chart which shows the initial sound letter of a word together with its picture (pictured words). The initial sound table can assist students to recognise initial sounds and to get [[Reading (process)|first reading]] and writing skills. In 1658 [[John Amos Comenius]] created an initial sound table in [[Orbis Pictus]] (a picture book intended for children).

''Alternative names:'' initial sound list, initial sound chart, initial sound [[alphabet]], alphabet chart, alphabet picture chart

== Writing to read ==
In the German-speaking countries, language experience is often based on children's writing of stories that involves [[Whole language|invented spelling]]s (e.g. with the help of an "initial sound table" picturing words that start with a specific sound). The Swiss teacher Jürgen Reichen ([[progressive education]]) founded this "writing to read" method&amp;nbsp;1982. The method combines two basic features of in favour of "[[phonics]]" (unduly equated with "[[direct instruction]]", stepwise teaching, etc.). According to this approach children should be encouraged to "write
words as they pronounce them" with the help of an "initial sound list" of pictured words.
Constructing words in this way is supposed to help them to understand the basic relationship
between spoken and written language.

[[Johann Amos Comenius]] already added 1658 an initial-sound-table to his „[[Orbis sensualium pictus]]“.

== Initial sound keyboard ==
There are software for children which has a multimedial ''initial sound keyboard'' for text input ([[virtual keyboard]]). Several hardware [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] for kids also have ''initial sound pictures'' on its keys. With ''initial sound [[label|stickers]]'' and a standard computer keyboard you can create your own initial sound keyboard.app0l

== Initial sound examples ==
There are [[initial sound]]s, [[medial sound]]s and [[final sound]]s.

'''''Introducing Relativity''''' is a 2002 [[graphic novel|graphic]] [[study guide]] to the [[theory of relativity]] and [[Albert Einstein]] written by Bruce Bassett and illustrated by Ralph Edney. The volume is, according to the publisher's website, "a superlative, fascinating graphic account of Einstein’s strange world," which, "plots a visually accessible course through the thought experiments that have given shape to contemporary physics."&lt;ref name="IB01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Introducing Relativity: A Graphic Guide |first= |last= |url=http://www.introducingbooks.com/title/introducing-relativity/ |work=Icon Books |date= |accessdate=2017-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The authors cover everything from [[time dilation]] to [[black holes]], [[string theory]] to [[dark energy]]," confirms ''[[Sky at Night Magazine]]'' reviewer Professor [[Nigel Henbest]], and, "the going sometimes gets tough."&lt;ref name="SN01"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henbest |first=Nigel |date= |title=Relativity: A Graphic Guide (review) |url=http://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/book/astrophysics/relativity-graphic-guide |journal=[[Sky at Night Magazine]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=2017-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "help is at hand," according to ''[[New Scientist]]'' reviewer [[Marcus Chown]], "to get our heads around stretchy time, shrinking space, black holes, wormholes and the rest."&lt;ref name="NS01"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chown |first=Marcus |date=7 December 2002 |title=Einstein’s rules |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17623726-000-einsteins-rules/ |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=2017-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Marcus Chown]], writing in ''[[New Scientist]]'', describes the volume as, "a very attractive illustrated guide to arguably the greatest ever achievement by a single human mind,"&lt;ref name="NS01" /&gt; which, according to Professor [[Nigel Henbest]], writing in ''[[Sky at Night Magazine]]'', "has all the answers you need."&lt;ref name="SN01" /&gt; Science writer [[Brian Clegg (writer)|Brian Clegg]], author of ''Introducing Infinity'' (2012) in the same series, however finds the book, "good on content, not so good on bringing it down to the right level."&lt;ref name="PS01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Review - Introducing Relativity: A Graphic Guide - Bruce Bassett &amp; Ralph Edney|first=Brian|last=Clegg|url=http://www.popularscience.co.uk/reviews/rev71.htm|work=Popular Science|date=|accessdate=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cosmologist Bruce Bassett and mathematician-cartoonist Ralph Edney are awe-inspiring," according to Henbest, "in their attempts at a popular explanation of one of the most daunting areas of science."&lt;ref name="SN01" /&gt;  Chown states that the "remarkable amount of material," touched on by the writers goes, "from inertia to the theory of inflation; from singularity theorems to superstring theory; from unification to accelerating universes."&lt;ref name="NS01" /&gt; However, Clegg speculates that Bassett's background as a lecturer in cosmology lecturer, "is reflected in the fact there is rather more cosmology in this book than a pure explanation of relativity would require," and in that it, "is much stronger on the theory than the history."&lt;ref name="PS01" /&gt;

"Unfortunately for a book that appears to be aimed at the absolute beginner," states Clegg, "there are parts that are roughly equivalent to material in the first year of a degree course."&lt;ref name="PS01" /&gt; "It helps if you have a passing familiarity with some of the concepts,"&lt;ref name="NS01"/&gt; agrees Chown, and, "you’d probably need A-level physics to absorb all of the concepts fully,"&lt;ref name="SN01" /&gt; confirms Henbest. 

"Overall," concludes Clegg, "it's a noble attempt, with much (much) more meat in it than the companion Introducing Chaos book - but it would need more historical perspective and less inclination to jump to soon into formulae if it were to appeal to its target audience."&lt;ref name="PS01" /&gt; Nonetheless, according to Henbest, "the format means it’s an easy book to dip into, making cutting-edge science available to everyone,"&lt;ref name="SN01" /&gt; and according to Chown, "anyone with an enquiring mind is bound to take away something as they dip in and out of this highly entertaining book."&lt;ref name="NS01"/&gt;

'''John Dewey''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|uː|i}}; October 20, 1859 – June 1, 1952) was an [[American philosopher]], [[psychologist]], and [[Education reform|educational reformer]] whose ideas have been influential in education and social reform. Dewey is one of the primary figures associated with the philosophy of [[pragmatism]] and is considered one of the fathers of [[functional psychology]]. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Dewey as the 93rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=''et al.'' |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–52 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known [[public intellectual]], he was also a major voice of [[progressive education]] and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan, ''John Dewey and the High Tide of American Liberalism'', (1995), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Violas, Paul C. |author2=Tozer, Steven |author3=Senese, Guy B. |title=School and Society: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives |publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages |location= |year= |page=121 |isbn=0-07-298556-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dewey is known best for his publications about education, he also wrote about many other topics, including [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[aesthetics]], [[art]], [[logic]], [[social theory]], and [[ethics]]. He was a major educational reformer for the 20th century.

The overriding theme of Dewey's works was his profound belief in democracy, be it in politics, education, or communication and journalism. As Dewey himself stated in 1888, while still at the University of Michigan, "Democracy and the one, ultimate, ethical ideal of humanity are to my mind synonymous."&lt;ref&gt;''Early Works'', 1:128 (Southern Illinois University Press) op cited in Douglas R. Anderson, AAR, ''The Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', Vol. 61, No. 2 (1993), p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

Known for his advocacy of democracy, Dewey considered two fundamental elements—schools and [[civil society]]—to be major topics needing attention and reconstruction to encourage experimental intelligence and plurality. Dewey asserted that complete democracy was to be obtained not just by extending voting rights but also by ensuring that there exists a fully formed [[public opinion]], accomplished by communication among citizens, experts, and politicians, with the latter being accountable for the policies they adopt.

==Life and works==
John Dewey was born in [[Burlington, Vermont]] to a family of modest means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gutek |first=Gerald L. |title=Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education: A Biographical Introduction. |publisher=Pearson Education Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=0-13-113809-X |page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of four boys born to Archibald Sprague Dewey and Lucina Artemisia Rich Dewey.  Their second son was also named John, but he died in an accident on January 17, 1859.  The second John Dewey was born October 20, 1859, forty weeks after the death of his older brother.  Like his older, surviving brother, [[Davis Rich Dewey]], he attended the [[University of Vermont]], where he was initiated into [[Delta Psi (University of Vermont)|Delta Psi]], and graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_InfoView.aspx?t=&amp;id=59 Who Belongs To Phi Beta Kappa], Phi Beta Kappa website, accessed Oct 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; in 1879. A significant professor of Dewey's at the University of Vermont was [[Henry Augustus Pearson Torrey]] (H. A. P. Torrey), the son-in-law and nephew of former University of Vermont president [[Joseph Torrey]]. Dewey studied privately with Torrey between his graduation from Vermont and his enrollment at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/acs/1890s/dewey/dewey.html bio of Dewey from ''Bowling Green State University''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102195748/http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/acs/1890s/dewey/dewey.html |date=2011-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Menand]], ''The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in the United States''. New York: Farrar, Staus and Giroux, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years as a high-school teacher in [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]] and one teaching elementary school in the small town of [[Charlotte, Vermont]], Dewey decided that he was unsuited as a primary or secondary school teacher. After studying with [[George Sylvester Morris]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Herbert Baxter Adams]], and [[G. Stanley Hall]], Dewey received his Ph.D. from the School of Arts &amp; Sciences at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In 1884, he accepted a faculty position at the [[University of Michigan]] (1884–88 and 1889–94) with the help of George Sylvester Morris. His unpublished and now lost dissertation was titled "The Psychology of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]."

In 1894 Dewey joined the newly founded [[University of Chicago]] (1894–1904) where he developed his belief in Rational [[Empiricism]], becoming associated with the newly emerging Pragmatic philosophy. His time at the University of Chicago resulted in four essays collectively entitled ''[[Thought and its Subject-Matter]]'', which was published with collected works from his colleagues at Chicago under the collective title ''[[Studies in Logical Theory]]'' (1903). During that time Dewey also initiated the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]], where he was able to actualize the pedagogical beliefs that provided material for his first major work on education, ''[[The School and Society]]'' (1899). Disagreements with the administration ultimately caused his resignation from the university, and soon thereafter he relocated near the East Coast. In 1899, Dewey was elected president of the [[American Psychological Association]]. From 1904 until his retirement in 1930 he was professor of philosophy at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''edition of January 19, 1953, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 he became president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. He was a longtime member of the [[American Federation of Teachers]].

Along with the historians [[Charles A. Beard]] and [[James Harvey Robinson]], and the economist [[Thorstein Veblen]], Dewey is one of the founders of [[The New School]]. Dewey's most significant writings were "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" (1896), a critique of a standard psychological concept and the basis of all his further work; ''[[Democracy and Education]]'' (1916), his celebrated work on progressive education; ''[[Human Nature and Conduct]]'' (1922), a study of the function of habit in human behavior;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Dewey|title= Human Nature and Conduct: An Introduction to Social Psychology |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Company |url= https://archive.org/details/humannatureandco011182mbp|year=1922 |accessdate= February 2, 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Public and its Problems]]'' (1927), a defense of democracy written in response to [[Walter Lippmann]]'s ''[[The Phantom Public]]'' (1925); ''[[Experience and Nature]]'' (1925), Dewey's most "metaphysical" statement; ''Impressions of Soviet Russia and the Revolutionary World'' (1929), a glowing travelogue from the nascent [[USSR]];&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey (1929), [http://ariwatch.com/VS/JD/ImpressionsOfSovietRussia.htm ''Impressons of Soviet Russia and the Revolutionary World''], ''The New Republic''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewey1929"&gt;{{citation|author=John Dewey|title=Impressions of Soviet Russia and the Revolutionary World: Mexico — China — Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruAGAAAAMAAJ|year=1929|publisher=''The New Republic''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Art as Experience]]'' (1934), Dewey's major work on aesthetics; ''[[A Common Faith]]'' (1934), a humanistic study of religion originally delivered as the [[Dwight H. Terry Lectureship]] at Yale; ''[[Logic: The Theory of Inquiry]]'' (1938), a statement of Dewey's unusual conception of logic; ''[[Freedom and Culture]]'' (1939), a political work examining the roots of fascism; and ''[[Knowing and the Known]]'' (1949), a book written in conjunction with [[Arthur F. Bentley]] that systematically outlines the concept of trans-action, which is central to his other works (see [[Transactionalism]]). While each of these works focuses on one particular philosophical theme, Dewey included his major themes in most of what he published. He published more than 700 articles in 140 journals, and approximately 40 books.

Reflecting his immense influence on 20th-century thought, [[Hilda Neatby]] wrote "Dewey has been to our age what [[Aristotle]] was to the [[Late Middle Ages|later Middle Ages]], not a philosopher, but ''the'' philosopher."&lt;ref&gt;Hilda M. Neatby, ''So Little for the Mind'' (Toronto: Clarke Irwin &amp; Co. Ltd., 1953), pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey married to Alice Chipman in 1886 shortly after Chipman graduated with her PhB from the University of Michigan. The two had six children: Frederick Archibald Dewey, Evelyn Riggs Dewey, Morris (who died young), Gordon Chipman Dewey, Lucy Alice Chipman Dewey, and Jane Mary Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/dewey.htm Biography at Muskingum College] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331093737/http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/dewey.htm |date=2009-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/women/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/dewey-alice-chipman-1858-1927 from The Dictionary of Women Worldwide: 25,000 Women Through the Ages]&lt;/ref&gt; Alice Chipman died in 1927 at the age of 68; weakened by a case of malaria contracted during a trip to Turkey in 1924 and a heart attack during a trip to Mexico City in 1926, she died from cerebral thrombosis on July 13, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=eandc Douglas J.

The [[United States Postal Service]] honored Dewey with a [[Prominent Americans series]] 30¢ [[postage stamp]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brody|first1=Roger S.|title=30-cent Dewey|url=https://arago.si.edu/category_2028989.html|website=arago.si.edu|publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visits to China and Japan==
[[File:Hu Shih and John Dewey.jpg|thumb|John Dewey and Hu Shih, circa 1938–1942.]]
In 1919, while traveling in Japan on sabbatical leave, Dewey was invited by [[Peking University]] to visit China, probably at the behest of his former students, [[Hu Shih]] and [[Chiang Monlin]]. Dewey and his wife Alice arrived in Shanghai on April 30, 1919,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/31043/31043-h/31043-h.htm Letters from China and Japan by Harriet Alice Chipman Dewey and John Dewey]&lt;/ref&gt; just days before student demonstrators took to the streets of Peking to protest the decision of the Allies in Paris to cede the German held territories in [[Shandong]] province to Japan. Their [[May Fourth Movement|demonstrations on May Fourth]] excited and energized Dewey, and he ended up staying in China for two years, leaving in July 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Ching-Sze Wang. ''John Dewey in China: To Teach and to Learn''. Albany: State University of New York Press, Suny Series in Chinese Philosophy and Culture, 2007. {{ISBN|9780791472033}} pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In these two years, Dewey gave nearly 200 lectures to Chinese audiences and wrote nearly monthly articles for Americans in ''[[The New Republic]]'' and other magazines. Well aware of both Japanese expansionism into China and the attraction of [[Bolshevism]] to some Chinese, Dewey advocated that Americans support China's transformation and that Chinese base this transformation in education and social reforms, not revolution. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of people attended the lectures, which were interpreted by Hu Shih. For these audiences, Dewey represented "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Science," the two personifications which they thought of representing modern values and hailed him as "Second Confucius". Perhaps Dewey's biggest impact, however, was on the forces for progressive education in China, such as Hu Shih and Chiang Monlin, who had studied with him, and [[Tao Xingzhi]], who had studied at Teachers College, Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, pp. 8–10, 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their letters from China and Japan describing their experiences to their family were published in 1920, edited by their daughter Evelyn.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, Harriet Alice Chipman Dewey ''Letters from China and Japan''. New York,: E.P. Dutton, 1920; rpr.

==Visit to Southern Africa==
Dewey and his daughter Jane went to [[South Africa]] in July 1934, at the invitation of the World Conference of New Education Fellowship in [[Cape Town]] and [[Johannesburg]], where he delivered several talks. The conference was opened by the South African Minister of Education [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (1894-1948)|Jan Hofmeyr]], and Deputy Prime Minister [[Jan Smuts]]. Other speakers at the conference included [[Max Eiselen]] and [[Hendrik Verwoerd]], who would later become prime minister of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist]] government that introduced [[Apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraak|first1=Andre|last2=Young|first2=Michael|title=Education in Retrospect: Policy and Implementation since 1990|date=2001|publisher=Human Sciences Research Council, Pretoria|isbn=0-7969-1988-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; John and Jane's expenses were paid by the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]]. He also traveled to [[Durban]], [[Pretoria]] and [[Victoria Falls]] in what was then [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) and looked at schools, talked to pupils, and gave lectures to the administrators and teachers. In August 1934, Dewey accepted an honorary degree from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Jay|title=The Education of John Dewey|date=2002|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231116764|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional psychology==
{{See also|History of psychology}}
At the University of Michigan, Dewey published his first two books, ''Psychology'' (1887), and ''Leibniz's New Essays Concerning the Human Understanding'' (1888), both of which expressed Dewey's early commitment to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|British neo-Hegelianism]]. In ''Psychology'', Dewey attempted a synthesis between idealism and experimental science.&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{Cite book|author=Field, Richard |title=John Dewey in ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' |publisher=Northwest Missouri State University|url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/dewey.htm|accessdate= 29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While still professor of philosophy at Michigan, Dewey and his junior colleagues, [[James Hayden Tufts]] and [[George Herbert Mead]], together with his student [[James Rowland Angell]], all influenced strongly by the recent publication of [[William James]]' ''[[Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890), began to reformulate psychology, emphasizing the social environment on the activity of mind and behavior rather than the physiological psychology of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and his followers.

By 1894, Dewey had joined Tufts, with whom he would later write ''Ethics'' (1908) at the recently founded [[University of Chicago]] and invited Mead and Angell to follow him, the four men forming the basis of the so-called "Chicago group" of psychology.

Their new style of psychology, later dubbed [[functional psychology]], had a practical emphasis on action and application. In Dewey's article "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" which appeared in ''[[Psychological Review]]'' in 1896, he reasons against the traditional [[stimulus-response]] understanding of the [[reflex arc]] in favor of a "circular" account in which what serves as "stimulus" and what as "response" depends on how one considers the situation, and defends the unitary nature of the sensory motor circuit. While he does not deny the existence of stimulus, sensation, and response, he disagreed that they were separate, juxtaposed events happening like links in a chain. He developed the idea that there is a coordination by which the stimulation is enriched by the results of previous experiences. The response is modulated by sensorial experience.

Dewey&lt;!-- , not without polemic, --&gt; was elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1899.
[[File:Timbre USA John Dewey oblW 21101968.jpg|thumb]]
In 1984, the American Psychological Association announced that [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] (1878–1972) had become the first psychologist to be commemorated on a United States postage stamp. However, psychologists Gary Brucato Jr. and [[John D. Hogan]] later made the case that this distinction actually belonged to John Dewey, who had been celebrated on an American stamp 17 years earlier. While some psychology historians consider Dewey more of a philosopher than a bona fide psychologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Benjamin, L.T. | year = 2003 | title = Why Can't Psychology Get a Stamp? | url = | journal = Journal of applied psychoanalytic studies | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 443–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors noted that Dewey was a founding member of the A.P.A., served as the A.P.A.'s eighth president in 1899, and was the author of an 1896 article on the [[reflex arc]] which is now considered a basis of American functional psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Brucato, G. &amp; Hogan, J.D. (1999, Spring). "Psychologists on postage stamps" ''The General Psychologist'', 34(1):65&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey also expressed interest in work in the psychology of [[visual perception]] performed by Dartmouth research professor [[Adelbert Ames Jr.]] He had great trouble with listening, however, because it is known Dewey could not distinguish musical pitches—in other words was [[tone deafness|tone deaf]].&lt;ref&gt;Zeltner, Philip N.; '''John Dewey's Aesthetic Philosophy'''; p. 93 {{ISBN|90-6032-029-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pragmatism, instrumentalism, consequentialism==
Dewey sometimes referred to his philosophy as [[instrumentalism]] rather than [[pragmatism]], and would have recognized the similarity of these two schools to the newer school named [[consequentialism]]. He defined with precise brevity the criterion of validity common to these three schools, which lack agreed-upon definitions:

{{quote|But in the proper interpretation of "pragmatic," namely the function of consequences as necessary tests of the validity of propositions, ''provided'' these consequences are operationally instituted and are such as to resolve the specific problem evoking the operations, the text that follows is thoroughly pragmatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=john|title=Logic: The theory of Inquiry|year=1938|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|location=NY|page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His concern for precise definition led him to detailed analysis of careless word usage, reported in ''Knowing and the Known'' in 1949.

===Epistemology===
{{Main| Knowing and the Known}}
The terminology problem in the fields of epistemology and logic is partially due, according to Dewey and Bentley,&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston]].&lt;/ref&gt; to inefficient and imprecise use of words and concepts that reflect three historic levels of organization and presentation.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston]], pp. 107–09.&lt;/ref&gt; In the order of chronological appearance, these are:
* Self-Action: Prescientific concepts regarded humans, animals, and things as possessing powers of their own which initiated or caused their actions.
* Interaction: as described by Newton, where things, living and inorganic, are balanced against something in a system of interaction, for example, the third law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
* Transaction: where modern systems of descriptions and naming are employed to deal with multiple aspects and phases of action without any attribution to ultimate, final, or independent entities, essences, or realities.

A series of characterizations of [[Transactionalism|Transactions]] indicate the wide range of considerations involved.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, Boston, pp. 121–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic and method==
Dewey sees paradox in contemporary logical theory. Proximate subject matter garners general agreement and advancement, while the ultimate subject matter of logic generates unremitting controversy. In other words, he challenges confident logicians to answer the question of the truth of logical operators. Do they function merely as abstractions (e.g., pure mathematics) or do they connect in some essential way with their objects, and therefore alter or bring them to light?&lt;ref name="logical"&gt;"The Problem of Logical Subject Matter", in ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'' 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Dewey Grave.JPG|thumb|Grave of Dewey and his wife in an alcove on the north side of the [[Ira Allen Chapel]] in [[Burlington, Vermont]]. The only grave on the [[University of Vermont]] campus]]

[[Logical positivism]] also figured in Dewey's thought. About the movement he wrote that it "eschews the use of 'propositions' and 'terms', substituting 'sentences' and 'words'." ("General Theory of Propositions", in ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'') He welcomes this changing of referents "in as far as it fixes attention upon the symbolic structure and content of propositions." However, he registers a small complaint against the use of "sentence" and "words" in that without careful interpretation the act or process of transposition "narrows unduly the scope of symbols and language, since it is not customary to treat gestures and diagrams (maps, blueprints, etc.) as words or sentences."
In other words, sentences and words, considered in isolation, do not disclose intent, which may be inferred or "adjudged only by means of context."&lt;ref name="logical" /&gt;

Yet Dewey was not entirely opposed to modern logical trends. Concerning traditional logic, he states:

{{quote|Aristotelian logic, which still passes current nominally, is a logic based upon the idea that qualitative objects are existential in the fullest sense. To retain logical principles based on this conception along with the acceptance of theories of existence and knowledge based on an opposite conception is not, to say the least, conductive to clearness—a consideration that has a good deal to do with existing dualism between traditional and the newer relational logics.}}

[[Louis Menand]] argues in ''[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America|The Metaphysical Club]]'' that [[Jane Addams]] had been critical of Dewey's emphasis on antagonism in the context of a discussion of the [[Pullman strike]] of 1894. In a later letter to his wife, Dewey confessed that Addams' argument was:

{{quote|... the most magnificent exhibition of intellectual &amp; moral faith I ever saw. She converted me internally, but not really, I fear. ... When you think that Miss Addams does not think this as a philosophy, but believes it in all her senses &amp; muscles—Great God ... I guess I'll have to give it [all] up &amp; start over again.}}

He went on to add:

{{quote|I can see that I have always been interpreting dialectic wrong end up, the unity as the reconciliation of opposites, instead of the opposites as the unity in its growth, and thus translated the physical tension into a moral thing ... I don't know as I give the reality of this at all, ... it seems so natural &amp; commonplace now, but I never had anything take hold of me so.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Menand. ''The Metaphysical Club'' p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a letter to Addams, clearly influenced by his conversation with her, Dewey wrote:

{{quote|Not only is actual antagonizing bad, but the assumption that there is or may be antagonism is bad—in fact, the real first antagonism always comes back to the assumption.}}

===Aesthetics===
{{Main|Art as Experience}}
''Art as Experience'' (1934) is Dewey's major writing on aesthetics.

It is, in accordance with his place in the Pragmatist tradition that emphasizes community, a study of the individual art object as embedded in (and inextricable from) the experiences of a local culture. In the original illustrated edition, Dewey drew on the modern art and world cultures collection assembled by [[Albert C. Barnes]] at the [[Barnes Foundation]], whose own ideas on the application of art to one's way of life was influenced by Dewey's writing. Barnes was particularly influenced by "Democracy and Education" (1916) and then attended Dewey's seminar on political philosophy at Columbia University in the fall semester of 1918.

==On philanthropy, women and democracy==
Dewey founded the University of Chicago [[laboratory school]], supported educational organizations, and supported settlement houses especially [[Jane Addams]]' Hull House.&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stengel|first1=Barbara|title=Dewey's Pragmatic Poet: Reconstructing Jane Addams's Philosophical Impact|journal=Project Muse|pages=29–39|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/.|accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his work at the [[Hull House]] serving on its first board of trustees, Dewey was not only an activist for the cause but also a partner working to serve the large immigrant community of Chicago and women's suffrage. Dewey experienced the lack of children's education while contributing in the classroom at the Hull House and the lack of education and skills of immigrant women.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Upin|first1=Jane S.|title="Charlotte Perkins Gilman": Instrumentalism beyond Dewey:Hypatia|journal=|volume=8|issue=2|pages=38–63|jstor=3810336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stengel argues:

{{quote|Addams is unquestionably a maker of democratic community and pragmatic education; Dewey is just as unquestionably a reflector. Through her work at Hull House, Addams discerned the shape of democracy as a mode of associated living and uncovered the outlines of an experimental approach to knowledge and understanding; Dewey analyzed and classified the social, psychological and educational processes Addams lived.&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stengel|first1=Barbara|title=Dewey's Pragmatic Poet: Reconstructing Jane Addams's Philosophical Impact|journal=Project Muse|pages=29–39|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/.|accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His leading views on democracy included: "First, Dewey believed that democracy is an ethical ideal rather than merely a political arrangement. Second, he considered participation, not representation, the essence of democracy. Third, he insisted on the harmony between democracy and the scientific method: ever-expanding and self-critical communities of inquiry, operating on pragmatic principles and constantly revising their beliefs in light of new evidence, provided Dewey with a model for democratic decision making ... Finally, Dewey called for extending democracy, conceived as an ethical project, from politics to industry and society".&lt;ref name="John Dewey and American Democracy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Westbrook|first1=Robert B.|title=John Dewey and American Democracy|journal=|volume=97|issue=3|pages=919–20|jstor=2164912}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped to shape his understanding of human action and the unity of human experience.

Dewey believed that a woman's place in society was determined by her environment and not just her biology. On women he says, "You think too much of women in terms of sex. Think of them as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won't be so sure of some of your generalizations about what they should and shouldn't do".&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; John Dewey's support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams' Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew as well as the support for the women's suffrage movement.

As commonly argued by Dewey's greatest critics, he was not able to come up with strategies in order to fulfill his ideas that would lead to a successful democracy, educational system, and a successful women's suffrage movement. While knowing that traditional beliefs, customs, and practices needed to be examined in order to find out what worked and what needed improved upon, it was never done in a systematic way.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; "Dewey became increasingly aware of the obstacles presented by entrenched power and alert to the intricacy of the problems facing modern cultures".&lt;ref name="John Dewey and American Democracy"/&gt; With the complex of society at the time, Dewey was criticized for his lack of effort in fixing the problems.

With respect to technological developments in a democracy:

{{quote|Persons do not become a society by living in physical proximity any more than a man ceases to be socially influenced by being so many feet or miles removed from others.}}

His work on democracy influenced [[B.R. Ambedkar]], one of his students, who later became one of the founding fathers of independent India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambedkar|first=Bhimrao|title=Annihilation of castes|publisher=Critical Quest|isbn=81-89524-21-6|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|title=Ambedkar's teacher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2017/05/john-dewey-pragmatism-communication-and-bhimrao-ambedkar/|title=The like-mindedness of Dewey and Ambedkar|date=2017-05-19|work=Forward Press|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2018/01/ambedkars-pragmatism-drew-heavily-on-the-1908-ethics/|title=Ambedkar’s pragmatism drew heavily on the 1908 ‘Ethics’|date=2018-01-05|work=Forward Press|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On education and teacher education==
{{Main| Democracy and Education}}
{{Education in the U.S.}}
Dewey's educational theories were presented in ''My Pedagogic Creed'' (1897), ''The School and Society'' (1900), ''The Child and the Curriculum'' (1902), ''[[Democracy and Education]]'' (1916), [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001117418 ''Schools of To-morrow'' ] (c1915) with Evelyn Dewey, and ''[[Experience and Education (book)|Experience and Education]]'' (1938). Several themes recur throughout these writings. Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform can and should take place. In addition, he believed that students thrive in an environment where they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning.

The ideas of democracy and social reform are continually discussed in Dewey's writings on education. Dewey makes a strong case for the importance of education not only as a place to gain content knowledge, but also as a place to learn how to live. In his eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a pre-determined set of skills, but rather the realization of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. He notes that "to prepare him for the future life means to give him command of himself; it means so to train him that he will have the full and ready use of all his capacities" (''My Pedagogic Creed'', Dewey, 1897). In addition to helping students realize their full potential, Dewey goes on to acknowledge that education and schooling are instrumental in creating social change and reform. He notes that "education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction".

In addition to his ideas regarding what education is and what effect it should have on society, Dewey also had specific notions regarding how education should take place within the classroom. In ''The Child and the Curriculum'' (1902), Dewey discusses two major conflicting schools of thought regarding educational pedagogy. The first is centered on the curriculum and focuses almost solely on the subject matter to be taught. Dewey argues that the major flaw in this methodology is the inactivity of the student; within this particular framework, "the child is simply the immature being who is to be matured; he is the superficial being who is to be deepened" (1902, p.&amp;nbsp;13).&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1902). ''The child and the curriculum''. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that in order for education to be most effective, content must be presented in a way that allows the student to relate the information to prior experiences, thus deepening the connection with this new knowledge.

At the same time, Dewey was alarmed by many of the "child-centered" excesses of educational-school pedagogues who claimed to be his followers, and he argued that too much reliance on the child could be equally detrimental to the learning process. In this second school of thought, "we must take our stand with the child and our departure from him. It is he and not the subject-matter which determines both quality and quantity of learning" (Dewey, 1902, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–14). According to Dewey, the potential flaw in this line of thinking is that it minimizes the importance of the content as well as the role of the teacher.

In order to rectify this dilemma, Dewey advocated for an educational structure that strikes a balance between delivering knowledge while also taking into account the interests and experiences of the student. He notes that "the child and the curriculum are simply two limits which define a single process. Just as two points define a straight line, so the present standpoint of the child and the facts and truths of studies define instruction" (Dewey, 1902, p.&amp;nbsp;16). It is through this reasoning that Dewey became one of the most famous proponents of [[hands-on learning]] or [[experiential education]], which is related to, but not synonymous with [[experiential learning]]. He argued that "if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind" (Dewey, 1916/2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;217–18).&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (2009). ''Democracy and education: An introduction to the philosophy of education''. New York: WLC Books. (Original work published 1916)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey's ideas went on to influence many other influential experiential models and advocates. [[Problem-Based Learning]] (PBL), for example, a method used widely in education today, incorporates Dewey's ideas pertaining to learning through active inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Savery, J. R. (2006). Overview of Problem-based Learning: Definitions and Distinctions. ''Journal of Problem-based
Learning'', 1(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. Throughout the history of American schooling, education's purpose has been to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. The works of John Dewey provide the most prolific examples of how this limited vocational view of education has been applied to both the K–12 public education system and to the teacher training schools who attempted to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline-specific skills needed to meet the needs of the employer and demands of the workforce. In ''The School and Society'' (Dewey, 1899) and ''Democracy of Education'' (Dewey, 1916), Dewey claims that rather than preparing citizens for ethical participation in society, schools cultivate passive pupils via insistence upon mastery of facts and disciplining of bodies. Rather than preparing students to be reflective, autonomous and ethical beings capable of arriving at social truths through critical and intersubjective discourse, schools prepare students for docile compliance with authoritarian work and political structures, discourage the pursuit of individual and communal inquiry, and perceive higher learning as a monopoly of the institution of education (Dewey, 1899; 1916).

For Dewey and his philosophical followers, education stifles individual autonomy when learners are taught that knowledge is transmitted in one direction, from the expert to the learner. Dewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. For Dewey, "The thing needful is improvement of education, not simply by turning out teachers who can do better the things that are not necessary to do, but rather by changing the conception of what constitutes education" (Dewey, 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;18). Dewey's qualifications for teaching—a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which "work automatically, unconsciously" (Dewey, 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;15). Turning to Dewey's essays and public addresses regarding the teaching profession, followed by his analysis of the teacher as a person and a professional, as well as his beliefs regarding the responsibilities of teacher education programs to cultivate the attributes addressed, teacher educators can begin to reimagine the successful classroom teacher Dewey envisioned.

===Professionalization of teaching as a social service===
For many, education's purpose is to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. As Dewey notes, this limited vocational view is also applied to teacher training schools who attempt to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline skills needed to meet the needs of the employer and demands of the workforce (Dewey, 1904). For Dewey, the school and the classroom teacher, as a workforce and provider of a social service, have a unique responsibility to produce psychological and social goods that will lead to both present and future social progress. As Dewey notes, "The business of the teacher is to produce a higher standard of intelligence in the community, and the object of the public school system is to make as large as possible the number of those who possess this intelligence. Skill, ability to act wisely and effectively in a great variety of occupations and situations, is a sign and a criterion of the degree of civilization that a society has reached. It is the business of teachers to help in producing the many kinds of skill needed in contemporary life. If teachers are up to their work, they also aid in the production of character."(Dewey, TAP, 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;241–42).

According to Dewey, the emphasis is placed on producing these attributes in children for use in their contemporary life because it is "impossible to foretell definitely just what civilization will be twenty years from now" (Dewey, MPC, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;25). However, although Dewey is steadfast in his beliefs that education serves an immediate purpose (Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010), he is not ignorant of the impact imparting these qualities of intelligence, skill, and character on young children in their present life will have on the future society. While addressing the state of educative and economic affairs during a 1935 radio broadcast, Dewey linked the ensuing economic depression to a "lack of sufficient production of intelligence, skill, and character" (Dewey, TAP, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;242) of the nation's workforce. As Dewey notes, there is a lack of these goods in the present society and teachers have a responsibility to create them in their students, who, we can assume, will grow into the adults who will ultimately go on to participate in whatever industrial or economical civilization awaits them. According to Dewey, the profession of the classroom teacher is to produce the intelligence, skill, and character within each student so that the democratic community is composed of citizens who can think, do and act intelligently and morally.

===A teacher's knowledge===
Dewey believed that the successful classroom teacher possesses a passion for knowledge and an intellectual curiosity in the materials and methods they teach. For Dewey, this propensity is an inherent curiosity and love for learning that differs from one's ability to acquire, recite and reproduce textbook knowledge. "No one," according to Dewey, "can be really successful in performing the duties and meeting these demands [of teaching] who does not retain [her] intellectual curiosity intact throughout [her] entire career" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;34). According to Dewey, it is not that the "teacher ought to strive to be a high-class scholar in all the subjects he or she has to teach," rather, "a teacher ought to have an unusual love and aptitude in some one subject: history, mathematics, literature, science, a fine art, or whatever" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;35). The classroom teacher does not have to be a scholar in all subjects; rather, a genuine love in one will elicit a feel for genuine information and insight in all subjects taught.

In addition to this propensity for study into the subjects taught, the classroom teacher "is possessed by a recognition of the responsibility for the constant study of school room work, the constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils" (Dewey, PST, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;37). For Dewey, this desire for the lifelong pursuit of learning is inherent in other professions (e.g. the architectural, legal and medical fields; Dewey, 1904 &amp; Dewey, PST, 2010), and has particular importance for the field of teaching. As Dewey notes, "this further study is not a side line but something which fits directly into the demands and opportunities of the vocation" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;34).

According to Dewey, this propensity and passion for intellectual growth in the profession must be accompanied by a natural desire to communicate one's knowledge with others. "There are scholars who have [the knowledge] in a marked degree but who lack enthusiasm for imparting it. To the 'natural born' teacher learning is incomplete unless it is shared" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;35). For Dewey, it is not enough for the classroom teacher to be a lifelong learner of the techniques and subject-matter of education; she must aspire to share what she knows with others in her learning community.

===A teacher's skill===
The best indicator of teacher quality, according to Dewey, is the ability to watch and respond to the movement of the mind with keen awareness of the signs and quality of the responses he or her students exhibit with regard to the subject-matter presented (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, 1904). As Dewey notes, "I have often been asked how it was that some teachers who have never studied the art of teaching are still extraordinarily good teachers. The explanation is simple. They have a quick, sure and unflagging sympathy with the operations and process of the minds they are in contact with. Their own minds move in harmony with those of others, appreciating their difficulties, entering into their problems, sharing their intellectual victories" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;36). Such a teacher is genuinely aware of the complexities of this mind to mind transfer, and she has the intellectual fortitude to identify the successes and failures of this process, as well as how to appropriately reproduce or correct it in the future.

===A teacher's disposition===
As a result of the direct influence teachers have in shaping the mental, moral and spiritual lives of children during their most formative years, Dewey holds the profession of teaching in high esteem, often equating its social value to that of the ministry and to parenting (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, PST, 2010; Dewey, TTC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010). Perhaps the most important attributes, according to Dewey, are those personal inherent qualities which the teacher brings to the classroom. As Dewey notes, "no amount of learning or even of acquired pedagogical skill makes up for the deficiency" (Dewey, TLS, p.&amp;nbsp;25) of the personal traits needed to be most successful in the profession.

According to Dewey, the successful classroom teacher occupies an indispensable passion for promoting the intellectual growth of young children. In addition, they know that their career, in comparison to other professions, entails stressful situations, long hours and limited financial reward; all of which have the potential to overcome their genuine love and sympathy for their students. For Dewey, "One of the most depressing phases of the vocation is the number of care worn teachers one sees, with anxiety depicted on the lines of their faces, reflected in their strained high pitched voices and sharp manners. While contact with the young is a privilege for some temperaments, it is a tax on others, and a tax which they do not bear up under very well. And in some schools, there are too many pupils to a teacher, too many subjects to teach, and adjustments to pupils are made in a mechanical rather than a human way. Human nature reacts against such unnatural conditions" (Dewey, APT, 2101, p.&amp;nbsp;35).

It is essential, according to Dewey, that the classroom teacher has the mental propensity to overcome the demands and stressors placed on them because the students can sense when their teacher is not genuinely invested in promoting their learning (Dewey, PST, 2010). Such negative demeanors, according to Dewey, prevent children from pursuing their own propensities for learning and intellectual growth. It can therefore be assumed that if teachers want their students to engage with the educational process and employ their natural curiosities for knowledge, teachers must be aware of how their reactions to young children and the stresses of teaching influence this process.

===The role of teacher education to cultivate the professional classroom teacher===
Dewey's passions for teaching—a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which "work automatically, unconsciously" (Dewey, 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;15). According to Dewey, teacher education programs must turn away from focusing on producing proficient practitioners because such practical skills related to instruction and discipline (e.g. creating and delivering lesson plans, classroom management, implementation of an assortment of content-specific methods) can be learned over time during their everyday school work with their students (Dewey, PST, 2010). As Dewey notes, "The teacher who leaves the professional school with power in managing a class of children may appear to superior advantage the first day, the first week, the first month, or even the first year, as compared with some other teacher who has a much more vital command of the psychology, logic and ethics of development. But later 'progress' may with such consist only in perfecting and refining skill already possessed. Such persons seem to know how to teach, but they are not students of teaching. Even though they go on studying books of pedagogy, reading teachers' journals, attending teachers' institutes, etc., yet the root of the matter is not in them, unless they continue to be students of subject-matter, and students of mind-activity. Unless a teacher is such a student, he may continue to improve in the mechanics of school management, but he cannot grow as a teacher, an inspirer and director of soul-life" (Dewey, 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;15). For Dewey, teacher education should focus not on producing persons who know how to teach as soon as they leave the program; rather, teacher education should be concerned with producing professional students of education who have the propensity to inquire about the subjects they teach, the methods used, and the activity of the mind as it gives and receives knowledge. According to Dewey, such a student is not superficially engaging with these materials, rather, the professional student of education has a genuine passion to inquire about the subjects of education, knowing that doing so ultimately leads to acquisitions of the skills related to teaching. Such students of education aspire for the intellectual growth within the profession that can only be achieved by immersing one's self in the lifelong pursuit of the intelligence, skills and character Dewey linked to the profession.

As Dewey notes, other professional fields, such as law and medicine cultivate a professional spirit in their fields to constantly study their work, their methods of their work, and a perpetual need for intellectual growth and concern for issues related to their profession. Teacher education, as a profession, has these same obligations (Dewey, 1904; Dewey, PST, 2010). As Dewey notes, "An intellectual responsibility has got to be distributed to every human being who is concerned in carrying out the work in question, and to attempt to concentrate intellectual responsibility for a work that has to be done, with their brains and their hearts, by hundreds or thousands of people in a dozen or so at the top, no matter how wise and skillful they are, is not to concentrate responsibility—it is to diffuse irresponsibility" (Dewey, PST, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;39). For Dewey, the professional spirit of teacher education requires of its students a constant study of school room work, constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils. Such study will lead to professional enlightenment with regard to the daily operations of classroom teaching.

As well as his very active and direct involvement in setting up educational institutions such as the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]] (1896) and [[The New School for Social Research]] (1919), many of Dewey's ideas influenced the founding of [[Bennington College]] and Goddard College in Vermont, where he served on the Board of Trustees. Dewey's works and philosophy also held great influence in the creation of the short-lived [[Black Mountain College]] in North Carolina, an experimental college focused on interdisciplinary study, and whose faculty included [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Charles Olson]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], [[Robert Creeley]], and [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], among others. Black Mountain College was the locus of the "Black Mountain Poets" a group of avant-garde poets closely linked with the [[Beat Generation]] and the [[San Francisco Renaissance]].

==On journalism==
{{Main| The Public and its Problems}}
[[File:John Dewey caricat.jpg|thumb|Caricature of Dewey by André Koehne, 2006]]
Since the mid-1980s, Deweyan ideas have experienced revival as a major source of inspiration for the public journalism movement. Dewey's definition of "public," as described in ''[[The Public and its Problems]]'', has profound implications for the significance of journalism in society. As suggested by the title of the book, his concern was of the transactional relationship between publics and problems. Also implicit in its name, public journalism seeks to orient communication away from elite, corporate hegemony toward a civic public sphere. "The 'public' of public journalists is Dewey's public."

Dewey gives a concrete definition to the formation of a public. Publics are spontaneous groups of citizens who share the indirect effects of a particular action. Anyone affected by the indirect consequences of a specific action will automatically share a common interest in controlling those consequences, i.e., solving a common problem.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. 1927. ''The Public and its Problems''. Henry Holt &amp; Co., New York. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Since every action generates [[unintended consequence]]s, publics continuously emerge, overlap, and disintegrate.

In ''The Public and its Problems'', Dewey presents a rebuttal to [[Walter Lippmann]]'s treatise on the role of journalism in democracy. Lippmann's model was a basic transmission model in which journalists took information given to them by experts and elites, repackaged that information in simple terms, and transmitted the information to the public, whose role was to react emotionally to the news. In his model, Lippmann supposed that the public was incapable of thought or action, and that all thought and action should be left to the experts and elites.

Dewey refutes this model by assuming that politics is the work and duty of each individual in the course of his daily routine. The knowledge needed to be involved in politics, in this model, was to be generated by the interaction of citizens, elites, experts, through the mediation and facilitation of journalism. In this model, not just the government is accountable, but the citizens, experts, and other actors as well.

Dewey also said that journalism should conform to this ideal by changing its emphasis from actions or happenings (choosing a winner of a given situation) to alternatives, choices, consequences, and [[Condition (philosophy)|conditions]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]] . Conditions and Consequences. American Philosophy: an Encyclopedia. 2007. Eds. John Lachs and Robert Talisse. New York: Routledge. pp. 124–27.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to foster conversation and improve the generation of knowledge. Journalism would not just produce a static product that told what had already happened, but the news would be in a constant state of evolution as the public added value by generating knowledge. The "audience" would end, to be replaced by citizens and collaborators who would essentially be users, doing more with the news than simply reading it. Concerning his effort to change journalism, he wrote in ''The Public and Its Problems'': "Till the Great Society is converted in to a Great Community, the Public will remain in eclipse. Communication can alone create a great community" (Dewey, p.&amp;nbsp;142).

Dewey believed that communication creates a great community, and citizens who participate actively with public life contribute to that community. "The clear consciousness of a communal life, in all its implications, constitutes the idea of democracy." (''The Public and its Problems'', p.&amp;nbsp;149). This Great Community can only occur with "free and full intercommunication." (p.&amp;nbsp;211) Communication can be understood as journalism.

==On humanism==
As an atheist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dewey at One Hundred Fifty|year=2009|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=9781557535504|page=22|authorlink=Larry A. Hickman|editor1=A. G. Rud |editor2=Jim Garrison |editor3=Lynda Stone |quote=With respect to his personal beliefs, Dewey wrote to Max Otto that "I feel the gods are pretty dead, tho I suppose I ought to know that however, to be somewhat more philosophical in the matter, if atheism means simply not being a theist, then of course I'm an atheist. But the popular if not the etymological significance of the word is much wider. ... Although he described himself as an atheist in one sense of the term, it is also clear that Dewey was opposed to militant atheism for the same reason that he was opposed to supernaturalism: he thought both positions dogmatic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] in his later life, Dewey participated with a variety of humanistic activities from the 1930s into the 1950s, which included sitting on the advisory board of [[Charles Francis Potter]]'s [[First Humanist Society of New York]] (1929); being one of the original 34 signatories of the first ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' (1933) and being elected an honorary member of the Humanist Press Association (1936).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030608113016/http://www.siu.edu/%7Edeweyctr/CHRONO.pdf "John Dewey Chronology" 1934.04.08, 1936.03.12, 1940.09, and 1950.09.11.]&lt;/ref&gt;

His opinion of humanism is summarized in his own words from an article titled "What Humanism Means to Me", published in the June 1930 edition of ''Thinker 2'':

{{quote|What Humanism means to me is an expansion, not a contraction, of human life, ''an expansion in which nature and the science of nature are made the willing servants of human good''.&lt;ref&gt;"What Humanism Means to Me," first published in ''Thinker 2'' (June 1930): 9–12, as part of a series. Dewey: p. lw.5.266 [''The Collected Works of John Dewey, 1882–1953'', The Electronic Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Social and political activism==
{{American socialism}}
As a major advocate for academic freedom, in 1935 Dewey, together with [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Alvin Saunders Johnson|Alvin Johnson]], became a member of the United States section of the International League for Academic Freedom,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/public3_text.htm American Institute of Physics]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1940, together with [[Horace M Kallen]], edited a series of articles related to the [[The Bertrand Russell Case|Bertrand Russell Case]].

As well as being active in defending the independence of teachers, and opposing a communist takeover of the New York Teachers' Union,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Dewey was involved in the organization that eventually became the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

He was an avid supporter of [[Henry George]]'s proposal for taxing land values. Of George, he wrote, "No man, no graduate of a higher educational institution, has a right to regard himself as an educated man in social thought unless he has some first-hand acquaintance with the theoretical contribution of this great American thinker."&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1927) [http://www.wealthandwant.com/HG/PP/Dewey_Appreciation_HG.html An Appreciation of Henry George]&lt;/ref&gt; As honorary president of the Henry George School of Social Science, he wrote a letter to [[Henry Ford]] urging him to support the school.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1939) [http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/dewey-john_a-letter-to-henry-ford-1939.html A Letter to Henry Ford] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113025951/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/dewey-john_a-letter-to-henry-ford-1939.html |date=2015-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He directed the famous [[Dewey Commission]] held in Mexico in 1937, which cleared [[Leon Trotsky]] of the charges made against him by [[Joseph Stalin]],&lt;ref name="Dewey Commission Report"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1937/dewey/index.htm "Dewey Commission Report"]&lt;/ref&gt; and marched for women's rights, among many other causes.

In 1939, John Dewey was elected President of the [[League for Industrial Democracy]], an organization with the goal of educating college students about the labor movement. The Student Branch of the L.I.D. would later become [[Students for a Democratic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Dewey'', edited by Molly Cochran. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Dewey, [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Benedetto Croce]], [[Karl Jaspers]], and [[Jacques Maritain]] agreed to act as honorary chairmen of the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v38i5a10p.htm "Origins of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, 1949–1950" CIA official web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613054254/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v38i5a10p.htm |date=2007-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Front organizations|false-front]] anti-communist advocacy group founded that year and funded by the [[CIA]].

==Other interests==
Dewey's interests and writings included many topics, and according to the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], "a substantial part of his published output consisted of commentary on current domestic and international politics, and public statements on behalf of many causes. (He is probably the only philosopher in this encyclopedia to have published both on the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and on the value of displaying art in post offices.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seop.leeds.ac.uk/archives/sum2005/entries/dewey-political/ "Dewey's Political Philosophy" Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, Dewey met [[F. Matthias Alexander|F. M. Alexander]] in New York City and later wrote introductions to Alexander's ''Man's Supreme Inheritance'' (1918), ''Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual'' (1923) and ''The Use of the Self'' (1932). Alexander's influence is referenced in "Human Nature and Conduct" and "Experience and Nature."&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Alexander ''Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual'', E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1923 {{ISBN|0-913111-11-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as his contacts with people mentioned elsewhere in the article, he also maintained correspondence with [[Henri Bergson]], [[William M. Brown]], [[Martin Buber]], [[George Counts|George S. Counts]], [[William Rainey Harper]], [[Sidney Hook]], and [[George Santayana]].

==Criticism==
Dewey is considered the epitome of liberalism by historians,&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan, ''John Dewey and the high tide of American liberalism''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Paringer, ''John Dewey and the paradox of liberal reform'' (1990) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes was portrayed as "dangerously radical."&lt;ref&gt;William R. Caspary, ''Dewey on Democracy''. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Dewey was critiqued strongly by American communists because he argued against [[Stalinism]] and had philosophical differences with Marx, identifying himself as a democratic socialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Westbrook | first = Robert B | title = John Dewey and American Democracy | publisher = Cornell University Press | year = 1993 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-8014-8111-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have examined his religious beliefs. Biographer [[Steven C. Rockefeller]] traced Dewey's democratic convictions to his childhood attendance at the [[Congregational Church]], with its strong proclamation of social ideals and the [[Social Gospel]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Rockefeller, ''John Dewey: Religious Faith and Democratic Humanism'', (1994), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Edward A. White suggested in ''[[Science and Religion in American Thought]]'' (1952) that Dewey's work led to the 20th century rift between religion and science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44088">The [[Victoria Cross]] has been awarded 1,358 times to persons of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/victoriacross.asp |title=Victoria Cross registers 1856-1944 |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list only shows a minor proportion. More than 900 VC winners have no school recorded, and some never attended school (primary school was not compulsory in the UK until the 1870s and secondary education only sometime later), so many private soldiers who were awarded the Victoria Cross in the past may never have gone to school or never gone to secondary school. (see [[British Army during the Victorian Era]]).

== Officers and NCOs are overweighted in VCs==
"Although the terms of the creation of the VC emphasised that it was open to both services and to all ranks, it is clear that there is a numerical bias towards officers and NCOs".&lt;ref&gt;Images of the army: the military in British art, 1815-1914 By Joan Winifred Martin Hichberger&lt;/ref&gt; Clause 13 of the warrant explains that in the "event of a gallant and daring act having been performed" ... "one officer shall be selected by the officers engaged for the Decoration, and in like manner one petty officer or non-commissioned officer".&lt;ref&gt;Original Warrant, Clause 13: Thirteenthly. It is ordained that in the event of a gallant and daring act having been performed by a squadron, ship's company, or detached body of seamen and marines not under fifty in number, or by a brigade, regiment, troop or company in which the admiral, general, or other officer commanding such forces may deem that all are equally brave and distinguished, and that no special selection can be made by them, then is such case the admiral, general, or other officer commanding, may direct that for any such body of seamen or marines, or for every troop or company of soldiers, one officer shall be selected by the officers engaged for the Decoration, and in like manner one petty officer or non-commissioned officer shall be selected by the petty officers and non-commissioned officers engaged, and two seamen or private soldiers or marines shall be selected by the seamen or private soldiers, or marines engaged, respectively for the Decoration, and the names of those selected shall be transmitted by the senior officers in command of the Naval force, brigade, regiment, troop, or company, to the admiral or general officer commanding, who shall in due manner confer the Decoration as if the acts were done under his own eye.&lt;/ref&gt;

== VC and Bar winners ==
Three people have been awarded the Victoria Cross and Bar, [[Christ's College, Christchurch|Christ's College, Christchurch, New Zealand]] ([[Charles Upham]]), [[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]]/[[Liverpool College]] ([[Noel Godfrey Chavasse]]) and [[Westminster School]] ([[Arthur Martin-Leake]]). The bars are included as separate awards in the columns of the table.

==Victoria Crosses by school and campaign==
The statistics have accuracy issues because
* some recipients have gone to multiple schools. 
* only a small number of non-British countries are included (2 of 29 Indians).
* Many VCs winners are missing.

The order of the schools is based on the school name due to the missing VCs.

==Overview==
The idea of [[action research]] as a living practice entered the mainstream of action research from the book, "Action Research as a Living Practice" by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. Carson and Sumara transformed the concept of traditional action research with the idea that, ..." participation in action research practices are particular ways of living and understanding that require more of the researcher than the "application" of research methods. Rather, action research is a lived practice that requires that the researcher not only investigate the subject at hand but, as well, provide some account of the way in which the investigation both shapes and is shaped by the investigator {{harv|Carson|Sumara|1997| p=xii}}. This requires what [[Martin Buber]] called an "[[I and Thou|I-Thou]]" approach toward other and this approach applied to action research as well. To make Buber's language more modern and accessible, LET translated Buber's "I-Thou" approach toward another human being to an "I/you/we" approach to action research. This differs greatly from an approach to living theory action research imagined by Jack Whitehead (2002){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} where he imagines living theory action research as forming an "I-theory" of knowledge. Director of the [[Philosophy for Children]] Project at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] William Barry proposes LET focuses on the connections between the researcher and the other person or subject where the lives of action researchers are inextricable linked in a profound manner with the individuals and communities involved in the subject of study. LET from a Barryian perspective is a [[critical theory]] and [[emancipation|emancipatory]] action research approach which seeks the dialectic, not debate and battles of [discourse].

A major difference of William Barry's version of living educational theory, which was the focus of his successful completion of a Ph.D. thesis at [[Nottingham Trent University]], UK, is the essential question behind the living educational theory approach to action research ([[#{{harvid|Barry|2012b}}|2012b]]). The question is not "How can I generate a living legacy for myself through an I-It theory approach toward knowledge and other forms of life?" Rather the essential question is, "How does one conduct a life that includes the practice of educational action research?"{{harv|Carson|Sumara|1997| p=xvii}} The theory/practice problem disappears when honesty about one's biases regarding spiritual, existential, and emotional intelligence are made clear in the action research process.

The phraseology "educational theory" originated with the work of [[Jack Whitehead]], a former lecturer at the [[University of Bath]], and it was further developed and greatly improved methodologically by [[Jean McNiff]] in 2009 because of her willingness to be transparent about her values and intentions. Whitehead's main emphasis for conducting research is to promote the individual under the guise of collaboration and research outcomes must be captured on video for authentic validation. Whitehead's view of action research promotes that living educational theory (he uses living theory and living educational theory interchangeably so it is difficult for a reader to know what he is writing about) should be aimed at the bringing of energy-flowing values as explanatory principles and standards of judgments into the Academy for the legitimation of living educational theories (Whitehead 2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. In the eyes of Whitehead [[radical constructivism]] is at the core of living educational theory research. In 2013, Whitehead and McNiff separated as collaborators as McNiff saw spiritual, emotional intelligence as key to action research while Whitehead disagreed and believed that media accounts (primarily video tapping people) of action research could provide clues to virtues which held the future of humanity though energy flowing examples of collaboration. McNiff stated in a May 2013 conference she San Francisco, California (ARNA Conference){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} that she would never appear or work with Whitehead again. She repeated this message again months later at a UK conference in York. American  William Barry believed the concept of LET was too important and found a dialectic between McNiff and Whitehead and he created a new understanding of LET which was presented at a three-day international conference in 2013 at [[Liverpool Hope University]] titled, "Researching Our Own Practice" {{harv|Barry|2013}}.

== Definition ==

Living educational theory was first clearly defined and developed by California Professor of Philosophy [[William Barry (educator)|William Barry]] (2012b) in [[Liz Atkins]] and [[Susan Wallace (educator)|Susan Wallace]]'s book {{harv|Atkins|Wallace|2012}}, ''Qualitative Research in Education'', co-published by [[Sage Publications|Sage]] and the [[British Educational Research Association]] (BERA). This book was one of four in a series sponsored by the BERA regarding best practice progressive research methods in educational research. The originality and uniqueness of Barry's development of living educational theory (LET) action research is the importance of gaining ''ontological weight'' through the action research process. Ontological weight empowers the researcher's ability, and the ability of other people involved in the action research project, to have the research experience and focus of the research be transformational and add, or at least reinforce, a sense of meaning in learning and life. Barry was influenced to use the concept "ontological weight" by the existentialist Catholic philosopher [[Gabriel Marcel]] (1963).{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The idea of action research as a living practice entered the mainstream of action research from the book, "Action Research as a Living Practice" by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. The term "educational theory" originated with the work of [[Jack Whitehead]], a former lecturer at the [[University of Bath]], and it was further developed and greatly improved methodologically by [[Jean McNiff]] in 2009.{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} Whitehead's main emphasis for conducting research is to promote the individual under the guise of collaboration and research outcomes must be captured on video for authentic validation. Whitehead's view of action research promotes that living educational theory (he uses living theory and living educational theory interchangeably so it is difficult for a reader to know what he is writing about) should be aimed at the bringing of energy-flowing values as explanatory principles and standards of judgments into the Academy for the legitimation of living educational theories (Whitehead 2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. In the eyes of Whitehead, [[radical constructivism]] is at the core of living educational theory research.

Barry was asked by the BERA sponsored authors to reflect on the nature of living educational theory (LET) because there existed no clear definition of LET in the literature. Barry was asked because he had successfully used LET in an innovative fashion, and was the first to clearly define LET as based in [[critical theory]] {{harv|Wink|2011}} which embraced [[transpersonal psychology]] through his earned 2012 PhD thesis at [[Nottingham Trent University]] Nottingham, UK. He proposed LET as a way of challenging the oppressive use of power using critical theory {{harv|Gorlewski|Gorlewski|Portfilio|2012}} in a need fulfilling way (Glasser 1998){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. Barry proposed the following definition and approach to action research he calls living educational theory and his approach has been used as an action research method in undergraduate and graduate courses and research at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] in Silicon Valley, California as well as by other researchers around the world.

Barry explained that living educational theory "[is] a critical and transformational approach to action research. It confronts the researcher to challenge the status quo of their educational practice and to answer the question, 'How can I improve that I'm doing?' Researchers who use this approach must be willing to recognize and assume responsibility for being a 'living contradiction' in their professional practice – thinking one way and acting in another. The mission of the LET action researcher is to overcome workplace norms and self – behavior which contradict the researcher's values and beliefs. The vision of the LET researcher is to make an original contribution to knowledge through generating an educational theory proven to improve the learning of people within a social learning space. The standard of judgment for theory validity is evidence of workplace reform, transformational growth of the researcher, and improved learning by the people researcher claimed to have influenced..." {{harv|Atkins|Wallace|2012| p=131}}.

Barry's LET approach to action research was heavily influenced by action researchers focused on emancipatory social change, collaboration, and liberation theology ([[#{{harvid|Barry|2012a}}|2012a]]). Prominent developers of LET, without whose work LET would most likely never had been developed by Barry, are notable action researchers, educators, and philosophers such as [[Martin Buber]]'s ([[#{{harvid|Buber|1970}}|1970]]) conception of 'I and Thou' and [[Krishnamurti]]'s (1953){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} liberation pedagogy emphasizing education as significant to leading a quality filled life; [[Paulo Freire]] (1998{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[#{{harvid|Freire|1970}}|1970]]) and his concept of participatory action research and the need to be politically aware; the work of Carr and Kremmis (1986){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Habermas]] (1992) and their concept and building critical educational knowledge; Professor Manheimer of UNC (1999){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and his challenge to his readers to enfold the past into the living present in order to become historical to oneself and then strive to linking life times with each other; Apple (1982){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Michel Foucault]] (1990){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and the role of power and politics in education and Joe Kincheloe (2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}, [[Henry Giroux]] (1997){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}, and [[Peter McLaren]] (1989){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and their promotion of critical pedagogy.

Prof. Barry was the first Ph.D. researcher to successfully use living educational theory in conjunction with [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), [[spiral dynamics]] and [[autoethnography]] (based on a [[multiple intelligences]] model which includes [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[emotional intelligence]] and embraces [[transpersonal]] knowing)  as valid methods of research working under the methodological umbrella of phenomenology and hermeneutics. His LET approach to Ph.D.level action research led to the unique use of fictional storytelling as a vehicle by which to replace the traditional literature review chapter in Ph.D. research but in a more rigorous and creative fashion. The process of [[storytelling]] allows the researcher to exercise their emotional intelligence in a superior manner than the traditional research literature review allows.

==Six cycles==

Living educational theory as defined and created by Barry is part of the curriculum of multiple courses at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] located in Silicon Valley, California in their credentialing program for teacher education. Barry's Living Educational Theory Action Research Method is based on a six step process&lt;ref&gt;(https://web.archive.org/web/20140310094005/http://www.ntu.edu/faculty-staff)&lt;/ref&gt; based on research questions that normally start from the format, " How can I influence the transformation of....?" or "How can I contribute to the improvement of...?" The research is dialectical in nature:

# I experience a crises in my sense of meaning when my values and beliefs as an educator/educational leader and/or learner are oppressed by my passive acceptance of the status quo and the use of oppressive power to change my identity. In essence, I experience narrative wreckage in my educational life (Thesis).
# I describe my contribution in promoting the [[status quo]] and my role in using oppressive power against others from both a [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[hermeneutical]] perspective to illuminate my living contradictions (Anti-thesis)

'''Louis Lallemant''' ([[Châlons-en-Champagne]] 1578 &amp;ndash; 5 April 1635 in [[Bourges]]) was a French [[Jesuit]].

After making his studies under the Fathers of the [[Society of Jesus]], [[Lallemant]] entered that order in 1605 in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. Having completed the usual course of study at the [[Pont-à-Mousson|University of Pont-à-Mousson]], he taught at the Jesuit colleges in [[La Flèche]], [[Bourges]] and [[Rouen]]. He was ordained and taught philosophy for some time until in 1622 he was made master of novices, an office he filled for four years. He then became professor of theology at Clermont College in Paris. In 1628 he was appointed director of [[Tertianship|tertians]], and as such, was responsible for the final year of formation for close to sixty Jesuits between 1628 and 1631. After three years in this post he broke down in health, and was sent to the college of [[Bourges]], in the hope that change of occupation would restore him. The hope was not to be fulfilled; he died after a few months.&lt;ref name=Woods&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08752e.htm Woods, Henry. "Louis Lallemant." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 10 Jan. 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lallemant has been called the [[Balthazar Alvarez]] of France; his ideals and efforts to meet them were as uncompromising as the latter's. Like Alvarez, Lallemant expected of others what he did himself. He set the high ideal before his [[Apprenticeship|disciple]]s, especially the Fathers of the third probation (Third Year), and required them to rise to such ideals. Lallemant was critical of those Jesuits so busy with work and study that they found no time for prayer. In reaction to what he perceived as overly secular aspirations on the part of some of his colleagues, Lallemant tended to emphasize the contemplative life over the active apostolate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theway.org.uk/back/561Bartok.pdf Bartok, Tibor. "Louis Lallemant and Jesuit Spirituality", ''the Way'', 56/1, January 2017, pp.31-44]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is known today chiefly by his ''“Doctrine Spirituelle”'', a collection of his maxims and instructions gathered together by Father Jean Rigoleuc, one of his disciples, and detailing very thoroughly his spiritual method.&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;

'''MediaCommons''' is an in-development all-electronic scholarly publishing network in media studies, being created in partnership with the [[Institute for the Future of the Book]] and with the support of [[New York University]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/about/ MediaCommons » About MediaCommons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/blog/2008/03/25/ifbook-nyu-the-neh-and-mediacommons/ MediaCommons » Blog Archive » if:book, NYU, the NEH, and MediaCommons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

MediaCommons established its first [[web presence|presence on the web]] in November 2006 with a now-defunct development site named "making MediaCommons,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academiccommons.org/library/mediacommons-project-moves-forward MediaCommons Project Moves Forward | Academic Commons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130223060002/http://www.academiccommons.org/library/mediacommons-project-moves-forward |date=2013-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened its current web site in March 2007.  The first project established on MediaCommons was [https://web.archive.org/web/20080513112255/http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/videos In Media Res], an ongoing feature in which notable scholars in media studies present and comment upon brief, timely videoclips, aiming to promote dialogue between scholars and the broader public about the significance of media representations and forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/videos/about In Media Res » About In Media Res&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705111609/http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/videos/about |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MediaCommons claims among its goals a transformation in scholarly publishing, suggesting that the network "will not simply shift the locus of publishing from print to screen, but will actually transform what it means to 'publish,' allowing the author, the publisher, and the reader all to make the process of such discourse just as visible as its product."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/about MediaCommons » About MediaCommons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The network promises to speed up the processes of publishing, but also to shift the focus of scholarly publishing back to communication amongst scholars.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  For this reason, the editors describe MediaCommons as a "scholarly network" rather than an electronic journal or press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.zdnet.com/?p=343 MediaCommons - more than a digital journal | Education IT | ZDNet.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

MediaCommons is also an experiment in reimagining the processes of peer review in the humanities, opening up the process to public debate and discussion, and using both web-based metrics and commentary to create a process of "peer-to-peer review."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2006/06/on_the_future_of_peer_review_i.html if:book: on the future of peer review in electronic scholarly publishing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511143435/http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2006/06/on_the_future_of_peer_review_i.html |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The backbone of this system is a social networking system currently being built by the NYU Digital Library Technology Services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nyu.edu/diglib/ New York University Libraries: Digital Library Technology Services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

MediaCommons has thus far published two commentable papers, one on [https://web.archive.org/web/20080511183306/http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/scholarlypublishing the future of scholarly publishing], and the other on [https://web.archive.org/web/20080511183258/http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/commentpress CommentPress], the [[WordPress]] theme developed by the [[Institute for the Future of the Book]] that allows for paragraph-by-paragraph commenting on lengthy documents.

The co-coordinating editors of MediaCommons are [[Kathleen Fitzpatrick (American academic)|Kathleen Fitzpatrick]] and [[Avi Santo]], and the project draws on the support of an editorial board of scholars from across the [[digital humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/editors/ MediaCommons » Founding editors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Curriculum Framework 2005''' is one of the four National Curriculum Frameworks published in 1975, 1988, 2000 and 2005 by the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]] [[NCERT]] in [[India]].

The Framework provides the framework for making syllabii,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and focus group discussion.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ncert.nic.in/rightside/links/focus_group.html National Focus Group Position Papers and NCF], National Council of Educational Research and Training, retrieved 2015-04-14.
&lt;/ref&gt; After wide ranging deliberations 21 National Focus Group Position Papers have been developed under the aegis of NCF-2005. The state of art position papers provided inputs for formulation of NCF-2005.
The document and its offshoot textbooks have come under different forms of reviews in the press.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ncert.nic.in/sites/publication/schoolcurriculum/ncf/News%20&amp;%20views.htm News on National Curriculum Framework], National Council of Educational Research and Training,  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205015357/http://www.ncert.nic.in/sites/publication/schoolcurriculum/ncf/News%20&amp;%20views.htm |date=February 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its draft document came under the criticism from the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE).&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.hindu.com/2005/08/07/stories/2005080705361000.htm NCERT draft curriculum framework criticised], The Hindu, 7 August 2005, retrieved 2015-04-14.
&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008 the director krishna kumar in an interview also discussed the challenges&lt;ref name=Frontline&gt;
[http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&amp;page=flonnet&amp;rdurl=fl2505/stories/20080314250509200.htm `Teaching profession is in a deep crisis'], Frontline, 1 March 2008, retrieved 2015-04-14.
&lt;/ref&gt; that are faced by the document.
The approach and recommendations of NCF-2005 are for the entire educational system. A number of its recommendations, for example, focus on rural schools. The syllabus and textbooks based on it are being used by all the [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] schools, but NCF-based material is also being used in many State schools.&lt;ref name=Frontline/&gt;

NCF 2005 has been translated into 22 languages and has influenced the syllabii in 17 States. The NCERT gave a grant of Rs.10 lakh to each State to promote NCF in the language of the State and to compare its current syllabus with the syllabus proposed, so that a plan for future reforms could be made. Several States have taken up this challenge. This exercise is being carried out with the involvement of State Councils for Educational Research and Training [SCERT] and District Institutes of Education and Training [DIET].

==Main Features of the NCF 2005==
The document is divided into 5 areas:

=== Perspective of NCF ===
'''The NCF was framed Considering the articulated ideas in the past such as'''
* To shift learning from rote method .
* Connecting knowledge to life outside the school.
* To integrate examination into classroom learning and make it more flexible.
* To enriching the curriculum so that it goes beyond textbooks.
* Nurturing an over-riding identity informed by caring concerns within the democratic polity of the country.&lt;ref name="NCF2005"&gt;{{cite web|last1=2005|first1=NCF|title=NCF2005|url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/rightside/links/pdf/framework/english/nf2005.pdf|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NCF focused on'''
* ''Learning without burden'' to make learning a joyful experience and move away from textbooks to be a basis for [[Test (assessment)|examination]] and to remove stress from children. It recommended major changes in the design of syllabus.
* To develop a sense of self-reliance and dignity of the individual which would for the basis of social relationship and would develop a sense of nonviolence and oneness across the society.
* To develop a child centered approach and to promote universal enrollment and retention up to the age of 14.
* To inculcate the feeling of oneness, democracy and unity in the students the [[curriculum]] is enabled to strengthen our national identity and to enable the new generation reevaluate.
* J. P. Naik has described equality, quality and quantity as the exclusive triangle for Indian education. 
* With respect to social context NCF 2005 has ensured that irrespective of [[caste]], [[creed]], religion and sex all are provided with a standard curriculum.

=== Learning and knowledge ===

Learning should be an enjoyable act where children should feel that they are valued and their voices are heard. The curriculum structure and school should be designed to make school a satisfactory place for students to feel secure and valued.The curriculum should focus on the [[holistic]] development of the students to enhance physical and mental development in individuals and as well as with the peer interactions.

In order to bring about the overall development of the students, adequate nutrition, physical exercise and other psycho social needs are addressed the participation in yoga and sports is required. learning should be made enjoyable and should relate to real life experiences learning should involve concepts and deeper understanding.
[[Adolescence]] is a vulnerable age for students and the curriculum should prepare the students and provide support for social and emotional support that will inculcate positive behavior and provide skills essential to cope with situations that they encounter in their lives, peers pressure and gender stereotype.&lt;ref name="NCF2005"/&gt;

Inclusive education to be given priority and flexibility to follow a curriculum to suit the needs of every student irrespective of students having disabilities.

Constructive learning has to be part of the curriculum. Situations and opportunities have to be created for students to provide students with challenges, encourage creativity and active participation for students. Students have to be encouraged to interact with [[peer group|peers]], teachers and older people which would open up many more rich learning opportunities.

The foundation should be laid strong and firm. primary, upper primary and middle school should provide the space for children to explore and develop rational thinking that they would imbibe in them and have sufficient knowledge of concepts, [[language]], [[knowledge]], investigation and validation procedures.

'''NETA''' ({{lang-he|'''נ'''וער ל'''ט'''ובת '''ה'''עברית}}, ''{{transl|he|No'ar leTovat ha'Ivrit}}''), literally '''Youth in Favour of Hebrew''', is a [[Hebrew language]] [[curriculum]] for students&lt;!-- created by the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]{{cn}}--&gt;.  Following the subsequent involvement of the Israeli Center for Educational Technology,{{when|date=May 2014}} the program was rebranded '''NETA–CET'''.

The curriculum is described as a more modern, "holistic" approach to the teaching of Hebrew, in response to perceived deficiencies in more traditional approaches used in [[Jewish day school]]s and other Hebrew language programs.&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Birkner, [http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new_york/new_look_hebrew_instruction "The New Look Of Hebrew Instruction"], ''[[The Jewish Week]]'', September 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] showed that the NETA curriculum did not appear to be an effective teaching method for students with [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305041002|title=Is it the right fit?

The '''Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education''' ('''ODCTE''', commonly known and branded as '''CareerTech''') is an agency of the state of [[Oklahoma]] located in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]].

CareerTech oversees a statewide system of career and technology education. The system comprises 29 technology center districts and 390 comprehensive school districts. CareerTech also has skills centers that serve state correctional facilities and a juvenile detention facility. The State Board of Career and Technology Education is the governing body of the department, composed of the [[Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction]] and eight members appointed by the [[Governor of Oklahoma]] with the approval of the [[Oklahoma Senate]]. The board appoints the director of Career and Technology Education, who serves as the chief executive officer of the department and serves as a non-voting member of the state board.

On Feb. 1, 2015, Dr. Marcie Mack became the system's eighth state director.

Together with the [[Oklahoma State Department of Education]] and the [[Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education]], the department forms the core of Oklahoma's public education system.

==History==
The Oklahoma CareerTech System began with the passing of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 by President Woodrow Wilson. This act made available federal money for the promotion of vocational education. In 1929, the Division of Vocational Education was established as part of the State Department of Education. The department moved from Oklahoma City to Stillwater in 1932, and in 1941, the state legislature established the position of state director of vocational education. J.B Perky was the first director. In 1966, Oklahoma technology center school districts were formed, and in 1967, Tri County Tech became the state's first area vocational-technical school. On July 1, 1968, the Oklahoma State Board of Vocational and Technical Education was established as a separate entity from the State Department of Education. In 1971, the first delivery of training to inmates in a [http://www.okcareertech.org/skillscenters/ Skills Center] at the Ouachita facility took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okcareertech.org/educators/cimc/resources/downloads-1/learning-to-earn/learning-to-earn/history_of_careertech_lo_res.pdf/at_download/file|title=Major Milestones of Career and Technology Education in Oklahoma|work=okcareertech.org|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2000, [[Governor of Oklahoma]] [[Frank Keating]] signed House Bill 2128, which officially and immediately changed its name to the Department of Career and Technology Education.

==Economic Impact==
Recent Census Bureau survey data indicate that Oklahoma workers who have completed the equivalent of a two-year program with a vocational or occupational emphasis earned 20 percent more than workers with only high school diplomas the past two decades. These income gains can in turn contribute significantly to the overall level of income statewide. Over the work life, a typical career major completer can expect to add more than $475,000, or $188,000 in current dollars, to lifetime earnings relative to completing no additional education beyond high school. 

In current dollars, the direct benefits are $1.84 billion in future income gains to completers, $138 million in added tax revenue to state and local government, and direct in-state spending of $185 million for the delivery of the career major instructional programs statewide. Indirect benefits include $1.66 billion in estimated spillover income gains to the broader state economy which in turn produce $124 million in tax revenue.

==Leadership==
The department is led by the state director and the CareerTech board. Dr. Marcie Mack serves as the state director.

===Board of Career and Technology Education===

The State Board of Career and Technology Education is a nine-member board composed of the [[Oklahoma superintendent of public instruction]] (who serves as the chairman of the board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sde.state.ok.us/agen/default.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207094640/http://sde.state.ok.us/agen/default.html |archivedate=2007-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), two members of the [[Oklahoma State Board of Education]], one member from each of the state's congressional districts and one at-large member.

All members, except ex officio members, are appointed by the [[governor of Oklahoma]] and confirmed by the [[Oklahoma Senate]].

As of 2015, the chairman is Joy Hofmeister, Oklahoma superintendent of public instruction.

Current members include Major General Leo J. Baxter, Bill Price, Janet Smith, Dave Stewart, Philip Kennedy, Marilyn Harrel, Randy Gilbert and Tim Burg.

'''Olaus Magnus Friedrich Erdmann Henrici''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (9 March 1840, [[Meldorf]], [[Duchy of Holstein]] – 10 August 1918, [[Chandler's Ford]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]]) was a German mathematician who became a professor in [[London]].

After three years as an apprentice in engineering, Henrici entered [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology|Karlsruhe Polytechnium]] where he came under the influence of [[Alfred Clebsch]] who encouraged him in mathematics. He then went to Heidelberg where he studied with [[Otto Hesse]]. Henrici attained his Dr. phil. degree on 6 June 1863 at [[University of Heidelberg]]. He continued his studies in Berlin with [[Karl Weierstrass]] and [[Leopold Kronecker]]. He was briefly [[docent]] of mathematics and physics at the [[University of Kiel]], but ran into financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/content/s2-17/1/1.3.extract | title=Professor Olaus Henrici | last=Hill | first=M. J. M. |authorlink=Micaiah John Muller Hill| journal=[[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society|Proc. London Math. Soc.]] | year=1918 | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=xlii–xlix | doi=10.1112/plms/s2-17.1.1-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henrici moved to London in 1865 where he worked as a private [[tutor]]. In 1869 Hesse introduced him to [[J. J. Sylvester]] who in turn brought him into contact with [[Arthur Cayley]], [[William Kingdon Clifford]], and [[Thomas Archer Hirst]]. It was Hirst that gave him some work at [[University College London]]. Henrici also became a [[professor]] at [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]]. When Hirst fell ill, Henrici filled his position at University College. He held the position until 1884, turning to [[applied mathematics]] after 1880.

From 1882 to 1884 Henrici was President of the [[London Mathematical Society]]. 
In 1884 he moved to [[Central Technical College]] where he directed a Laboratory of [[Mechanics]] which included calculating machines, [[planimeter]]s, moment integrators, and a harmonic analyzer.&lt;ref&gt;O. Henrici (1894) [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/122066#page/124/mode/1up On a New Harmonic Analyzer], [[Philosophical Magazine]] July, page 110, from [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Henrici was impressed by the work of [[Robert Stawell Ball]] in [[screw theory]] as presented in a German textbook by Gravelius.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gravelius (1889) ''Theoretische Mechanik starrer Systeme auf Grund der Methoden und Arbeiten und mit einem Vorworte von Sir Robert Ball, Royal Astronomer of Ireland''. Berlin: Georg Reimer&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 Henrici wrote a [[book review]] for [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] outlining the program of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;O. Henrici (1890) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v42/n1075/pdf/042127b0.pdf "Theory of Screws"], ''Nature'' 42:127–32 (#1075)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 he retired and took up [[gardening]] at [[Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="739">The '''parish family book''' ({{lang-la|Status animarum}}, meaning "State of Souls") is a register of people living in a [[parish]] and of events related to them. It is particularly characteristic of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The parish family books were prescribed in the ''[[Rituale Romanum]]'' published in 1614 by [[Pope Paul V]]. At first, they only contained data about [[sacrament]]s received, religious knowledge, and religious affiliation. In the 18th century other data were added such as house numbers and ages. The parish family books were maintained by [[parish priest]]s. They were most precise in villages because the population was more stable there than in cities.

'''Peace Cafés''' are [[peace]]-positive cafés in [[Canada]] that have declared an adherence to [[Manifesto 2000]], in addition to [[fair trade]], [[living wage]], and local [[organic foods]] standards while also utilizing their space for community gatherings on [[social justice]] and peace issues.  The designation is a registered [[trade mark]] of [[Canadian Centres for Teaching Peace]] (CCTP).

==Origin==
In 2006, CCTP founder Robert "Bob" Stewart drafted a prospectus for creating community-based centres for public peace education, called "Peace Cafés." Initiatives began in [[Hamilton, Ontario]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.activistmagazine.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=777&amp;Itemid=143 "Centre for Teaching Peace and Peace Café opens in Hamilton"], Activist Magazine 21 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Calgary, Alberta]] in 2007 to secure partnerships with existing cafés or to open completely new spaces. In December 2007, the Hamilton initiative secured a partnership with the downtown Sky Dragon Community Development Co-operative, with Robert Porter as local director. In 2008, Robert Porter extended the Peace Café family with a partnership in his rural hometown of [[Walkerton, Ontario]], with the White Rose Coffeehouse.

As of March 2009 there are groups in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], [[Nelson, British Columbia]],&lt;ref name="selkirk0309"&gt;[http://selkirk.ca/about/news/name-15490-en.php Peace Café Advocates Change in Thinking], Selkirk College / Peace Café Nelson partnership announcement 09 march 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and [[Calgary, Alberta]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/12926 "Cafe with peace on the menu opens soon"], University of Calgary Gauntlet 23 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; working towards additional partnerships in their respective communities.

==Philosophy==
Peace Cafés are described as "safe community spaces dedicated to developing a [[Peace|Culture of Peace]] at the community level through dialogue, conversation, workshops, and a library of peace resources along with wholesome food and drink options."

'''Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science''' (PJAS) is a statewide organization in [[Pennsylvania]] founded in 1934. The organization is open to all students of participating schools in grades 7 through 12. Students can participate in both a regional meet as well as a state meet at [[Penn State University]].  1st Award winners from their regional meets are invited to compete at the state meet where they are given the opportunity present their projects again to win a wide range of awards like $8,000 ($2,000 per year) Penn State scholarships, and other special awards (PA Science Talent Search, Director’s Awards, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pjas.net/about-pjas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pjas-region2.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science, sponsored by the [https://pennsci.org/ Pennsylvania Academy of Science], as an Affiliate of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)]], is organized with the following objectives:
* To promote greater participation in science and mathematics activities among the youth of Pennsylvania.
* To improve the quality of achievement in mathematics and science by encouraging students to participate in research and develop original ideas.
* To develop an understanding of the scientific community through close association with leaders in the sciences.
* To seek the improvement of science clubs activities through the cooperative regional and state meetings.
* To inculcate among its members true scientific attitudes and humanistic ideals that shall lead to the greater development of service to man.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pjas.net/about-pjas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pjasix.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science (PJAS) is a statewide organization of junior and senior high school students designed to stimulate and promote interest in science among its members through the development of research projects and investigations.&lt;ref&gt;http://pjas-region2.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] is divided into 12 PJAS regions. Each PJAS region consists of two or more counties. Every PJAS region has one or more directors and a treasurer who oversee the operation of the region. PJAS also has a State Director, a State Secretary, and State Treasurer as well as committees for Judging, Safety, Technicians, and Awards.

In the early 1930s, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)]] appointed a national executive committee to coordinate the activities of the various state Junior Academies of Science (JAS).  Thus, the JAS movement became an integral part of the AAAS organization with the formation of the National Junior Academy of Science (NJAS). A paper presented at the Pennsylvania Academy of Science (PAS) at its West Chester meeting in 1932 resulted in the appointment of a committee to consider the development of a junior academy in Pennsylvania; the senior PAS became the parent organization of PJAS as a result of this committee. Two years later on March 31, 1934 in Reading, PA, delegates from 14 high school science clubs from all parts of the Commonwealth approved a constitution for the PJAS organization. The Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science had become a reality. Dr. Otis W. Caldwell from Columbia University served as an official delegate of the AAAS and welcomed the new group. Pennsylvania was added to the states of Indiana, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, and others that already established junior academies of science. The first PJAS State Director was Dr. Karl F. Oerlein of the California State Teachers College in California, PA. He continued his office until 1941.

PJAS has grown through the efforts and dedication of many adult sponsors, students, and alumni. PJAS conducted the early state meetings at various resorts and convention centers throughout the Commonwealth. The last such convention was at Seven Springs Resort in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcsta.org/pjas/&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the enormous growth in the number of students participating; the State Meeting was moved to Penn State University at University Park, PA, in 1991 where it has occurred since.

In 2010, 551 schools participated in PJAS (compared to 14 schools in 1934); over 6000 students presented their scientific research at the regional level in 2010. The 2016 state meeting hosted 2350 presenters in 231 units. Units are groups of students with projects in similar categories – for example, Unit 14 could be 10th grade Biochemistry, Unit 79 could be 9th and 10th grade Physics, etc. The number of units and the category of each unit varies each year based upon the number of student presenters and their projects. The total number at the State Meeting including student presenters, technicians, sponsors and chaperones was almost 4000 in 2016. Each year a different region hosts the State Meeting.

==Projects==
PJAS projects fall under four main groups: Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, or Engineering projects. Each of these categories use their own individualized rubric.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pjas.net/presentation-guidelines&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science Projects===
Consists of projects in the following categories:
* '''Behavioral Psychology (BEH)''' – The systematic investigation of mental phenomena of human and other animals, especially those associated with consciousness, behavior and the problems of adjustment to the environment.
* '''Biology (BIO)''' – This category is for the life science projects which do not fall into any other category. This includes, but is not limited to, projects involving human medicine and dentistry.
* '''Biochemistry (BC)''' – The study of chemistry within living organisms with emphasis of the process.
* '''Botany (BOT)''' – The study of plants.
* '''Chemistry (CHM)''' – The study of the composition of matter and how matter can change.
* '''Earth and Space (ES)''' – The study of the earth and extraterrestrial bodies and the processes affecting them. This includes, but is not limited to projects involving geology, oceanography, meteorology and astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.astro.psu.edu/~kluhman/pjas/pjas.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ecology (ECO)''' – The study of the interactions and relationships of living things to their abiotic environment and to each other. This includes, but is not limited to projects involving pollution, environmental alterations, and ecosystem analysis.
* '''Microbiology (MIC)''' – The study of microorganisms, which are defined as any microscopic organism that comprises either a single cell (unicellular) or cell cluster. This includes eukaryotes such as fungi and protists, and bacteria and prokaryotes.
* '''Physics (PHY)''' – The study of matter and motion. This includes, but is not limited to projects involving the traditional subsets of physics (i.e. statics, dynamics, optics, acoustics, heat and electricity) and applied physics (i.e. mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering).
* '''Zoology (ZOO)''' – The study of animals. This includes, but is not limited to projects involving animal physiology, animal anatomy, animal pathology, and animal genetics.

===Mathematics Projects===
Consists of projects heavily focused on mathematics, or projects proving mathematical theories. Projects that use some math that is not the main focus of the project should be considered for other categories before being labeled as a math project.

===Computer Science Projects===
Consists of projects that test computer programs, algorithms, computer languages, and hardware.

===Engineering Projects===
Consists of projects aimed to solve practical problems, focused in electrical, civil, and mechanical engineering. Can also include projects dealing with energy engineering, nanoengineering, and data engineering. Engineering is a new category, first implemented in the 2015 PJAS season with the regional and state meets.

==Regional Meets==
The program is split up into 12 regions (including regions 1A, 1B, and 1C) spanning from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Lake Erie]]. Each of these regions hold a private science competition between January and March where students present their research to a panel of judges. These judges score the student's project using PJAS rubrics for the specific category (see [[Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science#Projects|Projects]]) - projects are not judged against each other, but against a set of criteria (see [[Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science#Scoring Rubrics|Scoring Rubrics]]). Each region has its own regional director(s) in charge of coordinating the regions for the regional and state meet, in addition to school sponsor(s) (teacher(s) hosting a school team). It is possible to have regional director(s) also acting as school sponsor(s).

After students present their research, the judges deliberate and determine the student's score based on the appropriate PJAS rubric. Some regions host an awards ceremony or an awards dinner. At these events, students receive a certificate and a bar with the color of their award (See [[Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science#Pin .26 Bars|Pin &amp; Bars]]). Some regions gain enough funding to also support special awards (like Director's awards or ones sponsored by societies or companies) for students who score the highest in their respective category or based on other criterion. For example, Region 1A had awards at their 2016 Regional Meet for students with exceptional analysis sections, exceptional research, or outstanding projects their judges nominate. Special awards at the regional meet aren't required for PJAS and thus, depend on each region.

== State Meet ==
The PJAS State meet is a multi-day event similar to Regional Meets, always occurring from a Sunday to Tuesday in mid-May. Students who earned a first award at their respective regional meet are invited to travel to the [[University Park, Pennsylvania|main campus (University Park)]] of the [[Pennsylvania State University]] to present their projects; students who earned a 2nd or 3rd award at their Regional Meet could attend States as a technician, but will not present their projects. Students stay in the PSU dorms and eat in the dining halls while at the State Meet. Students present the same project they presented at the Regional Meet for the chance to win awards and scholarships.

Students who do not earn a 1st at their Regional Meet can attend States as a technician. Technicians serve a crucial role in PJAS by serving as the timers of projects and the judges’ questions. If / when the presenter reaches the 5-minute mark, 8-minute mark, and 10-minute mark, the technician holds up a corresponding card to notify the presenter. For example, when the presentation reaches 5 minutes, the “5 Minutes Remaining” card is held in the air for the presenter to see. PJAS presenters have a time-limit of 10 minutes for their presentation to still earn a first award – going over 10 minutes is an automatic second award for the presenter, hence the crucial role of the technician. Technicians also time the judges when they ask questions following the presentation, with a maximum time of 5 minutes to ask questions.

For meals, students eat in the Findlay Dining Commons. The meals paid are paid for when paying for the State meet. Meals paid for by the State Meet fee are:
* Sunday dinner
* Monday breakfast, lunch, and dinner
* Tuesday breakfast

=== Sunday ===
Students travel to Main Campus with their region (sometimes in individual cars, sometimes on [[Coach (bus)|coach buses]] if traveling for several hours). The exact date varies from year to year but is typically the same weekend of Penn State's graduation or the weekend directly after. Approximately 2,350 students presented their research at the 2015 State Meet.

Upon arriving at Main Campus, regional directors pick up dorm keys and meal cards from the Glass Lounge. Everyone attending the state meet receives a packet with a lanyard, name tag, a campus map, a big PJAS booklet with every presenting student’s name / project title / school, in addition a Penn State magazine, PSU merchandise, and coupon to purchase discounted PSU items at the bookstore. Adults judging receive a second packet detailing their judging assignment. Because there may be a shortage of judges, some adults may get a second judging assignment – one for the AM session (senior high projects) and another for the PM session (junior high projects). Non-judging chaperones receive their chaperone duty in their packet, detailing when and where they are chaperoning; typical chaperone duties include helping to direct students at the awards ceremony or watching over the sports complex for no more than 2 hours. In previous years when the PJAS dance was held on the Monday night after the Special Awards Ceremony, many chaperones would be assigned to the dance.

After picking up and distributing packets and room keys, females head to their dorm building and males head to their different dorm building. Students and chaperones can also arrange to stay off campus. PJAS typically houses participants in the [[List of Pennsylvania State University residence halls#East|East Halls]], but a few regions are housed in the [[List of Pennsylvania State University residence halls#Pollock Halls|Pollock Halls]]. PSU meal cards double as their dorm building key and they are each tested upon first entering the building. Students are then able to head to their rooms. Two students are normally housed together in one room, but rarely three students will be assigned to one room.

After Monday’s dinner, each region hosts its own information meeting for students presenting their projects the following day run by their regional director(s) in a large lecture hall. Students attending the State Meet as Technicians attend one big meeting to go over the process, rules, and requirements of their duties.
On Sunday night, it is common for student presenters to practice their presentations in their dorm or somewhere else on campus to prepare for Monday’s presentation.

=== Monday ===
Monday a full day of presentations and awards. Student presentations are split into two groups: Senior High and Junior High. Students who attend the State Meet as day packages arrive Monday morning to present and attend the awards ceremonies.

==== Morning - Senior High Presentations ====
Students find their unit and presenting location by locating themselves in the PJAS booklet – occasionally, senior high students will present with junior high students because of conflicts with AP testing and some junior high students may present with senior high students because of other scheduling conflicts. Senior High students eat breakfast and head to their building to present their project dressed in business casual clothes. It is normal to see many students proudly displaying their PJAS [[Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science#Pin .26 Bars|Pin &amp; Bars]] on their jacket, shirt, or blouse.

Presentations were conducted using [[overhead projectors]] and [[Transparency (projection)|transparency slides]] to present projects through 2014. From 2013 to 2015, PJAS was phasing out these old technologies for modern [[LCD projectors]]; all presentations were presented digitally at the 2015 State Meet. All digital presentations are saved/exported as [[PDF|PDF files]] - no animations, videos, or sounds will appear during the presentation. Students upload their projects several days before arriving to Penn State with a special file uploader specifically made for PJAS. When students arrive in their unit Monday morning (or afternoon for junior high students), all of the projects to be presented are in the presenting program queued up. When all of the judges and technician(s) arrive, presentations can begin. Penn State students are available in each presenting building to help with any technological problems. Presentations at States are almost exactly the same as the presentations at regionals, but State presentation units can have students and judges from across PA rather than from the same region.

While senior high students are presenting, junior high students have the morning to practice, visit downtown’s shops, visit the [[Penn State University Creamery|Penn State Creamery]], play outside if the weather is nice, or other things.

==== Afternoon ====
When all of the morning presentations are over, students can head back to their dorms right away to get changed into regular clothes before going to lunch or do what was instructed by their sponsor or regional director. Judges meet in the first floor of Findlay immediately following the unit’s presentations to deliberate scores and come to a conclusion on each project’s award. This is done immediately because the Senior High Awards Ceremony start right after students eat lunch, occurring in [[University Park, Pennsylvania#Major landmarks|Eisenhower Auditorium]] at 1PM.

Junior high students get changed into their presenting clothes and go to lunch before their presentations begin at 1:15PM. They follow the same process as senior high presentations.

==== Morning Awards Ceremony (Senior High Students) ====

Approximately 1300 high school presenters from all corners of PJAS receive their award at this ceremony. Photo by Liam Chambers.]]
The Senior High Awards Ceremony is where each of the morning presenters receives a certificate and pin(s) for their placement. Each unit is called, alternating between odd units and even units. Each student’s name is called one by one with their award announced. An example unit being called sounds like this:

''“Unit 17 please line up. Unit 34: John Doe, first award. Bob Doe, second award. Jane Doe, first award and perfect score (applause). James Doe, third award, Janet Doe, honorable mention, and Jack Doe, first award.”''

For juniors interviewing for scholarships, they leave at 2PM (or immediately after receiving their award, if they have not yet). to interview. When the award ceremony is over, everyone leaves Eisenhower. Senior high students not interviewing have free time that can be spent back in the dorms, they can go off campus to visit stores and shops, eat ice cream from the renowned [[Penn State University Creamery|Penn State Creamery]], or their school or region could have other events planned.

==== Junior High Presentations ====
While the Senior High Award Ceremony is taking place, the junior high students are presenting their projects in their units just like the senior high students did hours prior, starting at 1:15PM. When these presentations conclude, students return to their dorms to get changed for dinner or do what was instructed by their sponsor or regional director.
During this time, senior high students are free to visit downtown’s shops, visit the [[Penn State University Creamery|Penn State Creamery]], play outside if the weather is nice, or other things.

==== Evening ====
The evening is filled with more award ceremonies and is one of the biggest parts of the PJAS State Meet.

====Junior High Award Ceremonies====
After dinner is the Junior High Awards Ceremony. Since the 2013 State Meet onward, PJAS has stopped holding one massive Junior High Awards Ceremony in [[University Park, Pennsylvania#Major landmarks|Eisenhower Auditorium]] due to time constraints with preparing for the Special Awards Ceremony. The large ceremony followed exactly the same process as the Senior High Awards Ceremony. Now, each region’s Junior High Award Ceremony in held different lecture halls across campus at the same time. Depending on the number of middle school students, this awards ceremony could take a few minutes or could be over an hour long; it is less formal and much quicker than the senior high awards. Each middle school student’s name is called along with his/her award just like the senior high awards ceremony. Students receive a corresponding pin for their award and a certificate.

====Special Awards Ceremony====
The Special Awards Ceremony is held in Eisenhower starting at 8PM. All 1st Award winners are strongly suggested to attend; failure to attend could mean forfeiting any award(s) won. This awards ceremony is the first and only time '''all''' PJAS students (senior high and junior high) are together. Dozens of awards are distributed to students across all grades paired with monetary prizes. Students can win awards ranging from $50 to $8,000, with scholarships awarding the most money.

Awards at the Special Awards Ceremony include:
* The PA Science Talent Search's ''Outstanding Senior Award'' (4 given each year)
* D.E. Zappa Award (4 given each year, two to senior high students and two to junior high students)
* Director's Award – one each category (13) in junior high and in senior high.
* Penn State Scholarships – $2,000 a year for a possible 4 years. Students may only interview for a maximum of two of these scholarships. To be used, Penn State requires students to be (1) in the top 5% of their class, (2) have a combined SAT score (critical reading + math) of at least 1300, and (3) the student must receive a 1st or 2nd award at the State Meet:
** College of Agriculture Scholarship
** College of Earth and Mineral Sciences Scholarship
** College of Engineering Scholarship
** Eberly College of Science Scholarship
'''Note:''' There is no set limit on the number of scholarships awarded – for example, the Eberly College of Science awarded over 50 scholarships at the 2016 State Meet, and these numbers vary each year.
* American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) National Convention - All-expenses paid, student will be reimbursed for air travel, 1 delegate and 1 alternate.
* Marine Science Camp (location varies each year) - 1 week, expenses paid, student is responsible for travel, 1 delegates and 1 alternate.
* The Commonwealth Medical College Fellowship Award - Two days spent with med students and researchers on the campus of TCMC in Scranton. All expenses paid. July 22 and 23, 2015.  1 delegate and 1 alternate.  Student responsible for travel.
* Several memorial awards, in honor of previous PJAS Directors or persons.


After the Special Award's Ceremony, students are free to take part in various activities, hang out in the dorms, or do things their region/sponsor has planned. PJAS offers movie(s) to view outside and often, the Penn State Astronomy Department has telescopes set up on the HUB lawn (weather permitting). Up until the 2014 State Meet, PJAS also had a student dance in the IM Building.

===Tuesday===
This is a very quick day. Each region’s schedule varies depending on their departure time, but most regions wake up early, eat breakfast, clear out their rooms and return their keys before loading the busses. Buses cannot leave until key collection is finished and checked by the regional director(s) and Penn State key personnel.

==Pin &amp; Bars==
[[File:PJAS Bars - Liam Chambers (2014).jpg|90px|thumb|right|An example PJAS Pin and Bars from a senior in 2014. Photo taken by Liam Chambers]]

The PJAS pin and bars are unique to the organization. Students earn bar(s) for each competition (except for honorable mention) that are colored to reflect performance. Students can earn bars at each regional meet and each state meet they present a project and connect them together to form a chain or history of their performance. The bar attached to the pin is the oldest project and the newest project is at the bottom. Returning members of PJAS like to wear their pins and bar while presenting during meets.
Depending on the student and his/her projects, it is possible for students to earn more than the 10 bars that could be earned if the student participated for all five years. Students earning a First Award Perfect Score earn two pins - one for their first award and a second for their perfect score. Therefore, it is theoretically possible for a student who competes in all 12 competitions to earn a maximum of 24 bars if the student earns a perfect score at '''every''' meet for all six years.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Award !! Regional Meet !! State Meet !! Score (out of 5.00)
|-
| Perfect Score || White || White "State" || 5.00
|-
| 1st Award || Blue || Blue "State" || 4.00 to 4.99
|-
| 2nd Award || Red || Red "State" || 3.00 to 3.99
|-
| 3rd Award || Yellow || Yellow "State" || 2.00 to 2.99
|-
| Honorable Mention || No bar || No bar || 1.00 to 1.99
|}

In the example pin and bar on the right, it can be seen that the student's first project earned a 1st Award at his Regional Meet and a 2nd Award at the State Meet. In his second year, he earned a 1st at Regionals and 1st Award Perfect Score at States. Then, a 1st award at both the Regional and State Meets in his third year, followed by a 1st Award Perfect Score at his fourth Regional Meet and a 1st Award at the State Meet. In his fifth and final year as a presenter, he earned 1st Award Perfect Scores at both the Regional and State Meets for that particular project.

==Scoring Rubric==
PJAS participants and their projects are not judged against each other like other fairs. Instead, each project is independently judged based on a rubric. Each rubric for the four project types consists of five categories with a maximum score of 5.00 points in each category. Each judge's numbers influence the final score because it is their combined average that make up the point value. To proceed to the state meet, a participant must receive an average score of 4.00 or greater (or a perfect 5.00) to earn a 1st Award at the Regional Meet. Participants who receive 2nd awards (an average score between 3.00 and 3.99) may be eligible to go on the state trip as a technician possibly. Participants that go over 10 minutes in presentation length automatically earn a second award based on the criteria in each rubric and thus are ineligible to compete at the state meet.

For each category, on each rubric, 1-5 points may be awarded. The following table describes each point value.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Point value (out of 5)
|-
| Exceeds Characteristics  || 5
|-
| Meets ALL of the Characteristics || 4
|-
| Meets MOST of the Characteristics  || 3
|-
| Meets FEW of the Characteristics  || 2
|-
| Meets NONE of the Characteristics || 1
|}

Scoring rubrics vary by category type but share two of the same sections between all rubric types ''(italicized)''. These are the category section on each rubric.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pjas.net/science-presentations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pjas.net/component/content/article/71-competition/presentation/271-engineering-presentations&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petrozavodsk State University (PetrSU)''' is a classical university in [[Petrozavodsk]], [[Republic of Karelia]], [[Russia|Russian Federation]]. 
It was founded in 1940 as the Karelian-Finnish University and was renamed in 1956. The rector of Petrozavodsk State University is Prof. Anatoly V. Voronin.

== General information ==

[[File:PetrSU English 2017.ogv|thumb|Petrozavodsk State University, 2017]]

The university includes 10 faculties, 6 educational institutes, 79 departments, 84 laboratories, a number of development and project departments, 27 innovative departments, 28 small enterprises, 2 techno parks, a publishing house, a scientific library (one of the largest in northern [[European Russia]], with more than 1,179,042 books), a [[botanical garden]], and the "Onego" swimming pool. The faculties of PetrSU are located in 13 separate buildings scattered throughout the city.

PetrSU faculty numbers about 890 (105 doctors of science, 502 candidates of science, 66 professors, and 329 associate professors). More than 11,670 [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] students currently study at PetrSU.

PetrSU holds the top spot among Russian universities in the criteria of "[[internationalization]]" and the third spot in the promotion of the employment of its students and graduates. PetrSU has 92 international agreements with foreign universities, research organizations, and science-and-production companies in 30 countries ([[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Portugal]], the [[UK]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Belgium]], the [[Republic of Korea]], the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], the [[Baltic states]], and others). Various PetrSU programs have been in heavy demand from international students including short-term programs taught in English, semester-long programs, and exchange programs with partner universities taught in both Russian and English. More than 200 international students (mostly from Northern and Eastern Europe, the UK, the USA, and China) study at PetrSU annually. More than 250 students and staff of PetrSU visit foreign universities annually for reasons such as exchange programs, research, Erasmus Mundus internships, and [[FIRST]], among others. PetrSU carries out about 30 international projects annually with the help of funding from the [[EU]], [[EBRD]], [[USAID]], [[CRDF]], [[International Research &amp; Exchanges Board|IREX]], [[German Academic Exchange Service|DAAD]], the [[Nordic Council of Ministers]], and others.

PetrSU prepares enrollees for university entrance. Students have the opportunity to obtain bachelor's, master's, and specialist's degrees in 13 fields of science and 63 licensed specialties. There is a wide range of areas for the preparation of doctoral theses and the training and retraining of specialists. At present there are 4 Dissertation Councils at the university.

== History ==

=== Foundation of the University ===

[[File:Botanical Garden of PetrSU.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Botanical Garden of Petrozavodsk State University]]

On April 24, 1940 the congress of the [[Communist party|Communist Party]] [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|KFSSR]] was held, where the leader of Karelo-Finnish SSR G.N. Kupriyanov showed his report. It claimed that it’s needed to pay special attention to the development of higher education in the region in order to improve the economic and cultural life and science of the country. On June 2, 1940 a decree of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] and the Council of People's Commissars of the Karelo-Finnish SSR "About opening of the Karelian-Finnish State University" was published. The leadership of the USSR supported this decision, and the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR adopted a resolution № 1209 about the opening of the Karelian-Finnish State University (based on the Karelian State Pedagogical Institute) on June 10, 1940. The university was called KFGU in abbreviated form, consisted of 4 [[faculty (division)|faculties]]: historical and philological, physical and mathematical, biological, geographical and hydrogeological. The goal of university was preparing a large number of specialists for the national economy and the development of scientific research.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=11}}

Formation of the University turned out to very tricky process. A lot of difficult problems had to be solved connected with the simultaneous building of classrooms, accommodation for teachers and students, purchase of the necessary equipment and appliances, integration of scientific university libraries, the development of work plans and teaching aids. However, all these problems have been solved, and in autumn 1940 17 [[Academic department|departments]], which counted 62 teachers, including 5 [[Doctor of Philosophy|PHD]] ([[professor]]s) and 32 [[Docent|associate professors]] began work in the university.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=12}} On September 2, 1940, more than 700 students of all courses began their studying at a young university, 417 people of them were freshmen. On September 7, 1940 a grand opening of the university took place.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=13}}

[[Tuure Lehén|Tuuri Ivanovich Lehen]] was appointed as the [[Rector (academia)|first head]] of the university. Konstantin Dmitrievich Mitropolsky was appointed as the [[Prorector|vice-president]] on Academic Affairs and Research. Faculty deans were appointed:{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=11}}
* M.G. Nikulin - History and Philology Department, 
* A.A. Raykerus - Physics and Mathematics Department, 
* E.D. Manevitch - Department of Biology, 
* M.A. Toikka - geological and hydrological Department.

On May 21, 1941 the Scientific Council was approved, that consisted of 25 members. The Council solved the various issues associated with university life, and could award academic degrees and titles in the following specialties: [[theoretical physics]], [[Human body|human and animal physiology]], [[plant physiology]], [[genetics]], [[History of the Soviet Union|history of the USSR]], [[folklore]].{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=13}}

=== University in the Great Patriotic War ===

[[File:Finnish advance in Karelia during the Continuation War.png|thumb|right|Finnish advance in Karelia during the [[Continuation War]]. Old border marked in grey.]]

The first [[school year]] was coming to an end, students were passing the [[Test (assessment)|session]] making plans for the summer. But these plans were not realized. On June 22, 1941 at 4.00 am the [[Great Patriotic War]] began. In connection with this event on June 28 the general university [[meeting]] was held in [[Petrozavodsk]] at which the participants expressed their desire to fight against the enemy and to give their strength for the victory over him. During the first months of the [[war]] the students, the members of staff, teachers went to the [[Front (military)|front]], also the rector of the university [[Tuure Lehén|T. I. Lekhen]] was among them.{{sfn|Zolina|1965|p=11}} In total 328 man left to the war.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=15}} The students and teachers made contribution to the struggle against the enemy not only at the battlefield but also in the [[Rear (military)|rear]] they worked at the [[factories]], built [[fortification]]s.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=15}}

At the end of the summer 1941 the front was approaching the city of [[Petrozavodsk]] (on October 1, 1941 Petrozavodsk was completely occupied by the Finnish army). The [[government]] decided to [[Emergency evacuation|evacuate]] the university. They were able to take a significant part of the university property to the town of [[Syktyvkar]] [[Komi Republic]]. The university continued its work there cooperating closely with the Komi pedagogical institute. In this difficult period the leadership of the PetrSU was carried by K. D. Mirtopolsky. Vice-rector of two universities was the rector of the pedagogical institute G. P. Balin.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=16}}

It should be noted that in spite of the hardships of the war the research activities did not cease, although some research topics have changed: now they were focusing on the needs of [[Arms industry|defense industry]], the tasks of the national economic development of the Northern region and an identifying the reserves for military needs. For example, scientists-geologists carried out the exploration of mineral resources in the Republic of Komi and the Urals, and the Department of [[Plant Physiology]] studied the [[Freeze thaw resistance|frost-resisting ability]] of [[potato]], the [[acclimatization]] of [[Nicotiana|tobacco]] and [[sugar beet]]s in the [[North]].{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=17}}

In June 1944 during the Svir-Petrozavodsk military operation there was the defeat of the [[Military occupation|invaders]] in the south of Karelia. On June 28 of that year soviet troops entered Petrozavodsk. In autumn the whole territory of Karelia was liberated. In June 1944 the government of the [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelo-Finnish SSR]] decided to return the university to Petrozavodsk. On July 30, 1944 the teachers with their families and students returned to Petrozavodsk from Syktyvkar. During the war the university building was destroyed, all remaining equipment and the library were destroyed. The students and the staff of the university had to make exert every effort on its reconstruction. In the reconstruction the leaders of the Karelian republic took an active part too. The number of teaching staff of the university increased thanks to the teachers who were returning from the front. The new school year 1944 started on October 2, and 242 students began to learn. In summer 1945 the university celebrated its fifth anniversary. In August 1945 in Petrozavodsk State University the new rector V. S. Chepurnov began his activity.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|pp=19-21}}

Hard time of the Great Patriotic War the university survived with dignity, it didn't stop its activity and on the contrary - it directed all the energies for the victory. Its students, teachers and collaborators were working hard and were fighting on the front and in the rear. Unfortunately, not all of them were able to live up to a happy [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]]. During the Great Patriotic War 90 students, teachers and collaborators were killed and were missing. The fate of 42 people is unknown.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=18}} But in spite of everything in the period from 1942 to 1945 years 65 students graduated from the university, among them there were one geographer, three geologists, six mathematicians, 21 biologists, 34 historians and philologists.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=17}}

=== Founding and development of PetrSU during 1950s-1960s ===

During the post-war restoration of the Karelian Republic there was a significant shortage of qualified personnel. To address that problem, the local government in cooperation with [[USSR Ministry of Higher Education]] decreed to expand the university's program in various fields, such us [[heavy industry]], [[civil construction]] and [[agriculture]].{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=78}}

In 1951, the technical engineering faculty was created, with V. S. Artamonov as dean. That faculty was training [[Forestry|forest engineer]]s, [[agriculturist]]s and [[Zootechnics|zootechnician]]s. In May 1954 that faculty was divided into two separate ones: the forest engineering faculty with the dean [[Alexey Lukashin|A. L. Lukashin]] and the geological prospecting faculty with the dean V. S. Artamonov. In 1956, the forest engineering faculty opened a night school branch for the workers and employees of the [[Onega Tractor Plant]].{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=78}}
The same year, the [[USSR Ministry of Geology]] saw inexpedient to continue training of geological prospecting specialists within the Karelo-Finnish University, so the last group of geologists graduated from there in 1960.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=79}}

In 1951, the physics and mathematics faculty and the biological faculty were suspended, and in their place the natural mathematics faculty was created, on which students learned math, biology and agriculture. In February 1954 that faculty was divided into two: the physics and mathematics faculty with the dean A. A. Raikerus and the natural faculty (renamed to agricultural in 1958) with the dean [[Maria Petrovna Mironova|M. P. Mironova]].{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=78}}

On October 8, 1956, the first issue of the large circulation newspaper "Petrozavodsk University" was published.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=87}} The content for the newspaper was being proposed by lecturers and students. The newspaper has a page on the university's website since 1996.{{sfn|Newspaper PetrSU}}

In 1957 the new rules for enrollment were issued, according to these rules the enrollees with at least two years [[work experience]] and [[ex-servicemen]] of the [[Soviet Army]] had an advantage. Shortly before that, the tuition fees were cancelled.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=79}}

In 1958, the university's faculties were assigned internship bases, according to the new law of linking the school to daily life.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=81}}

From 1957 to 1963, the enrollment to the [[Finnish language]] and literature majors of the History and Philology faculty was temporarily suspended, as the faculty underwent reformations.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=78-79}}

In 1960, the medical faculty was created. Initial yearly enrollment was up to 150 students for the day courses and 50 for the night courses (since 1961). [[Natalya Likhachova|N. B. Likhacheva]], the representative of Leningrad medical school, became the dean.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=79}}

[[File:Student on exam.jpg|thumb|left|Part-time student on the exam]]

In 1962, the general technology faculty was created (abbr. GTF, {{lang-ru|ОТФ}}). It consisted of four subjects: mechanics, construction, energetics and technical. The faculty also conducted [[night courses]] and [[correspondence courses]] in more than 50 disciplines in three years, after which the students were transferred into other engineering subjects within the university, or to other technical universities of the country.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=79}}

On June 16, 1964 by a decree of Central Committee of the USSR Communist Party and the USSR Council of Ministries the university was named after [[Otto Wille Kuusinen|O. V. Kuusinen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.karelia.ru/gov/Different/Dates/index.html?month=6 Calendar of important dates]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, from the construction discipline a new faculty of industrial and civil construction was created (abbr. ICC, {{lang-ru|ПГС}}) with professor [[Vladimir Kazin|V. V. Kazin]] as dean.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=79}}

Because of all these reformations, the university managed to become a source of wide-purpose qualified workforce, the income of new students increased considerably as well as the numbers of professors and lecturers. For example, in 1970 the university had 483 lecturers working in 47 departments, 30 of them being Ph.D. or professors, and 190 assistant professors. The final number of employees came to 529.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=79}}

In the 1950s and 1960s, extensive [[scientific research]] was being conducted within the university, for example, the students and professors of the History and Philology faculty actively participated in archeological, folklorist and linguistic expeditions, gathering valuable information on the history and culture of the [[native peoples]] of the republic. Thanks to the works of some historians, a large number of new documentary sources were unveiled to a wide range of readers.
The university's [[linguist]]s took part in assembling Russian-Finnish and Finnish-Russian [[dictionary|dictionaries]] (published in 1947, 1955, 1963). The [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM field]] scientists of the university also conducted valuable research and acquired particular results, such as developing methods of separation and analysis of optically active isomers of important biological compounds - [[amino acids]], [[Lipid|phosphatides]]; or studies into the [[Fatigue (material)|process of destruction of metals and alloys]] due to material fatigue.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=81-83}}

Within the same time period, the non-curricular student life was developing swiftly. In 1952, the university's theatrical studio was created by an [[Meritorious Artist|Honored Artist]] of Karelia, [[Yuri Alexandrovich Sungurov|Y. A. Sungurov]]. It staged [[Performance|various play]]s based on the works of [[Alexander Ostrovsky|A. Ostrovsky]], [[Lev Ivanovich Oshanin|L. Oshanin]], [[Aleksei Arbuzov|A. Arbuzov]], [[Bertolt Brecht|B. Brecht]], that were warmly welcomed by the viewers. At the same time, a Finnish dramatical club was created under the supervision of an Honored Artist of USSR and Karelia [[Toivo Lankinen|T. I. Lankinen]]. 1962 is the birth year of the [[university's academic choir]], led by [[G. E. Terazuyanets]]. In 1964, the [[tourist club]] "Sampo" was founded under the supervision of [[Yury Lanev|Y. S. Lanev]], to guide hundreds of students into the wild unknown during the years. In 1966, the [[International Friendship club]] "The Globe" was created, which conducted numerous events for establishing international academic connections. Special attention was also paid to the [[physical education]], various sports sections were created, of which the [[Ski-orienteering|skiing section]] was prevalent.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=87-88}}

During the period of 1951-1970, about 7 thousand specialists graduated from the university and were highly praised not only in Karelia, but overall.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=90}}

=== PetrSU in 1970-1985 ===
{{Spoken Wikipedia|En-PetrSU (part History 1970-1985).ogg|2016-04-24}}

Thanks to the coordinated efforts of university employees, the Karelian-Finnish State University's influence grew rapidly in Karelia and the European North.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=216}}

In 1973, [[Mikhail Shumilov]] became the new rector of the university. He had a PhD in History and was well known for his monographs about the history of Karelia and Northern Europe.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=216}}

In 1975, the Department of Accounting was opened in the university as a part of the School of Mathematics and Physics. The main impetus behind the opening of this department was the lack of qualified accountants and economists in Karelia. The first class of accounting students graduated in 1979 and consisted of 52 young specialists. In 1980, the School of Economics was opened. It consisted of three departments: political economy, accounting and economic activity, and sectorial economy. The first dean of the school was [[Sergey Polyakov (economist)|S. N. Polyakov]]. In 1982, he was replaced by [[Anatoly Rusakov|A. G. Rusakov]].{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=217}}

[[File:Entrants in the entrance exams.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Entrants in the entrance exams (in gym).]]

To increase the popularity of the University among prospective [[Abitur|students]], departments and schools of the University put a lot of effort in distributing information about the university in Karelia and neighboring areas.  Additionally, a number of special training courses (recruiting about 1,800 people) were organized. University teachers organized meetings with high school students where they talked about opportunities the students would get at the university. The so-called "Open Door Days"&lt;ref&gt;The special days when people can visit Departments of the University and to get information about University.&lt;/ref&gt; were organized regularly. As a result, competition for admission grew to about 2.3 students per available slot.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=217}}

Special attention was paid to improvement of the level of teacher qualification. Teachers now could take additional vacation to earn master and doctoral (PhD) degrees. The university had 40-50 graduate students each year.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=217}}

In 1970s special attention was also paid to the technical equipment of the university. Eight classrooms were equipped to display [[film|movies]] and two classrooms became language [[language lab|laboratories]]. Computer classrooms were also upgraded and the third generation computers [[ES EVM|ES-1022 and ES-1035]] were installed.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=218}}

PetrSU was one of the first universities that implemented an integrated program of the [[Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education of the USSR|USSR Ministry of Higher Education]] called "[[Industrial control system|ICS]]-university". To improve the work of the university, the university researchers developed a number of software systems including "Entrant", "Number of students", "Session", "Current control", "Social and political practice," "Graduate student," "Control of decision implementation", and "Human Resources Staff".{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=219}}

From the early 1970s to 1985, approximately 14,300 students graduated from the university.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=228}}

=== PetrSU in 1985-1990 ===
In the second half of the 1980s, system of higher education of [[Soviet Union]] was reorganized. 
In 1987,  the [[Central Committee of the CPSU]] and the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR]] published decrees, which said that university education was the most perfect form for organization and education of youth.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=332-333}}

In 1986, technical faculty was abolished within the framework of general changes in the university. Faculty of history and philology was divided into two independent faculties – philological and historical. The faculty of physics and mathematics was divided into the faculty of physics and the faculty of mathematics also.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=333}}

University management has always held the view that the education system had to be constantly improved, so in the second half of 1980 educational and work plans were revised, modified or supplemented in all faculties. In the training sessions the priority was given to active and creative mastery of the material. From this moment students have more time for independent work.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=334}}

In 1987, in the framework of the program aimed at continuous development of education, courses for improve of professional skills were created for leading workers of the national economy.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=335}}

In the second half of the 1980s, cooperation with foreign universities was expanded. Relations were established with the universities of the cities of [[Oulu]] and Kupio ([[Finland]]), [[Umeå]] ([[Sweden]]), [[Duluth]] ([[United States]]). There was an exchange of teachers and students between universities and PetrSU and also joint scientifics researches were conducted.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=339}}

In 1988, the construction of a new university building was started, called Drevlyanka, district of Petrozavodsk.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=340}}

During this period, public student deaneries, which dealt with issues related to the [[scholarship]] and extracurricular pastime of students, were created at the mathematical, physical, medical and biological faculties.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=340}}

Gang also collaborated with the UN University for Peace who helped plant the seeds to create the Global Alliance for Transforming Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steps toward a Global Education System See Steps toward Global Mind Control|url=http://www.crossroad.to/Books/BraveNewSchools/Chronology.htm|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was an important figure in popularizing the [[Montessori in the United States|Montessori schooling methods for use in the United States]].&lt;ref name=psg&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 1|url=http://chapters.scarecrowpress.com/15/788/1578866324ch2.pdf|publisher=Scare Crow Press|accessdate=2 March 2016}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s Dr. Gang took part in the Global Thinking Project. As a Citizen Diplomat he traveled to Russia and was in dialogue with teachers, principals and directors of the Soviet Academy. Most significant was the Siberian lecture on Ecology where he presented ''Our Planet Our Home''.&lt;ref name="HassardWeisberg1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jack Hassard|author2=Julie Weisberg|title=Environmental Science on the Net: The Global Thinking Project|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZPwiyxqEA0C&amp;pg=PA258|year=1999|publisher=Good Year Books|isbn=978-0-673-57732-0|pages=258–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Philip Snow Gang was the son of George and Fannie Gang. George owned Anoroc Products, manufacturing glass and aluminum for shower and patio doors, which he ran with Philip's brother Daniel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alumni Mag|url=https://issuu.com/gtalumni/docs/1962_41_1/30|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Mag|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gang attended Forest Hills High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Hills High School Class of 1958|url=http://www.e-yearbook.com/yearbooks/Forest_Hills_High_School_Forester_Yearbook/1958/Page_105.html|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Montessori Schooling Methods==
In 1967, Gang first came into contact with Montessori at the Ashdun Hall Montessori,&lt;ref name="Martin2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold H. Martin|title=Atlanta and Environs: A Chronicle of Its People and Events, 1940s-1970s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1pfjlqKhlMC&amp;pg=PA438|date=1 March 2011|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-3906-1|pages=438–}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first schools opened during the re-emergence of Montessori schools in the 60s in the United States.In 1973, Gang decided to move his family to Italy to study the Montessori Elementary Education Method at the Centro Internazionale Di Studi Montessoriani.&lt;ref name=gangw&gt;{{cite journal|last1=BETSY|first1=WHITE|journal=: The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution Page|title=Engineer changes gears, becomes educational pioneer|date=November 13, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he was trained by the Italians Eleanor Honegger and Camillo Grazzini, who delivered most lectures in a combination of Italian and English.&lt;ref name="gangw"/&gt;

==Founding TIES and Forming GATE==
Gang met Robert Muller, then Assistant Secretary of the UN, in 1984.&lt;ref name=wawas&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmos, Gaia and Spirit Symposium Presenter|url=http://earthties.org/cosmos-gaia-spirit-symposium-presenter/|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muller had previously released the "World Core Curriculum", and Gang noticed many similarities to Maria Montessori's cosmic education.&lt;ref name="wawas"/&gt; Muller collaborated with Gang to initiate the Global Alliance for Transforming Education, which was released in 1990. This initiative was set into motion with the 1990 publication of "The Chicago Statement on Education".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Ron. 1992. "Introducing Holistic Education: The Historical and Pedagogical Context of the 1990 Chicago Statement". Teacher Education Quarterly 19 (1). Caddo Gap Press: 5–13. https://www.jstor.org/stable/23475623.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1990, Gang is named Executive Director of the newly formed GATE (Global Alliance for Transforming Education), an initiative started with Ron Miller and Edward Clark,&lt;ref name="Schiller2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan A. Schiller|title=Sustaining the Writing Spirit: Holistic Tools for School and Home|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D63zAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10|date=25 February 2014|publisher=R&amp;L Education|isbn=978-1-61048-958-4|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and strongly influenced Miller. GATE also released "Education 2000: A Holistic Perspective"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Jack|title=HOLISTIC EDUCATION:  LEARNING FOR AN  INTERCONNECTED WORLD|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c11/e6-61-04-01.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1991, which offered ten principles of holistic education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rudge|first1=L|title=Holistic education: An analysis of its pedagogical application.

'''Post Leaving Certificate''' ('''PLC''') ([[Irish Language|Irish]]: '''Cúrsa Iar Ard-Teistiméarachta''') is an informal term for a large range of courses and qualifications run in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] for students who have finished their secondary education. The majority of students who enrol on a PLC course are under 23, but mature students are welcome as well. A Post Leaving Certificate course is taken after a student has passed their [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]], and is generally a one- or two-year course. PLC courses are aimed primarily at students who would like to develop vocational or technological skills in order to enter an occupation, or go on to [[higher education]].

==Administration==
The majority of Post Leaving Certificate courses are certified by the [[Further Education and Training Awards Council]] (FETAC), who also monitors the quality of the courses, and determines standards. FETAC does not however deliver the award programmes itself, these are generally left to the teaching institution themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fetac.ie/info/about_fetac.htm |title=About FETAC |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109092441/http://www.fetac.ie/info/about_fetac.htm |archivedate=9 January 2010 }} About FETAC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course structure==
PLC courses are usually full-time, and run for one or two years. They generally focus on practical work, academic basics, and [[work experience]] in a relevant industry. The majority of courses take place in Colleges/Institutes of Further Education, however they are increasingly being taught in private colleges, particularly in the [[Dublin]] area.

Courses offered include:
*Applied Sciences
*[[Art and Design]]
*[[Business Studies]]
*[[Electronics]]
*[[Computing]]
*[[Beauty Therapy]]
*[[Media Studies]]
*[[Office Administration]]
*[[Legal studies]]
*[[Marketing]]
*[[Childcare]] studies, [[Special Needs Assistant]] &amp; Supporting Learning in Schools etc.
*Health care support
*[[Security Studies]]
*Dental Nursing (see [[Dental Nurse]])

==Qualifications==
Qualifications vary from one institution to another, but a common certification is a FETAC level 5 Certificate or level 6 Advanced Certificate &amp; to a lesser extent a [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] [[Higher National Diploma]]/Higher National Certificate. Courses may also give awards certified by other qualification authorities such as the [[Royal Society of Arts]] (RSA) [[City &amp; Guilds]], [[Institute of Commercial Management]] BTEC/[[Edexcel]], the Irish Exporters Association &amp; [[Irish Training and Education Centre|ITEC]].    &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Queensland Teachers' Union''' is an Australian trade union with a membership of more than 44,000 teachers and principals in the Queensland Government's primary schools, secondary schools, special schools, senior colleges, TAFE colleges and other educational facilities. More than 96 per cent of eligible teachers are members. As well as protecting the rights and conditions of its members, the QTU also sees the promotion of public education as a major part of its role.

==History of the QTU==
The Queensland Teachers' Union was formed in January 1889, when seven regional teachers' organisations gathered at the [[Brisbane School of Arts|School of Arts in Brisbane]]. It is the oldest teachers' union in Australia and one of the oldest trade unions of any type in Queensland. In 1895, the QTU published the first issue of the Queensland Education Journal, later renamed the Queensland Teachers' Journal, which is now the oldest continuous teachers' journal in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Spaull and Sullivan. "A History of The Queensland Teachers' Union", Allen &amp; Unwin, 1989, p.331.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Public Service Association, the QTU lead the campaign for the establishment of a state public service superannuation scheme for Queensland, which eventually came into being in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Spaull and Sullivan. "A History of The Queensland Teachers' Union", Allen &amp; Unwin, 1989, p.116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1917, the QTU was granted registration as an industrial association in Queensland's new Arbitration Court, and in November of that year the Queensland Teachers Award became the first agreed in industrial arbitration processes anywhere in Australasia, and one of the first negotiated in an industrial tribunal anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Spaull and Sullivan. "A History of The Queensland Teachers' Union", Allen &amp; Unwin, 1989, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the Industrial Commission granted the QTU's application for equal pay for women teachers, something for which the union had been campaigning since 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Spaull and Sullivan. "A History of The Queensland Teachers' Union", Allen &amp; Unwin, 1989, p.280.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Remote Area Incentive Scheme, which tackles teacher shortages in the state's rural and remote areas by using incentives to attract and retain teachers, was introduced in 1990, after 16 years of QTU campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Education, Queensland and Queensland Teachers' Union. "Remote Area Incentives Scheme: The Report of the Joint Working Party". 1990, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent activity==
In 2010 the QTU, along with other Australian teacher unions, campaigned against the federal government's My School website, which publishes the NAPLAN test performance of schools and provides comparisons between schools.&lt;ref&gt;"NAPLAN breakthrough 'a win for common sense': QTU". www.abc.net.au, May 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, QTU members staged a national strike, the union's first in nine years, in support of a campaign for a salary increase.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Gray. "Queensland Teachers to be nation's best paid".www.couriermail.com.au.Nov 8 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, QTU members in remote areas of Queensland took strike action over what they regarded as the poor standard of housing supplied by The Department of Education and Training.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Odgers. "Teachers set to strike over Torres Strait Housing Row".www.couriermail.com.au. Aug 1 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the QTU established in collaboration with the [[Independent Education Union of Australia]] QLD branch, the working group "Teachers For Refugees and Asylum Seekers". This working group was established after the forced removal of  Yeronga State High Year 12 student Mojgan Shamslispoor to an immigration detention centre in Darwin. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = www.qtu.asn.au :: Teachers for Refugees and People Seeking Asylum|url = http://www.qtu.asn.au/index.php/member-groups/teachers-refugees-and-asylum-seekers/|website = www.qtu.asn.au|access-date = 2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teachers strike for refugee rights|url = https://redflag.org.au/node/5029|website = REDFLAG|access-date = 2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
All members have access to a QTU Union Rep, their first point of contact with the Union. They are serving teachers elected by their colleagues to represent the Union in the workplace.

All members also have access to a Union sub-branch and branch. The QTU has 99 branches, which cover every state school within their boundaries, as well as 30 TAFE branches. Each branch has two representatives on its local area council. There are 11 area councils across Queensland.

QTU State Council (which meets five times a year, except Conference years) and the QTU Biennial Conference (which meets once every two years) are the supreme decision making bodies of the Union. Each branch and area council is represented.

The QTU Executive manages union affairs between State Council meetings. It consists of 13 serving teachers elected by State Council and the union's senior officers: the President, Vice-President, Honorary Vice-President, General Secretary and two Deputy General Secretaries.

The President, Vice-President and Honorary Vice-President are elected by the members. They preside at meetings of Executive, Council and Conference and must implement their decisions. They also handle media and community relations. The General Secretary and the two Deputy General Secretaries are elected by State Council and have primary responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the Union.

The Union's headquarters are at Milton in Brisbane, and it has regional offices in Cairns, the Gold Coast, Maryborough, Rockhampton, the Sunshine Coast, Toowoomba and Townsville. The QTU has 12 regional organisers based around the state.

==Affiliations==
The QTU is not affiliated with any political party, nor does it donate funds to any political parties.  Under the QTU Constitution, political party affiliation could only occur after a referendum of all members. However, the QTU does reserve the right to support/oppose candidates (before and during election campaigns), depending on their attitude and actions in relation to QTU policy positions - in particular on public education and industrial relations. The QTU is affiliated with the [[Australian Education Union]], as well as the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] and the [[Queensland Council of Unions]], the peak Australian and Queensland union bodies.

The '''Sons and Daughters of Pioneer Rivermen''', or '''S&amp;D''', is an historical organization operating out of Marietta, OH. According to its website, it "was established in 1939 to perpetuate the memory of pioneer rivermen and for the preservation of river history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverhistory.org/|title=The S&amp;D Reflector|website=S&amp;D Reflector}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current president is Jeff Spear.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mariettatimes.com/page/content.detail/id/529955/Sons-and-Daughters-of-Pioneer-Rivermen-on-a-mission-to-educate-generations.html&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is under the direction of twelve governors, each serving a three year term, elected by the general voting body.  

S&amp;D established the [[Ohio River Museum]] in Marietta in 1941. Working under the auspices of the Ohio Historical Society, S&amp;D oversaw the addition of the steam towboat ''[[W. P. Snyder]]'' to the museum in 1955, as well as construction of a new museum facility in 1972. In cooperation with the [[Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County]], S&amp;D also established the Inland Rivers Library, a part of the PLCHC's Rare Books and Special Collections department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campusmartiusmuseum.org/river.html|title=Campus Martius – Marietta Museums|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S&amp;D publishes a quarterly [[house organ]] magazine entitled the ''S&amp;D Reflector'', first created and edited by [[Frederick Way, Jr.|Capt. Frederick Way, Jr.]], one of the founders of S&amp;D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mississippirivermuseum.com/features_halloffame_detail.cfm?memberID=57|title=MISSISSIPPIRIVERMUSEUM.COM|website=www.mississippirivermuseum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mississippirivermuseum.com/features_halloffame_detail.cfm?memberID=114|title=MISSISSIPPIRIVERMUSEUM.COM|website=www.mississippirivermuseum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[education in the Netherlands|Dutch education system]], '''particular education''' ("bijzonder onderwijs") refers to a separate category  of education distinct from both [[public]] and [[Private school|private]] education, in which a school is administered by an independent board, as opposed to a government authority, while still receiving government funding.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/vrijheid-van-onderwijs/openbaar-en-bijzonder-onderwijs|title=Openbaar en bijzonder onderwijs - Vrijheid van onderwijs - Rijksoverheid.nl|first=Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en|last=Wetenschap|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particular schools are comparable to the concept of a [[charter school]], with the additional characteristic of being grounded in a particular [[religious denomination]] or [[educational philosophy]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Particular education is not to be confused with "[[special education|speciaal onderwijs]]", which refers to schools specialized to deal with physical and/or learning disabilities.

== Definition ==
Particular schools differ from both public and private schools in the way they are funded and run. While privately run, particular schools are not altogether outside the control of the [[Education, Culture and Science of the Netherlands|Dutch Ministry of Education]], as they are subsidized on equal footing with public schools, and cannot charge [[tuition]] over the statutory rate. They are therefore also distinct from private schools—of which there are a small but increasing number in the country—which get no subsidies and can charge market tuition.

== Subcategories ==
Particular education can be further subdivided into two categories:
* '''Denominational Particular Education''' ("confessioneel bijzonder onderwijs") refers to schools grounded in a religious denomination, often founded by or linked to church boards or religious foundations. Examples of denominational schools are [[Christian]] schools, including [[Roman Catholic]], [[Evangelical]], and [[Dutch Reformed Church|Protestant Reformed]], as well as [[Islamic]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] schools. Denominational schools represent the majority of particular schools.
* '''General Particular Education''' ("algemeen bijzonder onderwijs") refers to a minority of particular schools not rooted in religion but operating on a particular  educational concept, such as [[The Dalton Plan|Dalton education]], [[Montessori education]], and [[Waldorf education]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rug.nl"&gt;http://www.rug.nl/education/scholierenacademie/scholieren/profielwerkstuk/alfasteunpunt/subjects/onderwerpen/godsdienst/scholen{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, classification is complicated by schools that combine aspects of denominational and general, as well as public and particular education, for instance schools that adhere to an educational philosophy while lacking an independent school board, and schools combining denominational and educational philosophy in their teaching.&lt;ref name="rug.nl"/&gt;

== History ==
The distinction between particular and public education arose from the hugely influential [[School struggle (Netherlands)|school struggle]], which dominated Dutch politics from the mid-19th century until the [[Pacification of 1917]], when public and religious schools were granted equal rights to government funding under [[Constitution of the Netherlands#.C2.A723: Freedom of education|article 23 of the Dutch constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/nederlandse-schoolstrijd-1806-1917/|title=Schoolstrijd in Nederland (1806-1917)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vorige.nrc.nl/krant/article1515431.ece|title=NRC|publisher=|access-date=2014-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015230103/http://vorige.nrc.nl/krant/article1515431.ece|archive-date=2014-10-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Since the post-World War II decline of the [[pillarization]] of Dutch society along ideological lines, and the rapid [[secularization]] of Dutch society, government funding of particular schools has in recent years become a topic of debate once again, with several political parties calling for an amendment or revoking of [[Constitution of the Netherlands#.C2.A723: Freedom of education|article 23 of the constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://napnieuws.nl/2011/10/28/laait-de-schoolstrijd-opnieuw-op/|title=Laait de schoolstrijd opnieuw op?|date=28 October 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, [[Sander Dekker]], the State Secretary for the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, proposed to the parliament to change the law on two aspects:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Het is maar wat je vrijheid van onderwijs noemt|url = http://www.nrc.nl/opinie/2015/07/02/het-is-maar-wat-je-vrijheid-van-onderwijs-noemt/|accessdate = 2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Not to demand that new schools are representing an ideological direction, such as a religion. New schools could be based on an idea for good education, for instance ICT-based education, green schools, or other innovative concept, as long as sufficient interest exists for such a system.
# To introduce a more severe quality control. Freedom of education should not be a license for bad educational systems.

'''Steve Pavlina''' (born April 14, 1971)&lt;ref name="meaning"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/06/the-meaning-of-life-intro/|title=The Meaning of Life:  Intro|publisher=stevepavlina.com|date=June 2005|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American self-help author, [[motivational speaker]] and [[entrepreneur]].  He is the author of the web site stevepavlina.com and the book ''Personal Development for Smart People''.

==Background==
Steve was born and raised in Los Angeles, the eldest of four kids. During his childhood, Steve went to a private Jesuit high school.&lt;ref name="meaning" /&gt;

On January 27, 1991 Pavlina was arrested for grand theft in [[Sacramento, California]] and given 60 hours of [[community service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://services.saccourt.com/indexsearchnew/CaseNumberList.aspx?SearchValues=PAVLINA,STEPHEN,MICHAEL,2277077|title=Public Case Access System|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}} ([http://www.freezepage.com/1386360585WKWYKUZYJK?url=http://services.saccourt.com/indexsearchnew/CaseNumberList.aspx?SearchValues%3DPAVLINA%2CSTEPHEN%2CMICHAEL%2C2277077 archive url])&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that this was the impetus he needed to turn his life around, he also claims that he was let off a much worse sentence owing to a mistake in the legal process.&lt;ref name="meaning" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/06/overcoming-depression/|title=Overcoming Depression|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to starting his [[personal development]] site, Pavlina founded [[Dexterity Software]], an independent computer game developer and publisher. He described in a blog post how he transitioned from one identity (as a game publisher, forum participant etc.) into a public speaker and self-help blogger, by removing shortcuts from his desktops and favorites, reducing his gamer-related contacts and obligations and e-mail and relationships so that he was surrounded by an environment that completely reinforced the new identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavlina|first=Steve|title=Environmental Reinforcement of Your Goals|work=Personal Development for Smart People|url=http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2004/12/environmental-reinforcement-of-your-goals/|date=2004-12-15|accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Pavlina served as [[Vice President]] of the [[Association of Software Professionals]] (ASP) in 1999&lt;ref name="ASP HoF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asp-shareware.org/membership/asphof.asp|title=ASP Hall of Fame|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[President]] of the ASP in 2000.&lt;ref name="ASP HoF"/&gt; By this stage, Steve's writings in the software development community were already having some impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_87/493-The-Indie-Guru|title=The Indie Guru|date=6 March 2007|work=The Escapist|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ASP's [[Hall of Fame]] page describes him as having had "a significant, lasting influence on others via his articles and postings".&lt;ref name="ASP HoF"/&gt;

In 2004, Steve Pavlina began a web site and [[blog]] dedicated to [[personal development]], StevePavlina.com ("Personal Development for Smart People").  Dexterity Software went dormant at this time and on October 31, 2006, Steve closed Dexterity Software in order (he said) to focus full-time on the website and blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/10/halloween-updates/|title=Halloween Updates|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevepavlina.com/dexterity.htm|title=Dexterity Software has closed|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526125449/http://www.stevepavlina.com/dexterity.htm|archivedate=26 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2008, [[Hay House]] published Pavlina's book ''Personal Development For Smart People''.  The book expands upon several topics featured on his blog.

==Personal development blog==
Pavlina's blog covers topics such as personal development and success; consciousness and courage; productivity, motivation and [[goal]] setting; career, wealth and business; and spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/category/personal-development/|title=Personal Development|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One well known trial he performed involved [[polyphasic sleep]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last1 = della Cava | first1 = Marco R. | title = When sleep is just a dream; Overstimulated Americans struggle to get quality rest | newspaper = USA Today | date = 2006-02-27 | pages = A1 | issn = 0734-7456 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/educate/college/healthscience/articles/20060305.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a related article on early rising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/ | title=How to Become an Early Riser | author=Pavlina, Steve | date=May 23, 2005 | accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing in the [[United Kingdom|British]] newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,,2003777,00.html | title=Rise and shine | author=Burkeman, Oliver | publisher=The Guardian | date=February 3, 2007 | accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/management/morning-manager/is-sleep-throwing-off-your-work-life-balance/article2256502/ | title=Is sleep throwing off your work-life balance? | author=Schacter, Harvey | publisher=The Globe and Mail (Canada) | date=2012-12-02 | accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/talk-of-the-day/is-there-a-battle-between-night-owls-and-early-birds/article_566b8e4e-1519-11e1-90b9-0019bb30f31a.html | title=Is there a battle between night owls and early birds in your family?| author=St. Amand, Amanda | publisher=stltoday.com (The #1 St Louis Website) | date=2011-11-22 | accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/story/2011-11-21/Can-you-become-a-morning-person-Yes-but-its-not-easy/51338980/1 | title=Can you become a morning person?

On December 15, 2010, Steve Pavlina released all the content he had created until that date (excluding his book Personal Development For Smart People), as well as all content that he would create in the future (unless explicitly specified) in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2010/12/releasing-my-copyrights/ | title=Releasing My Copyrights | author=Pavlina, Steve | date=December 15, 2010 | accessdate=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Pavlina inspired musician [[Ben Averch]] to write a song, "No Division", which was based on one of Steve's blog posts on meditation.&lt;ref name="meditation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/08/no-division/ |title=No Division |accessdate=2012-06-23|work=http://www.stevepavlina.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="averch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://averch.bandcamp.com/track/no-division |title=No Division, from Washington State by Ben Averch |accessdate=2012-06-23|work=http://averch.bandcamp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, actress [[Lindsay Lohan]] got a tattoo based on the "truth, love, power" triangle from Steve Pavlina's book, blogging an image from Pavlina's book representing the triangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://omg.yahoo.com/blogs/celeb-news/lindsay-lohan-explains-meaning-behind-her-tattoo-140035056.html|title=Lindsay Lohan Explains the Meaning Behind Her New Tattoo|date=16 October 2013|work=Yahoo Celebrity|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lindsaylohan.com/story/love-truth-power-my-new-tattoo/ Lindsay Lohan's blog "My New Tattoo"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Study Technology''', or '''Study Tech''', is a [[teaching method]] developed by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], founder of the [[Church of Scientology]].&lt;ref name=Harley/&gt; Study Technology is used by Scientologists as part of their training, and is also promoted outside the church by an affiliated corporation known as [[Applied Scholastics]], which presents Study Tech as a secular, universally applicable method to enhance the comprehension of any student, studying any topic. However, the method has many critics, including former teachers, claiming that the "technology" and associated schools are intrinsically linked with religious aspects of Scientology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Adams | first = Guy | title = The school at the centre of Cruise split; Insiders claim Katie Holmes filed for divorce to prevent the Church of Scientology educating her daughter | newspaper = Independent | date = July 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the methods are ineffective.&lt;ref name="Farleyclassroom" /&gt;

Hubbard wrote in a [[Scientology]] policy letter in 1972 that "Study Tech is our primary bridge to Society."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron (4 April 1972). ''Ethics and Study Tech'', Hubbard Communications Office Policy Letters.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Study Tech books include a two-page biography of Hubbard that does not mention his role in creating Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Robert Farley|title = Church tutors embrace methods|newspaper= Tampa Bay Times|date = May 20, 2007|url = http://www.sptimes.com/2007/05/20/Tampabay/Church_tutors_embrace.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]] said that Hubbard wrote the Study Tech materials to help people who joined Scientology with a low level of [[literacy]], and that the materials are used within the Church of Scientology “not to proselytize for the religion but to teach people how to read.”&lt;ref name=Walsh97&gt;{{cite news |title = Texts highlight scientology's role in education|work = Education Week Issue 3 Vol. 17|date = 1997-09-17|accessdate = 2015-11-06|last = Walsh|first = Mark|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1997/09/17/03hubb.h17.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
According to Study Tech, there are three barriers that prevent students from learning: "absence of mass", too steep a gradient, and the misunderstood word.  According to Hubbard, each barrier produces a [[Physiology|physiological]] response in the student such as yawning, or feeling bored or frustrated.&lt;ref name=Farleyclassroom&gt;{{cite news|author = Robert Farley|title = Scientology makes it in classroom door|newspaper = Tampa Bay Times|date = 20 May 2007|url = http://www.sptimes.com/2007/05/20/Worldandnation/Scientology_makes_it_.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802155614/http://www.sptimes.com/2007/05/20/Worldandnation/Scientology_makes_it_.shtml|archive-date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with L. Ron Hubbard's beliefs, the method denies the existence of psychiatric conditions, or any biological learning difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Palmer | first = Brian | title = Edu-netics | newspaper = [[Slate Magazine]] | date = September 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Study Tech materials claim that "absence of mass" is the idea that abstractions must be [[Visual communication#Visual aids|illustrated]] physically before they can be fully understood: learning about trains is accelerated if the student can see a train or a representation of one.  Scientology classrooms are equipped with modeling clay and "demo kits", small collections of everyday objects, such as corks, caps, pen tops, and paper clips. Modeling clay or the contents of such a kit are used to create a physical model of what is being studied, thereby giving the student "mass".&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;The Church of Scientology (2001). ''The Technology of Study: from the Scientology Handbook.'' Based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–11}} One of the course requirements for people learning to be Scientology trainers is to model in clay the premise of every paragraph in Hubbard's book, ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health|Dianetics]]''.&lt;ref name=Harley&gt;Harley, Gail M. and Kieffer, John (2009). "The Development and Reality of Auditing," in [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] (ed.). ''Scientology''. Oxford University Press, pp. 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Too steep a [[Learning curve|study gradient]]" occurs when the student tries to learn too quickly, in which case the teacher directs the student back to the point where he last demonstrated understanding.

The "misunderstood word" is what Hubbard called the "misunderstood definition or the not comprehended definition, the undefined word."&lt;ref name="Harley" /&gt; Scientology classrooms are supplied with different kinds of dictionaries, and students are directed to "find your misunderstood [word]."&lt;ref name="Farleyclassroom" /&gt; Yawning is taken as a physical sign that a student has misunderstood a word or concept.&lt;ref name="Farleyclassroom" /&gt;

Study Tech emphasizes the principle of "word clearing," an activity in which readers are asked to look up the meaning of words that they do not understand, and in turn look up unfamiliar words within the word’s definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Texts Highlight Scientology's Role in Education. |journal=Education Week |year=1997 |last=Walsh |first=Mark |volume=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reader next is instructed to make up sentences of their own which use the word.{{r|Handbook|p=18}} This is a common method of teaching vocabulary. Word clearing is not to be confused with the Scientology concept of [[clear (Scientology)|the state of Clear]].

== Application ==
According to the ''[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]'', as of 1991, there were 150 schools using Study Tech worldwide including in Australia, several European countries, South Africa, and the United States. Supporters say the schools achieve good results and are "drug-free", though this is mostly referring to psychiatric drugs. Several Florida Study Tech schools have been discredited for this hard-line anti-psychiatric approach.&lt;ref name="foreign"&gt;{{cite news | last = Krueger | first = Curtis | title = Scientology's children: On education | newspaper = St. Petersburg Times | location = Florida | date = 11 November 1991 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/tampabay/access/50673594.html?dids=50673594:50673594&amp;FMT=ABS | accessdate = April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the United States, the method is used by [[Delphi Schools]], which runs a number of primary, middle, and secondary schools, and [[New Village Academy]], a private school in [[Calabasas, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Chris Ayres|title = A school that deserves to avoid cult status|newspaper= The Times|date =  1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials from the program were accepted as "supplementary texts" (i.e. not mandatory, but allowed) by the California Department of Education, as they were found not to mention religion. Before approval, minor modifications were required to include more women, people of color, and disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Hubbard Texts Approved for School Use|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/29/local/me-17431|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 1997-07-29|access-date = 2015-11-09|issn = 0458-3035|language = en-US|first = DUKE|last = HELFAND}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials were, however, criticized by a number of experts; for example for the practice of "word clearing" was criticized as not being appropriate to all levels of reading skill, and for being a subtle way to advance religious practice of [[Clear (Scientology)|clearing technology]]. Experts also criticized the inclusion of religiously loaded use of words like "mass", "gradient" and "demo kit".&lt;ref name=Walsh97 /&gt; As of 1998, it was being used in 26 cities by the Scientology-supported [[World Literacy Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Enzo | last = Di Matteo | title = Scientology wants city's kids | newspaper = [[Now (newspaper)|NOW Magazine]] |id= Vol. 18, No. 15|pages= 22, 24, 36| date = 10 December 1998|url= http://www.nowtoronto.com/archive/view_issue.cfm?vol=18&amp;num=15&amp;year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Study technology was used extensively at the [[Mace-Kingsley Ranch School]], a Church of Scientology-affiliated private ranch school for teenagers in a rural ranch environment. There are several documented complaints of abuse and neglect, including students being lied to about the academic value of Study Tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Scientology/Miscellaneous/meagan-porpora.html|title=Meagan Porpora at Scientology's Mace-Kingsley Ranch|author=|date=|website=www.cs.cmu.edu|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Literacy, Education and Ability Program (LEAP) of [[Memphis, Tennessee]], an Applied Scholastics member organization, received a grant of $250,000 from the U.S. government's Fund for the Improvement of Education (FIE) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;sid=cp1083xOTt&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr792.108&amp;db_id=108&amp;item=&amp;sel=TOC_3611258&amp; Committee Reports, 108th Congress (2003-2004), House Report 108-792], Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Scientology partnered with the [[Nation of Islam]], the Glorious Church of God in Christ in [[Tampa, Florida]], and Joy Tabernacle Cathedral in [[Ybor City]]. These groups adopted Study Tech, and their community support volunteers were trained in using Study Tech to teach children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Robert Farley|title = Scientology awards reach out to black community|newspaper= St. Petersburg Times|date =18 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = A curious alliance|newspaper = St. Petersburg Times|date = 9 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2012 the [[Pinellas County School Board]] revoked the Life Force Arts and Technology Charter School's charter after students there scored lowest or second-lowest on standardized test results when compared with hundreds of other schools in the Tampa Bay area. Teachers blamed new school management's implementation of Study Tech curriculum for poor test results; the curriculum was not approved by the school board, which in part caused the charter to be revoked. School staff complained that their colleagues had been fired for rejecting Scientology's teachings, and that teachers even worked after school, without pay, to try and assist children, with no substantial results.&lt;ref name=TBT12&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harwell|first1=Drew|title=FCAT scores at Pinellas charter school that used Scientology 'study tech' are among lowest in Tampa Bay|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/testing/fcat-scores-at-pinellas-charter-school-that-used-scientology-study-tech/1232114|accessdate=10 November 2015|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Harwell | first = Drew | title = Life Force Scores Suffer | newspaper = Tampa Bay Times | pages = 1A | date = May 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Study Tech was introduced in September 2008 at Bambolino [[Montessori method|Montessori]] Academy, a private school in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada; the school's principal and dean said that the method is secular and that they do not teach Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/09/18/bambolino-school.html |title=Scientology link at Montessori school alarms parents |date=18 September 2009 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923044223/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/09/18/bambolino-school.html |archivedate=September 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2012 Toronto, as well as [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Nevada]] had backed away from supporting Study Tech, after numerous complaints from educators and parents.&lt;ref name="florida"&gt;{{cite news | last = Harwell | first = Drew | title = Charter School's Troubling Twists | newspaper = Tampa Bay Times | pages = 1A | date = February 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Elsewhere in the world, Applied Scholastics received accreditation from the [[Italian Ministry of Education]] in 2005 as an organization that teachers can choose to attend for their continuing education requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedscholastics.org/Italian_Accreditation/index.php|title=Applied Scholastics International - Study Technology to Overcome Any Learning Problem|author=|date=|website=www.appliedscholastics.org|accessdate=11 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206225204/http://appliedscholastics.org/Italian_Accreditation/index.php|archivedate=6 December 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pubblica.istruzione.it/docenti/documenti/accreditati/elenco/schede/a_b_enti_accreditati_schede.htm#ba17|title=Details on the Ministry of Education site|author=|date=|website=istruzione.it|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monika Schipmann of the Berlin Education Department told the ''St. Petersburg Times'' in 1991 that the authorities there considered Study Tech to be "psychologically damaging."&lt;ref name="foreign" /&gt;

* According to Janet Reitman, based on the Study Tech principle that "it's possible to teach oneself anything simply by following Hubbard's core precepts, there is often no actual "teaching" in Scientology schools. She also mentions that the Delphi schools utilizes the services of many teachers who have only received accreditation from the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reitman |first1=Janet |title=Inside Scientology |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2011 |accessdate=2018-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4308">The '''UNESCO King Sejong Literacy Prize''' is an annual prize awarded to two institutions, organizations or individuals "for their contribution to the fight against illiteracy."

It is funded by the Government of the '''[[Republic of Korea]]''' which first offered the Prize in 1989, honouring the outstanding contribution made to '''[[literacy]]''' by [[Sejong the Great]] who created the Korean alphabet [[Hangul]]. The Prize specialises from other UNESCO Literacy Prizes that "it gives special consideration to the development and use of mother-tongue literacy education and training."

Each award consists of a sum of US $20,000, a silver medal and a certificate.

The '''University of Luxembourg''' (Luxembourgish: ''Universitéit vu Lëtzebuerg''; French: ''Université du Luxembourg'') is a [[Public university|public]] [[research university]] with an international, multilingual and interdisciplinary character, situated on Belval Campus and in [[Luxembourg City]], [[Luxembourg City|Luxembourg]].

Founded in 2003, the university has already built a reputation as being among the best young universities in the world. It was ranked 11th in the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings|Times Higher Young University Rankings]] 2017, and 178th in the Times Higher World University Rankings 2016.

The University offers many bilingual and multilingual study programmes in French, English and German, as well as several master courses and doctoral schools entirely taught in English. With 6,200 students from 120 countries and 250 academics from all over the globe, the university provides a cosmopolitan learning experience. Moreover, all Bachelor's students have to spend a mandatory semester abroad, reflecting the importance attached to mobility. The University therefore cooperates with nearly 90 partner universities worldwide.

The University of Luxembourg has three faculties, including the '''Faculty of Science, Technology and Communication''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwwen.uni.lu/fstc|title=Faculty of Science, Technology and Communication|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Faculty of Law, Economics and Finance''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwwen.uni.lu/fdef|title=Faculty of Law, Economics and Finance|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Faculty of Language and Literature, Humanities, Arts and Education''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwwen.uni.lu/flshase|title=Faculty of Language and Literature, Humanities, Arts and Education|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as three interdisciplinary research centres: the '''Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb|title=Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''',''' the '''Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt|title=Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the '''Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;DH)'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwwen.uni.lu/c2dh|title=Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research priorities are computational sciences and ICT, systems biomedicine, European law, international finance and educational sciences.

As one of the most international universities in Europe, the University of Luxembourg maintains close relations with EU institutions and participates in the debate on Europe's future. As a motor of the national research and innovation system, the University also gives strong support to entrepreneurial activities and is closely connected to Luxembourg's industry and the country's multicultural community, with an aim to support the creation of a knowledge-based society.

==History==

The University of Luxembourg or Université du Luxembourg in French, was officially founded in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwwen.uni.lu/university/about_the_university|title=About the University|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the passing of the Higher Education Act. Four separate institutions are combined into the « Université du Luxembourg »The establishment of the country’s first and only public university was a response to calls for an economic reorientation of the Grand Duchy.

Luxembourg moved from being a steel producer to become a globally significant financial centre in the 1980s and today it is an international innovation hub. The Government strategy put research, development and higher education as the cornerstone of economic diversification, competitiveness and creating a knowledge-based society. Therefore, the Government agreed to encourage the establishment of scientific and technological centres of excellence, concentrating efforts on a limited number of state-of-the-art sectors with an international dimension and a benefit to the country at large.

While Luxembourg’s students traditionally went to study abroad, the new university offers now the opportunity to access higher education at home. Furthermore, the University of Luxembourg attracts foreign students, researchers and intellectual potential to the country.

The first rector of the University of Luxembourg, the Canadian Prof. François Tavenas, passed away in February 2004, only a few weeks after he assumed the post. In 2005, the physicist Rolf Tarrach takes over the young university and presents the institution’s first strategic framework for the next four years. Several new Bachelor programmes start in autumn. End of 2005, the government decides about the future site of the University: the administration, the Science Faculty and the Humanities Faculty shall find a new home on the Belval [[brownfield land|brownfield site]] in the future "Cité des Sciences".

2009 is another turning point for the University, as the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) and the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB) are founded. The House of Biomedicine – the first building of the University in Esch-Belval housing the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB) – is inaugurated in 2011. In 2015, the University management, central administration and the Faculty of Language and Literature, Humanities, Arts and Education move to the brand new Belval Campus, the new headquarters of the University - a symbol of the country's vision to invest in high-quality public research as a major contribution to Luxembourg's economic future. In 2016, the University launches its third interdisciplinary research centre, the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;DH).

==Research==
[[File:University of Luxembourg - Kirchberg Campus.jpg|thumb|Campus Kirchberg and surrounding area]]

As a research-oriented university, the University of Luxembourg focuses on a select number of research areas of international importance, which also reflect the realities of Luxembourg's society and economy. Current strategic research priorities (2014-2017) are computational sciences and ICT, systems biomedicine, European law, international finance and educational sciences.

The international research teams and about 640 PhD students work in three faculties and three interdisciplinary centres:

* Faculty of Science, Technology and Communication
* Faculty of Law, Economics and Finance
* Faculty of Language and Literature, Humanities, Arts and Education 
* Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT)
* Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB)
* Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;DH)

1,096 scientific publications, of which 566 in refereed journals, were published in 2015. Corporate supporters have endowed nine academic chairs since 2006. Examples include the SES Chair in Satellite Communications and Media Law, the ArcelorMittal Chair in Steel and Façade Engineering, and the Deutsche Bank Chair of Finance. In 2015, total third party funding amounted to 41.4 million euros.

31 approved Horizon 2020 grants since 2014 (success rate: 16%) as well as four grants from the European Research Council (ERC) and are further milestones.

'''External evaluation'''

In the framework of the University's third external evaluation, evaluators have awarded the University of Luxembourg excellent marks for its research and for the institution's development phase. The four-year-cycle procedure stipulated in the university law has been conducted for the third time in 2016 and its results have been presented in February 2017 by the government.

The research evaluation represents the first comprehensive quantitative and qualitative examination of the University's overall research performance from 2012 to 2015. The evaluators confirmed that nine out of the 13 research units and interdisciplinary research centres ”enjoy a leading international role". Those are the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) and the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB), as well as the Research Centres for Physics and Material Sciences, Computer Science and Communications, Mathematics and Law and the Centre for Research in Economics and Management (CREA) as well as the Identités, Politiques, Sociétés, Espaces (IPSE) research unit and the Integrative Research Unit on Social and Individual Development (INSIDE).

According to the experts, seven of the 13 research units have acquired significant third-party funding, primarily from the National Research Fund (FNR) and the EU Commission. In particular, the evaluators emphasised the University's international character and its contribution to Luxembourg's society. The report also highlights the first-class working conditions at the University, the highly motivated and eminently qualified researchers, the strategic focus on a few core research fields as well as the outstanding national and international networking and cooperation.

==Admission and financial aid==
All applications must be submitted online via the University's Website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwwen.uni.lu/|title=University of Luxembourg|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enrolment fee is generally 400 euros in semesters 1 and 2 and 200 euros for all other semesters. (Special tuition fees for some Master programmes). The University has no additional tuition fees for foreign students.

'''European Investment Fund Guarantee for Students'''

In cooperation with the European Investment Fund and under the auspices of the European Commission, the University of Luxembourg has put in place a special scheme to support students for specific programs; this scheme includes some of the following:

'''Faculty of Science, Technology and Communication (FSTC)'''
* Master Professionnel en Sciences de l’Ingénieur - Efficacité Énergétique et Économique &lt;ref&gt;https://wwwfr.uni.lu/formations/fstc/master_professionnel_en_sciences_de_l_ingenieur_efficacite_energetique_et_economique&lt;/ref&gt;
* Master in Information and Computer Sciences
* Master of Science in Engineering - Sustainable Product Creation &lt;ref&gt;https://wwwen.uni.lu/formations/fstc/master_of_science_in_engineering_sustainable_product_creation_academique&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Faculty of Law, Economics and Finance (FDEF)'''
* Master in Logistics and Supply Chain Management
* Master in Wealth Management
* Master in Entrepreneurship and Innovation
* Master of Science in Banking and Finance
Within this supporting scheme, the University enables students to defer payment of some aspects of tuition fees or student housing during their master studies. This scheme is reserved to incoming master students at the University of Luxembourg who obtained a bachelor in a foreign university.

==Campuses ==
The University is located on different campuses in Luxembourg, including Belval Campus, Kirchberg Campus and Limpertsberg Campus.

The new headquarter of the University of Luxembourg, called Belval Campus, is built on industrial wasteland in the south of the country. The “Cité des Sciences” (City of Science) is Belval's lead project. Its first phase has had a budget of 960 million euros for the construction and fitting of more than a dozen new buildings on the grounds of the former blast furnace site. It is the location of the main University campus since the summer of 2015, hosting currently approximately 3000 students and 1000 employees (April 2017). Eventually, around 7,000 students and 3,000 teaching staff and researchers will be at work there.

As Belval Campus is a melting pot of different academic subjects, there are plenty of new opportunities for interdisciplinary partnerships, not only within the University but also with the public research institutes the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) and the Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER), both of which are located in the immediate neighbourhood.

Campus Limpertsberg lies in a residential district of the capital in a historic building built in 1903 on behalf of the Franciscan Order and it was used as a college for Catholic priests from 1926 to 1972. Currently the building partially hosts the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Economics and Finance and the Faculty of Science.

Campus Kirchberg is situated in a building complex formerly known as the “Institut Supérieur de Technologie” of the European Union in Kirchberg's banking district and it accommodates partially the Faculty of Science and Technology and the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust.

Bâtiment K2, situated near Campus Kirchberg hosts the “Luxembourg School Finance” and the “Luxembourg Business Academy”.

The Weicker Building situated at Rue Alphonse Weicker in Luxembourg-Kirchberg, accommodates the “Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust”, and partially the Faculty of Law, Economics and Finance.

A new campus will be built on the Kirchberg plateau in Luxembourg City in the coming years, including parts of the Faculty of Law, Economics and Finance, together with the Max Planck Institute Luxembourg for International, European and Regulatory Procedural Law.

== Programmes and courses ==
The university currently offers twelve Bachelor's programmes, 42 Master's programmes, seven Doctoral schools as well as 13 vocational training and lifelong learning courses (April 2017). PhDs can also be done in cooperation with industry. Joint supervision of dissertations with other institutions of higher education abroad is also possible.

About 860 financial experts, EU officials, managers, engineers, lawyers and other practitioners assist our 250 professors and senior lecturers in their teaching. Morevover, students benefit from the personal atmosphere at the University. Tutoring is offered to the majority of 1st year Bachelor's students and teaching in small groups gives lecturers the opportunity and time to give individual guidance.

==Student life==
At the end of 2016, about 6200 students were enrolled (3,000 Bachelor, 1,500 Master, 640 PhD, 1,000 others). The University entails a Student department (Service des Études et de la Vie Étudiante – SEVE) helping applicants and students with all the necessary steps, from orientation and registration to mobility, graduation, career service and beyond.

===Student mobility===

All Bachelor's students have to spend a mandatory semester abroad. The University therefore cooperates with nearly 90 partner universities in Europe and worldwide. Outgoing students must enrol and earn at least 30 ECTS. The ECTS earned abroad are recognized by the course director on the basis of the previously signed learning agreement.

Moreover, the University offers a special global exchange programme dedicated to Bachelor's and Master's students. As the available spots are limited, students are selected on the basis of their application file and a personal interview.

Students from foreign universities wishing to study for a semester or two at the University of Luxembourg are more than welcome. Incoming exchange students can spend either one or two semesters under an Erasmus exchange programme, with an inter-university agreement or as a fee paying student (freemover).

===Housing===

The University has 35 student residences with more than 1000 rooms and studios in several towns, including the City of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Noertzange, Obercorn, Mondercange and Dudelange. The average monthly rent for a furnished single room with common kitchen and bathroom is 360 euros, charges included (April 2017).

===Language centre===

The University of Luxembourg has gained a recognition for its multilingual teaching as one of the distinguishing features with the majority of the courses given in at least two languages; French and English or French and German. The University's Language Centre supports students who need to acquire the necessary language skills. It also offers good conditions for the students, like equipped laboratories and common study areas with affordable tuition fees.

===Campus art and campus sport===

The University offers a series of art workshops as well as a broad range of sport activities for students and staff. All courses are free of charge.

===Career service===

For students in their final semester and graduates, the University's Careers service “Campus Carrières” offers job application workshops, CV checks, a skills assessment, and a student job web portal. Furthermore, the career service provides students with individual advice on transitioning from studies to professional life and organises the annual recruitment fair ”unicareers.lu”.

===Cultural activities in Luxembourg===

Luxembourg, one of the founding states of the European Union, is one of the most intercultural and international societies in the world, with over 170 nationalities living together. Almost 70% of the residents of the cosmopolitan capital are non-Luxembourgers and, nearly half of the entire population (46.7%) are non-locals. Multilingualism is an integral part of Luxembourgish culture. There are plenty of leisure activities in the country, including cinemas, bike trails, excursion trails and a wide range of cultural activities, like jazz concerts, contemporary art expositions at MUDAM, theater in many languages or classical music concerts in one of the most beautiful buildings of Luxembourg City, the Philharmonie. All this is set in the romantic backdrop of the medieval city centre of Luxembourg (UNESCO world heritage site since 1994). There is a lively scene around the fashionable bars of Hollerich, Grund and Calusen in the capital, or the Rockhal and the Kulturfabrik in Esch-Alzette.

== Public services ==
===Public conferences===

The University organises various public conference series and round-table debates designed for a wide public, including, for example, the inaugural lectures series or the scientific series “Les Jeudis des Sciences”.

===Library===

The [https://wwwen.uni.lu/library university library], which can also be used free of charge by external readers, offers more than 220,000 books and nearly 1000 periodicals for teaching and research. These collections are completed by a wide range of electronic documentation consisting of databases, scientific articles and e-books. The www.a-z.lu catalogue provides access to all paper and electronic collections. The university library cooperates closely with the National Library and is a member of the BiBnet.lu network.

===Senior guest auditors===

More and more senior citizens use their time to continue studies and maintain intellectual capacities. A selection of lectures is geared towards this group, organised by the University of Luxembourg in consultation with the “RBS Center fir Altersfroen”. These lectures cover fields ranging from philosophy to psychology, and from Latin to history. Persons interested to register as a senior guest auditor, should follow admission instructions on the website of the university (www.uni.lu &gt; Students/Application).

'''Zelia Ball Page''' (1850-1937) was a freeborn [[African-American]] teacher who spent her career teaching black youths in Missouri, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Her husband was the first head of [[Langston University]] and she was the first matron.

==Early life==
