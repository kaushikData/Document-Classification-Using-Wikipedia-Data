An '''āb anbār''' ({{lang-fa|آب انبار}}, literally "[[water reservoir]]") is a traditional [[reservoir]] or [[cistern]] of drinking water in [[Greater Iran]] in antiquity.

== Structure ==

To withstand the pressure the water exerts on the containers of the storage tank, the storage itself was built below ground level. This also provides resistance to earthquakes. Many cities in Iran lie in a region that has been affected by very large earthquakes. Since almost all ab anbars are subterranean structures capped barely above ground level, they inherently possess stable structures.

The construction material used for ab anbars were very tough and extensively used a special mortar called ''[[sarooj]]'' which was made of sand, clay, egg whites, lime, goat hair, and ash in specific proportions, depending on location and climate of the city. This mixture was thought to be completely water impenetrable. The walls of the storage were often 2 meters thick, and special bricks had to be used. These bricks were especially baked for ab anbars and were called ''Ajor Ab anbari''. Some ab anbars were so big that they would be built underneath [[caravanserais]] such as the ab anbar of Haj Agha Ali in [[Kerman]]. Sometimes they would also be built under mosques, such as the ab anbar of Vazir near [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]].

The bottom of the storage tanks were often filled with metals for various structural reasons. The 18th century monarch [[Agha Muhammad Khan]], is said to have extracted the metals from the bottom of the Ganjali Khan public baths to make bullets for a battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karim Pirnia|Pirnia, M.K.]], ''Memari e Islami e Iran''. {{ISBN|964-454-093-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage tank ==
[[File:Sardar Bozorg ab anbar.jpg|thumb|right|Ab anbar of Sardar-i Bozorg, in Qazvin, is the largest single domed ab anbar in Iran.]]
Some ab anbars had storage space tanks that were rectangular in design, such as in [[Qazvin]], as opposed to cylindrical designs in Yazd.&lt;ref name="See p p187-197"&gt;See p. 193 of: Memarian, Gholamhosein. ''Asar: Memari-ye ab anbar haye shahr e Qazvin''. Vol 35. Miras Farhangi publications. Tehran. p187-197&lt;/ref&gt; There were several designs for the arched roof of the storage spaces of each ab anbar, namely ''ahang'', ''kalanbu'', ''kazhāveh'', or combinations of these depending on the features of the storage space.

In the particular example of Sardar-e Bozorg ab anbar in Qazvin, the storage space was built so large that it became known as the largest single domed ab anbar of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Hazrati, Mohammad Ali. ''Qazvin: ayinah-yi tarikh va tabi’at-i Iran''. Sazeman-i Irangardi va Jahangardi publications. Qazvin. 1382 (2003). {{ISBN|964-7536-35-6}} p.81&lt;/ref&gt; Doming the square plan was not an easy task, yet dome construction was not something new to these architects as is evident from the numerous domed masterpieces such as [[Soltaniyeh]].

Some sources indicate that the architects would first construct the storage space and then fill it up with hay and straw all the way up to where they could start constructing the dome. After finishing the dome, the straw would be set on fire, hence clearing the space inside. However holes can be seen in the walls of many storage spaces where scaffolding perhaps may have been used.

A storage space with a rectangular plan is much harder to dome than a circular one. It is not known why architects in particular places chose rectangular or circular layouts, considering that cylindrical spaces were easier to cover, and were deemed more hygienic for water storage due to lack of any corners in the space.&lt;ref name="See p p187-197" /&gt; Cylindrical tanks also had the advantage of experiencing homogenous forces throughout the walls caused by earth pressures, as opposed to the rectangular designs. Rectangular plans however have the advantage of containing larger volumes of water within rectangular property limits.  Examples of ab anbars with a square plan include the Sardar-e Bozorg ab anbar in Qazvin by [[Sardar Hosein Qoli Khan]] Qajar and his brother [[Hasan Khan Qajar]] Some required columns to be built inside the storage space. The Sardar e Kuchak ab anbar in Qazvin for example, uses a massive column in the center that splits the space up into four 8.5 X 8.5 meter contiguous spaces, each separately domed.  The Zananeh Bazaar ab anbar of Qazvin e.g. uses 4 columns inside its storage tank. The Seyed Esmail ab anbar in [[Tehran]] for example, is said to have had 40 columns.

== Access ==

In order to access the water, one would go through the entrance (''sar-dar'')  which would always be open, traverse a stairway and reach the bottom where there would be faucets to access the water in the storage. Next to the faucet would be a built-in seat or platform, a water drain for disposing water from the faucet, and ventilation shafts. Depending on where (i.e. what depth) the faucets would be, the water would be colder or warmer. Some storages would have multiple faucets located at intervals along the stairway. Thus nobody had direct access to the body of water itself, hence minimizing possible contamination. The storage compartment is completely isolated from the outside except for ventilation shafts or windcatchers. To further minimize contamination, the storage tank’s interior was scattered with a salty compound that would form a surface on top of the water. The storage tank would then be monitored year round to ensure that the surface had not been disturbed. The water of course would be drawn from the bottom using the pasheer.&lt;ref&gt;Pirnia, M.K., ''Memari e Islami e Iran''. {{ISBN|964-454-093-X}} p.214&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diolafoi Haj Kazem.jpg|thumb|right|The ''sar-dar'' of the ab anbar of Haj Kazem in [[Qazvin]], as sketched by French explorer Dieulafoy in the mid-1800s.]]
In some ab anbars, such as in Qazvin, the stairway and storage would be constructed adjacently alongside each other, whereas in Yazd the storage and stairway often had no structural connections to each other and the stairway was positioned independently.

The number of steps would depend on the capacity of the storage. The Sardar-e Bozorg ab anbar, for example, has 50 steps that would take the user to a depth of 17&amp;nbsp;m below grade. Nabi mosque ab anbar had 36 steps, Haj Kazem 38 steps, Jame’ mosque 35 steps, and Zabideh Khatun with 20 steps (all these are in Qazvin). To provide a brief relief when traversing the steps, there would be one to three landings built midway into the stairway. All stairways are linear.

The person responsible for filling the ab anbars (both private and public) was someone called a meerab. In effect, he was responsible for distributing the kariz network at various times. If a house wanted its ab anbar filled, they would ask the meerab to open up the kariz to their ab anbar. An overnight appointment would be enough to fill a typical house ab anbar. The ab anbar would also have to be cleaned once a year from settled sediments.&lt;ref&gt;Pirnia, M.K., ''Memari e Islami e Iran''. {{ISBN|964-454-093-X}} p.316&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sar-dar ==

The Sardar (سردر) is an arched entrance that descends down into the ab anbar. It contains platforms built-in for pedestrians and a resting area after ascending out of the stairway. It is decorated and has inscriptions with poetry and the date of construction.

== Windcatchers ==

Ab anbars in Iran are known to have used anywhere from one to six [[windcatcher]]s. Qazvin’s ab anbars however, do not frequently use windcatchers like in other parts of Iran, perhaps because of climatic conditions; Qazvin has very cold winters and mild summers, unlike Yazd. Most of Qazvin’s ab anbars are only equipped with ventilation shafts or semi-windcatchers. Ab anbars in Yazd, Kashan, Naeen, and other hot climate cities of Iran on the other hand extensively use windcatchers for cooling and ventilation purposes.

The way windcatchers work is that the moving air masses (wind, breeze, etc.) at the top of windcatchers create a pressure gradient between the top of the windcatcher and its base, inside, at the bottom of the shaft. This pressure gradient sucks out rising hot air from inside the shaft while the colder dense air remains. The superb heat-resistant material of the walls of the ab anbar further create an insulating effect that tends to lower the temperature inside an ab anbar, similar to a cave. The ventilating effect of the windcatchers prevent any stagnant air and hence any dew or humidity from forming inside, and the overall effect is pure, clean, cold water all year round.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2429">'''Angelfish''' is a UK [[charitable organization|charity]]{{Fact|date=August 2008}} that seeks to help disabled and deprived children in [[Cambodia]] by [[physical therapy]]. Angelfish uses a swimming programme to improve children's mobility and confidence. This is important in Cambodia which has the highest percentage of amputees in the world. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Handicap International |url=http://www.handicap-international.org.uk/page_170.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20041028164245/http://www.handicap-international.org.uk/page_170.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2006, the charity is run by volunteers who co-ordinate the project, organize fundraising events and seek out business sponsorship.

Each year, Angelfish aims to take Cambodian children to a water park where they will be supervised in the pool while exercising, receive a free hot lunch, and play games, while also having the opportunity to practice English. One of the major benefits of water therapy is freedom of movement without the usual disability aids that the children need. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Aquatherapy, The National Center on Physical Activity and Disability | url = http://www.ncpad.org/newsletter/newsletter.php?letter=23&amp;section=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers from the UK and local Cambodians will be involved in the project. Local instructors will be trained so that the project becomes more self-sufficient.

In August 2008 the pilot project will run in the Phnom Penh water park to establish the feasibility of the programme and how to improve it for the following year.

The charity has teamed up with The Rabbit School and NASCO Orphanage, both in [[Phnom Penh]], who have pledged their support to the project. Angelfish is also working with [[Handicap International]] (Belgium) and  The Cambodia Trust &lt;ref&gt; http://www.cambodiatrust.org.uk/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundraising activities include an annual swimming gala in [[Cambridgeshire]] to raise the £5,000 needed to fund the project each year.

The '''Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006''' (asp 11) is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]]. It received [[Royal Assent]] on 11 July 2006.

The act consolidated, repealed and replaced many other pieces of legislation, such as the [[Protection of Animals Act 1934]] and the [[Abandonment of Animals Act 1960]].

The act bans [[Docking (dog)|tail docking]] of dogs. It exempts the docking of lambs' or pigs' tails, ear tagging and the castration of farm animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6338299.stm |title=Canine tail docking ban announced |date=7 February 2007 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue has caused controversy.&lt;ref name="BBC061005"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/5411638.stm |title=Stricter animal controls in force |date=5 October 2006 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act also provided for increased slaughter powers in order to combat disease.&lt;ref name="BBC061005"/&gt;

The corresponding act for [[England and Wales]] is the [[Animal Welfare Act 2006]].

==Certification==
AMC certification is required for international medical graduates (IMGs) who wish to be licensed in Australia. To achieve AMC certification, an IMG must pass the AMC MCQ Exam and the AMC Clinical exam, as well as having the [[Doctor of Medicine|medical diploma]] verified.
*The AMC MCQ exam consists of 150 multiple choice questions (MCQs) organized through computer adaptive scoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/ass/apo/sp |title= Assessments &amp; examinations: Standard pathway| publisher= Australian Medical Council |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is delivered in one 3.5 hour session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/ass/catex |title= AMC CAT MCQ Examination | publisher= Australian Medical Council |date=28 February 2014 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pass mark is set to match the level of knowledge required by Australian medical schools for their final-year graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= March 2011 |title=MCQ Examination Specifications Booklet |url=http://www.amc.org.au/images/publications/amc_exam_spec.pdf  |publisher= Australian Medical Council |isbn=978-1-938182-07-5 |accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The AMC clinical exam consists of 16 stations. At each station the candidate has two minutes to read a presentation of a case and what tasks the candidate is expected to perform. Each station usually has three or four tasks. A task may include taking a focused [[medical history]], performing a focused [[physical examination]], suggesting [[differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]] or further [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic procedures]], or informing about treatments. A candidate then has eight minutes to perform the tasks, and is required to pass 12 out of 16 cases including one compulsory case in each of [[gynecology]] and [[pediatrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.org.au/assessment/clinical-exam/clinical-resources|title=Clinical examination specifications|publisher=Australian Medical Council|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Banana beer''' is an [[alcoholic beverage]] made from [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] of mashed [[banana]]s. [[Commercial sorghum|Sorghum]], [[millet]] or [[maize]] flour are added as a source of wild [[yeast]].&lt;ref name="xs4all"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~westher/recepten/BANANA%20BEER.htm |title=Banana Beer |publisher=Xs4all.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In [[Kenya]], banana beer is known as ''urwaga'', in [[République démocratique du Congo|RD Congo]] as Kasiksi, in [[Uganda]] as ''mubisi'', in [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]] as ''urwagwa''.&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0560E/x0560e09.htm |title=Fermented and vegetables. A global perspective. Chapter 4 |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Banana beer is sometimes consumed during rituals and ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Adekunle&gt;{{Cite book | last = Adekunle | first = Julius | title = Culture and Customs of Rwanda | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]] | date = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g0FC40EQujwC&amp;pg=PA81 | isbn =0-313-33177-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar product called ''mwenge'' is made in Uganda with only bananas and sorghum.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Indigenous Fermented Foods"&gt;Handbook of Indigenous Fermented Foods, 2nd edition 1995 {{ISBN|0-8247-9352-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be found under the names ''kasiksi'', ''nokrars'', ''rwabitoke'', ''urwedensiya'', ''urwarimu'' and ''milinda kaki''.

==Production==
[[File:Uganda local beer.jpg|thumb|Making local banana beer in Western [[Uganda]]]]
[[File:Продавец бананового пива.jpg|thumb|Selling banana beer in [[Tanzania]]]]
Banana beer is made from ripe (but not over-ripe) [[East African Highland bananas]] (''Musa acuminata'' &lt;small&gt;Colla&lt;/small&gt; (AAA-EA), ''Mbidde'' clone set).&lt;ref name="prac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://practicalaction.org/practicalanswers/product_info.php?products_id=68 |title=Banana Beer &amp;#124; Practical Answers |publisher=Practical Action |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; To accelerate the ripening of bananas, a hole is dug in the ground, lined with dried banana leaves which are then set on fire. Fresh banana leaves are laid on top of them, and then the unripe bananas. These are then covered by more fresh [[Banana leaf|banana leaves]] and pseudostems. After four to six days, the bananas are ripe enough.&lt;ref name="xs4all" /&gt; This method only works in the dry season. During the rainy season, bananas are ripened by putting them on a hurdle near a cooking fire.&lt;ref name="appro"&gt;[[Appropedia:Banana beer (Practical Action Brief)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of banana that are used for banana beer: the harsh tasting ''igikashi'' and the milder tasting ''igisahira''.&lt;ref name="zebra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zebra.lt/lt/laisvalaikis/gurmanams/Nera-mieziu-Gaminame-alu-is-bananu-2008-10-01.html |title=Laisvalaikis - ZEBRA |publisher=Zebra.lt |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The banana beer mixture consists of one third ''igikashi'' and two thirds ''igisahira''. Once ripened, the bananas are peeled. If they cannot be peeled by hand, they are not ripe enough. After peeling, the bananas are kneaded until soft. The juice is then filtered to get clear banana juice, which is then diluted with water. [[Commercial sorghum|Sorghum]] is ground and lightly roasted and then added to the juice. This mixture is left to ferment for 24 hours and then filtered.&lt;ref name="prac" /&gt;

After filtering, the beer is packaged in glass or plastic [[bottle]]s. In commercial production, the beer may first be [[pasteurization|pasteurized]] before packaging to stop fermentation and extend shelf life.&lt;ref name="prac" /&gt;

'''Byllye Yvonne Avery''' (born October 20, 1937) is an [[United States|American]] [[health care]] activist who has worked to improve the welfare of [[African-American]] women for over forty years. One of the founders of [[reproductive justice]], Avery has worked to develop healthcare services and education that address Black women's mental and physical health stressors. She is best known as the founder of the [[National Black Women's Health Project]], the first national organization to specialize in Black women's reproductive health issues. For her work with the NBWHP, she has received the [[MacArthur Foundation]]'s Fellowship for Social Contribution and the Gustav O. Lienhard Award for the Advancement of Health Care from the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[National Academy of Science]], among other awards.

== Family and education ==
Avery was born in [[Waynesville, Georgia]] and grew up on a farm in [[DeLand, Florida]]. She is the daughter of L. Alyce M. Ingram, a schoolteacher.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Price|first1=Kimala|title=Avery, Byllye|url=http://www.oxfordaasc.com/article/opr/t0001/e1263|website=Oxford African American Studies Center|publisher=Oxford|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother graduated of Bethune-Cookman College. Her father, Quitman Reddick, owned a neighborhood store. He was killed when Avery was 14 years old. The oldest of three children, Avery assumed a lot of responsibility from a young age.&lt;ref name="ross voices"&gt;Loretta Ross, [https://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/ssc/vof/transcripts/Avery.pdf, "Smith Voices of Feminism Oral History Project Interview with Byllye Avery"]. Accessed on March 25, 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Avery began studying psychology at [[Talladega College]], where she earned her BA in 1959. She met her husband, Wesley, on her first day there. They married in 1960 and had their first child the following year. They had their second child several years later. 

In 1967, Avery received a fellowship to obtain her master's in special education at the University of Florida. Upon earning her master's degree in 1969, she became a special education teacher. After a few years of teaching, she began to work at the children's mental health unit of her local hospital. Her husband suffered a fatal heart attack months after she began her new job. The death of her husband helped catalyze Avery's commitment to improving health care and health education in the Black community.&lt;ref name="ross voices"/&gt; 

Avery met her wife, Ngina Lythcott, in 1989, and the two were married in 2005. Lythcott is a public health practitioner and activist.  

== Activism ==
In the early 1970s Avery began participating in consciousness-raising groups and legal abortion referral services. In response to the lack of access to abortion and other reproductive health needs that low-income Black women faced in her community, Avery and her colleagues Joan Edelson, Judy Levy, and Margaret Parrish opened the Gainesville Women's Health Center (GWHC) and Birthplace, a midwifery service birthing center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordaasc.com/article/opr/t0001/e1263|website=Oxford African American Studies Center|publisher=Oxford|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GWHC mission statement was to "help women solve the crisis-producing situation of unplanned, unwanted pregnancy," at a low cost.&lt;ref&gt; University of Florida Digital Collections. Accessed on April 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The clinic provided abortions and contraceptive services, facilitated sexuality workshops, and provided other women's health-related training and services tailored to Black women, such as sickle cell anemia testing. To help educate women on best health services, the staff created a monthly newsletter called ''Sage-Femme''.

These various experiences led Avery to plan the first national conference on black women's health at Spelman college in 1983. Following the conference, she founded the National Black Women's Health Project, now known as the Black Women's Health Imperative, officially in 1984 in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sillman|first1=Jael|last2=Fried|first2=Marlene, Gerber|last3=Ross|first3=Loretta|last4=Gutierrez|first4=Elena R.|title=Undivided Rights: Women of Color Organize for Reproductive Justice|date=2004|publisher=South End Press|isbn=978-0-89608-729-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only national organization exclusively dedicated to improving health and wellness among Black women. 
 
Avery produced ''On Becoming a Woman: Mothers and Daughters Talking to Each Other''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~bfca/collection/special/bavery.html ''On Becoming a Woman: Mothers and Daughters Talking to Each Other'']&lt;/ref&gt; (1987), the first [[documentary film]] by African-American women sharing their perspectives on [[menstruation]], sex, and love.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/title/on-becoming-a-woman-mothers-daughters-talking-together-a-film/oclc/30694664 Accessed March 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1990, Avery, along with 15 other African-American women and men, formed the [[African-American Women for Reproductive Freedom]]. The organization was created to end the stigma against abortions in the Black community and to make abortions more accessible for Black women.&lt;ref name="Cullen-DuPont2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathryn Cullen-DuPont|title=Encyclopedia of women's history in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC|accessdate=2 March 2018|date= March 2018|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-4100-8|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery has written and lectured widely on how race, class and sex impact women's healthcare. She has been a visiting fellow at the Harvard University School of Public Health; she has served on the Charter Advisory Committee for the Office of Research on Women's Health of the National Institutes of Health; she has been a health issues advisor for the Kellogg Foundation's International Leadership Program; and she has served as a consultant on women's healthcare in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;"Neva, Goodwin.

}}{{italic title|all=yes|noerror}}'''''Chaoulli v Quebec (AG)''''' [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, {{Cite CanLII|source=scc|year=2005|num=35}},
was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] of which the Court ruled that the ''Quebec Health Insurance Act'' and the ''Hospital Insurance Act'' prohibiting private medical insurance in the face of long wait times violated the ''[[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]''. In a 4 to 3 decision, the Court found the Acts violated [[Quebec]]ers' [[right to life]] and [[security of person]] under the Quebec Charter. The ruling is binding only in Quebec. Three of the seven judges also found that the laws violated [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section seven]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. One judge did not rule on the Canadian Charter. The result was a 3–3 tie on the question of the Canadian Charter, so Chaoulli decision does not apply to any other province. 

== Background ==
Having suffered in the past from numerous health problems including a hip replacement, 73-year-old salesman George Zeliotis became an advocate for reducing waiting times for patients in Quebec hospitals.

[[Jacques Chaoulli]] is a doctor who provided home appointments to patients. He attempted to get a licence to offer his services as an independent private hospital but was rejected due to provincial legislation prohibiting private health insurance.

Together, the two men sought a [[declaratory judgment]] to contest the prohibition.

== Court's opinions ==
Three separate opinions were written. The first is by [[Marie Deschamps|Deschamps]] who found a violation of the Quebec Charter, but stated there was no necessity for her to rule on the Canadian Charter . A second opinion was written by [[Beverley McLachlin|McLachlin C.J.]] and [[John C. Major|Major J.]], with [[Michel Bastarache|Bastarache J.]] concurring, on the violation of section seven. A dissenting opinion was given by [[Ian Binnie|Binnie]] and [[Louis LeBel|LeBel]] JJ. with [[Morris Fish|Fish J.]] concurring in dissent.

=== Deschamps ===
Deschamps begins by identifying the issue as being whether the prohibition is "justified by the need to preserve the integrity of the public system" and not questioning the single-tier health system itself. In examining the legislative context of the case, she warns against politicizing the issue and against taking an emotional tone to the judgment.

The appeal court's characterization of the issue as an infringement of an economic right is rejected by Deschamps. She goes on to note that the long waits at hospitals can result in deaths and that private health care prohibited by the Quebec Acts would likely have saved those lives. The wait lists, she claims, are an implicit form of rationing, and it is the government's rationing policy that is being challenged here as a violation of the right to "security of person" (''per'' Canadian Charter) and "personal inviolability" (''per'' Quebec Charter).

Deschamps sides with the trial judge, who found a violation of section 7 of the Canadian Charter, but she interprets it as being more of a violation of the similar section 1 of the Quebec Charter. She adopts a broad interpretation, citing ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'' among others as examples of delay in medical treatment as a violation of security of person. She further rejects the dissenters' suggestion that a patient could seek medical treatment outside of the province as too extreme and case-specific.

Turning to the requisite analysis to justify the violation, Deschamps points to the "minimal impairment" expectation to be the one of the most interest. Expert and witness testimony was examined of which she found it to be not particularly credible or useful. She then examines other provinces' health legislation, finding the lack of prohibitory legislation allows her to conclude that the Quebec Acts are not necessary to preserve the public health plan. Studies on public health programs in other countries examined by Deschamps support this claim.

The issue of deference to government is considered. "When the courts are given the tools they need to make a decision, they should not hesitate to assume their responsibilities,"&lt;ref&gt;para. 87&lt;/ref&gt; she states, claiming that social policies developed by the government should not be shied away from by the courts. Deference should be given only with a justification consistent with democratic values and sufficiently necessary to maintain public order.

In concluding, Deschamp points her finger squarely at the government and suggests the need for change:
:''For many years, the government has failed to act; the situation continues to deteriorate. This is not a case in which missing scientific data would allow for a more informed decision to be made. The principle of prudence that is so popular in matters relating to the environment and to medical research cannot be transposed to this case. Under the Quebec plan, the government can control its human resources in various ways, whether by using the time of professionals who have already reached the maximum for payment by the state, by applying the provision that authorizes it to compel even nonparticipating physicians to provide services (s. 30 HEIA) or by implementing less restrictive measures, like those adopted in the four Canadian provinces that do not prohibit private insurance or in the other OECD countries. While the government has the power to decide what measures to adopt, it cannot choose to do nothing in the face of the violation of Quebecers' right to security. The government has not given reasons for its failure to act. Inertia cannot be used as an argument to justify deference.''&lt;ref&gt;para. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

=== McLachlin and Major ===
Both McLachlin and Major agree with Deschamp's reasoning but rely more on [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7]] and [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] of the Canadian Charter to reach the same outcome. They observe that the "Charter does not confer a freestanding constitutional right to health care. However, where the government puts in place a scheme to provide health care, that scheme must comply with the Charter." &lt;ref&gt;para. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine a violation of the Charter, they look at how the Quebec Acts differ from the ''[[Canada Health Act]]'''. They note that unlike with other legislation, the impugned Acts remove the ability to contract for private health care insurance and in effect create a virtual monopoly for the public health system. On the evidence of significant delays in service, this monopoly harms the right to security of person. Delays in medical treatment could have physical and stressful consequences.

In reviewing the public health care systems of several countries they find that the connection was missing. In defence of this, they criticize the dissenters' rejection of international data as well and reliance on what they characterized as inconsistent reports from [[Romanow Report|Romanow]] and Senator [[Michael J. L. Kirby|Kirby]].

=== Binnie and LeBel ===
They begin by phrasing the question as being not one of rationing, but rather
:''whether the province of Quebec not only has the constitutional authority to establish a comprehensive single-tier health plan, but to discourage a second (private) tier health sector by prohibiting the purchase and sale of private health insurance.''&lt;ref&gt;para. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

They then describe the problem as an issue of public policy and social values which is not for the courts to decide.
:''In our view, the appellants' case does not rest on constitutional law but on their disagreement with the Quebec government on aspects of its social policy. The proper forum to determine the social policy of Quebec in this matter is the National Assembly.''&lt;ref&gt;para. 167&lt;/ref&gt;
The characterization of the problem by the majority contains too much ambiguity, they claim. How can the court determine what is a "reasonable" wait time, they ask?

Binnie and LeBel primarily take issue with the majority's claim that the law is arbitrary contrary to the [[principles of fundamental justice]].
:''appellants' argument about "arbitrariness" is based largely on generalizations about the public system drawn from fragmentary experience, an overly optimistic view of the benefits offered by private health insurance, an oversimplified view of the adverse effects on the public health system of permitting private sector health services to flourish and an overly interventionist view of the role the courts should play in trying to supply a "fix" to the failings, real or perceived, of major social programs.''&lt;ref&gt;para. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

The dissenters' interpretation of the legislation finds a rational connection to the objectives of the Canadian Health Act:
:''Not all Canadian provinces prohibit private health insurance, but all of them take steps to protect the public health system by discouraging the private sector... the mixture of deterrents differs from province to province, but the underlying policies flow from the Canada Health Act and are the same: i.e. as a matter of principle, health care should be based on need, not wealth, and as a matter of practicality the provinces judge that growth of the private sector will undermine the strength of the Canada Health Act.''&lt;ref&gt;para. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

They admit agreeing with the majority and the trial judge that the law will put ''some'' Quebecers life and "security of person" at risk, but they do not see the matter being resolved by or applicable to the constitution. They state that "it will likely be a rare case where s. 7 will apply in circumstances entirely unrelated to adjudicative or administrative proceedings." However, they claim, this is not one of those times. Instead, they lament the overextension of the constitution:
:''The Court has been moving away from a  narrow approach to s. 7, which restricted the scope of the section to legal rights to be interpreted in light of the rights enumerated in [[Section Eight of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|ss. 8]]-[[Section Fourteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|14]].''&lt;ref&gt;para. 197&lt;/ref&gt;
In effect, the dissenters say, the Court is only protecting the right to contract and pushing Canada into its own [[Lochner era]], while dismissing those that claimed privatizing will not necessarily solve the problem.

They characterize the majority's use of the word "arbitrary" as meaning "unnecessary," claiming that if that were true, it would require the courts to interfere too much with lawmakers.

The dissenters' final objection is the majority's expansion of the reasoning in ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]''. Binnie and LeBel distinguish ''R. v. Morgentaler'' from the current case, as the former was about "manifest unfairness" and criminal liability, not arbitrariness and public health policy, which, they claim, requires a very different analytical approach.

== Aftermath ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
The decision proved to be highly contentious by its political nature and its conflict with the present government's policy on health. There are those,&lt;ref&gt;http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/djclimenhaga/2013/03/manning-conference-iii-rights-strategies-dominating-cities-and-w&lt;/ref&gt; who argue that this decision could potentially lead to the dismantling of the Canadian [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]] system, while others suggest that this could be a much-needed wake-up call to repair the ailing system.

This ruling could have a direct effect on most provinces that currently have laws that are designed to discourage the private sector, in particular [[Ontario]], [[Manitoba]], [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], and [[Prince Edward Island]], which all have legislation very similar to the impugned laws in Quebec.

After the Supreme Court rendered its judgment, the Attorney General of Quebec asked the Court to stay (suspend) its judgment for 18 months. The Court granted the stay for only 12 months; it therefore expired on June 8, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/news_release/2005/05-08-04.3re.wpd/05-08-04.3re.wpd.html|date=2005-08-04|accessdate=2006-08-22|title=Supreme Court of Canada News Release|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114031719/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/news_release/2005/05-08-04.3re.wpd/05-08-04.3re.wpd.html|archivedate=2009-01-14|df=}}, {{cite web|url=http://www.commentsplease.com/collection/client/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=83E5C846-A623-6E86-6FDAE5FBA332B810|date=2005-08-04|accessdate=2006-08-22|title=Comments Please}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, delegates to the [[Canadian Medical Association]] adopted a motion supporting access to private-sector health services and private medical insurance in circumstances where patients cannot obtain timely access to care through the [[single-payer health care]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sibbald B |title=CMA okays private health care for waiting patients |journal=CMAJ |volume=173 |issue=6 |pages=585 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16109752 |pmc=1197150 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.051035 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, a Quebec provincial white paper on limited private reforms was leaked to the media. The paper proposed allowing the purchase of private medical insurance. To prevent doctors from abandoning the public system, the paper would force doctors to perform a minimum amount of work in the public sector before they would be allowed to perform in the private sector.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1416">'''Collaborative Care''' is a [[healthcare]] philosophy and movement that has many names, models, and definitions that often includes the provision of mental health, behavioral health and substance use services in primary care.  Similar ideas include: [[Integrated care]], [[Primary Care Behavioral health|Primary Care Behavioral Health]], [[Integrated care system]]s, and [[shared care]].  

The [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) published an overview of many different models and the [[research]] that supports them.&lt;ref&gt;Butler M, Kane RL, McAlpine D, Kathol, RG, Fu SS, Hagedorn H, Wilt TJ. Integration of Mental Health/Substance Abuse and Primary Care No. 173 (Prepared by the Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center under Contract No. 290-02-0009.) AHRQ Publication No. 09-E003. Rockville, MD. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key features of Collaborative Care models are:&lt;br /&gt;
*Integration of [[mental health professional]]s in [[primary care]] medical settings&lt;br /&gt;
*Close collaboration between [[mental health]] and medical/[[nursing]] providers&lt;br /&gt;
*Focus on treating the whole person and whole family.

There are organisations in many countries promoting these ideas such as the American [[Collaborative Family Healthcare Association]].

'''Savita Halappanavar''' was a 31-year-old Indian dentist who died on 28 October 2012 at [[University Hospital Galway]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] due to the complications of a [[septic miscarriage]] at 17 weeks' gestation.  The miscarriage took seven days to unfold, and early in the process, when it was clear that the miscarriage was inevitable, Halappanavar requested an abortion. At that time the medical team had not diagnosed her with a blood infection, and her request was denied because the medical team did not judge that her life was in danger. The medical team eventually did diagnose the sepsis and began trying to treat it, and when they determined that Halappanavar's life was in danger they had planned to administer [[misoprostol]] to induce delivery, but the miscarriage completed before they were able to. The sepsis continued developing and she died of [[cardiac arrest]] caused by the sepsis.&lt;ref name=HSEreport/&gt;{{rp|22–53}} Her death caused controversy at the time, nationally and internationally, leading to protests and marches.

After her death, a Coroner's Inquest was held, finding that she died of [[medical misadventure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/savita-inquest-the-coroners-9-recommendations-876864-Apr2013/|newspaper=The Journal.ie|title=Savita inquest: The coroner's nine recommendations endorsed by the jury|date=19 April 2013|first=Sinead|last=O'Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Health Service Executive|HSE]] and [[HIQA]] conducted an investigation. Both criticized the team for not diagnosing the sepsis soon enough and for not using already-standard screening tools for detecting and managing maternal sepsis, and for poor keeping of medical records, poor communication at shift changes, and failure to notify staff with needed expertise, and criticized the administration of the hospital for the poor system in which the team failed. They made recommendations about training and policies for the hospital locally along with a number of national recommendations, including the creation of a laboratory system to coordinate a national response to emerging [[Antimicrobial resistance|microbial threats]].&lt;ref name=hiqa2103&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigation into the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the Health Service Executive to patients, including pregnant women, at risk of clinical deterioration, including those provided in University Hospital Galway, and as reflected in the care and treatment provided to Savita Halappanavar|url=https://www.hiqa.ie/sites/default/files/2017-01/Patient-Safety-Investigation-UHG.pdf|publisher=Health Information and Quality Authority|date=7 October 2013}} {{cite press release|url=https://www.hiqa.ie/hiqa-news-updates/patient-safety-investigation-report-published-health-information-and-quality|publisher=HIQA|date=9 October 2013|title=Press release: Patient Safety Investigation Report published by Health Information and Quality Authority (Savita Halappanavar)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HSE also recommended changes to the legal situation and training of doctors about the law.&lt;ref name=HSEreport/&gt;

The law in force at the time (the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]), stated that the act of abortion, where there was no immediate physiological threat to the woman's life to continue the pregnancy, was a [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland#Law|criminal offence]] punishable by [[life imprisonment]]. Following a ruling of the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]] in 1992&amp;mdash;now known in Ireland as the [[Attorney General v. X|X case]]&amp;mdash;terminations are allowed under certain circumstances, where "a pregnant woman's life is at risk because of pregnancy, including the risk of suicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/most-tds-will-back-legislation-on-x-case-3296831.html|title= Most TDs will back legislation on X Case|work=Irish Independent|date=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However at the time of Halappanavar's death, there was legal uncertainty regarding the precise circumstances in which this exception to preserve the life of the mother would apply in practice, as the matter had not yet been enacted in legislation. The [[Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013]] was passed as a result of her death.

==Death==

Savita Halappanavar, 17 weeks pregnant with her first baby, went to the hospital with her husband Praveen on 21 October 2012 complaining about back pain. She was examined and discharged, and then returned to the hospital a few hours later after she felt something "coming down."  An examination showed that the gestational sac had protruded into her vagina, almost to the opening. She was admitted to the hospital for observation, as a miscarriage appeared to be inevitable.&lt;ref name=HSEreport&gt;{{cite web|last=External Independent Committee|title=Investigation of Incident 50278 from time of patient’s self referral to hospital on the 21st of October 2012 to the patient’s death on the 28th of October, 2012.|url=https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/news/nimtreport50278.pdf|publisher=[[Health Service Executive|HSE]]|date=June 2013}} {{cite press release|title=HSE publishes Report of the Investigation into the death of Ms. Savita Halappanavar|publisher=[[Health Service Executive|HSE]]|url=https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/news/media/pressrel/newsarchive/2013archive/jun13/savitareport.html|language=en|date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22–26}}  Her [[Premature rupture of membranes|water broke]] just after midnight on 22 October.&lt;ref name=HSEreport/&gt;{{rp|29}} On the 23 the Halappanavars discussed terminating the pregnancy early with one of the consultant doctors: according to the 2013 Health Service report: "O&amp;G Consultant 1 stated that the patient and her husband were advised of Irish law in relation to this. At interview the consultant stated 'Under Irish law, if there’s no evidence of risk to the life of the mother, our hands are tied so long as there’s a fetal heart'. The consultant stated that if risk to the mother was to increase a termination would have been possible, but that it would be based on actual risk and not a theoretical risk of infection 'we can’t predict who is going to get an infection'".&lt;ref name=HSEreport/&gt;{{rp|33}}  Midwife manager Ann Maria Burke attempted to calm the couple and explained that the termination cannot be carried out because Ireland is "a Catholic country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[RTÉ News and Current Affairs|RTÉ News]]|title=

==Reaction==
On 3 November 2012, friends and family of the Halappanavars contacted local pro-choice groups (Galway Pro-Choice) to find out what they could do, with dozens of her friends and family meeting in person on the 6th. Galway Pro-Choice put them in contact with ''[[The Irish Times]]'' journalist Kitty Holland,&lt;ref name="irishexaminer.com"&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/columnists/victoria-white/savitas-death-is-not-about-abortion-it-is-about-medical-negligence-247993.html|first=Victoria|last=White|title=Savita’s death is not about abortion, it is about medical negligence Thursday|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/global-observers-horrified-and-bewildered-by-savita-case-1.2568298|title=Global observers horrified and bewildered by Savita case|first=Kitty|last=Holland|date=11 March 2016|quote=Neither he, nor the close-knit Indian community in Galway, who first approached The Irish Times about what had happened to Savita}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 7 November.&lt;ref name="Galway Pro-Choice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galwayprochoice.org/2012/12/galway-pro-choice-were-approached-by-savitas-friends/|publisher=Galway Pro-Choice|title=Galway Pro Choice Were Approached by Savita’s Friends|date=2012-11-21|accessdate=2015-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211201358/http://galwayprochoice.org/2012/12/galway-pro-choice-were-approached-by-savitas-friends/|archive-date=11 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holland 70"&gt;{{cite book |last=Holland|first=Kitty|title=Savita: The Tragedy that Shook a Nation|publisher=Transworld Ireland|page=70|isbn=978-1848271838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-choice groups then organised on the Irish Choice Network (ICN) email group before the story broke.&lt;ref name="Irish Independent"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/prochoice-activists-got-tipoff-on-tragic-death-28902755.html |title=Pro-choice activists got tip-off on tragic death | work=Irish Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halappanavar's death became public after the ''[[Tonight with Vincent Browne]]'' programme showed front-page stories by ''The Irish Times'' and the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' newspapers on 13 November 2012.&lt;ref name="it-savita-story-resonates-around-world"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1117/1224326702387.html|title=Savita story resonates around the world|date=17 November 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012|last=Mullally|first=Una|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the news being disseminated on [[Twitter]], including tweets by journalists [[Caitlin Moran]] and [[India Knight]], and coverage by publications such as [[BBC News]], the British edition of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', and ''[[The Independent]]'' newspapers.&lt;ref name="it-savita-story-resonates-around-world" /&gt;

On 14 November 2012, more than 2,000 people gathered in her memory and to protest Ireland's abortion laws outside the [[Dáil]] in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/savita-demonstration-leinster-house-674695-Nov2012/|title=‘Over 2,000′ attend sit-down protest for Halappanavar at Leinster House|publisher=[[TheJournal.ie]]|work=The Journal| date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a candle-light vigil was held in Cork.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741|title=Woman dies after abortion request 'refused' at Galway hospital|work=BBC News|date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government's expert committee in abortion, to address the ''[[A, B and C v Ireland]]'' judgement, handed in its report to the Department of Health the evening before the new story broke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/taoiseach-expert-group-delivered-abortion-report-last-night-574183.html|title=Taoiseach: Expert group delivered abortion report last night|date=14 November 2012|accessdate=9 June 2016|publisher=Breaking News.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halappanavar's death led to protests in [[Galway]], particularly from the local Indian expatriate community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/16/ireland-abortion-savita-halappanavar-indian-envoy|title=Savita Halappanavar 'would still be alive if she had been treated in India'|work=The Guardian|date=16 November 2012|location=London|first=Henry|last=McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 November ''The Daily Mirror'' reported that the University Hospital was the subject of several investigations.&lt;ref name="mir12"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/savita-halappanavar-husband-claims-pregnant-1435830|title=Savita Halappanavar: Husband claims pregnant wife would still be alive if doctors hadn't 'refused' her an abortion, however the actual Medical Report states that this was not the case.|date=14 November 2012|last=Rudd|first=Andy|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror|''The Mirror'']]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halappanavar had been one of the organisers of the annual Galway [[Diwali]] festival, which was cancelled in response to her death.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57549651/husband-ireland-hospital-denied-savita-halappanavar-life-saving-abortion-because-it-is-a-catholic-country/|title=Husband: Ireland hospital denied Savita Halappanavar life saving abortion because it is a "Catholic country"|publisher=[[CBS News]]|work=CBS News|date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were calls upon the [[Taoiseach]] to secure an external enquiry into the circumstances surrounding Halappanavar's death.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; There were also calls for a change in the law, as the legislation at the time was an Act of the British Parliament of 1861&amp;mdash;when Ireland was still part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] &amp;mdash;which declared that it was unlawful to "procure a miscarriage".&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; On 16 November, the Irish [[Health Service Executive]] established an independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Halappanavar's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1116/breaking2.html|title=HSE still finalising details of Savita Halappanavar inquiry|work=The Irish Times| date=16 November 2012| accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday 17 November, the [[Garda Síochána]] (Ireland's national police) estimated that between ten and twelve thousand protesters marched from [[Parnell Square]] to [[Merrion Square]] to demand a change in the law, whilst other rallies were also held across Ireland and in many other countries abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1117/breaking4.html|title=Thousands attend Savita vigils around the country|work=The Irish Times|date=17 November 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the Gardaí announced that they were assisting the coroner in the investigation into the death of Halappanavar.&lt;ref name="it-gardai-assisting-coroner"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1117/breaking4.html|title=Gardaí assisting coroner in Savita Halappanavar case|date=17 November 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical terminations had previously been performed at the University Hospital when complications arose in pregnancy, as it is permitted by Irish law to save the life of the woman. In an opinion piece in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', Paul Bracchi speculated that an investigation would be carried out into why this did not occur in Halappanavar's case.

On Monday, 19 November, the Roman Catholic Bishops of Ireland met in response to Halappanavar's death and released a statement that the Catholic Church believes in the "equal and inalienable right to life of a mother and her unborn child" and that the Church has never taught that the life of an unborn child takes precedence over the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/1119/x-case-legislation-abortion.html|title=Treatment that risks foetus can be 'ethically permissible' - Catholic bishops|work=RTÉ News | date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eilis O'Hanlon stated that in its initial coverage, ''The Irish Times'' had "opted to present what had happened as a simple morality tale" and that "the debate for the rest of the week was coloured entirely by The Irish Times's decision to reduce a complex personal tragedy, about which few facts were still known, to a rallying call."&lt;ref name="metaanalysis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/eilis-ohanlon-this-government-must-be-the-one-to-face-facts-3296910.html|title=Eilis O'Hanlon: This Government must be the one to face facts|last=Eilis O'Hanlon:|date=18 November 2012|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis in ''The Irish Times'' on 17 November stated: "There is much we do not know about the medical care Savita Halappanavar received" and "even before the full facts are established Ms Halappanavar’s tragedy has generated much national and international coverage" in both traditional and social media of which much has been "careful and sympathetic" but "much&amp;nbsp;... has been intemperate, intolerant and politicised."&lt;ref name="change in debate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/1117/1224326702600.html|title=Decisive change in the abortion debate|last=Noel Whelan|date=17 November 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from the medical community===
The staff of University Hospital, as well as members of Ireland's Health Services Executive (HSE) Regional Health Forum stated that there is no "Catholic ethos" that is impacting treatment provided.&lt;ref name="humphreys"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1116/1224326668071.html|title=Catholic ethos suggestion dismissed|last=Humphreys|first=Joe|date=16 November 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Sam Coulter-Smith, a consultant in [[obstetrics]] and [[gynaecology]] and a [[Trinity College Dublin|university master]] in the [[Rotunda Hospital]], one of the largest maternity hospitals in Ireland, said that it would be preferable to introduce legislation to bring in clarity, saying, "We really do need legislation in this area, otherwise we're going to be at risk of doctors working outside the law, and that's not appropriate."&lt;ref name="We absolutely need legislation - Rotunda Master Dr Sam Coulter-Smith"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/av/2012/1116/media-3436430.html|title=We absolutely need legislation - Rotunda Master Dr Sam Coulter-Smith|work=RTÉ|date=15 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128092407/http://www.rte.ie/news/av/2012/1116/media-3436430.html|archivedate=28 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rotunda head: No confusion"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/rotunda-head-no-confusion-574300.html|title= Rotunda head: No confusion|work=Irish Examiner|date=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Rhona Mahony, Master of the National Maternity Hospital, said: "It is very disappointing that, 20 years after the 'X-Case', we don't have legislation" and that women "need to know that they are going to get the appropriate health care that they need" while doctors "need to know that they are also protected in their ability to do their job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/maternity-hospital-chief-women-and-doctors-need-protection-574284.html|title=Maternity hospital chief: Women and doctors need protection|date=15 November 2012|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Boylan, of the Irish Institute of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: "The current situation is like a [[sword of Damocles]] hanging over us.

===Political response in 2012===
A week after the story broke, while the investigations were still ongoing, [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] stated: "I don't think we should say anything about this until we are in possession of all the facts."&lt;ref name="itvnov17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2012-11-14/enda-kenny-wants-all-the-facts-before-savita-action/|title=Enda Kenny wants 'all the facts' before Savita action -|date=17 November 2012|work=ITV News|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to publication of the reports, the Minister for Health, [[James Reilly (Irish politician)|James Reilly]], said that the public must not pre-judge the situation and further said that he was awaiting the results of the investigations, adding he had no evidence to suggest a so-called "Catholic ethos" at the University Hospital that prevented Halappanavar's life from being saved by a medical termination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/reilly-no-evidence-catholic-ethos-prevented-savitas-life-from-being-saved-574238.html |title=Reilly: No evidence Catholic ethos prevented Savita's life from being saved |publisher=Irish Examiner |date=14 November 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also stated that an inquiry into Halappanavar's death must stand up to international scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/video-probe-must-stand-up-to-international-scrutiny-reilly-3294919.html|title=Video: Probe must stand up to international scrutiny - Reilly|work=Independent.ie|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Walsh (Irish politician)|Brian Walsh]], a [[Fine Gael]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]] for [[Galway West (Dáil constituency)|Galway West]], said that Galway University Hospital had carried out terminations in recent years in accordance with the judgement by the Supreme Court in the X case and with the guidelines of the Irish Medical Council. He said that the University Hospital was not run or managed by any [Catholic] religious orders and did not have a so-called "Catholic ethos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2012/1116/1224326668914.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127061746/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2012/1116/1224326668914.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 January 2013 |title=Too soon to commit on abortion legislation, says Reilly |publisher=The Irish Times |date=16 November 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fianna Fáil]] leader [[Micheál Martin]] said that Halappanavar's death was tragic and harrowing. Martin said that Ireland had always aimed for a low death rate during pregnancy but that this was "cold comfort" to Halappanavar and her surviving family and relatives. He said that an independent inquiry was needed, with experts from outside the country to establish the full circumstances. He also responded on 17 November, saying that "legislating for the X case would not have stopped [the death of Savita Halappanavar]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/law-on-x-case-would-not-have-saved-savita-says-martin-3294869.html|title=Law on X Case would not have saved Savita, says Martin|work=Herald.ie|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012|last=Murphy|first=Cormac}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 December 2012, after a panel of experts submitted its report to the Parliament recommending, "the government legislate the issue in order to clarify what the current laws actually do and do not permit", Ireland's then [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister of Health]], [[James Reilly (Irish politician)|James Reilly]], stated "We will clarify in legislation and regulation what is available by way of treatment to a woman when a pregnancy gives rise to a threat to a woman’s life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ireland’s Historic Abortion Shift and the Tragedy That Shadowed It|url=http://world.time.com/2012/12/19/irelands-historic-abortion-shift-and-the-tragedy-that-shadowed-it/ |date=19 December 2012 |publisher=TIME |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response of pro-choice organisations in 2012===
[[Pro-choice]] campaigners highlighted at the time that the lack of legislation clarifying the limited circumstances in which abortion is legal in Ireland contributed to Halappanavar's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/termination-would-have-saved-savita-heartbroken-husband-3294638.html?start=3 |title='Termination would have saved Savita' - heartbroken husband |publisher=The Independent |date=15 November 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several rallies and vigils were organised nationwide, calling for the Irish government to legislate in relation to abortion on the basis of the ''[[X Case|Attorney General v. X]]''. Campaigners argued that legislation remained outstanding at the time of Halappanavar's death despite the [[European Court of Human Rights]] having instructed the state to clarify its laws on abortion after finding in ''[[A, B and C v Ireland]]'' (2010) that the Republic of Ireland had violated the Convention by failing to provide an accessible and effective procedure by which a woman can have established whether she qualifies for a legal abortion under current Irish law.

Irish Choice Network allegedly emailed members, calling for an emergency meeting to discuss how to proceed with this "major news story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Reilly, Jerome |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/prochoice-activists-got-tipoff-on-tragic-death-3296844.html |title=Pro-choice activists got tip-off on tragic death |publisher=The Independent |date=18 November 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to critics accusing pro-choice activists of exploiting Halappanavar's death, [[Kate Smurthwaite]] responded in a column in ''The Huffington Post'' titled "Yes, Savita Halappanavar's Death IS a Political Issue" in which she stated, "If I am ever a victim of an unjust legal discrepancy that infringes my human rights and leads to my untimely and unnecessary agonising death I want every man, woman and child on the streets immediately demanding that it never, ever be allowed to happen again."&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/kate-smurthwaite/savita-halappanavar-abortion_b_2135674.html|title=Yes, Savita Halappanavar's Death IS a Political Issue|last=Kate Smurthwaite:|date=15 November 2012|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response of pro-life organisations in 2012===
{{Abortion in the Catholic Church}}
The Life Institute in Ireland has accused what it called "abortion campaigners" of exploiting Halappanavar's death to further the pro-choice agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1115/1224326607685.html|title=Lobby group accused of exploiting death|work=The Irish Times|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012|first=Ciara|last=Kenny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Kelly of ''The Catholic World Report'' rejects claims that Ireland's abortion laws led to Halappanavar's death, writing that "medical experts and bioethicists have been quick to express their view that Ireland's ban on abortion had nothing to do with Mrs. Halappanavar’s death. They insist that guidelines from the Irish Medical Council are perfectly clear that pregnant women must be given all necessary medical treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/1751/after_tragedy_irish_abortion_laws_come_under_fire.aspx|title=After Tragedy, Irish Abortion Laws Come Under Fire|date=15 November 2012|work=The Catholic World Report|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Father Shenan J. Boquet, president of [[Human Life International]], said that there was no evidence to indicate that "a Catholic ethos" prevented responsible treatment of the mother, and called news reports that that was the case "demonizing the church's position on abortion".

In an editorial on 17 November 2012, ''[[The Times of India]]'' said, "There appears to be a tendency to view this issue in terms of India versus Ireland or the Catholic faith against other religions.

==HSE inquiry 2012==
On 19 November 2012, the HSE named Professor Sir [[Sabaratnam Arulkumaran]] to head a seven-member panel looking into the case. Arulkumaran is the head of obstetrics and gynaecology at [[St George's Hospital Medical School]] and is president-elect of the [[International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics]].  The panel sought to uncover all the facts and "to identify any safety issues arising in this case".&lt;ref name="ITnov19"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1119/breaking1.html|title=HSE unveils membership of Halappanavar inquiry team|date=19 November 2012|work=[[The Irish Times]]|pages=direct quote is from the video, at approx 1 min|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2012, three members of the panel were asked to step down when Savita Halappanavar's husband, Praveen Halappanavar, indicated that he would not cooperate with the panel due to their connections as consultants to University Hospital.

=== Arulkumaran report ===

The Arulkumaran report was published on 13 June 2013. It identified three "Key Causal Factors" for the death: inadequate assessment and monitoring; failure to offer all management options to a patient; and non adherence to clinical guidelines related to the prompt and effective management of sepsis. It made six recommendations for improvements in patient care in such situations.  Most recommendations called for improvements in healthcare guideline, training and practices, and one recommendation called for legislative changes if necessary to allow for expediting delivery for clinical purposes.  Additionally, it made three recommendations to address incidental factors.&lt;ref name=HSEreport/&gt;{{rp|13–18}}

=== Key causal factors===

The report indicates the first key causal factor was inadequate assessment and monitoring.  This would have allowed medical staff to recognise and respond to indicators that the infection was causing a deterioration in Savita's condition.  Additionally, staff failed to devise a plan of care recognising that (1) the infection was the most likely cause of the patient's miscarriage, and, (2.) With increase in time following admission, and the rupture of the patient's membranes, the risk of infection and [[sepsis]] increases.

The panel identified the hospital's failure to offer all management options to a patient was a second key causal factor.  The panel points out that the patient was "experiencing inevitable miscarriage of an early second trimester pregnancy where the risk to the mother increased with time from the time that membranes were ruptured."&lt;ref name=HSEreport/&gt;{{rp|13}}

The panel found that hospital staff failed to adhere to clinical guidelines which relate to severe sepsis and septic shock.  These relate to timely and effective management of sepsis when it is diagnosed.&lt;ref name=HSEreport/&gt;{{rp|13}}

In reviewing the care given to Halappanavar in light of clinical guidelines, the panel wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Rupture of membranes may be caused by infection and vomiting indicates that the patient was unwell increasing the possibility of infection becoming systemic to causing sepsis. At
interview, clinicians indicated that their management decisions were guided by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Green-top guidelines for the Management of Preterm Pre-labour Rupture of the Membranes (RCOG Green-top Guideline No.44 2006 amended 2010). The patient was commenced on erythromycin at 22.00hrs on the 22nd of October. Erythromycin is indicated for use prophylactically in preterm pre-labour rupture of the membranes in the absence of signs such as a faster pulse or lower blood pressure or raised temperature (Green-top Guidelines No 44 (2006 with amendment Oct 2010)). Erythromycin has also been shown to delay delivery which is beneficial in the management of preterm pre-labour rupture of the membranes but not in cases of inevitable miscarriage.However, in cases of preterm pre-labour rupture of the membranes where signs of sepsis occur, best practice guidelines promote that delivery is expedited.&lt;p&gt;
The appropriate management of spontaneous rupture of the membranes in cases of inevitable miscarriage where infection is a possible underlying cause is somewhat different to  the appropriate management of Preterm Pre-labour Rupture of the Membranes where the incidence of infection at presentation is lower and the survival of the fetus is more likely.&lt;p&gt;There are no accepted clear local, national or international guidelines on the management of inevitable early second trimester miscarriage (i.e. less than 24 weeks) including the management of miscarriage where there is prolonged rupture of the membranes. The reason for the absence of such guidelines may be that clinical practice in other jurisdictions would have led to an early termination of pregnancy in equivalent clinical circumstances. It is recommended that such guidelines be developed for such patients as a matter of urgency and they should be explicit in the guidance given as to when one should offer termination based on symptoms and signs of infection implying increasing health risk to the mother which may even threaten her life.&lt;p&gt;We recognise that such guidelines must be consistent with applicable law and that the guidance so urged may require legal change.&lt;ref name=HSEreport/&gt;{{rp|58–59}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Recommendations of the Panel===

# Prompt introduction of a Maternity Early Warning Scoring Systems Chart for patients with pregnancy complications in gynaecology wards.  This should be followed by a compliance audit.  The chart should indicate a monitoring coupled with an escalating nursing, medical and multidisciplinary response.&lt;ref name=HSEreport/&gt;{{rp|15}} 
# Introduction of mandatory induction and education on early recognition, monitoring and management of infection and sepsis.  This includes severe sepsis and septic shock.
# Development and implementation of national guidelines relating to infection and pregnancy, in addition to multidisciplinary educational programmes to improve care in such cases.  In particular, there needs to be audited compliance with guidelines on management of infection, sepsis, and suspected sepsis in cases of inevitable miscarriage of an early second trimester pregnancy.  This includes when there is a prolonged rupture of membranes, and increasing time from this point increases the risk to the mother.  
# Two sub-recommendations:
## Compliance with guidelines on the management of early second trimester inevitable miscarriage.  This should recognise possible rapid patient deterioration, possibly within a few hours, from sepsis to severe sepsis to septic shock.  It should also recognise the high mortality rate, of up to 60 percent, associated with this.  These guidelines should include the same emphases as those for infection and pregnancy listed in recommendation 3.&lt;ref name=HSEreport/&gt;{{rp|16}}  The panel recommended such guidelines should include guidelines relating to expediting delivery for clinical reasons, including "medical and surgical termination" based on the expertise available and legal feasibility.&lt;ref name=HSEreport/&gt;{{rp|17}} 
## Clear statement of the legal context in which clinical professional judgement can be exercised in the best medical welfare interests of patients. The Oireachtas should consider the law including any necessary constitutional change and related administrative, legal and clinical guidelines in relation to the management of inevitable miscarriage in the early second trimester of a pregnancy.

In 2017, Arulkumaran commented that a significant contributing factor to her death was Ireland's restrictive abortion laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Author of Savita Halappanavar report says 8th Amendment contributed to her death|url=https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/author-of-savita-halappanavar-report-says-8th-amendment-contributed-to-her-death-810432.html|newspaper=BreakingNews.ie|date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having passed [[bicameralism|both Houses]] of the [[Oireachtas]] in July 2013, it was [[signed into law]] on 30 July by [[Michael D.

On 20 September 2013, Praveen Halappanavar's solicitor served legal proceedings against Galway University Hospital and separately against Doctor Katherine Astbury. The proceedings claim that Halappanavar's constitutional right to life had been breached and allege 30 issues of medical negligence.&lt;ref name="Ind-Crawford"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crawford|first=Caroline|title=Savita's husband to sue her doctor for negligence|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/savitas-husband-to-sue-her-doctor-for-negligence-29596560.html|accessdate=26 September 2013|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times-Holland"&gt;{{cite news|last=Holland|first=Kitty|title=Halappanavar begins action against hospital, doctor|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/halappanavar-begins-action-against-hospital-doctor-1.1536230|accessdate=26 September 2013|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of abortion law in Ireland continued to be an issue for political debate. In 2016-17 the Irish government convened a [[Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)|Citizens' Assembly]] to advise about the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment]].

On 20 May 2018, the parents of Halappanavar called for a Yes vote in Ireland's [[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018 (Ireland)|referendum on the repeal of the Eighth Amendment]] with her father saying, "I hope the people of Ireland will vote yes for abortion, for the ladies of Ireland and the people of Ireland. My daughter, she lost her life because of this abortion law, because of the diagnosis, and she could not have an abortion. She died."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/savita-s-father-calls-for-repeal-as-campaigns-target-undecided-1.3501906|title=Savita’s father calls for repeal as campaigns target undecided|last=Holland|first=Kitty|work=The Irish Times|date=20 May 2018|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 of May 2018, the people of Ireland voted Yes to repeal the Eighth Amendment by a margin of 2 to 1.

On September 30, 2018, an open letter by [[Emma Watson]] to Halappanavar was published in ''Porter'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/emma-watson-savita-halappanavar-abortion-ireland-death-miscarriage-letter-porter-magazine-a8563131.html|title=EMMA WATSON PENS POWERFUL LETTER TO SAVITA HALAPPANAVAR, WHO DIED AFTER BEING DENIED AN ABORTION IN IRELAND|last=Barr|first=Sabrina|date=30 September 2018|access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications of decreased '''emotional well-being''' are related to [[mental health]] concerns such as [[Stress (biology)|stress]], [[Mood disorder|depression]], and [[anxiety]]. These in turn can contribute to physical ill-health such as [[Gastroenterology|digestive disorders]], [[Sleep disorder|sleep disturbances]], and general [[Fatigue (medical)|lack of energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emotional Well Being &amp; Mental Health|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/category/emotional-well-being-and-mental-health|work=Harvard Health Publications: Harvard medical School|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The profile of a person prone to emotional distress is usually someone with low self-esteem, pessimistic, emotionally sensitive, very self-critical…, people who need to constantly assert themselves through their behavior. They also tend to be afraid, overly worried about the future, and focused on the past. As Dr. Marisa Navarro says in her book [http://lamedicinaemocional.com/ La Medicina Emocional] (Emotional Medicine), "no one is safe from suffering this emotional state. It is a very serious problem that can result in constant states of anger, sadness, worry and even anxiety or depression&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mylibreto.com/libros/es_la-medicina-emocional-marisa-navarro-superacion-equilibrio.html|title=La Medicina Emocional (Emotional Medicine)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;".

On the positive side, enhanced emotional well-being is seen to contribute to upward spirals in increasing [[Coping (psychology)|coping ability]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fredrickson|first=Barbara L|author2=Thomas Joiner|title=Positive Emotions Trigger Upward Spirals Toward Emotional Well-Being|journal=Psychological Science|date=March 2002|volume=13|issue=2|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00431|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/13/2/172.abstract|accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[self-esteem]], [[Performance management|performance]] and [[productivity]] at work, and even longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tis more blessed to give than to receive? Groundbreaking new outcomes research altruistic emotions and helping behavior|url=http://www.care-givers.com/DBArticles/pages/viewarticle.php?id=751|publisher=EMPOWERING CAREGIVERS|accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thoughts determine our feelings, and thoughts are nothing more than firings of neurons. And those feelings that our thoughts generate make our body release extremely addicting substances like adrenaline and cortisol. Like with any other addiction, the need to continually feed off these addicting substances tends to make the body think and feel in a certain way. When someone decides to disengage from these emotional addictions, they have to learn to think differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news3edad.com/2017/03/06/que-son-y-como-se-superan-las-adicciones-emocionales/|title=News 3 Edad|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection between the mind and the body is so strong that mental and physical states feed into each other in both a positive and negative way. Feelings depend on thoughts and both determine attitudes and actions. This is the first thing that children would have to learn at a young age in order to learn that they can take the reins of their lives. And their feelings would not depend on what is happening around them, but rather their interpretation about what is happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.serpadres.es/3-6-anos/educacion-desarrollo/articulo/educar-las-emociones-previene-el-acoso-escolar-181461570448|title=Ser Padres (Bullying)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional well-being is also one of two aspects of personal [[well-being]] that can be measured in quantitative [[quality of life]] assessments, the other being 'life evaluation', the evaluation of one's life in general against a scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|author2=Angus Deaton|title=High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being|journal=PNAS|date=September 2010|volume=107|issue=38|doi=10.1073/pnas.1011492107|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489|accessdate=16 December 2010|pmid=20823223|pmc=2944762}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a term receiving attention from many groups, from [[New Age|new-age]] therapists to [[management consultant]]s, from [[outdoor recreation]] enthusiasts to [[Elderly care|carers for the elderly]]. It is also of interest to many [[Parenting|parents]], [[youth worker]]s, [[school teacher]]s, anti-[[bullying]] campaigners and those thinking about [[retirement]], as well as to [[psychologist]]s and other [[health professional]]s.

Good emotional health leads to better physical health, prevents diseases, and makes it possible to enjoy life and be happier. In this way one can become a "medicine person" through mirror neurons, those that lead to empathy and fire to imitate the emotions of others. Mirror neurons are what make people feel good when they are with someone who is positive, cheerful and motivational. At the other extreme are the so-called "toxic people", who make others around them feel bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infosalus.com/salud-investigacion/noticia-tipo-persona-eres-toxica-medicinal-20160507080632.html|title=Infosalus (Toxic Person)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Surgeon General of the United States]] has made emotional well-being one of his priorities &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Surgeon General's Priorities|url=https://www.surgeongeneral.gov/priorities/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke about its importance at the Aspen Ideas Festival 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surgeon General Vivek Murthy on the importance of emotional well-being|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQOppXJLzMo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicians must take a holistic approach to patients by caring for physical, psychological, and social health. To that end, they need to become aware of the importance of emotional medicine in order to help their patients decrease and manage negative feelings that can damage their health and teach them to enhance the positive feelings that can prevent and help heal illness.

'''Eugene Ellsworth Landy''' (November 26, 1934&amp;nbsp;– March 22, 2006) was an American psychologist and psychotherapist best known for his unconventional 24-hour therapy, and especially for his treatment of [[the Beach Boys]] co-founder [[Brian Wilson]] in the 1970s and 1980s, which was deemed unethical by Californian courts. His treatment of Wilson was dramatized in the 2014 [[biographical film]] ''[[Love &amp; Mercy (film)|Love &amp; Mercy]]'', in which Landy is portrayed by [[Paul Giamatti]].

As a teenager, Landy aspired to show business, briefly serving as an early manager for [[George Benson]]. During the 1960s, he began studying psychology, earning his doctorate at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. After moving to Los Angeles, he treated many celebrity clients, including musician [[Alice Cooper]] and actors [[Richard Harris]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Maureen McCormick]], and [[Gig Young]]. He also developed an unorthodox 24-hour therapy intended to stabilize his patients by micromanaging their lives with a team of counselors and doctors.

Brian Wilson initially became a patient under Landy's program in 1975. Landy was soon discharged due to his burdensome fees. In 1983, Landy was re-employed as Wilson's therapist, subsequently becoming his executive producer, business manager, co-songwriter, and business adviser. Landy went on to co-produce Wilson's debut solo album ''[[Brian Wilson (album)|Brian Wilson]]'' (1988) and its unreleased follow-up ''[[Sweet Insanity]]'' (1991), as well as allegedly [[ghostwriter|ghostwrote]] portions of Wilson's disowned memoir ''[[Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story]]'' (1991).

In 1989, Landy agreed to let the state of California revoke his professional license amidst accusations of ethical violations and patient misconduct. Wilson continued to see Landy until a 1992 restraining order barred Landy from contacting the musician ever again. After the 1990s, Landy continued a psychotherapy practice with licensure in New Mexico and Hawaii until his death.

==Early life and education==

Eugene Ellsworth Landy was born on November 26, 1934, in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], the only child of Jules C. Landy, a medical doctor and psychology professor,&lt;ref name=Independent2006 /&gt; and Frieda Mae Gordon Landy, also a psychology professor.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998/&gt; Eugene dropped out of school in the sixth grade, later claiming to be [[dyslexic]].&lt;ref name=Independent2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiller1998/&gt; At age 16, he pursued a career in show business, producing a nationally syndicated radio show, and discovering 10-year-old [[George Benson]].&lt;ref name=Independent2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit /&gt; Landy briefly served as Benson's manager&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit /&gt; and worked odd jobs as a radio producer, promoting records and producing a single for [[Frankie Avalon]].&lt;ref name=Spiller1998/&gt;

Honoring his parents' wishes, Landy resumed his psychiatric studies at [[Los Angeles City College]], where he earned an [[Associate of Arts|AA]] in [[chemistry]], and entered medical school at the National University of Mexico. After falling ill with [[dysentery]], he switched to psychology.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998/&gt; He earned a master's degree in psychology from the [[University of Oklahoma]] in 1967, completing his training with a PhD in 1968.&lt;ref name=Independent2006 /&gt;

After completing his studies, Landy worked for the [[Peace Corps]], eventually moving to Los Angeles&lt;ref name="Felton"/&gt; to work as a drug counselor at Harbor Hospital and as a popular part-time instructor at [[California State University, Northridge|San Fernando Valley State College]]. Landy began developing ideas for his 24-hour treatment program while engaging in postdoctoral work at [[Rancho Santa Fe]].&lt;ref name=Spiller1998/&gt; It was there that he practiced "marathon therapy", in which a therapist takes control of a group of people for a day or more.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998/&gt; In 1968, he worked briefly as an intern at Gateways Hospital in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles]], where he developed his methods further, experimenting with treatment on teenage drug abusers with varying degrees of success. He attributed his failures to having too little control over their nighttime activities; he tried evening rap groups and made himself available at all hours for [[talking therapies]] for their nocturnal [[anxiety attack]]s.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998/&gt; Landy went on to call his new system [[milieu therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Klosterman|first=Chuck|authorlink= Chuck Klosterman |title=Off-Key: Syd Barrett &amp;#124; b. 1946; Eugene Landy &amp;#124; b. 1934 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/magazine/31barrett_landy.t.html |quote=Landy's method of treatment (a system he called "milieu therapy") was extremely aggressive and adversarial; he threw water on the musician to get him out of bed.&amp;nbsp;... |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While serving the hospital, Landy became cultured in the lingo used by its teenagers.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998 /&gt; In 1971, he authored a book on hippie jargon called ''The Underground Dictionary'',&lt;ref name=Independent2006&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlin |first1=Peter Ames |authorlink1=Peter Ames Carlin |title=Obituaries: Eugene Landy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/eugene-landy-472307.html |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |date=April 1, 2006 |archivedate=October 23, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023180814/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/eugene-landy-472307.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Felton"/&gt; published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;ref name="GOKRS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Michael|title=God Only Knows|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 11, 1988|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/god-only-knows-19880811|others=[https://web.archive.org/web/19980630154243/http://www.petsounds.com/rs1.pdf Mirror]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1972, Landy founded a [[Beverly Hills]] clinic, the Foundation for the Rechanneling of Emotions and Education (FREE).&lt;ref name=Wilkinson1989 /&gt; Interns employed at the clinic used Landy's approach on a partial basis.{{sfn|Corsini|1981|p=876}} In the early 1970s, he also started penetrating Hollywood social circles, becoming a consultant on various television shows including ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998/&gt;&lt;ref name="GOKRS"/&gt; He soon began treating many celebrity clients, earning $200 an hour.&lt;ref name="GOKRS"/&gt;

Some of Landy's patients included [[Alice Cooper]], [[Richard Harris (actor)|Richard Harris]], [[Rod Steiger]], and [[Gig Young]], who died in an apparent murder-suicide along with his wife in 1978.&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit /&gt; In a 1976 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, "I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for some reason I seem to be able to relate to them.

===First treatment (1975–1976)===
[[File:Brian Wilson 1976.png|thumb|right|[[Brian Wilson]] producing [[the Beach Boys]]' album ''[[15 Big Ones]]'' in 1976]]

Landy was initially hired to treat Brian Wilson by Wilson's wife [[Marilyn Wilson|Marilyn]] in 1975.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=198–199}} Wilson publicly rebelled against the program, saying that the only reason that he went along with it was so that he would not be committed to a psychiatric facility.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998/&gt; Beach Boys road manager Rick Nelson later claimed that Landy had attempted to exert unwelcome artistic control over the group.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998/&gt; During the recording of the Beach Boys' album ''[[15 Big Ones]]'' (1976), group meetings were supervised by Landy, and discussions over each song for the record were reported to last for up to eight hours.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=358}} Another report suggested that Landy had asked for a percentage of the band's income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Michael|title=Dennis Wilson: The Beach Boy Who Went Overboard|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 7, 1984|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-beach-boy-who-went-overboard-19840607}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the command of Landy, Wilson appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', choosing to perform a solo piano rendition of "[[Good Vibrations]]" which received mixed feedback.&lt;ref name=White1977/&gt; Landy stood off-camera holding signs for Wilson that read "smile". He said that critics missed the point of this exercise, explaining that Wilson's performance "was a terrible thing" as a one-shot, but if he continued making appearances, then he would have gradually overcome his stage fright.&lt;ref name=White1977/&gt;

Steve Love, Wilson's cousin and band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998/&gt;{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=243–244}}&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit /&gt; Landy remembered ''15 Big Ones'' as "the only major success" the Beach Boys had in recent years; "Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I had to leave the situation. ... I was interested in making Brian a whole human being; they [the Beach Boys management] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977."&lt;ref name="WhiteBottom88"&gt;{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Timothy|authorlink1=Timothy White (writer)|title=BACK FROM THE BOTTOM|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/26/magazine/back-from-the-bottom.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 26, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, "I thought so, but there was nothing I could do about it and I eventually gave in to it.&amp;nbsp;... [He had] control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife.&amp;nbsp;... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged a hell of a lot per month."&lt;ref name=White1977&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Timothy|authorlink1=Timothy White (editor)|title=Beach Men: We Can Go Our Own Way|journal=[[Crawdaddy!]]|date=May 1977|page=64|url=https://40.media.tumblr.com/270f6e2d5aeee2d4b9dcdbd6fc4f2983/tumblr_ns217i96tO1trpswuo1_1280.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz.&lt;ref name=White1977/&gt; Schwartz died in a camping accident sometime after.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=291}}

===Second treatment (1983–1992)===
Five years later in 1982, Wilson was brought back to Landy's care after overdosing on a combination of alcohol, cocaine, and other psychoactive drugs.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"/&gt; Landy monitored Wilson's drug intake and used Sol Samuels to prescribe him medication. His assistant Kevin Leslie stood with Wilson at every moment, earning Leslie the nickname "[[Surf nazi|Surf Nazi]]". Leslie also gave Wilson medication at Landy's direction. Initially, Leslie was paid salary by Landy, but was eventually paid directly by Wilson.&lt;ref name="GOKRS"/&gt; In 1988, Samuels took credit with performing the "actual supervision of the therapy ... giving the medication and the occasional psychotherapy as he needs it. What Gene has been doing is hiring the people to be with him, and so forth, much as a parent would do if asked to get some help in the house."&lt;ref name="Spiller1998" /&gt;

In the mid 1980s, Landy stated of Wilson, "I influence all of his thinking. I'm practically a member of the band&amp;nbsp;... [We're] partners in life."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=244, 256}} Wilson later responded to allegations with, "People say that Dr. Landy runs my life, but the truth is, I'm in charge."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=257}} Landy echoed: "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody. ... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants."&lt;ref name="WhiteBottom88"/&gt; An August 1988 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' states the following:

{{quote|During the course of eight days spent with Landy and Wilson, it became clear just how much control Landy exerts over Brian's life. With the exception of taking a brief drive by himself to the market to pick up groceries, Brian appeared to be incapable of making a move without Landy's okay. During one interview session, the Landy line seemed to ring every thirty minutes. Yet Brian appears to be a willing participant in the program.&lt;ref name="GOKRS"/&gt;}}

Even though the Beach Boys had hired Landy, part of the regimen involved cutting Wilson's contact from the group, as Landy reasoned: "You can't deal with people who only want to use you."&lt;ref name="WhiteBottom88"/&gt; Wilson said that "Dr. Landy doesn't like me to be in touch with my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy."&lt;ref name="WhiteBottom88"/&gt; For example, Brian remembered participating in an interview with his brother [[Carl Wilson]], "and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten."&lt;ref name="WhiteBottom88"/&gt;

In 1986 Wilson met his future wife and manager [[Melinda Ledbetter]], a [[Cadillac]] saleswoman and former model, while browsing through a car dealership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=Jason|title=Brian Wilson's Summer Plans|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 8, 1999|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/brians-summer-plans-19990708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months after meeting Wilson, she had reported Landy to the state's [[attorney general]], who informed her that nothing could be done without the cooperation of Wilson's family. Ledbetter felt that the family had been at their "rope's end" with Wilson, and that they did not know what to do to help him. She said that three years into their relationship, Landy ordered Wilson to sever ties with Ledbetter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mason|first1=Anthony|authorlink1=Anthony Mason (journalist)|title=Brian Wilson's summer of milestones|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/brian-wilsons-summer-of-milestones/|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music and business assocations====
{{See also|Sweet Insanity}}

Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually, forcing Wilson's family members to devote some publishing rights to his fee.&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit /&gt; Landy received 25% of the copyright to all of Wilson's songs, regardless of whether he contributed to them or not, which band manager Tom Hulett explained was an incentive for Landy to reignite Wilson's drive. "It was sort of like, 'Gee, there's nothing coming in now, if you can go make this person well to go create some income&amp;nbsp;...'"&lt;ref name=Spiller1998 /&gt; Landy expressed similar views. "Saying that [I would share in future songwriting royalties] in '84 was like me telling you, 'I'll pay you a million dollars if you can get up and fly around the room.'"&lt;ref name=LA1991 /&gt; This arrangement was revoked in 1985, with Landy only receiving rights with a percentage equal to his writing contributions.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998 /&gt; Landy reported that he never received any money, since Wilson had not published any material before the pact was voided.&lt;ref name=LA1991 /&gt; Afterward, Wilson paid Landy a salary of about $300,000 a year for advice on creative decisions.&lt;ref name=LA1991/&gt;

In late 1987, Landy and Wilson became creative partners in a company called Brains and Genius, a business venture where each member would contribute equally and share any profits from recordings, films, soundtracks, or books.&lt;ref name=LA1991/&gt; Landy was then credited as co-writer and executive producer for Wilson's debut solo album, ''[[Brian Wilson (album)|Brian Wilson]]'', released in 1988.&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit /&gt; Co-producer [[Russ Titelman]] disparaged Landy's role in the album's creation, calling him disruptive and "anti-creative".&lt;ref name=Spiller1998 /&gt; Wilson's cousin and bandmate [[Mike Love]] denied Landy's claims that the Beach Boys were preventing Wilson from participating on their recordings, and believed that the reason Landy encouraged Wilson to pursue a solo career "was to destroy us. Then he would be the sole custodian of Brian's career and legacy."{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=333–334}} Landy maintained that his songwriting collaborations on ''Brian Wilson'' earned him less than $50,000.&lt;ref name=LA1991 /&gt;

For the publishing of Wilson's autobiographic memoir, ''[[Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story]]'', Landy stood to earn 30% of its proceeds.&lt;ref name=PhillyBlues1991&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heller|first1=Karen|title=A Beach Boy's Blues For Brian Wilson, The Days Of "Fun, Fun, Fun" Have Ebbed.

Landy denied accusations that he was involved as a [[ghostwriter]]. Wilson later distanced himself from the book.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=63, 272–273}}  In a 1995 court case, Wilson's lawyers argued that [[HarperCollins]] were aware that Wilson's statements in the book were either manipulated or written by Landy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffin|first1=Gil|title=Brian Wilson's Mom Sues Her Son's Publisher; Claims Libel|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 29, 1995|volume=107|issue=30|pages=10, 32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State intervention====

Action was taken against Landy's professional practice as a result of the Beach Boys' and Wilson family's struggles for control.&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit /&gt; A former nurse and girlfriend of Wilson's brought Landy to the state's attention in 1984. The state was then aided by journals written by songwriter [[Gary Usher]] during a ten-month collaboration with Wilson. These journals depicted Wilson as a virtual captive dominated by Landy, who was determined to fulfill his show business ambitions through Wilson.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998/&gt; By this time, Wilson had become Landy's only patient.&lt;ref name=LA1991&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hilburn|first1=Robert|title=Landy's Account of the Wilson Partnership|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-13/entertainment/ca-1172_1_brian-wilson|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 13, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1988, the State of California Board of Medical Quality charged Landy with ethical and license code violations stemming from the improper prescription of drugs and various unethical personal and professional relationships with patients, citing one case of sexual misconduct with a female patient, along with Wilson's [[psychological dependency]] on Landy.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spiller|first1=Nancy|title=Bad Vibrations|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-06-26/magazine/tm-8498_1_eugene-landy|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 26, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landy denied the allegations, but later admitted to one of the seven charges which accused him of wrongfully prescribing drugs to Wilson. Landy surrendered his psychological license, complying with an agreement made with the state of California, and was not allowed applications for reinstatement for the next two years.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson1989&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Tracy|title=Beach Boy Brian Wilson's Psychologist Loses License|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-01/local/me-850_1_brian-wilson|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 1, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

An August 1988 board meeting with the Beach Boys had Landy promising that Brian would reconnect with the group, which Love says: "was a ruse to get us to write a letter in his defense against the California authorities. We never wrote the letter, and Brian's public behavior continued to unsettle."{{sfn|Love|2016|p=367}} Landy and his colleagues claimed that his treatment of Wilson ended in February 1988 at the request of the state attorney general's office, but the deputy attorney who drafted the complaint reported that he was not aware of any such request, nor was the office advised that they sever Landy's relationship with Wilson.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998 /&gt; Co-producers of Wilson's solo album said they witnessed no changes, and Landy's assistants remained with Wilson. Sol Samuels said this was because Landy had little direct involvement with Wilson's treatment, and that it was instead the people Landy hired who continued to regulate Wilson's medication.&lt;ref name=Spiller1998 /&gt;

According to songwriter [[P. F. Sloan]], Landy took advantage of Sloan's disappearance and claimed at one point to be the real P. F. Sloan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenblatt|first1=Mike|title=Perception is reality for singer-songwriter P.F.

====Conservatorship hearings====
[[File:Brian Wilson 2009.png|thumb|upright|Wilson in 2009]]

Peter Reum, a therapist who met Wilson while attending a Beach Boys fan convention in 1990, was alarmed by Wilson's demeanor and speculated that he may be suffering from [[tardive dyskinesia]], a neurological condition brought on by prolonged usage of [[antipsychotic medication]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=271}} Reum phoned biographer [[David Leaf]], who then reported Reum's observations to Carl Wilson.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=272}} It was then discovered that Landy had been named as a chief beneficiary in a 1989 revision of Brian's will,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=272}} collecting 70%, with the remainder split between his girlfriend and Brian's two daughters.&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit /&gt; This discovery was made by Kay Gilmer, a publicist employed by Landy in March 1990. She phoned Gary Usher to explain why his messages were not being returned, to which Usher warned: "If Landy knows that you're calling me, he'd kill you. He'd literally kill you."{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=345–349}} Gilmer left her job two weeks later, taking expired drug bottles as well as names, phone numbers, and bank account information that she later turned over to the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance.{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=345–349}}

Aided by Gilmer's findings,{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=345–349}} Brian's cousin [[Stan Love (basketball)|Stan Love]] filed unsuccessfully for [[conservatorship]] on May 17, 1990.&lt;ref name=LA1991 /&gt; A press conference with Stan at the lectern featured an unexpected appearance from Brian. While reading from a piece of paper, Brian was given a microphone and said: "I have heard of the charges made by Stan Love, and I think they are outrageous, which means they are out of the ballpark&amp;nbsp;... I feel great."{{sfn|Love|2016|p=343}}  Audree, Carl, [[Carnie Wilson|Carnie]], and [[Wendy Wilson]] then contested Landy's control of Brian, pursuing legal action on May 7, 1991.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=375}} The ruling was finalized on February 3, 1992 when Landy was barred by court order from contacting Brian, leaving his affairs to the hands of conservator Jerome S. Billet.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=273}} In December 1992, Landy was fined $1,000 for violating the court order when he visited Brian in June for his birthday.&lt;ref name="NYTimesFox"&gt;{{cite web|first=Margalit|last=Fox|title=Eugene Landy, Therapist to Beach Boys' Leader, Dies at 71|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/30/arts/music/30landy.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=March 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Love &amp; Mercy''===

Landy's treatment of Wilson in the 1980s was dramatized in the 2014 [[biographical film]] ''[[Love &amp; Mercy (film)|Love &amp; Mercy]]'', in which Landy is portrayed by [[Paul Giamatti]]. These events are told from the point of view of Wilson's then-girlfriend Melinda Ledbetter.

Screenwriter [[Oren Moverman]] stated that virtually everything in the 1980s portions was sourced from conversations he had with Ledbetter. He felt that Landy was the most difficult character to write for, "even though many things that he says in the movie I actually have recording of, in real life he was a cartoon and in real life he was so over the top."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weintraub|first1=Steve|title=LOVE &amp; MERCY Screenwriter Oren Moverman on Brian Wilson's Mythology, Fact vs. Fiction, and More|url=http://collider.com/love-and-mercy-oren-moverman-on-making-a-cinematic-brian-williams-biopic/|publisher=Collider|date=June 6, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150607113013/http://collider.com/love-and-mercy-oren-moverman-on-making-a-cinematic-brian-williams-biopic/|archivedate=June 7, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giamatti said he prepared for the role by meeting Landy's early career acquaintances and listening to hours of tapes where "he'd just keep talking and talking, in these completely huge paragraphs.

==Personal life and death==

Landy had one son in the early 1960s,&lt;ref name=Spiller1998/&gt; Evan Landy.&lt;ref name=Whitall2015/&gt;{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=342}}

After the 1990s, Landy continued a [[psychotherapeutic]] practice with licensure in [[New Mexico]] and Hawaii up until his death.

In 1995, music producer [[Don Was]] commented that Wilson was "so different from his public image as a drug burnout or of someone catatonic and propped up by a greedy psychologist. ... I knew Landy.

&lt;!-- [[Image:Fathi-Arafat.jpg|thumb|right|Fathi Arafat]] --&gt;
'''Fathi Arafat''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: فتحي عرفات; January 11, 1933 &amp;ndash; December 1, 2004), born in [[Cairo]], was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] physician&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9906002&lt;/ref&gt; and a founder and long-term chairman of the Palestine [[Red Crescent]] Society. He studied [[medicine]] at [[Cairo University]] from 1950 until 1957 and thereafter practiced as a pediatrician in [[Cairo]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Jordan]]. He was a younger brother of Palestinian president [[Yasser Arafat]].

Arafat became a member of the [[Palestinian National Council]] in 1967. From 1968 he was also President of Palestine General Union of Physicians and Pharmacists. He served as Chief Delegate for Palestine to the [[World Health Organization]] in [[Geneva]] from 1982 onwards. From 1992 he was President of the [[Palestine Academy for Science and Technology]] (formerly Palestine Academy for Scientific Research) and President of the [[Palestine Higher Health Council]].

He died in [[Cairo]] on December 1, 2004, from [[stomach cancer]], less than a month after the death of Yasser Arafat.

In [[Latin America]], the [[Central America]]n countries of [[Guatemala]], and [[Honduras]], and the [[Caribbean]] countries of [[Haiti]], and the [[Dominican Republic]] have national [[HIV]] prevalence of over 1%. In these countries, HIV-infected men outnumber HIV-infected women by roughly 3:1. Low prevalence in other countries disguises serious, localized epidemics. In [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]] and [[Argentina]], [[intravenous drug use]] and [[Homosexuality|homosexual activity]] are the main modes of transmission, and there is concern that [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual activity]] may soon become a primary method of spreading the virus.

In 2015, the prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] in the [[United Kingdom]] was estimated at 101,200 (0.16% of the population), 13% of whom are unaware of their infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/western-central-europe-north-america/uk|title=HIV and AIDS in the United Kingdom (UK)|date=2015-07-21|work=AVERT|access-date=2017-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/602942/HIV_in_the_UK_report.pdf|title=HIV in the UK|last=|first=|date=2016-12-01|website=UK Government|publisher=Public Health England|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tht.org.uk/our-charity/Facts-and-statistics-about-HIV/HIV-in-the-UK|title=HIV in the UK {{!}} Terrence Higgins Trust|last=Trust|first=Terrence Higgins|website=www.tht.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nat.org.uk/we-inform/HIV-statistics/UK-statistics|title=UK HIV Statistics {{!}} National AIDS Trust - NAT|website=www.nat.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prevalence is highest in gay/bisexual men in [[London]] with an estimated 1 in 7 living with HIV.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;However, the 2018 statistics showed tremendous decrease in the number of HIV infected gay men during 2015-2017.The number of HIV infected gay men decreased by a third in just two years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aidsmap.com/HIV-diagnoses-in-gay-men-in-the-UK-decreased-by-a-third-in-two-years/page/3333191/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overall demographics ==
An estimated 101,200 people are living with HIV in the UK. Of those, 69% are men and 31% were women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Just under half of those living with HIV are gay or bisexual men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 1 in 7 gay or bisexual men in London are living with HIV, compared to 1 in 25 in the rest of the UK and less than 1 in 500 for the general population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== New diagnoses ==
6095 people were newly diagnosed during 2015, a trend which has remained relatively constant since 2010.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/602945/HIV_diagnoses_late_diagnoses_and_numbers_accessing_treatment_and_care.pdf|title=HIV diagnoses, late diagnoses and numbers accessing treatment and care|last=|first=|date=October 2016|website=UK Government|publisher=Public Health England|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 39% of diagnoses were late (likely to have been living with the virus for over three years).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This has improved since 2006 when 56% of people were diagnosed late. Late diagnosis is associated with a 10-fold increase in the chance of death during the first year after diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/HIV/&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of new diagnoses (3,320) were among gay or bisexual men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There has been a decrease in diagnoses amongst heterosexual black African men and women, from 73% in 2006 to 47% in 2015, largely due to trends in migration from high prevalence countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Treatment and prognosis ==
HIV treatment is available free of charge in the UK and as a result 96% of diagnosed are receiving treatment and of those 94% have a suppressed viral load making them very unlikely to pass on the infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tht.org.uk/our-charity/Media-centre/Press-Releases/2016/July/Effective-HIV-treatment-means-%E2%80%98zero%E2%80%99-risk-of-transmitting-virus|title=Effective HIV treatment means ‘zero’ risk of transmitting virus {{!}} Terrence Higgins Trust|last=Trust|first=Terrence Higgins|website=www.tht.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tht.org.uk/sexual-health/About-HIV/Can_apos_t-Pass-It-On|title=Can't Pass It On {{!}} Terrence Higgins Trust|last=Trust|first=Terrence Higgins|website=www.tht.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, less than 1% of people living with a diagnosed HIV infection in the UK died (cause of death is uncertain and may not be HIV-related). All-cause mortality for ages 15–59 in people living with HIV was 5.7 per 1000 compared to 1.7 for the UK population as a whole.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People newly diagnosed with HIV today can expect to have a normal life expectancy if they are diagnosed on time and on effective treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39872530|title=HIV life expectancy 'near normal' thanks to new drugs|last=Roxby|first=Philippa|date=2017-05-11|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, one in four adults seen for HIV care were 50 years of age or older. This is partly due to improvements to life expectancy for people living with HIV as well as increasing numbers of people acquiring HIV later in life.

=== Pre-exposure prophylaxis ===
{{see also|National AIDS Trust v NHS Service Commissioning Board}}

'''Hopkins syndrome''' is a [[neurological disorder]]. Its cause has not been established, but its association with asthma exacerbations (usually with a respiratory infection as a trigger) has led to suspicion that the initial viral insult that causes the respiratory infection is also implicated in the subsequent paralysis. [[Herpes simplex virus]] type I DNA has been found in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of at least one patient diagnosed with Hopkins syndrome.&lt;ref name=Kyllerman&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0887-8994(93)90091-P | last1 = Kyllerman | first1 = MG | last2 = Herner | first2 = S | last3 = Bergström | first3 = TB | last4 = Ekholm | first4 = SE | title = PCR diagnosis of primary herpesvirus type I in poliomyelitis-like paralysis and respiratory tract disease | journal = Pediatric neurology | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 227–9 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8394714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In several cases, anti-viral antibody titers for [[echovirus]], [[enterovirus]], [[coxsackievirus]] and [[poliovirus]] types 1, 2 and 3 were specifically sought; all were negative.&lt;ref name=Okayama&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Okayama | first1 = A | last2 = Hara | first2 = H | last3 = Shigeto | first3 = H | last4 = Yamada | first4 = T | last5 = Kira | first5 = J | title = A case of Hopkins syndrome with onset at puberty | journal = [[Rinsho Shinkeigaku]] | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 452–5 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10391972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=Kurokawa&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kurokawa | first1 = T | last2 = Taniwaki | first2 = T | last3 = Arakawa | first3 = K | last4 = Yamada | first4 = T | last5 = Kira | first5 = J | title = An adult case of recurrent myelopathy presenting with monoplegia following asthmatic attacks | journal = Fukuoka igaku zasshi = Hukuoka acta medica | volume = 91 | issue = 3 | pages = 85–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10826222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is one reported case in which ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'' infection was found in the patient.&lt;ref name=Acharya&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0887-8994(96)00248-2 | last1 = Acharya | first1 = AB | last2 = Lakhani | first2 = PK | title = Hopkins syndrome associated with Mycoplasma infection | journal = Pediatric neurology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–5 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9044403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The syndrome appears to involve the [[spinal cord]]: specifically, the [[Anterior horn of spinal cord|anterior horn cells]] subserving the affected muscles are often damaged. The evidence for anterior horn cell involvement comes from [[Radiology|radiological]] &lt;ref name="Kurokawa"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=Nakano&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nakano | first1 = Y | last2 = Kohira | first2 = R | last3 = Yamazaki | first3 = H | last4 = Fujita | first4 = N | last5 = Fuchigami | first5 = T | last6 = Okubo | first6 = O | last7 = Harada | first7 = K | title = Hopkins syndrome: oral prednisolone was effective for the paralysis | journal = No to hattatsu.

As the illness is rare, no treatments have been subjected to a [[randomized controlled trial]]. [[Acyclovir]],&lt;ref name="Kyllerman"/&gt; [[steroid]]s and therapeutic [[plasma exchange]] have been tried; one report suggests that the latter is more effective than steroidal therapy.&lt;ref name=Kira&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kira | first1 = J | title = Neural damage associated with allergic diseases: pathomechanism and therapy | journal = [[Rinsho Shinkeigaku]] | volume = 43 | issue = 11 | pages = 756–60 | year = 2003 | pmid = 15152457 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prognosis for recovery of function of the affected limbs is generally considered to be poor.

'''Jessica Hamby''' is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[True Blood]]'' series, portrayed by [[Deborah Ann Woll]]. In the series, which chronicles the life of human waitress [[Sookie Stackhouse]] and her friends after [[vampires]] make themselves known to humans. Jessica is a newly turned vampire who must learn to deal with her vampiric abilities, weaknesses, and altered lifestyle.

==Character biography==
[[File:Deborah Ann Woll by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|[[Deborah Ann Woll]] portrays Jessica Hamby]]
In her human life, Jessica was raised in a strict, devout Christian family in [[Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]]. Jessica and her younger sister Eden were [[homeschooled]] and only allowed to go to [[Bible study (Christian)|bible study]] and [[clarinet]] lessons. Her father would often beat Jessica with his belt to punish her for her faults. Jessica's mother was oblivious to this abuse - in a later episode, Jessica attributed this to her mother's "stupidness".{{ref|Keep this Party Going|E-14}} Jessica resented the restrictions of her life dearly and secretly developed a rebellious attitude to her father's dominance, it’s also hinted that she might’ve been bullied by peers which might’ve further increased her frustration with the world around her. Shortly before her appearance in ''True Blood'', she chooses to sneak out after her bible study to attend a friend's party. In events off-screen, she was subsequently attacked &amp; kidnapped by vampires and brought to the scene of a vampire trial, where the Magister, the enforcer of vampire justice, intended to use her as part of a sentence for a vampire on trial.{{ref|I Don't Wanna Know|E-10}}

==Plot synopsis==
===Season 1===

While she is still human, Jessica is brought to a vampire trial. At this trial, the Magister (enforcer of vampire law) is reviewing the case of [[Bill Compton (The Southern Vampire Mysteries)|Bill Compton]], who murdered another vampire that was trying to kill his girlfriend [[Sookie Stackhouse]]. The Magister decides that as a punishment for his deeds, Bill is to "create" a new vampire, and therefore presents him with a terrified human Jessica. Bill is reluctant but willingly goes along with the sentence as The Magister would torture her and make him watch, draining the struggling Jessica of all her blood and burying her underground with him for one night. This process transforms Jessica into a vampire successfully, but she is under the reign of her "maker", Bill, to which she does not take kindly. Jessica at first is saddened at the fact she can never go back to her family and live a normal life but immediately cheers over her new-found freedom and enhanced abilities.{{ref|I Don't Wanna Know|E-10}} Bill teaches her to drink synthetic blood, as opposed to human blood, but Jessica doesn't like the synthetic blood. Eventually, she becomes such an obstacle to Bill that he leaves her to his vampire sheriff, [[Eric Northman]] (who she is attracted to), excited at the fact that she gets to feed off Humans and spend time with him she agrees. However, Eric grows tired of her as well and once again leaves her with Bill.

===Season 2===
Sookie befriends Jessica and they bond over the grief they feel after having lost their family. Jessica feigns sympathy, and convinces Sookie to take her to see Jessica's family, but Jessica enters her old home, going against what she promised to Sookie, and confronts her father when he prepares to strike her with his belt in retaliation for being away for so long. Jessica states that her family is sick and that she desires to kill her father, but Bill intervenes and saves Jessica's family from harm, later erasing their memories and realizing her human life is over.{{ref|Keep this Party Going|E-14}} After this, Jessica gradually begins to understand how to be a good vampire and starts a relationship with a human from Bill's hometown, Hoyt Fortenberry.{{ref|Scratches|E-15}} At Carmilla Hotel, both admit they are still virgins and Hoyt covers the bed with rose petals before the two finally make love. Later in the series, as Jessica starts to have sex with Hoyt, she realizes her hymen has regenerated to its virginal state and she will always be a "vampire virgin". They break up briefly because of a conflict between Jessica and Hoyt's overbearing mother, Maxine, who is prejudiced against vampires, but eventually reconcile.

===Season 3===
Jessica drains a trucker, killing him. She quickly regrets it and tries to heal him, but it doesn't work. Jessica is confronted by a vampire named Franklin, who pulls the truckers severed head from a paper bag. He tells Jessica he will help keep the corpse a secret in exchange for information on Bill Compton. Jessica is hired by Sam as a hostess at Merlotte's. While working, Jessica runs into Chip, an old classmate from Bible study. He is stunned to see her alive since her parents have been telling people she is dead. Jessica glamours Chip and convinces him that he never saw her. After a fight with Arlene, Jessica glamours all her customers not to tip her. She later regrets it and glamours the last customer into giving Arlene a big tip- after Jessica successfully feeds on the woman, without harming her.

After Bill returns to Bon Temps, he releases her as her maker. Jessica not wanting to be alone however, declines to leave. The two reconcile and Bill trains Jessica to fight vampires and werewolves. Later that night, Jessica and Bill fight two werewolves in Sookie's house. After one escapes outside, Jessica follows him. She's captured by Russell, who bites her in front of Bill. He convinces Russell to let her go. Jessica captured the werewolf and drank from him. Hoyt shows up at Merlotte's with his new girlfriend Summer, and the couple are seated by a visibly upset Jessica. Hoyt tells Jessica he still has feelings for her and doesn't like Summer. Jessica becomes emotional, and Tommy Mickens only sees the end of the conversation which adds to his hatred of Hoyt. Hoyt tells Jessica that he loves her before he leaves Merlottes. As he leaves, he is attacked by Tommy (who has shifted into his dog form). Jessica comes to the rescue, telling Hoyt she loves him too. Injured, Hoyt drinks from Jessica so his wounds will heal.

After Russell's appearance on TBBN, humans burn a cross on Bill and Jessica's front lawn. Jessica wants to hunt them down, but Bill convinces her that now is not the time for revenge. Jessica and Hoyt get back together. They tell each other how badly they missed one another. When things start getting serious, Jessica tells him about killing the trucker. She explains she's not going to stop drinking human blood and Hoyt immediately offers his own neck. Jessica goes right for it and Hoyt seems to like the experience. At the end of the season she is seen moving into a small house with Hoyt. The camera pans away to show a small voo-doo like doll on the floor. Maxine and Summer are also seen purchasing guns and wooden bullets at a nearby gun shop.

===Season 4===
Jessica and Hoyt are seen living together for over a year. After working all day, Hoyt becomes angry with Jessica for not cooking him dinner, and really doesn’t like how dependent Hoyt is toward her, but he reminds her that she lives in his home and she feeds on him.  The brief fight ends with the two laughing over a plate of uncooked eggs.  Later, Hoyt brings Jessica to Fangtasia for a date night. Jessica flirts with other men which Pam describes as "you've been eye-fucking every fang-banger in the place."

Jessica has the urge to go back to Fangtasia. She leaves to buy Hoyt some Advil, but after seeing a sign to Shreveport, she heads to Fangtasia. As soon as she enters, she approaches the young guy she saw while there with Hoyt. She feeds on him in the bathroom. Sookie, who is also there, confronts Jessica. She quickly tells Sookie to mind her own business.

Feeling guilty for biting another human, Jessica goes to her maker Bill for advice. She returns home to tell Hoyt the truth. Hurt and angry, Hoyt and Jessica argue before she decides to glamour him into forgetting.

In a later episode, Hoyt and Jessica find Jason Stackhouse passed out and injured on the side of a road. Jessica quickly helps him by giving him her blood, healing him. Because she gave him her blood she is able to sense him and how he is feeling. In episode 6 of season 4 Jessica finds Jason in the woods panicked about turning into a werepanther (which he doesn't turn into in the end). She helps calm him down and talks to him for a while. The two part ways some time later but it is obvious that there is something going on between them, unspoken tension. Jessica later breaks up with Hoyt and moves back into Bill's house. Jason later comes by to drop off a box of Jessica's things from Hoyt's, and they end up having sex in the back of Jason's pick up truck.

On Halloween night, Jessica shows up on Jason's doorstep dressed in a sexy Halloween costume and the two make love but not form a relationship, though Jason boosts her confidence.

===Season 5=== 
 
Jason is glamoured into listening to newly vampire Steve Newlin's story: he is [[Homosexual|gay]] and claims to be in love with Jason, who wants nothing to do with Newlin. Angered, Newlin attacks Jason and tries to bite him. Jessica then appears and threatens Newlin by saying that she has claimed Jason, Later, while partying with College students, when Jason comes in, still having feelings for her. After playing [[Guitar Hero]], Jason tries to make a move on Jessica, but she rejects him, and makes out with a college guy, making Jason jealous. Jason then brings one of the girls with him to have sex, but instead takes her to her home, while Jessica watches him leave, wordless. Jessica develops a personality similar to Pam’s such as dressing sexy, talking down to others and hitting on as many guys as she can , Jessica tries to befriend the newly turned [[Tara Thornton|Tara]], however the two come to blows over Tara's attempt to go too far drinking Hoyt, who has become a "fang-banger".

While at Fangtasia another night, she is seduced by a young man and leaves the bar with him. She is then captured by a human supremacists group who have been responsible for the recent killings of  super natural beings. Hoyt, who unknowingly became friends with members of the group, is brought in to kill Jessica for breaking his heart. They are locked in a room together with a guard outside; making it impossible to escape unless Hoyt kills her, there Jessica admits she no longer loved him when she cheated on him with Jason and might never love him again, Hoyt shoots the gun so that the guard will open the door, and Jessica is able to break the guard's neck.  Hoyt goes to get help, as Jessica cannot leave during the day and she thanks him for not killing her, and Hoyt threatens to kill her for real if he sees her again. After both Hoyt and Sookie are rescued from the hate group, Hoyt tells Jason and Jessica that he plans to move to Alaska to start a new life, but wants Jessica to glamour him first. Tearfully, Jessica erases all of Hoyt's memories of his friendship with Jason, and their relationship as well. She then goes back to Bill's house.

==Relationships==
===Bill Compton===
Bill is Jessica's maker, but they do not have a good start: he was reluctant to "create" her and she does not find him a good teacher, calling him "boring" and feeling that he is holding her back from acting like a true vampire. Over time, she learns to follow his commands and he teaches her how to "glamour" (very effective vampire hypnosis techniques) and how to fight. As he disappears at the beginning of [[True Blood (season 3)|season 3]], Jessica is very frightened and lost and displays great relief upon Bill's return. Bill does start to care for Jessica as he saves her life later on. In season 4, their relationship becomes stronger, despite him having released her, and she starts to see Bill more like a 'parent', while Bill sees her as his progeny even grieving when he thought she met her demise by a witch's spell.

===Hoyt Fortenberry===
Jessica meets Hoyt, a road crew worker, in the bar of Bill's hometown, Merlotte's. They have a conversation at the bar, then meet up at Bill's house, where Jessica lives. Jessica is very straightforward about her sexual desires, but Hoyt is a little reluctant. Bill breaks the duo up and forbids them from seeing each other, but as he takes Jessica with him on a trip to [[Dallas]], Hoyt eventually shows up at Jessica's door and they ignite their romance. Jessica comes into conflict with Hoyt's overbearing mother Maxine, who disapproves of their relationship and is prejudiced against vampires. Later on, Maxine comes under the influence of a [[maenad]] and loses her limitations, after which she starts dishing out her true opinion on Jessica. Jessica attacks her, so Hoyt breaks up with her.  In Season 3 he attempts to get back together with her but she refuses, as she is afraid of her vampire nature.  However, after she saves Hoyt from an attack by a [[shapeshifter]], they reconcile. They take their relationship to the next level; Hoyt tells Jessica he intends to marry her, and the two move in together in a new house. In season 4, however, a year into their relationship it has deteriorated. Hoyt and Jessica both have different needs and Jessica cheats on Hoyt twice (first with a random fangbanger, then by kissing Jason after he saved her life). Jessica contemplates leaving Hoyt, but when she does, he reacts angrily and cruelly reminds her of her shortcomings (such as her inability to have children) before kicking her out. She tries to seek Jason's help, but he rejects her also as he chooses his best friend's - Hoyt's - side.  Jason eventually gives in to his feelings for Jessica, which earns the enmity of both Hoyt and Jason's former friends.  Struggling with the pain of the breakup, Hoyt eventually asks Jessica to "glamour" or hypnotize away all his memories of her and Jason before he moves to Alaska.  Hoyt returns in season 7, with his new girlfriend, Brigette.  He meets Jessica again after saving her life from a sadistic vampire named Violet.  She eventually falls for him again and tells him their story, accepting responsibility for the failure of their first relationship.  Hoyt again has feelings for her, despite having only just "met" her.  Jessica and Hoyt are married shortly after.

===Jason Stackhouse===
In season 4, Jessica begins to show interest in Jason Stackhouse. After Jason escapes from Hotshot, Jessica and Hoyt find him. Jessica gives Jason her blood to heal him, which causes him to develop romantic and sexual feelings for her. She comes to his rescue as he is in the woods with full moon and later on, he saves her as she is about to meet the sun under a witch' curse. Jason rejects Jessica after she breaks up with his best friend Hoyt, but later on they give in to their feelings and have sex.  Afterward, Jason confesses that he feels guilty for betraying Hoyt, briefly souring their relationship.  After Jason is nearly killed in an explosion and is again saved by drinking Jessica's blood, the two reconcile.  On Halloween night Jessica comes to Jason's house and seduces him; later she tells Jason that she doesn't want to enter into a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, at least not yet, which Jason reluctantly agrees to.  Their relationship ultimately ends as what they describe as a "beautiful friendship," when she is reunited with Hoyt and eventually marries him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19056">Many [[laboratories]] contain significant risks, and the prevention of '''laboratory accidents''' requires great care and constant vigilance. Examples of risk factors include high voltages, high and low pressures and temperatures, corrosive and toxic chemicals, and [[biohazard]]s including infective organisms and their toxins.

Measures to protect against laboratory accidents include safety training and enforcement of laboratory safety policies, safety review of experimental designs, the use of [[personal protective equipment]], and the use of the [[buddy system]] for particularly risky operations.

In many countries, laboratory work is subject by health and safety legislation. In some cases, laboratory activities can also present [[environmental health]] risks, for example, the accidental or deliberate discharge of toxic or infective material from the laboratory into the environment.

== Chemical hazards ==
Hazardous [[chemicals]] present physical and/or health threats to workers in clinical, industrial, and academic laboratories. Laboratory chemicals include [[cancer]]-causing agents (carcinogens), toxins (e.g., those affecting the [[liver]], [[kidney]], and [[nervous system]]), irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, as well as agents that act on the blood system or damage the [[lungs]], [[skin]], [[eye]]s, or [[mucous membrane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sp.ehs.cornell.edu/lab-research-safety/laboratory-safety-manual/Pages/ch8.aspx|title = Chapter 8 - Chemical Hazards|website = sp.ehs.cornell.edu|access-date = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological hazards ==
[[File:Biohazard symbol (black and yellow).png|thumb|Biohazard symbol (black and yellow)]]

=== Biological agents and biological toxins ===
Many laboratory workers encounter daily exposure to biological hazards. These hazards are present in various sources throughout the laboratory such as [[blood]] and [[body fluids]], culture specimens, [[body tissue]] and [[cadavers]], and [[laboratory animals]], as well as other workers.

These are federally regulated biological agents (e.g., [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[prions]]) and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety, to animal or plant health, or to animal or plant products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/biologicalagents/index.html | title=Biological Agents and Biological Toxins | publisher=[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] | accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/pandemicflu/index.html | title=An additional OSHA Safety and Health Topics page on Pandemic Influenza has been added in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. | publisher=[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] | accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''[[Anthrax]]''' - Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by a spore-forming bacterium called ''Bacillus anthracis''.
#'''Avian Flu''' - [[Avian influenza]] is caused by ''Influenza A viruses''.
#'''[[Botulism]]''' - Cases of botulism are usually associated with consumption of preserved foods.
#'''Foodborne Disease''' - Foodborne illnesses are caused by [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], [[parasites]], toxins, [[metals]], and [[prions]] (microscopic protein particles). Symptoms range from mild gastroenteritis to life-threatening neurologic, hepatic and renal syndromes.
#'''Hantavirus''' - Hantaviruses are transmitted to humans from the dried droppings, urine, or saliva of mice and rats.
#'''Legionnaires’ Disease''' - Legionnaires’ disease is a bacterial disease commonly associated with water-based aerosols.
#'''[[Molds]] and [[Fungi]]''' - Molds and fungi produce and release millions of spores small enough to be [[air]], [[water]], or insect-borne which may have negative effects on human health including, allergic reactions, asthma, and other respiratory problems.
#'''[[Plague (disease)|Plague]]''' - The [[World Health Organization]] reports 1,000 to 3,000 cases of plague every year. A bioterrorist release of plague could result in a rapid spread of the pneumonic form of the disease, which could have devastating consequences.
#'''Ricin''' - Ricin is one of the most toxic and easily produced plant toxins. It has been used in the past as a bioterrorist weapon and remains a serious threat.
#'''[[Smallpox]]''' - Smallpox is a highly contagious disease unique to humans. It is estimated that no more than 20 percent of the population has any immunity from previous vaccination.
#'''[[Tularemia]]''' - Tularemia is also known as "rabbit fever" or "deer fly fever" and is extremely infectious. Relatively few bacteria are required to cause the disease, which is why it is an attractive weapon for use in bioterrorism.

== Physical hazards and others ==
Besides exposure to chemicals and biological agents, laboratory workers can also be exposed to a number of physical hazards. Some of the common physical hazards that they may encounter include the following: [[ergonomic]], [[ionizing radiation]], non-ionizing
radiation and noise hazards.

=== Ergonomic Hazards ===
Laboratory workers are at risk for repetitive motion injuries during routine laboratory procedures such as pipetting, working at microscopes, operating microtomes, using cell counters and keyboarding at computer workstations. Repetitive motion injuries develop over time and occur when muscles and joints are stressed, tendons are inflamed, nerves are pinched and the flow of blood is restricted. Standing and working in awkward positions in front of laboratory hoods/biological safety cabinets can also present ergonomic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAfactsheet-laboratory-safety-ergonomics.pdf | title=Laboratory Safety – Ergonomics for the Prevention of Musculoskeletal Disorders | publisher=OSHA | accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darragh AR, Harrison H, Kenny S. Effect of ergonomics intervention on workstations of microscope workers. American Journal of Occupational Therapy. 2008. 62:61-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ionizing Radiation ===
[[File:ISO 7010 W003.svg|thumb|Danger radiation zone warning sign]]
Ionizing radiation sources are found in a wide range of occupational settings, including laboratories. These radiation sources can pose a considerable health risk to affected workers if not properly controlled. Any laboratory possessing or using radioactive isotopes must be licensed by the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) and/or by a state agency that has been approved by the NRC, 10 CFR 31.11 and 10 CFR 35.12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/radiationionizing/index.html | title=Ionizing Radiation | accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental objectives of radiation protection measures are:

#to limit entry of radionuclides into the [[human body]] (via [[ingestion]], [[inhalation]], [[absorption (skin)|absorption]], or through open wounds) to quantities as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) and always within the established limits;

#to limit exposure to external radiation to levels that are within established dose limits and as far below these limits as is reasonably achievable.

== Safety hazards ==

=== Autoclaves and sterilizers === 
Workers should be trained to recognize the potential for exposure to burns or cuts that can occur from handling or sorting hot sterilized items or sharp instruments when removing them from '''[[autoclaves]]'''/'''[[sterilizers]]''' or from steam lines that service the autoclaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov | title=An OSHA QuickFacts entitled '''Laboratory Safety – Autoclaves/Sterilizers''' has been developed to sup-plement this section and is available online at osha.gov. | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Centrifuges ===
'''[[Centrifuges]]''', due to the high speed at which they operate, have great potential for injuring users if not operated properly. Unbalanced centrifuge rotors can result in injury, even death. Sample container breakage can generate aerosols that may be harmful if inhaled.
The majority of all centrifuge accidents are the result of user error.

=== Compressed gases ===
[[File:Compressed gas cylinders.mapp and oxygen.triddle.jpg|thumb|Compressed gas cylinders.mapp and oxygen.triddle]]
Laboratory standard for '''[[compressed gas]]'''
# Is a gas or mixture of gases in a container having an absolute pressure exceeding 40 pounds per square inch (psi) at 70&amp;nbsp;°F (21.1&amp;nbsp;°C); or&lt;ref name="compressed gas streamline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asu.edu/uagc/EHS/power_point/compressed_gas_streamline.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206164546/http://www.asu.edu/uagc/EHS/power_point/compressed_gas_streamline.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Is a gas or mixture of gases having an absolute pressure exceeding 104 psi at 130&amp;nbsp;°F (54.4&amp;nbsp;°C) regardless of the pressure at 70&amp;nbsp;°F (21.1&amp;nbsp;°C); or&lt;ref name="compressed gas streamline" /&gt; 
# Is a liquid having a vapor pressure exceeding 40 psi at 100&amp;nbsp;°F (37.8&amp;nbsp;°C) as determined by ASTM ([[American Society for Testing and Materials]])

Within laboratories, compressed gases are usually supplied either through fixed piped gas systems or individual cylinders of gases. Compressed gases can be [[toxic]], [[flammable]], [[oxidizing]], [[corrosive]], or [[Inert gas|inert]]. Leakage of any of these gases can be hazardous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/compressed/compress.html#tphp | title=About Compressed gases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Store, handle, and use compressed gases ====
*All cylinders whether empty or full must be stored upright.&lt;ref name="compressed gases"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mathesongas.com/pdfs/products/guide-to-safe-handling-of-compressed-gases-publ-03.pdf | title=Store, handle, and use compressed gases}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Secure cylinders of compressed gases. Cylinders should never be dropped or allowed to strike each other with force.&lt;ref name="compressed gases" /&gt;
*Transport compressed gas cylinders with protective caps in place and do not roll or drag the cylinders.&lt;ref name="compressed gases" /&gt;

=== Cryogens and dry ice ===
'''Cryogens''', substances used to produce very low temperatures [below -153&amp;nbsp;°C (-243&amp;nbsp;°F)], such as [[liquid nitrogen]] (LN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which has a boiling point of -196&amp;nbsp;°C (-321&amp;nbsp;°F), are commonly used in laboratories.&lt;ref name="C &amp; DI"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.drs.illinois.edu/SafetyLibrary/CryogensAndDryIce| title=Safety Library Cryogens And DryIce | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not a cryogen, solid [[carbon dioxide]] or [[dry ice]] which converts directly to carbon dioxide gas at -78&amp;nbsp;°C (-109&amp;nbsp;°F) is also often used in laboratories. Shipments packed with dry ice, samples preserved with liquid [[nitrogen]], and in some cases, techniques that use cryogenic liquids, such as cryogenic grinding of samples, present potential hazards in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="C &amp; DI" /&gt;

Hand protection is required to guard against the hazard of touching cold surfaces. It is recommended that Cryogen Safety Gloves be used by the worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.airproducts.com/company/Sustainability/environment-health-and-safety/product-safety-safetygrams.aspx|title = Safetygrams|website = www.airproducts.com|access-date = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-group.slac.stanford.edu/esh/eshmanual/pdfs/ESHch36.pdf | title=Stanford University: SLAC Environment, Safety, and Health Manual, Chapter 36 | publisher=Stanford University | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eye]] protection is required at all times when working with cryogenic fluids. When pouring a cryogen, working with a wide-mouth Dewar flask or around the exhaust of cold boil-off gas, use of a full face shield is recommended.&lt;ref name="ES&amp;H Manual"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lbl.gov/ehs/pub3000/CH29/CH29.html | title=ES&amp;H Manual, Chapter 29: Safe Handling of cryogenic liquids | publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal protective equipments ===
{{main|Personal protective equipment}}'''Personal protective equipment''' or PPE are equipments worn to prevent against exposure of hazardous substances.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)|url = http://www.hse.gov.uk/toolbox/ppe.htm|website = www.hse.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, PPE does not eliminate the risks of hazards but it helps protect the user from the exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Laboratory Safety PPE {{!}} Yale Environmental Health and Safety|url = http://ehs.yale.edu/laboratory-safety-ppe|website = ehs.yale.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make a workplace safer, it should provide instructions and training of how to use and choose proper PPE in different situations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Protective nitrile gloves.jpg|thumb|158x158px|Nitrile gloves]]

PPE includes: 
* Long-sleeved shirts, [[lab coat]]s, aprons.&lt;ref name="ES&amp;H Manual" /&gt;
* [[goggle]]s&lt;ref name="ES&amp;H Manual" /&gt;
* Safety [[Medical glove|gloves]];&lt;ref name="ES&amp;H Manual" /&gt;
** There are 2 common types of safety gloves that are widely used in high school or university laboratory,  Latex and Nitrile gloves. Latex gloves have a high sensitivity when it comes to contact and fine control which is very suitable for surgery.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/01-12.pdf|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/01-12.pdf|website = www.nps.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hands, Nitrile gloves are the gloves that do not have latex protein which cost twice. It was known as the most durable, resisted to tear and many chemicals. Beside all the benefits, Nitrile gloves also have drawbacks since it can oxidize silver and high reactive metals as these metals can react with sulfur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, wearer should have an extra care while wearing this type of protective gloves.  
* Face shield or safety

=== Electrical ===
In the laboratory, there is the potential for workers to be exposed to electrical hazards including [[electric shock]], electrocutions, fires and [[explosions]]. Damaged electrical cords can lead to possible shocks or electrocutions. A flexible electrical cord may be damaged by door or window edges, by staples and fastenings, by equipment rolling over it, or simply by aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAquickfacts-lab-safety-electrical-hazards.pdf | title=Electrical Hazards | publisher=OSHA | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential for possible electrocution or electric shock or contact with electrical hazards can result from a number of factors, including the following:
*Faulty electrical equipment/instrumentation or wiring;&lt;ref name="Electrical"&gt;https://www.lanl.gov/safety/electrical/docs/elec_hazard_awareness_study_guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Damaged receptacles and connectors;&lt;ref name="Electrical" /&gt; and
*Unsafe work practices.&lt;ref name="Electrical" /&gt;

=== Fire ===
[[File:Segnale incendio.svg|thumb|Fire|154x154px]]
'''[[Fire]]''' is the most common serious hazard that one faces in a typical laboratory. While proper procedures and training can minimize the chances of an accidental fire, laboratory workers should still be prepared to deal with a fire emergency should it occur. In dealing with a laboratory fire, all containers of infectious materials should be placed into autoclaves, incubators, refrigerators, or freezers for containment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/programs-and-procedures/hazard-recognition-control/fire-hazards | title=Fire Hazards control | accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small bench-top fires in laboratory spaces are not uncommon. Large laboratory fires are rare. However, the risk of severe injury or death is significant because fuel load and hazard levels in labs are typically very high. Laboratories, especially those using solvents in any quantity, have the potential for flash fires, explosion, rapid spread of fire, and high toxicity of products of combustion (heat, smoke, and flame)
[[File:Fire blanket.jpeg|thumb|215x215px|Fire blanket]]

===Glassware===
* Broken glass is a hazard for a sharps related injury.
* Correct eye protection should be worn in most experiments involving glassware.
* Inserting a glass rod through a stopper can introduce the possibility of a stab wound or sharps injury if the rod breaks.  The hands must be protected.  
* Tubing should be cut from a barbed connection so as not to shatter the connection.  A quick disconnect is preferable to a barbed fitting.
* Ground glass joints can become a breaking hazard if they freeze.

* Broken and other waste glass should be discarded in a separate container specially marked to indicate its contents.
* Glassware should always be labeled as to its contents.
* Rapid heating (or cooling) may cause uneven [[thermal expansion]] putting too much [[Stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]] on the surface and cause it to [[fracture]]. Fracturing is a concern when people new to laboratory become impatient and heat glassware, especially the larger pieces, too fast. Heating of glassware should be slowed using an insulating material, such as metal foil or wool, or specialized equipment such as [[heated bath]]s, [[heating mantle]]s or laboratory grade [[hot plate]]s to avoid fracturing.
* Hot glass looks like cold glass, so a person must be careful to avoid grabbing hot glassware.
* Glassware can explode if the exhaust is in any way restricted, so any apparatus should be vented.  
* Glassware can implode under negative pressure
* When connecting joints, it is the responsibility of the person overseeing the experiment to select the correct seal. For example, PTFE tape, bands, and fluoroether-based grease or oils may emit toxic [[perfluoroisobutylene]] fumes if the rated temperature limits are exceed.&lt;ref&gt;Haiduc, I., "Silicone Grease: A Serendipitous Reagent for the Synthesis of Exotic Molecular and Supramolecular Compounds", Organometallics 2004, volume 23, pp. 3-8.  {{DOI|10.1021/om034176w}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Serendipitous Reactions Involving a Silicone Grease|author = Lucian C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38077">This is a '''list of nutrition guides'''. A nutrition guide is a [[reference]] that provides [[nutrition]] advice for general [[health]], typically by dividing foods into [[food group]]s and recommending [[serving size|servings]] of each group. Nutrition guides can be presented in written or visual form, and are commonly published by [[government agency|government agencies]], [[health association]]s and [[university]] health [[academic department|departments]].

Most countries also have [[nutrition facts label]]s which are not listed here; many of those reference specific target amounts for various nutrients.

==Historical guides==

===Ancient Greece===
The [[Hippocratic Corpus]] of [[Ancient Greece]] contains one of the earliest known nutrition guides. It recommends a [[season]]al [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. For [[winter]], it advises eating a heavy diet of bread and roasted meat and fish, while avoiding vegetables and restricting liquids to, if anything, strong wine. It then recommends a lighter [[summer]] diet of soft [[barley]] cake, vegetables, boiled meat, and large quantities of diluted wine. Gradual transitions between these two diets are advised in the intervening months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hippocratic Writings|year=1983|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-044451-3|pages=272–273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KKjpaVEpP9oC|author=Various|editor1=G. E. R. Lloyd |editor2=J. Chadwick |editor3=W. N. Mann |accessdate=6 June 2011|chapter=A Regimen for Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial China===
During the [[Tang Dynasty]], [[China|Chinese]] [[physician]] [[Sun Simiao]] is believed to have written the first nutrition guide in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. In his book, ''Precious Prescriptions for Emergencies'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:備|備]][[wikt:急|急]][[wikt:千|千]][[wikt:金|金]][[wikt:要|要]][[wikt:方|方]]|p=Beiji qianjin yaofang}}), the chapter "Dietary Treatment" ({{zh|c=[[wikt:食|食]][[wikt:治|治]]|p=Shiji}}) contains sections describing the effects of eating fruits, vegetables, grains and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsu|first=Elisabeth|title=Innovation in Chinese Medicine|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-80068-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BbYYstLfSyUC|accessdate=6 June 2011|chapter=Dietetics in Tang China and the first extant works of ''materia diatetica''|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First food pyramid===
Amid high food prices in 1972, [[Sweden]]'s [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] developed the idea of "basic foods" that were both cheap and [[nutritious]], and "supplemental foods" that added nutrition missing from the basic foods. [[Kooperativa Förbundet|KF]], a [[cooperative federation|consumer co-op]] that worked with the Board, sought to illustrate these food groups. KF developed a [[food guide pyramid|food pyramid]] because it could depict basic foods as its base, and introduced the guide to the public in 1974 in their magazine, ''[[:sv:Vi (tidning)|Vi]]''. At the base were bread, cereals, potatoes, milk, cheese and margarine; above it was a large section of supplemental [[vegetables]] and [[fruit]]; and at the top was an apex of supplemental meat, fish and eggs. The pyramid competed with the National Board's "dietary circle," which KF saw as problematic for resembling a cake divided into seven slices, and for not indicating how much of each food should be eaten. While the Board distanced itself from the pyramid, KF continued to promote it, and food pyramids were developed in other [[Scandinavia]]n countries, plus [[West Germany]], [[Japan]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The United States later developed its first food pyramid in 1992.&lt;ref name=KFPyramid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mersmak.kf.se/Toppmeny-startsida-/KFBibliotek/Kooperativ-kronika-startsida/Sok/KF-Kronika---Visa-artikel/?articleid=641 |title=Ett provkok blev provkök |language=Swedish |date=2008-10-03 |work=KF |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325031502/http://www.mersmak.kf.se/Toppmeny-startsida-/KFBibliotek/Kooperativ-kronika-startsida/Sok/KF-Kronika---Visa-artikel/?articleid=641 |archivedate=2012-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coop.se/Globala-sidor/OmKF/Kooperativ-samverkan/Var-historia1/Tidslinjen/1960-19901/1973/KF-Provkok-lanserar-iden-om-basmat/ |title=KF Provkök lanserar idén om basmat |language=Swedish |year=1973 |work=Coop |publisher=KF |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929023533/http://www.coop.se/Globala-sidor/OmKF/Kooperativ-samverkan/Var-historia1/Tidslinjen/1960-19901/1973/KF-Provkok-lanserar-iden-om-basmat/ |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=matpyramid|url=http://www.ne.se/matpyramid|work=Nationalencyklopedin|accessdate=7 June 2011|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government guides==

===Australia===
The [[Australia]]n [[Department of Health and Ageing]] publishes '''''The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating''''', which features a wheel divided into five sections: approximately 40 percent bread, cereals, rice, pasta and noodles; 30 percent vegetables and legumes; 10 percent fruit; 10 percent milk, yogurt and cheese; and 10 percent lean meat, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts and legumes. Below the wheel are reminders to drink plenty of water and eat fats and sweets occasionally or in small amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating – Enjoy a Variety of Foods Every Day|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm|work=Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing|accessdate=3 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319033600/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm|archivedate=19 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender, life stage and activity level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating: Background information for consumers|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/E384CFA588B74377CA256F190004059B/$File/fd-cons.pdf|work=Australian Department of Health and Ageing|accessdate=6 June 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
The [[Austria]]n Federal Ministry of Health uses '''The Austrian Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-de|Die Österreichische Ernährungspyramide}}), which is divided into 25 blocks, each block representing a daily serving from a food group. Starting at the base, there are six servings of non-alcoholic beverages (preferably low-energy drinks like water, tea, unsweetened fruit juice and vegetable juice); three servings of vegetables and legumes; two of fruit; four of cereals, bread, pasta, rice and potatoes (preferably whole grains); three of milk and dairy (two "white," like milk, yogurt or cream cheese, and one of yellow cheese); one of fats and oil (preferably olive or canola oil); three of meat, fish, sausage and eggs (preferably fish or lean meat); and three of fatty, sweet and salty foods (though not nutritionally recommended and to be consumed rarely).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Österreichische Ernährungspyramide|url=http://www.bmg.gv.at/home/Schwerpunkte/Ernaehrung/Empfehlungen/DIE_OeSTERREICHISCHE_ERNAeHRUNGSPYRAMIDE|work=Bundesministerium für Gesundheit|accessdate=12 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
The Voedingsdriehoek is a (mostly in Flanders) widely used tool for dietitians, health educators, schools, etc. to explain a balanced diet.
The triangle is constructed as a pyramid with five different layers. The bottom layer is the largest in area, so the most important, the top is narrow and there represents little food, although it is an essential ingredient. The layers are (from top to bottom):
-	Oil / fats
-	Protein: meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, meat substitutes
-	Fruits and vegetables
-	Starch or carbohydrates (bread, potatoes, rice, pasta, etc.)
-	Drinks
In 2005 a (rather symbolically) layer was added at the bottom: sports and exercise. This is not a food, but an important part of a healthy diet and lifestyle. The information services use the "active" food pyramid.

===Brazil===
[[Brazil]]'s [[Ministry of Health (Brazil)|Ministry of Health]] publishes the '''''Food Guide''''' ({{lang-pt|Guia Alimentar}}), which features a map of Brazil depicting each of [[Regions of Brazil|Brazil's five regions]] as puzzle pieces representing a food group. However, Brazil's food recommendations differ from the map, and feature eight food groups: rice, bread, pasta, potato and cassavas (5 servings a day); vegetables and legumes (3 servings); fruits (3); milk, cheese and yogurt (3); beans (1); meat, fish and eggs (1); oils and fats (1); and sugars and sweets (no more than one).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guia Alimentar|url=http://dab.saude.gov.br/portaldab/biblioteca.php?conteudo=publicacoes/guia_alimentar2014|work=Ministério da Saúde|language=Portuguese|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{main|Canada's Food Guide}}
'''''[[Canada's Food Guide]]''''' from [[Health Canada]] is illustrated with a [[rainbow]] of four food groups: vegetables and fruit (7 to 10 servings a day for adults, depending on biological sex), grain products (6 to 8), milk and alternatives (2), and meat and alternatives (2 to 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/index-eng.php|work=Health Canada|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender and life stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide – A Resource for Educators and Communicators|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/pubs/res-educat/res-educat-eng.php|work=Health Canada|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada developed its first nutrition guide in 1942 as part of its [[World War II|wartime]] nutrition program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada's Food Guides from 1942 to 1992|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/context/fg_history-histoire_ga-eng.php|work=Health Canada|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[China]]'s [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Health]] uses the '''Balanced Diet [[Pagoda]]''' ({{zh|[[wikt:平|平]][[wikt:衡|衡]][[wikt:膳|膳]][[wikt:食|食]][[wikt:宝|宝]][[wikt:塔|塔]]}}), which is divided into five [[storey|stories]] ascending from largest to smallest. Cereals are at the large base; topped by vegetables and fruits; then fish, poultry, meat, eggs and other animal foods; followed by milk and soy foods; and topped with fats and oils in the small [[spire]]. Beside the pagoda are images representing water and exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Health issued "China's Dietary Guidelines (2007)"|url=http://www.gov.cn/xwfb/2008-01/15/content_858517.htm|work=The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents|url=http://www.lxzfda.gov.cn/news_view.asp?news_id=126869|work=LinXia Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324232342/http://www.lxzfda.gov.cn/news_view.asp?news_id=126869|archivedate=24 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition Dietary Pagoda|url=http://www.scmiyi.gov.cn/smpd/shjk/ysbd/12990.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805193525/http://www.scmiyi.gov.cn/smpd/shjk/ysbd/12990.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 August 2012|work=Public information network of MIYI county|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
[[Denmark]]'s Food Administration uses the '''Diet Compass''' ({{lang-da|Kostkompasset}}) to depict its "Dietary 8" ({{lang-da|8 kostråd}}) guidelines, with an image on each compass point representing a guideline. Those guidelines are: "Eat 6 fruits and vegetables a day," "Eat fish and seafood several times a week," "Eat potatoes, rice or pasta and whole wheat bread every day," "Cut back on sugar," "Cut back on greasy foods," "Eat a varied diet and maintain a normal weight," "Quench your thirst with water," and, "Be physically active at least 30 minutes a day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kostkompasset|url=http://www.altomkost.dk/Services/Materialer_og_undervisning/Kostkompasset/forside.htm|work=Fødevarestyrelsen|accessdate=12 June 2011|language=Danish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903205510/http://www.altomkost.dk/Services/Materialer_og_undervisning/Kostkompasset/forside.htm|archivedate=3 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[France]]'s [[:fr:Institut national de prévention et d'éducation pour la santé|National Institute for Prevention and Health Education]] has 25 separate food guides under the title '''The Food Guide For All''' ({{lang-fr|Le Guide Alimentaire Pour Tous}}). Each guide is based on a consumer's personality, habits and lifestyle. There are guides for people who: are health-conscious, don't care about food, prepare family meals, are poor, eat at restaurants, skip meals, don't cook, have large appetites, are on diets, prefer certain foods, avoid various foods (including meat), are sedentary, are athletic, and more. Each guide features a "portrait" in the image of a happy face designed out of foods representing that consumer's type. The portraits are billed as nutrition recommendations, though they are more decorative than informative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le guide alimentaire pour tous|url=http://www.inpes.sante.fr/espace_nutrition/guide/presentation/mode.asp|work=Institut national de prévention et d'éducation pour la santé|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
[[Germany]]'s state-funded [[:de:Aid infodienst|Aid Information Service]] uses the '''Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-de|Ernährungspyramide}}), which divides a pyramid into 22 blocks, each block representing a hand-sized serving from a food group. Starting at the base, there are six blocks for beverages, three for vegetables, two for fruit, four for grains, three for dairy, one for meat and fish, one for oils, one for fats, and one for sweets and alcohol. Beverages, vegetables, fruit and grains are marked green for "free travel"; meat and dairy are marked yellow for "caution"; and oils, fats, sweets and alcohol are marked red for "brake lights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die aid-Ernährungspyramide|url=http://www.was-wir-essen.de/gesund/empfehlungen_aid_pyramide.php|work=was-wir-essen|publisher=aid infodienst|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aid also collaborated with the German Nutrition Society to create a [[three-dimensional space|3D]] pyramid model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die dreidimensionale Lebensmittelpyramide|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=481|work=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
[[India]]'s [[National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad|National Institute of Nutrition]] publishes the '''''Dietary Guidelines for Indians''''', which, among other diagrams, includes the Food Pyramid. The pyramid has a base of beans and legumes to eat adequately, a second layer of vegetables and fruit to eat liberally, a third layer of meat, fish, eggs and oils to eat moderately, and an apex of fatty, salty and sugary foods to eat sparingly. Accompanying the pyramid is a recommendation of regular exercise and physical activity, as well as warnings against drinking alcohol and smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Guidelines for Indians|url=http://www.ninindia.org/DietaryguidelinesforIndians-Finaldraft.pdf|work=National Institute of Nutrition|accessdate=12 June 2011|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516002639/http://www.ninindia.org/DietaryguidelinesforIndians-Finaldraft.pdf|archivedate=16 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The island of [[Ireland]]'s [[Food Safety Promotion Board]] uses '''The Food Pyramid''', which is divided into five levels: bread, cereals and potatoes at the large base (6 or more servings); then fruit and vegetables (5); followed by milk, cheese and yogurt (3); then meat, fish, eggs and alternatives (2); and finally fats, high fat/sugar snacks, foods and drinks at the apex (small amounts). At least 8 cups of water a day are also recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Food Pyramid|url=http://www.safefood.eu/en/Consumer/Healthy-Living/Eating-Well/Eating-well1/The-food-pyramid/|work=safefood|publisher=The Food Safety Promotion Board|accessdate=6 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712035747/http://www.safefood.eu/en/Consumer/Healthy-Living/Eating-Well/Eating-well1/The-food-pyramid/|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
The '''Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-he|[[:he:פירמידת המזון|פירמידת המזון]]}}) from [[Israel]]'s [[Ministry of Health (Israel)|Ministry of Health]] is divided into six levels. At the wide base is water; followed by starches, including pasta, bread, corn and yams; then fruits and vegetables; then meat, fish, eggs and dairy; then fats and oils; and finally sugary foods at the small apex. Images around the pyramid represent exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Pyramid|url=http://www.health.gov.il/pages/default.asp?maincat=33&amp;catid=846|work=Ministry of Health|accessdate=6 June 2011|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The [[Italy|Italian]] [[Ministry of Health (Italy)|Ministry of Health]] uses the '''Italian Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-it|Piramide Alimentare Italiana}}), which is divided into squares, triangles, [[trapezoid]]s and rectangles that represent one, one-half, one-and-a-half, and two servings, respectively. Beginning from the base, the divisions are: fruit (2 servings), water (1), vegetables (2), bread (1.5), biscotti (0.5), potatoes (0.5), rice and pasta (1.5), meat (1), eggs (0.5), fish (0.5), legumes (0.5), [[cold cut]] meats (0.5), milk (0.5), dairy (0.5), oils and fats (1), sweets (0.5) and wine or beer (0.5). Along the edges of the pyramid are triangles representing physical activity. The pyramid is intended to represent the variety of foods eaten over an entire week, averaged into daily portions. Also provided is an alternative, more traditional pyramid for a single day, divided into six layers representing six food groups; as well as two additional pyramids for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piramide Alimentare Italiana|url=http://www.piramidealimentare.it/|work=Istituto di Scienza dell'Alimentazione|publisher=Università di Roma|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The '''Food Guide''' ({{lang-ja|食事バランスガイド}}), from [[Japan]]'s [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Health]] and [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Agriculture]] ministries, is depicted as a [[top|spinning top]] with a wide upper layer tapering to a narrow bottom. At the large upper level is a [[staple food|staple meal]] of carbohydrates, including rice, bread and noodles (5 to 7 servings a day); followed below by a [[side dish]] of vegetables, potatoes, beans (except soybeans), mushrooms and seaweed (5 to 6); then a smaller [[main course]] of protein, including meat, fish, eggs and soy (3 to 5); and finally the narrow point, divided between dairy (2) and fruit (2). The top's handle is filled with "essential" water and tea, and running in circles around the handle is a figure representing moderate exercise. A small [[motion lines|motion line]] beside the top represents sweet beverages in moderation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Guide|url=http://www.maff.go.jp/j/balance_guide/|work=Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
[[Mexico]]'s Department of Nutrition and Health Promotion uses '''The Plate of Good Eating''' ({{lang-es|El Plato del Bien Comer}}), which is divided into thirds: vegetables and fruits (in equal proportion); cereals; and legumes and animal products. The guide further recommends eating "many" vegetables and fruits and "enough" cereals. The legume and animal products section is subdivided, and "few" animal products are recommended, while the guide recommends combining the larger legume section with cereals. Additional recommendations are to include each of the three food groups in each of the three main meals of the day, to eat the greatest possible variety of food, to eat according to individual needs and conditions, and to eat the least possible fats, oils, sugar and salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Plato del Bien Comer|url=http://www.fns.org.mx/index.php?IdContenido=46|work=Fomento de Nutrición y Salud|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The [[Netherlands]] Nutrition Center uses the '''Wheel of Five''' ({{lang-nl|[[:nl:Schijf van vijf|De Schijf van Vijf]]}}), which is divided into five groups: approximately 30 percent vegetables and fruit; 30 percent bread, cereals, potatoes, rice, pasta, couscous, and legumes; 16 percent dairy, meat, fish, eggs and meat substitutes; 16 percent beverages; and 8 percent fats and oils. More specific recommendations are provided based on age and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De Schijf van Vijf|url=http://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/schijf-van-vijf/schijf.aspx|work=Het Voedingscentrum|accessdate=4 June 2011|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
[[South Korea]]'s Korean Nutrition Society uses the '''Food Bicycle''' ({{lang-ko|식품구성 자전거}}), with a small front wheel filled with water and a large rear wheel composed of approximately one-third grains; 20 percent meat, fish, eggs and beans; 20 percent vegetables; 12 percent fruits; 12 percent dairy; and 3 percent oils and sugars. A person is pedaling the bicycle, representing exercise. More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender and life stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Koreans 2010|url=http://image.campushomepage.com/users/knsweb/ssugi513/DRIs/2010KDRIs_open_final.pdf|work=The Korean Nutrition Society|accessdate=6 June 2011|language=Korean|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2010, South Korea used a [[:ko:파일:Korean food pyramid.jpg|food pagoda model]] very similar to China's current guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of dietary reference intake publilcations|url=http://www.kns.or.kr/board.asp?catalogid=kns2008&amp;language=en&amp;boardcode=sub07_01|work=The Korean Nutrition Society|accessdate=4 June 2011|location=Select first item dated 2007.04.11 (direct link does not work)|language=English, Korean|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235113/http://www.kns.or.kr/board.asp?catalogid=kns2008&amp;language=en&amp;boardcode=sub07_01|archivedate=24 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
[[Spain]]'s Ministry of Health, Social Policy and Equality uses the '''NAOS Pyramid''' ({{lang-es|Pirámide NAOS}}), which promotes a [[Mediterranean diet]] as well as plenty of physical activity, and is drawn as a sailboat on water. It is divided into beverages and water at the base; an equal division between physical activity and a combination of grains, vegetables, tubers, fruit, olive oil and dairy in the second level, which is labeled "several times a day" and color-coded green; an equal division between sports and a combination of meat, fish, eggs, legumes and nuts in the third level, which is labeled "several times a week" and is color-coded orange; and an apex of saturated fats, sugars, salt, and sedentary activity labeled "occasionally" and color-coded red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pirámide NAOS|url=http://www.naos.aesan.mspsi.es/csym/piramide/|work=Ministerio de Sanidad, Política Social e Igualdad|publisher=Gobierno de España|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301064250/http://www.naos.aesan.mspsi.es/csym/piramide/|archivedate=1 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
[[Sweden]]'s Food Agency uses the '''Plate Model''' ({{lang-sv|Tallriksmodellen}}), which divides a plate into approximately 40 percent potatoes, rice, pasta and bread; 40 percent vegetables and fruit; and 20 percent meat, fish, eggs and legumes. People requiring more energy are allowed a larger share of carbohydrates, while people who are overweight can make up to half their plate vegetables and fruit.&lt;ref name=LVPlate/&gt;

Previously, Sweden used the Dietary Circle created in 1963, while Swedish consumer cooperative KF created the world's first food pyramid in 1974.&lt;ref name=KFPyramid/&gt;

===Switzerland===
[[Switzerland]]'s Federal Office of Public Health uses the '''Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-de|Lebensmittelpyramide}}) developed by the Swiss Society for Nutrition. At the base is 1 to 2 liters of liquids, preferably non-sugared beverages; then three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit of different colors; followed by whole grains, beans, cereals and potatoes to be eaten with each meal; then three servings of milk or dairy; one serving of meat, fish, eggs, cheese or another protein; oils, fats and nuts daily in moderation; and an apex of sweet/salty snacks and sweetened/alcoholic drinks in moderation for pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendations for healthy, tasty eating and drinking for adults|url=http://www.sge-ssn.ch/fileadmin/pdf/100-ernaehrungsthemen/10-gesundes_essen_trinken/Food_Pyramid.pdf|work=Swiss Society for Nutrition|accessdate=12 June 2011|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102034630/http://www.sge-ssn.ch/fileadmin/pdf/100-ernaehrungsthemen/10-gesundes_essen_trinken/Food_Pyramid.pdf|archivedate=2 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lebensmittelpyramide|url=http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/ernaehrung_bewegung/05207/05214/index.html|work=Bundesamt für Gesundheit|accessdate=12 June 2011|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928200158/http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/ernaehrung_bewegung/05207/05214/index.html|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
[[Turkey]]'s [[Ministry of Health (Turkey)|Ministry of Health]] uses the '''Basic Food Groups''' ({{lang-tr|Temel Besin Grupları}}), a four-part division of milk and dairy; meat, eggs, fish, legumes and seeds; vegetables and fruit; and bread and cereal. Each food group is accompanied by bullet points, such as serving recommendations or advice to eat more raw vegetables and whole grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temel Besin Grupları|url=http://www.beslenme.saglik.gov.tr/index.php?pid=188|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014130125/http://www.beslenme.saglik.gov.tr/index.php?pid=188|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 October 2010|work=Sağlık Bakanlığı|accessdate=12 June 2011|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Eatwell plate|Dietary Reference Values}}
[[File:Eatwell Plate.png|thumb|The Eatwell plate, as described by the United Kingdom's NHS and FSA.]]
The [[United Kingdom]]'s Department of Health published Dietary Reference Values. These are equivalent to the easier to understand [[Eatwell plate]] used by the [[National Health Service]]. This consists of roughly one-third fruit and vegetables ("at least 5 portions"); one-third bread, rice, potatoes and pasta ("plenty"); a smaller amount of milk and dairy ("some"); meat, fish, eggs and beans in the same proportion as dairy ("some"); and a small wedge of fatty and sugary foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The eatwell plate|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/eatwell-plate.aspx|work=National Health Service|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:USDA MyPlate green.svg|thumb|[[MyPlate]], from the [[United States]] [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]]]]
{{main|MyPlate|History of USDA nutrition guides}}
In the [[United States]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] uses '''[[MyPlate]]''', a plate icon divided into approximately 30 percent grains, 30 percent vegetables, 20 percent fruits and 20 percent protein, accompanied by a smaller circle representing dairy. Additional recommendations include to enjoy food but eat less, avoid oversized portions, make at least half of grains [[whole grain|whole]], switch to fat-free or low-fat milk, choose foods with less sodium, and drink water instead of sugary drinks.

Previous USDA food guides include the [[History of USDA nutrition guides#Basic 7|Basic 7]] (1943–1956), the [[History of USDA nutrition guides#Basic Four|Basic Four]] (1956–1992), the [[Food Guide Pyramid]] (1992–2005), and [[MyPyramid]] (2005–2011).

The [[National Institutes of Health]] uses the Dietary Approaches to Stop [[Hypertension]] ('''DASH''') '''Eating Plan''' for people seeking to lower their [[blood pressure]]. DASH differs from MyPlate in that the protein category is replaced by a smaller proportion of lean meats, [[poultry]], and [[fish (food)|fish]]; there are separate sections for fats and [[vegetable fats and oils|oils]], legumes, and [[confectionery|sweets]]; and fruits and vegetables don't constitute half of the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthier Eating with DASH|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/hbp/prevent/h_eating/h_e_dash.htm|work=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=3 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716051126/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/hbp/prevent/h_eating/h_e_dash.htm|archivedate=16 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is the DASH Eating Plan?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/dash/dash_what.html|work=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion]] in the USDA and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] jointly release a longer textual document called ''[[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]]'', updated in 2015 with the next scheduled revision in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/dietaryguidelines.htm|title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dietary Reference Intake]] values are published by the [[Institute of Medicine]] for general use, but [[nutrition facts label]]s in the U.S. use the older [[Reference Daily Intake]] standards instead.

===World Health Organization===
The [[World Health Organization]] uses '''The 3 Fives''', a guide featuring five key points in each of three categories. The three categories are safer food, a healthy diet, and appropriate physical activity. In the healthy diet category, the five keys are: "Give your baby only breast milk for the first 6 months of life," "Eat a variety of food," "Eat plenty of vegetables and fruit," "Eat moderate amounts of fats and oil," and "Eat less salt and sugar." Each key includes bullet points with further recommendations. The 3 Fives was originally developed for distribution at major sporting events like the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] and the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], but it can also be used for general audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 3 Fives|url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/consumer/3_fives_Beijing/en/index.html|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=3 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609134315/http://www.who.int/foodsafety/consumer/3_fives_Beijing/en/index.html|archivedate=9 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before The 3 Fives, the WHO used the CINDI dietary guide, which included the CINDI pyramid. The guide was intended to help European health professionals and policymakers develop their own national nutrition guides. The pyramid has a large green base representing approximately two-thirds of the triangle's area, which is filled with vegetables, fruits, grains and starches. A middle layer shaded orange for "caution" is divided into two equal sections: low-fat milk and dairy; and beans, lentils, legumes, fish, eggs, poultry and lean meat. At the top is a small "red zone" of fats and sweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CINDI dietary guide|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/119926/E70041.pdf|work=WHO Regional Office for Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)===
FAO provides technical assistance to countries for developing, revising and implementing food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) and food guides in line with current scientific evidence. FAO also carries out periodic reviews on progress made in the development and use of dietary guidelines. FAO's food based dietary guidelines website collects more than 80 national guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food-based dietary guidelines|url=http://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-dietary-guidelines/home/en/|work=Food and Agriculture Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other guides==
*The [[American Diabetes Association]] uses the '''Create Your Plate''' system, which divides a plate into three sections: non-starchy vegetables (the largest section), starchy foods, and meat or meat substitutes. Like [[MyPlate]], the ADA complements its plate with a glass of low-fat or nonfat milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Create Your Plate|url=http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/planning-meals/create-your-plate/|work=American Diabetes Association|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Germany|German]] Nutrition Society ({{lang-de|[[:de:Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung]]}}) publishes the '''Food Circle''' ({{lang-de|Ernährungskreis}}), which is divided into 30 percent cereals and potatoes; 26 percent vegetables and salad; 17 percent fruit; 18 percent milk and dairy; 7 percent meat, sausage, fish and eggs; and 2 percent fats and oils. Beverages, represented by a glass of water, are placed in the interior of the circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eine runde Sache: Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=219|work=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=413|work=Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German|date=1 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Harvard School of Public Health]] uses the '''[[Healthy eating pyramid|Healthy Eating Pyramid]]''', which is split into nine sections, including a base of daily exercise and weight control. Compared to MyPlate, grains become whole grains, with refined grains in a "use sparingly" category; protein is split between "fish, poultry and [[egg (food)|eggs]]" and "[[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[Seed#Edible seeds|seeds]], [[bean]]s and [[tofu]]" with [[red meat]] and processed meat in a "use sparingly" category; healthy fats and oils have their own section; and dairy can be substituted with calcium and vitamin D [[dietary supplement|supplements]]. To the side of the pyramid are [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] in moderation and a daily [[multivitamin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Eating Pyramid|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/pyramid/|work=University of Michigan Health System|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Massachusetts]] Department of Health and Human Services uses the '''Plate Method''', which shows a plate that is one-half fruits and vegetables, one-quarter grains and starches, and one-quarter meat and protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use the Plate Method|url=http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eohhs2terminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Consumer&amp;L2=Prevention+and+Wellness&amp;L3=Healthy+Living&amp;L4=Eat+Better&amp;sid=Eeohhs2&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=dph_mass_in_motion_eat_better_plate_method&amp;csid=Eeohhs2|work=Massachusetts Health and Human Services|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Overall Nutritional Quality Index]]
*The [[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]] uses the '''Power Plate''', which promotes a [[vegan]] diet and is divided into equal parts fruit, grains, [[legume]]s and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Plate|url=http://www.pcrm.org/health/powerplate/|work=Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[University of Michigan]] Health System uses the '''Healing Foods Pyramid''', which consists of 11 sections, including a base of [[drinking water|water]]. Compared to MyPlate, it adds sections for legumes, [[seasoning]]s, healthy fats, and eggs. Lean meats are in a weekly category, as are fish and [[seafood]]. An optional category includes alcohol, [[tea]] and [[Types of chocolate#Classification|dark chocolate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healing Foods Pyramid 2010|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/food-pyramid|work=University of Michigan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605000847/http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/food-pyramid/|archivedate=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [LiveWell for LIFE] project uses '''National Plates''' to show the ideal composition of diets in various EU countries that are both healthy, environmentally sustainable and affordable. This concept was pioneered by WWF in the UK and is now  financially supported by the  European Commission under the LIFE Plus programme(see [[Sustainable diet]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LiveWell Plate|url=http://www.livewellforlife.eu/|work=LiveWell for LIFE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3044">The '''Lustgarten Foundation''', founded in 1999, is a [[501(c)3]] [[non-profit]] organization with the mission of advancing scientific and medical research related to the diagnosis, treatment, cure and prevention of [[pancreatic cancer]]. It is the largest private foundation dedicated solely to funding pancreatic cancer research. Based in [[Bethpage, NY]], The Lustgarten Foundation has the goal of: Increasing [[funding]] and support of [[research]] into the biological mechanisms and clinical strategies related to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of pancreatic cancer; Facilitating and enhancing the dialogue among members of the medical and [[scientific communities]] about basic and [[clinical research]] efforts that relate to pancreatic cancer; Heightening public awareness of pancreatic cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prevention and providing informational support for pancreatic cancer patients, their families, and friends.&lt;ref&gt;http://lustgarten.org/page.aspx?pid=623&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary method for advocacy and gathering donations involves runs/walks and other events at a regional level. The Lustgarten Foundation has raised more than $16.1 million for pancreatic cancer research as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kintera.org/site/c.ckLQKbOZLkK2E/b.7468185/k.BEBE/Home.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation fostered the collaborative effort known as the Pancreatic Cancer Research Consortium,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lustgarten.org/page.aspx?pid=965&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010, which comprises six leading medical institutions across the United States. Its members are the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]], [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] in affiliation with [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], The [[David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research]] at [[MIT]], [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], and [[The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center]].

'''Max Westenhöfer''' (February 9, 1871 – September 25, 1957) was a German [[pathologist]] and [[biologist]] who contributed to the development of the [[anatomic pathology]] and the reform of public health in [[Chile]].

==Education==
Maximilian Joseph Johann Westenhöfer&lt;ref name=bender&gt;[http://www.aquatic-hypothesis.com/ Mr and Mrs Bender]&lt;/ref&gt; was born on February 9, 1871 in [[Ansbach]], [[Bavaria]]. His father was a school teacher called Johan Karl Westenhöffer, but the son later simplified the spelling of his surname. His mother's maiden name was Knell,&lt;ref name=SW53&gt;Sievers Wicke (1958) page 53&lt;/ref&gt; and in later years her name was sometimes appended to his according to [[Spanish naming customs|the Spanish naming custom]]. making his name Max Westenhöfer Knell.&lt;ref name=MWK/&gt;

He studied at the [[University of Berlin]] where he graduated in 1894. He was a pupil of [[Rudolf Virchow]], German physician and Professor of Pathology at the University of Berlin, known also for his interest in [[public health]].&lt;ref name=MWK&gt;{{cite journal| journal=SAVALnet| title=Max Westenhöfer Knell: pionero de la anatomía patológica en Chile| date=October 2005| url=http://www.saval.cl/link.cgi/MundoMedico/Reportajes/6054| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222190912/http://www.saval.cl/link.cgi/MundoMedico/Reportajes/6054| archivedate=2009-12-22| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first employment was as an army doctor, which he remained, apart from three years in Chile, until 1922.&lt;ref name=SW54&gt;Sievers Wicke (1958) page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

== First tenure in Chile (1908–1911): Social medicine report and expulsion==
In 1908 he was hired by Augusto Matte, on behalf of the government of [[Chile]], to teach [[Pathology]] at the School of Medicine of the [[University of Chile]]. As an international expert with the role to reform and modernize the teaching of pathology in Chile, the Chilean government provided him a higher salary than the local medical colleagues which motivated envy and resentment among some Chilean physicians.&lt;ref name=uchile&gt;[http://www.revistas.uchile.cl/index.php/ANUC/article/viewFile/10921/11177/.PDF Revistas Universidad de Chile (In Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 he published what has been called the ''Westenhöfer Report'', a five article series published in the German medical journal ''Berliner klinische Wochenschrift'' where he described in critical terms the poor health conditions and hygiene practices that he observed in certain urban areas and nursing homes in Santiago of Chile.  His report led to protests from the conservative sector of the Chilean society which eventually led the government to deport him from Chile.  However, the [[University of Chile Student Federation]] (FECH) including his medical students, some unions, and leftist parties gave public support to Prof. Westenhöffer and protested at his expulsion.  In August 1911 there was a massive march in Santiago of Chile to protest at his expulsion and make a judicial appeal to prevent it, which did not take place until after he had left.&lt;ref name=uchile/&gt;

==Return to Germany (1911–1929): Professor of pathology at the University of Berlin ==
Following his departure in 1911 he returned to Germany and resumed his career with the army. During [[World War I]], he served as a military surgeon with the rank of major (''Oberstabsarzt'')&lt;ref name=soldbuch&gt;[http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/1932 WW1 pay-book]&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded the [[Iron Cross]], second class.&lt;ref name=EK&gt;[http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/1930 Iron Cross award]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 he became Professor of Pathology at the University of Berlin.&lt;ref name=precarious&gt;[http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P356.PDF Precarious Matters:The History of Dangerous and Endangered Substances in the 19th and 20th Centuries]&lt;/ref&gt;
At this time he was also deputy chairman of the Berlin ''Gesellschaft für Rassenhygiene'' ([[German Society for Racial Hygiene]]).&lt;ref name=GfR&gt;{{cite book| title= The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics 1927-1945: Crossing Boundaries| first=Hans-Walter |last=Schmuhl| publisher=Springer |year=2008 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LeQusx57mpkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=Westenh%C3%B6fer+eugenics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HP4lk1JASK&amp;sig=z5F7rfT6ziLeY-VcETp-usBVovs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=whxrUM7NBYOn0QWTpYH4AQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Westenh%C3%B6fer%20eugenics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second tenure in Chile (1929–1932): Reform of Chilean pathology==
He returned to Chile in 1929 and for three years directed the Department of Pathology at the Medical School of the University of Chile. This was his most fruitful period in furthering the development and the quality of Chilean medicine. He modernised the practice of pathology and trained Chilean colleagues. Pathology institutes were founded in the hospitals in Santiago and Valparaiso.&lt;ref name=MWK/&gt; His stress on the social determinants of mortality and morbidity influenced a generation of students, including [[Salvador Allende]], a medical student activist and later President of Chile.&lt;ref name=Allende&gt;{{cite journal| journal = International Journal of Epidemiology| volume=34 | issue=4| pages=739–741| first=Howard |last=Waitzkin| title= Commentary: Salvador Allende and the birth of Latin American social medicine | url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/4/739.full | doi=10.1093/ije/dyh176 | pmid=15860637}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PLOS&gt;{{cite journal| journal= PLOS Medicine | title= How Did Social Medicine Evolve, and Where Is It Heading?|date=October 2006| first=Dorothy| last=Porter| doi= 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030399 | url= http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030399#s1| pmid=17076552| pmc=1621092| volume=3| pages=e399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Chile, after studying the data on the occurrence of [[syphilis]] he contributed to the still ongoing controversy about the origin of this disease. Westenhöfer observed little effect of the disease in Indian carriers and the terrible effects experienced by those of European origin who were infected, which led him to state that a corresponding [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] existed in America before the [[European colonization of the Americas|European conquest]].

==Back to Germany (1932–1948): Publication of the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis==
{{further|Aquatic Ape Hypothesis}}

He returned again to [[Germany]] where he spent the [[World War II|war]] years, living latterly in retirement in [[Wasserburg am Bodensee]].&lt;ref name=SW93&gt;Sievers Wicke (1958) page 93&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1923 onwards&lt;ref name=bipedia&gt;[http://cerbi.ldi5.com/article.php3?id_article=33 Centre d’Etude et de Recherche sur la Bipédie Initiale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419140634/http://cerbi.ldi5.com/article.php3?id_article=33 |date=2013-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote several books and papers on [[human evolution]], perhaps most fully in his 1942  book "Der Eigenweg des Menschen" (translated as "The Path Travelled by Man Alone" or "The Unique Road to Man")&lt;ref name=eigenweg&gt;[http://www.riverapes.com/AAH/Westnfr/WestnHfr.htm title page of Der Eigenweg and some translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515104330/http://www.riverapes.com/AAH/Westnfr/WestnHfr.htm |date=2013-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which put forward ideas suggesting, amongst other things, that adaptation to water has played a significant part in the history of human development. That particular idea has since been developed as the controversial [[Aquatic ape hypothesis]] (AAH), but the details of Westenhöfer's theory, such as that bipedalism is primitive in mammals,&lt;ref name=bipedia/&gt; are not shared by most modern supporters of the AAH.&lt;ref name=bender/&gt;

==Final tenure in Chile (1948–1957)==
In 1948, at the age of 77 he returned once more to Chile under a contract with the Junta Central de Beneficencia (Central Board of Charities) to serve as a pathology adviser.&lt;ref name=SW72&gt;Sievers Wicke (1958) page 72&lt;/ref&gt; For his long record of contributions in Chile he was decorated by the government with the [[Order of Bernardo O'Higgins]].&lt;ref name=MWK/&gt;  His legacy on the teaching of the anatomic pathology in Chile was continued by his students, especially Dr Ismael Mena at the [[University of Chile]] and Dr Roberto Barahona Silva, founder of the Department of Pathology at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]].&lt;ref name=uchile/&gt;

==Personal life==
Westenhöfer was married twice. From the first marriage, to Anna Maria,&lt;ref name=AnnaMaria&gt;[http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/1907#prettyPhoto Anna Maria Westenhöfer in 1915]&lt;/ref&gt; he had three children, Grete, who was born in Chile, and Rudolf who was educated at the German School of Santiago. Only Wolf survived the war and lived in Berlin with six children. His second marriage was to Jutta, née Windmŭller,&lt;ref name=SW52&gt;Sievers Wicke (1958) page 52&lt;/ref&gt; who survived him.&lt;ref name="SW72"/&gt;

He died on September 25, 1957 in [[Santiago de Chile]],&lt;ref name=SW47&gt;Sievers Wicke (1958) page 47&lt;/ref&gt; which he considered his second home. Dr. Westenhöfer was buried in the [[Cementerio General de Santiago]].

The '''Muisca cuisine''' describes the food and preparation the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] elaborated. The Muisca were an advanced civilization inhabiting the central highlands of the [[Colombia]]n [[Andes]] ([[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]) before the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]] in the 1530s. Their diet and cuisine consisted of many endemic flora and fauna of Colombia. Main product of the Muisca was [[maize]], in various forms. The advantage of maize was that it could be grown in the various climatic zones the Muisca territories experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Restrepo, 2009, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; It was the basis for their diet and the alcoholic drink, [[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]], made from fermented maize and sugar. In the [[Muisca religion]] their agriculture and celebration of harvests, conducted along the complex [[Muisca calendar]], were protected by [[Chaquén]] and [[Nencatacoa]]. The Muisca ate a variety of roots and tubers and even had a specific word in their [[Chibcha language]] for eating those: ''bgysqua''.&lt;ref&gt;García, 2012, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corncobs.jpg|thumb|right|235px|'''''Aba'''''; maize, the main product for the Muisca]]
The Muisca cultivated many different crops in their own regions, part of the [[Muisca Confederation]], and obtained more exotic culinary treats through trade with neighbouring [[indigenous peoples of Colombia|indigenous peoples]], with as most important; the [[Lache people|Lache]] (cotton, tobacco, tropical fruits, sea snails), [[Muzo people|Muzo]] (emeralds, Magdalena River fish, access to gold, spices), [[Achagua people|Achagua]] (coca, feathers, yopó, Llanos Basin fish, curare). The climatic variation of the Muisca territories allowed for the [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]] of different crops. [[Javier Ocampo López]] describes the Muisca diet as predominantly vegetarian: [[potato]]es, [[maize]], [[bean]]s, [[mandioca]], [[tomato]]es, [[calabaza]]s, [[Capsicum|peppers]] and numerous fruits. The Muisca also used grains known today as [[quinoa]]. Main base for the Muisca cuisine was maize, considered a holy crop. The Muisca roasted [[corn]] (maize), ate it off the plant or converted it into [[popcorn]]. Main meat was the [[guinea pig]], [[endemic]] to [[South America]], which they farmed in their homes. In special cases they ate [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, [[white-tailed deer|deer]], [[capybara]] (''chigüiro'' in Spanish), and fish from the rivers and lakes of the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] and Magdalena and Llanos through trade. The Muisca drank a lot of [[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]], a fermented alcoholic drink of maize and sugar, served in [[ceramic]] pots called ''urdu'' or ''aryballus''.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleodietary studies performed on the [[Bogotá savanna]], where 18 Muisca skeletons ranging in historical age from 8th to 10th century AD and 26 skeletons from the 12th and 13th century AD, together with analysis of 10 [[Muisca mummification|mummies]] of the [[Guane people|Guane]], [[Lache people|Lache]] and Muisca were analysed, have shown that about 60% of the food of the people consisted of vegetary products and 40% of meat and especially fish.

After the Spanish conquest, the access to meat was drastically reduced changing the diet of the Muisca and other indigenous groups of central Colombia. Studies from [[Tunja]], called Hunza in the time of the Muisca, have shown the people did not suffer from malnutrition though.&lt;ref name=Martinez_p100&gt;Martínez &amp; Manrique, 2014, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Words for maize ===
[[File:Mais kiemplant eerste blad.jpg|right|thumb|235px|'''''Fica'''''; maize leaf]]
[[File:Jf8678Maize kernels Lubaofvf 08.JPG|thumb|right|235px|'''''Agua'''''; maize kernels]]
[[File:Maizmorado.png|right|235px|thumb|'''''Chiscami'''''; black maize]]
As maize was the most important crop and food for the Muisca, their language ([[Chibcha language|Muysccubun]]) had many different words for maize, parts of the plant and the different processes and eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;Daza, 2013, pp.27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

''Note: for the pronunciation, it helps to think Spanish; "j" refers to hard English "h"-sound, not the soft English "j/y"''

{{main|Muisca agriculture}}
The Muisca cultivated their crops in so-called ''camellones'', artificially elevated surfaces that allowed the roots of the crops to be sufficiently irrigated with the -on average 700-1000 mm of- rain in a year and drainage systems regulating the water levels.&lt;ref&gt;García, 2012, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4225">The '''National Medicinal Drugs Policy''' is an essential part of [[Sri Lanka]]'s [[Health Policy]], aimed at the rational use of [[pharmaceuticals]].

By the beginning of the 21st Century, Sri Lanka had approximately 9,000 registered medicinal drugs,  hundreds of which were non-essential, unnecessary, highly expensive or even dangerous. In 1996 the Government of President [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]] had established a new health policy, one stated aim of which was to develop and implement a National Drug Policy for the [[National pharmaceuticals policy|rational use and distribution of drugs]]. While this policy continues to this day, no concrete measures had been adopted for its implementation.

In 2005 the [[United People's Freedom Alliance]] Government promised to establish a National Medicinal Drugs Policy (NMPD) that would enable Sri Lankans significantly to cut down on drug expenses and get quality drugs at affordable prices while saving billions of [[Rupee]]s in foreign exchange for the country. It anticipated that the implementation of the NMDP could reduce the number of drugs imported, prescribed and sold in Sri Lanka to about 350 varieties.

Consultations were held with all stakeholders, presided over by Prof. [[Krisantha Weerasuriya]], the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Regional Advisor, Essential Medicines over four days in June 2005, and the draft for the NMDP was prepared. In October, the Minister of Health obtained cabinet approval for the draft NMDP and promised that the appropriate legislation would be introduced in parliament.

In February 2006 the Health Ministry called another meeting of all stakeholders and the Minister gave assurances that the NMDP would be implemented within weeks. An eighteen-member National Standing Committee (NSC), including a representative of the People’s Movement for the Rights of Patients, was appointed in March to oversee and expedite the implementation of the Drug Policy based on the [[Seneka Bibile]] principles of rational drug use. The NSC was advised by the Legal Draftsman that new legislation should be drafted for the establishment of the NMDA.

During 2007, popular pressure for the implementation of the NMPD grew. In October, the Cabinet approved to a Memorandum submitted by Healthcare and Nutrition Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva on the establishment of the National Medicinal Drug Authority (NMDA) and granted its approval to draft a new Act with the assistance of the Legal Draftsman to expedite the implementation of the NMPD by repealing or amending the existing Cosmetics Devices and Drugs Act where necessary.

The '''National Restaurant Association''' is a [[restaurant]] industry [[Trade association|business association]] in the [[United States]], representing more than 380,000 restaurant locations.&lt;ref name="restaurant.org"&gt;[http://www.restaurant.org/aboutus/ About the National Restaurant Association] National Restaurant Association&lt;/ref&gt; It also operates the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation.&lt;ref name="restaurant.org" /&gt; The association was founded in 1919 and is headquartered in Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="restaurant.org" /&gt;  

[[Dawn Sweeney]] is its president and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restaurant.org/aboutus/leaders/president/ National Restaurant Association President and CEO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420123142/http://www.restaurant.org/aboutus/leaders/president/ |date=2010-04-20 }} Dawn Sweeney, President &amp; CEO bio&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 Chair of the Board is Roz Mallet of PhaseNext Hospitality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restaurant.org/aboutus/leaders/chair/ National Restaurant Association Chair 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent association chairs included [[Sally J. Smith]] of [[Buffalo Wild Wings]] and [[Edward R. Tinsley]] of [[New Mexico]], the franchiser of [[K-Bob's Steakhouse]] restaurant chain.&lt;ref name="restaurant.org" /&gt;

==Lobbying==
The National Restaurant Association, widely referred to as "the other NRA" to distinguish itself from [[National Rifle Association]], which shares the [[initialism]], is a powerful lobbying force in [[Washington, DC]], and in state capitals. It is very active in fighting efforts to raise the [[minimum wage in the United States]] as well as laws requiring paid [[sick leave]]. In July 2013, it boasted that it had successfully lobbied against raises in the [[minimum wage]] in 27 of 29 states and blocked paid sick leave legislation in 12 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Rosenfeld | first = Steven | title =  The other NRA: How the National Restaurant Association ensures poverty wages | work = salon.com  | date = August 28, 2013 | url = http://www.salon.com/2013/08/28/the_other_nra_how_the_national_restaurant_association_ensures_poverty_wages_partner/ | accessdate = 2013-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also takes credit for halting any increase in the federal minimum wage for tipped employees, which has remained at $2.13 per hour since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Jamieson | first = Dave | title = Minimum Wage For Restaurant Servers Remains Stagnant For 20 Years Under Industry Lobbying | work = The Huffington Post | date = June 2, 2012 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/02/minimum-wage-restaurant-workers_n_1515916.html | accessdate = 2013-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fiore (May 14, 2014). [http://billmoyers.com/2014/05/14/hard-to-stomach/ “Hard to Stomach”]. ''[[Moyers &amp; Company]].'' Retrieved June 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRA supported the [[Fighting Hunger Incentive Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to make permanent extend and to expand certain expired provisions that provided an enhanced tax deduction for businesses that donated their food [[inventory]] to [[charitable organizations]].&lt;ref name=4719cbo&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4719|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45425|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NRA argued that "the deduction for charitable donation of food inventory is a critical tool in alleviating hunger" because it "encourages donating the food to charity, by helping to offset the costs associated with preserving, storing and transporting the extra food."&lt;ref name=NRAsupportletter&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeFife|first1=Scott|title=Letter to Congressman Reed|url=http://www.restaurant.org/Downloads/PDFs/HR-4719-Support-Letter|publisher=National Restaurant Association|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRA opposed the [[National Labor Relations Board]]'s joint employer standard, but was unable to affect a change in legislation repealing the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/15/cicely-simpson-lobbyist-resigns-649396 |publisher=''[[Politico]]'' |date=June 15, 2018 |title=Top lobbyist for restaurant group departs amid internal discord |first=Marianne |last=Levine |first2=Daniel |last2=Lippman |first3=Helena Bottemiller |last3=Evich |quote=It has pushed for repeal of the National Labor Relations Board’s so-called joint employer standard, but the Obama administration’s standard, which broadened the scope under which a franchiser could be held liable for labor law violations of a franchisee, remains in place.

==Other programs==
The National Restaurant Association develops food safety training and certification program for restaurant employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servsafe.com ServSafe Food Safety] ServSafe Food Safety website.&lt;/ref&gt; It also offers scholarships to foodservice and hospitality management and culinary students through NRAEF, and it runs a national program for high school students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prostart.restaurant.org ProStart] ProStart website.&lt;/ref&gt; The NRA also presents a series of awards, including the Faces of Diversity, the American Dream Awards, and the Restaurant Neighbor Award &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restaurant.org/sustainability/industryawards/] Industry Awards Website.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It runs an annual restaurant and hospitality industry trade show in the US, in [[Chicago]], and conducts research about the country's restaurant industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restaurant.org/show NRA Show] NRA Show website&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, it states that the restaurant industry in the US and is growing rapidly and now employs 12.9 million Americans in 970,000 locations, with sales in 2012 expected to reach $632 billion.&lt;ref name="restaurant.org"/&gt;

The National Restaurant Association also helps restaurant owners increase their environmental sustainability efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conserve.restaurant.org Conserve: Solutions for Sustainability] Conserve: Solutions for Sustainability website.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, the National Restaurant Association teamed up with [[Healthy Dining Finder|Healthy Dining]] to launch Kids LiveWell, a program that helps restaurants increase healthful options on kids' menus and makes it easy for parents to find those options when dining out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restaurant.org/kidslivewell Kids LiveWell] Kids LiveWell website.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The association works closely with its state restaurant and hospitality association partners and provides its members with tools and solutions to improve their business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restaurant.org/aboutus/states/ State restaurant associations].&lt;/ref&gt; It also organizes conferences and networking events for its members. There are six membership categories: Restaurant, Allied, Faculty, Student, Nonprofit, and International.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restaurant.org/aboutus/states/ State restaurant associations] State restaurant associations.&lt;/ref&gt;

The association lobbies for the restaurant and foodservice industry and represents the industry on [[Capitol Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restaurant.org/advocacy/ National Restaurant Association Advocacy &amp; Representation]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the largest food and beverage [[political action committee]] contributor to both the U.S. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Parties in the 2004 election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/industry.asp?txt=N01&amp;cycle=2004 |title=Food &amp; Beverage PAC Contributions to Federal Candidates, 2003-2004 |accessdate=2008-03-13 |publisher=The Center for Responsive Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association is actively opposing the lowering of the federal [[blood alcohol content]] limit from .08% to .05% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Frumkin | first = Paul | title = NTSB proposes lowering legal blood alcohol limit for driving; Restaurant industry associations oppose the proposed reduction from 0.08 to 0.05 | work = Nation's Restaurant News | date = May 14, 2013 | url = http://nrn.com/government/ntsb-proposes-lowering-legal-blood-alcohol-limit-driving | accessdate = 2013-12-20}}

An '''open contact''' is a term used in dentistry to describe the space between adjacent [[teeth]] when the teeth are neither touching nor a sufficient distance from each other to potentially allow the space to naturally remain free of debris.

Open contacts can exist naturally, such as when teeth erupt into a nonideal [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]] or when they shift as a result of tooth loss.  They are also frequently produced as a result of inadequately contoured [[dental restoration]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethesda.med.navy.mil/careers/postgraduate_dental_school/prosthodontics_residency/literature/Section_051_Restorative%20Contours.doc Section 51 - Restorative Contours] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221185805/http://www.bethesda.med.navy.mil/careers/postgraduate_dental_school/prosthodontics_residency/literature/Section_051_Restorative%20Contours.doc |date=December 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[research design]], especially in [[psychology]], [[social sciences]], [[life sciences]], and [[physics]], '''operationalization''' is a process of defining the measurement of a phenomenon that is not directly [[Measurement|measurable]], though its existence is inferred by other phenomena. Operationalization thus defines a [[fuzzy concept]] so as to make it clearly distinguishable, measurable, and understandable by [[empirical observation]]. In a broader sense, it defines the [[Extension (semantics)|extension]] of a [[concept]]—describing what is and is not an instance of that concept. For example, in medicine, the phenomenon of [[health]] might be operationalized by one or more indicators like [[body mass index]] or [[tobacco smoking]]. As another example, in visual processing the presence of a certain object in the environment could be inferred by measuring specific features of the light it reflects. In these examples, the phenomena are difficult to directly observe and measure because they are general/abstract (as in the example of health) or they are [[latent variables|latent]] (as in the example of the object). Operationalization helps infer the existence, and some elements of the extension, of the phenomena of interest by means of some observable and measurable effects they have.

Sometimes multiple or competing alternative operationalizations for the same phenomenon are available. Repeating the analysis with one operationalization after the other can determine whether the results are affected by different operationalizations. This is called checking robustness. If the results are (substantially) unchanged, the results are said to be ''robust against certain alternative operationalizations'' of the checked variables.
 
The concept of operationalization was first presented by the British physicist N. R. Campbell in his 'Physics: The Elements' (Cambridge, 1920). This concept spread to [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. It remains in use in physics.&lt;ref&gt;Inguane, R., Gallego-Ayala, J., &amp; Juízo, D. (2013).

==Theory==
{{See also| Operational definition| Theoretical definition}}

===History===
Operationalization is the scientific practice of ''[[operational definition]]'', where even the most basic [[concept]]s are defined through the operations by which we measure them. The practice originated with the [[philosophy of science]] book ''[[The Logic of Modern Physics]]'' (1927), by [[Percy Williams Bridgman]], whose methodological position is called '''operationalism'''.&lt;ref&gt;The operationalist thesis—which can be considered a variation on the [[Positivism|positivist]] theme—was that all theoretical terms must be defined via the operations by which one measured them; see Crowther-Heyck, Hunter (2005), ''Herbert A. Simon: The Bounds of Reason in Modern America'', JHU Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LV1rnS9NBjkC&amp;pg=PA65 p. 65].&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridgman wrote that in the [[theory of relativity]] a concept like "duration" can split into multiple different concepts. In refining a physical theory, it may be discovered that what was thought to be one concept is actually two or more distinct concepts. Bridgman proposed that if only operationally defined concepts are used, this will never happen.

Bridgman's theory was criticized because "length" is measured in various ways (e.g. it's impossible to use a [[measuring rod]] to measure the distance to the Moon), so "length" logically isn't ''one'' concept but ''many'', some concepts requiring knowledge of [[geometry]]. Each concept is to be ''defined by'' the measuring operation used. Another example is the radius of a sphere, obtaining different values depending on the way it is measured (say, in metres and in millimeters). Bridgman said the concept is defined on the measurement. So the criticism is that there are potentially infinite concepts, each defined by the methods that measured it, such as angle of sighting, day of the solar year, angular subtense of the moon, etc. which were gathered together, some astronomical observations taken over a period of thousands of years.

===Operationalization===
The practical 'operational definition' is generally understood as relating to the [[theoretical definition]]s that describe reality through the use of [[theory]].

The importance of careful operationalization can perhaps be more clearly seen in the development of [[Introduction to general relativity|General Relativity]]. Einstein discovered that there were two operational definitions of "[[mass]]" being used by scientists: ''inertial'', defined by applying a force and observing the acceleration, from [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second Law of Motion]]; and ''gravitational'', defined by putting the object on a scale or balance. Previously, no one had paid any attention to the different operations used because they always produced the same results,&lt;ref name=TwoNewSciences&gt;[[Galileo]] (1638) ''[[Two New Sciences]]'', particularly the [[Law of falling bodies]]&lt;/ref&gt; but the key insight of Einstein was to posit the [[Equivalence principle|Principle of Equivalence]] that the two operations would always produce the same result because they were equivalent at a deep level, and work out the implications of that assumption, which is the General Theory of Relativity. Thus, a breakthrough in science was achieved by disregarding different operational definitions of scientific measurements and realizing that they both described a single theoretical concept. Einstein's disagreement with the operationalist approach was criticized by Bridgman&lt;ref&gt;P.W. Bridgman, ''Einstein's Theories and the Operational Point of View'', in: P.A. Schilpp, ed., ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist'', Open Court, La Salle, Ill., Cambridge University Press, 1982, Vol. 2, p. 335–354.&lt;/ref&gt; as follows: "Einstein did not carry over into his general relativity theory the lessons and insights he himself has taught us in his special theory." (p.&amp;nbsp;335).

==In the social sciences==
[[File:Operationalization of Free and Fair Judiciary.png|thumb|400px|An operationalization diagram, used to illustrate obscure or ambiguous concepts in an academic paper. This particular example is tailored to use in the field of Political Science.]]

Operationalization is often used in the [[social sciences]] as part of the [[scientific method]] and [[psychometrics]]. Particular concerns about operationalization arise in cases that deal with complex concepts and complex stimuli (e.g., business research, software engineering) where unique threats to validity of operationalization are believed to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lukyanenko|first1=Roman|last2=Evermann|first2=Joerg|last3=Parsons|first3=Jeffrey|title=Instantiation Validity in IS Design Research|journal=LNCS|date=2014|volume=8463|pages=321–328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anger example===
For example, a researcher may wish to measure the concept "anger." Its presence, and the depth of the emotion, cannot be directly measured by an outside observer because anger is intangible.  Rather, other measures are used by outside observers, such as facial expression, choice of vocabulary, loudness and tone of voice; after Damasio, [[lesion|Lesion studies]].&lt;ref name=Damasio&gt;[[Antonio Damasio]] (1999) ''[http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/faculty/pylyshyn/Consciousness_2014/Emotions/10-Damasio-OCR.pdf The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness]'' ch.2&lt;/ref&gt;

If a researcher wants to measure the depth of "anger" in various persons, the most direct operation would be to ask them a question, such as "are you angry", or "how angry are you?".   This operation is problematic, however, because it depends upon the definition of the individual.  Some people might be subjected to a mild annoyance, and become slightly angry, but describe themselves as "extremely angry," whereas others might be subjected to a severe provocation, and become very angry, but describe themselves as "slightly angry."  In addition, in many circumstances it is impractical to ask subjects whether they are angry.

Since one of the measures of anger is loudness, the researcher can operationalize the concept of anger by measuring how loudly the subject speaks compared to his normal tone. However, this must assume that loudness is uniform measure. Some might respond verbally while other might respond physically.

===Economics objections===
One of the main critics of operationalism in social science argues that "the original goal was to eliminate the subjective [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] concepts that had dominated earlier psychological theory and to replace them with a more operationally meaningful account of human behavior. But, as in economics, the supporters ultimately ended up "turning operationalism inside out".&lt;ref&gt;Green 2001 ''Operationism Again: What Did Bridgman Say? What Did Bridgman Need?'' in Theory and Psychology 11 (2001) p.49&lt;/ref&gt; "Instead of replacing 'metaphysical' terms such as 'desire' and 'purpose'" they "used it to legitimize them by giving them operational definitions." Thus in psychology, as in economics, the initial, quite radical operationalist ideas eventually came to serve as little more than a "reassurance fetish"&lt;ref name="Koch1992p275"&gt;Koch, Sigmund (1992) ''Psychology’s Bridgman vs. Bridgman’s Bridgman: An Essay in Reconstruction.'', in ''Theory and Psychology'' vol. 2 no. 3  (1992) p.275&lt;/ref&gt; for mainstream methodological practice."&lt;ref&gt;Wade Hands (2004) [http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/112364/on_operationalisms_and_economics/ "On operationalisms and economics" (December 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tying to conceptual frameworks==
{{See also| Conceptual framework}}

The above discussion links operationalization to measurement of [[concept]]s. Many scholars have worked to operationalize concepts like [[job satisfaction]], prejudice, anger etc.  Scale and index construction are forms of operationalization. There is not one perfect way to operationalize. For example, in the United States the concept distance driven would be operationalized as miles, whereas [[kilometers]] would be used in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields]] and Nandhini Rangarajan. 2013. [http://store.newforums.com/A-Playbook-for-Research-Methods-SEB005.htm ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management'']. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. For a detailed discussion of operationalization extending the example above see Shields &amp; Rangarajan pp. 32 to 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operationalization is part of the [[empirical research]] process&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields]] and Nandhini Rangarajan. 2013. [http://store.newforums.com/A-Playbook-for-Research-Methods-SEB005.htm ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management'']. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Take for example an empirical research question: Does job satisfaction influence job turnover?  Both job satisfaction and job turnover need to be measured. The concepts and their relationship are important — operationalization occurs within a larger framework of concepts.   When there is a large empirical research question or purpose the conceptual framework that organizes the response to the question must be operationalized before the data collection can begin.  If a scholar constructs a questionnaire based on a conceptual framework, they have operationalized the framework.  Most serious empirical research should involve operationalization that is transparent and linked to a conceptual framework.

To use an oversimplified example, the [[hypothesis]] ''Job satisfaction reduces job turnover'' is one way to connect (or frame) two concepts – job satisfaction and job turnover. The process of moving from the idea ''job satisfaction'' to the set of questionnaire items that form a job satisfaction scale is operationalization. For most of us, operationalization outside the larger issue of a research question and [[conceptual framework]] is just not very interesting.

Operationalization uses a different logic when testing a formal (quantitative) hypothesis and testing [[working hypothesis]] (qualitative). For formal hypotheses the [[concept]]s are represented empirically (or operationalized) as numeric variables and tested using [[inferential statistics]]. Working hypotheses (particularly in the social and administrative sciences), on the other hand, are tested through evidence collection and the assessment of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields]] and Nandhini Rangarajan (2013). [http://store.newforums.com/A-Playbook-for-Research-Methods-SEB005.htm ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management'']. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. pp. 109-158.&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence is generally collected within the context of a [[case study]]. The researcher asks - Is the evidence sufficient to 'support' the working hypothesis? Formal operationalization would specify the kinds of evidence needed to support the hypothesis as well as evidence which would "fail" to support it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields]] and Nandhini Rangarajan (2013). [http://store.newforums.com/A-Playbook-for-Research-Methods-SEB005.htm ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management'']&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Yin recommends developing a case study protocol as a way to specify the kinds of evidence needed during the data collection phases. He identifies six sources of evidence 1) documentation; 2) archival records; 3) [[interviews]]; 4) direct observations; 5) [[participant observation]] and 6) physical or  [[cultural artifact]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Yin. 1994. ''Case Study Research: Design and Methods.'' (2nd edition). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. pp. 63–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of public administration, [[Patricia M. Shields|Shields]] and Tajalli (2006) have identified five kinds of conceptual frameworks ([[working hypothesis]], descriptive categories, practical ideal type, operations research, and formal [[hypothesis]]). They explain and illustrate how each of these conceptual frameworks can be operationalized. They also show how to make conceptualization and operationalization more concrete by demonstrating how to form conceptual framework tables that are tied to the literature and operationalization tables that lay out the specifics of how to operationalize the conceptual framework (measure the concepts).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shields|first=Patricia|author2=Hassan Tajalli|year=2006|title=Intermediate Theory: The Missing Link to successful Student Scholarship|journal=Journal of Public Affairs Education|volume=12|issue=3|pages=313–334|url=http://ecommons.txstate.edu/polsfacp/39/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M.

'''''Reibl v Hughes''''' [1980] 2 S.C.R. 880 is a leading decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on negligence, medical malpractice, [[informed consent]], the duty to warn, and causation.

The case settled the issue of when a physician may be sued for [[battery (crime)|battery]] and when it is more appropriate to sue the doctor in negligence. The Court wrote unanimously that "unless there has been misrepresentation or fraud to secure consent to the treatment, a failure to disclose the attendant risks, however serious, should go to negligence rather than to battery."  The case also marked the creation of a standard whereby a physician must give the patient sufficient information so that an objective, reasonable person in the patient's position would be able to make an informed choice about a medical procedure.

==Background==
Robert A. Hughes, a physician, was in the process of competently performing an [[endarterectomy]] on his patient, John Reibl, when Reibl suffered a massive stroke.  Paralysis and impotence resulted.  Reibl alleged that he had not truly given informed consent, and as such the surgery constituted battery.&lt;ref name="Reibl"&gt;[http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1980/1980scr2-880/1980scr2-880.html], Reibl v. Hughes Court Ruling&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Reibl was aware that the surgery was not without risks, he felt that Hughes had implied that the risks of not having the surgery were greater.  Reibl was eighteen months away from obtaining a lifetime pension, and the stroke prevented him from earning that pension.  He stated that if he had been aware of the risks in the surgery, he would have waited the year and a half to earn his pension before undergoing the procedure, even if it meant a shortened life.

In the original trial, Reibl was awarded monetary damages for negligence and battery, irrespective of his having signed a formal consent form.  On appeal to the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]], the court directed that a new trial be held, but that the charge of battery be disallowed from the new proceedings.

==Ruling==
It is a general principle in [[tort|tort law]] that a defendant is not liable for damages unless their negligence was the ''cause'' of the injury to the plaintiff.

In the context of a [[medical malpractice]] claim where it is alleged the doctor failed to inform the patient of a risk, the doctor will not be held liable if the patient would have had the procedure anyway (even if they knew of the risk).

''Reibl v. Hughes'' the Supreme Court outlined a "modified objective test" for causation in medical malpractice. It is well established in Canadian law that a doctor cannot be sued for not disclosing information if the patient would have consented to the operation irrespective of whether or not the information was disclosed.

Consider this example: your doctor knows that a surgery has a 5% chance of causing complete paralysis but does not tell you. Without the operation, however, you will very likely die within 12 months.

The court looked at two approaches: an objective test ("what would a reasonable person do?") and a subjective ("what would this plaintiff have done?"). There was concern that an objective test favors the doctor while a subjective test favors the plaintiff.

In an objective test, the Court would accept medical evidence that the chance of paralysis was 5% and the chance of death was high. A reasonable person, thinking rationally, would take the risk of paralysis over death.

If it were a subjective test, the Court would ask the plaintiff. Logically, the plaintiff, who is paralysed will say "no." Logically, if the plaintiff said they would have had the operation anyway, they would not be suing the doctor.

In ''Reibl'', The Court created a "modified objective test" which starts with the "reasonable person" and adds some of the characteristics of the plaintiff, such as age, sex, and family circumstances but will not allow "irrational beliefs" to be taken into account.

The test has been frequently used to determine many medical malpractice and negligence cases, including Arndt v. Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1997/1997scr2-539/1997scr2-539.html Arndt v. Smith], [1997] 2 SCR 539&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013''', often known by the [[acronym]] '''RIDDOR''', is a 2013 [[statutory instrument]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It regulates the [[statute|statutory]] obligation to report [[death]]s, [[injury|injuries]], [[disease]]s and "dangerous occurrences", including near misses, that take place at [[employment|work]] or in connection with work.&lt;ref name=hse&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/riddor/ UK Government advice site] accessed 5 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=law&gt;{{UK SI|year=2013|number=1471|title=The Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OaksCollieryDisaster1866.jpg|One of the worst colliery explosions – [[The Oaks explosion|the Oaks colliery disaster]] killed more than 300 people in 1866.&lt;ref name=oaks&gt;[http://public-art.shu.ac.uk/pmsa/barnsley/0000003a.htm Memorial to the Oaks disaster] accessed 9 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The "even today... claim lacks a citation. What evidence is there for this? --&gt;|thumb|left]]
The regulations require "responsible persons" to report deaths at work, major injuries caused by accidents at work, injuries to persons not at work that require [[hospital]] treatment, injuries arising from accidents in hospitals, and dangerous occurrences (reg.3(1)). Additionally, the law requires registered [[Council for Registered Gas Installers|gas fitter]]s to report poor and dangerous gas installations (reg.6).

Responsible persons are generally employers but also include various managers and occupiers of premises (reg.2). Though the regulations do not impose a specific obligation on employees, they have a general obligation under section 7 of the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]] to take care of safety. The [[Health and Safety Executive]] recommends that they report incidents to their employer and encourages voluntary notification to the relevant regulating authority.&lt;ref name=hse/&gt;

There are specific regulations as to [[Mining|mines]] and [[quarries]] (reg.8/ Sch.5), and [[oil platform|offshore installations]] (reg.9/ Sch.6).

[[Medical treatment]]s are exempt, as are injuries arising from [[road traffic accident]]s&lt;ref&gt;''R (on the application of Aineto) v. HM Coroner for Brighton and Hove'' [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/1896.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[2003]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWHC 1896 (Admin)]&lt;/ref&gt; and to members of the [[armed forces]] (reg.10).

Breach of the regulations is a [[crime]], punishable on [[summary conviction]] with a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] of up to £400. If convicted on [[indictment]] in the [[Crown Court]], an offender can be sentenced to an unlimited fine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]], [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=health+and+safety+at+work+etc+act&amp;Year=1974&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1316700&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1316745&amp;VersionNumber=2&amp;filesize=56647 ss.33(1)(c), 33(3)]&lt;/ref&gt; Either an individual or a [[body corporate|corporation]] can be punished&lt;ref&gt;[[Interpretation Act 1978]], s.5&lt;/ref&gt; and sentencing practice is published by the [[Sentencing Guidelines Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sentencing-guidelines.gov.uk/guidelines/other/courtappeal/default.asp?T=Cases&amp;catID=11&amp;subject=HEALTH%20AND%20SAFETY%20OFFENCES | title=(K) Miscellaneous offences - Health and Safety offences | work=Guideline Judgements Case Compendium | publisher=Sentencing Guidelines Council | accessdate=2008-03-08 | year=2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003033354/http://www.sentencing-guidelines.gov.uk/guidelines/other/courtappeal/default.asp?T=Cases&amp;catID=11&amp;subject=HEALTH%20AND%20SAFETY%20OFFENCES | archivedate=3 October 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2000, [[City of Salford|Salford City Council]] were fined £115,000 for a breach of the regulations.&lt;ref&gt;''R (on the application of Rowley) v. DPP'' [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/693.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[2003]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWHC 693 (Admin)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[defence (law)|defence]] that the responsible person [[knowledge (English law)|was not aware]] of the event requiring reporting or notification and that he had taken all [[reasonable man|reasonable]] steps to have such events brought to his notice (reg.11). The [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] of such a defence is on the [[defendant]], on the [[balance of probabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], s.101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The reporting of accidents and ill health at work has long been a legal requirement in the UK. The information enables the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) and [[Subdivisions of the United Kingdom|local government authorities]] "to identify where and how [[risk]]s arise, and to investigate serious accidents".&lt;ref name=hse/&gt;

During 2006-2007 about 30 million working days were lost due to work-related ill health, and 6 million due to workplace injury. In the same period, there were 141,350 incidents reported although it has been estimated that some 274,000 ought to have been reported. Further, 241 people were killed at work during this time. This figure obscures the fact that in 2005, 2037 people died from [[mesothelioma]] arising from previous exposure to [[asbestos]] and "thousands more from other occupational [[cancer]]s and [[lung disease]]s".&lt;ref name=stat&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/index.htm HSE statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Regulations were intended to consolidate a number of earlier regulations on the reporting of accidents and diseases, generally in the workplace and specifically in the railway and offshore industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1995/Uksi_19953163_en_11.htm#exnote | publisher=Office of Public Sector Information | title=Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995: Explanatory note | accessdate=2008-03-08 | year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notification==
Notification must be made by a responsible person to the relevant enforcing authority which is a body, possibly the local government authority, to which the HSE has delegated its powers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]], s.18&lt;/ref&gt; Notification must be made when any person, not necessarily an employee (reg.3):
*Dies as a result of an accident at work;
&amp;mdash; or, when any person other than an employee suffers:
*An injury as a result of an accident at work and that person has to be taken to [[hospital]]; or
*A major injury as a result of an accident at work that takes place at a hospital;
&amp;mdash; or, when an employee:
*Suffers a major injury as a result of an accident at work; or
*Is incapacitated, either under his [[contract of employment]] or for seven consecutive days (three days prior to 6 April 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/riddor/reporting-change.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204125421/http://www.hse.gov.uk/riddor/reporting-change.htm |archivedate=4 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of an accident at work;
&amp;mdash; or, there is a dangerous occurrence.

"Accident" includes [[assault]]s on employees and [[suicide]]s on transport systems (reg.2). The report must be made by the "quickest practicable means" and confirmed by a written report within ten days (reg.3(2)). When an accident at work results in a reportable injury that, within a year of the accident, causes the death of the employee, the death itself must be reported, even if the accident and injury have already been reported (reg.4).
On occasions, an injury may caused a member of staff to be off work for more than seven working days, or prevent them from completing their normal work duties. If this situation arises then the company must notify the enforcing authority of the incident. When calculating the seven consecutive days, the day of the accident is not counted but the period after is, including weekends. For example, if an employee normally works Monday to Friday, is injured on a Tuesday and does not return to work until the following Thursday, then the incident will be required to be reported. This is because he/she will have been off work for eight days i.e. Wednesday to Wednesday inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/the-reporting-of-injuries-diseases-and-dangerous-occurrence-regulations |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306091034/http://www.citation.co.uk/health-and-safety/the-reporting-of-injuries-diseases-and-dangerous-occurrence-regulations |archivedate=6 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }} The Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Occurrence Regulations (RIDDOR)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''right to an adequate standard of living''' is recognized as a [[human right]] in [[international human rights instruments]] and is understood to establish a minimum entitlement to food, clothing and housing at an adequate level.&lt;ref name=ohch&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=Poverty and Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/poverty/expert/docs/Thomas_Pogge_Summary.pdf|website=ohchr.org|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[right to food]] and the [[right to housing]] have been further defined in [[human rights instruments]]. 

The right to an adequate standard of living is enshrined in Article 25 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and Article 11 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Bourquain| first = Knut| title = Freshwater access from a human rights perspective: a challenge to international water and human rights law| publisher = [[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]] | year = 2008| pages = 137| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QbzDZlNLeNkC&amp;dq=right+to+an+adequate+standard+of+living&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-04-16954-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant inspiration for the inclusion of the right to an adequate standard of living in the UDHR was the [[Four Freedoms speech]] by US President [[Franklin Roosevelt]], which declared amongst others the "'''freedom from want'''". Fulfillment of the right to an adequate standard of living depends on a number of other [[economic, social and cultural rights]], including the [[right to property]], the [[right to work]], the [[right to education]] and the [[right to social security]]. There have been a number of proposed policies to guarantee people a basic standard of living through the concept of offering a [[basic income guarantee]] essentially gifting all citizens a basic level of "free money" in order to meet basic needs such as food and shelter.

The most significant inspiration for the inclusion of the right to an adequate standard of living in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) was the 1941 [[Four Freedoms speech]] by US President [[Franklin Roosevelt]], which declared [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of faith]], [[freedom from want]] and [[freedom from fear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| pages = 524 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of the speech the [[American Law Institute]] established a draft proposals for an international bill of rights, the ''Statement of Essential Human Rights'', which greatly influenced the UDHR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| pages = 527 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The statement included the right to adequate food and housing and the right to social security, including the right to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| pages = 528 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 25 of the UDHR recognises the right to an adequate standard of living, stating that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"(1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.
(2) Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All Children, whether born in or out of wedlock shall enjoy the same social protection."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Universal declaration of Human Rights| publisher = United Nations| url = https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The UDHR establishes that the realisation of the right to an adequate standard of living requires as a minimum the enjoyment of subsistence rights, that is adequate food and nutrition, clothing, housing and care when required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| pages = 523 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UDHR recognises that the right to an adequate standard of living will require different measures depending on the situation of a person. It specifies that persons who are unable to secure the enjoyment of conditions necessary for an adequate standard of living have a right to care. Article 25 is closely related to Article 22 of the UDHR, which explicitly enshrines the [[right to social security]]. Article 25 also specifically mentions the rights of children born out of wedlock, which historically have been subject to discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| pages = 524 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of the right to an adequate standard of living was further defined in Article 11 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| pages = 523 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which defines the right to an adequate standard of living in two paragraphs. Paragraph one states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The States Parties to the present Covenant, recognizing the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, shall take, individually and through international co-operation, the measures, including specific programmes, which are needed:
(a) To improve methods of production, conservation and distribution of food by making full use of technical and scientific knowledge, by disseminating knowledge of the principles of nutrition and by developing or reforming agrarian systems in such a way as to achieve the most efficient development and utilization of natural resources;
(b) Taking into account the problems of both food-importing and food-exporting countries, to ensure an equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to need."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303114220/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As such Article 11 of the ICESCR establishes two human rights, the right to be free from hunger, known as the [[right to food]], and the right to an adequate standard of living, specifically in relation to [[subsistence]] rights to [[Right to clothing|clothing]], housing and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Bourquain| first = Knut| title = Freshwater access from a human rights perspective: a challenge to international water and human rights law| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 2008| pages = 137| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QbzDZlNLeNkC&amp;dq=right+to+an+adequate+standard+of+living&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-04-16954-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICESCR requires as a minimum that the subsistence rights are protected by the state. The [[right to food]] and the [[right to housing]] have subsequently been defined as independent rights in other [[human rights instruments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Clause| first = Richard Piierre|author2=Weston, Burns H. | title = Human rights in the world community: issues and action| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages = 173 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=enyHJgQvF0AC&amp;dq=right+to+an+adequate+standard+of+living&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-1948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspects of the right to an adequate standard of living, such as the [[right to clothing]] have not received such attention, nor development.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Stephen James, [http://law.anu.edu.au/anzsil/Conferences/2008/Stephen%20James.pdf ''"A Forgotten Right? The Right to Clothing in International Law"''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412083133/http://law.anu.edu.au/anzsil/Conferences/2008/Stephen%20James.pdf |date=2011-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICESC makes it clear that states must take appropriate steps to ensure the realization of the right to an adequate standard of living, by for example requiring the state to take the necessary measures to ensure that hunger does not occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| pages = 530 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to an adequate standard of living is also enshrined in the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]], which aimed to create conditions under which women and mothers would be economically secure and independent. The Convention requires states to end discrimination against women in relation to employment and other economic activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| pages = 531–532 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to an adequate standard of living is reiterated in the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] with Article 27 recognising ever child's right to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development. The parents of the child have primary responsibility to secure this right within their abilities, while the state must take appropriate steps to assist parents and others responsible for children. States must if necessary provide material assistance, particularly in relation to nutrition, clothing and housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| pages = 533 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with other rights ==
Overall the right to an adequate standard of living is understood as a social right, which requires respect for a number of other [[economic, social and cultural rights]], including the [[right to education]] as enshrined in Article 26 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and Articles 13 and 14 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR), the [[right to property]], which is enshrined in Article 17 of the UDHR, the [[right to work]] as enshrined in Article 23 of the UDHR and Article 6 of the ICESCR, and the [[right to social security]] as enshrined in Article 22 of the UDHR and Article 25 of the ICESCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Clause| first = Richard Piierre|author2=Weston, Burns H. | title = Human rights in the world community: issues and action| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages = 173 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=enyHJgQvF0AC&amp;dq=right+to+an+adequate+standard+of+living&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-1948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the right to property, the right to work and the right to social security, three core economic rights, are implemented in combination, it is assumed that an adequate standard of living can normally be secured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| pages = 523 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to private property was a crucial demand in early quests for political freedom and equality, and against feudal control of property. Property can serve as the basis for the entitlements that ensure the realisation of the right to an adequate standard of living. Initially only property owners were granted [[civil and political rights]], such as the [[right to vote]]. The [[right to work]] was enshrined to allow those who do not own property to attain an adequate standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| pages = 533 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today discrimination on the basis of property ownership is recognised as a serious threat to the equal enjoyment of human rights by all and non-discrimination clauses in [[international human rights instruments]] frequently include property as a ground on the basis of which discrimination is prohibited (see the [[right to equality before the law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Alfredsson| first = Gudmundur|author2=Eide, Asbjorn | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a common standard of achievement| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1999| pages = 372 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FmuoB-BlMvEC&amp;dq=%22right+to+property%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-90-411-1168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rybinsk Reservoir''' ({{lang-rus|Ры́бинское водохрани́лище|r=Rybinskoye vodokhranilishche|p=ˈrɨbʲɪnskəɪ vədəxrɐˈnʲilʲɪɕːɪ}}), informally called the '''Rybinsk Sea''', is a water [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] on the [[Volga River]] and its [[tributary|tributaries]] [[Sheksna River|Sheksna]] and [[Mologa River|Mologa]], formed by [[Rybinsk Hydroelectric Station]] dam, located in the [[Tver Oblast|Tver]], [[Vologda Oblast|Vologda]], and [[Yaroslavl Oblast]]s. At the time of its construction, it was the largest man-made body of water on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Josephson. ''Industrialized Nature: Brute Force Technology and the Transformation of the Natural World''. Island Press, 2002. {{ISBN|1-55963-777-3}}. Page 31.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the northernmost point of the Volga. The [[Volga-Baltic Waterway]] starts from there. The principal ports are [[Cherepovets]] in Vologda Oblast and [[Vesyegonsk]] in Tver Oblast.

The construction of the dam in [[Rybinsk]] started in 1935. The filling of the reservoir started on April 14, 1941, and continued until 1947. Some 150,000 people had to be resettled elsewhere, and the historic town of [[Mologa]] in Yaroslavl Oblast along with 663&amp;nbsp;villages have completely disappeared under water. In recent years however, it has been increasingly viewed as a typical example of [[Stalinism]] for its disregard of the interests of the local people affected by the project.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Today the dam is less important for [[hydroelectric power]] supply (output is 346&amp;nbsp;MW) than it used to be, and the [[Environmental degradation|ecological damage]] caused by the reservoir is being reassessed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2296">A '''sensory room''' is a special [[room]] designed to develop a person's sense, usually through special lighting, music, and objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communitylivingwestnorthumberland.ca/services/multisensoryroom.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130005610/http://www.communitylivingwestnorthumberland.ca/services/multisensoryroom.aspx |archivedate=2012-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used as a therapy for children with limited communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;http://sydney.edu.au/health_sciences/speech_pathology/resources/multisensory_room.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

“'''Sensory Room'''” is an [[umbrella term]] used to categorize a broad variety of therapeutic spaces specifically designed and utilized to promote [[self-organization]] and positive change. There are multiple types of sensory rooms and purposes for use that have been created and implemented in different practice areas to date. When used appropriately, sensory rooms: 
*Help to create a [[safe space]]
*Facilitate the [[therapeutic alliance]]
*Provide opportunities for engagement in prevention and crisis de-escalation strategies, as well as a host of other therapeutic exchanges (to teach skills, offer a variety of therapeutic activities, etc.) 
*Promote self-care/self-nurturance, resilience &amp; recovery &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ot-innovations.com/content/view/49/46/&lt;/ref&gt;

Multi-sensory equipment is a vital and effective part in the treatment of [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory disorders]] with children and adults alike.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.altogetherautism.org.nz/multi-sensory-environments-use-people-autism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensory equipment can help [[Child development|develop key life skills]] including [[Language development|vocalization]], [[gross motor skill|gross motor skills]], color recognition and tracking. Examples include sensory rooms, sensory pools, sensory bathrooms and sensory gardens.

They are also sometimes called "multi sensory room", "white room", or "quiet room".&lt;ref name="sydney-manual"&gt;http://sydney.edu.au/health_sciences/speech_pathology/resources/docs/MSR_Manual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SnapHealth''' is an online health care search engine for purchasing medical and diagnostic services in cash-based transactions. Consumer reviews of medical practices and their services, as well as the price of services are made available before purchase.

SnapHealth does not refer patients selectively to one doctor over others. SnapHealth provides consumers with a search tool to find health related services and tests, as well as a built in ecommerce feature that allows users the option of taking immediate action with the results of our search.

SnapHealth does not induce or reward the referral of business to any particular provider.

== Business model ==

The founders of SnapHealth see that one of the biggest problems in healthcare is that often neither of the two critical players in healthcare:  doctor and patient—know what the tests, procedures or generally what the cost of care is.&lt;ref name="Know-before_you_buy" /&gt;

In efforts to lower health care costs, SnapHealth has created a web platform that allows real-time pricing information so patients are empowered to know what services cost and make decisions around what matters to them.  Medical practices can offer patients value because they don't need to go through the hassles of filing a stack of forms or the headaches of being reimbursed by insurance.&lt;ref name="online-healthcare" /&gt;

SnapHealth provides a database of [[medical personnel|practices]], and charges on a low fee-per-transaction to process payments. It is [[freeware|free of charge]] to join and create a medical practice profile. 

Consumers can find doctors, by searching a [[doctor's visit|service]], office location, gender, or language spoken. A searchable [[database]] also includes [[transparency (behavior)|the price of services]], photographs, educational background and user–submitted reviews.&lt;ref name="low-cost_healthcare" /&gt;

== Availability ==
The service was launched in April 2012 and is currently limited to Houston, Texas. SnapHealth will soon be expanding to other Texas cities like Austin, Dallas and San Antonio.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3028">'''Stop the Spread'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2012/0117/1224310354816.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digimumsni.com/blog/story/safefood-launches-%E2%80%9Cstop-spread%E2%80%9D-campaign-tackle-overweight-and-obesity-epidemic-northern-&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2011/0516/1224297032796.html&lt;/ref&gt; was a multi-media public health awareness campaign by [[Safefood]] aimed at tackling public misconception regarding overweightness and obesity in adults on the island of [[Ireland]]. The campaign was officially launched on 10 May 2011 at the [[Royal College of Physicians]] by [[Minister of State (Ireland)|Minister of State]] at the [[Department of Health and Children]] with responsibility for primary care, [[Róisín Shortall]] T.D.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imt.ie/features-opinion/2011/06/the-strain-on-the-health-service-from-obesity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaign message ==
A key message of the campaign was communicating new information to the public on waist sizes for men and women, and how to measure these correctly. These waist measurements are 32 inches for women and 37 inches for men based on guidelines from the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) for a healthy waist size.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/obesity/WHO_TRS_894/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign used both online and offline media including, TV and radio and outdoor advertising and public relations encouraging members of the public to pick up a free measuring tape from participating pharmacies and check their waist measurements. ''Stop the Spread'' represented the first integrated use of social and digital media by Safefood in a public health awareness campaign.

To raise further awareness of the campaign with the public, an 8-week weight management programme with MLA's in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] was carried out. In total, 32 MLAs participated including the Chair and Deputy Chair of the Health Committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/northern-ireland-mlas-shed-pounds-in-safefood-initiative-16078676.html..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.4ie.ie/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=135255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nigoodfood.com/news_article_name/politicians-join-forces-to-stop-the-spread.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-campaign evaluation ==
Safefood's post campaign research demonstrated that it had successfully achieved its objectives.

* Increase in public awareness of the issue of overweightness and obesity with a 5% increase among adults on the island of Ireland who now consider themselves to be overweight.
* There was also an increased recognition of the scale of the problem which had shifted from 30% (benchmark) to 50% in December 2011 with 1 in 5 claiming to have measured their waist during the campaign.
* 40% reporting that the campaign had motivated them to start losing weight.
* Support of the campaign was secured from over 75% of pharmacies from across the island of Ireland.
* Over 400,000 free measuring tapes were distributed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9750">'''United Front Against Riverblindness''' (UFAR) is a Non-Governmental Development Organization (NGDO)&lt;ref name="NGDO"&gt;[http://www.mectizan.org/nongovernmental-development-organization-ngdo-partners Mectizan partners]&lt;/ref&gt; that provides technical, managerial and financial support for the elimination of riverblindness, or [[onchocerciasis]], in the [[Kasongo]] region of [[Maniema]] province in the east-southern region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC).

UFAR and its partners use the community-directed treatment with [[ivermectin]] (CDTI) approach recommended by the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC), a branch of the World Health Organization (WHO). Each year UFAR ensures the treatment of about one million people in what is referred to as the CDTI Kasongo project to prevent the further transmission of the parasitic disease onchocerciasis to uninfected persons and to halt the progression of the disease in those already infected.

==History==
United Front Against Riverblindness was formed in 2004 and recognized as a 501c3 by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The organization was founded by and is currently led by Executive Director Dr. Daniel Shungu.  UFAR has a small headquarters office in Lawrenceville, NJ and operational offices in Kinshasa and Kasongo, DRC.  The CDTI Kasongo includes eight health zones.

In 2007 treatment was initiated in the health zone of Kasongo, in 2008 it was initiated in the health zones of Kunda, Lusangi, Salamabila and Samba,&lt;ref name="UFAR-1"&gt;[http://www.riverblindness.org/news-files/kunda-samba-treatment-news-release.htm UFAR Concludes Initial Treatment], United Front Against Riverblindness news release&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 it was initiated in the remaining health zones of Kabambare, Kampene and [[Pangi Territory|Pangi]].&lt;ref name="UFAR-2"&gt;[http://www.riverblindness.org/news-files/2009-treatment-plans.htm UFAR Announces Plans to Treat Nearly One Million]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the community-wide mass treatment of all eligible people must be repeated once a year for 10–15 years, approximately three million tablets of Mectizan (ivermectin)  were distributed in 2009 in all eight health zones by some 4,540 trained community workers.

==Governance==
UFAR is governed by a volunteer board of directors that oversees the organization's activities and promotes its objectives and goals. The board is chaired by Jeffrey Yuan, PhD. The board includes members from medicine, academia and industry and includes: Daniel L. Shungu, PhD (Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases),  Roger Youmans, MD (Associate Executive Director, Surgeon &amp; General Practitioner, Former Medical Missionary to DRC and Ghana, Author), Dr. Dennis Bowers (CEO of Life Force Technologies, Inc.), Mrs. Jean Jacobsohn (UFAR Treasurer), Dr. John McGlaughlin (Mathematics Instructor - Philadelphia School District), Dr. Elsie McKee (Church History, Historical Theology - Princeton Theological Seminary), Mr. Charles C. Phillips (Past-Chair, Information Technology, Resource Development, Isles, Inc.), Dr. Robin Rusciano (Political Science, Current Social World Issues - Rider University), Robert J. Vosatka, MD, Ph.D (Board Chair Emeritus, Physician, Teacher, Scientist),  Jeffrey Yuan, PhD (Board Chair, Pharmaceutical Regulatory Affairs Scientist, Merck &amp; Co., Inc.)

An advisory council includes private-sector professionals who lend their expertise in support of the United Front Against Riverblindness organization.
Executive Director Dr. Daniel Shungu manages the day-to-day operations and works with the field staff as well as APOC,&lt;ref name="APOC"&gt;[http://www.worldbank.org/afr/gper/ Global Partnership to Eradicate Riverblindness]&lt;/ref&gt; WHO, the DRC Ministry of Health and other local and international public and private organizations that share in the mission of eradicating onchocerciasis.

==Health program==
=== Disease eradication measures ===
Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease.&lt;ref name="NTD"&gt;[http://ntd-africa.net/ Neglected Tropical Diseases]&lt;/ref&gt; The primary strategy to control onchocerciasis is to interrupt the life cycle of the parasite.&lt;ref name="Water"&gt;[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/oncho/en/ Water Related Diseases]&lt;/ref&gt; Ivermectin, known by its trade name Mectizan, is the only drug available for treating onchocerciasis without severe side effects. The drug rapidly kills microfilariae (immature worms) but not the adult worms. A single oral dose of ivermectin, taken annually for the 10-15 year life span of the adult worms, protects individuals from further progression of onchocerciasis. Merck &amp; Co. manufactures the drug and provides it free&lt;ref name="free"&gt;[http://www.merck.com/corporate-responsibility/access/access-developing-emerging/mectizan-donation-riverblindness/ Donation Program]&lt;/ref&gt; worldwide for the treatment of onchocerciasis.

Onchocerciasis is a parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of the small black fly that breeds along the banks of fast-flowing rivers. People acquire the disease during their regular trips to infested rivers for their routine daily activities such as farming, hunting, fishing and fetching water. Larvae, transmitted to humans through the bite of the small black fly, mature under the skin into adult worms forming visible nodules throughout the body. Pairs of adult worms produce millions of microfilariae during their entire 10-15 year life span. The microfilariae initially cause a rash, severe itching, thickening and depigmentation of the skin, followed by visual impairment and eventually blindness.

===Implementing disease control and treatment measures===
Annual treatment requires annual training of community distributors (one distributor per 100-200 people), and requires that trained local medical staff be on hand during the annual treatment phase for handling any treatment-related severe adverse reactions.

Eight health zones and 116 health centers comprise the CDTI Kasongo region. The people are served by three hospitals and there are 136 medical doctors and nurses in the region. More than 1,700 villages, ranging in size from 100 to more than 65,000 people, are included in the CDTI Kasongo.

===Training community workers===
The Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) program is the strategy whereby people in endemic communities are empowered to play a major role in managing their own health. CDTI has been adopted worldwide as the primary method for mass distribution of Mectizan to control onchocerciasis. UFAR works with these adult volunteers in partnership with APOC, the World Health Organization, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo national government.

Communities choose their own community distributors.&lt;ref name="cdti"&gt;[http://www.who.int/apoc/cdti/howitworks/en/index.html Setting up CDTI programs]&lt;/ref&gt; These village-based volunteers serve as health care workers who are trained to take full control of the ivermectin treatment program in their respective communities. The training includes providing accurate basic information on the disease and the drug in the local languages, instructions on taking the census, ordering and collecting ivermectin from the health center, preparing and conducting community-wide distribution of the drug, submitting treatment reports back to the health center, and monitoring and reporting any unusual adverse reactions. Such active community involvement greatly improves both the therapeutic and the geographic coverage of ivermectin mass distribution programs.

===Health education activities===
Effective treatment includes more than distribution of medicine. It also requires education to address long-held myths about the causes of onchocerciasis. This educational process begins with enlisting the cooperation and participation of the village chief and tribal elders.

===New initiatives===
The United Front Against Riverblindness (UFAR) announces a landmark partnership with Sightsavers, an international development charity. Sightsavers will fund riverblindness prevention and elimination in two remote areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). More than 1.2 million people and 2,728 villages will be added to UFAR's existing program.

Dr. Daniel Shungu, founder of UFAR, says that UFAR will now be able to bring lifesaving medicine to Ituri Nord and Lubutu, in Oriental and Maniema provinces, respectively. "I thank Sightsavers on behalf of UFAR and especially for those in the two new regions whose lives will be positively changed forever as a result of this arrangement. We have a few more challenges to face but, fortunately, finances for these two projects will not be one of them," he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UFAR Blog|url=http://riverblindness.org/SBlog/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Millennium Project''' was an initiative that focused on detailing the organizational means, operational priorities, and financing structures necessary to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] or (MDGs). The goals are aimed at the reduction of [[poverty]], [[hunger]], [[disease]], [[illiteracy]], [[environmental degradation]], and [[discrimination]] against women. At the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Summit]] in September 2000 world leaders had initiated the development of the MDGs and had set a completion date for the project of June 2005.

In order to support the MDGs, UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] and Administrator of the [[UN Development Programme]] (UNDP) [[Mark Malloch Brown, Baron Malloch-Brown|Mark Malloch Brown]] launched the Millennium Project to determine the best strategies for achieving the MDGs. The Project was headed by Professor [[Jeffrey Sachs]].  The Millennium Project worked from 2002 to 2005 to devise a recommended plan of implementation that would allow all [[developing countries]] to meet the MDGs and thereby substantially improve the [[human condition]] by 2015.  The Millennium Project presented its final recommendations in its report to the Secretary-General ''Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals'', completed in January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/reports/index.htm "Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals"]. New&amp;nbsp;York: UN Millennium Project. Director, Jeffrey D. Sachs. 2005. An independent publication, supported by the United Nations Development Programme. unmillenniumproject.org/reports. Retrieved 2017-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten theme-oriented task forces have been created in order to perform the majority of the research. The task forces are an amalgamation of representatives from the academic community, public and private sectors of [[society]], [[civil society]] organizations, and UN agencies that also include participants from outside the UN. Each Task Force is composed of 15-20 members who are all [[international]] leaders in their specific area, and are selected on the basis of their practical experience and technical expertise.

==Eight Goals==
*1 Eradicate extreme hunger and poverty
*2 Achieve universal primary education
*3 Promote gender equality and empower women
*4 Reduce child mortality
*5 Improve maternal health
*6 Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases
*7 Ensure environmental stability
*8 A global partnership for development&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/goals/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waon therapy''', developed in [[Japan]], is a [[sauna]]-like form of [[hyperthermia therapy]] for patients with chronic [[heart failure]].  Waon is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word meaning soothing warmth.  Waon therapy is proposed to improve prognosis and quality of life.&lt;ref name="Miyata"&gt;Miyata, M., Kihara, T., Kubozono, T., Ikeda, Y., Shinsato, T., Izumi, T., Matsuzaki, M., Yamaguchi, T., 	Kasanuki, H., Daida, H., Nagayama, M., Nishigami, K., Hirata, K., Kihara, K. and Tei, C.  Beneficial effects 	of Waon therapy on patients with chronic heart failure: Results of a prospective multicenter study.  Journal of Cardiology (2008)52:79-85&lt;/ref&gt;  The sauna room is an evenly warmed room at {{convert|60|C|F}} with no hydration added.  Patients sit in it for 15 minutes, after which, they are wrapped in thermal blankets and laid down to maintain heat for 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="Miyata" /&gt;

==Benefits==
Chronic [[heart failure]] patients suffer from an inability to pump enough blood to their tissues and heart, resulting in systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction.  Waon therapy improves many indicators of heart function including: [[cardiac output]], [[stroke volume]], [[ejection fraction]], while also having benefits in vascular function including decreased [[vascular resistance]] and [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref name="Tei"&gt;Tei, C., Horikiri, Y., Park, J.C., Jeong, J.W., Change, K.S., Toyama, Y., and Tanaka, N.  Acute Hemodynamic 	Improvement by Thermal Vasodilation in Congestive Heart Failure.  Circulation. 1995;91:2582-2590&lt;/ref&gt;  Improvements were also seen in left ventricular diastolic dimension and left atrial dimension.&lt;ref name="Miyata" /&gt;

==Risks==
Patients with [[aortic stenosis]], obstructive [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] and [[ischemic cardiomyopathy|ischemic cardiomyopathies]] should not use Waon therapy as a treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Miyata, M., Kihara, T., Kubozono, T., Ikeda, Y., Shinsato, T., Izumi, T., Matsuzaki, M., Yamaguchi, T., 	Kasanuki, H., Daida, H., Nagayama, M., Nishigami, K., Hirata, K., Kihara, K. and Tei, C.

Circulation. 1995;91:2582-2590)&lt;/ref&gt; Prohibiting patients with ischemic cardiomyopathies prevents an increase in temperature from further activating the [[sympathetic nervous system]], which could cause [[tachycardia]] in these patients.&lt;ref name="Tei" /&gt;

==Mechanisms==
Waon therapy increases blood flow by stimulating [[endothelial nitric oxide synthase]] protein production (eNOS).  eNOS makes [[nitric oxide]], which is a vasodilator and increases blood flow.&lt;ref name="Shinsato"&gt;Shinsato, T., Miyata, M., Kubozono, T., Ikeda, Y., Fujita, S., Kuwahata, S., Akasaki, Y., Hamasaki, S., Fujiwara, 	H., Tei, C. Waon Therapy mobilizes CD34+ cells and improves peripheral arterial disease.  Journal of 	Cardiology (2010) 56(3)361-366&lt;/ref&gt; Waon therapy also increases blood flow by stimulating the mobilization endothelial progenitor cells marked with [[CD34]] molecules.  CD34 positive cells promote [[angiogenesis]] to increase blood flow, improving cardiac perfusion and decreasing vascular resistance.&lt;ref name="Shinsato" /&gt;  Nitric oxide is also a regulator of the sympathetic nervous system, and an increase of nitric oxide via endothelial nitric oxide synthase may help to control [[autonomic nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Kuwata"&gt;Kuwata, S., Miyata, M., Fujita, S., Kubozono, T., Shinsato, T., Ikeda, y.,  Hamasaki, S., Kuwaki, T. and Tei, C. 	 Improvement of autonomic nervous activity by Waon therapy in patients with chronic heart failure.	Journal of Cardiology (2011)57(1)100-106&lt;/ref&gt;

In chronic heart failure the sympathetic nervous system is over-activated and the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] depressed, increasing stress on the heart.  Waon therapy increases parasympathetic activity and decreases the sympathetic activity.&lt;ref name="Kuwata" /&gt;  These changes decrease stress on the heart by decreasing systemic resistance and increasing cardiac output, which decrease [[preload (cardiology)|preload]] and [[afterload]].&lt;ref name="Tei" /&gt;

[[Brain natriuretic peptide]] (BNP) decreases with Waon therapy.&lt;ref name="Miyata" /&gt;  BNP is a negative indicator of cardiac function and is released during ventricular stretching.&lt;ref name="Miyata" /&gt;

==Long-term results==
A 5 year study of Waon therapy showed a decrease in cardiac death and rehospitalisation after cardiac events.&lt;ref&gt;Kihara, T., Miyata, M., Fukudome, T., Ikeda, Y., Shinsato, T., Kubozoo, T., Fujita, S., Kuwahata, S., Hamasaki,	 S., Torii, H., Lee, S., Toda, H. and Tei, C.  Waon therapy improves the prognosis of patients with chronic 	heart failure.  Journal of Cardiology (2009)53(2)214-218&lt;/ref&gt;  This treatment is currently only being used in Japan, but positive results suggest Waon therapy may be a new, non-pharmacological treatment for chronic heart failure patients and other vascular resistance diseases.
