      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2120">An '''active antenna''' is an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] that contains active electronic components such as [[transistor]]s, as opposed to most antennas which only consist of passive components such as metal rods, [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s.  Active antenna designs allow antennas of limited size to have a wider frequency range ([[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) than passive antennas, and are primarily used in situations where a larger passive antenna is either impractical (inside a portable radio) or impossible (suburban residential area that disallows use of large outdoor low-frequency antennas).

Most active antennas consist of a short conventional antenna, such as a small [[whip antenna]], connected to an active component (usually a [[Field-effect transistor|FET]]). The signal attenuation caused by the antenna-size-to-[[wavelength]] mismatch is compensated by the active circuit. The active circuit consists of an impedance translating stage and an optional amplification stage. This arrangement is especially useful for constructing compact [[low frequency]] antennas which, due to budgetary, spatial, or practical requirements (e.g., installation in vehicles), must be downsized. Low frequency signal wavelengths range from one to ten kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;Gentges, Frank. "The AMRAD Active LF Antenna." QST Sept. 2001: 31-37. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Power for the active components may be supplied by [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], a filtered [[power supply]], or through the signal feeder itself ([[phantom power]]).&lt;ref&gt;Poole, Ian D. "Antenna Systems." Newnes Guide to Radio and Communications Technology. Amsterdam ; London: Newnes, 2003. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt; Antennas containing active impedance translating and optionally amplifying stages are usually used only for receiving, since operation of such stages is unidirectional.

'''Arlen F. Chase''' (born 1953) is a [[Mesoamerica]]n [[archaeologist]] and is faculty member in the anthropology department at the [http://www.unlv.edu University of Nevada, Las Vegas].  Previously, he served as the Departmental Chair at the [[University of Central Florida]], noted for his work on exploring traces of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] civilization using [[lidar]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

== Biography ==

Chase took his BA and PhD in Anthropology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and then worked in the University of Pennsylvania's anthropology department. His fieldwork began with Mesoamerican excavations at [[Holmul]] and [[Orange Walk District|Orange Walk]], Belize with the [[Santa Rita Corozal]] project, Belize, followed by excavations at [[Tikal]], [[Copan]], [[Grasshopper Pueblo]] and [[Quintana Roo]].

Chase moved to the University of Central Florida in 1984. He helped to transform it into one of the top American universities in the study of the Southern Lowland Maya. He and his wife Dr. [[Diane Zaino Chase]] have together published many peer reviewed articles and books on the subjects of [[hieroglyphics]], settlement patterns, urbanism and ceramic studies of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]].

Since 1984, Chase has conducted many excavations in the Petén region of [[Belize]]. From 1985 he has been Co-director of the [[Maya city|Maya urban complex]] of [[Caracol]]. Chase developed excavation techniques to explore the history of Caracol from the Preclassic to the Postclassic period of [[Maya civilization|Maya]] occupation, to reveal the archaeology while preserving the built structures as part of Belize's cultural heritage.

In 2016, he joined the anthropology department at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV).

== Current research ==
{{further|Mesoamerica|Maya civilization}}

Chase teamed with [[University of Central Florida]] biologist Dr John Weishampel to obtain a NASA Space Archaeology Program &amp; UCF-UF Space Research Initiative grant to use [[lidar]] (light radar) sensors to detect changes in the [[rainforest]] canopy, reforestation patterns and modifications to archaeological sites. The lidar system was installed in an aircraft flown over [[Caracol]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/science/11maya.html?scp=3&amp;sq=Mayan+Archaeology+Wilford&amp;st=nyt | title=New York Times | publisher=nytimes.com | work=Mapping Ancient Civilization, in a Matter of Days | date=May 10, 2010 | accessdate=November 9, 2011 | author=Wilford, John Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system used laser beams that were projected to the ground, bounced back and were recorded. These recordings produced a detailed three dimension map of both the Forest canopy and the ruins of Caracol.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.archaeology.org/1007/etc/caracol.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The speed and precision of the system was far superior to traditional ground surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Challis | first=Keith | title=Assessing the Preservation of Temperate, Lowland alluvial Sediments Using Airborne Lidar Intensity | journal=Journal of Archaeological Science | year=2011 | volume=38|issue=2 | pages=301–311 | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2010.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chase|first=Arlen |author2=Diane Chase |author3=John Weishampel|title=Airborne LiDAR Archaeology and the Ancient Maya Landscape at Caracol|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|year=2011|volume=38|issue=2|pages=387–398|doi= 10.1016/j.jas.2010.09.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2013 talk at the University of Minnesota, Arlen and Diane Chase talked about their most recent work at Caracol, including data generated by lidar.&lt;ref&gt;http://ias.umn.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beartooth''' is a highly specialized radio that communicates with similar devices completely independent of cell phone towers or Wi-Fi signals. It has a variety of features: voice, encrypted text, geolocation, and beaconing, along with SOS broadcast capability for any device in range. Its battery pack can double the current battery life of your phone.&lt;ref name="OutsideOnline_2015-01-12" /&gt;  The company was co-founded by businessman Michael Monaghan and Kevin Ames, a former smokejumper and telecommunications expert who designed and implemented ad-hoc communication systems supporting backcountry firefighters.&lt;ref name="GearJunkie_2014-09-11" /&gt;

== Operation ==
{{POV|date=January 2018}}
The Beartooth smartphone accessory, launched at Disrupt SF 2014, allowed you to maintain connection with friends having like devices even when the cellular network fails or is overburdened. The Beartooth accessory combines a 3,000mAh backup battery and a 900Mhz digital radio that functions independent of cellular network or wifi signals. Pair the Beartooth with your smart phone, launch one of their apps, and you’re now connected by voice and text to anyone else with a Beartooth.&lt;ref name="techcrunch_2014-09-08" /&gt;  Beartooth will use short-range radio frequencies to allow you to talk to another Beartooth user within range.&lt;ref name="gizmodo_2014-09-17" /&gt; Users can choose to call a specific Beartooth user or to put a call out to any devices in range, including traditional 2-way radio devices &lt;ref name="Treehugger_2015-01-21" /&gt;

Beartooth has raised $2.9M in venture funding as of June, 2015.&lt;ref name="Crunchbase_2014-08-06" /&gt;

== History ==
BudgetBakers started off as a side project of Jan Muller, who worked as a software developer with leading Czech companies [[Avast Software|Avast]], [[Česká spořitelna|Ceska Sporitelna]] and [[Seznam.cz]]. Having developed the during his free time, Muller gained confidence as angel investor Martin Jiřička came on board as the startup's first investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://budgetbakers.com/blog/meet-bakers-jan-muller-founder-budgetbakers/|title=Meet The Bakers: Jan Muller, Founder of BudgetBakers - Wallet by BudgetBakers|date=2017-03-18|work=Wallet by BudgetBakers|access-date=2017-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dotekomanie.cz/2015/08/budgetbakers-vydava-zbrusu-novou-aplikaci-pro-spravu-financi/|title=BudgetBakers vydává zbrusu novou aplikaci pro správu financí {{!}} Dotekománie.cz|last=Dotekománie.cz|date=2015-08-20|work=Dotekománie.cz|access-date=2017-06-26|language=cs-CZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, BudgetBakers was selected as one among 7 other growing startups to attend the [[startup accelerator]] program hosted by StartupYard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In this three month-program, the startup was able to reshape its vision, plan out its strategies and concentrate on scaling up the product. "By entering SY, we had to slow down development of the new version of BudgetBakers and start focusing more on management, finances and defining the strategy that will bring us to next level. At the beginning it was very unusual for me, because i was used to spending my whole day programming. I had to turn towards management, and that was a challenge for me. But now I have to say, it helped me to crystallize my vision in term of growth and success," said Muller, in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://startupyard.com/meet-the-2015-startups-budgetbakers-stress-free-mobile-finance/|title=Meet the 2015 Startups: BudgetBakers, Stress Free Mobile Finance - StartupYard|date=2015-05-19|work=StartupYard|access-date=2017-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I’ve come to realize that our priority has to be our customer experience and our market strategy, instead of just building an ever richer feature set. There’s no use in creating the world’s most amazing software, if nobody is ready to use that software to make a positive impact in their lives. So we’ve had to adjust our attitude towards development, and grow up as a company and a team. That’s been an amazing experience for us, and we’re really glad we decided to do it."

It was during this period that the present CEO Michal Kratochvil became an advisor to the startup. "Since then, BudgetBakers has grown to over a million registered users, tripling its paying membership since last year, as it has repositioned itself to focus more broadly on personal finance, and rolled out features that allow customers to manage all of their personal finances in one secure cloud platform," says EU-Startups.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eu-startups.com/2016/06/czech-fintech-startup-budgetbakers-raises-e290k-and-welcomes-new-ceo/|title=Czech fintech startup BudgetBakers raises €290K and welcomes new CEO {{!}} EU-Startups|last=Ohr|first=Thomas|website=www.eu-startups.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, BudgetBakers "raised seed funding from startup investor Petr Zamecnik and former CEO of HomeCredit and GE Money, Ivan Svitek. Along with the funding round, BudgetBakers revealed that Michal Kratochvil, former Managing Director of [[Accenture]] in Central Europe, has joined as the startup’s new CEO."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eu-startups.com/2016/06/czech-fintech-startup-budgetbakers-raises-e290k-and-welcomes-new-ceo/|title=Czech fintech startup BudgetBakers raises €290K and welcomes new CEO {{!}} EU-Startups|last=Ohr|first=Thomas|website=www.eu-startups.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tyinternety.cz/startupy/budgetbakers-ziskal-investici-78-milionu-povede-ho-byvaly-reditel-accenture/|title=BudgetBakers s novým CEO získal investici 7,8 milionu|date=2016-06-03|work=Tyinternety.cz|access-date=2017-06-26|language=cs-CZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5507">[[File:20150724 libramont095.JPG|alt=|thumb|A Bobcat compact excavator]]
A '''compact''' or '''mini excavator''' is a tracked or wheeled vehicle with an approximate operating weight from 0.7 to 8.5 tonnes. It generally includes a standard backfill blade and features independent boom swing.

Hydraulic Excavators are somewhat different from other construction equipment in that all movement and functions of the machine are accomplished through the transfer of [[hydraulic fluid]]. The compact excavator's work group and blade are activated by [[hydraulic fluid]] acting upon hydraulic cylinders. The excavator's slew (rotation) and travel functions are also activated by hydraulic fluid powering hydraulic motors.

==Structure==
[[Image:Bobcat 334.jpg|thumb|right|A Bobcat mini excavator. Note the backfill blade]]
Most compact hydraulic excavators have three distinct assemblies: house, undercarriage and workgroup.

===House===
The house structure contains the operator's compartment, engine compartment, [[hydraulic pump]] and distribution components. The house structure is attached to the top of the undercarriage via a swing bearing. The house, along with the workgroup, is able to rotate or slew upon the undercarriage without limit due to a hydraulic distribution valve which supplies oil to the undercarriage components.

'''Slew'''
Slewing refers to rotating the excavator's house assembly. Unlike a conventional [[backhoe]], the operator can slew the entire house and workgroup upon the undercarriage for spoil placement.

[[Image:U25.jpg|thumb|right|A Kubota compact excavator]]

===Undercarriage===

The undercarriage consists of rubber or steel tracks, drive sprockets, rollers, idlers and associated components/structures. The undercarriage supports the house structure and the workgroup.

===Workgroup===

The workgroup of a compact hydraulic excavator consists of the boom, dipper or arm, and attachment (e.g. [[auger (drill)|auger]], bucket or breaker). It is connected to the front of the excavator's house structure via a swing frame that allows the workgroup to be hydraulically pivoted left or right to achieve offset digging for trenching parallel with the tracks. Certain manufacturers including Terex and Caterpillar (CAT) offer an extendable boom option, much like the extendable boom of a backhoe loader.

===Independent Boom Swing===

The primary purpose of boom swing is for offset digging around obstacles or along foundations, walls or forms. A secondary use is cycling in areas too narrow for cab rotation. Independent boom swing is one of the major advantages of a compact excavator over other excavation equipment.

===Backfill blade===

The backfill blade is used for grading, leveling, backfilling, trenching, and general dozer work. The blade can be used to increase dump height and digging depth depending on its position in relation to the excavator's workgroup, this makes it very versatile.

==Attachments==
[[File:NPK GH-07 breaker fitted to a mini-excavator 1.jpg|thumb|A NPK breaker fitted to a Wacker Neuson compact excavator]]
In recent years, hydraulic excavator capabilities have expanded far beyond excavation tasks. With the advent of hydraulic powered attachments such as a [[tiltrotator]], [[breaker (hydraulic)|breaker]], a [[grapple (construction)|grapple]] or an [[auger (drill)|auger]], the excavator is frequently used in many applications other than excavation and with the [[tiltrotator]] attachment, actually serves as an effective tool carrier. Many excavators feature [[quick coupler]] (quick-attach) mounting systems for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the machine's utilization on the jobsite.

==Zero-tail Swing==
[[File:Wacker Neuson Bagger 50Z3.jpg|thumb|right|A Wacker Neuson excavator with zero-tail. The tail does not extend to the street.]]
There are two distinct classes of compact excavators, conventional tail swing - units that have a rear [[counterweight]] that will extend beyond the tracks when the house rotates, and zero-tail swing - units with a house whose diameter stays within the width of the tracks through full rotation. Zero-tail swing units allow operators to focus on digging and not looking at where they are swinging and are intended for operation in limited spaces, like next to a wall.

The '''Conservation Reserve Program''' ('''CRP''') is a cost-share and rental payment program of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA). Under the program, the government pays farmers to take certain agriculturally used croplands out of production and convert them to vegetative cover, such as cultivated or [[native plant|native]] [[bunchgrass]]es and [[grassland]]s, wildlife and [[pollinator]]s food and shelter plantings, [[windbreak]] and [[shade tree]]s, filter and [[buffer strip]]s, [[grassed waterway]]s, and [[riparian buffer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[4]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the program is to reduce land erosion, improve water quality and effect wildlife benefits.

==History==
The program originally began in the 1950s as the conservation branch of the Soil Bank Program which was enacted by the [[Agriculture Act of 1956]]. The theory behind this branch of the Soil Bank Program was to focus on lands that were at high risk of erosion, remove them from agricultural production, and establish native or alternative [[permanent vegetative cover]] in an effort to counteract actual or potential erosion.  This was considered by proponents to be beneficial to [[sustainable agriculture]] generally, by lessening the effects of erosion. Originally, the program called for three-year contracts in which the government would pay for land improvements that increased soil, water, forestry, or wildlife quality if the farmer would agree not to harvest or graze contracted land.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_2_on_20120411102455"&gt;[2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the roots of the program were established in the 1950s, advocates did not start pushing the program heavily until the 1980s, in response to more prevalent practices of the 1970s, whereby farmers increasingly began to cultivate "fence row to fence row", and remove native habitat and vegetative stands from the fields, which was perceived as having detrimental effects on soil, water, and habitat quality [2]. Many programs would be established in the 1980s to address these issues.	

The CRP has gone through many changes. Whenever there is a new proposed Farm Bill, the CRP is a large focus due to a high level of public pressure and the program's perceived benefits.

===1985 Farm Bill===

The [[Farm Bill]] of 1985 was the first act that officially established the CRP as we know it today. Many changes were made in this Farm Bill as compared to the regulations of the program set forth by the Agricultural Act of 1954. One of these changes was changing the contract lengths from the previous three-year commitment to anywhere from 10 to 15 years [7]. The rationale was that this would allow the new [[Permanent vegetative cover|vegetative cover]] and other management practices more time to become established and produce the desired benefits. Also during the time of this Farm Bill, the amount of land allowed to be enrolled in the CRP, which had to be specified as "highly erodible," rose from {{convert|5|e6acre|km2}} in 1986 to {{convert|40|e6acre|km2}} in 1990 [7]. Additionally, this Farm Bill allowed the Secretary of Agriculture to provide up to 50% of the cost to landowners for installing conservation measures [7]. This Bill also prohibited any farming or grazing on land that became enrolled into CRP, effectively removing any CRP land from agricultural production [7].

===1990 Farm Bill===

The Farm Bill of 1990 included a major change to the CRP by expanding the list of eligible lands to include marginal pasture lands converted to [[wetland]]s or established as [[wildlife habitat]] prior to enactment of the 1990 Farm Bill, marginal [[pasture]]lands to be devoted to trees in or near [[riparian]] areas, lands that the Secretary may determine causes an environmental threat to water quality, croplands converted to [[grassed waterway]]s or strips as part of a conservation plan, croplands subject to an easement of the useful life of newly created wildlife habitat, shelterbelts, or filter strips devoted to trees or shrubs, and lands that pose an off-farm environmental threat or pose a threat of degradation of production due to [[soil salinity]] [7]. This large increase in the types of eligible lands allowed for lands that weren’t really "highly erodible," yet not in production either, to be designated as beneficial to the environment around in the area.

Along with that alteration, there were other smaller differences between this Bill and the one previous. The Farm Bill of 1990 allowed limited fall and winter grazing on land enrolled in the CRP, it allowed "alley cropping" between [[hardwood]] tree stands in return for paying less money to the landowner, the 50% cost share was expanded from only vegetative cover to include hardwood trees, shelterbelts, [[windbreak]]s, and [[wildlife corridor]]s, and the Bill allowed for land already in the CRP that had been converted to vegetative cover to be converted to hardwood trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, wildlife corridors, or wetlands under certain circumstances [7]. This was a fundamental change to the Farm Bill program because it shifted the CRP's focus from agricultural conservation and production to more of a natural resource or general [[environmental conservation]] program.

===1996 Farm Bill===

The 1996 Farm Bill did not make many changes to the CRP. The major change made was in relation to early termination of CRP contracts. This bill allowed the termination of contracts after five years, with the exception of filterstrips, waterways, strips adjacent to riparian areas; lands with an [[erodibility]] index of over 15; and other lands that the Secretary deems to be highly sensitive [7]. Also, cropping history became a part of the eligibility system used to determine if a piece of land should be enrolled into the CRP. Land was deemed eligible for CRP if it was cropped two of the last five years and meets at least one of the following requirements: had an erodibility index of eight or higher; was considered a cropped wetland; was associated with or surrounds non-cropped wetlands; was devoted to a highly beneficial environmental practice (for example, filter strips); was subject to scour erosion; was located in national or state CRP conservation priority areas; or was marginal pastureland in riparian areas [7]. Other changes came in the form of appropriation bills. The Appropriations Bill of 2001 provided an exception to the requirement that the owner plant vegetative cover when excessive rainfall or flooding made planting impossible and the Appropriations Bill of 2002 created a new pilot program for enrollment of wetland and buffer acreage in CRP [7].

===2002 Farm Bill===

The changes made to the program in the 2002 Farm Bill changed the cropping history requirements from two out of the previous five years, to four out of the previous six [7]. This was done to make sure the land being enrolled in the program was actually cropland as opposed to land where somebody cropped it for two years just so it could be enrolled. The other change was done to increase the eligibility of lands. Under this Farm Bill, land under expiring contracts is automatically eligible to be considered for re-enrollment; contracts expiring during 2002 could be extended by one year; and existing covers must be retained, if feasible, when expiring contracts are re-enrolled [7].

===2008 Farm Bill===

The 2008 Farm Bill stated that alfalfa grown in approved [[crop rotation]] practice is to be considered an agricultural commodity and can be used to fulfill the requirement that eligible land be cropped in four out of six previous years, which had been challenged in the previous years [1]. Also for the first time, the bill allowed for management and cost-share incentives for thinning to improve condition of resources on the land containing trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, and wildlife corridors [1].

==Agencies involved==

There are four main agencies involved in the program, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), [[Commodity Credit Corporation]] (CCC), the [[Farm Service Agency]] (FSA) and the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS). The USDA is the governing body that works to form the CRP with every Farm Bill and they are the top of the chain of command when it comes to the program. The CCC is the actual corporation, which is controlled by the USDA, that landowners enter into contracts with when enrolling in the program. FSA is the administrative body that runs the program for the USDA so that they don’t have to oversee every aspect of the program. NRCS is the technical agency which supports CRP by implementing it on private lands.

==Enrollment procedures==

Even though the CRP may be beneficial to many aspects of the environment, not every landowner can or might want to become involved in the program.

The main limiting factor in the amount of land allowed in the program is money. Each Farm Bill establishes the amount of money that will be budgeted for rental payments and cost share subsidies. With a limited amount of money available, the NRCS can only allow the most qualified land to be given incentive payments. There are very specific procedures and steps that are taken to decide whether or not land will be admitted to the program.

Moreover, CRP is considered to be undesirable by some land owners because it prevents or minimizes the use of their land for agricultural production and by decreasing farm income.

Continuous Sign-Up Contracts:  Environmentally desirable land devoted to certain conservation practices may be enrolled in CRP at any time under continuous sign-up [10]. Provided the land and the landowner meet the requirements, offers are automatically accepted and not subject to competitive bidding [10].

===Landowner requirements===

To be eligible for CRP continuous sign-up enrollment, a landowner must have owned or operated the land for at least 12 months prior to submitting the offer, unless: the new landowner acquired the land due to the previous landowner’s death, ownership change occurred due to foreclosure where the owner exercised a timely right or redemption in accordance with state law, or the circumstances of the acquisition present adequate assurance to FSA that the new owner did not acquire the land for the purpose of placing it in CRP [10]. Landowners must be U.S. citizens or resident aliens and may not exceed certain income thresholds in order to be eligible for payments.

===Land requirements===

To be eligible for placement in General CRP, land must be recognized as "cropland" (including field margins) that is planted or considered planted to an agricultural commodity 4 of the previous 6 crop years from 1996 to 2001, and which is physically and legally capable of being planted in a normal manner to an agricultural commodity. For Continuous CRP the land must be recognized as "marginal pastureland" that is bordered to a stream, creek, river, sink-hole, and/or duck nest. Also, the land must be suitable for certain conservation practices; which are riparian buffers, wildlife habitat buffers, wetland buffers, filter strips, wetland restoration, grass waterways, shelterbelts, living [[snow fence]]s, contour grass strips, salt tolerant vegetation, and shallow water areas for wildlife [10].

==Contract payments==

There are three main types of payments within CRP. They are rental payments, cost-share assistance, and financial incentives.

===Rental payments===

Landowners receive rental payments from the FSA in return for creating long-term land cover. These payments depend on two main factors: The productivity of the soils in the area and the average dry land crop rent or cash rent equivalent [10]. However, the annual rental rate may not exceed the FSA’s maximum payment amount [10].

===Cost-share assistance===

FSA provides cost-share assistance to participants who establish approved cover on eligible cropland. The cost-share assistance can be an amount not more than 50 percent of the participants' costs in establishing approved practices [10].

===Financial incentives===

As part of or on top of rental rate agreements, the FSA also adds on an additional financial incentive of up to 20% of the soil-rental rate for field windbreaks, grass waterways, filter strips, and riparian buffers [10]. Also, additional percentages could be added to the amount for maintenance and upkeep of the CRP areas [10].

==Environmental benefits==

CRP benefits many [[native plant]]s, animals and [[ecosystem]]s. Even something as simple as a [[Buffer strip|filter strip]] between an [[agricultural field]] and a [[stream]] can have a profound effect on the stability and health of the ecosystems and processes that occur in and around the field, as the greater environment. &lt;!---{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}---&gt;

===Soil erosion===

When CRP first started, the primary goal was to curb [[soil erosion]] due to [[agriculture|agricultural practices]]. The effects of CRP on erosion are clearly visible today. CRP protects soil productivity by establishing conservation covers on at-risk land to reduce sheet, rill, and wind erosion. As of December 1, 2015, CRP has prevented more than 9 billion tons of soil from eroding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=FSA employees|title=Conservation Reserve Program|url=http://www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/FactSheets/archived-fact-sheets/consv_reserve_program.pdf|website=USDA-Farm Service Agency|publisher=Farm Service Agency|accessdate=14 April 2016|format=PDF|date=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water quality===

One of the most important benefits provided by CRP is the improvement of water quality due to the reduction of erosion and runoff reaching water bodies. The more common runoff materials from agricultural lands included chemical fertilizers, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediments which all have the potential to alter the environmental health of water bodies. Filter strips and buffer strips along the edge of agriculture fields can intercept the runoff materials and keep them from leaving the field. The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) estimated 278 million pounds less nitrogen and 59 million pounds less phosphorus left fields in 2007 due to CRP, 95 and 86 percent reductions, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=FSA employees|title=Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) Benefits: Water Quality, Soil Productivity and Wildlife Estimates|url=https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/crpbennies.pdf|publisher=Farm Service Agency|accessdate=14 April 2016|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife benefits==

CRP also benefits wildlife, most notably, [[bird]]s. The most visible increase in bird population has occurred for native birds such as the Prairie Pothole Duck, [[Redhead (duck)]], [[Sage grouse]], grassland birds, and a non-native migratory species, the [[ring-necked pheasant]]s:
*The [[duck]]s in the [[Prairie Pothole Region]] have seen a 30-percent increase in population since 1992;
*The introduction of CRP in sage grouse territory has slowed the decline of these birds by 25 percent between 1970 and 1988; and
*Studies have estimated that without the influx of CRP lands, [[grassland]] bird populations in the Prairie Pothole region might have declined anywhere from 2 to 52 percent [12].
*Research has shown that a four-percent increase in CRP lands in prime pheasant regions has led to a 22-percent increase in ring-necked pheasant populations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="842">'''Direct electric action''' is one of various systems used in [[pipe organs]]  to control the flow of air (wind) into the organ's pipes when the corresponding keys or pedals are depressed. In direct electric action, the valves beneath the pipes are opened directly by [[electro-magnet]] [[solenoid]]s, while with [[electro-pneumatic action]], the electro-magnet's action admits air into a pneumatic or small bellows which in turn operates the pipe's valve.

Other types of actions used in pipe organs are [[tracker action]], using mechanical linkage of rods and levers, and [[tubular-pneumatic action]] which utilizes a change of pressure within lead tubing which connects the key to the valve pneumatic.

'''Document modelling''' looks at the inherent structure in [[document]]s. It looks not at the structure in formatting which is the classic realm of [[word-processing]] tools, but at the structure in content. Because document content is typically viewed as the ''ad hoc'' result of a creative process, the art of document modelling is still in its infancy. Most document modelling comes in the form of document [[template (file format)|template]]s evidenced most often as word-processing documents, fillable [[PDF]] forms, and [[XML]] templates. The particular strength of XML in this context is its ability to model document components in a tree-like structure, and its separation of content and style.

Document modelling goes beyond mere form-filling and mail-merge to look at the structure of information in, for example, a legal document, a contract, an inspection report, or some form of analysis.

Document modelling therefore looks at the structures and patterns of the written work, and breaks it down into different options or branches. It then labels the branches and the results.  Without effective document modelling, it is difficult to get full value from a [[document automation]] initiative, for example, using document assembly software. But by using a model that contains hundreds and thousands of branches, a user can create close to infinite structured variations almost to the point that such systems can rival the unstructured drafting of a specialist. In fact, the results of a sophisticated document model can surpass those of the specialist in terms of lack of error and consistency of prose.

'''dormakaba Holding AG''' (trading as '''dormakaba''') is a global security group based in [[Rümlang]], [[Switzerland]], and employs around 16,000 staff in over 60 countries. It formed as the result of a merger between Kaba Group and [[Dorma]] in September 2015&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dorma.com/us/en/news-events/press-releases/09.02.2015-merger-between-dorma-and-kaba-to-form-the-dorma-kaba-group-is-completed.html&lt;/ref&gt; and is publicly traded on the [[Swiss Exchange|SIX Swiss Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.six-swiss-exchange.com/shares/security_info_en.html?id=CH0011795959CHF4 |title= SIX Swiss Exchange - Dormakaba Holding AG |publisher=SIX Swiss Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The company was founded in 1862 in Zurich by Franz Bauer as a locksmith shop and cash register factory. The firm was sold in 1915 to Leo Bodmer, who renamed the company to Bauer AG. In 1934, the inventor Fritz Schori created the first cylinder lock with reversible key. Bauer AG patented the invention and named the lock after the firm's founder Franz Bauer, known in German as ''''Ka'''ssen'''ba'''uer' (maker of cash registers) – in short 'Kaba'.

Over the years, the company gradually expanded its portfolio and established itself throughout Europe.  In 1995, Bauer Holding AG was renamed Kaba Holding AG and the company's shares were listed on the Zurich stock exchange.

With the takeover of [[Unican Security Systems]] (Montreal) in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2000/12/22/kaba001222.html |title= Takeover of Unican Security Systems Ltd. |publisher=CBC News | date=December 22, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaba gained a foothold in North America and added the Silca, Ilco and Kaba Mas brands as part of the merger

In 2006, the company acquired the Wah Yuet Group in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601089&amp;sid=arcpM88xs4Sc&amp;refer=china |title= Kaba in China |publisher=Bloomberg | date=November 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the US company Computerized Security Systems (CSS) with its Saflok and La Gard brands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2006/08/28/afx2976115.html |title= Kaba acquires Computerized Security Systems |publisher=AFX News Limited | date=August 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dutch company H. Cillekens Zn. B.V. In addition, various joint ventures with the Indian Minda Group were entered.

At Security 2008, Kaba was awarded the “Security Innovation Award” in gold for its newly developed identification technology RCID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kaba.com/media/104740/v6/File/09-10-08-kaba-wins-security-innovation-award.pdf |title= Media release - Kaba wins Security Innovation Award |publisher=Kaba Holding AG | date=October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pressebox.com/pressreleases/kaba-gmbh/boxid/208435 |title= Kaba gewinnt SECURITY INNOVATION AWARD in Gold |publisher=PRESSEBOX | date=October 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Kaba sold the Business Segment Door Automation (Kaba Gilgen AG, formerly Gilgen AG) to the Japanese [[:ja:ナブテスコ|Nabtesco]] Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/6268.T/key-developments/article/2125883 |title= Nabtesco Corporation Acquires Kaba Gilgen AG |publisher=Reuters | date=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Kaba announced a merger with German-based [[Dorma|Dorma Holding]]. The new company is styled '''dormakaba''' and will be operationally based in [[Rümlang]], [[Switzerland]] where the headquarters of Kaba Group are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/30/kaba-ma-dorma-idUSL5N0XR1NR20150430 |title=Swiss-based Kaba to merge with Germany's Dorma Holding |publisher=Reuters | date=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Dormakaba announced their new Quantum&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Pixel electronic door lock at [https://www.hftp.org/hitec/ HITEC 2017] which is the world's largest hospitality technology event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4083315.html|title=Dormakaba Launches Quantum Pixel, the next generation of Quantum Locks at HITEC|last=Net|first=Hospitality|website=Hospitality Net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of operation ==
The Kaba Group produces components and systems for securing and organizing access as well as for recording enterprise and personnel data. The company operates with four business segments - Access + Data Systems EMEA/AP, Access + Data Systems Americas, Industrial Locks and Key Systems - providing the following groups of products:

* [[Cylinder lock|Cylinders]] and [[Lock (security device)|locks]]

'''Ente Nazionale Italiano di Unificazione'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UNI - ENTE ITALIANO DI NORMAZIONE - UNI - ENTE ITALIANO DI NORMAZIONE|url = http://uni.com|website = uni.com|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Italian National Unification, acronym UNI) is a private non-profit association that performs regulatory activities in Italy across industrial, commercial, and service sectors, with the exception of electrical engineering and electronic competence of CEI .

The UNI is recognized by the Italian State and by the European Union, and represents Italian legislative activity at the [[International Standards Organization]] (ISO) and [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN).

Piero Torretta is the president of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = La governance - UNI - ENTE ITALIANO DI NORMAZIONE|url = http://www.uni.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1618&amp;Itemid=2423|website = www.uni.com|accessdate = 2015-07-14|first = Simona|last = Pauletti}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
The UNI was formed in 1921 with the initials "UNIM" in the face of demands for standardization of mechanical engineering at the time. At the 1928 [[General Confederation of Italian Industry]] (Confindustria) it was promoted to include all sectors of industry, becoming the current UNI.

==Description==
The main tasks of UNI are:

* develop new standards in collaboration with all stakeholders;
* represent Italy in standardization activities internationally (ISO) and within Europe (CEN) in order to promote the harmonization of standards;
* publish and disseminate technical standards and editorial products related to them.

The UNI also avails of federated entities for specific fields of competence. Between them in the field of standardization in the field of computer science is relevant UNINFO, which is the UNI, the areas of competence, at the ISO, the ISO / IEC JTC1 (ISO / IEC Joint Technical Committee) and the CEN.

Other federated entity UNI is the CTI, Italian Committee thermo energy and environment, which deals with the legislative activity in the areas of heating technology and the production and utilization of thermal energy, both nationally and internationally, where he, on behalf of UNI, the work of numerous groups CEN and ISO detaining, for some of these, the relative answering techniques.

The most important federated entity UNI is today the Italian Gas Committee (CIG) that deals with regulation of the sector gas, nationally and internationally and cooperates with many Italian and European institutions in the same sector. Currently this committee is working on several initiatives with strong impact on national energy issues, such as the introduction of biomethane in transport networks and distribution of natural gas, the European project on the quality of gas, the project of smart meters for natural gas.

The published standards can significantly affect the safety of workers, the public, or the environment, that the government refer to them recalling them in documents legislative and attributing to them some level of cogency.

==UNI standard designation==
The designation of a UNI [[Technical standard|standard]] shows its origin (# denotes a number):
* ''UNI #'' is used for Italian standards with primarily domestic significance or designed as a first step toward international status. 
*''UNI EN #'' is used for the Italian edition of European standards.
*''UNI ISO #'' is used for the Italian edition of ISO standards.
*''UNI EN ISO #'' is used if the standard has also been adopted as a European standard.

'''Flow blue''' (occasionally 'flown blue') is a style of white earthenware, sometimes [[porcelain]], that originated in the [[Regency era]], sometime in the 1820s, among the [[The Potteries|Staffordshire]] potters of [[England]].  The name is derived from the blue glaze that blurred or "flowed" during the firing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.antiquesjournal.com/pages04/archives/flowblue.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126154118/http://antiquesjournal.com/Pages04/archives/flowblue.html |archive-date=2010-11-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most flow blue ware is a kind of [[transferware]], where the decorative patterns were applied with a paper stencil to often white-glazed ''blanks'', or standard pottery shapes, though some wares were hand painted.  The stencils burned away in the kiln.  The blue glazes used in flow blue range from gray-blue to sometimes greenish blue, to an inky blue; however the most desirable and sought-after shade is a vivid [[cobalt]] blue.  '''Mulberry''' is another form of flow blue, where the glaze is more purple in hue.

== Concept ==
Fog computing can be perceived both in large cloud systems and [[big data]] structures, making reference to the growing difficulties in accessing information objectively. This results in a lack of quality of the obtained content. The effects of fog computing on cloud computing and big data systems may vary. However, a common aspect is a limitation in accurate content distribution, an issue that has been tackled with the creation of metrics that attempt to improve accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.thinkmind.org/index.php?view=article&amp;articleid=mesh_2013_2_20_40038|title = XMPP Distributed Topology as a Potential Solution for Fog Computing|last = Bar-Magen Numhauser|first = Jonathan|date = August 25, 2013|journal = MESH 2013 The Sixth International Conference on Advances in Mesh Networks|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fog networking consists of a [[control plane]] and a [[data plane]]. For example, on the data plane, fog computing enables computing services to reside at the edge of the network as opposed to servers in a data-center. Compared to [[cloud computing]], fog computing emphasizes proximity to end-users and client objectives, dense geographical distribution and local resource pooling, latency reduction and backbone bandwidth savings to achieve better [[quality of service]] (QoS)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brogi|first=Antonio|last2=Forti|first2=Stefano|date=2017|title=QoS-aware Deployment of IoT Applications Through the Fog|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7919155/|journal=IEEE Internet of Things Journal|volume=PP|issue=99|pages=1–1|doi=10.1109/JIOT.2017.2701408|issn=2327-4662}}&lt;/ref&gt; and edge analytics/stream mining, resulting in superior user-experience&lt;ref name="CiscoFog"&gt;Cisco RFP-2013-078.

Fog networking supports the [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) concept, in which most of the devices used by humans on a daily basis will be connected to each other. Examples include phones, wearable health monitoring devices, [[connected vehicle]] and [[augmented reality]] using devices such as the [[Google Glass]].&lt;ref name="iotCisco"&gt;Bonomi, F., Milito, R., Zhu, J., and Addepalli,S.

SPAWAR, a division of the US Navy, is prototyping and testing a scalable, secure Disruption Tolerant Mesh Network to protect strategic military assets, both stationary and mobile. Machine control applications, running on the mesh nodes, "take over", when internet connectivity is lost. Use cases include Internet of Things e.g. smart drone swarms.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://meshdynamics.com/documents/ABSTRACTED-NETWORK-FOR-IOT.pdf].''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ISO/IEC 20248]] provides a method whereby the data of objects identified by [[edge computing]] using Automated Identification Data Carriers [AIDC], a [[barcode]] and/or [[RFID]] tag, can be read, interpreted, verified and made available into the "Fog" and on the "Edge," even when the AIDC tag has moved on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=dupGDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=ISO/IEC+20248+provides+a+method+whereby+the+data+of+objects+identified+by+edge+computing+using+Automated+Identification+Data+Carriers+%5BAIDC%5D,+a+barcode+and/or+RFID+tag,+can+be+read,+interpreted,+verified+and+made+available+into+the+%22Fog%22+and+on+the+%22Edge%22+even+when+the+AIDC+tag+has+moved+on.&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwium9Cp87TXAhUJWRQKHWMYClcQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=AIDC&amp;f=false|title=Mobile Cloud Computing: Foundations and Service Models|last=Huang|first=Dijiang|last2=Wu|first2=Huijun|date=2017-09-08|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=9780128096444|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Eassy like material hidden:
== Motivation ==
There are many factors that make this an interesting paradigm to study.
Each client/edge device in the past several years as become powerful in its capabilities. For instance, the original iPhone had a single core 412&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM processor with 128&amp;nbsp;MB RAM and 8&amp;nbsp;GB storage space. The current iPhone 5S on the other hand carries a dual-core 1.3&amp;nbsp;GHz Apple A7 processor with 1GB RAM, 64 GB storage space and enhanced GPU capabilities. Intel’s mobile chip Atom and Nvidia’s Tegra too promise near similar specifications. The increase in strength and capabilities implies complex functionality such as CPU/GPU intensive gaming, powerful location/context tracking sensors and enhanced storage.

Fog computing can be much more cognitive of end user application experience since it is much “closer” to the data then traditional cloud computing. Due to the rise of encrypted traffic and multipath-TCP in the  core network, the network provider and the cloud service provider are often unable to extract and understand features specific to the users. Fog applications are not as limited since they may often reside on or near the end user, granting it access to raw user data.

The need for fog applications has been brought further into focus by the clear trend towards cell densification in the 5G framework with multiple small base-stations covering shorter areas. Can they act as miniature LTE-cores coordinating with a centralized LTE core serving only those functionalities that cannot be carried out by the edge?

== Architecture ==
The functionality of Fog networking can be studied according to the traditional functional planes

EDD (Edge-driven Data Center): On the data-plane, distributed data centers, mobile CDN, and edge caching are various manifestations of the Fog. And a goal of Fog networking research is to investigate the optimization of resources that are virtualized, pooled, and shared in unpredictable way.
EDC (Edge-driven Control Plane): On the (much less appreciated) control plane and its many functionalities, Fog Networking revisits the role of the edge devices in network architectures as an integral part of the control plane that monitors, measures, and manages the  network.

== Applications ==
While there has been many applications in the past in the world of P2P networks, sensor networks and mobile adhoc networks (MANETs) there are many applications that can be conceived such as:

* Edge caching/BW management at home gateway/small cell (industrial automation)
* Edge analytics and real-time stream-mining
* IoT session management and signaling load optimization
* Client-driven distributed beam-forming/content sharing
* Clients’ idle computing/storage resource pooling
* Cloudlets/Mobile CDN
* FlashLinQ/LTE Direct/WiFi Direct/AirDrop
* Over The Top (OTT) content management
--&gt;

==History==
In 2012, the need to extend cloud computing with fog computing emerged, in order to cope with huge number of IoT devices and big data volumes for real-time low-latency applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonomi|first=Flavio|last2=Milito|first2=Rodolfo|last3=Zhu|first3=Jiang|last4=Addepalli|first4=Sateesh|date=2012-08-17|title=Fog computing and its role in the internet of things|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2342509.2342513|publisher=ACM|pages=13–16|doi=10.1145/2342509.2342513|isbn=9781450315197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Both [[cloud computing]] and fog computing provide storage, applications, and data to end-users. However, fog computing has a closer proximity to end-users and bigger geographical distribution.&lt;ref&gt;F. Bonomi, R. Milito, J. Zhu, and S. Addepalli, "Fog computing and its role in the internet of things," in Proceedings of the First Edition of the MCC Workshop on Mobile Cloud Computing, ser. MCC’12. ACM, 2012, pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloud Computing – the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cloud_computing|title=cloud computing {{!}} Definition of cloud computing in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud Computing can be a heavyweight and dense form of computing power.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Fog computing – a term created by Cisco that refers to extending cloud computing to the edge of an enterprise's network. Also known as Edge Computing or fogging, fog computing facilitates the operation of compute, storage, and networking services between end devices and cloud computing data centers. While edge computing is typically referred to the location where services are instantiated, fog computing implies distribution of the communication, computation, and storage resources and services on or close to devices and systems in the control of end-users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Chiang|date=2016|title=Fog and IoT: An Overview of Research Opportunities|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7498684/|journal= IEEE Internet of Things Journal|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1109/EuCNC.2017.7980667|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ostberg et al.|first=|date=2017|title=Reliable Capacity Provisioning for Distributed Cloud/Edge/Fog Computing Applications|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7980667/|journal=Networks and Communications (EuCNC), 2017 European Conference on|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1109/JIOT.2016.2584538|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fog computing is a medium weight and intermediate level of computing power&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perera|first=Charith|last2=Qin|first2=Yongrui|last3=Estrella|first3=Julio C.|last4=Reiff-Marganiec|first4=Stephan|last5=Vasilakos|first5=Athanasios V.|date=2017-10-09|title=Fog Computing for Sustainable Smart Cities: A Survey|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3101309.3057266|journal=ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR)|volume=50|issue=3|pages=32|doi=10.1145/3057266|issn=0360-0300}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Mist computing]] – a lightweight and rudimentary {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} form of computing power that resides directly within the network fabric at the extreme edge of the network fabric using microcomputers and microcontrollers to feed into Fog Computing nodes and potentially onward towards the Cloud Computing platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Jake|title=Edge Computing: The Cloud, the Fog and the Edge|url=https://www.solid-run.com/edge-computing-cloud-fog-edge/|website=SolidRun|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in March, 2018 released a definition of the Fog computing adopting much of [https://newsroom.cisco.com/feature-content?articleId=1894659 Cisco's commercial terminology] as '''NIST Special Publication 500-325''', ''Fog Computing Conceptual Model'' that defines Fog computing as an horizontal, physical or virtual resource paradigm that resides between smart end-devices and traditional [[cloud computing]] or [[data center]]. This paradigm supports vertically-isolated, latency-sensitive applications by providing ubiquitous, scalable, layered, federated, and distributed computing, storage, and network connectivity.  Thus Fog Computing is most distinguished by distance from the Edge.  Fog Computing is physically and functionally intermediate between Edge nodes and centralized Clouds. Much of the terminology is not defined including key architectural terms like "smart" and the distinction between Fog Computing from Edge Computing does not have generally agreed acceptance.

A '''funnel''' is a tube or pipe that is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, used for guiding liquid or powder into a small opening.

Funnels are usually made of [[stainless steel]], [[aluminium]], [[glass]], or [[plastic]]. The material used in its construction should be sturdy enough to withstand the weight of the substance being transferred, and it should not react with the substance. For this reason, stainless steel or glass are useful in transferring [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], while plastic funnels are useful in the kitchen. Sometimes disposable [[paper]] funnels are used in cases where it would be difficult to adequately clean the funnel afterwards (for example, in adding motor oil to a car). Dropper funnels, also called [[dropping funnels]] or tap funnels, have a [[tap (valve)|tap]] to allow the controlled release of a liquid. A flat funnel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.flatfunnel.com|title= Flat Funnel for Compact Storage in kitchen garage RV to funnel fluids|website= Flat Funnel|access-date= 2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; made of polypropylene, utilises [[living hinge]]s and flexible walls to fold flat.

The term "funnel" may refer to the [[chimney]] or smokestack on a steam [[locomotive]] and commonly refers to [[funnel (ship)|the same on a ship]]. The term ''funnel'' is also applied to other seemingly strange objects like a [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipe]] or a kitchen [[Wastebin|bin]].

==Laboratory funnels==
{{main article|Laboratory funnel}}
&lt;!-- [[File:FilterFunnelApparatus.png|thumb|upright|A Büchner funnel with a sintered glass disc]] --&gt;
There are many different kinds of funnels that have been adapted for specialized applications in the laboratory. [[Filter funnel]]s, [[thistle funnel]]s (shaped like [[thistle]] flowers), and [[dropping funnel]]s have stopcocks which allow the fluids to be added to a flask slowly. For solids, a powder funnel with a wide and short stem is more appropriate as it does not clog easily.

When we use  with [[filter paper]], filter bunnels, [[Büchner funnel|Büchner]] and [[Hirsch funnel]]s can be used to remove fine particles from a liquid in a process called [[filtration]]. For more demanding applications, the filter paper in the latter two may be replaced with a sintered glass frit. [[Separatory funnel]]s are used in [[liquid-liquid extraction]]s. The [[Tullgren funnel]] is used to collect [[arthropod]]s from [[plant litter]] or similar material.&lt;ref name="dicent"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Entomology |year=2011 |publisher=CABI |isbn=184593542X |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IcmCeAjp6cC |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction ===
Glass is the material of choice for laboratory applications due to its inertness compared with metals or plastics. However, plastic funnels made of nonreactive [[polyethylene]] are used for transferring aqueous solutions. Plastic is most often used for powder funnels that do not come into contact with solvent in normal use.

=== Uses ===
* To channel [[liquids]] or fine-grained substances into containers with a small opening. Used for pouring liquids or powder through a small opening and for holding the filter paper in filtration. Used in transferring liquids in small containers.

== Culture ==
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch-Removing the Rocks from the Head-Detail.jpg|thumb|The painting ''[[Cutting the Stone]]'' depicts the extraction, by a man wearing a funnel hat, of the [[stone of madness]]]]

The inverted funnel is a symbol of madness. It appears in many Medieval depictions of the mad; for example, in [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[Ship of Fools (painting)|Ship of Fools]]'' and ''[[Allegory of Gluttony and Lust]]''. The [[Cebuano (language)|Cebuano]] word for inverted funnel is ''[[:ceb:embodo|embodo]]''; such devices are sometimes used as timers.

In popular culture, the [[Tin Woodman]] in [[L. Frank Baum]]'s novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' (and in most dramatizations of it) uses an inverted funnel for a hat, though that is never specifically mentioned in the story—it originated in [[W. W. Denslow]]'s original illustrations for the book.

In the East Coast of the United States, "beer funnel" is another term for "beer bong". "Funneling" a beer involves pouring an entire beer into a funnel attached to a tube, in which a person then consumes the beer via the tube.

In the computing world, a funnel is frequently used as the icon for the [[Filter (software)|filter]] functionality.

'''Geeks Without Bounds''' (informally known as GWOB) is a humanitarian organization of technologists, first responders, policymakers, and volunteers that work towards improving access to communication and technology. With a focus on working with communities that have limited infrastructure due to violence, negligence, or catastrophe, they organize [[hackathon]]s for [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] technology, and help prototype projects intended to turn into long-term initiatives through their [[Seed accelerator|Accelerator]] for [[Humanitarianism|Humanitarian]] Projects.

== Origins ==
Geeks Without Bounds was initially announced on August 19, 2010 at [[Gnomedex]] 10 in [[Seattle, Washington]], and formally launched on October 10, 2010.&lt;ref name="NewEurope"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geeks for the good of humanity &amp;lsqb;INTERVIEW&amp;rsqb; |url=http://www.neurope.eu/article/geeks-good-humanity-interview/ |date=2012-05-09 |work=[[New Europe (newspaper)|''NewEurope'']] |accessdate=2015-08-31 |quote=The Founder of Geeks Without Bounds, Johnny Diggz, talks about how his organization is using innovative minds to create solutions for disasters |first=Alexandros |last=Koronakis}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Johnny "Diggz" Higgins, and Willow Brugh as a [[Fiscal sponsorship|fiscally sponsored]] program of [[The School Factory]]. In 2012, GWOB became a separate entity, fiscally sponsored by [[The School Factory]].

== Organizational structure ==
Geeks Without Bounds is a non-profit organization, and is primarily volunteer driven. Operational activities are coordinated through a six person board of directors which interact directly with sponsors and organizations around the world. They have organized [[hackathon]]s, and networks of supportive [[hackerspace]]s in a variety of cities since 2010, and have partnered with the [[Random Hacks of Kindness]] project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caseorganic.com/blog/2010/10/loqi-me-wins-grand-prize-in-gwoborg-international-open-source-hackathon/ Open Source Hackathon awards, 2010] via Case Organic&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support and sponsors ==
Geeks Without Bounds is fiscally sponsored by Mentor House, an organization based in Tacoma, Washington. GWOB was originally founded as a project of [[The School Factory|School Factory]] and then spun out as its own organization under School Factory's fiscal sponsorship until that organization closed its doors in 2017.

Partners include [[Random Hacks of Kindness]], [[NetHope]], Startup World, and [[SoftLayer]].

Individual event sponsors and partners have included [[Hewlett-Packard]], The Next Web, [[AT&amp;T]], and the [[International Space Apps Challenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Geeks Without Bounds  » Sponsorship, Donations, and Partners|url = http://gwob.org/donate/|website = gwob.org|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizational sponsors, along with donations from individuals, and grants fund the operational activities of Geeks Without Bounds.

In order to maintain transparency in accounting, income and expenses are provided to the public and published online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gwob.org/sponsorship/ Sponsorship and budget], GWOB.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humanitarian oriented activities ==
Much of their work has focused on providing humanitarian aid in areas recovering from natural disasters and similar crises, working with [[Transformative Innovation for Development and Emergency Support|STAR-TIDES]] and [[Crisis camp|Crisis Commons]].  They have an annual application cycle for projects that want to join the Accelerator for Humanitarian Initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gwob.org/rhok/ Accelerator applications and mentorship cycle], GWOB.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hackathons ===
Geeks Without Bounds has organized various humanitarian hackathons.

[[File:Grab bar.jpg|thumb|250px|Grab bar mounted in a bathroom]]
'''Grab bars''' are [[safety]] devices designed to enable a person to maintain balance, lessen fatigue while standing, hold some of their weight while maneuvering, or have something to grab onto in case of a slip or fall. A [[Primary caregiver|caregiver]] may use a grab bar to assist with transferring a patient from one place to another. A worker may use a grab bar to hold on to as he or she climbs, or in case of a fall.

== Construction ==
Grab bars must bear high loads and sudden impacts, and most jurisdictions have building regulations specifying what loads they must bear. They are generally mounted to masonry walls or to the studs of stud walls (which may need to be specially strengthened). They can be mounted through [[drywall]] into a strong wooden [[wall stud]] or other structural member, but not mounted only on the drywall, as it will not bear the users' weight.

Grab bars are made of metal, plastic, fiberglass, and composites. For wet areas such as bathrooms, the material must be waterproof. [[Stainless steel]], [[nylon]]-coated [[mild steel]], epoxy-coated aluminum, [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS plastic]], and even vinyl-coated metal and plastic.

== Accessibility ==
[[File:Waterless urinals grab bars for disabled.jpg|250px|thumb|Waterless [[urinal]]s, one with grab bars for users who have disabilities.]]
Grab bars increase [[accessibility]] and safety for people with a variety of [[disabilities]] or mobility difficulties. Although they are most commonly seen in public handicapped toilet stalls, grab bars are also used in private homes, [[assisted living facilities]], hospitals, and [[nursing homes]]. Grab bars are most commonly installed next to a toilet or in a shower or bath enclosure.

Some grab bars also have a light feature and double as a night light offering up a little more safety at night when using the bathroom.

=== Locations ===
Many jurisdictions have regulations on grab bar placement and floorplans for public bathrooms ([http://www.grabbarspecialists.com/ADA-Requirements.php American ADA], [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/access-to-and-use-of-buildings-approved-document-m British Doc M] regs).

* Grab bars next to a toilet help people using a [[wheelchair]] transfer to the toilet seat and back to the wheelchair. They also assist people who have difficulty sitting down, have balance problems while seated or need help rising from a seated position.
* Used in a shower or bathtub, grab bars help to maintain balance while standing or maneuvering, assist in transferring into and out of the enclosure, and generally help to mitigate slips and falls.
* Floor to ceiling grab bars, or security poles, can be used in the bedroom to help one get out of bed or get up from a chair, or to help [[Primary caregiver|caregivers]] by assisting in transfers.
Grab bars are often used in conjunction with other medical devices to increase safety.  For example, a grab bar added to a shower is frequently used with a shower chair and hand held shower head.  Grab bars installed by a doorway are usually added near a railing.  In addition, grab bars can be placed on any wall where extra support is needed even if it is not the "usual place" they are used.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Grab Bar.png|Grab Bars reduce falls
File:Grabbar.jpg|Grab Bars come in different styles and colors
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Positions ===
Grab bars can be installed in different positions:

* Vertical grab bars may help with balance while standing.
* Horizontal grab bars provide assistance when sitting or rising, or to grab onto in case of a slip or fall.
* Some grab bars can be installed at an angle, depending on the needs of the user and the positioning.  Grab bars installed horizontally offer up the greatest safety and care should be taken when installing them on the angle as this contrary to the ADA Guidelines.  Often this angled installation is easier for people pulling themselves up from a seated position.

There are many considerations when deciding which grab bar to use and how best to install it. Properly securing a grab bar is important so that it doesn't pull out of the wall when pressure is applied to it. Each installation should be properly secured into wall [[blocking (construction)|blocking]] or [[wall stud|studs]] to provide the best support. If no studs are available, specialized [[Molly (fastener)|mollies]] can be used to spread out grab forces across a wider area of the wall.

=== ADA guidelines ===
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] ''Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities'' (ADAAG) defines requirements for installing grab bars in public bathing and toileting facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) |url=http://www.access-board.gov/adaag/html/adaag.htm |publisher=U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) |date=9/1/2002 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514214351/http://www.access-board.gov/adaag/html/adaag.htm |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines are supported by substantial research regarding the best placement of grab bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access-board.gov/research.htm |title=Research |accessdate=2011-05-15 |publisher=United States Access Board |quote=The Board sponsors and coordinates research for use in developing accessibility guidelines and providing technical assistance to the public. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110428/http://www.access-board.gov/research.htm |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a subset of ADA grab bar guidelines:

* The diameter of grab bars should be 1¼ to 1½ inch (32–38&amp;nbsp;mm) (or the shape shall provide an equivalent gripping surface)
* There shall be a 1½ inch (38&amp;nbsp;mm) clearance from the wall.
* Grab bars should not rotate in their fittings.
* The required mounting height is universally 33 to 36 inches (840–910&amp;nbsp;mm) from top of gripping surface of the grab bar to the finish floor. DOJ 2010 ADA standards 609.4. 
* ADA-style grab bars and their mounting devices should withstand more than 250 pounds (1112 N) of force.
* In public toilet stalls, side grab bars must be a minimum of 42 inches long and mounted 12 inches from the rear wall, and rear grab bars must be a minimum of 36 inches long and mounted a maximum of 6 inches from the side wall.

=== Styles ===
While the ADA guidelines provide specifics on the placement of grab bars in public locations, they do not require a specific style. The British Doc M regulations specify a minimum [[visual contrast|contrast]] between bars and background. Many public facilities opt for the cheapest grab bars, which usually have an institutional look.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} However, grab bars are actually available in many styles, finishes and colors. Manufacturers have begun to understand the need to blend in with home decor, offering grab bars that have style and pizazz. For the home, grab bars do not need to be ADA compliant, but those guidelines should be considered. In addition to straight grab bars, there are fold-out bars, those that clamp onto the side of the bathtub, L-shaped, U-shaped and corner grab bars.  Grab bars are also made with built in LED lighting and can come in many different colours.

== In industry and construction ==
[[File:952282 and 287664 in the platform.JPG|thumb|Horizontal and vertical grab bars (white) on the sides of British railroad [[brake van]]s.]]
[[File:Passenger compartment Class 440.jpg|thumb|left|Grab rails on a longer-distance [[commuter rail|commuter train]] catering for mainly seated passengers]]

Grab bars in industry and [[construction]] are found on equipment or above [[fixed ladder]]s where footholds exist but other handholds are lacking. They may be positioned horizontally, vertically, or at an angle.

When using grab bars as safety devices in order to prevent falls, your best choice would be a horizontal bar. Scientific research has found that gripping strength is far greater using a horizontal bar than a vertical bar in a fall situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20196295 |year=2009 |last1=Young |first1=JG |last2=Woolley |first2=C |last3=Armstrong |first3=TJ |last4=Ashton-Miller |first4=JA |title=Hand-handhold coupling: effect of handle shape, orientation, and friction on breakaway strength |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=705–17 |journal=Human factors |doi=10.1177/0018720809355969}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes horizontal grab bars the safest choice.

[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) guidelines describe the requirements for grab bar clearance, diameter and spacing on fixed ladders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=9719&amp;p_table=STANDARDS OSHA Regulations for Fixed Ladders]&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations state that the clearance in the back of grab bars must be at least 4 inches, the diameter similar to the ladder rungs and, when horizontal, grab bars must be spaced by a continuation of the rung spacing. In 2008-2009 alone, the [[USDOL]] [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] reported 241 casualties from ladder falls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.t01.htm Fatal Occupational Injuries by Event or Exposure, 2008-2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Siderail extensions horizontal grab bars may be [[Screw|bolted]] or [[welded]] to fixed ladders.  Grab bars may be mounted to the curb for access to rooftops and rooftop [[Trapdoor|hatches]].

== Guru of the Week ==
From 1997 to 2003, Sutter regularly created C++ programming problems and posted them on the [[Usenet]] newsgroup comp.lang.c++.moderated, under the title ''Guru of the Week''. The problems generally addressed common misconceptions or poorly understood concepts in C++. Sutter later published expanded versions of many of the problems in his first two books, ''Exceptional C++'' and ''More Exceptional C++''. New articles, mostly related to [[C++11]], were published since November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://herbsutter.com/category/c/gotw/ GotW category of the Sutter's blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Free Lunch Is Over ==
"The Free Lunch Is Over" is an article&lt;ref&gt;Sutter, H. 2005. "The free lunch is over: A fundamental turn toward concurrency in software," Dr. Dobb's Journal, 30(3), http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; from Herb Sutter published in 2005. It stated that [[microprocessor]] serial-processing speed is reaching a physical limit, which leads to two main consequences:
* processor manufacturers will focus on products that better support [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]] (such as multi-core processors), and
* software developers will be forced to develop massively [[Thread (computer science)|multithreaded]] programs as a way to better use such processors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6707">A '''hydrogen compressor''' is a device that increases the pressure of [[hydrogen]] by reducing its volume resulting in [[compressed hydrogen]] or [[liquid hydrogen]].

==Compressor vs pump==
Hydrogen compressors are closely related to [[hydrogen pump]]s and [[gas compressor]]s: both increase the pressure on a [[fluid]] and both can transport the fluid through a [[Hydrogen piping|pipe]]. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of hydrogen gas, whereas the main result of a pump raising the pressure of a [[liquid]] is to allow the [[liquid hydrogen]] to be transported elsewhere.

== Types ==

=== Reciprocating piston compressors ===
A proven method to compress Hydrogen is to apply reciprocating piston compressors. Widely used in refineries, they are the backbone of refining crude oil. Reciprocating piston compressors are commonly available as either oil-lubricated or non-lubricated; for high pressure (350 - 700 bar), non-lubricated compressors are preferred to avoid oil contamination of the Hydrogen.  Expert know-how on piston sealing and packing rings can ensure that reciprocating compressors outperform the competing technologies in terms of MTBO (Mean Time Between Overhaul).

=== Ionic liquid piston compressor ===
An [[ionic liquid piston compressor]] is a hydrogen compressor based on an [[ionic liquid]] piston instead of a metal piston as in a piston-metal [[diaphragm compressor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://achema-content2.dechema.de/achema2009_media/Downloads/Presse/05_07_New_developments.pdf New developments in pumps and compressors using Ionic Liquids] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718224406/http://achema-content2.dechema.de/achema2009_media/Downloads/Presse/05_07_New_developments.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrochemical hydrogen compressor===
A multi-stage [[electrochemical hydrogen compressor]] incorporates a series of [[Membrane electrode assembly|membrane-electrode-assemblies]] (MEAs), similar to those used in [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell]]s; this type of compressor has no moving parts and is compact. The electrochemical compressor works similar to a fuel cell, a voltage is applied to the membrane and the resulting electric current pulls hydrogen through the membrane. With electrochemical compression of hydrogen, a pressure of 14500 psi (1000bar or 100MPa) is achieved. A patent is pending claiming an [[exergy efficiency]] of 70 to 80% for pressures up to 10,000 psi or 700 bars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/licensing/ifci/electrochemical-hydrogen-compressor.html Electrochemical hydrogen compressor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612195936/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/licensing/ifci/electrochemical-hydrogen-compressor.html |date=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A single stage electrochemical compression to 800 bar was reported in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fuelcellsworks.com/news/2011/08/23/hyet-hydrogen-efficiency-technologies-bv-achieves-electro-chemical-compression-of-hydrogen-up-to-a-pressure-of-800-bar/ HyET, Hydrogen Efficiency Technologies BV, achieves electro-chemical compression of hydrogen up to a pressure of 800 Bar]&lt;/ref&gt; DOE has supported developments related to developing low cost electrochemical hydrogen compressors for heat pumps with Xergy Inc.[http://www.xergyinc.com]&lt;/ref.&gt;

=== Hydride compressor ===
In a [[hydride compressor]], thermal and pressure properties of a [[hydride]] are used to absorb low-pressure hydrogen gas at ambient temperatures and then release high-pressure hydrogen gas at higher temperatures; the bed of hydride is heated with hot water or an electric coil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/32405b37.pdf Hydride compressor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503100627/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/32405b37.pdf |date=2012-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Piston-metal diaphragm compressor ===
[[Piston]]-metal [[diaphragm compressor]]s are stationary high-pressure compressors, four-staged water-cooled, 11–15&amp;nbsp;kW, 30–50 Nm3/h 40&amp;nbsp;MPa for dispensation of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suction.co.jp/comp/otherComp.html Piston-metal diaphragm compressor]&lt;/ref&gt; Since compression generates heat, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] and more [[Isothermic process|isothermal]].  The default assumption on diaphragm hydrogen compressors is an [[adiabatic]] efficiency of 70%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dscholar.humboldt.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/2148/514/1/Allen_thesis_final.pdf   Efficiency and performance measurement of a pdc single stage diaphragm hydrogen compressor-Pag.32]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Used in [[hydrogen station]]s.

=== Guided rotor compressor ===
The [[guided rotor compressor]] (GRC) is a positive-displacement rotary [[gas compressor|compressor]] based upon an envoluted [[trochoid]] geometry which utilizes a parallel trochoid curve to define its basic compression volume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grcompressor.com/#section2 GRC - Detailed description and defining geometry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/liquefaction_comp_pres_praxair.pdf Hydrogen delivery liquefaction &amp; compression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314052342/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/liquefaction_comp_pres_praxair.pdf |date=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a typical 80 to 85% [[adiabatic]] efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianpurcell.com/UserFiles/File/MechanicalPerformanceFeaturesGRC.doc Mechanical properties]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linear compressor ===
The single-piston [[linear compressor]] uses dynamic counterbalancing, where an auxiliary movable mass is flexibly attached to a movable piston assembly and to the stationary compressor casing using auxiliary mechanical springs with zero vibration export at minimum electrical power and current consumed by the motor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/cryogenics/linearcomp.html Valved linear compressor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903165158/http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/cryogenics/linearcomp.html |date=2009-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in [[cryogenic]]s

'''ISO/IEC 4909:2006''' establishes specifications for [[financial transaction]] cards using track 3 and is intended to permit interchange based on the use of magnetic stripe encoded information. It specifies the data content and physical location of read/write information on track 3 and is to be used in conjunction with the relevant parts of [[ISO/IEC 7811]] and [[ISO/IEC 7812]].

ISO/IEC 4909:2006 recognizes the need for formats of track 3 which can be used independently of, or in conjunction with, track 2 as defined in [[ISO/IEC 7813]]. This approach is intended to permit the greatest degree of flexibility within the financial community in facilitating international interchange.

Using track 3 in conjunction with track 2 is a mode of operation in both on-line and off-line interchange environments. This mode of operation requires that the original encoded data on track 2 be read; the data on track 3 be read; and, if update is required, all the data on track 3 be rewritten.

Independent use of track 3 is an alternative mode of operation permitting both on-line interchange and off-line interchange based on mutual agreement between interested parties. It requires reading only of the data on track 3 and, if update is required, the rewriting of all the data on track 3.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6695">'''LBCAST''' ('''lateral buried [[electrical charge|charge]] accumulator and sensing [[transistor]]''' array) is a type of [[photo sensor]] which the manufacturer claims is simpler and thus smaller and faster than [[CMOS sensor]]s. It was developed over ten years by [[Nikon]], in parallel with other manufacturer's development of CMOS, and resulted in shipping product in 2003.

Both CMOS and LBCAST technologies branched from researchers discussions of "amplifying sensors" as a way to develop an imaging sensor with lower power requirements than the already-existing [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] sensor technology, for use in portable devices such as [[DSLR camera]]s.&lt;ref name="nik_lbcast"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://imaging.nikon.com/products/imaging/technology/scene/07/index.htm| title=LBCAST| publisher=Nikon Corporation| accessdate=December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''From the Nikon Website:'''

: ''"In July 2003, Nikon introduced LBCAST- a completely new type of image sensor, different from CCD and CMOS, that is a high-speed, power-efficient, low-noise device to be installed in Nikon's flagship camera, the D2Hs."''

: ''"... Compared with conventional sensors, it saves more power and achieves less dark noise. (Dark noise is a phenomenon in which randomly spaced bright pixels appear in images due to the heat from the image device during shooting). Also, LBCAST increases image processing speed and improves sensitivity, contrast and color reproduction."''&lt;ref name="nik_lbcast" /&gt;

== Comparison between LBCAST and CMOS photo sensors ==

The main differences between LBCAST and CMOS-based sensors appear to be those given below:&lt;ref name="nik_lbcast" /&gt;

* LBCAST divides the [[photosite]]s to be read out into two channels by [[colour]], [[red]] and [[blue]] photosites—making up 50% of the total number of photosites between them, as in CMOS and CCD colour sensors—accumulate using one read-channel, while green photosites—which make up the other 50% of total pixels, as in CMOS and CCD—accumulate in a dedicated channel.

: This division is to speed reading, and the separation of green pixels, to which the [[human eye]] is [[human vision|most sensitive]], reduces noise artifacts which might otherwise be introduced by residual [[electrical charge]] in the accumulation [[electronic circuit|circuit]]ry, acquired previously from reading a pixel of a different colour.

: Red and blue are significantly less important in human sight, and so presumably a decision was made not to keep separate read channels for the two colours, in order to simplify the circuit design for practical use -- at least in the described version of LBCAST technology.

* Each photosite in LBCAST uses a single [[JFET]] [[transistor]] in place of two [[MOSFET]] transistors used for the separate tasks of photosite read-out selection and signal amplification, in CMOS technology. In total, CMOS uses four transistors per photosite, where LBCAST manages with three.
* Charge to be (re-)distributed between components in the sensor during use are channeled via the LBCAST lower layers, where CMOS channels this charge over the surface layer. This difference is also claimed to reduce the presence of noise artifacts.
* The simpler circuitry required translates into more space for [[light]] to be received, since wiring and opaque masking takes less space.
* The simpler circuitry required translates into fewer layers of material in the [[silicon chip]] meaning that tangential light requires less correction in order to traverse to the depth at which the [[photons]] result in [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]], simplifying the need for [[microlens|lensing]] at each pixel or photosite, and therefore theoretically, attaining greater image uniformity.

== Uses of LBCAST sensors ==

As at end 2006, the [[Nikon D2H]] and the [[Nikon D2Hs|D2Hs]] were the only publicly available cameras known to carry the sensor. Nikon has opted to use CCDs sourced from Sony in most of their low and mid range cameras and used a CMOS sensor in the flagship D2Xs/D2x. The LBCAST sensor in the D2Hs has remained at 4.1MP.

With the advent of the D3, D700 and D300 cameras in 2007 and 2008, all featuring CMOS sensor technology, it is unknown whether LBCAST plays a part in the design of the CMOS sensor of either, since Nikon's implementation of LBCAST is an adaptation of CMOS, and it is therefore technically correct to refer to the known instances of LBCAST as CMOS, Nikon has not been forthcoming to requests for specific information on the D3 sensor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bythom.com/D3QA.htm| title=Answers to Nikon D3 Questions| first=Thom| last=Hogan| date=April 9, 2007| accessdate=December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nikon have claimed in the past that LBCAST would be further developed.&lt;ref name="nik_lbcast" /&gt;

== Criticisms of LBCAST sensors ==

The following weaknesses have been cited as affecting the Nikon D2H, although whether these issues have origins specific to LBCAST, and whether LBCAST necessitates these problems, is not known.

* [[Colour cast]]—generally (and by definition) [[colour correction]] is a fundamental requirement of imaging in any medium where incident light quality is variable, including unaided human vision, and so this possibly a software issue.&lt;ref name="l_cham"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://diglloyd.com/diglloyd/free/Infrared/InfraredContamination/InfraredContamination.html| title=Infrared Contamination: Good Color Gone Bad| first=Lloyd| last=Chambers| date=November 11, 2006| accessdate=December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Infra-red]] pollution—incident infra-red light is usually filtered on [[image sensors]], using a specific thin film dedicated to this task (but which may serve an additional purpose in protecting the relatively much more expensive sensor component from contamination and damage), and so this issue, if truly the result of ir pollution, may be a problem which is independent of the LBCAST technology of the sensor.&lt;ref name="l_cham" /&gt;
* [[Low resolution]]—it is not known whether the relatively low resolution of the D2H and D2Hs in comparison with other professional cameras of the day is a technological limitation of LBCAST, a [[business management]] or [[marketing]] decision, or whether it has other causes such as gradual ramping-up of manufacturing capability of a new technology by Nikon, who did not appear previously to have the capacity to have novel sensors manufactured to their specification. It is known that there is a market for high-speed, power efficient cameras where higher resolution is not required, for example [[Photojournalism|newspaper journalism]].

Laminar flame speed is given the symbol ''s''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.  According to the thermal flame theory of [[Ernest-François Mallard|Mallard]] and [[Henry Louis Le Chatelier|Le Chatelier]], the un-stretched laminar flame speed is dependent on only three properties of a chemical mixture: the [[thermal diffusivity]] of the mixture, the [[reaction rate]] of the mixture and the temperature through the flame zone:

&lt;math&gt;
s_\mathrm{L}^{\circ} = \sqrt{\alpha \dot{\omega} \left( \dfrac{T_\mathrm{b} - T_\mathrm{i}}{T_\mathrm{i} - T_\mathrm{u}} \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is [[thermal diffusivity]],

&lt;math&gt; \dot{\omega} &lt;/math&gt; is reaction rate,

and the temperature subscript '''u''' is for unburned, '''b''' is for burned and '''i''' is for ignition temperature.

Laminar flame speed is a property of the mixture (fuel structure, stoichiometry) and thermodynamic conditions upon mixture ignition (pressure, temperature). Turbulent flame speed is a function of the aforementioned parameters, but also heavily depends on the flow field. As flow velocity increases and [[turbulence]] is introduced, a flame will begin to wrinkle, then corrugate and eventually the flame front will be broken and transport properties will be enhanced by turbulent [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] in the flame zone. As a result, the flame front of a turbulent flame will propagate at a speed that is not only a function of the mixture's chemical and transport properties but also properties of the flow and turbulence.

'''LonTalk''' is a protocol optimized for control.  Originally developed by [[Echelon Corporation]] for networking devices over media such as [[twisted pair]], [[Power line communication|powerline]]s, [[fiber optics]], and [[radio frequency|RF]]. It is popular for the automation of various functions in industrial control, [[home automation]], transportation, and buildings systems such as [[lighting]] and [[HVAC]]; see [[Intelligent building]], the protocol has now been adopted as an open international control networking standard in the ISO/IEC 14908&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=60203 ISO/IEC 14908-1&lt;/ref&gt; family of standards.  Published through ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 6, this standard specifies a multi-purpose control network protocol stack optimized for smart grid, smart building, and smart city applications..

==LonWorks==
LonTalk is part of the technology platform called '''[[LonWorks]]'''.

==Protocol==
The protocol is defined by ISO/IEC 14908.1 and published by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 6.  The LonTalk protocol has also been ratified by standards setting bodies in the following industries &amp; regions:

* [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Standard ANSI/CEA 709.1 - Control networking (US)
* EN 14908 - Building controls (EU)
* GB/Z 20177.1-2006 - Control networking and building controls (China)
* [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] 1473-L - Train controls (US)
* SEMI E54 - Semiconductor manufacturing equipment sensors &amp; actuators (US)
* IFSF - International forecourt standard for EU petrol stations
* [[Open smart grid protocol|OSGP]] - A widely use protocol for smart grid devices built on ISO/IEC 14908.1

The protocol is only available from the official distribution organizations of each regional standards body or in the form of microprocessors manufactured by companies that have ported the standard to their respective chip designs.

==Security==

An April 2015 cryptanalysis paper claims to have found serious security flaws in the OMA Digest algorithm of the Open Smart Grid Protocol, which itself is built on the same EN 14908 foundations as LonTalk.  The authors speculate that "every other LonTalk-derived standard" is similarly vulnerable to the key-recovery attacks described.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Jovanovic and Samuel Neves.

[[Magnetic]] material synthesis and characterization technology continue to improve, allowing for the production of various shapes, sizes, and compositions of magnetic material to be studied and tuned for improved properties.  One of the places which has seen great advancement is in the synthesis of magnetic materials at [[nanometer]] length scales. Pedro Alexandre Lino Silva made 'experimental proof of magnetic vortex'.  [[Nanoparticle]] research has seen a great deal of interest in a number of fields as many phenomena can be explained by what is occurring on the nanoscale, which can be probed more effectively using nanometer sized materials.  One unique type of materials which have seen a recent surge in research interest have been known as "nanoflakes" where they resemble flakes or discs of nanometer thickness and [[micrometer]] dimensions.  Nanomaterials of this shape have seen use in a number of fields including energy storage, as [electrodes] of [[electrochemical]] cells, and in [[cancer]] therapy to kill cancer cells.

'''Makani Power''' is an [[Alameda, California]]-based company that developed [[airborne wind turbines]] with the support of [[Google X]] and the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] office of [[ARPA-E]].  Makani is a leader in the development of airborne wind power extraction systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirsner|first=Scott|title=A generator that’s lighter than air — and relatively light on the wallet|url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2011/04/17/a_generator_thats_lighter_than_air__and_relatively_light_on_the_wallet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Makani was founded in 2006 by [[Saul Griffith]], [[Don Montague]], and Corwin Hardham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company History|url=http://www.makanipower.com/company-history/|publisher=makanipower.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received funding as part of [[Google.org]]'s Renewable Energy cheaper than Coal (RE&lt;C) initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investing in a cleaner energy revolution|url=http://blog.google.org/2007/11/investing-in-cleaner-energy-revolution.html|publisher=Google.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Makani" is [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] for "wind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wagner|first=Eric|title=High-altitude Wind Power|url=http://conservationmagazine.org/2012/12/high-altitude-wind-power/|work=Conservation|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=13 April 2014|date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the founders, Corwin Hardham, died in 2012 at age 38.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Makani Power’s Corwin Hardham Dies; Service Scheduled |url=http://www.ibabuzz.com/alamedajournal/2012/10/26/service-for-late-makani-power-ceo-scheduled |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222230216/http://www.ibabuzz.com/alamedajournal/2012/10/26/service-for-late-makani-power-ceo-scheduled/ |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 23, 2013, Makani Power was acquired by [[Google]] and was folded into [[Google X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google acquires kite-power generator|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22636565|work=BBC News|date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Working principle ==
In order to meet its goal of producing low-cost renewable energy, the Makani kite-energy system uses autonomous tethered wings which fly in a circular path and generate electricity via wind turbines mounted upon the main wing, a method already in public domain; expert Miles Loyd in 1980 stated that for large scale purposes flying the generators was expected to be disfavored because of the need to fly the mass of the generators;&lt;ref&gt;Miles Loyd, 1980: http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~highwind/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Loyd1980.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; many of Makani Power competitors have generators kept on the ground, like [[KiteGen]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;AWES Museum http://www.energykitesystems.net/AWESMuseum/index.html   ||  KiteGen  http://kitegen.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The electricity is transmitted to the ground via an electrical cable within the kite's tether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Ben|title=Start-ups are devising kites to turn wind power into a cheap source of power|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/start-ups-are-devising-kites-to-turn-wind-power-into-a-cheap-source-of-power/2011/03/14/AB13377_story.html|accessdate=27 July 2011|work=The Washington Post|date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several patent applications have been made; some have been granted.

== Development milestones ==
In December 2016, Makani operated for the first time a 600&amp;nbsp;kW prototype with 28 meter wing span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Makani’s first commercial-scale energy kite|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An8vtD1FDqs|website=YouTube|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Felker|first1=Fort|title=Progress and Challenges in Airborne Wind Energy|url=http://awec2017.com/presentations/fort-felker|conference=Airborne Wind Energy Conference 2017|date=5 October 2017|publisher=University of Freiburg|location=Freiburg, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2013">In mechanics, a '''micromixer''' is a device based on mechanical microparts used to mix [[fluid]]s. This device represents a key technology to fields such as chemical industry, pharmaceutical industry, analytical chemistry, biochemical analysis, and high-throughput synthesis, since it makes use of the miniaturization of the fluids associated in the mixing to reduce quantities involved in the chemical and/or biochemical processes.

==Types and Technology==
There are two types of micromixers: passive and active.

The active ones use an external energy source, which can be electric or magnetic, to perform the mixing of the fluids. In the passive ones, there is no power source employed and basically, pressure guides the flow of fluids.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical Engineering Science 132 (2015) 159–168, Harrison S. Santana&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mäurer &amp; Wirtz''' is a [[Germany|German]] manufacturer of [[personal care products]] and [[perfumes]]. Since 1990 the company has been an independent subsidiary of Dalli Group.&lt;ref name=Frag_M&amp;W&gt;{{cite web|title=Maurer &amp; Wirtz perfumes and colognes|url=http://www.fragrantica.com/designers/Maurer-%26-Wirtz.html|publisher=Fragrantica|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is managed by the fifth generation of the Wirtz family, joint CEO Hermann Wirtz.

The headquarters and production site is in [[Stolberg (Rhineland)|Stolberg]] near the city of [[Aachen]] with 400 employees.&lt;ref name="FAZ"&gt;[http://www.faz.net/artikel/C30563/maeurer-wirtz-baut-um-30379128.html FAZ about Mäurer &amp; Wirtz] on 6 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The company sells a range of consumer products using the sales divisions Cosmeurop Perfumes, Théany Cosmetics, [[NewYorker]] Cosmetics, [[s.Oliver]] Cosmetics and comma Cosmetics. Besides its own brands, such as Betty Barclay and [[4711]], the company produces licensed brands, such as [[s.Oliver]] and Otto Kern.&lt;ref name="CB"&gt;[http://www.cosmetic-business.com/showartikel.php?art_id=2377  Mäurer &amp; Wirtz at www.cosmetic-business.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527033806/http://www.cosmetic-business.com/showartikel.php?art_id=2377 |date=2012-05-27 }} on 6 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main markets are Germany, [[Benelux]], Austria, Switzerland and exports to 135 countries. The company's products are distributed and sold through [[perfumery]] and drugstore retailers, [[department store]]s, [[drug store]]s and selected supermarkets.

== History ==
The history of the [[family business]] goes back to Michael Mäurer and his stepson Andreas August Wirtz, who established a soapworks in 1845 in Stolberg. Initially, only soft soaps, curd soaps and fine soaps were sold in a grocery store for the local market. Over time, the products were established in the Rhineland and later also in neighboring countries (mainly France and [[Benelux]]). In 1884 the production of [[washing powder]] began and then around the turn of the century the company's first trademarks were registered. Mäurer &amp; Wirtz now produces detergents, soap products, perfumes and cosmetics.&lt;ref name="Geschichte"&gt;[http://www.m-w.de/stolberg.html History at www.m-w.de]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} on 6. July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1992, products under the ''Betty Barclay'' brand have also been produced under license. In 2007, the company took over the brands ''[[4711]]'', ''Tosca'', ''Sir Irisch Moos'' and ''Extase'' from [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], and in 2011 the ''[[Baldessarini]]'' fragrance line, and ''Windsor'' were acquired.

== Products ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8210">The terms '''hold-in range''', '''pull-in range''' (acquisition range), and '''lock-in range''' are widely used by engineers for the concepts of frequency deviation ranges within which [[phase-locked loop]]-based circuits can achieve lock under various additional conditions.

==History==
In the classic books on [[phase-locked loop]]s,&lt;ref name=gardner1966&gt;{{cite book
 | author = F. Gardner
 | year = 1966
 | title = Phase-lock techniques.
 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons
 | location = New York
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author = A. Viterbi
 | year = 1966
 | title = Principles of coherent communications.
 | publisher = McGraw-Hill
 | location = New York
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1966, such concepts as hold-in, pull-in, lock-in, and other frequency ranges for which PLL can achieve lock, were introduced. They are widely used nowadays (see, e.g. contemporary engineering literature&lt;ref name=gardner2005&gt;{{cite book
 | author = F. Gardner
 | year = 2005
 | title = Phase-lock techniques, 3rd ed
 | publisher = Wiley
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=best2007&gt;{{cite book
 | author = R. Best
 | year = 2007
 | title = Phase-Lock Loops: Design, Simulation and Application, 6th ed.
 | publisher = McGraw-Hill
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other publications). Usually in engineering literature only non-strict definitions are given for these concepts. F. Gardner in 1979 in the 2nd edition of his well-known work, Phaselock Techniques, formulated the following problem&lt;ref name=gardner1979&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Floyd|title=Phase-lock techniques, 2nd ed.|date=1979|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;[p.&amp;nbsp;70] (see also the 3rd edition&lt;ref name="gardner2005" /&gt;[p.&amp;nbsp;187–188]): "There is no natural way to define exactly any unique lock-in frequency". The lack of rigorous explanations led to the paradox: "despite its vague reality, lock-in range is a useful concept"&lt;ref name=gardner1979 /&gt;[p.&amp;nbsp;70]. Many years of using definitions based on the above concepts has led to the advice given in a handbook on synchronization and communications, namely to check the definitions carefully before using them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Definitions==
* &lt;math&gt;\theta_\Delta(t) = \theta_\text{ref}(t) - \theta_\text{VCO}(t)&lt;/math&gt;   phase difference between input (reference) signal and local oscillator (VCO, NCO) signal.
* &lt;math&gt;\theta_\Delta(0)&lt;/math&gt;   initial phase difference between input signal and VCO signal.
* &lt;math&gt;\omega_\Delta(t) = \dot\theta_\text{ref}(t) - \dot\theta_\text{VCO}(t)&lt;/math&gt; frequency difference between input signal frequency and VCO signal.
* &lt;math&gt;\omega_\Delta^\text{free} = \omega_\text{ref} - \omega_\text{VCO}^\text{free}&lt;/math&gt; frequency difference between input signal frequency and VCO free running frequency.

Note that in general &lt;math&gt;\omega_\Delta^\text{free} \neq \omega_\Delta(0)&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;\omega_\Delta(0)&lt;/math&gt; also depends on initial input of VCO.

=== Locked state ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Definition of locked state'''

In a locked state: 1) the phase error fluctuations are small, the frequency error is small; 2) PLL approaches the same locked state after small perturbations of the phases and filter state.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hold-in range ===
[[File:Hold-in-expl2 5.svg|center|thumb|512x512px|Hold-in range. Free-running frequency of VCO is fixed and input signal frequency is slowly-changing. While ω ref is inside hold-in range, VCO frequency is in tune with it, which is called tracking. Outside hold-in range VCO may unlock from input signal.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Definition of hold-in range.'''

A largest interval of frequency deviations &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \left|\omega_\Delta^\text{free}\right| \leq \omega_h&lt;/math&gt; for which a locked state exists is called a '''hold-in range''', and &lt;math&gt;\omega_h&lt;/math&gt; is called hold-in frequency.&lt;ref name=Leonov2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonov2015-2 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Value of frequency deviation belongs to the hold-in range if the loop re-achieves locked state after small perturbations of the filter's state, the phases and frequencies of VCO and the input signals. This effect is also called [[Lyapunov stability#Definition for continuous-time systems|steady-state stability]]. In addition, for a frequency deviation within the hold-in range, after a small changes in input frequency loop re-achieves a new locked state (tracking process).

=== Pull-in range ===
Also called acquisition range, capture range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author = B. Razavi
 | year = 1996
 | title = Design of Monolithic Phase-Locked Loops and Clock Recovery Circuits-A Tutorial.
 | publisher = IEEE Press
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assume that the loop power supply is initially switched off and then at &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt; the power is switched on, and assume that the initial frequency difference is sufficiently large. The loop may not lock within one beat note, but the VCO frequency will be slowly tuned toward the reference frequency (acquisition process). This effect is also called a transient stability. The pull-in range is used to name such frequency deviations that make the acquisition process possible (see, e.g. explanations in [,&lt;ref name=gardner1966 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;40], [,&lt;ref name=best2007 /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;61]).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Definition of pull-in range.'''

'''Pull-in range''' is a largest interval of frequency deviations &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \left|\omega_\Delta^\text{free}\right| \leq \omega_p&lt;/math&gt; such that PLL acquires lock for arbitrary initial phase, initial frequency, and filter state. Here &lt;math&gt;\omega_p&lt;/math&gt; is called pull-in frequency.&lt;ref name=Leonov2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonov2015-2 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Lock-in range ===
Assume that PLL is initially locked. Then the reference frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; is suddenly changed in an abrupt manner(step change). Pull-in range guarantees that PLL will eventually synchronize, however this process may take a long time. Such long acquisition process is called cycle slipping.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If difference between initial and final phase deviation is larger than &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, we say that '''cycle slipping''' takes place.
:&lt;math&gt; \exist t &gt; T_\text{lock}: \left|\theta_\Delta(0) - \theta_\Delta(t)\right| \geq 2\pi.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, sometimes, the limit of the difference or the maximum of the difference is considered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Definition of lock-in range.'''

If the loop is in a locked state, then after an abrupt change of &lt;math&gt;\omega_\Delta^\text{free}&lt;/math&gt; free within a '''lock-in range''' &lt;math&gt;\left|\omega_\Delta^\text{free}\right| \leq \omega_l&lt;/math&gt;, the PLL acquires lock without cycle slipping. Here &lt;math&gt;\omega_l&lt;/math&gt; is called lock-in frequency.&lt;ref name=Leonov2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonov2015-2 /&gt;

==Developers and consumers==
Many platforms have only two sides: one of [[consumer]]s and the other of independent ([http://www.sp.se/EN/PRESS/GLOSSARY/Sidor/default.aspx third-party]) developers. Independent developers produce and sell [[complementary goods]], also called "platform applications," directly to the platform's consumers. These applications rely on the platform's services to function. Generally speaking, consumers prefer a platform with more and higher-value applications, while developers prefer a platform with more and higher-paying consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Functions==
Platform evangelism establishes and nurtures a platform ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which requires five simultaneous activities: 1) sales, 2) enablement, 3) feedback, 4) intelligence, and 5) regulation.

===Ecosystem sales===
[[Sales|Ecosystem sales]] is the attempt to convince third parties to develop [[complementary goods]] for the platform's commercial ecosystem. The characteristics of successful platform evangelists&lt;ref name="Conwell"&gt;{{cite web
|first=Frederic |last=Lucas-Conwell

|accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; are essentially identical, including deep product knowledge, [[empathy]], [[humor]], [[integrity]], [[communication]] skills, positive attitude, infectious [[enthusiasm]], a sincere desire to help others, etc. The primary difference is in "hunger for money" among salespersons.&lt;ref name=salespersons /&gt; This is unlikely to be satisfied by technology evangelism, which is more likely to be a [[Cost center (business)|cost center]] than a [[profit center]], and hence incapable of paying sales-like [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]].

====Developer enablement resources====
This aspect of platform evangelism can be seen as vendor-sponsored change agency in the [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion of an innovation]] (the platform). As such, platform evangelism is responsible for creating the resources that enable developers to progress swiftly through  the [[Diffusion of innovations#Five stages of the adoption process|innovation adoption process]] ("developer enablement resources").

Each different phase of the [[Diffusion of Innovations#Mechanism|platform adoption process]] requires different developer enablement resources. It is the responsibility of the platform evangelist to ensure that each developer enablement resource comes into existence in a timely manner.

===Ecosystem feedback===
Because developers will often choose an inferior platform if its rate of improvement suggests that it will soon become the superior platform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |last        = Plamondon

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; even the superior platform must improve rapidly. To facilitate this rapid improvement, platform evangelism organizes and champions the feedback of ecosystem developers within the platform vendor.

===Ecosystem intelligence===
Ecosystem [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] gathers information about the activities and intentions of other platform vendors from sources in and around the developer ecosystem.

===Ecosystem regulation===
To avoid the [[market failure]] of multi-sided platforms,&lt;ref name="Stupidity"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; platform evangelism will often engage in ''[[de facto]]'' regulation of the commercial ecosystem that surrounds its platform.&lt;ref name=Boudreau2008/&gt; Such regulation combines legal, technological, informational, and other instruments (along with price setting) to minimize the costs of [[Externality|externalities]], complexity, uncertainty, [[information asymmetry]], and [[Coordination game|coordination problems]].

==Platform competition and platform evangelism==
Often, many [[competition (economics)|competing]] [[two-sided market|two-sided platforms]]―each offering roughly the same benefits on the developer side―start [[diffusion of innovations|diffusing]] through a [[Market (economics)|market]] at approximately the same time.&lt;ref name=Armstrong&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-fulfilling prophecy ==
If it is expensive to re-develop an application to target a second (or third) platform, then developers will tend to adopt, first, the platform which they believe has the highest [[Rate of return|lifetime profit opportunity]]. This tends to become a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], in which the platform which is initially perceived to have the highest [[Rate of return|lifetime profit opportunity]] tends to accumulate the most applications, which then makes it more attractive to consumers, which makes it more attractive to developers, etc., in a [[virtuous cycle]], until a [[critical mass]] (also known as a [[Tipping point (sociology)|tipping point]]) is reached, such that it out-competes the other platforms…and eventually does indeed come to offer the highest lifetime profit potential, as prophesied. This makes it very important for a platform vendor to convince developers ''from the outset'', even before the platform becomes commercially available to consumers,&lt;ref name=Armstrong /&gt; that its platform will have the highest lifetime profit potential. This contributes to the [[high tech|high-tech]] industry's [[hype cycle]].

==Network effects, path dependence, and ''de facto'' standards==
If the market has strong [[network effects]], then those platforms which gain the fewest early adopters may cease to exist, making them unavailable to later potential adopters. This is [[path dependence]].&lt;ref name="Arthur"&gt;{{cite book
|first=Brian W. |last=Arthur
|title=Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy
|year=1994
|publisher=University of Michigan Press
|isbn=0-472-09496-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the number of reasonable platform choices in a market falls to 1, then that "only reasonable choice" becomes the market's [[de facto standard|''de facto'' standard]] (also known as its [[Dominant Design]]) by definition.

==Switching costs, lock-in, and profitability==
If the [[switching cost|cost of switching]] away from a ''de facto'' standard to a new alternative exceeds the benefit gained by the earliest market participants who make that switch, then the market will tend to become [[vendor lock-in|locked into]] the ''de facto'' standard, with its [[market share]] approaching 100%.&lt;ref name=Arthur /&gt; Markets that are highly interconnected are more resistant to change than less interconnected markets.&lt;ref name="SlowPace"&gt;{{cite book

| publisher=Harvard Business School Press
| page=151
| isbn=1-57851-852-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mature share==
Not all markets become locked into a ''de facto'' standard, and indeed, many factors act against such an outcome.&lt;ref name=Weyl&gt;{{cite web

| isbn =0-521-80095-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means to an end==
Therefore, with regard to a two-sided platform's developer side, it is platform evangelism's responsibility to:
* Increase the quantity and quality of the platform's complementary goods;
* Provide potential developers of complementary goods with a compelling opportunity for profit;
* Increase awareness of this opportunity among potential developers of complementary goods;
* Reduce the cost and risk associated with developing complementary goods;
* Increase the percentage of the market's complementary goods that are developed ''first'', ''best'', or ''only'' for its platform;
* Increase the network effects generated by its platform and its complementary goods;
* Increase the platform's switching-out costs, while decreasing its switching-in costs;
* Oppose the efforts of competing vendors to do likewise.

In short, it is platform evangelism's responsibility to design, develop, maintain, and extend the size and health of the platform's ecosystem, such that potential developers will choose to participate ''first'', ''best'', or ''only'' in that ecosystem.

Ultimately, these are all [[Means to an end|means to the end]] of gaining the highest possible [[market share|share]] of the developer side of the targeted market. Whether this is, in turn, a means to the end of maximizing share on the market's consumer side, or ''vice versa'', depends on the platform vendor's [[Two-sided markets#Pricing in Two-Sided Networks|pricing strategy]].
* If the platform vendor profits primarily from the developer side (as [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] does with [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]), then maximizing developer share is the ultimate end.
* If the platform vendor profits primarily from the consumer side (as [[Microsoft]] does with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]), then maximizing developer share is a means to the ultimate end of maximizing consumer share.

==Theory and management==

}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the theory underpinning platform evangelism's regulatory function is likely to be poorly understood by its practitioners—a situation that has contributed to many disastrous market failures.&lt;ref name=Stupidity/&gt;

More generally, evangelizing the developer side of a multi-sided platform can be seen as using social influence to accelerate the diffusion of an innovation, within a dynamic system, in the presence of network effects, for economic gain (to the [[proprietary software|platform vendor]] or to [[free software movement|society as a whole]]). Therefore, a solid understanding of the theory and practice of  [[social influence]], [[diffusion of innovations]], [[system dynamics]], [[Technological innovation system#Dynamics of Technological Innovation Systems|innovation dynamics]], [[network effect]]s, [[innovation economics]], and the [[two-sided market|economics of multi-sided platforms]] is essential to the [[design]] and [[management]] of [[economic efficiency|efficient]] and [[effectiveness|effective]] platform evangelism campaigns.

Most of the theory and practice of platform evangelism, as influenced by these theoretical underpinnings, has yet to be comprehensively documented, and is therefore not available to novice evangelists or their managers. Because the development of expertise in any domain takes considerable time and practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Post-War Building Studies''' are a set of [[technical report]]s published by the British [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] starting in 1944.  The Directorate of Post-War Building was established in 1941 under Sir [[James Grey West|James West]]. The Directorate was charged with coordinating solutions for construction of housing to replace homes that had been destroyed as well as homes that had been deferred due to war. The Directorate reported to the Minister of Works, initially [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]] then later [[Lord Portal]].

A new standard system for wiring homes for electricity was described in report no. 11. The reports had a significant impact on the design and construction of buildings in the UK after the war and continue to be cited as references, though their recommendations on [[fire safety]] were later found to be insufficient as apartment buildings became taller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highrisefire.co.uk/leg.html |title= Building Legislation|last= Fishlock |first= Mark |date=10 March 2013 |website= HIGH-RISE Fire Fighting: Developing better responses to fires in tower bocks and high-rise buildings |publisher=Net-Gen |access-date=17 November 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[BS 1363]] [[power socket]] (another product of the studies) has proved long-lasting and is still in use in British homes today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iconeye.com/opinion/icon-of-the-month/item/12383-the-british-plug |title=Icon of the Month: The British plug|last=Jervis |first=John |date=29 January 2016 |website=ICON |publisher=Iconeye |access-date= 17 November 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Damon |date=25 November 2014 |title=Plugging in: Power sockets, standards and the valencies of national habitus |url=http://eprints.brighton.ac.uk/13388/1/Plugging%20In%20-%20Damon%20Taylor%202014.pdf |journal=Journal of Material Culture |volume=20|issue=1 |pages=1-17 |doi=10.1177/1359183514557765 |access-date= 17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While not made part of mandatory building codes and regulations, the reports provided technical guidance and information on application of non-traditional building techniques and materials while overcoming material and labour shortages.

Based on the experience following World War I, it was expected that housing construction demand would be very high after WWII ended, both due to pent-up demand that had not been fulfilled and also due to replacement or repair of housing that had been bombed during the war. Labour and material were expected to be in short supply.  Interest in industrial methods, pre-fabrication and new materials was high during the period between the wars, and such publications as the ''[[Tudor Walters Report]]'' of 1918 gave details on new methods of construction and new materials, including recommendations to improve construction efficiency by better site organisation, increased accuracy of cost accounting, and keeping building trade workers regularly employed. The Directorate of Post-War Building and the Directorate of Building Materials were established by the Ministry of Works.  These groups took on research into new methods and published the ''Post War Building Studies'' in 33 volumes between 1944 and 1946. Experimental work was carried out at the [[Building Research Establishment|Building Research Station]] and reported in the series.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Wall, ''An Architecture of Parts: Architects, Building Workers and Industrialisation in Britain 1940 - 1970'',	Routledge, 2013 {{ISBN|1135091072}}, pp 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2493">In [[control theory]], a '''proper transfer function''' is a [[transfer function]] in which the [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] of the numerator does not exceed the degree of the denominator. 

A '''strictly proper''' [[transfer function]] is a transfer function where the degree of the numerator is [[less than]] the degree of the denominator.


The difference between the degree of the denominator (number of poles) and degree of the numerator (number of zeros) is the ''relative degree'' of the transfer function.

==Example==
The following transfer function:
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = \frac{\textbf{N}(s)}{\textbf{D}(s)} = \frac{s^{4} + n_{1}s^{3} + n_{2}s^{2} + n_{3}s + n_{4}}{s^{4} + d_{1}s^{3} + d_{2}s^{2} + d_{3}s + d_{4}}&lt;/math&gt;

is '''proper''', because
:&lt;math&gt; \deg(\textbf{N}(s)) = 4 \leq \deg(\textbf{D}(s)) = 4 &lt;/math&gt;.

is '''biproper''', because
:&lt;math&gt; \deg(\textbf{N}(s)) = 4 = \deg(\textbf{D}(s)) = 4 &lt;/math&gt;.

but is '''not strictly proper''', because
:&lt;math&gt; \deg(\textbf{N}(s)) = 4 \nless \deg(\textbf{D}(s)) = 4 &lt;/math&gt;.

The following transfer function is '''not proper''' (or strictly proper)
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = \frac{\textbf{N}(s)}{\textbf{D}(s)} = \frac{s^{4} + n_{1}s^{3} + n_{2}s^{2} + n_{3}s + n_{4}}{d_{1}s^{3} + d_{2}s^{2} + d_{3}s + d_{4}}&lt;/math&gt;
because
:&lt;math&gt; \deg(\textbf{N}(s)) = 4 \nleq \deg(\textbf{D}(s)) = 3 &lt;/math&gt;.

The following transfer function is '''strictly proper'''
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = \frac{\textbf{N}(s)}{\textbf{D}(s)} = \frac{n_{1}s^{3} + n_{2}s^{2} + n_{3}s + n_{4}}{s^{4} + d_{1}s^{3} + d_{2}s^{2} + d_{3}s + d_{4}}&lt;/math&gt;
because
:&lt;math&gt; \deg(\textbf{N}(s)) = 3 &lt; \deg(\textbf{D}(s)) = 4 &lt;/math&gt;.

==Implications==
A proper transfer function will never grow unbounded as the frequency approaches infinity:
:&lt;math&gt; |\textbf{G}(\pm j\infty)| &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;

A strictly proper transfer function will approach zero as the frequency approaches infinity (which is true for all physical processes):
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(\pm j\infty) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Also, the integral of the real part of a strictly proper transfer function is zero.

'''Optoelectronic reciprocity relations''' relate properties of a [[diode]] under illumination to the [[photon]] emission of the same diode under applied [[voltage]]. The relations are useful for interpretation of luminescence based measurements of solar cells and modules and for the analysis of [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]] losses in solar cells.

== Basics ==
[[Solar cell|Solar cells]] and [[Light-emitting diode|light-emitting diodes]] are both [[semiconductor|semiconducting]] [[p–n diode|diodes]] that are operated in a different voltage and illumination regime and that serve different purposes. A solar cell is operated under illumination (usually by solar radiation) and is typically kept at the maximum power point where the product of [[Electric current|current]] and voltage are maximized. A light emitting diode is operated at an applied forward bias (without external illumination). While a solar cell converts the energy contained in the [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] of the incoming [[solar radiation]] into [[electric power]] (voltage x current) a light-emitting diode does the inverse, namely converting electrical power into [[electromagnetic radiation]]. A solar cell and a light emitting diode are typically made from different materials and optimized for different purposes; however, conceptually every solar cell could be operated as a light emitting diode and vice versa. Given that the operation principles have a high symmetry it is fair to assume that the key figures of merit that are used to characterize photovoltaic and luminescent operation of diodes are related to each other. These relations become particularly simple in a situation, where recombination rates scale linearly with minority carrier density and are explained below.

== Reciprocity between the photovoltaic quantum efficiency and the electroluminescence spectrum of a pn-junction diode ==
[[File:OptoRecipScheme01.png|thumb|upright=3|Illustration of the basic underlying principles of the reciprocity relation between photovoltaic quantum efficiency and external luminescence quantum efficiency of a light emitting diode. On the left, the band diagram of a [[p-n junction]] solar cell is depicted with a thin n-type region on the left and a thicker p-type region on the right. Light absorption in the p-type base leads to free electrons that have to be collected by diffusing to the edge of the [[space charge region]] between the n and p-type regions of the diode. On the right, a forward voltage is applied to the same diode. Electron injection will lead to recombination and consequently light emission. The emission spectrum of the luminescence emitted in the situation on the right is directly related to the quantum efficiency of photocurrent in the photovoltaic situation on the left. The relation between the two situations is based on the principle of detailed balance that relates absorption and radiative recombination via the van Roosbroeck-Shockley equation and charge collection and injection via the Donolato theorem.]]

The photovoltaic [[quantum efficiency]] &lt;math&gt;Q_{e,PV}&lt;/math&gt; is a spectral quantity that is generally measured as a function of photon energy (or wavelength). The same is true for the [[electroluminescence]] spectrum &lt;math&gt;\phi_{EL}&lt;/math&gt; of a light emitting diode under applied forward voltage &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Under certain conditions specified below, these two properties measured on the same diode are connected via the equation&lt;ref name="Rau-Reciprocity"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Rau
  | first = U.
  | title = Reciprocity relation between photovoltaic quantum efficiency and electroluminescent emission of solar cells
  | journal = Physical Review B
  | volume = 76
  | pages = 085303
  | date = 2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{EL}=Q_{e,PV}\phi_{bb}[\exp{\frac{qV}{kT}}-1]&lt;/math&gt; (1)
where &lt;math&gt;\phi_{bb}&lt;/math&gt; is the black body spectrum emitted by a surface (the diode) into the hemisphere above the diode in units of photons per area, time and electron interval. In this case the [[Black-body radiation|black body spectrum]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{bb}=\frac{2\pi}{h^3c^2}\frac{E^2}{\exp{E/kT}-1}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the Boltzmann constant, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is Planck’s constant, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light in vacuum, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the diode.
This simple relation is useful for the analysis of solar cells using luminescence-based characterization methods. Luminescence used for characterization of solar cells is useful because of the ability to image the luminescence of solar cells and modules in short periods of times, while spatially resolved measurements of photovoltaic properties (such as photocurrent or photovoltage) would be very time-consuming and technically difficult.

Equation (1) is valid for the practically relevant situation, where the neutral base region of a pn-junction makes up most of the volume of the diode. Typically, the thickness of a crystalline Si solar cell is ~ 200 µm while the thickness of the emitter and space charge region is only on the order of hundreds of nanometers, i.e. three orders of magnitude thinner. In the base of a pn-junction, recombination is typically linear with minority carrier concentration over a large range of injection conditions and charge carrier transport is by [[diffusion]]. In this situation, the Donolato theorem&lt;ref name="Donolato-Reciprocity"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Donolato
  | first = C.
  | title = A reciprocity theorem for charge collection
  | journal = Applied Physics Letters
  | volume = 46
  | pages = 270
  | date = 1985}}
&lt;/ref&gt;. is valid that states that the collection efficiency &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt; is related to the normalized minority carrier concentration &lt;math&gt;\delta n(x)/\delta n(x=x_j)&lt;/math&gt; via
:&lt;math&gt;f_c(x)=\frac{\delta n(x)}{\delta n(x=x_j)}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a spatial coordinate and &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; defines the position of the edge of the space charge region (where the neutral zone and the space charge region connect). Thus, if &lt;math&gt;x=x_j&lt;/math&gt;, the collection efficiency is one. Further away from the edge of the space charge region, the collection efficiency will be smaller than one depending on the distance and the amount of recombination happening in the neutral zone. The same holds for the electron concentration in the dark under applied bias. Here, the electron concentration will also decrease from the edge of the space charge region towards the back contact. This decrease as well as the collection efficiency will be approximately exponential (with the diffusion length controlling the decay). 

The Donolato theorem is based on the principle of [[detailed balance]] and connects the processes of charge carrier injection (relevant in the luminescent mode of operation) and charge carrier extraction (relevant in the photovoltaic mode of operation).
In addition, the detailed balance between absorption of photons and radiative recombination can be mathematically expressed using the van Roosbroeck-Shockley&lt;ref name="vRS"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last1 = van Roosbroeck

&lt;/ref&gt; equation as
:&lt;math&gt;k_{rad}n_i^2=\int\alpha4n_r^2\phi_{bb}dE&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the absorption coefficient, &lt;math&gt;k_{rad}&lt;/math&gt; is the radiative recombination coefficient, &lt;math&gt;n_r&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]],  &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is the intrinsic charge carrier concentration.  
A derivation of equation (1) can be found in ref. &lt;ref name="Rau-Reciprocity"&gt;{{cite journal

  | volume = 76
  | pages = 085303
  | date = 2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The reciprocity relation (eq. (1)) is only valid if absorption and emission is dominated by the neutral region of the pn-junction shown in the adjacent figure.&lt;ref name="Lundstrom-Reciprocity"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
This is a good approximation for [[crystalline silicon]] solar cells and the method can also be used for [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells|Cu(In,Ga)Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; based solar cells]]. However the equations has limitations when applied to solar cells where the [[space charge region]] is of comparable size to the total absorber volume. This is the case for instance for [[organic solar cell|organic solar cells]] or [[amorphous silicon|amorphous Si]] solar cells.&lt;ref name="Kirchartz-Reciprocity"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
The reciprocity relation is also invalid if the emission of the solar cell is not from delocalized conduction and valence band states as would be the case for most mono and polycrystalline semiconductors but from localized states (defect states). This limitation is relevant for microcrystalline and amorphous silicon solar cells.

== Reciprocity between the open-circuit voltage of a solar cell and the external luminescence quantum efficiency ==

The [[open-circuit voltage]] &lt;math&gt;V_{oc}&lt;/math&gt; of a solar cell is the voltage created by a certain amount of illumination if the contacts of the solar cell are not connected, i.e. in open circuit. The voltage that can build up in such as situation is directly connected to the [[charge carrier|density of electrons and holes]] in the device. These densities in turn depend on the rates of [[Carrier generation and recombination|photogeneration (determined by the amount of illumination) and the rates of recombination]]. The rate of photogeneration is usually determined by the typically used illumination with white light with a power density of 100mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (called one sun) and by the [[band gap]] of the solar cell and does not change much between different devices of the same type. The rate of recombination however might vary over orders of magnitude depending on the quality of the material and the interfaces. Thus, the open-circuit voltage depends quite drastically on the rates of recombination at a given concentration of charge carriers. The highest possible open-circuit voltage, the radiative open-circuit voltage &lt;math&gt;V_{oc,rad}&lt;/math&gt;, is obtained if all recombination is radiative and non-radiative recombination is negligible. This is the [[Shockley-Queisser limit|ideal situation]], because radiative recombination cannot be avoided other than by avoiding light absorption (principle of detailed balance). However, since absorption is a key requirement for a solar cell and necessary to achieve a high concentration of electrons and holes as well, radiative recombination is a necessity (see van Roosbroeck-Shockley equation &lt;ref name="vRS"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last1 = van Roosbroeck
  | first1 = W.
  | last2 = Shockley
  | first2 = W.
  | title = Photon-radiative recombination of electrons and holes in germanium
  | journal = Physical Review 
  | volume = 94
  | pages = 1558
  | date = 1954}}
&lt;/ref&gt;). If non-radiative recombination is substantial and non negligible, the open-circuit voltage will be reduced depending on the ratio between the radiative and non-radiative recombination currents (where the recombination currents are the integral of the recombination rates over volume). This leads to a second reciprocity relation between the photovoltaic and the luminescent operation mode of a solar cell because the ratio of radiative to total (radiative and non-radiative) recombination currents is the external luminescence quantum efficiency &lt;math&gt;Q_{e,lum}&lt;/math&gt; of a (light emitting) diode. Mathematically, this relation is expressed as&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite journal

{{Antennas|expanded=techniques}}
A '''reconfigurable antenna''' is an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] capable of modifying dynamically its frequency and radiation properties in a controlled and reversible manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Reconfigurable Antennas |year=2007 |publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers  |doi=10.2200/S00067ED1V01Y200707ANT004 | author=J.T. Bernhard.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to provide a dynamical response, reconfigurable antennas integrate an inner mechanism (such as [[RF switch]]es, [[varicap|varactors]], [[actuator|mechanical actuators]] or tunable materials) that enable the intentional redistribution of the RF currents over the antenna surface and produce reversible modifications over its properties. Reconfigurable antennas differ from [[smart antenna]]s because the reconfiguration mechanism lies inside the antenna rather than in an external [[beamforming]] network. The reconfiguration capability of reconfigurable antennas is used to maximize the antenna performance in a changing scenario or to satisfy changing operating requirements.

== Types of antenna reconfiguration ==
Reconfigurable antennas can be classified according to the antenna parameter that is dynamically adjusted, typically the [[radio frequency|frequency of operation]], [[radiation pattern]] or [[polarization (antenna)|polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Reconfigurable Antennas | title=Modern Antenna Handbook |year=2008 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=G.H. Huff and J.T. Bernhard. | editor=C.A. Balanis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frequency reconfiguration ===
Frequency reconfigurable antennas can adjust dynamically their [[radio frequency|frequency of operation]]. They are particularly useful in situations where several communications systems converge because the multiple antennas required can be replaced by a single reconfigurable antenna. Frequency reconfiguration is generally achieved by modifying physically or electrically the antenna dimensions using RF-switches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panagamuwa|first1=C.J.|last2=Chauraya|first2=A.|last3=Vardaxoglou|first3=J.C.|title=Frequency and beam reconfigurable antenna using photoconducting switches|journal=IEEE Trans.

=== Radiation pattern reconfiguration ===
Radiation pattern reconfigurability is based on the intentional modification of the spherical distribution of [[radiation pattern]]. [[Beam steering]] is the most extended application and consists in steering the direction of maximum radiation to maximize the antenna gain in a link with mobile devices. Pattern reconfigurable antennas are usually designed using movable/rotatable structures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiao|first1=J.C.|last2=Fu|first2=Y.|last3=Chio|first3=I.M.|last4=DeLisio|first4=M.|last5=Li|first5=L.Y.|title=MEMS reconfigurable vee antenna|journal=IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium|date=1999|volume=4|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.1999.780242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodrigo|first1=D.|last2=Jofre|first2=L.|last3=Cetiner|first3=B.A.|title=Circular Beam-Steering Reconfigurable Antenna With Liquid Metal Parasitics|journal=IEEE Trans.

In last 10 years, metamaterial-based reconfigurable antennas have gained attention due their small form factor, wide beam steering range and wireless applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mookiah|first1=P.|last2=Dandekar|first2=K.R.|title=Metamaterial-substrate antenna array for MIMO communication system|journal=IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation|date=2009|volume=57|doi=10.1109/TAP.2009.2028638|bibcode=2009ITAP...57.3283M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gulati|first1=N.|last2=Dandekar|first2=K.R.|title=Learning State Selection for Reconfigurable Antennas: A multi-armed bandit approach|journal=IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation|date=2014|volume=62|doi=10.1109/TAP.2013.2276414|bibcode=2014ITAP...62.1027G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polarization reconfiguration ===
Polarization reconfigurable antennas are capable of switching between different [[polarization (antenna)|polarization]] modes. The capability of switching between horizontal, vertical and circular polarizations can be used to reduce polarization mismatch losses in portable devices. Polarization reconfigurability can be provided by changing the balance between the different modes of a multimode structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simons|first1=R.N.|last2=Donghoon|first2=C.|last3=Katehi|first3=L.P.B.|title=Polarization reconfigurable patch antenna using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) actuators|journal=IEEE Antennas Propag. Soc. Int.Symp.|date=2002|volume=2|doi=10.1109/APS.2002.1016015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compound reconfiguration ===
Compound reconfiguration is the capability of simultaneously tuning several antenna parameters, for instance frequency and radiation pattern. The most common application of compound reconfiguration is the combination of frequency agility and beam-scanning to provide improved spectral efficiencies. Compound reconfigurability is achieved by combining in the same structure different single-parameter reconfiguration techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=X.S.|first1=Yang|last2=Wang|first2=B.Z.|last3=Wu|first3=W.|last4=Xiao|first4=S.|title=Yagi Patch Antenna With Dual-Band and Pattern Reconfigurable Characteristics|journal=IEEE Antennas Wireless Propag.

[[File:Reduzierstuecke 4055.jpg|thumb|250px|Reducer fittings, bronze threaded (left) and copper sweat (right)]]

A '''reducer''' is the component in a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] that reduces the [[Pipe (material)|pipe]] size from a larger to a smaller bore (inner [[diameter]]).

The length of the reduction is usually equal to the average of the larger and smaller pipe diameters. There are two main types of reducer: concentric and [[eccentric reducer]]s.

A reducer can be used either as nozzle or as diffuser depending on the [[mach number]] of the flow.

A reducer allows for a change in pipe size to meet hydraulic flow requirements of the system, or to adapt to existing piping of a different size. Reducers are usually concentric but eccentric reducers are used when required to maintain the same top-or bottom-of-pipe level.

These fittings are manufactured in inch and metric size.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2011}}

'''SAGE III on ISS''' is the fourth generation of a series of [[NASA]] Earth-observing instruments, known as the [[Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment]]. The first SAGE III instrument was launched on the Russian [[Meteor (satellite)]] spacecraft. The recently revised SAGE III will be mounted to the [[International Space Station]] where it will use the unique vantage point of ISS to make long-term measurements of [[ozone]], [[aerosols]], [[water vapor]], and other gases in [[Earth's atmosphere]].

== History of the SAGE legacy ==
The first SAGE instrument was launched February 18, 1979, to collect data on the various gases in the atmosphere, including ozone. The data collected on {{nowrap|SAGE I}} and the following instrument {{nowrap|SAGE II}}, which began taking measurements in {{nowrap|October 1984}}, were critical to the discovery of the Earth's [[ozone hole]] and the creation of 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], which banned ozone-depleting substances, such as [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC). 

SAGE III on ISS is a nearly exact replica of {{nowrap|SAGE III}} Meteor-3M, sent into orbit in 2001 on a Russian satellite. {{nowrap|SAGE III}} Meteor-3M went out of service in March 2006 when the satellite's power supply stopped working. The new instrument was built in anticipation of being attached to the space station in 2005. A change in ISS design, however, put those plans on hold. The instrument was stored in a Class 100 clean room in a sealed shipping container under a continuous gaseous nitrogen purge. The purge kept clean dry "air" inside the instrument. 

Recently, the opportunity arose for {{nowrap|SAGE III}} to be placed on ISS, and build on the long record of stratospheric gas data that its ancestors created. The week of February 14, 2011, scientists at [[NASA Langley Research Center]] pulled the instrument from storage to begin initial testing and calibrations in preparation prepping it for launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-03-sage-iii-iss-prepped.html|title=SAGE&amp;nbsp;III - ISS prepped for space station|last=Finneran|first=Michael|date=2011-03-03|publisher=Physorg.com|accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calibration.jpg|thumb|SAGE III-ISS preparing for its scan of the moon February 17, 2011. The SAGE team arrived at midnight to continue testing the instrument, which will be attached to the space station to measure ozone, water vapor and aerosols in the Earth's atmosphere.]]

== Science behind SAGE III on ISS ==
The 76-kilogram (168&amp;nbsp;lb)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacenews.com/earth_observation/110418-after-storage-ozone-mapper-launch.html|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20111008020907/http://spacenews.com/earth_observation/110418%2Dafter%2Dstorage%2Dozone%2Dmapper%2Dlaunch.html|dead-url=yes|title=After Years in Storage, Ozone Mapper Readied for 2014 Launch|last=Svitak|first=Amy|date=2011-04-18|publisher=SpaceNews.com|accessdate=8 January 2012|archive-date=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|SAGE III}} instrument is a grating [[spectrometer]] that measures ultraviolet and visible energy. It relies upon the flight-proven designs used in the Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement ({{nowrap|SAM I}}) and first and second SAGE instruments. The {{nowrap|SAGE III}} design incorporates Charge Coupled Device (CCD) array detectors and a 16 bit A/D converter. Combined, these devices allow for wavelength calibration, a self-consistent determination of the viewing geometry, lunar occultation measurements, and expanded wavelength coverage.

The SAGE III sensor assembly consists of pointing and imaging subsystems and a UV/visible spectrometer. The pointing and imaging systems are employed to acquire light from either the Sun or Moon by vertically scanning across the object. The spectrometer uses an 800 element CCD linear array to provide continuous spectral coverage between 290 and 1030&amp;nbsp;nm. Additional aerosol information is provided by a discrete photodiode at 1550&amp;nbsp;nm. This configuration enables {{nowrap|SAGE III}} to make multiple measurements of absorption features of target gaseous species and multi-wavelength measurements of broadband extinction by aerosols.

== Atmospheric components studied by SAGE III on ISS ==

[[File:SAGE III Instrument.jpg|thumb|SAGE III Instrument]]

The SAGE III mission is an important part of NASA's Earth Observation System and is designed to fulfill the primary scientific objective of obtaining high quality, global measurements of key components of atmospheric composition and their long-term variability.  The primary focus of {{nowrap|SAGE III}} on ISS will be to study aerosols, clouds, water vapor, pressure and temperature, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen trioxide, and chlorine dioxide.

=== Aerosols ===

Aerosols play an essential role in the radiative and chemical processes that govern the Earth's climate. Since stratospheric aerosol loading has varied by a factor of 30 since 1979, long-term monitoring of tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols is crucial. {{nowrap|SAGE III}} aerosol measurements will provide important contributions in the area of aerosol research.

=== Clouds ===

Clouds play a major role in determining the planet's solar and longwave energy balance and, thus, are important in governing the Earth's climate. {{nowrap|SAGE III}} will provide measurements of mid and high level clouds including thin or "sub-visual" clouds that are not detectable by nadir-viewing passive remote sensors. These observations are important because while low clouds primarily reflect incoming solar radiation back into space (acting to cool the planet), mid and high level clouds enhance the "greenhouse" effect by trapping infrared radiation (acting to warm the planet). Also, the presence of thin cloud near the tropopause may play a significant role in heterogeneous chemical processes that lead to ozone destruction in mid-latitudes.

=== Water vapor ===

Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas and plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate system. An improved understanding of the global water vapor distribution can enhance our ability to understand water's role in climate processes. {{nowrap|SAGE III}} water vapor measurements will provide important contributions on the long-term effect of this green house gas.

=== Ozone ===
[[File:NASA and NOAA Announce Ozone Hole is a Double Record Breaker.png|thumb|From September 21 to 30, 2006, the average area of the ozone hole was the largest ever observed, at 10.6 million square miles (27.5 million square kilometres). This image, from September 24, the Antarctic ozone hole was equal to the record single-day largest area of 11.4 million square miles (29.5 million square kilometres), reached on Sept. 9, 2000. The blue and purple colors are where there is the least ozone, and the greens, yellows, and reds are where there is more ozone.]]

Ozone research has remained at the forefront of atmospheric science for many years because stratospheric ozone shields the Earth's surface (and its inhabitants) from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Since recent declines in stratospheric ozone have been linked to human activity, accurate long-term measurements of ozone remain crucial. 

It is important to monitor ozone levels in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere since observed trends are the largest and most poorly understood at those altitudes. SAGE III's high vertical resolution and long-term stability make it uniquely well suited to make these measurements. {{nowrap|SAGE III}} will also be able to look at the relationship between aerosol, cloud, and chemical processes affecting ozone argue for simultaneous measurements of these atmospheric constituents (such as those made by {{nowrap|SAGE III}}).

=== Pressure and temperature ===

SAGE III temperature measurements will provide a unique data set for monitoring and understanding atmospheric temperature changes. In particular, the long-term stability and self-calibration capabilities of {{nowrap|SAGE III}} may permit the detection of trends in stratospheric and mesospheric temperature that will be important diagnostics of climate change. {{nowrap|SAGE III}} temperature measurements in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere will be a new source of long-term temperature measurements in this region of the atmosphere to complement existing long-term measurements made by satellites (MLS, ACE, SABER) and ground based lidar systems. {{nowrap|SAGE III}} temperature measurements will also allow the monitoring of periodic temperature changes, such as those associated with the solar cycle and quasi-biennial oscillation, and the effects of radiative forcing by aerosols.

=== Nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen trioxide, and chlorine dioxide ===

Nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen trioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and chlorine dioxide (OClO) play crucial roles in stratospheric chemistry and the catalytic cycles that destroy stratospheric ozone. {{nowrap|SAGE III}} NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; measurements are important because the processes that occur in the Antarctic winter and spring and give rise to the ozone hole effectively convert NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to nitric acid (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Thus NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an important diagnostic of ozone hole chemistry. Since it is measured during both solar and lunar occultation events, {{nowrap|SAGE III}} observations of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will improve our understanding of the strong diurnal (daily) cycles in stratospheric processes. In addition, {{nowrap|SAGE III}} will make virtually unique measurements of nitrogen trioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Although it is short-lived in the presence of sunlight, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plays an active role in the chemistry of other reactive nitrogen species such as NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and di-nitrogen pentoxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and, thus, indirectly in ozone chemistry.  Since few other measurements of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are available, {{nowrap|SAGE III}} measurements, which are made during lunar occultation (nighttime) events, will provide crucial validation for our current understanding of reactive nitrogen chemistry.

SAGE III was launched on the [[SpaceX CRS-10]] mission using a [[Falcon 9]] with [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]].  {{nowrap|SAGE III}} traveled in the unpressurized trunk of Dragon, which launched on February 19, 2017.&lt;ref name=sfn-20161031&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2016/10/31/spacex-hopes-procedure-fix-can-allow-falcon-9-launches-to-resume/ |title= SpaceX hopes procedure fix can allow Falcon 9 launches to resume |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=31 October 2016 |quote=NASA officials also expect SpaceX’s next resupply mission to the International Space Station to blast off around mid-January, at the soonest.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival, NASA used [[Dextre]] to berth the instrument onto an [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]] platform on the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/06/nasa-preparing-full-iss-utilisation-post-shuttle/|title=Tech Demos: NASA preparing for full ISS utilization in post-Shuttle era|last=Harding|first=Pete|date=2011-06-14|publisher=NASASpaceFlight.com (not affiliated with NASA)|accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/sage3.html|title=Time to Fly: SAGE&amp;nbsp;III - ISS Prepped for Space Station|date=2011-03-01|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International partners ==

NASA Langley Research Center, based out of Hampton, Virginia, is leading the {{nowrap|SAGE III}} mission. Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp. built the SAGE III-ISS instrument in Boulder, Colorado, and the European Space Agency and Thales Alenia Space, headquartered in France, are providing a hexapod to keep the instrument pointing in the right direction as the ISS maneuvers in space.

[[File:Sansui AU-11000.jpg|thumb|399x399px|The Sansui AU-11000 Integrated Amplifier]]
The '''Sansui AU-11000''' is a home audio integrated amplifier built by Japanese audio electronics manufacturer [[Sansui Electric|Sansui]] during the mid 1970s. The amplifier is known across the audiophile community for its high-output power and low total harmonic distortion (THD).

The AU-11000 has an output power of 110 watts-per-channel, and was one of the earliest home audio amplifiers to use multiple transistors per channel using a "Push-Pull" method to add more amplification power. The AU-11000 uses independent circuitry in the amplification process, in such a way that, each individual channel has its own circuits. This means everything from the power supply to the bias control board all have 2 identical and independent circuits per channel to separate the 2 stereo channels. This also minimizes the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) within the amplifier down to 0.08%.

The AU-11000 has its own power protection built into the amplifier. When the power switch is turned to the "ON" position, the power light comes on as green for a second, and turns red for a few seconds until the power protection circuitry has confirmed it is safe to power-up. Once it has finished, the power light turns and remains green until the amplifier is turned off. The AU-11000 also has its own block diagram printed on the upper-front casing.

Sansui designed the AU-11000 with the input, output and speaker terminals on the sides of the unit. The rear of the unit has the power cord and outlets only.

The AU-11000 has features such as a logarithmic volume control, a 3-position level-set muting, a -20db mute switch, 3-position high &amp; low filters, 3-Band Linear Bass/Midrange/Treble controls, 3 optional frequency settings for Bass &amp; Treble controls, 3-position Tone Selection, A &amp; B Speakers, Tape Input/Output control, 5-position mono-stereo selector switch, Tuner input, 2 Auxiliary inputs, 2 phono inputs, 2 rear 'always on' power outlets and 1 switched power outlet that is controlled by the units main power switch. There is an XLR input for Tape 2, and a spring-loaded ground connection plug.

There are a few variations of the Sansui AU-11000. Many units share some of the same internal components as the less-powerful AU-9900, such as the Bias Board [F-2580] and the Power Supply Board [F-2566], though the AU-11000 has much larger power capacitors. Some units have an 'A' at the end of the model number (AU-11000A), indicating it has 120 Watts-per-channel and a linear volume control.

[[File:Sansui AU-11000 Output Adustments (CORRECTED!!).png|thumb|DC Offset &amp; Current Bias Adjustments for models with the F-2583 Bias Board]]
There is a lot of discussion among the home audio community about how to properly set the DC Offset &amp; Current Bias within the amplifier. This is not something for the average do-it-yourself'er or handyman, and should be performed by a qualified technician.

AU-11000's with the F-2580 bias board can be adjusted using the service manual. AU-11000's with the F-2583 bias board have VR01 &amp; VR03 switched within the circuit. VR02 &amp; VR04 and also switched respectively. This means that the DC Offset &amp; Current Bias trim locations are switched with one-another on the F-2583, compared to the F-2580.

The Service Manual depicts proper adjustments of the F-2580 only. The picture on the right shows the proper illustration for the F-2583.

The AU-11000 uses 8 TO-3 style power-output transistors, 4 per channel. 2 of the 4 are Sanken 2SC1116 [NPN] transistors, and the other 2 are Sanken 2SA747 [PNP] transistors. Two of the same transistors are paired together onto a single Power Transistor Circuit [F-2581], and are paired with an identical circuit using the 2 different Power Transistors. The 2 circuits function together to power the respective channel using a "Push-Pull" method to create the 110 Watts per Channel. The 2 circuits make up each power amplifier per channel. This makes a total of 8 power-output transistors within the amplifier.

Each amplifier channel has a temperature sensor built-in as part of the power protection circuitry. If the amp is too hot, the power protection circuitry will not allow the amplifier to power on. The power protection circuit has (4) 2Amp fuses. There are (4) 7Amp fuses on the power supply board [F-2566]. Since the power supply board is actually 2 identical power supplies (1 per channel), there are 2 fuses per individual power supply.

There is a ground screw inside the front-bezel which links the ground to several of the AU-11000's circuit boards. This is often overlooked when checking the ground connections.

      <comment>Adding local [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]]: "A type of activated sludge process for the treatment of wastewater" ([[User:Galobtter/Shortdesc helper|Shortdesc helper]])</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7220">{{short description|A type of activated sludge process for the treatment of wastewater}}
'''Sequencing batch reactors''' ('''SBR''') or '''sequential batch reactors''' are a type of [[activated sludge]] process for the [[wastewater treatment|treatment of wastewater]]. SBR reactors treat wastewater such as [[sewage]] or output from [[anaerobic digester]]s or [[mechanical biological treatment]] facilities in batches. Oxygen is bubbled through the mixture of wastewater and activated sludge to reduce the organic matter (measured as [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) and [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD)). The treated effluent may be suitable for discharge to surface waters or possibly for use on land.

==Overview==
While there are several configurations of SBRs, the basic process is similar. The installation consists of one or more tanks that can be operated as [[plug flow]] or completely mixed reactors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Irvine|first = Robert L.|last2 = Busch|first2 = Arthur W.|date = 1979-01-01|title = Sequencing Batch Biological Reactors: An Overview|jstor = 25039819|journal = Journal (Water Pollution Control Federation)|volume = 51|issue = 2|pages = 235–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tanks have a “flow through” system, with raw wastewater (''influent'') coming in at one end and treated water (''effluent'') flowing out the other. In systems with multiple tanks, while one tank is in settle/decant mode the other is [[aeration|aerating]] and filling. In some systems, tanks contain a section known as the bio-selector, which consists of a series of walls or baffles which direct the flow either from side to side of the tank or under and over consecutive baffles. This helps to mix the incoming Influent and the ''returned activated sludge'' (RAS), beginning the biological digestion process before the liquor enters the main part of the tank.

==Treatment stages==
There are five stages in the treatment process:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#Fill
#React
#Settle
#Decant
#Idle

The inlet valve opens and the tank is being filled in, while mixing is provided by mechanical means (no air). This stage is also called the anoxic stage. Aeration of the mixed liquor is performed during the second stage by the use of fixed or floating mechanical pumps or by transferring air into [[fine bubble diffusers]] fixed to the floor of the tank. No aeration or mixing is provided in the third stage and the settling of suspended solids starts. During the fourth stage the outlet valve opens and the "clean" [[supernatant]] liquor exits the tank.&lt;ref name = "Antonie"&gt;{{cite book   | title = Troubleshooting the Sequencing Batch Reactor | author= Ronald L. Antonie | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location=  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CJ9c1vCBO4cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Sequencing+batch+reactor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAoOHyzMbZAhVotlkKHUtzAkkQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | date = 2011 | page =   | isbn = 9781118058220  | accessdate = 27 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3-8;19}}

==Removal of constituents==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
Aeration times vary according to the plant size and the composition/quantity of the incoming liquor, but are typically 60 to 90 minutes. The addition of [[oxygen]] to the liquor encourages the multiplication of [[aerobic bacteria]] and they consume the nutrients. This process encourages the conversion of nitrogen from its [[redox|reduced]] [[ammonia]] form to [[oxidized]] [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]] forms, a process known as [[nitrification]].

To remove [[phosphorus]] compounds from the liquor, [[aluminium sulfate]] (alum) is often added during this period. It reacts to form non-soluble compounds, which settle into the sludge in the next stage.&lt;ref&gt;New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission, Lowell, MA (2005). [http://www.neiwpcc.org/neiwpcc_docs/sbr_manual.pdf "Sequencing Batch Reactor Design and Operational Considerations."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''settling'' stage is usually the same length in time as the aeration. During this stage the sludge formed by the bacteria is allowed to settle to the bottom of the tank. The aerobic bacteria continue to multiply until the dissolved oxygen is all but used up. Conditions in the tank, especially near the bottom are now more suitable for the [[anaerobic bacteria]] to flourish. Many of these, and some of the bacteria which would prefer an oxygen environment, now start to use oxidized nitrogen instead of oxygen gas (as an alternate [[terminal electron acceptor]]) and convert the nitrogen to a gaseous state, as [[nitrogen oxides]] or, ideally, molecular nitrogen ([[dinitrogen]], N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas. This is known as [[denitrification]].

Anoxic SBR can be used for anaerobic processes, such as the removal of ammonia via [[Anammox]], or the study of slow-growing microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Strous|first = M.|last2 = Heijnen|first2 = J. J.|last3 = Kuenen|first3 = J. G.|last4 = Jetten|first4 = M. S. M.|title = The sequencing batch reactor as a powerful tool for the study of slowly growing anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing microorganisms|journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|volume = 50|issue = 5|pages = 589–596|doi = 10.1007/s002530051340|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the reactors are purged of oxygen by flushing with inert gas and there is no aeration.

As the bacteria multiply and die, the sludge within the tank increases over time and a waste activated sludge (WAS) pump removes some of the sludge during the settle stage to a digester for further treatment. The quantity or “age” of sludge within the tank is closely monitored, as this can have a marked effect on the treatment process.

The sludge is allowed to settle until clear water is on the top 20 to 30 percent of the tank contents.

The decanting stage most commonly involves the slow lowering of a scoop or “trough” into the basin. This has a piped connection to a lagoon where the final effluent is stored for disposal to a wetland, tree growing lot, ocean outfall, or to be further treated for use on parks, golf courses etc.

==Conversion==
In some situations in which a traditional treatment plant cannot fulfill required treatment (due to higher loading rates, stringent treatment requirements, etc.) the owner might opt to convert their traditional system into a multi-SBR plant. Conversion to SBR will create a longer sludge age, minimizing sludge handling requirements downstream of the SBR.&lt;ref name = "Antonie"/&gt;{{rp|8-10}}

The reverse can also be done where in SBR Systems would be converted into extended aeration (EA) systems. SBR treatment systems that could not cope up with a sudden constant increase of influent would easily be converted into EA plants. Extended aeration plants are more flexible in flow rate, eliminating restrictions presented by pumps located throughout the SBR systems. [[Clarifier]]s can be retrofitted in the equalization tanks of the SBR.

Prior to founding Better Place, Agassi was President of the Products and Technology Group (PTG) at [[SAP AG]] until 2007. In 2003, at the age of 36, Agassi was named one of the top 20 'Global Influentials for 2003' by [[CNN]]-[[Time magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1006324,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Agassi was included in TIME magazine's 100 most influential people list.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, Alan.{{cite news | url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1894410_1893209_1893476,00.html | title=The 2009 TIME 100:Shai Agassi | date=2009-05-07 | accessdate=2009-05-07 | publisher=[[TIME magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, [[Foreign Policy]] magazine included Agassi on its annual list of the [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|100 most influential global thinkers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,27 |title=Foreign Policy's Second Annual List of the 100 Top Global Thinkers |publisher=Foreign Policy |date= |accessdate=2013-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209081657/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,27 |archivedate=2013-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 90s, Agassi started and successfully sold a number of technology startups, in the areas of enterprise software, internet technology, multimedia and small business administration. Agassi has a bachelor's degree in computer science and has been awarded a large number of patents in software, automotive and energy infrastructure.

==Software entrepreneurship ==
[[File:Shai Agassi.jpg|thumb|Shai Agassi in 2006]]
After graduating from [[Technion - Israel Institute of Technology]], Agassi set out as a software entrepreneur. He founded TopTier Software (originally called Quicksoft Development) in [[Israel]] in 1992 and later moved the company's headquarters to [[California]]. Agassi served the company in various capacities including chairman, chief technology officer, and then CEO. He was directly involved in all critical phases of the company's development, including its strategic plan, technical direction and financing, management of two acquisitions, and negotiation of OEM agreements with companies such as SAP, Baan, and [[Microsoft]]. TopTier was a leading enterprise portal vendor when SAP acquired the company in April 2001 at a price of $400 million USD.

In addition to TopTier Software, Agassi co-founded several other companies with his father, Reuven Agassi, including Quicksoft Ltd., a leading [[multimedia]] software localization and distribution company in the Israeli market; TopManage, a developer of small business software that was also acquired by SAP in April 2002 (which became SAP Business One, the small business offering by SAP); and Quicksoft Media, a multimedia production company that ceased operations in 1995.

Many of these acquisitions were done while Agassi was already working at SAP, leading to many SAP employees to question these as an obvious conflict of interests.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== SAP executive ==
He wished to be the next CEO of [[SAP AG|SAP]] after [[Henning Kagermann]] vacated that space in 2007.&lt;ref name="fastcompany1"&gt;{{cite news |
url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3028159/a-broken-place-better-place |

author=Chafkin, Max |
publisher=Fast Company }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mr.  Kagermann's contract as CEO was extended until 2009 by the supervisory board. This led Agassi to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Agassi, Shai. (2007-03-28) [http://scn.sap.com/people/community.user/blog/2007/03/28/new-challenges-farewell "New Challenges &amp; Farewell"], SAP Community Network&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SAP Realigns Executive Board Responsibilities |url=http://global.sap.com:80/corporate-en/news.epx?pressid=7506 |publisher=SAP |date=28 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At SAP he was responsible for SAP's overall technology strategy and execution. In this leadership position, he oversaw the development of the integration and application platform SAP [[NetWeaver]], SAP [[xApps]] packaged composite applications, [[SAP SRM]], and [[SAP Business One]]. Before his appointment to the SAP Executive Board, Agassi was CEO of SAP Portals and later of the combined company SAP Markets and SAP Portals, which previously operated as a fully owned subsidiary of SAP AG. He was appointed to the SAP Executive Board in 2002. Together with the head of the Application Platform &amp; Architecture (AP&amp;A) group, Peter Zencke, Agassi co-led the Suite Architecture Team, which aligns the software architecture across all SAP solutions.

==Better Place==
In January 2008, the [[Israel]]i government announced its support for a broad effort to promote the use of electric cars, embracing a joint venture between [[Better Place (company)|Better Place]], [[Renault]] and its partner, [[Nissan Motor]] Company. Renault and Better Place were to work on the development of electric cars which could be powered by exchangeable batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/21/world/middleeast/21israel.html?ref=world | title=Israel Is Set to Promote the Use of Electric Cars | date=2008-01-21 | accessdate=2008-02-07 | publisher=New York Times | first=Steven | last=Erlanger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.projectbetterplace.com/press-room/press-releases/renault-nissan-and-project-better-place-prepare-first-mass-produced-electr | title=Renault-Nissan and Project Better Place prepare for first mass produced electric vehicles | date=2008-01-21 | accessdate=2008-02-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080128174532/http://www.projectbetterplace.com/press-room/press-releases/renault-nissan-and-project-better-place-prepare-first-mass-produced-electr &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellynch/2017/08/25/shai-agassi-and-a-better-place-a-greek-tragedy/#1340127a505a|title=Shai Agassi's Quest To Build A Dominant Auto Company: A Greek Tragedy|last=Lynch|first=Michael|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agassi initially raised $200MM for this project. Investors included [[VantagePoint Venture Partners]], [[Israel Corporation]], [[Israel Cleantech Ventures]], [[Morgan Stanley]], and private investors led by [[Michael Granoff]] of Maniv Energy Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cleantech-israel.blogspot.com/2008/04/michael-granoff-leading-cleantech.html | title=Michael Granoff, leading cleantech investor, interviewed by Ynet | accessdate=2008-05-12 | date=2008-04-15 | publisher= Cleantech Investing in Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he raised an additional $135 million for Better Place Denmark, including an investment from DONG Energy, the leading utility in Denmark. Following the announcement in Israel, Better Place had launched its network in Denmark, Australia and in two US locations - Hawaii and Northern California. The company said it was in talks with more than 25 countries around the world, but only in Israel were battery swap stations built. In early 2010, Better Place raised its Series-B round at an amount of $350MM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEC Form D, 2010-05-07|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1426900/000142690010000003/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml|work=SEC Form D, 2010-05-07, Better Place Inc., CIK 0001426900|publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=13 May 2011|author=Better Place Inc.|authorlink=Better Place (company)|date=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by new investors from HSBC, Morgan Stanley and Lazard, as well as all previous investors. In November 2011, the company raised its third equity financing round of $200 million from a group of investors including GE, UBS bank and others.

Agassi resigned his position as CEO of Better Place in October 2012.

[[File:SET schematic2.jpg|thumb|Fig. 1. Schematic of a basic SET and its different device parameters.]]
A '''single-electron transistor''' ('''SET''') is a sensitive electronic device based on the [[Coulomb blockade]] effect. In this device the electron flows through a tunnel junction between source/drain to a [[quantum dot]] (conductive island). Moreover, the electrical potential of the island can be tuned by a third electrode, known as the gate, which is capacitively coupled to the island.
Fig. 1 shows the basic schematic of a SET device. The conductive island is sandwiched between two tunnel junctions,&lt;ref&gt;S. Mahapatra, V. Vaish, C. Wasshuber, K. Banerjee, and A. M. Ionescu, "Analytical Modeling of Single Electron Transistor for Hybrid CMOS-SET Analog IC Design," IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, vol. 51, no. 11, pp. 1772–1782, Nov. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; which are modeled by a capacitance (''C''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) and a resistor (''R''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) in parallel.

== Introduction ==
The increasing relevance of the [[Internet of things]] and the healthcare applications give more relevant impact to the electronic device power consumption. For this purpose, ultra-low-power consumption is one of the main research topics into the current electronics world. The amazing number of tiny computers used in the day-to-day world, e.g. mobile phones and home electronics, implies a significant power consumption level by the implemented devices. In this scenario, the single-electron transistor has appeared as a suitable candidate to achieve this low power range with a high level of device integration. The main technological difference between the well-established [[MOSFET]] device (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) and the SET lies in the device channel concept. Instead of having a conduction channel, as in case of MOSFET, which does not allow further reductions in its length, this channel is replaced by a small conducting "island" or [[quantum dot]] (QD).&lt;ref&gt;K. Uchida, K. Matsuzawa, J. Koga, R. Ohba, S. I. Takagi, and A. Toriumi, "Analytical single-electron transistor (SET) model for design and analysis of realistic SET circuits," Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., vol. 39, no. 4 B, pp. 2321–2324, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The device thus takes advantage of the Coulomb-blockade phenomenon in controlling the transfer of individual electrons to the QD. Source and drain regions are separated from the QD by tunnel junctions. The research on SET is mainly supported by "orthodox theory" based on three assumptions:

#The electron energy quantization inside the conductors is ignored, i.e. the electron energy spectrum is treated as continuous, which is valid only if &lt;math&gt;E_k\ll k_BT&lt;/math&gt;, where ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]] and ''T'' is the temperature.
#The time (τ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) of electron tunnelling through the barrier is assumed to be negligibly small in comparison with the other time scales. This assumption is valid for tunnel barriers used in single-electron devices of practical interest, where τ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; ~10-15s.
#Coherent quantum processes consisting of several simultaneous tunnelling events, i.e. co-tunnelling, are ignored. This assumption is valid if the resistance of all the tunnel barriers of the system is much higher than the quantum resistance (~26 kΩ), to confine the electrons to the island.

The main benefits of the SET use are a high device integration level and ultra-low power consumption. Moreover, the SET fabrication process is [[CMOS]]-compatible (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor), which increases the possibilities for integrating them into complex circuits. At this point some drawbacks appear to be overcome such as low current level and the low temperature operation. The current level of the SET can be amplified by manufacturing together with a [[field-effect transistor]] (FET), by generating a hybrid SET-FET circuit&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Ionescu, S. Mahapatra, and V. Pott, "Hybrid SETMOS Architecture With Coulomb Blockade Oscillations and High Current Drive," IEEE Electron Device Lett., vol. 25, no. 6, pp. 411–413, Jun. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Amat, J. Bausells, and F. Perez-Murano, "Exploring the Influence of Variability on Single-Electron Transistors Into SET-Based Circuits," IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, vol. 64, no. 12, pp. 5172–5180, Dec. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; (Fig. 2).

[[File:SETFET schematic.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2. Schematic of a hybrid SET-FET circuit.]]

Afterwards, the thermal fluctuations can suppress the [[Coulomb blockade]]; then, the electrostatic charging energy {{math|(''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''C''&lt;sub&gt;∑&lt;/sub&gt;)}} must be greater than ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T''. This condition implies the maximum allowed island capacitance is inversely proportional to temperature. For these systems, to solve the drawback related to the SET operative only at cryogenic temperature it should be considered that an island capacitance below 1 aF is required to be room temperature operative. Note that the island capacitance is a function of their size. In this sense, to manufacture room temperature operative SETs the island size should be reduced towards 10&amp;nbsp;nm. Note that this level of device dimensions can jeopardize the SET manufacturability.

== New manufacturing proposals ==
In this context, the relevance of the SET-based circuits have been recently highlighted through the granting of a project by the European Union, IONS4SET (#688072). The project looks for the manufacturing feasibility of SET-FET circuits operative at room temperature. The main goal of this project is to design SET manufacturability process-flow for large-scale operations seeking to extend the use of the hybrid SET-CMOS architectures. To assure room temperature operation, single dots of diameters below 5&amp;nbsp;nm have to be fabricated and located between source and drain with tunnel distances of a few nanometers.&lt;ref&gt;F. Klupfel, A. Burenkov, J. Lorenz, "Simulation of silicon-dot-based single-electron memory devices," Int. Conf. SISPAD, pp. 237–240, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Up to now there is no reliable process-flow to manufacture a hybrid SET-FET circuit operative at room temperature. In this context, this EU project explores a more feasible way to manufacture the SET-FET circuit by using pillar dimensions of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;nm.

'''Snap freezing''' (or '''cook-chill''' or '''blast freezing''') is the process of rapid cooling of a substance for the purpose of preservation. It is widely used in the culinary and scientific industries.

==Culinary use==
[[cooking|Cooked meals]] can be preserved by rapid freezing after cooking is almost complete. The main target group for these products are those with little time for cooking such as [[school]]s, [[prisons]], and [[hospital]]s.

The process involves the cooking of [[meal]]s at a central factory, rapidly chilling them for storage until they are needed. Cook chill foods need to be packed in shallow trays to make the process more efficient. The food is cooled to a temperature under 3 degrees Celsius within 90 minutes of cooking and stored at a maintained temperature of 0 to 3 degrees Celsius. The meals can then be transported in refrigerated transport to where the food is to be reheated and consumed when needed. 
 
The length of storage depends on the method used but is usually five days. For longer storage the food may be subjected to [[pasteurization]] after cooking.

These processes have the advantage that preparation and cooking of meals is not tied to the times when the food is to be served, enabling staff and equipment to be used more efficiently. A properly managed operation is capable of supplying high quality meals economically despite high initial equipment costs. There are potential problems; careful attention has to be paid to [[hygiene]], as there are a number of points in the process where food [[pathogens]] can gain access. This requires careful attention to both the control of the process and to staff training.

==Scientific use==
'''Snap-freeze''' is a term often used in scientific papers to describe a process by which a sample is very quickly lowered to temperatures below -70&amp;nbsp;°C. This is often accomplished by submerging a sample in [[liquid nitrogen]]. This prevents water from crystallising when it forms ice, and so better preserves the structure of the sample (e.g. [[RNA]], [[protein]], or live [[cell (biology)|cell]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Collection, Storage, Retrieval and Distribution of Biological Materials for Research |journal=Cell Preservation Technology |date=1 March 2008 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=3–58 |doi=10.1089/cpt.2008.9997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trailing cones''' (or trailing wires as they are often incorrectly called or trailing static cones), were first developed and tested in the 1950s and 1960s as a simple means of calibrating the static pressure (altitude reporting) error of an aircraft's [[pitot-static system]]. It does this by giving an accurate measurement of the ambient atmospheric pressure (static pressure) well clear of the aircraft's fuselage.  The trailing cone system trails at least one fuselage length behind the aircraft (SpaceAge Control) via a high-strength pressure tube.  Static pressure is measured forward of the cone by several static ports. The cone stabilizes and aligns the ports relative to the freestream airflow.

The FAA states in Advisory Circular AC 91-85A:
"Where precision flight calibrations are used to quantify or verify altimetry system performance they may be accomplished by any of the following methods.  Flight calibrations should only be performed once appropriate ground checks have been completed.  Uncertainties in application of the method must be assessed and taken into account in the data package.

==Precision static pressure measurement methods==
* Precision tracking radar in conjunction with pressure calibration of atmosphere at test altitude.
* '''Trailing cone.'''               
* Chase aircraft.
* Any other method acceptable to the approving authority.

[[Image:Cartello piedibus.jpg|thumb|Sign for a walking bus stop in the Italian city of [[Zanica]]]]
[[File:Haltestellentafel eines Pedibus.jpg|thumb|A walking bus stop in Germany]]
A '''walking bus''' is a form of [[student transport]] for schoolchildren who, [[Chaperone (social)|chaperoned]] by two adults (a "Driver" leads and a "conductor" follows), walk to school along a set route, in much the same way a [[school bus]] would drive them to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://saferoutespartnership.org/sites/default/files/resource_files/step-by-step-walking-school-bus.pdf|title=Step By Step: How to Start a Walking School Bus|last=Moening|first=Kate|date=2016|website=|publisher=California Department of Public Health|page=2|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like a traditional bus, walking buses have a fixed route with designated "bus stops" and "pick up times" in which they pick up children.

==History==

The concept of the walking bus was first invented in Japan&lt;ref name="Japan"&gt;{{cite web

| author      = [[David Engwicht]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;   is  often  given  credit  for  inventing  the  WSB  system  in  the  1990s. It was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1998 by [[Hertfordshire County Council]]. It was first used by pupils of [[Wheatfields Junior School]] in [[St Albans]], [[United Kingdom]] in 1998 &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/880055.stm BBC News Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Walking Buses have remained popular in the [[United Kingdom]] and have recently gained a level of popularity elsewhere in Europe, North America&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.walkingschoolbus.org/ Start a Walking School Bus]", Partnership for a Walkable America&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New Zealand]]. Proponents of walking buses say that its aims are to:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwalktoschool.org/ The Official Website of  International Walk to School]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Encourage physical activity  by teaching children the skills to walk safely, how to identify safe routes to school, and the benefits of walking
*Raise awareness of extent of a community's walkability and where improvements can be made
*Raise concern for the environment
*Reduce crime and take back neighborhoods for people on foot
*Reduce traffic congestion, pollution, and speed near schools
*Share valuable time with local community leaders, parents, and children

In [[Auckland]], New Zealand, as of November 2007, one hundred schools run 230 Walking School Buses with over 4,000 children and 1,500 adults participating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelwise.org.nz/media/pdf/2007_STPeval.pdf Auckland Regional Transport Authority School Travel Evaluation for the 2007 school year]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, parents and/or children on walking buses are encouraged to wear brightly coloured jackets or waistcoats.  This has led to criticism that the walking bus is too regimented, and fails to achieve its original purpose of improving children's independent mobility.  [[David Engwicht]], whose 1992 book "Reclaiming our Cities and Towns" is credited by some as the origin of the Walking School Bus concept, has since stated that "The moment the Walking Bus turns into an official program, it creates some significant difficulties, particularly in litigious and risk-adverse cultures."&lt;ref name="David Engwicht"/&gt;

== Public health ==
[[File:Walking bus stop, Station Road - geograph.org.uk - 291411.jpg|thumb|Walking bus stop.]]
The walking school bus can help to reduce [[childhood obesity]] rates in the United States by increasing active transportation to school. The [[American Public Health Association]] cites that participation in active transportation to school has reduced by a third in the last 40 years.&lt;ref name=Association2012&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Safe Routes to School: Helping All Students Walk and Bike Safely

 | accessdate = 2012-07-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in active transportation has coincided with an increase in childhood obesity rates. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reports the prevalence of obesity among children has doubled and among adolescents has quadrupled in the past 30 years. In 2012, 18% of children and 21% of adolescents were obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/obesity/facts.htm|title=Obesity Prevention {{!}} Healthy Schools {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Safe Routes to School National Partnership, 1 mile of walking equates to 2/3rds of the recommendation of 60 minutes a day.&lt;ref&gt;http://saferoutespartnership.org/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the potential health benefits, the walking school bus can help children arrive to school safely, on time, and ready to learn. Walking to school counts towards the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity a day.&lt;ref&gt;http://saferoutespartnership.org&lt;/ref&gt; Another benefit is the positive association between physical activity and improved academic performance. In a study done by the CDC, they found that with a minimum of 60 minutes a day there were increase in academic behavior, cognitive skills and attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/health_and_academics/pdf/pa-pe_paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The communities that support walking buses may see reduced congestion around school grounds. The walking bus is a non-polluting and sustainable transport alternative to cars and buses. In regards to the safety of the walking bus; the section about Safe Routes to School below goes into more detail about improvements being made to increase the safety for commuting pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5455454c#page-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The built environment plays the biggest role in whether or not a community is walkable. The [[built environment]] consists of the human made surroundings that affect one’s life. There are numerous factors that make up the built environment including the availability and quality of sidewalks, crosswalks and parks, the amount of traffic and proximity to schools/parks/shops, etc.  These factors determine the [[walkability]] of an area.

Walkability has been shown to be closely tied to childhood obesity. One study found that “the chances of a child being obese or overweight were 20-60 percent higher among children in neighborhoods where it was not safe to walk around or where there were no sidewalks.” &lt;ref name="Khan2011"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, children in neighborhoods with sidewalks and safe places to cross the street are more likely to be physically active than children living in neighborhoods without those safe infrastructure elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Do attributes in the physical environment influence children’s physical activity?

The walking bus depends on a walkable and safe built environment. [http://www.saferoutesinfo.org/ Safe Routes to School] is US government program that funds improvements in the built environment near schools.

===Policies and regulations===
 
In 2005, the US Federal Transportation Reauthorization Bill—The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA-LU 109-59) was passed which provided nearly $1 billion funding to all states for Safe Routes to School (SRTS) programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guide.saferoutesinfo.org/introduction/history_of_srts.cfm|title=SRTS Guide: History of Safe Routes to School|website=guide.saferoutesinfo.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program's purpose is to: “enable and encourage children, including those with disabilities, to walk and bicycle to school; to make walking and bicycling to school safe and more appealing; and to facilitate the planning, development and implementation of projects that will improve safety, and reduce traffic, fuel consumption, and air pollution in the vicinity of schools.” It is a 100% federally funded program which is administered by state departments of transportation. Money goes towards infrastructure-related programs in addition to non-infrastructure activities such as education and enforcement-year time period, restricting data to school-travel hours.

This law is central to the success of programs like the Walking Bus because it identifies the many components involved. Active transport to school and examples such as the walking school bus require collaboration from many different sectors (transportation, law enforcement, school policies, and local government to name a few). In addition, the ability to create an environment conducive to walkability is dependent on the built environment as well as numerous policies from these various sectors.

According to the Institute of Medicine Report, Measuring Progress in Obesity Prevention, the environment people live in can have a profound effect on the amount of physical activity which they engage in. According to James Sallis in his workshop presentation, informal or formal policies issued by the government or private sector, can affect physical activity in four ways. First, zoning, building codes, public transportation and recreational facility policies affect ability to engage in physical activity. Second, policies affecting physical activity in schools—physical education classes, recess, and walkability to and from school. Policies providing incentives such as parking and commuting in other ways, and insurance subsidies promote walkability and physical activity for adults. Finally funding policies have a strong influence on physical activity. The 2005 federal law supporting safe Routes to School is meant to facilitate physical activity and increase walkability.&lt;ref name=Report2012&gt;{{Citation

Two national programs that focus on physical activity environment policies are the Health and Human Services Healthy People 2020 and the National Physical Activity Plan, sponsored by numerous organizations including the YMCA, the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Association. The plan is a public-private partnership to create policies that promote physical activity for all individuals. Healthy People 2020 lists objectives to boost physical activity and also supports the recording of national data to track interventions. These are two examples of policies to promote physical activity. The Walking School Bus fits into their programs because it increases activity and translates a sedentary time of the day (transport in car or bus to school) to an active one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Safe Routes to School ==
Pedestrian injuries have found to be associated with the built environment elements, rather than with increased walking to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothman|first=Linda|last2=Macarthur|first2=Colin|last3=To|first3=Teresa|last4=Buliung|first4=Ron|last5=Howard|first5=Andrew|date=2014-05-01|title=Motor Vehicle-Pedestrian Collisions and Walking to School: The Role of the Built Environment|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/133/5/776|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=133|issue=5|pages=776–784|doi=10.1542/peds.2013-2317|issn=0031-4005|pmid=24709929}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.saferoutesinfo.org/ Safe Routes to School] (SRTS) provides federal funds for improvements of the [[built environment]] near schools with the goal of increasing walking and biking to school.

The effectiveness of SRTS has been demonstrated in multiple studies. One national study analyzed data across 18 states over 16 years. The study compared rates of pedestrian/bicyclist injury in school-aged children to adults, restricting data to school-travel hours. While adult injury rates were largely unchanged over the study period, implementation of SRTS was associated with around a 20% reduction in both in pedestrian/bicyclist injury and fatality risk in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DiMaggio|first=Charles|last2=Frangos|first2=Spiros|last3=Li|first3=Guohua|date=2016-06-01|title=National Safe Routes to School program and risk of school-age pedestrian and bicyclist injury|journal=Annals of Epidemiology|volume=26|issue=6|pages=412–417|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2016.04.002|issn=1873-2585|pmid=27230492}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Texas, traffic crash data over 5 years showed that pedestrian and bicyclist injuries decreased about 40% after implementation of SRTS.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DiMaggio|first=Charles|last2=Brady|first2=Joanne|last3=Li|first3=Guohua|date=2015-12-01|title=Association of the Safe Routes to School program with school-age pedestrian and bicyclist injury risk in Texas|journal=Injury Epidemiology|volume=2|issue=1|pages=15|doi=10.1186/s40621-015-0038-3|pmc=5005687|pmid=27747747}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York city, SRTS decreased pedestrian injury by one-third in school-age children.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimaggio|first=Charles|last2=Li|first2=Guohua|date=2013-02-01|title=Effectiveness of a safe routes to school program in preventing school-aged pedestrian injury|journal=Pediatrics|volume=131|issue=2|pages=290–296|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-2182|issn=1098-4275|pmc=3557410|pmid=23319533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SRTS programs are also effective in increasing walking and bicycling. In California, the effect of SRTS implementation varied widely but rates of observed walking and biking to school increased by 20 to 200%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=R.|first=Orenstein, Marla|last2=Nicolas|first2=Gutierrez,|last3=M.|first3=Rice, Thomas|last4=F.|first4=Cooper, Jill|last5=R.|first5=Ragland, David|date=2007-04-01|title=Safe Routes to School Safety and Mobility Analysis|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5455454c#page-3|journal=Safe Transportation Research &amp; Education Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waveguide post filter: a band-pass filter consisting of a length of WG15 (a standard waveguide size for [[X band]] use) divided into a row of five [[coupled oscillation|coupled]] [[microwave cavity|resonant cavities]] by fences of three posts each. The ends of the posts can be seen protruding through the wall of the guide.]]

A '''waveguide filter''' is an [[electronic filter]] that is constructed with [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] technology.  Waveguides are hollow metal tubes inside which an [[electromagnetic wave]] may be transmitted.  Filters are devices used to allow signals at some frequencies to pass (the [[passband]]), while others are rejected (the [[stopband]]).  Filters are a basic component of [[electronic engineering]] designs and have numerous applications.  These include [[Selectivity (electronic)|selection]] of [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] and limitation of [[Noise (electronics)|noise]].  Waveguide filters are most useful in the [[microwave]] band of frequencies, where they are a convenient size and have low [[insertion loss|loss]].  Examples of [[microwave filter]] use are found in [[satellite communications]], [[telephone network]]s, and [[television broadcasting]].

Waveguide filters were [[Technology during World War II|developed during World War II]] to meet the needs of [[radar]] and [[electronic countermeasure]]s, but afterwards soon found civilian applications such as use in [[microwave link]]s. Much of post-war development was concerned with reducing the bulk and weight of these filters, first by using new analysis techniques that led to elimination of unnecessary components, then by innovations such as dual-mode [[cavity resonator|cavities]] and novel materials such as [[ceramic resonator]]s.

A particular feature of waveguide filter design concerns the [[normal mode|mode]] of transmission.  Systems based on pairs of [[Electrical conductor|conducting]] wires and similar technologies have only one mode of transmission.  In waveguide systems, any number of modes are possible.  This can be both a disadvantage, as spurious modes frequently cause problems, and an advantage, as a dual-mode design can be much smaller than the equivalent waveguide single mode design.  The chief advantages of waveguide filters over other technologies are their ability to handle high power and their low loss.  The chief disadvantages are their bulk and cost when compared with technologies such as [[microstrip]] filters.

There is a wide array of different types of waveguide filters.  Many of them consist of a chain of coupled resonators of some kind that can be modelled as a [[ladder network]] of [[LC circuit]]s.  One of the most common types consists of a number of coupled [[resonant cavity|resonant cavities]].  Even within this type, there are many subtypes, mostly differentiated by the means of [[Coupling (electronics)|coupling]].  These coupling types include apertures,{{glosslink|aperture|w}} irises,{{glosslink|iris|x}} and posts.  Other waveguide filter types include [[dielectric resonator]] filters, insert filters, finline filters, corrugated-waveguide filters, and stub filters.  A number of waveguide components have [[filter theory]] applied to their design, but their purpose is something other than to filter signals.  Such devices include [[impedance matching]] components, [[directional coupler]]s, and [[diplexer]]s.  These devices frequently take on the form of a filter, at least in part.

==Scope==

The common meaning of ''waveguide'', when the term is used unqualified, is the hollow metal kind, but other waveguide technologies are possible.&lt;ref&gt;Gibilisco &amp; Sclater, [https://www.google.co.uk/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=%22The+term+waveguide+has+come+to+mean+a+hollow+metal+tube%22 page 913]&lt;/ref&gt;  The scope of this article is limited to the metal-tube type.  The [[#Post-wall waveguide|post-wall waveguide]] structure is something of a variant, but is related enough to include in this article—the wave is mostly surrounded by conducting material.  It is possible to construct [[waveguide (optics)|waveguides out of dielectric rods]],&lt;ref&gt;Yeh &amp; Shimabukuro, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; the most well known example being [[optical fibre]]s.  This subject is outside the scope of the article with the exception that dielectric rod resonators are sometimes used ''inside'' hollow metal waveguides.  [[Transmission line]]{{glosslink|tl|o}} technologies such as conducting wires and microstrip can be thought of as waveguides,&lt;ref&gt;Russer, pages 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; but are not commonly called such and are also outside the scope of this article.

==Basic concepts==

===Filters===
In [[electronics]], [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]] are used to allow signals of a certain band of [[frequency|frequencies]] to pass while blocking others.  They are a basic building block of electronic systems and have a great many applications.  Amongst the uses of waveguide filters are the construction of [[duplexer]]s, [[diplexer]]s,{{glosslink|Dx|d}} and [[multiplexer]]s; [[Selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]] and [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] limitation in [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]]; and [[harmonic distortion]] suppression in [[transmitter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Belov ''et al.'', page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waveguides===
[[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|Waveguide]]s are metal conduits used to confine and direct radio signals.  They are usually made of brass, but aluminium and copper are also used.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, page 52&lt;/ref&gt;  Most commonly they are rectangular, but other [[Multiview orthographic projection#Cross-section|cross-sections]] such as circular or elliptical are possible.  A waveguide filter is a filter composed of waveguide components.  It has much the same range of applications as other filter technologies in electronics and radio engineering but is very different mechanically and in principle of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Hunter, page 201|Matthaei ''et al.'', page 243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology used for constructing filters is chosen to a large extent by the frequency of operation that is expected, although there is a large amount of overlap.  Low frequency applications such as [[audio electronics]] use filters composed of discrete [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s.  Somewhere in the [[very high frequency]] band, designers switch to using components made of pieces of transmission line.{{glosslink|tl|p}}  These kinds of designs are called [[distributed element filter]]s.  Filters made from discrete components are sometimes called [[lumped element model|lumped element]] filters to distinguish them.  At still higher frequencies, the [[microwave]] bands, the design switches to waveguide filters, or sometimes a combination of waveguides and transmission lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Hitchcock &amp; Patterson, page 263|Bagad, pages 1.3–1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waveguide filters have much more in common with transmission line filters than lumped element filters; they do not contain any discrete capacitors or inductors.  However, the waveguide design may frequently be equivalent (or approximately so) to a lumped element design.  Indeed, the design of waveguide filters frequently starts from a lumped element design and then converts the elements of that design into waveguide components.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', page 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modes===
[[File:Selected modes.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|'''Figure 2.''' The field patterns of some common waveguide modes]]
One of the most important differences in the operation of waveguide filters compared to transmission line designs concerns the mode of transmission of the [[electromagnetic wave]] carrying the signal.  In a transmission line, the wave is associated with electric currents on a pair of conductors.  The conductors constrain the currents to be parallel to the line, and consequently both the magnetic and electric components of the [[electromagnetic field]] are perpendicular to the direction of travel of the wave.  This [[transverse mode]] is designated TEM{{glosslink|TEM|l}} (transverse electromagnetic).  On the other hand, there are infinitely many modes that any completely hollow waveguide can support, but the TEM mode is not one of them. Waveguide modes are designated either TE{{glosslink|TE|m}} (transverse electric) or TM{{glosslink|TM|n}} (transverse magnetic), followed by a pair of suffixes identifying the precise mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Connor, pages 52–53|Hunter, pages 201, 203|Matthaei ''et al.'', page 197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This multiplicity of modes can cause problems in waveguide filters when spurious modes are generated.  Designs are usually based on a single mode and frequently incorporate features to suppress the unwanted modes.  On the other hand, advantage can be had from choosing the right mode for the application, and even sometimes making use of more than one mode at once.  Where only a single mode is in use, the waveguide can be modelled like a conducting transmission line and results from transmission line theory can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Hunter, pages 255–260|Matthaei ''et al.'', page 197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cutoff===
Another feature peculiar to waveguide filters is that there is a definite frequency, the [[Cutoff frequency#Waveguides|cutoff frequency]], below which no transmission can take place.  This means that in theory [[low-pass filter]]s cannot be made in waveguides.  However, designers frequently take a lumped element low-pass filter design and convert it to a waveguide implementation.  The filter is consequently low-pass by design and may be considered a low-pass filter for all practical purposes if the cutoff frequency is below any frequency of interest to the application.  The waveguide cutoff frequency is a function of transmission mode, so at a given frequency, the waveguide may be usable in some modes but not others.  Likewise, the [[guide wavelength]]{{glosslink|λg|h}} (λ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[characteristic impedance]]{{glosslink|Z0|b}} (''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) of the guide at a given frequency also depend on mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Hunter, pages 201–202|Matthaei ''et al.'', page 197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dominant mode===
The mode with the lowest cutoff frequency of all the modes is called the dominant mode.  Between cutoff and the next highest mode, this is the only mode it is possible to transmit, which is why it is described as dominant.  Any spurious modes generated are rapidly attenuated along the length of the guide and soon disappear.  Practical filter designs are frequently made to operate in the dominant mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Elmore &amp; Heald, page 289|Mahmoud, pages 32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rectangular waveguide, the TE&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;{{glosslink|TE10|q}} mode (shown in figure 2) is the dominant mode.  There is a band of frequencies between the dominant mode cutoff and the next highest mode cutoff in which the waveguide can be operated without any possibility of generating spurious modes.  The next highest cutoff modes are TE&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;,{{glosslink|TE20|r}} at exactly twice the TE&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; mode, and TE&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;{{glosslink|TE01|s}} which is also twice TE&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; if the waveguide used has the commonly used [[aspect ratio]] of 2:1.  The lowest cutoff TM mode is TM&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;{{glosslink|TM11|t}} (shown in figure 2) which is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt 5&lt;/math&gt; times the dominant mode in 2:1 waveguide.  Thus, there is an [[octave]] over which the dominant mode is free of spurious modes, although operating too close to cutoff is usually avoided because of phase distortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Hunter, page 209, |Matthaei ''et al.'', page 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In circular waveguide, the dominant mode is TE&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;{{glosslink|TE11c|u}} and is shown in figure 2.  The next highest mode is TM&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;.{{glosslink|TM01c|v}}  The range over which the dominant mode is guaranteed to be spurious-mode free is less than that in rectangular waveguide; the ratio of highest to lowest frequency is approximately 1.3 in circular waveguide, compared to 2.0 in rectangular guide.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 198, 201&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evanescent modes===
{{main article|Evanescent wave}}
[[Evanescent wave#Evanescent-wave coupling|Evanescent mode]]s are modes below the cutoff frequency.  They cannot propagate down the waveguide for any distance, dying away exponentially.  However, they are important in the functioning of certain filter components such as irises and posts, described later, because energy is stored in the evanescent wave fields.&lt;ref&gt;Das &amp; Das, page 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Like transmission line filters, waveguide filters always have multiple [[passband]]s, replicas of the lumped element [[prototype filter|prototype]].  In most designs, only the lowest frequency passband is useful (or lowest two in the case of [[band-stop filter]]s) and the rest are considered unwanted spurious artefacts.  This is an intrinsic property of the technology and cannot be designed out, although design can have some control over the frequency position of the spurious bands.  Consequently, in any given filter design, there is an upper frequency beyond which the filter will fail to carry out its function.  For this reason, true low-pass and [[high-pass filter]]s cannot exist in waveguide.  At some high frequency there will be a spurious passband or stopband interrupting the intended function of the filter.  But, similar to the situation with waveguide cutoff frequency, the filter can be designed so that the edge of the first spurious band is well above any frequency of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Lee, page 789|Matthaei ''et al.'', page 541|Sorrentino &amp; Bianchi, page 262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of frequencies over which waveguide filters are useful is largely determined by the waveguide size needed.  At lower frequencies the waveguide needs to be impractically large in order to keep the cutoff frequency below the operational frequency.  On the other hand, filters whose operating frequencies are so high that the wavelengths are sub-millimetre cannot be manufactured with normal [[machine shop]] processes.  At frequencies this high, fibre-optic technology starts to become an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Hunter, page 201|Eskelinen &amp; Eskelinen, page 269|Middleton &amp; Van Valkenburg, pages 30.26–30.28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waveguides are a low-loss medium.  Losses in waveguides mostly come from [[Joule heating|ohmic]] dissipation caused by currents induced in the waveguide walls.  Rectangular waveguide has lower loss than circular waveguide and is usually the preferred format, but the TE&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; circular mode is very low loss and has applications in long distance communications.  Losses can be reduced by polishing the internal surfaces of the waveguide walls.  In some applications which require rigorous filtering, the walls are plated with a thin layer of gold or silver to improve surface [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].  An example of such requirements is satellite applications which require low loss, high selectivity, and linear group delay from their filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Belov ''et al.'', page 147|Connor, pages 6, 64|Hunter, page 230|Matthaei ''et al.'', page 243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main advantages of waveguide filters over TEM mode technologies is the quality of their [[resonator]]s.  Resonator quality is characterised by a parameter called [[Q factor]], or just ''Q''.  The ''Q'' of waveguide resonators is in the thousands, orders of magnitude higher than TEM mode resonators.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Sorrentino &amp; Bianchi, page 691|Hunter, page 201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of conductors, especially in wound inductors, limits the ''Q'' of TEM resonators.  This improved ''Q'' leads to better performing filters in waveguides, with greater stop band rejection.  The limitation to ''Q'' in waveguides comes mostly from the ohmic losses in the walls described earlier, but silver plating the internal walls can more than double ''Q''.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, pages 201, 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Waveguides have good power handling capability, which leads to filter applications in [[radar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Belov ''et al.'', page 147|Bowen, page 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the performance advantages of waveguide filters, [[microstrip]] is often the preferred technology due to its low cost.  This is especially true for consumer items and the lower microwave frequencies.  Microstrip circuits can be manufactured by cheap [[printed circuit]] technology, and when integrated on the same printed board as other circuit blocks they incur little additional cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Das &amp; Das, page 310|Waterhouse, page 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:PSM V25 D738 John William Strutt Lord Rayleigh.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.55|alt=likeness of|[[Lord Rayleigh]] first suggested waveguide transmission.]]
The idea of a waveguide for electromagnetic waves was first suggested by [[Lord Rayleigh]] in 1897.  Rayleigh proposed that a [[coaxial cable|coaxial transmission line]] could have the centre conductor removed, and waves would still propagate down the inside of the remaining cylindrical conductor despite there no longer being a complete electrical circuit of conductors.  He described this in terms of the wave reflecting repeatedly off the internal wall of the outer conductor in a zig-zag fashion as it progressed down the waveguide.  Rayleigh was also the first to realise that there was a critical wavelength, the cutoff wavelength, proportional to the cylinder diameter, above which wave propagation is not possible.  However, interest in waveguides waned because lower frequencies were more suitable for long distance radio communication.  Rayleigh's results were forgotten for a time and had to be rediscovered by others in the 1930s when interest in microwaves revived.  Waveguides were first developed, in a circular form, by [[George Clark Southworth]] and J. F. Hargreaves in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar ''et al.'', pages 90, 129, 545–546&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[analogue filter]] design which went beyond a simple single resonator was created by [[George Ashley Campbell]] in 1910 and marked the beginning of filter theory.  Campbell's filter was a lumped-element design of capacitors and inductors suggested by his work with [[loading coil]]s.  [[Otto Zobel]] and others quickly developed this further.&lt;ref&gt;Bray, page 62&lt;/ref&gt;  Development of distributed element filters began in the years before World War II. A major paper on the subject was published by [[Warren P. Mason|Mason]] and Sykes in 1937;&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levy &amp; Cohn, page 1055|See also Mason &amp; Sykes (1937)}}&lt;/ref&gt; a patent&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Warren P., "Wave filter", {{US patent|1781469}}, filed: {{Nowrap|25 June}} 1927, issued: {{Nowrap|11 November}} 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; filed by Mason in 1927 may contain the first published filter design using distributed elements.&lt;ref&gt;Millman ''et al.'', page 108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Bethe.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.55|alt=photo|[[Hans Bethe]] developed waveguide aperture theory.]]
Mason and Sykes' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and [[balanced pair]]s of wires, but other researchers later applied the principles to waveguides as well. Much development on waveguide filters was carried out during World War II driven by the filtering needs of radar and [[electronic countermeasure]]s. A good deal of this was at the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]] (Rad Lab), but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved such as the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] in the UK.  Amongst the well-known scientists and engineers at Rad Lab were [[Julian Schwinger]], [[Nathan Marcuvitz]], [[Edward Mills Purcell]], and [[Hans Bethe]].  Bethe was only at Rad Lab a short time but produced his aperture theory while there.  Aperture theory is important for waveguide cavity filters, which were first developed at Rad Lab.  Their work was published after the war in 1948 and includes an early description of dual-mode cavities by Fano and Lawson.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levy &amp; Cohn, pages 1055, 1057|See also Fano and Lawson (1948)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical work following the war included the commensurate line theory of [[Paul Richards (scientist)|Paul Richards]]. Commensurate lines are networks in which all the elements are the same length (or in some cases multiples of the unit length), although they may differ in other dimensions to give different characteristic impedances.{{glosslink|Z0|a}} [[Richards' transformation]] allows any lumped element design to be taken "as is" and transformed directly into a distributed element design using a very simple transform equation.  In 1955 K. Kuroda published the transformations known as [[Kuroda's identities]].  These made Richard's work more usable in [[unbalanced line|unbalanced]] and waveguide formats by eliminating the problematic [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] connected elements, but it was some time before Kuroda's Japanese work became widely known in the English speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levy and Cohn, pages 1056–1057|See also Richards (1948)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another theoretical development was the [[network synthesis filter]] approach of [[Wilhelm Cauer]] in which he used the [[Chebyshev approximation]] to determine element values.  Cauer's work was largely developed during World War II (Cauer was killed towards the end of it), but could not be widely published until hostilities ended.  While Cauer's work concerns lumped elements, it is of some importance to waveguide filters; the [[Chebyshev filter]], a special case of Cauer's synthesis, is widely used as a prototype filter for waveguide designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Cauer ''et al.'', pages 3, 5|Mansour, page 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designs in the 1950s started with a lumped element prototype (a technique still in use today), arriving after various transformations at the desired filter in a waveguide form.  At the time, this approach was yielding [[fractional bandwidth]]s no more than about {{sfrac|1|5}}.  In 1957, Leo Young at [[Stanford Research Institute]] published a method for designing filters which ''started'' with a distributed element prototype, the stepped impedance prototype.  This filter was based on [[quarter-wave impedance transformer]]s of various widths and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an [[Octave (electronics)|octave]] (a fractional bandwidth of {{sfrac|2|3}}).  Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levy &amp; Cohn, page 1056|See also Young (1963)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pierce cross-coupled filter.png|thumb|alt=drawing|'''Figure 3.'''  Pierce's waveguide implementation of a cross-coupled filter]]
The first published account of a [[cross-coupled filter]] is due to [[John R. Pierce]] at [[Bell Labs]] in a 1948 patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Pierce, J. R., "Guided wave frequency range transducer", {{US patent|2626990}}, filed: 4 May 1948, issued: 27 January 1953.|See also Pierce (1949)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A cross-coupled filter is one in which resonators that are not immediately adjacent are coupled.  The additional [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] thus provided allow the designer to create filters with improved performance, or, alternatively, with fewer resonators.  One version of Pierce's filter, shown in figure 3, uses circular waveguide cavity resonators to link between rectangular guide cavity resonators.  This principle was not at first much used by waveguide filter designers, but it was used extensively by [[mechanical filter]] designers in the 1960s, particularly R. A. Johnson at [[Collins Radio Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy &amp; Cohn, pages 1060–1061&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial non-military application of waveguide filters was in the [[microwave link]]s used by telecommunications companies to provide the [[backbone network|backbone]] of their networks.  These links were also used by other industries with large, fixed networks, notably television broadcasters.  Such applications were part of large capital investment programs.  They are now also used in [[satellite communications]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Hunter, page 230|Huurdeman, pages 369–371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for frequency-independent delay in satellite applications led to more research into the waveguide incarnation of cross-coupled filters.  Previously, satellite communications systems used a separate component for [[delay equalisation]].  The additional degrees of freedom obtained from cross-coupled filters held out the possibility of designing a flat delay into a filter without compromising other performance parameters.  A component that simultaneously functioned as both filter and equaliser would save valuable weight and space.  The needs of satellite communication also drove research into the more exotic resonator modes in the 1970s.  Of particular prominence in this respect is the work of E. L. Griffin and F. A. Young, who investigated better modes for the {{nowrap|12-14 GHz}} band when this began to be used for satellites in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levy &amp; Cohn, pages 1061–1062|See also Griffin &amp; Young (1978)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another space-saving innovation was the [[dielectric resonator]], which can be used in other filter formats as well as waveguide.  The first use of these in a filter was by S. B. Cohn in 1965, using [[titanium dioxide]] as the dielectric material.  Dielectric resonators used in the 1960s, however, had very poor temperature coefficients, typically 500 times worse than a mechanical resonator made of [[invar]], which led to instability of filter parameters.  Dielectric materials of the time with better temperature coefficients had too low a [[dielectric constant]] to be useful for space saving.  This changed with the introduction of ceramic resonators with very low temperature coefficients in the 1970s.  The first of these was from Massé and Pucel using [[barium tetratitanate]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Barium tetratitanate, BaTi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (Young ''et al.'', page 655)&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Raytheon]] in 1972.  Further improvements were reported in 1979 by Bell Labs and [[Murata Manufacturing]].  Bell Labs' [[barium nonatitanate]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Barium nonatitanate, Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; (Nalwa, page 443)&lt;/ref&gt; resonator had a dielectric constant of 40 and [[Q factor|''Q'']] of 5000–10,000 at {{nowrap|2-7 GHz}}.  Modern temperature-stable materials have a dielectric constant of about 90 at microwave frequencies, but research is continuing to find materials with both low loss and high permittivity; lower permittivity materials, such as [[zirconium stannate titanate]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Zirconium stannate titanate, Zr&lt;sub&gt;1−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Gusmano ''et al.'', page 690)&lt;/ref&gt; (ZST) with a dielectric constant of 38, are still sometimes used for their low loss property.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levy &amp; Cohn, pages 1062–1063|Nalwa, pages 525–526|See also:&lt;br /&gt;Maasé &amp; Pucel (1972)|Cohn (1965)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative approach to designing smaller waveguide filters was provided by the use of non-propagating evanescent modes. Jaynes and Edson proposed evanescent mode waveguide filters in the late 1950s. Methods for designing these filters were created by Craven and Young in 1966. Since then, evanescent mode waveguide filters have seen successful use where waveguide size or weight are important considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Wang, Li, and Lui (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively recent technology being used inside hollow-metal-waveguide filters is finline, a kind of planar dielectric waveguide.  Finline was first described by Paul Meier in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Srivastava &amp;Gupta, page 82|See also: Meier (1972)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplexer history===
[[File:John Robinson Pierce head.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.55|alt=photo|[[John R. Pierce]] invented the cross-coupled filter and the contiguous passband multiplexer.]]
[[Frequency-division multiplexing|Multiplexers]] were first described by Fano and Lawson in 1948.  Pierce was the first to describe multiplexers with contiguous passbands.  Multiplexing using directional filters was invented by Seymour Cohn and Frank Coale in the 1950s.  Multiplexers with compensating [[immittance]] resonators at each junction are largely the work of E. G. Cristal and G. L. Matthaei in the 1960s.  This technique is still sometimes used, but the modern availability of computing power has led to the more common use of synthesis techniques which can directly produce matching filters without the need for these additional resonators.  In 1965 R. J. Wenzel discovered that filters which were singly terminated,{{glosslink|1term|k}} rather than the usual doubly terminated, were complementary—exactly what was needed for a diplexer.{{glosslink|Dx|c}}  Wenzel was inspired by the lectures of circuit theorist [[Ernst Guillemin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levy &amp; Cohn, page 1065|See also:&lt;br /&gt;Fano &amp; Lawson (1948)|Pierce (1949)|Cristal &amp; Matthaei (1964)|Wenzel (1969)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multi-channel, multi-octave multiplexers were investigated by Harold Schumacher at Microphase Corporation, and his results were published in 1976.  The principle that multiplexer filters may be matched when joined together by modifying the first few elements, thus doing away with the compensating resonators, was discovered accidentally by E. J. Curly around 1968 when he mistuned a diplexer.  A formal theory for this was provided by J. D. Rhodes in 1976 and generalised to multiplexers by Rhodes and Ralph Levy in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levy &amp; Cohn, pages 1064–1065|See also:&lt;br&gt;Schumacher (1976)|Rhodes (1976)|Rhodes &amp; Levy (1979)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1980s, planar technologies, especially microstrip, have tended to replace other technologies used for constructing filters and multiplexers, especially in products aimed at the consumer market.  The recent innovation of post-wall waveguide allows waveguide designs to be implemented on a flat substrate with low-cost manufacturing techniques similar to those used for microstrip.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levy &amp; Cohn, page 1065|Xuan &amp; Kishk, page 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
[[File:Cauer lowpass.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|'''Figure 4.'''  Ladder circuit implementation of a lumped element low-pass filter]]
Waveguide filter designs frequently consist of two different components repeated a number of times.  Typically, one component is a resonator or discontinuity with a lumped circuit equivalent of an inductor, capacitor, or LC resonant circuit.  Often, the filter type will take its name from the style of this component.  These components are spaced apart by a second component, a length of guide which acts as an impedance transformer.  The impedance transformers have the effect of making alternate instances of the first component appear to be a different impedance.  The net result is a lumped element equivalent circuit of a ladder network.  Lumped element filters are commonly [[ladder topology]], and such a circuit is a typical starting point for waveguide filter designs.  Figure 4 shows such a ladder.  Typically, waveguide components are resonators, and the equivalent circuit would be [[LC circuit|LC resonators]] instead of the capacitors and inductors shown, but circuits like figure 4 are still used as [[prototype filter]]s with the use of a band-pass or band-stop transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 427–440&lt;/ref&gt;

Filter performance parameters, such as stopband rejection and rate of transition between passband and stopband, are improved by adding more components and thus increasing the length of the filter.  Where the components are repeated identically, the filter is an [[image parameter filter]] design, and performance is enhanced simply by adding more identical elements.  This approach is typically used in filter designs which use a large number of closely spaced elements such as the [[waffle-iron filter]].  For designs where the elements are more widely spaced, better results can be obtained using a network synthesis filter design, such as the common Chebyshev filter and [[Butterworth filter]]s.  In this approach the circuit elements do not all have the same value, and consequently the components are not all the same dimensions.  Furthermore, if the design is enhanced by adding more components then all the element values must be calculated again from scratch.  In general, there will be no common values between the two instances of the design.  Chebyshev waveguide filters are used where the filtering requirements are rigorous, such as satellite applications.&lt;ref name="Hunterpage"&gt;Hunter, page 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impedance transformer===
An impedance transformer is a device which makes an impedance at its output [[port (circuit theory)|port]] appear as a different impedance at its input port.  In waveguide, this device is simply a short length of waveguide.  Especially useful is the [[quarter-wave impedance transformer]] which has a length of λ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;/4.  This device can turn [[capacitance]]s into [[inductance]]s and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 144–145&lt;/ref&gt;  It also has the useful property of turning shunt-connected elements into series-connected elements and vice versa.  Series-connected elements are otherwise difficult to implement in waveguide.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 595–596&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reflections and discontinuities===
Many waveguide filter components work by introducing a sudden change, a discontinuity, to the transmission properties of the waveguide.  Such discontinuities are equivalent to lumped impedance elements placed at that point.  This arises in the following way: the discontinuity causes a partial reflection of the transmitted wave back down the guide in the opposite direction, the ratio of the two being known as the [[reflection coefficient]].  This is entirely analogous to a [[Reflections of signals on conducting lines|reflection on a transmission line]] where there is an established relationship between reflection coefficient and the impedance that caused the reflection.  This impedance must be [[electrical reactance|reactive]], that is, it must be a capacitance or an inductance.  It cannot be a resistance since no energy has been absorbed—it is all either transmitted onward or reflected.  Examples of components with this function include irises, stubs, and posts, all described later in this article under the filter types in which they occur.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery ''et al.'', page 162&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impedance step===
An impedance step is an example of a device introducing a discontinuity.  It is achieved by a step change in the physical dimensions of the waveguide.  This results in a step change in the characteristic impedance of the waveguide.  The step can be in either the [[E-plane]]{{glosslink|E-plane|f}} (change of height{{glosslink|height|j}}) or the [[H-plane]]{{glosslink|H-plane|g}} (change of width{{glosslink|height|i}}) of the waveguide.&lt;ref&gt;Das &amp; Das, pages 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resonant cavity filter==

===Cavity resonator===
A basic component of waveguide filters is the [[microwave cavity|cavity resonator]].  This consists of a short length of waveguide blocked at both ends.  Waves trapped inside the resonator are reflected back and forth between the two ends.  A given geometry of cavity will [[resonance|resonate]] at a characteristic frequency.  The resonance effect can be used to selectively pass certain frequencies.  Their use in a filter structure requires that some of the wave is allowed to pass out of one cavity into another through a coupling structure.  However, if the opening in the resonator is kept small then a valid design approach is to design the cavity as if it were completely closed and errors will be minimal.  A number of different coupling mechanisms are used in different classes of filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Hunter, pages 209–210|Matthaei ''et al.'', page 243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nomenclature for modes in a cavity introduces a third index, for example TE&lt;sub&gt;011&lt;/sub&gt;.  The first two indices describe the wave travelling up and down the length of the cavity, that is, they are the transverse mode numbers as for modes in a waveguide.  The third index describes the [[longitudinal mode]] caused by the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]] of the forward travelling and reflected waves.  The third index is equal to the number of half wavelengths down the length of the guide.  The most common modes used are the dominant modes: TE&lt;sub&gt;101&lt;/sub&gt; in rectangular waveguide, and TE&lt;sub&gt;111&lt;/sub&gt; in circular waveguide.  TE&lt;sub&gt;011&lt;/sub&gt; circular mode is used where very low loss (hence high ''Q'') is required but cannot be used in a dual-mode filter because it is circularly symmetric.  Better modes for rectangular waveguide in dual-mode filters are TE&lt;sub&gt;103&lt;/sub&gt; and TE&lt;sub&gt;105&lt;/sub&gt;.  However, even better is the TE&lt;sub&gt;113&lt;/sub&gt; circular waveguide mode which can achieve a ''Q'' of 16,000 at {{nowrap|12 GHz}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Connor, pages 100–101|Levy &amp; Cohn, page 1062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuning screw===
Tuning screws are screws inserted into resonant cavities which can be adjusted externally to the waveguide.  They provide fine tuning of the [[resonant frequency]] by inserting more, or less thread into the waveguide.  Examples can be seen in the post filter of figure 1: each cavity has a tuning screw secured with [[jam nut]]s and [[thread-locking compound]].  For screws inserted only a small distance, the equivalent circuit is a shunt capacitor, increasing in value as the screw is inserted.  However, when the screw has been inserted a distance λ/4 it resonates equivalent to a series LC circuit.  Inserting it further causes the impedance to change from capacitive to inductive, that is, the arithmetic sign changes.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery ''et al.'', pages 168–169&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iris===
[[File:Iris lumped equivalents.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|'''Figure 5.'''  Some waveguide iris geometries and their lumped element equivalent circuits]]
An iris is a thin metal plate across the waveguide with one or more holes in it.  It is used to couple together two lengths of waveguide and is a means of introducing a discontinuity.  Some of the possible geometries of irises are shown in figure 5.  An iris which reduces the width of a rectangular waveguide has an equivalent circuit of a shunt inductance, whereas one which restricts the height is equivalent to a shunt capacitance.  An iris which restricts both directions is equivalent to a parallel [[LC circuit|LC resonant circuit]].  A series LC circuit can be formed by spacing the conducting portion of the iris away from the walls of the waveguide.  Narrowband filters frequently use irises with small holes.  These are always inductive regardless of the shape of the hole or its position on the iris.  Circular holes are simple to machine, but elongated holes, or holes in the shape of a cross, are advantageous in allowing the selection of a particular mode of coupling.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Bagad, pages 3.41–3.44|Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 232–242|Montgomery ''et al.'', pages 162–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irises are a form of discontinuity and work by exciting evanescent higher modes.  Vertical edges are parallel to the electric field (E field) and excite TE modes.  The stored energy in TE modes is predominately in the magnetic field (H field), and consequently the lumped equivalent of this structure is an inductor.  Horizontal edges are parallel to the H field and excite TM modes.  In this case the stored energy is predominately in the E field and the lumped equivalent is a capacitor.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery ''et al.'', pages 162–179&lt;/ref&gt;

It is fairly simple to make irises that are mechanically adjustable.  A thin plate of metal can be pushed in and out of a narrow slot in the side of the waveguide.  The iris construction is sometimes chosen for this ability to make a variable component.&lt;ref&gt;Bagad, page 3.41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iris-coupled filter===
[[File:Iris coupled filter.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|'''Figure 6.''' Iris-coupled filter with three irises]]
An iris-coupled filter consists of a cascade of impedance transformers in the form of waveguide resonant cavities coupled together by irises.&lt;ref name="Hunterpage" /&gt;  In high power applications capacitive irises are avoided.  The reduction in height of the waveguide (the direction of the E field) causes the electric field strength across the gap to increase and arcing (or dielectric breakdown if the waveguide is filled with an insulator) will occur at a lower power than it would otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery ''et al.'', page 167&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post filter===
[[File:Post filter.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|'''Figure 7.''' Post filter with three rows of posts]]
Posts are conducting bars, usually circular, fixed internally across the height of the waveguide and are another means of introducing a discontinuity.  A thin post has an equivalent circuit of a shunt inductor.  A row of posts can be viewed as a form of inductive iris.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Bagad, pages 3.41–3.44|Hunter, pages 220–222|Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 453–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A post filter consists of several rows of posts across the width of the waveguide which separate the waveguide into resonant cavities as shown in figure 7.  Differing numbers of posts can be used in each row to achieve varying values of inductance.  An example can be seen in figure 1.  The filter operates in the same way as the iris-coupled filter but differs in the method of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Hunter, pages 220–228|Matthaei ''et al.'', page 540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-wall waveguide===
{{main article|Post-wall waveguide}}
A post-wall waveguide, or substrate integrated waveguide, is a more recent format that seeks to combine the advantages of low radiation loss, high ''Q'', and high power handling of traditional hollow metal pipe waveguide with the small size and ease of manufacture of planar technologies (such as the widely used microstrip format).  It consists of an insulated substrate pierced with two rows of conducting posts which stand in for the side walls of the waveguide.  The top and bottom of the substrate are covered with conducting sheets making this a similar construction to the [[triplate]] format.  The existing manufacturing techniques of [[printed circuit board]] or [[low temperature co-fired ceramic]] can be used to make post-wall waveguide circuits.  This format naturally lends itself to waveguide post filter designs.&lt;ref&gt;Xuan &amp; Kishk, pages 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dual-mode filter===
A dual-mode filter is a kind of resonant cavity filter, but in this case each cavity is used to provide two resonators by employing two modes (two polarizations), so halving the volume of the filter for a given order.  This improvement in size of the filter is a major advantage in aircraft [[avionics]] and space applications.  High quality filters in these applications can require many cavities which occupy significant space.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, pages 255–260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dielectric resonator filter==
[[File:Dielectric resonator waveguide filter.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|'''Figure 8.'''  Dielectric resonator filter with three transverse resonators]]

Dielectric resonators are pieces of [[dielectric]] material inserted into the waveguide.  They are usually cylindrical since these can be made without [[machining]] but other shapes have been used.  They can be made with a hole through the centre which is used to secure them to the waveguide.  There is no field at the centre when the TE&lt;sub&gt;011&lt;/sub&gt; circular mode is used so the hole has no adverse effect.  The resonators can be mounted coaxial to the waveguide, but usually they are mounted transversally across the width as shown in figure 8.  The latter arrangement allows the resonators to be tuned by inserting a screw through the wall of the waveguide into the centre hole of the resonator.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Nalwa, page 525|Jarry &amp; Beneat, page 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When dielectric resonators are made from a high [[permittivity]] material, such as one of the [[barium titanate]]s, they have an important space saving advantage compared to cavity resonators.  However, they are much more prone to spurious modes.  In high-power applications, metal layers may be built into the resonators to conduct heat away since dielectric materials tend to have low [[thermal conductivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Nalwa, pages 525–526|Jarry &amp; Beneat, page 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resonators can be coupled together with irises or impedance transformers.  Alternatively, they can be placed in a stub-like side-housing and coupled through a small aperture.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Nalwa, pages 525–526|Jarry &amp; Beneat, pages 10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insert filter===
[[File:E-plane insert filter.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|'''Figure 9.'''  Insert filter with six dielectric resonators in the E-plane.]]
In '''insert filters''' one or more metal sheets are placed longitudinally down the length of the waveguide as shown in figure 9.  These sheets have holes punched in them to form resonators.  The air dielectric gives these resonators a high ''Q''.  Several parallel inserts may be used in the same length of waveguide.  More compact resonators may be achieved with a thin sheet of dielectric material and printed metallisation instead of holes in metal sheets at the cost of a lower resonator ''Q''.&lt;ref&gt;Jarry &amp; Beneat, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finline filter===
[[Finline]] is a different kind of waveguide technology in which waves in a thin strip of dielectric are constrained by two strips of metallisation.  There are a number of possible topological arrangements of the dielectric and metal strips.  Finline is a variation of [[slot-waveguide]] but in the case of finline the whole structure is enclosed in a metal shield.  This has the advantage that, like hollow metal waveguide, no power is lost by radiation.  Finline filters can be made by printing a metallisation pattern on to a sheet of dielectric material and then inserting the sheet into the E-plane of a hollow metal waveguide much as is done with insert filters.  The metal waveguide forms the shield for the finline waveguide.  Resonators are formed by metallising a pattern on to the dielectric sheet.  More complex patterns than the simple insert filter of figure 9 are easily achieved because the designer does not have to consider the effect on mechanical support of removing metal.  This complexity does not add to the manufacturing costs since the number of processes needed does not change when more elements are added to the design.  Finline designs are less sensitive to manufacturing tolerances than insert filters and have wide bandwidths.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Jarry &amp; Beneat, page 12|Srivastava &amp; Gupta, pages&amp;nbsp;82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evanescent-mode filter==
It is possible to design filters that operate internally entirely in evanescent modes.  This has space saving advantages because the filter waveguide, which often forms the housing of the filter, does not need to be large enough to support propagation of the dominant mode.  Typically, an evanescent mode filter consists of a length of waveguide smaller than the waveguide feeding the input and output ports.  In some designs this may be folded to achieve a more compact filter.  Tuning screws are inserted at specific intervals along the waveguide producing equivalent lumped capacitances at those points.  In more recent designs the screws are replaced with dielectric inserts.  These capacitors resonate with the preceding length of evanescent mode waveguide which has the equivalent circuit of an inductor, thus producing a filtering action.  Energy from many different evanescent modes is stored in the field around each of these capacitive discontinuities.  However, the design is such that only the dominant mode reaches the output port; the other modes decay much more rapidly between the capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Jarry &amp; Beneat, pages 3–5|Golio, page 9.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corrugated-waveguide filter==
[[File:corrugated filter.png|thumb|alt=diagram|'''Figure 10.'''  Corrugated waveguide filter with cutaway showing the corrugations inside]]
[[File:Corrugated filter section.svg|thumb|alt=diagram|'''Figure 11.''' Longitudinal section through a corrugated waveguide filter]]
'''Corrugated-waveguide filters''', also called '''ridged-waveguide filters''', consist of a number of ridges, or teeth, that periodically reduce the internal height of the waveguide as shown in figures 10 and 11.  They are used in applications which simultaneously require a wide passband, good passband matching, and a wide stopband.  They are essentially low-pass designs (above the usual limitation of the cutoff frequency), unlike most other forms which are usually band-pass.  The distance between teeth is much smaller than the typical λ/4 distance between elements of other filter designs.  Typically, they are designed by the image parameter method with all ridges identical, but other classes of filter such as Chebyshev can be achieved in exchange for complexity of manufacture.  In the image design method the equivalent circuit of the ridges is modelled as a cascade of [[Constant k filter#Derivation|LC half sections]].  The filter operates in the dominant TE&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; mode, but spurious modes can be a problem when they are present.  In particular, there is little stopband attenuation of TE&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; and TE&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; modes.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 380–390&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waffle-iron filter===
{{main article|waffle-iron filter}}
The waffle-iron filter is a variant of the corrugated-waveguide filter.  It has similar properties to that filter with the additional advantage that spurious TE&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; and TE&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; modes are suppressed.  In the waffle-iron filter, channels are cut through the ridges longitudinally down the filter.  This leaves a matrix of teeth protruding internally from the top and bottom surfaces of the waveguide.  This pattern of teeth resembles a [[waffle iron]], hence the name of the filter.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 390–409&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waveguide stub filter==
[[File:Waveguide stub filter.png|thumb|alt=diagram|'''Figure 12.'''  Waveguide stub filter consisting of three stub resonators]]

A [[Stub (electronics)|stub]] is a short length of waveguide connected to some point in the filter at one end and short-circuited at the other end.  Open-circuited stubs are also theoretically possible, but an implementation in waveguide is not practical because electromagnetic energy would be launched out of the open end of the stub, resulting in high losses.  Stubs are a kind of resonator, and the lumped element equivalent is an LC resonant circuit.  However, over a narrow band, stubs can be viewed as an impedance transformer.  The short-circuit is transformed into either an inductance or a capacitance depending on the stub length.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Connor, pages 32–34|Radmanesh, pages 295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A waveguide stub filter is made by placing one or more stubs along the length of a waveguide, usually λ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;/4 apart, as shown in figure 12.  The ends of the stubs are blanked off to short-circuit them.&lt;ref&gt;Ke Wu ''et al.'', page 612&lt;/ref&gt;  When the short-circuited stubs are λ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;/4 long the filter will be a [[band-stop filter]] and the stubs will have a lumped-element approximate equivalent circuit of  parallel resonant circuits connected in series with the line.  When the stubs are λ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;/2 long, the filter will be a [[band-pass filter]].  In this case the lumped-element equivalent is series LC resonant circuits in series with the line.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 595–596, 726&lt;/ref&gt;

==Absorption filter==
'''Absorption filters''' dissipate the energy in unwanted frequencies internally as heat.  This is in contrast to a conventional filter design where the unwanted frequencies are reflected back from the input port of the filter.  Such filters are used where it is undesirable for power to be sent back towards the source.  This is the case with high power transmitters where returning power can be high enough to damage the transmitter.  An absorption filter may be used to remove transmitter [[spurious emission]]s such as [[harmonic]]s or spurious [[sideband]]s.  A design that has been in use for some time has slots cut in the walls of the feed waveguide at regular intervals.  This design is known as a '''leaky-wave filter'''.  Each slot is connected to a smaller gauge waveguide which is too small to support propagation of frequencies in the wanted band.  Thus those frequencies are unaffected by the filter.  Higher frequencies in the unwanted band, however, readily propagate along the side guides which are terminated with a matched load where the power is absorbed.  These loads are usually a wedge shaped piece of microwave absorbent material.&lt;ref&gt;Cristal, pages 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;  Another, more compact, design of absorption filter uses resonators with a lossy dielectric.&lt;ref&gt;Minakova &amp; Rud, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filter-like devices==
There are many applications of filters whose design objectives are something other than rejection or passing of certain frequencies.  Frequently, a simple device that is intended to work over only a narrow band or just one spot frequency will not look much like a filter design.  However, a [[broadband]] design for the same item requires many more elements and the design takes on the nature of a filter.  Amongst the more common applications of this kind in waveguide are [[impedance matching]] networks, [[power dividers and directional couplers|directional couplers, power dividers, power combiners]], and [[diplexer]]s.  Other possible applications include [[multiplexer]]s, demultiplexers, [[negative-resistance amplifier]]s, and [[Bessel filter|time-delay networks]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 1–13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impedance matching===
[[File:Orthomode transducer.jpg|thumb|alt=photo|'''Figure 13'''. An [[orthomode transducer]] (a variety of [[duplexer]]) incorporating stepped impedance matching]]
A simple method of impedance matching is [[stub matching]] with a single stub.  However, a single stub will only produce a perfect match at one particular frequency.  This technique is therefore only suitable for narrow band applications.  To widen the bandwidth multiple stubs may be used, and the structure then takes on the form of a stub filter.  The design proceeds as if it were a filter except that a different parameter is optimised.  In a frequency filter typically the parameter optimised is stopband rejection, passband attenuation, steepness of transition, or some compromise between these.  In a matching network the parameter optimised is the impedance match.  The function of the device does not require a restriction of bandwidth, but the designer is nevertheless forced to choose a bandwidth because of the ''structure'' of the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Connor, pages 32–34|Matthaei ''et al.'', page 701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stubs are not the only format of filter than can be used.  In principle, any filter structure could be applied to impedance matching, but some will result in more practical designs than others.  A frequent format used for impedance matching in waveguide is the stepped impedance filter.  An example can be seen in the duplexer{{glosslink|Dx|e}} pictured in figure 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Das &amp; Das, pages 131–136|Matthaei ''et al.'', Chapter 6 (pages 255–354)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directional couplers and power combiners===
[[File:Multi-hole waveguide coupler.png|thumb|alt=drawing|'''Figure 14.''' A multi-hole waveguide coupler]]
Directional couplers, power splitters, and power combiners  are all essentially the same type of device, at least when implemented with [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] components.  A directional coupler splits a small amount of power from the main line to a third port.  A more strongly coupled, but otherwise identical, device may be called a power splitter.  One that couples exactly half the power to the third port (a {{nowrap|3 dB}} coupler) is the maximum coupling achievable without reversing the functions of the ports.  Many designs of power splitter can be used in reverse, whereupon they become power combiners.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, page 193, 201&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple form of directional coupler is two parallel transmission lines coupled together over a λ/4 length.  This design is limited because the [[electrical length]] of the coupler will only be λ/4 at one specific frequency.  Coupling will be a maximum at this frequency and fall away on either side.  Similar to the impedance matching case, this can be improved by using multiple elements, resulting in a filter-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', page 776&lt;/ref&gt;  A waveguide analogue of this coupled lines approach is the [[Bethe-hole directional coupler]] in which two parallel waveguides are stacked on top of each other and a hole provided for coupling.  To produce a wideband design, multiple holes are used along the guides  as shown in figure 14 and a filter design applied.&lt;ref&gt;Ishii, pages 205–206, 212,213&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not only the coupled-line design that suffers from being narrow band, all simple designs of waveguide coupler depend on frequency in some way.  For instance the [[rat-race coupler]] (which can be implemented directly in waveguide) works on a completely different principle but still relies on certain lengths being exact in terms of λ.&lt;ref&gt;Bagad, page 4.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplexers and duplexers===

A diplexer is a device used to combine two signals occupying different frequency bands into a single signal.  This is usually to enable two signals to be transmitted simultaneously on the same communications channel, or to allow transmitting on one frequency while receiving on another. (This specific use of a diplexer is called a duplexer.) The same device can be used to separate the signals again at the far end of the channel.  The need for filtering to separate the signals while receiving is fairly self-evident but it is also required even when combining two transmitted signals.  Without filtering, some of the power from source A will be sent towards source B instead of the combined output.  This will have the detrimental effects of losing a portion of the input power and loading source A with the [[output impedance]] of source B thus causing mismatch.  These problems could be overcome with the use of a {{nowrap|3 dB}} directional coupler, but as explained in the previous section, a wideband design requires a filter design for directional couplers as well.&lt;ref&gt;Maloratsky, pages 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;

Two widely spaced narrowband signals can be diplexed by joining together the outputs of two appropriate band-pass filters.  Steps need to be taken to prevent the filters from coupling to each other when they are at resonance which would cause degradation of their performance.  This can be achieved by appropriate spacing.  For instance, if the filters are of the iris-coupled type then the iris nearest to the filter junction of filter A is placed λ&lt;sub&gt;gb&lt;/sub&gt;/4 from the junction where λ&lt;sub&gt;gb&lt;/sub&gt; is the guide wavelength in the passband of filter B.  Likewise, the nearest iris of filter B is placed λ&lt;sub&gt;ga&lt;/sub&gt;/4 from the junction.  This works because when filter A is at resonance, filter B is in its stopband and only loosely coupled and vice versa.  An alternative arrangement is to have each filter joined to a main waveguide at separate junctions.  A decoupling resonator is placed λ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;/4 from the junction of each filter.  This can be in the form of a short-circuited stub tuned to the resonant frequency of that filter.  This arrangement can be extended to multiplexers with any number of bands.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 969–973&lt;/ref&gt;

For diplexers dealing with contiguous passbands proper account of the [[crossover filter|crossover]] characteristics of filters needs to be considered in the design.  An especially common case of this is where the diplexer is used to split the entire spectrum into low and high bands.  Here a low-pass and a high-pass filter are used instead of band-pass filters.  The synthesis techniques used here can equally be applied to narrowband multiplexers and largely remove the need for decoupling resonators.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levy &amp; Cohn, page 1065|Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 991–992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directional filters===
[[File:Waveguide directional filter.png|thumb|upright|alt=diagram|'''Figure 15'''.  A waveguide directional filter cut away to show the circular waveguide irises]]
A directional filter is a device that combines the functions of a directional coupler and a diplexer.  As it is based on a directional coupler it is essentially a four-port device, but like directional couplers, port 4 is commonly permanently terminated internally.  Power entering port 1 exits port 3 after being subject to some filtering function (usually band-pass).  The remaining power exits port 2, and since no power is absorbed or reflected this will be the exact complement of the filtering function at port 2, in this case band-stop.  In reverse, power entering ports 2 and 3 is combined at port 1, but now the power from the signals rejected by the filter is absorbed in the load at port 4.  Figure 15 shows one possible waveguide implementation of a directional filter.  Two rectangular waveguides operating in the dominant TE&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; mode provide the four ports.  These are joined together by a circular waveguide operating in the circular TE&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; mode.  The circular waveguide contains an iris coupled filter with as many irises as needed to produce the required filter response.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pages 843–847&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Winaero''' is a website hosting freeware tweaking tools for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is operated by Russian developer, Sergey Tkachenko. The website sports 50+ freeware tools for modifying the behavior of Microsoft Windows. Notable amongst these are Skip Metro Suite &lt;ref&gt;[http://betanews.com/2012/08/20/skip-metro-suite-bypasses-the-windows-8-start-screen/ Skip Metro Suite bypasses the Windows 8 Start screen - BetaNews]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.103 Skip Metro Suite]&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed skipping the Windows 8 Start screen, booting straight to the Windows desktop and customizing the Modern UI hot corners. Other notable tools include Ribbon Disabler,&lt;ref&gt;[http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.20 Ribbon Disabler]&lt;/ref&gt; which allows disabling the Explorer [[Ribbon (computing)|Ribbon interface]] and Personalization Panel&lt;ref&gt;[http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.4 Personalization Panel]&lt;/ref&gt; which replicates the full personalization restricted by low end editions of Windows. The latest addition is Winaero Tweaker which unifies most of the tools under a single tool to modify hidden Windows settings.

The website also regularly gives tips on tweaking Windows through its blog and offers free themes, visual styles and HD wallpapers to customize Windows.

Winaero posts daily topics ranging from tweaks and tips for Windows,&lt;ref&gt;[http://winaero.com/blog/category/windows-8-1/ Windows 8.1 Tips]&lt;/ref&gt; to troubleshooting guides, to free visual styles and theme packs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winaero.com/blog/category/windows-8-themepacks/ Windows 8 Themepacks]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and blogging==
The developer and founder of Winaero is Sergey Tkachenko.

The '''World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)''' is a [[CEO]]-led organization of over 200 [[multinational company|international companies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/About-us|title=About us|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Council is also connected to 60 national and regional buisness councils and partner organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geneve-int.ch/world-business-council-sustainable-development-wbcsd-0|title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development - WBCSD {{!}} Genève Internationale|website=www.geneve-int.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Its origins date back to the Rio de Janeiro [[Earth Summit]] of 1992,&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt; when [[Stephan Schmidheiny]], a Swiss business entrepreneur, was appointed chief adviser for business and industry to the secretary general of the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memo to Rio+20: 'green economy' doesn't mean monetising nature|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/29/rio-20-green-economy-monetising-nature|website=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created a forum called "Business Council for Sustainable Development", which went on to become ''Changing Course'', a book that coined the concept of [[eco-efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eco-Efficiency|url=http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/business/ecoeffic.shtml|website=www.smartcommunities.ncat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WBCSD was created in 1995 in a merger of the Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Industry Council for the Environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= THE ICC &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT|url=http://archive.corporateeurope.org/icc/icc_environment.html|website=archive.corporateeurope.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based at the [[Maison de la paix]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/globalwarming/n721.xml|website=knowledge.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offices in New York and New Delhi.

==Operations==
The Council works on a variety of issues related to sustainable development. It works to achieve the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) through the transformation of six economic systems. These are Circular Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Circular-Economy|title=Circular Economy - World business council for sustainable development|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Cities and Mobility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Cities-and-Mobility|title=Cities and Mobility|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Climate and Energy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Climate-and-Energy|title=Energy &amp; Circular Economy|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Food, Land and Water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Food-Land-Water|title=Food, Land &amp; Water|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, People&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/People|title=People|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Redefining Value&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Redefining-Value|title=Redefining Value|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each system transformation is set up as a WBCSD Program with a number of supplementary Projects&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.wbcsd.org/2018/11/Value.Impact.Voice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Impact and influence==
A 2003 [[World Bank]]/[[International Finance Corporation|IFC]] commissioned study  identified the WBCSD as one of the "most influential forums" for companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resourcesaver.org/file/toolmanager/CustomO16C45F49313.pdf Race to the Top: Attracting and Enabling Global Sustainable Business]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 [[Globescan]] survey found the WBCSD as the second most effective SD research organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://surveys.globescan.com/sdroleaders/sose04-2_resorg.pdf 2004 Globescan Survey of Sustainability Experts]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2006 survey by the same company reports that 54% of all surveyed experts believe the WBCSD will play a "major role" in advancing sustainable development. Only the European Union received higher approval (69%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpi.cam.ac.uk/PDF/Aug%202006.pdf Cambridge Sustainability Research Digest]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2007's [[Ethisphere Institute]] list of the 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, WBCSD President Bjoern Stigson has been ranked 9th, which made him the 2nd most influential NGO leader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethisphere.com/influential/ 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210162230/http://ethisphere.com/influential/ |date=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership of the WBCSD is by invitation of the Executive Committee to companies committed to [[sustainable development]]. Among its over 180 members&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members&lt;/ref&gt; are well-known companies such as [[DuPont]], [[3M]], [[Nestlé]], [[BP]], [[Danone]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. WBCSD provides its members with the '''value, impact and voice''' to navigate unprecedented global changes and allows them to prosper from transforming their operations. By joining the WBCSD, member companies benefit from insights into the latest knowledge on sustainability, sustainability tools, peer collaboration across the value chain, participation in policy development and a chance to profile their sustainability work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members|title=Our members|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Member companies pledge their support and contribution to the WBCSD by making available their knowledge and experience, and appropriate human resources. They are asked to publicly report on their environmental performance and to aspire to widen their reporting to cover all three pillars of sustainable development - economic, social and environmental.

A key element is the personal commitment of the [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officers]] (CEOs), acting as Council Members. They are influential advocates for the WBCSD’s policy positions and they co-chair the working groups. They also organize support for the WBCSD’s work program and ensure the adoption of sustainable management practices within their companies.

===Forética===
Forética claims to be global network of [[Spanish language|Spanish speaking]] businesses and professionals whose mission is to promote an ethical management and corporate social responsibility by the establishment of a National standard in Spain known as SGE-21, (sistema de gestación ética para siglo 21) which is also Annex 1 to [[ISO 26000]] and supported by [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] Europe &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csr-supplychain.org/ CSR Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;
Membership is said to around 400 and includes companies of all sizes and sectors, as well as individual specialists, professionals and academics and it was incorporated into WBCSD on 2 September 2014 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org/Pages/eNews/eNewsDetails.aspx?ID=16293&amp;NoSearchContextKey=true Leading Spanish think-tank Forética joins WBCSD’s Global Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographically least represented regions are Africa, Australasia and the Middle East with 1% each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members|title=Our members|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

According to Greenpeace the ''World Business Council for Sustainable Development '' is among the key players responsible for holding the world societies from tackling the [[climate change]] and energy management challenges for the past 20 years. The WBCSD Executive Committee was dominated by the largest nonrenewable energy and carbon-intensive companies in the world at least until 2011. According to Greenpeace the WBCSD executive committee has been a ‘Who’s Who’ of the world’s largest carbon-intensive companies.&lt;ref name=GP2010&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/391%20-%20WhosHoldingUsBack.pdf Who's holding us back?Full report] November 23, 2011 page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sierra Club]] has collaborated with the World Business Council on a number of initiatives, as well as inviting its representatives to speak at Sierra Club events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/rocky-mountain-chapter/calendar-2 |title=Calendar &amp;#124; Sierra Club |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austineconetwork.com/content/austin-sierra-club-monthly-meeting |title=Austin Sierra Club monthly meeting &amp;#124; Austin EcoNetwork |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Environmental Defense Fund]] recommends the World Business Council's auditing methods to companies seeking to reduce greenhouse emissions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/GHG_roadmap_Final.pdf |title=www.edf.org |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] has drawn upon WBCSD guidelines in drawing up their own guidelines for determining biofuels sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/energy/files/biofuels-sustainability-certification-report.pdf |title=Biofuel Sustainability Performance Guidelines |accessdate=2015-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WBCSC's Vision 2020 report was highlighted by [[The Guardian]] as "the largest concerted corporate sustainability action plan to date – include reversing the damage done to ecosystems, addressing rising greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring societies move to sustainable agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-case-studies-world-business-council |title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development: Vision 2050 &amp;#124; Guardian Sustainable Business &amp;#124; The Guardian |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
