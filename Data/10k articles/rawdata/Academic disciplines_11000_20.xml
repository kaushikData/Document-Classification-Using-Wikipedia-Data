      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5490">'''Academic detailing''' is “[[university]] or [[non-commercial]]-based educational outreach.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soumerai SB, Avorn J | year = 1990 | title = Principles of educational outreach ('academic detailing') to improve clinical decision making | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 263 | issue = 4| pages = 549–56 | doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03440040088034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process involves face-to-face education of prescribers by trained [[health care]] professionals, typically [[pharmacists]], [[physicians]], or [[nurses]]. The goal of academic detailing is to improve prescribing of targeted [[drugs]] to be consistent with [[medical]] evidence from [[randomized controlled trials]], which ultimately improves patient care and can reduce [[health care costs]]. A key component of non-commercial or university-based academic detailing programs is that they (academic detailers/clinical educators, management, staff, program developers, etc.) do not have any financial links to the [[pharmaceutical industry]].

Academic detailing has been studied for over 25 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Avorn J, Soumerai SB | year = 1983 | title = Improving drug-therapy decisions through educational outreach. A [[randomized controlled trial]] of academically based "detailing | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 308 | issue = 24| pages = 1457–63 | doi=10.1056/nejm198306163082406}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been shown to be effective at improving prescribing of targeted medications about 5% from baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Brien MA, Rogers S, Jamtvedt G | year = 2007 | title = Educational outreach visits: effects on professional practice and health care outcomes | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd000409.pub2 | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 4 | issue = | page = CD000409 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though it is primarily used to affect prescribing, it is also used to educate providers regarding other [[non-drug intervention]]s, such as [[screening guideline]]s.

== Organizations ==
Many academic detailing programs exist around the world. In the [[United States]], university-based state programs exist in [[Vermont]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.med.uvm.edu/ahec/TB1+BL.asp?SiteAreaID=290&lt;/ref&gt; Oregon&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110720024858/http://pharmacy.oregonstate.edu/drug_policy/index.php?nav=ROAD&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sccp.sc.edu/SCORxE&lt;/ref&gt;  The nonprofit organization Alosa Health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alosahealth.org/|title=Alosa Health|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; runs an academic detailing program in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Washington, DC called the Independent Drug Information Service (IDIS). The National Resource Center for Academic Detailing (NaRCAD), funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in 2010, was created to help organizations with limited resources to establish and improve their own programs and to create a network of academic detailing programs. The [[U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]] Pharmacy Benefits Management pilot tested the National Academic Detailing Service in 2010 to enhance veterans' outcomes by empowering clinicians and promoting the use of evidence-based treatments using delivered by clinical pharmacy specialists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbm.va.gov/PBM/academicdetailingservice/AboutUs.asp (Last accessed: 20 October 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; After the pilot, in March 2015, the Interim Under Secretary for Health issued a memorandum requiring implementation of AD programs throughout the [[Veterans Health Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.veterans.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/VA%20Clancy%20Testimony%203.26.20151.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs also exist in [[Canada]] through the [[Canadian Academic Detailing Collaboration (CADC)]],&lt;ref&gt;http://ebm.oscarmcmaster.org/ebm-resources/CADC%20Handout%202008.doc&lt;/ref&gt; including the [https://effectivepractice.org Centre for Effective Practice]'s (CEP) [https://effectivepractice.org/resources/academic-detailing-service/ academic detailing service] in Ontario,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Margaret|last2=Naumann|first2=Terryn|last3=Regier|first3=Loren|last4=Bugden|first4=Shawn|last5=Allen|first5=Michael|last6=Salach|first6=Lena|last7=Chelak|first7=Kristen|last8=Blythe|first8=Nancy|last9=Gagnon|first9=Antony|date=May 2012|title=A brief overview of academic detailing in Canada: Another role for pharmacists|journal=Canadian Pharmacists Journal : CPJ|volume=145|issue=3|pages=142–146.e2|doi=10.3821/145.3.cpj142|issn=1715-1635|pmc=3567505|pmid=23509530}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australia]] through the [[Drug and Therapeutics Information Service]] (DATIS) and the [[National Prescribing Service]] (NPS).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">The '''Antwerp School''' was a school of artists active in [[Antwerp]], first during the 16th century when the city was the economic center of the [[Low Countries]], and then during the 17th century when it became the artistic stronghold of the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] under [[Peter Paul Rubens]].

==History==
Antwerp took over from [[Bruges]] as the main trading and commercial center of the [[Low Countries]] around 1500. Painters, artists and craftsmen joined the [[Guild of Saint Luke]], which educated apprentices and guaranteed quality.

The first school of artists that emerged in the city were the [[Antwerp Mannerism|Antwerp Mannerists]], a group of anonymous late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] painters active in the city from about 1500 to 1520. They were followed by [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painters in the Italian tradition that developed at the end of the [[High Renaissance]]. [[Jan Gossaert]] was a major artist in the city at this time. Other artists, such as [[Frans Floris]], continued this style.

The [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] riots ('[[Beeldenstorm]]' in Dutch) of 1566 that preceded the [[Dutch Revolt]] resulted in the destruction of many works of religious art, after which time the churches and monasteries had to be refurnished and redecorated. Artists such as [[Otto van Veen]] and members of the [[Francken]] family, working in a late mannerist style, provided new religious decoration. It also marked a beginning of economic decline in the city, as the [[Scheldt]] river was blockaded by the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1585 diminishing trade.

[[File:Paul de Vos, Ark van Noah.jpg|thumb|left|Paul de Vos, ''Ark van Noah'']]The city experienced an artistic renewal in the 17th century. The large workshops of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jacob Jordaens]], and the influence of [[Anthony van Dyck]], made Antwerp the center of the Flemish Baroque.  The city was an internationally significant publishing centre, and had a huge production of [[old master print]]s and book illustrations.  Antwerp ''[[animalier]]s'' or animal painters, such as [[Frans Snyders]], [[Jan Fyt]] and [[Paul de Vos]] dominated this speciality in Europe for at least the first half of the century.  Many artists joined the [[Guild of Romanists]], a society for which having visited Rome was a condition of membership. But as the economy continued to decline, and the [[Habsburg]] Governors and the Church reduced their patronage, many artists trained in Antwerp left for the Netherlands, England, France or elsewhere, and by the end of the 17th century Antwerp was no longer a major centre for art.

The artistic legacy of Antwerp is represented in many museums, and paintings of the Antwerp School are valued at [[auction]]s.

The '''Astrophysics Research Institute''' ('''ARI''') is an [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]] research institute located in [[Merseyside]], UK. Formed in 1992, the institute was situated on the [[Twelve Quays]] site in [[Birkenhead]] from 1998 to 2013, until in June 2013 the institute relocated to the Liverpool Science Park in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukspa.org.uk/news/member_news/content/3853/astrophysics_research_institute_joins_liverpool_science_park |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130707081939/http://www.ukspa.org.uk/news/member_news/content/3853/astrophysics_research_institute_joins_liverpool_science_park |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2013 |title=Astrophysics Research Institute Joins Liverpool Science Park |accessdate=4 June 2013 |publisher=United Kingdom Science Park Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/NewsUpdate/viewarticle/803/All |title= Astrophysics is moving |accessdate= 7 June 2013 |date= 31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is in the top 1% of institutions in the field of [[space science]] as measured by total [[citation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.in-cites.com/institutions/LivplJhnMoresU-AstrphyResIns.html |title= An interview with: Liverpool John Moores University, Astrophysics Research Institute |date= March 2007 |accessdate= 7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently over 90 staff members and research students working at the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/people |title= Staff at the Astrophysics Research Institute |accessdate= 27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which lies within the administration of the [[Liverpool John Moores University]]'s Faculty of Engineering and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology |title= LJMU Faculty of Engineering and Technology |accessdate= 27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Conducted research varies into many areas of astronomy and astrophysics, such as [[supernova]]e, [[star formation]] and [[galaxy clusters]]. Research is funded by external organisations, such as the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stfc.ac.uk/gow/Sm/grls.asp?cx=01&amp;sc=0&amp;so=oa&amp;in=166&amp;nv=0102&amp;dp=15843 |title=STFC Grants on the Web: Institution analysis |publisher=Stfc.ac.uk |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2012-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319220439/http://www.stfc.ac.uk/GOW/Sm/grls.asp?cx=01&amp;sc=0&amp;so=oa&amp;in=166&amp;nv=0102&amp;dp=15843 |archivedate=19 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/aboutari |title=Astrophysics Research Institute - Liverpool John Moores University |publisher=Astro.ljmu.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute maintains the [[Liverpool Telescope]] which is located on the island of [[La Palma]] in the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/ | title = Liverpool Telescope | accessdate = 2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The institute currently teaches two undergraduate courses: a 3-year [[Bachelor of Science|BSc (Hons)]] in Physics and Astronomy, as well as a 4-year [[Master of Physics|MPhys (Hons)]] in Astrophysics. Both the undergraduate courses are taught as a [[Double degree|joint degree]] by the Astrophysics Research Institute of [[Liverpool John Moores University]] and the Department of Physics at the [[University of Liverpool]]. The courses are accredited by the [[Institute of Physics]].

Postgraduate courses are made available at [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] and [[Master of Science|Master's]] level, with two MSc courses taught via [[distance learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.astronomy.ac.uk/msc | title = Astrophysics MSc | accessdate = 2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unaccredited short courses are also made available to those who do not have a scientific or mathematical background. The Astronomy by Distance Learning courses are taught by CD-ROM, DVD and website material without the need for classroom sessions. Each of the courses provides an introduction into astronomy as well as specialist areas such as [[supernova]]e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.astronomy.ac.uk/info/index | title = Courses | accessdate = 2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2006, the institute received the "''[[Queen's Anniversary Prize]]''" for higher education in recognition for its development of the robotic telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/4717744.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Merseyside &amp;#124; Royal recognition for university |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2006-02-15 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the "''[[Times Higher Education|Times Higher Education Supplement Award]]''" for 'project of the year' was given for the use of RINGO [[Polarimeter|optical polarimeter]] at the [[Liverpool Telescope]] in measuring [[gamma-ray bursts]]. RINGO has since been decommissioned and an updated polarimeter named RINGO2 is since in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/News/Archive/index.php?sf=s20071205 |title=The Liverpool Telescope: News : Archive : s20071205 |publisher=Telescope.livjm.ac.uk |date=2007-12-05 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1962 [[Douglas C. Engelbart]] released the report "Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html|title = Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework|date = October 1962|accessdate = 2015-04-20|website = SRI Summary Report AFOSR-3223 • Prepared for: Director of Information Sciences, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Washington DC, Contract AF 49(638)-1024 • SRI Project No. 3578 (AUGMENT,3906,).|publisher = [[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|last = Engelbart|first = Douglas C|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110504035147/http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html|archive-date = 2011-05-04|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced, and laid the groundwork for, augmented cognition. In this paper, Engelbart defines "augmenting human intellect"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; as "increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Modern augmented cognition began to emerge in the early 2000s. Advances in cognitive, behavioral, and neurological sciences during the 1990s set the stage for the emerging field of augmented cognition – this period has been termed the "[[Decade of the Brain]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Major advancements in [[functional magnetic resonance imaging |functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]] and [[electroencephalography|electroencephalography (EEG)]] have been pivotal in the emergence of augmented cognition technologies which seek to monitor the user's cognitive abilities. As these tools were primarily used in controlled environments, their further development was essential to pragmatic augmented cognition applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Research ==

=== DARPA's Augmented Cognition Program ===
The [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] has been one of the primary funding agencies for augmented cognition investigators. A major focus of DARPA's augmented cognition program (AugCog) has been developing more robust tools for monitoring cognitive state and integrating them with computer systems. The program envisions "order of magnitude increases in available, net thinking power resulting from linked human-machine dyads [that] will provide such clear informational superiority that few rational individuals or organizations would challenge under the consequences of mortality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Introduction|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327590ijhc1702_1|journal = International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction|date = June 1, 2004|access-date = 2015-04-19|issn = 1044-7318|pages = 127–130|volume = 17|issue = 2|doi = 10.1207/s15327590ijhc1702_1|first = Dylan|last = Schmorrow|first2 = Dennis|last2 = McBride}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cummings | first1 = M.

The program began in 2001, and has since be renamed to Improving Warfighter Information Intake Under Stress Program.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (US) Committee on Opportunities in Neuroscience for Future Army Applications. Opportunities in Neuroscience for Future Army Applications. Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2009. Appendix D, Research on Managing Information Overload in Soldiers Under Stress. Available from:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207983/&lt;/ref&gt; By leveraging such tools, the program seeks to provide warfighters with enhanced cognitive abilities, especially under complex or stressful war conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As of 2002, the program vision is divided into four phases:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Phase 1: Real-time cognitive state detection
* Phase 2: Real-time cognitive state manipulation
* Phase 3: Autonomous cognitive state manipulation
* Phase 4: Operation demonstration and transition
Proof of concept was carried out in two phases: near real time monitoring of the user's cognitive activity, and subsequent manipulation of the user's cognitive state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Augmented Cognition International (ACI) Society ===
The Augmented Cognition International (ACI) Society held its first conference in July 2005.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At the society's first conference, attendees from a diverse background including academia, government, and industry came together to create an agenda for future research. The agenda focused on near-, medium-, and long-term research and development goals in key augmented cognition science and technology areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The International Conference on Human Computer Interaction, where the society first established itself, continues to host the society's activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://2014.hci.international/vamr|title = Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality|date = 2014|accessdate = 19 April 2015|website = HCI International|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Translation engines ===
Thad Starner, and the [[American Sign Language|American Sign Language (ASL)]] Research Group at Georgia Tech, have been researching systems for the recognition of ASL. Telesign,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://research.cc.gatech.edu/ccg/?q=projects/telesign|title = Telesign|date = 2015-04-19|accessdate = 2015-04-19|website = Telesign|publisher = Georgia Tech Contextual Computing Group|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; a one-way translation system from ASL to [[English language|English]], was shown to have a 94% accuracy rate on a vocabulary with 141 signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/1853/28993|title = Towards a One-Way American Sign Language Translator|last = |first = |date = May 2004|journal = Sixth IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, 2004.

== Controversy ==

=== Privacy concerns ===
The increasing sophistication of brain-reading technologies has led many to investigate their potential applications for lie detection. Legally required brain scans arguably violate “the guarantee against self-incrimination” because they differ from acceptable forms of bodily evidence, such as fingerprints or blood samples, in an important way: they are not simply physical, hard evidence, but evidence that is intimately linked to the defendant's mind. Under US law, brain-scanning technologies might also raise implications for the Fourth Amendment, calling into question whether they constitute an unreasonable search and seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neuroscience, Ethics, and National Security: The State of the Art|last = Tennison|first = Michael|date = March 2012|journal = PLOS Biology |doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001289|pmid = 22448146|last2 = Moreno|first2 = Jonathon |pmc=3308927|volume=10|pages=e1001289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human augmentation ===
Many of the same arguments in the debate around [[human enhancement]] can be analogized to augmented cognition. Economic inequality, for instance, may serve to exacerbate societal advantages and disadvantages due to the limited availability of such technologies.

Fearing the potential applications of devices like Google Glass, certain gambling establishments (such as Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas) banned its use even before it was commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/08/google-glass-violates-nevada-law-says-caesars-palace|title = Google Glass Violates Nevada Law, Says Caesars Palace|date = May 8, 2013|accessdate = |website = IGN|publisher = |last = Clark|first = Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29914">Formerly known as the '''World Life Issues on Environment and Development''' (WCED), the mission of the '''Brundtland Commission''' is to unite countries to pursue [[sustainable development]] together. The Chairperson of the Commission, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], was appointed by [[United Nations]] [[UNSG|Secretary-General]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] in December 1983. At the time, the [[UN General Assembly]] realized that there was a heavy deterioration of the human environment and natural resources. To rally countries to work and pursue sustainable development together, the UN decided to establish the '''Brundtland Commission'''. Gro Harlem Brundtland was the former [[Prime Minister of Norway]] and was chosen due to her strong background in the sciences and [[public health]]. The Brundtland Commission officially dissolved in December 1987 after releasing ''[[Our Common Future]]'', also known as the ''[[Our Common Future|Brundtland Report]]'', in October 1987. The document popularized (and defined) the term 
"[[Sustainable Development]]". ''[[Our Common Future]]'' won the [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=grawemeyer.org&gt;{{cite web|title=1991- The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development|url=http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1991-the-united-nations-world-commission-on-environment-and-development.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103112536/http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1991-the-united-nations-world-commission-on-environment-and-development.html|archivedate=2013-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization Center for Our Common Future was started in April 1988 to take the place of the Commission.

==History==
Ten years after the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], a number of global environmental challenges had clearly not been adequately addressed.  In several ways, these challenges had grown. Particularly, the underlying problem of how to reduce poverty in low-income countries through more productive and industrialized economy without, in the process, exacerbating the global and local environmental burdens, remained unresolved. Neither high-income countries in the North nor low-income countries in the South were willing to give up an economic development based on growth, but environmental threats, ranging from pollution, acid rain, deforestation and desertification, the destruction of the ozone layer, to early signs of climate change, were impossible to overlook and increasingly unacceptable. There was a tangible need for a developmental concept that would allow reconciling economic development with [[environmental protection]]. Views differed on several questions: were local environmental problems the result of local developments or of a global economic system that forced particularly low-income countries to destroy their environmental basis? Did environmental burdens result mainly from destructive economic growth-based development or from a lack of economic development and modernization? Would reconciling the economy and the environment require mainly technical means by using more resource-efficient technologies or mainly social and structural changes that would include political decision-making as well as changes in private consumption patterns?
The 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]], was the first report that included a very brief chapter on a concept called "sustainable development". It focused on global structural changes and was not widely read. The UN initiated an independent commission, which was asked to provide an analysis of existing problems and ideas for their solution, similar to earlier commissions such as the Independent Commission on International Development Issues (Brandt Commission) and the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues (Palme Commission).&lt;ref&gt;Iris Borowy, Defining Sustainable Development: the World Commission on Environment and Development (Brundtland Commission), Milton Park: earthscan/Routledge, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1983, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], asked the Prime Minister of Norway, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], to create an organization independent of the UN to focus on environmental and developmental problems and solutions after an affirmation by the General Assembly resolution in the fall of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/oi.nsf/8bb15fe43a5fb81788256b58005ff079/398761d6c3c7184988256fc40078499b!OpenDocument|title=History of Sustainability&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=epa.gov|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230314/http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/oi.nsf/8bb15fe43a5fb81788256b58005ff079/398761d6c3c7184988256fc40078499b!OpenDocument|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new organization was the Brundtland Commission, or more formally, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED). The Brundtland Commission was first headed by [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] as Chairman and [[Mansour Khalid]] as Vice-Chairman.

The organization aimed to create a united international community with shared sustainability goals by identifying sustainability problems worldwide, raising awareness about them, and suggesting the implementation of solutions. In 1987, the Brundtland Commission published the first volume of “[[Our Common Future]],” the organization’s main report. “[[Our Common Future]]” strongly influenced the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992 and the third UN Conference on Environment and Development in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2002. Also, it is credited with crafting the most prevalent definition of sustainability, as seen below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_03.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623004236/http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_03.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 June 2010|title=This Norwegian's past may connect with your future|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events before Brundtland===

During the 1980s it had been revealed that the [[World Bank]] had started to experience an expanded role in intervening with the economic and social policies of the [[Third World]]. This was most notable through the events at [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] in 1945. The ideas of [[neoliberalism]] and the institutions promoting [[economic globalization]] dominated the political agenda of the world's then leading trading nations: the United States under President [[Ronald Reagan]] and the United Kingdom under Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], both classical liberals.

These events led into an era of [[free market]]s built on a distortion of the international order forged in 1945 at Bretton Woods. Bretton Woods was transformed through the 1980s and 1990s, finally ending in 1995 with the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]] ushered in by United States President [[Bill Clinton]]. Bretton Woods was formed as an arrangement among the industrialized nation states, but was transformed into a global regime of ostensibly free markets that privileged [[multinational corporations]] and actually undermined the [[sovereignty]] of the very national communities that established Bretton Woods.

The Brundtland Report was intended as a response to the conflict between the nascent order promoting globalized economic growth and the accelerating ecological degradation occurring on a global scale. The challenge posed in the 1980s was to harmonize prosperity with ecology. This postulated finding the means to continue economic growth without undue harm to the environment. To address the urgent needs of developing countries (Third World), the United Nations saw a need to strike a better balance of human and environmental well-being. This was to be achieved by redefining the concepts of "economic development" as the new idea of "sustainable development" - as it was called in the Brundtland Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldsustainability.pbworks.com/w/page/15443575/PreludeToBrundtland|title=ProfWork / PreludeToBrundtland|work=pbworks.com|accessdate=18 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118221135/http://worldsustainability.pbworks.com/w/page/15443575/PreludeToBrundtland|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand this paradigm shift, we start with the meaning of the key term: development

===Resolution establishing the Commission===

The 1983 [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] passed Resolution 38/161 "Process of preparation of the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond", establishing the Commission.&lt;ref name="estabRes"/&gt; In A/RES/38/161, the General Assembly:

:"8. Suggests that the Special Commission, when established, should focus mainly on the following terms of reference for its work:

::(a) To propose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development to the year 2000 and beyond;

::(b) To recommend ways in which concern for the environment may be translated into greater co-operation among developing countries and between countries at different stages of economic and social development and lead to the achievement of common and mutually supportive objectives which take account of the interrelationships between people, resources, environment and development;

::(c) To consider ways and means by which the international community can deal more effectively with environmental concerns, in the light of the other recommendations in its report;

::(d) To help to define shared perceptions of long-term environmental issues and of the appropriate efforts needed to deal successfully with the problems of protecting and enhancing the environment, a long-term agenda for action during the coming decades, and aspirational goals for the world community, taking into account the relevant resolutions of the session of a special character of the Governing Council in 1982;"&lt;ref name="estabRes"&gt;United Nations. 1983.

==Modern definition of sustainable development==
{{Main|Sustainable development}}
The Brundtland Commission draws upon several notions in its definition of [[sustainable development]], which is the most frequently cited definition of the concept to date.

A key element in the definition is the unity of environment and development. The Brundtland Commission argues against the assertions of the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and provides an alternative perspective on sustainable development, unique from that of the 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The Brundtland Commission pushed for the idea that while the "environment" was previously perceived as a sphere separate from human emotion or action, and while "development" was a term habitually used to describe political goals or economic progress, it is more comprehensive to understand the two terms in relation to each other (We can better understand the environment in relation to development and we can better understand development in relation to the environment, because they cannot and should not be distinguished as separate entities). Brundtland argues:

"...the "environment" is where we live; and "development" is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable."

The Brundtland Commission insists upon the environment being something beyond physicality, going beyond that traditional school of thought to include social and political atmospheres and circumstances. It also insists that development is not just about how poor countries can ameliorate their situation, but what the entire world, including developed countries, can do to ameliorate our common situation.

The term sustainable development was coined in the paper ''Our Common Future'', released by the Brundtland Commission.
Sustainable development is the kind of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The two key concepts of sustainable development are:
• the concept of "needs" in particular the essential needs of the world's poorest people, to which they should be given overriding priority; and
• the idea of limitations which is imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet both present and future needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Editorials/Kates-apr05-full.html|title=Environment Magazine - What Is Sustainable Development? Goals, Indicators, Values, and Practice|first=Environment Magazine - Taylor and|last=Francis|work=environmentmagazine.org|accessdate=18 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118214557/http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Editorials/Kates-apr05-full.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most agree that the central idea of the Brundtland Commission's definition of "sustainable development" is that of intergenerational equity. In sum, the "needs" are basic and essential, economic growth will facilitate their fulfillment, and equity is encouraged by citizen participation. Therefore, another characteristic that really sets this definition apart from others is the element of humanity that the Brundtland Commission integrates.

The particular ambiguity and openness-to-interpretation of this definition has allowed for widespread support from diverse efforts, groups and organizations. However, this has also been a criticism; perceived by some notable commentators as "self-defeating and compromised rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;Manns, .J., "Beyond Brudtland's Compromise", Town &amp; Country Planning, August 2010, pp.337-340 {{cite web |url=http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=900 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416182659/http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=900 |archivedate=2015-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It nonetheless lays out a core set of guiding principles that can be enriched by an evolving global discourse. As a result of the work of the Brundtland Commission, the issue of sustainable development is on the agenda of numerous international and national institutions, as well as corporations and city efforts. The definition gave light to new perspectives on the sustainability of an ever-changing planet with an ever-changing population.

-Brundtland commission
(Our Common Future)
The Report of the Brundtland Commission, Our Common Future, was published by Oxford University Press in 1987, and was welcomed by the General Assembly Resolution 42/187. Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, General Assembly Resolution 42/187, 11 December 1987. One version with links to cited documents Our Common Future, Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987. Published as Annex to General Assembly document A/42/427, Development and International Co-operation is available.

The document was the culmination of a “900-day” international-exercise which catalogued, analysed, and synthesised written submissions and expert testimony from “senior government representatives, scientists and experts, research institutes, industrialists, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and the general public” held at public hearings throughout the world.

The Brundtland Commission's mandate was to: “[1] re-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative, concrete, and realistic action proposals to deal with them; [2] strengthen international cooperation on environment and development and assess and propose new forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change; and [3] raise the level of understanding and commitment to action on the part of individuals, voluntary organizations, businesses, institutes, and governments” (1987: 347). “The Commission focused its attention on the areas of population, food security, the loss of species and genetic resources, energy, industry, and human settlements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another” (1987: 27).

The Brundtland Commission Report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation, and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed. As such, the Report offered “the analysis, the broad remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development” within such societies (1987:16). However, the Report was unable to identify the mode(s) of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment, and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth, the Report postulated that such growth could be reformed and expanded; this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development.

The report deals with sustainable development and the change of politics needed for achieving it. The definition of this term in the report is quite well known and often cited:

:"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". It contains two key concepts:
:*the concept of "needs", in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and
:*the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs."

==Structure==
The Brundtland Commission was chaired by former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. Politicians, civil servants, and environmental experts make up the majority of the members. Members of the commission represent 21 different nations (both developed and developing countries are included). Many of the members are important political figures in their home country. One example is [[William Ruckelshaus]], former head of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. All members of the commission were appointed by both Gro Harlem Brundtland and [[Mansour Khalid]], the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

The commission focuses on setting up networks to promote environmental stewardship. Most of these networks make connections between governments and non-government entities. One such network is Bill Clinton's Council on Sustainable Development. In this council government and business leaders come together to share ideas on how to encourage sustainable development. The Brundtland Commission has been the most successful in forming international ties between governments and multinational corporations. The 1992 and 2002 [[Earth Summit]]s were the direct result of the Brundtland Commission. The international structure and scope of the Brundtland Commission allow multiple problems (such as [[deforestation]] and [[ozone depletion]]) to be looked at from a holistic approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd15/media/backgrounder_brundtland.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=17 April 2012|website=archive.org|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417131934/http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd15/media/backgrounder_brundtland.pdf|archivedate=17 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability efforts==
The three main pillars of sustainable development include economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality. While many people agree that each of these three ideas contribute to the overall idea of sustainability, it is difficult to find evidence of equal levels of initiatives for the three pillars in countries' policies worldwide. With the overwhelming number of countries that put economic growth on the forefront of sustainable development, it is evident that the other two pillars have been suffering, especially with the overall well being of the environment in a dangerously unhealthy state. The Brundtland Commission has put forth a conceptual framework that many nations agree with and want to try to make a difference with in their countries, but it has been difficult to change these concepts about sustainability into concrete actions and programs. Implementing sustainable development globally is still a challenge, but because of the Brundtland Commission's efforts, progress has been made. After releasing their report, ''Our Common Future'', the Brundtland Commission called for an international meeting to take place where more concrete initiatives and goals could be mapped out. This meeting was held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. A comprehensive plan of action, known as [[Agenda&amp;nbsp;21]], came out of the meeting. Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 entailed actions to be taken globally, nationally, and locally in order to make life on Earth more sustainable going into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/index.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405221844/http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/index.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 April 2012|title=DSD :: Resources - Publications - Core Publications|date=5 April 2012|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic Growth===
Economic Growth is the pillar that most groups focus on when attempting to attain more sustainable efforts and development. In trying to build their economies, many countries focus their efforts on resource extraction, which leads to unsustainable efforts for environmental protection as well as economic growth sustainability. While the Commission was able to help to change the association between economic growth and resource extraction, the total worldwide consumption of resources is projected to increase in the future. So much of the natural world has already been converted into human use that the focus cannot simply remain on economic growth and omit the ever-growing problem of environmental sustainability. Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 reinforces the importance of finding ways to generate economic growth without hurting the environment. Through various trade negotiations such as improving access to markets for exports of developing countries, Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 looks to increase economic growth sustainability in countries that need it most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_02.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408182141/http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_02.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 April 2012|title=DSD :: Resources - Publications - Core Publications|date=8 April 2012|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Protection===
Environmental Protection has become more important to government and businesses over the last 20&amp;nbsp;years, leading to great improvements in the number of people willing to invest in green technologies. For the second year in a row in 2010, the United States and Europe added more power capacity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. In 2011 the efforts continue with 45 new wind energy projects beginning in 25 different states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/reports/upload/3Q-2011-AWEA-Market-Report-for-Public.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118220031/http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/reports/upload/3Q-2011-AWEA-Market-Report-for-Public.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on environmental protection has transpired globally as well, including a great deal of investment in renewable energy power capacity. Eco-city development occurring around the world helps to develop and implement water conservation, smart grids with renewable energy sources, LED street lights and energy efficient building. The consumption gap remains, consisting of the fact that "roughly 80 percent of the natural resources used each year are consumed by about 20 percent of the world's population". This level is striking and still needs to be addressed now and throughout the future.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/gsp/docs/GSP1-6_Background%20on%20Sustainable%20Devt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321094820/http://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/gsp/docs/GSP1-6_Background%20on%20Sustainable%20Devt.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Equality===
The Social Equality and Equity as pillars of sustainable development focus on the social well-being of people. The growing gap between incomes of rich and poor is evident throughout the world with the incomes of the richer households increasing relative to the incomes of middle - or lower-class households.This is attributed partly to the land distribution patterns in rural areas where majority live from land. Global inequality has been declining, but the world is still extremely unequal, with the richest 1% of the world’s population owning 40% of the world’s wealth and the poorest 50% owning around 1%. The Brundtland Commission made a significant impact trying to link environment and development and thus, go away from the idea of environmental protection whereby some scholars saw environment as something of its sake. The Commission has thus reduced the number of people living on less than a dollar a day to just half of what it used to be, as many can approach the environment and use it.These achievements can also be attributed to economic growth in [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

'''Building restoration''' describes a particular treatment approach and philosophy within the field of [[architectural conservation]].

According to the U.S. ''Secretary of Interior's standards'', "Restoration is said as the act or process of accurately depicting the form, features, and character of a property as it appeared at a particular period of time by means of the removal of features from other periods in its history and reconstruction of missing features from the restoration period. The limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems and other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate within a restoration project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intro|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/restore/restore_index.htm|work=Secretary of Interior's Standards for Restoration|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|accessdate=April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010113212/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/restore/restore_index.htm|archivedate=2011-10-10|df=}} Updated 12/113/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States restoration is different from preservation (American English, ''conservation'' in British English) by allowing the removal of historic materials to create an accurate portrayal of a particular time period, not necessarily the original or final time periods.

==Overview==
[[File:Valletta Großmeisterpalast.JPG|thumb|The [[Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta]], [[Malta]] being restored in 2011.]]
In the field of [[historic preservation]], building restoration is the action or process of accurately revealing, recovering or representing the state of a historic building, as it appeared at a particular period in its history, while protecting its heritage value. Restoration work may be performed to reverse decay, or alterations made to the building(s)

Since Historic Building Conservation is more about fostering a deep appreciation for these famous structures and learning more about why they exist, rather than just keeping historic structures standing tall and looking as beautiful as ever, true historic building preservation aims for a high level of authenticity, accurately replicating historic materials and techniques as much as possible, ideally using modern techniques only in a concealed manner where they will not compromise the historic character of the structure's appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pearlbaycorp.com/historicrestorations.html | title=Historic Building Restoration, Preservation, and Renovation | publisher=Pearl Bay Corporation | accessdate=28 May 2015 | author=Van Sanford, Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance a restoration might involve the replacement of outdated heating and cooling systems with newer ones, or the installation of climate controls that never existed at the time of building after careful study. [[Tsarskoye Selo]], the complex of former royal palaces outside [[St Petersburg]] in [[Russia]] is an example of this sort of work.

Exterior and interior paint colors present similar problems over time. Air pollution, acid rain, and sun take a toll, and often many layers of different paint exist. [[Historic paint analysis]] of old paint layers now allow a corresponding chemical recipe and color to be re-produced. But this is often only a beginning as many of the original materials are either unstable or in many cases environmentally unsound. Many eighteenth century greens were made with arsenic and lead, materials no longer allowed in paints. Another problem occurs when the original pigment came from a material no longer available. For example, in the early to mid-19th century, some browns were produced from bits of ground [[mummy|mummies]]. In cases like this the standards allow other materials with similar appearance to be used and organizations like Britain's [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]] will work with a historic paint color re-creator s to replicate the antique paints in durable, stable, and environmentally safe materials. In the United States the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] is a helpful resource. The [[polychrome]] painted interiors of the [[Vermont State House]] and [[Boston Public Library]] are examples of this type of heritage restoration.

==Secretary of Interiors standards for restoration==

In the United States, the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of Interior]] is the head of the [[National Park Service]] which owns and maintains thousands of historic buildings and has been a leader in historic preservation for over 100 years. The standards were developed in 1975 and updated in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, David E.. ''Guidelines for the evaluation and control of lead-based paint hazards in housing''. Washington D.C.: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 1995. 18-5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The standards deal with the "...materials, features, finishes, spaces, and spatial relationships..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/overview/choose_treat.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122165718/http://www.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/overview/choose_treat.htm |archivedate=2013-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of historic buildings and are divided into preservation, rehabilitating, restoration and reconstruction. It helps to understand what building restoration is in context with the other standards:
* '''Preservation''' "places a high premium on the retention of all historic fabric through conservation, maintenance and repair." All materials added to a building over its life are retained and only work which is necessary to protect it from deterioration is carried out.
* '''Rehabilitation''' is a standard for preservation but is more lenient because it presumes the building is so deteriorated that it needs some repairs to prevent further deterioration.
* '''Restoration''' includes preservation, leaving as much material untouched as possible, reconstruction to replace missing elements, and repair work to bring the building to a historically accurate condition in one particular time period. This may include removing some historic building elements (after documenting them) to make the building historically accurate for a specific date in history.
* '''Reconstruction''' allows the re-creation of a missing building or element in all new, appropriate materials.

The first steps in a restoration to the Secretary's standards are to study the building and choose a time period for the restoration. The new use of the building should be consistent with the original use or at least with the time period of the restoration. Materials which were added after the chosen time period must be documented and then may be removed while preserving and repairing the appropriate materials. Materials missing may be reconstructed to "...match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials." which are evidence based. Modern chemical and physical treatments may be gently used if they do not damage the historic materials, and archaeological resources will be preserved or mitigated. The standards recognize that there are inherent conflicts with modern codes and regulations for energy efficiency, health, safety, and accessibility. The standards allow sensitive alterations of historic buildings to meet the spirit of the codes and regulations, if necessary.

==Storm Restoration==

Storm restoration is the restoring of a building due to damage from a severe storm. Most damage is caused by strong wind gusts or hail, but may also include large amounts of rainfall, lightning strikes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Restored chapel|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150426/social/Restored-chapel.565567|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=26 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824110733/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150426/social/Restored-chapel.565567|archivedate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as extreme storms such as tornadoes and hurricanes. The majority of storm damage occurs on roofs, sides of structures, and in basements, but over time causes damage to the interior. Unlike heritage restoration, storm restoration takes place on buildings with no historic significance as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uasrc.org/|title=United Association of Storm Restoration Contractors|first=Jacob|last=Sachs|website=uasrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cable lacing''' is a method for tying [[Cable harness|wiring harness]]es and [[cable loom]]s, traditionally used in [[telecommunication]], naval, and aerospace applications.  This old [[cable management]] technique, taught to generations of [[Lineman (technician)|linemen]],&lt;ref name="popmech1905"&gt;{{Citation|title=Cable Sewing Knots|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=May 1905|volume=7|number=5|issn=0032-4558|page=550|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oN8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA550|quote=Every lineman should know how to sew these knots.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is still used in some modern applications since it does not create obstructions along the length of the cable, avoiding the handling problems of cables groomed by plastic or [[Hook-and-loop fastener|hook-and-loop]] [[cable tie]]s.

Cable lacing uses a thin cord, traditionally made of waxed [[linen]], to bind together a group of cables using a series of running [[lockstitch]]es.  Flat lacing tapes made of modern materials such as [[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[Teflon]], [[fiberglass]], and [[Nomex]] are also available with a variety of coatings to improve knot holding.&lt;ref name="gudebrod"&gt;{{cite web|title=Braid Lacing Tape |url=http://www.gudebrod.com/electronic/Braid_Lacing_Tape.htm |author=Gudebrod, Inc. |accessdate=2008-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201164010/http://www.gudebrod.com/electronic/Braid_Lacing_Tape.htm |archivedate=December 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nebenstellenanlage-Kabelbaum.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[PABX]] with extensive cable lacing]]

==Styles==
The lacing begins and ends with a [[whipping knot|whipping]] or other [[knot]] to secure the free ends.  Wraps are spaced relative to the overall harness diameter to maintain the wiring in a tight, neat bundle, and the ends are then neatly trimmed.  In addition to continuous or running lacing, there are a variety of lacing patterns used in different circumstances.  In some cases stand-alone knots called '''spot ties''' are also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wiring and Cable Designer's Handbook |last=Matisoff |first=Bernard S. |year=1987 |publisher= TAB Books|location=Summit, PA |isbn=0-8306-2720-0 |pages= 93–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[Lashing (ropework)|lashing]] large cables and cable bundles to support structures in telecommunications applications, there are two named cable lacing styles: the "[[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] stitch" and "[[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] stitch".&lt;ref name="qwest"&gt;{{cite web

Some organizations have in-house standards to which cable lacing must conform, for example [[NASA]] specifies its cable lacing techniques in chapter 9 of NASA-STD-8739.4.&lt;ref name="nasanote"&gt;See "External Links" section for these documents.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9177">'''[[Cannibalism]] in [[poultry]]''' is the act of one individual of a poultry species consuming all or part of another individual of the same species as food.  It commonly occurs in flocks of [[Chicken|domestic hens]] reared for egg production, although it can also occur in [[domestic turkey]]s, [[pheasants]] and other [[poultry]] species. Cannibalism can occur as a consequence of [[feather pecking]] which has caused denuded areas and bleeding on a bird's skin.&lt;ref name="Savory, (2010)"&gt;Savory, J., (2010).  Nutrition, feeding and drinking behaviour, and welfare.  In ''The Welfare of Domestic Fowl and Other Captive Birds'', I.J.H. Duncan and P. Hawkins (Eds). Springer.  pp. 165-188&lt;/ref&gt;  Cannibalism can cause large mortality rates within the flock and large decreases in production due to the stress it causes.  [[Vent pecking]], sometimes called 'cloacal cannibalism', is considered to be a separate form of cannibalistic pecking as this occurs in well-feathered birds and only the [[cloaca]] is targeted.&lt;ref name="Savory et al., (1995)"&gt;Savory, C.J., (1995).  Feather pecking and cannibalism. World's Poultry Science Journal, 51: 215–219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodenburg et al., (2008)"&gt;Rodenburg, T.B., Komen, H., Ellen, E.D., Uitdehaag, K.A., and van Arendonk, J.A.M., (2008).  Selection method and early-life history affect behavioural development, feather pecking and cannibalism in laying hens: A review.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 110: 217-228&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivational basis==
Poultry species which exhibit cannibalism are [[omnivore]]s. For example, hens in the wild often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, [[insects]] and even larger animals such as [[lizard]]s or young [[mice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gworrell.freeyellow.com/chickenfaq.html|title=Frequently asked questions about chickens &amp; eggs |accessdate=14 November 2011|publisher=Ferry Landing Farm &amp; Apiary|author=Gerard P.Worrell AKA "Farmer Jerry"}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they are mainly herbivorous in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Savory, (2010)" /&gt;  Feather pecking is often the initial cause of an injury which then attracts the cannibalistic pecking of other birds – perhaps as re-directed foraging or feeding behaviour.  In the close confines of modern farming systems, the increased pecking attention is easily observed by multiple birds which join in the attack, and often the escape attempts of the cannibalised bird attract more pecking attention.

==Development==
Chicks [[avian incubation|brooded]] with a hen had lower mortality levels due to feather pecking and cannibalism compared to non-brooded chicks. This may indicate the hen guides the chicks to peck at more rewarding substrates, such as food or litter.&lt;ref name="Riber et al., (2007)"&gt;Riber, A.B., Nielsen, B.L., Ritz, C. and Forkman, B., (2007).  Diurnal activity and synchrony in layer hen chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus). Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 108: 276–287&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
Cannibalism among layer hen flocks is highly variable; when it is not problematic, mortalities among production systems are generally similar.&lt;ref name="Appleby and Hughes, (1991)" /&gt;  Published data on the prevalence of cannibalism could be misleading due to the inclusion of vent-pecking by some researchers but not others. Mortalities, due mainly to cannibalism, can be up to 15% in egg-laying flocks housed in aviaries,&lt;ref name = "Hill, (1986)"&gt;Hill, J.A. (1986). Egg production in alternative systems - a review of recent research in the UK.  Research and Development in Agriculture, 3: 13-18&lt;/ref&gt; straw yards,&lt;ref name="Gibson et al., (1988)"&gt;Gibson, S.W., Dun, P. and Hughes, B.O., (1988).  The performance and behaviour of laying fowls in a covered strawyard system.   Research and Development in Agriculture, 5: 153-163&lt;/ref&gt; and free-range systems.&lt;ref name="Keeling et al., (1988)"&gt;Keeling, L.J., Hughes, B.O. and Dun, P., (1988).  Performance of free range laying hens in a polythene house and their behaviour on range.  Farm Building Progress, 94: 21-28&lt;/ref&gt;  Because egg-laying strains of chickens can be kept in smaller group sizes in cage systems, cannibalism is reduced,&lt;ref name="Appleby and Hughes, (1991)"&gt;Appleby, M.C. and Hughes, B.O., (1991).  Welfare of laying hens in cages and alternative systems: Environmental, physical and behavioural aspects.  World's Poultry Science Journal, 47:109-128&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a lowered trend in mortality as compared to non-cage systems. In a study which examined 'skin damage' (most of which would have been cause by pecking) on hens at the end of their productive lives, damage was lowest in hens from [[free range]] systems, followed by barns, then [[furnished cages]], and highest in conventional or [[battery cages]].&lt;ref name="Sherwin et al., (2010)"&gt;Sherwin, C.M., Richards, G.J. and Nicol, C.J., (2010).  Comparison of the welfare of layer hens in 4 housing systems in the UK.  British Poultry Science, 51: 488-499&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of control==
===Beak-trimming===
[[Debeaking|Beak-trimming]] is the most common method of preventing or reducing injuries by cannibalism. In a three-year study of floor-housed laying hens, death by cannibalism was reported as 7% in beak-trimmed birds but was increased to 18% in non-trimmed birds.&lt;ref name="Flock et al., (2005)"&gt;Flock, D.K., Laughlin K.F. and Bentley, J., (2005).  Minimizing losses in poultry breeding and production: how breeding companies contribute to poultry welfare. World's Poultry Science Journal, 61: 227–237&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group size===
Increased group sizes in larger cages or floor systems can elevate the risk of cannibalism and feather pecking, probably due to the spread of the behaviour through social learning.&lt;ref name ="Lay et al., (2011)"&gt;Lay Jr., D.C., Fulton, R.M., Hester, P.Y., Karcher, D.M., Kjaer, J.B., Mench, J.A., Mullens, B.A., Newberry, R.C., C.J., O’Sullivan, N.P. and Porter, R.E., (2011).  Hen welfare in different housing systems.  Poultry Science, 90: 278-294 {{doi|10.3382/ps.2010-00962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light manipulations===
Lights are sometimes provided in nest-boxes to attract hens to use the nests, but this practice has been correlated with an increased risk of cannibalism.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman et al., (2006)"&gt;Zimmerman, P.H., Lindberg, A.C., Pope, S.J., Glen, E., Bolhuis, J.E. and Nicol, C.J., (2006). The effect of stocking density, flock size and modified management on laying hen behaviour and welfare in a non-cage system.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 101: 111–124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perches===
Rearing chicks with access to perches by four weeks of age has been associated with increased use of perches, and reduced cannibalism, in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Gunnarsson et al., (1999)"&gt;Gunnarsson, S., Keeling, L.J. and Svedberg, J., (1999).  Effects of rearing factors on the prevalence of floor eggs, cloacal cannibalism and feather pecking in commercial flocks of loose housed laying hens. British Poultry Science, 40: 12–18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selective breeding and genetics===
A sibling-selection programme has genetically selected a low mortality line which shows decreased mortality from cannibalism compared to a control line.&lt;ref name="Nordquist et al., (2011)"&gt;Nordquist, R.E.,  Heerkens, J.L.T., Rodenburg, T.B., Boks, S., Ellen, E.D. and van der Staay, F.J., (2011).  Laying hens selected for low mortality: Behaviour in tests of fearfulness, anxiety and cognition.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 131: 110-122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eyewear===
{{Main|Chicken eyeglasses}}
Cannibalism may be reduced by fitting hens with a range of eyewear. Rose-tinted [[chicken eyeglasses|spectacles]] or contact lenses have been used. Opaque spectacles, or [[Blinders (poultry)|blinders]], have also been used. For both spectacles and blinders, there are versions that are held in place by [[circlip]]s into the [[nares]] of the bird, or others in which a pin pierces through the [[nasal septum]]: this latter method is illegal in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/pb7274-laying-hens-020717.pdf|journal=Codes of Recommendations for the Welfare of Livestock: Laying Hens|author=Department of Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs|date=July 2002|page=21|title=Mutilations}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is theorized that — as with placing red filters over windows, or keeping the birds in red light — the coloured lenses prevent the birds from recognising the blood or raw flesh of other hens, thereby diminishing cannibalistic behaviour.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune1986"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-07-18/entertainment/8602220060_1_loyl-stromberg-barnyard-chicken-chicken-related|title=Blinders Make A Spectacle For Chicken-hearted Collectors|date=July 18, 1986|last=Gold|first=Anita}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{canon law}}
In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]], a '''canon''' is a certain rule or norm of conduct or belief prescribed by the [[Catholic Church]]. The word "canon" comes from the Greek ''kanon'', which in its original usage denoted a straight rod that was later the instrument used by architects and artificers as a measuring stick for making straight lines.&lt;ref name=Berman199&gt;Berman, ''Law and Revolution'', pg. 199&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kanon'' eventually came to mean a rule or norm, so that when the first ecumenical council—[[Nicaea I]]—was held in 325, ''kanon'' started to obtain the restricted juridical denotation of a law [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgated]] by a [[synod]] or [[ecumenical council]], as well as that of an individual bishop.&lt;ref name=Berman199/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Wiktionary|canon law}}
[[Greek language|Greek]] ''kanon'' / {{lang-grc|κανών}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] Qanun / قانون, [[Hebrew]] kaneh / קנה, "straight"; a rule, code, standard, or measure; the root meaning in all these languages is "reed" (''cf.'' the Romance-language ancestors of the English word "cane"). A ''kanon'' was the instrument used by architects and artificers for making straight lines.

==Pre-Nicene usage==
{{main article|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
Some writers think that the Church preferred the word ''canon'' to ''[[law]]'', as the latter had a harsh meaning for the faithful in the times of persecution.

The early Fathers use canon as equivalent to the rule of faith, or for some formula expressing a binding obligation on Christians.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Irenæus, Adv. Hær., I, ix; Tertullian, De Præscr., 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bickell declares that for the first three hundred years, canon is scarcely ever found for a separate and special decree of the Church; rather does it designate the rule of faith in general. He appeals to the fact that the plural form of the word is seldom used in the earliest Christian writers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Bickell, Geschichte des Kirchenrechts, I, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicene and Medieval usage==
With the fourth century began the use of canon for a disciplinary decree, owing to its employment in this sense by the [[First Council of Nicea]] (325 A.D.).

The Cassinese editors of Ferraris (s. v. Canones) say that in the first ages of the Church many disciplinary regulations were not required, and hence it was scarcely necessary to discriminate decrees into dogmatic and disciplinary, as the faithful classed both under the obligation to observe the general rule of faith.

===''Canon'' vs. ''decretum''===
{{see also|Decree (canon law)|Decretal|Decretum Gratiani}}
From the fourth century onward, ''canon'' signified almost universally a disciplinary decree of a council or of the [[Roman Pontiff]]s.

The word ''decretum'' during the same period, though signifying in general an authoritative statute or decision, began to be limited more and more to dogmatic matters, while canon when used in opposition to it was restricted to laws of discipline. That this usage, however, was not invariable is evident from [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s use of "[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]" to signify his collection of canons and decrees.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] himself entitled his work ''Concordantia discordantium canonum'' or "Concordance of Discordant Canons". Early [[Decretists]] gave to Gratian's [[codification (law)|codification]] the title of ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tridentine usage==
From the [[First Council of Nicea]] up to the beginning of the [[Council of Trent]], the regulations concerning discipline issued by assemblies of bishops received the name of canons.

With the [[Council of Trent]] in the sixteenth century began the departure from this ancient usage. This council used the word ''canon'' for short, dogmatic definitions with an anathema attached to them. On the other hand, it gave the name of ''decrees'' to its disciplinary regulations. The example set by Trent was followed by the [[First Council of the Vatican]].

The usage of Trent seems to bring ''canon'' nearer to the signification it bore before the [[First Council of Nicea]], when it referred rather to faith than to discipline. The general idea of a decision by Church authority seems to be also the root-meaning of the expressions "[[Canon of Scripture]]", "[[Canon of the Mass]]", "[[Canonization#Catholic Church|Canon of Saints]]", although for the last term Ducange (s. v. Canonizare) suggests a somewhat different origin.

==Codifications==
As ecclesiastical regulations began to multiply, it became necessary to gather them into codices, which generally received the title of "[[Collections of ancient canons|Collection of Canons]]". In these, civil laws are often added to the Church regulations. For such collections the Greeks used the term ''[[Nomocanon]]es''. The Latins have no special name for them, though Capitularies (q. v.), e. g. of Charlemagne, is sometimes referred to as a somewhat parallel usage in the West.

==Authority==
As to the authority of ecclesiastical canons, it is evident a distinction must be made when speaking of canons of faith and canons of discipline, for the former are irreversible, the latter are not. Similarly, it is plain that canons containing a precept already binding by reason of [[Divine law|Divine]] or [[natural law]], cannot be on the same footing as those that are of mere ecclesiastical origin.

In general, the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'' declares&lt;ref group=note&gt;Cf. cap. 1. de Const.&lt;/ref&gt; that canonical statutes are binding on all; likewise&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Corpus Juris Canonici'', cap. Quum scimus&lt;/ref&gt; that bishops are the guardians of the canons and must see to their observance. When there is question of canons in the ordinary ecclesiastical sense (namely, that which obtained before the [[Council of Trent]]), as they refer principally to matters of discipline, it must be borne in mind that they are neither immutable nor irreformable.

The subject-matter of such canons depends not only on circumstances of persons, places, and times, but also on considerations of expediency or temporary necessity. A change in any of the causes which brought about the framing of the canons, will make a change in their binding-force, for disciplinary regulations are almost necessarily mutable.

In like manner when there is question of the binding force of a canon, it is important to determine whether it was issued by a [[ecumenical council|general council]] or by the decree of a [[pope]], as imposing an obligation on all the faithful, or whether it was framed solely for restricted regions or persons. In the latter case its binding-force is as restricted as its scope.

==Abrogation, Obrogation, and Custom==
{{main article|Obrogation|Custom (canon law)}}
It must be borne in mind that the object which the Church has always had in view in [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgating]] her canons has been the guidance and preservation of the clergy and laity in the duties of a Christian life and in the best methods of ecclesiastical administration.

Although, therefore, such canons contain elements of positive human law, yet ultimately they are founded on the [[divine law|Divine]] or [[natural law]]. As such, they cannot be entirely abrogated by contrary custom (Ferraris, loc. cit.), though their rigour may be mitigated by certain circumstances, on the ceasing of which, the pristine rigour of the canon would be again binding.

When they are entirely of human law, they may, of course, be completely abrogated, not only by legislation on the part of the proper authorities, but also by legitimate custom.

William H. W. Fanning, in his 1913 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article on ''Ecclesiastical canons'', suggests that
{{quote|The neglect of the prescriptions of the sacred canons has always been the source of corruption in morals, and perhaps the chief reason for the loss of faith by nations as well as by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;WikiSource, "Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)", [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Ecclesiastical_Canons ''Ecclesiastical Canons''], accessed 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
According to Fanning, the study of the sacred canons is especially enjoined on the clergy. Fanning speculates that perhaps most of the regulations refer directly to ecclesiastics, and suggests that clergy will find in them the surest guidance for their own conduct and for the fruitful exercise of their ministry in directing the faithful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6558">'''Careers advisory services''' in the UK are typically organisations that offer advice, guidance and counselling on careers. People may use these services for a number of purposes, such as jobhunting, changing careers, getting a promotion, building career skills, returning to work after a career break and professional development. [[Career]] challenges such as these occur for many reasons, including redundancy, motherhood, leaving full-time education, relocation, or simply coming to the end of a work contract.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Houghton Finding Square Holes: Discover Who You Really Are and Find the Perfect Career&lt;/ref&gt; 

These services usually employ professional career counsellors, coaches and guides to mentor their clients. In the UK, such professionals might have qualifications from institutes such as the [[Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development]] (CIPD), International Coach Federation (ICF) and the [[British Psychology Society]] (BPS). The [[Global Career Development Facilitator]] is an international certificate held by about 17.500 people (2010) in the United States, Canada, Japan, China, Taiwan, Germany, Romania, Turkey, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cce-global.org/GCDF&lt;/ref&gt;

The Educational and Vocational Guidance Practitioner (EVGP) is a credential of the International Association for Educational and Vocational Guidance (IAEVG) based on competency inventory. The EVGP is administered and awarded on behalf of the IAEVG by the Center of Credentialing and Education in Greensboro, North Carolina, in the United States, which is an affiliate subsidiary of the American National Board of Certified Counselors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cce-global.org/EVGP |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502190405/http://www.cce-global.org/EVGP |archivedate=2015-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of the earliest examples of a governmental careers advisory service in the UK came as a result of The Education (Choice of Employment) Act (1910). This gave local education authorities the opportunity to advise juveniles on getting work. Each education authority had an officer who was assigned the specific role of advising juveniles in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. David Peck Careers Services: History, Policy and Practice in the United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of careers advisory services==
The UK government’s careers advisory service is called [https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/Pages/Home.aspx The National Careers Service]. Most UK universities also have their own in-house careers advisory services for students and alumni. A number of corporate entities also have in-house careers advisory services for their employees. There are privately owned, independent careers advisory services throughout the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Watts et al: Rethinking Careers Education and Guidance: Theory Policy and Practice&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accessing careers advisory services==
Traditionally, clients of careers advisory services have met up with their [[career guide]]/counsellor/coach face-to-face to work through their career challenges. Nowadays, however, careers advisory services may offer remote channels of communication such as careers telephone lines and online tools.&lt;ref&gt;AG Watts &amp; Gareth Dent "Let your Fingers do the Walking": the Use of Telephone Helplines in Career Information and Guidance, {{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/wg/LetYourFingersDoTheWalking.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040710120052/http://www.gla.ac.uk/wg/LetYourFingersDoTheWalking.pdf |archivedate=2004-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now private companies that are offering subscription-based online careers information, advice and guidance to schools across the UK. Some careers advisory services also go out into the community by running seminars and workshops.

==Methods and tools==
Careers advisory services adopt many different techniques and tools to assist their clients. They include such things as: diagnostic tests and questionnaires; personality assessments; CV writing workshops; [[mock interview]]s;'career drivers' questionnaires and visionboards. An established career coaching technique used by many careers advisers is a combination of the [[GROW_model|GROW]] model and the 'solution-focused' methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Erik de Haan &amp; Yvonne Burger: Coaching with colleagues: an action guide to one-to-one learning&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell, B; Palmer, S. (2003), Introduction to the Solution-Focused Approach, Sage. London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards and guidelines==
In the UK, careers advisory services must adhere to British Guidance Council Quality Standards by meeting criteria consisting of several detailed competencies. The performance of staff within these services is also keenly observed by these standards. Further standards and guidelines concentrate on quality of informational material, such as books, manuals and commercial PDFs, as well as learning and delivery outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Plant: Quality in Careers Guidance, http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/35/47/2698228.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
People in the Republic of Ireland can find careers advisory services through organisations such as the FAS-Irish National Training and Employment Authority. In Northern Ireland, careers guidance services are delivered by the Northern Ireland Careers Service and Educational Guidance Service for Adults.

'''Carl Prinzler''' was the Manager of the Builders Hardware Department at the '''[[Vonnegut Hardware Company]]''' in 1903.  Prinzler, along with his architect and engineer neighbor [[Henry H. DuPont]], developed the first "[[panic bar]]" device for doors which can be opened from the inside despite being locked on the outside.  This idea and subsequently an invention came about as a result of the [[Iroquois Theater Fire]].  Prinzler devoted himself to the invention to ensure another tragedy such as this never happened again.

The panic bar was marketed under the [[Von Duprin]] name.  Von Duprin is a company which makes security related products and nowadays belongs to '''[[Allegion]]'''.

Creating a '''cellular model''' has been a particularly challenging task of [[systems biology]] and [[mathematical biology]].
It involves developing efficient [[algorithms]], [[data structures]], [[Biological data visualization|visualization]] and communication tools to orchestrate the integration of large quantities of biological data with the goal of [[computer modeling]].

It is also directly associated with [[bioinformatics]], [[computational biology]] and [[Artificial life]].

It involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of the many [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s which comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes.

The complex network of biochemical reaction/transport processes and their spatial organization make the development of a predictive model of a living cell a grand challenge for the 21st century.

==Overview==
The eukaryotic [[cell cycle]] is very complex and is one of the most studied topics, since its misregulation leads to [[cancer]]s.
It is possibly a good example of a mathematical model as it deals with simple calculus but gives valid results. Two research groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpf.biol.vt.edu/lab_website/ |title=The JJ Tyson Lab|publisher=[[Virginia Tech]]|date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cellcycle.bme.hu/ |title=The Molecular Network Dynamics Research Group|publisher=[[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; have produced several models of the cell cycle simulating several organisms. They have recently produced a generic eukaryotic cell cycle model which can represent a particular eukaryote depending on the values of the parameters, demonstrating that the idiosyncrasies of the individual cell cycles are due to different protein concentrations and affinities, while the underlying mechanisms are conserved (Csikasz-Nagy et al., 2006).&lt;br /&gt;
By means of a system of [[ordinary differential equation]]s these models show the change in time ([[dynamical system]]) of the protein inside a single typical cell; this type of model is called a [[deterministic system|deterministic process]] (whereas a model describing a statistical distribution of protein concentrations in a population of cells is called a [[stochastic process]]).&lt;br /&gt;
To obtain these equations an iterative series of steps must be done: first the several models and observations are combined to form a consensus diagram and the appropriate kinetic laws are chosen to write the differential equations, such as [[Reaction rate|rate kinetics]] for stoichiometric reactions, [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics]] for enzyme substrate reactions and [[Goldbeter–Koshland kinetics]] for ultrasensitive transcription factors, afterwards the parameters of the equations (rate constants, enzyme efficiency coefficients and Michaelis constants) must be fitted to match observations; when they cannot be fitted the kinetic equation is revised and when that is not possible the wiring diagram is modified. The parameters are fitted and validated using observations of both wild type and mutants, such as protein half-life and cell size.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to fit the parameters the differential equations need to be studied. This can be done either by simulation or by analysis. &lt;br /&gt;
In a simulation, given a starting [[Array data structure|vector]] (list of the values of the variables), the progression of the system is calculated by solving the equations at each time-frame in small increments.&lt;br /&gt;
In analysis, the properties of the equations are used to investigate the behavior of the system depending of the values of the parameters and variables. A system of differential equations can be represented as a [[vector field]], where each vector described the change (in concentration of two or more protein) determining where and how fast the trajectory (simulation) is heading. Vector fields can have several special points: a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|stable point]], called a sink, that attracts in all directions (forcing the concentrations to be at a certain value), an [[unstable point]], either a source or a [[saddle point]] which repels (forcing the concentrations to change away from a certain value), and a limit cycle, a closed trajectory towards which several trajectories spiral towards (making the concentrations oscillate).&lt;br /&gt; A better representation which can handle the large number of variables and parameters is called a [[bifurcation diagram]] ([[bifurcation theory]]): the presence of these special steady-state points at certain values of a parameter (e.g. mass) is represented by a point and once the parameter passes a certain value, a qualitative change occurs, called a bifurcation, in which the nature of the space changes, with profound consequences for the protein concentrations: the cell cycle has phases (partially corresponding to G1 and G2) in which mass, via a stable point, controls cyclin levels, and phases (S and M phases) in which the concentrations change independently, but once the phase has changed at a bifurcation event ([[cell cycle checkpoint]]), the system cannot go back to the previous levels since at the current mass the vector field is profoundly different and the mass cannot be reversed back through the bifurcation event, making a checkpoint irreversible. In particular the S and M checkpoints are regulated by means of special bifurcations called a [[Hopf bifurcation]] and an [[infinite period bifurcation]].

==Molecular level simulations==
Cell Collective&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cellcollective.org/ | title=Interactive Modeling of Biological Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a modeling software that enables one to house dynamical biological data, build computational models, stimulate, break and recreate models. The development is led by Tomas Helikar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://helikarlab.org/members.html | title=Helikar Lab - Members}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a researcher within the field of computational biology. It is designed for biologists, students learning about computational biology, teachers focused on teaching life sciences, and researchers within the field of life science. The complexities of math and computer science are built into the backend and one can learn about the methods used for modeling biological species, but complex math equations, algorithms, programming are not required and hence won't impede model building.

The mathematical framework behind Cell Collective is based on a common qualitative (discrete) modeling technique where the regulatory mechanism of each node is described with a logical function [for more comprehensive information on logical modeling, see &lt;ref&gt;Morris MK, Saez-Rodriguez J, Sorger PK, Lauffenburger DA.. Logic-based models for the analysis of cell signaling networks. Biochemistry (2010) 49(15):3216–24.10.1021/bi902202q
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helikar T, Kowal B, Madrahimov A, Shrestha M, Pedersen J, Limbu K, et al. Bio-Logic Builder: a nontechnical tool for building dynamical, qualitative models. PLoS One (2012) 7(10):e46417.10.1371/journal.pone.0046417&lt;/ref&gt;].

Model validation
The model was constructed using local (e.g., protein–protein interaction) information from the primary literature. In other words, during the construction phase of the model, there was no attempt to determine the local interactions based on any other larger phenotypes or phenomena. However, after the model was completed, verification of the accuracy of the model involved testing it for the ability to reproduce complex input–output phenomena that have been observed in the laboratory. To do this, the T-cell model was simulated under a multitude of cellular conditions and analyzed in terms of input–output dose–response curves to determine whether the model behaves as expected, including various downstream effects as a result of activation of the TCR, G-protein-coupled receptor, cytokine, and integrin pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Conroy BD, Herek TA, Shew TD, Latner M, Larson JJ, Allen L, et al.

The E-Cell Project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.e-cell.org/ | title=E-Cell project}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims "to make precise whole cell simulation at the molecular level possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.e-cell.org/ecell/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029020449/http://www.e-cell.org/ecell |archive-date=2010-10-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CytoSolve]] - developed by [[Shiva Ayyadurai|V. A. Shiva Ayyadurai]] and C. Forbes Dewey Jr. of Department of Biological Engineering at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] - provided a method to model the whole cell by dynamically integrating multiple molecular pathway models. ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Al-Lazikani |first1=Bissan|last2=Banerji |first2=Udai | last3=Workman |first3=Paul |year=2012 |title= Combinatorial drug therapy for cancer in the post-genomic era|journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=30 |issue= 7|pages=679–692 |doi= 10.1038/nbt.2284|url= |pmid=22781697}}&lt;!--|accessdate=14 February 2013 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Ayyadurai| first1=VA Shiva|first2=C.

In the July 2012 issue of [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']], a team led by [[Markus W. Covert|Markus Covert]] at Stanford published the most complete computational model of a cell to date. The model of the roughly 500-gene ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' contains 28 algorithmically-independent components incorporating work from over 900 sources. It accounts for interactions of the complete [[genome]], [[transcriptome]], [[proteome]], and [[metabolome]] of the organism, marking a significant advancement for the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://covertlab.stanford.edu/publicationpdfs/mgenitalium_whole_cell_2012_07_20.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/july/computer-model-organism-071812.html | title=Stanford researchers produce first complete computer model of an organism| date=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most attempts at modeling cell cycle processes have focused on the broad, complicated molecular interactions of many different chemicals, including several [[cyclin]] and [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] molecules as they correspond to the [[S phase|S]], [[M phase|M]], [[G1 phase|G1]] and [[G2 phase|G2]] phases of the [[cell cycle]]. In a 2014 published article in PLOS computational biology, collaborators at [[University of Oxford]], [[Virginia Tech]] and Institut de Génétique et Développement de Rennes produced a simplified model of the cell cycle using only one cyclin/CDK interaction. This model showed the ability to control totally functional [[cell division]] through regulation and manipulation only the one interaction, and even allowed researchers to skip phases through varying the concentration of CDK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cell Cycle Control by a Minimal Cdk Network|journal = PLoS Comput Biol|date = 2015-02-06|pmc = 4319789|pmid = 25658582|pages = e1004056|volume = 11|issue = 2|doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004056|first = Claude|last = Gérard|first2 = John J.|last2 = Tyson|first3 = Damien|last3 = Coudreuse|first4 = Béla|last4 = Novák}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model could help understand how the relatively simple interactions of one chemical translate to a cellular level model of cell division.

The '''Centre for Medieval Studies (CMS)''' is a [[research centre]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Canada]] dedicated to the history, thought, and artistic expression of the cultures that flourished during the [[Middle Ages]].

The centre was founded in 1964, with [[Bertie Wilkinson]] as its first director. Its foundation was announced in [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Graduate Center for Mediaeval Studies: University of Toronto |journal=Speculum |date=October 1963 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=678–681 |doi=10.1017/S0038713400061698 |jstor=2851698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The intention of the Center is to make available to students various approaches to the Middle Ages in programs of studies not available in existing departments. The purpose of the Center is the training of scholars who know the Middle Ages in depth as well as in breadth. The courses of study will freely cross limits of traditional disciplines and departments, but they will be limited to the Middle Ages. By concentrating on a single period, the student will be able to acquire in some depth the basic linguistic and technical skills necessary for teaching and research in mediaeval studies; these include palaeography, diplomatics, and vernacular languages, in which the Center is strong. He will also be able to read widely in the period. His research will follow the material of his subject in order to gain a better understanding of the cross currents and variations in the cultures, interests, and beliefs of the Middle Ages.}}

The centre had originated in a Medieval Club that met at [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://medieval.utoronto.ca/about/history/ |website=Centre for Medieval Studies |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by the [[Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies]] (PIMS), which had been founded in 1929 by [[Étienne Gilson]].

The Centre's logo was designed by [[Allan Fleming]], while he was head of graphic design at [[University of Toronto Press]], from 1968–76.&lt;ref name="device"&gt;{{cite web |title=Centre Device |url=http://medieval.utoronto.ca/about/device/ |website=Centre for Medieval Studies |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre is now located in the [[Lillian Massey Building]], part of [[Victoria University, Toronto]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4237">[[File:Chronospecies.svg|thumb|In [[palaeontology]], the evidence for [[species]] and [[evolution]] comes mainly from the [[comparative anatomy]] of [[fossil]]s. A chronospecies is defined in a single lineage (solid line) whose morphology changes with time. At some point, palaeontologists judge that enough change has occurred that two forms (A and B), separated in time and anatomy, once existed. If only sporadic examples of each survive in the fossil record, then the forms will appear sharply distinct.]]
A '''chronospecies''' is a [[species]] derived from a [[anagenesis|sequential development pattern]] which involves continual and uniform changes from an extinct ancestral form on an evolutionary scale. This sequence of alterations eventually produces a population which is physically, [[Comparative anatomy|morphologically]], and/or [[Genetics|genetically]] distinct from the original ancestors. Throughout this change, there is only one species in the lineage at any point in time, as opposed to cases where [[divergent evolution]] produces contemporary species with a common ancestor. The related term '''paleospecies''' (or '''palaeospecies''') indicates an extinct species only identified with [[fossil]] material. This identification relies on distinct similarities between the earlier fossil specimens and some proposed descendant, although the exact relationship to the later species is not always defined. In particular, the range of variation within all the early fossil specimens does not exceed the observed range which exists in the later species.

A '''paleosubspecies''' (or '''palaeosubspecies''') identifies an extinct [[subspecies]] which evolved into the currently existing form. This connection with relatively recent variations, usually from the [[Late Pleistocene]], often relies on the additional information available in [[subfossil]] material. Most of the current species have changed in size [[adaptation (biology)|adapting]] to the climatic changes during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] (''see'' [[Bergmann's Rule]]).

The further identification of fossil specimens as part of a "chronospecies" relies on additional similarities which more strongly indicate a specific relationship with a known species. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Howard | first = Hildegarde | authorlink= Hildegarde Howard | title = An ancestral Golden Eagle raises a question in taxonomy | journal = [[Auk (journal)|The Auk]] | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 287–291 | year = 1947 | url = http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v064n02/p0287-p0291.pdf | doi= 10.2307/4080550}}&lt;/ref&gt; relatively recent specimens – hundreds of thousands to a few million years old – with consistent variations (e.g. always smaller but with the same proportions) as a living species might represent the final step in a chronospecies. This possible identification of the immediate ancestor of the living [[taxon]] may also rely on [[stratigraphic]] information to establish the age of the specimens.

The concept of chronospecies is related to the [[phyletic gradualism]] model of evolution, and also relies on an extensive fossil record, since morphological changes accumulate over time and two very different organisms could be connected by a series of intermediaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13438">'''Computational cognition''' (sometimes referred to as '''computational cognitive science''' or '''computational psychology''') is the study of the [[computation]]al basis of [[education|learning]] and [[inference]] by [[mathematical model]]ing, [[computer simulation]], and [[behaviorism|behavioral]] experiments. In psychology, it is an approach which develops computational models based on experimental results. It seeks to understand the basis behind the human method of [[information processing|processing of information]]. Early on computational cognitive scientists sought to bring back and create a scientific form of [[Franz Brentano|Brentano’s]] psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green, C., &amp; Sokal, Michael M.|first=|date=2000|title=Dispelling the "Mystery" of Computational Cognitive Science|url=|journal=History of Psychology|volume=3 | issue = 1 |pages=62–66|via=|doi=10.1037/1093-4510.3.1.62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial intelligence==
{{Main article|Artificial intelligence}}
There are two main purposes for the productions of artificial intelligence: to produce intelligent behaviors regardless of the quality of the results, and to model after intelligent behaviors found in nature.&lt;ref name="McCorduck"/&gt;  In the beginning of its existence, there was no need for artificial intelligence to emulate the same behavior as human cognition. Until 1960s, economist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] attempted to formalize human problem-solving skills by using the results of psychological studies to develop programs that implement the same problem-solving techniques as people would. Their works laid the foundation for [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic AI]] and computational cognition, and even some advancements for [[cognitive science]] and [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref name="Haugeland"/&gt;

The field of symbolic AI is based on the [[physical symbol systems hypothesis]] by Simon and Newell, which states that expressing aspects of cognitive intelligence can be achieved through the manipulation of [[Physical symbol system|symbols]].&lt;ref name="Crevier"/&gt; However, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] focused more on the initial purpose of artificial intelligence, which is to breakdown the essence of logical and abstract reasoning regardless of whether or not human employs the same mechanism.&lt;ref name="McCorduck"/&gt;

Over the next decades, the progress made in artificial intelligence started to be focused more on developing logic-based and knowledge-based programs, veering away from the original purpose of symbolic AI. Researchers started to believe that artificial intelligence may never be able to imitate some intricate processes of human cognition like [[Machine perception|perception]] or [[Machine learning|learning]]. A chief failing of AI is not being able to achieve a complete likeness to human cognition due to the lack of emotion and the impossibility of implementing it into an AI. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Megill|first=J.|date=2014|title=Emotion, cognition and artificial intelligence.|url=|journal=Minds And Machines|volume=24 | issue = 2 |pages=189–199|via=|doi=10.1007/s11023-013-9320-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;They began to take a “sub-symbolic” approach to create intelligence without specifically representing that knowledge. This movement led to the emerging discipline of [[computational model]]ing, [[connectionism]], and [[computational intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Crevier"/&gt;

==Computational modeling==
{{Main article|Computational model}}
As it contributes more to the understanding of human cognition than artificial intelligence, computational cognitive modeling emerged from the need to define various cognition functionalities (like motivation, emotion, or perception) by representing them in computational models of mechanisms and processes.&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt; Computational models study [[complex system]]s through the use of specific algorithms and extensive [[computational resource]]s, or variables, to produce [[computer simulation]].&lt;ref name="Simulations"/&gt; Simulation is achieved by adjusting the variables, changing one alone or even combining them together, to observe the effect on the outcomes. The results help experimenters make predictions about what would happen in the real system if those similar changes were to occur. &lt;ref&gt; Sun, R. (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. New York: Cambridge University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;

When computational models attempt to mimic human cognitive functioning, all the details of the function must be known for them to transfer and display properly through the models, allowing researchers to thoroughly understand and test an existing theory because no variables are vague and all variables are modifiable. Consider a [[Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model|model of memory built by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968]], it showed how rehearsal leads to long-term memory, where the information being rehearsed would be stored. Despite the advancement it made in revealing the function of memory, this model fails to provide answers to crucial questions like: how much information can be rehearsed at a time? How long does it take for information to transfer from rehearsal to long-term memory? Similarly, other computational models raise more questions about cognition than they answer, making their contributions much less significant for the understanding of human cognition than other cognitive approaches.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"/&gt; An additional shortcoming of computational modeling is its reported lack of objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Restrepo Echavarria|first=R.|date=2009|title=Russell's Structuralism and the Supposed Death of Computational Cognitive Science.|url=|journal=Minds and Machines|volume=19 | issue = 2 |pages=181–197|via=|doi=10.1007/s11023-009-9155-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Anderson]] in his ACT-R uses the functions of computational models and the findings of cognitive science. Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational is based on the theory that the brain consists of several modules which perform specialized functions separate of each other.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"/&gt; The ACT-R model is classified as a [[Cognitivism (psychology)|symbolic]] approach to cognitive science.&lt;ref name="Polk"/&gt;

==Connectionist network==
{{Main article|Connectionism}}
Another approach which deals more with the semantic content of cognitive science is connectionism or neural network modeling. Connectionism relies on the idea that the brain consists of simple units or nodes and the behavioral response comes primarily from the layers of connections between the nodes and not from the environmental stimulus itself.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"/&gt;

Connectionist network differs from computational modeling specifically because of two functions: [[Neural backpropagation|neural back-propagation]] and [[Parallel processing (psychology)|parallel-processing]]. Neural back-propagation is a method utilized by connectionist network to show evidence of learning. After a connectionist network produce a response, the stimulated results are compared to real-life situational results. The feedback provided by the backward propagation of errors would be used to improve accuracy for the network’s subsequent responses.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; The second function, parallel-processing, stemmed from the belief that knowledge and perception are not limited to specific modules but rather are distributed throughout the cognitive networks. The present of parallel distributed processing has been shown in psychological demonstrations like the [[Stroop effect]], where the brain seems to be analyzing the perception of color and meaning of language at the same time.&lt;ref name="Rumelhart"/&gt; However, this theoretical approach has been continually disproved because the two cognitive functions for color-perception and word-forming are operating separately and simultaneously, not parallel of each other.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

The field of cognition may have benefitted from the use of connectionist network but because of the completed system, setting up the neural network models can be quite a tedious task and the results may be less interpretable than the system they are trying to model. Therefore, the results can be used as evidence for broad theory of cognition without explaining the particular process happening within the cognitive function. Other disadvantages of connectionism lie in the research methods it employs or hypothesis it tests, which has been proven inaccurate or ineffective often, taking connectionist models further from an accurate representation of how the brain functions. These issues cause neural network models to be ineffective on studying higher forms of information-processing, and hinder connectionism from advancing the general understanding of human cognition.&lt;ref name="Garson"/&gt;

'''Contour crafting''' is a [[building printing]] technology being researched by [[Behrokh Khoshnevis]] of the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Information Sciences Institute]] (in the [[Viterbi School of Engineering]]) that uses a computer-controlled crane or [[Gantry crane|gantry]] to build edifices rapidly and efficiently with substantially less manual labor. It was originally conceived as a method to construct molds for industrial parts. Khoshnevis decided to adapt the technology for rapid home construction as a way to rebuild after natural disasters, like the devastating earthquakes that have plagued his native [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Using a quick-setting, concrete-like material, contour crafting forms the house's walls layer by layer until topped off by floors and ceilings set in place by the crane.

[[Caterpillar Inc.]] provided funding to help support Viterbi project research in the summer of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=USC – Viterbi School of Engineering
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Singularity University]] graduate students established the ACASA{{clarify|date=August 2013}} project with Khoshnevis as the [[Chief Technical Officer|CTO]] to commercialize Contour Crafting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nextbigfuture.com/2009/08/singularity-university-semester.html|title=Singularity University Semester Completion and Projects|accessdate=October 21, 2014|date=August 28, 2009|publisher=NextBigFuture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Khoshnevis claimed that his system could build a complete home in a single day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its electrically powered crane would produce very little construction material waste. [[Science (TV network)|The Science Channel]]'s ''Discoveries This Week'' program in 2005 reported that, given 3–7 tons of material waste and the exhaust fumes from construction vehicles during standard home construction, contour crafting could significantly reduce environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2013|9|23}}&lt;!-- Sep 2013: so 3 1/2 years later, what's up with the claim?  has it been demonstrated? --&gt;

Khoshnevis stated in 2010 that [[NASA]] was evaluating Contour Crafting for its application in the  construction of bases on [[Colonization of Mars|Mars]] and the [[Colonization of the Moon|Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.media.mit.edu/node/2277
|title=Colloquium with Behrokh Khoshnevis
|accessdate=January 13, 2010
|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After three years, in 2013, [[NASA]] funded a small study at the [[University of Southern California]] to further develop the ''Contour Crafting'' 3D printing technique.  Potential applications of this technology include constructing [[Moon|lunar]] structures of a material that could be built of 90-percent [[Lunar regolith|lunar material]] with only ten percent of the material [[space transport|transported]] from Earth.&lt;ref name=tf20140115&gt;

In 2017 the Contour Crafting Corporation (of which Khoshnevis is the CEO) announced a partnership with and investment from Doka Ventures. In the press release, they claim that they "''will start delivery of the first printers early next year"'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://contourcrafting.com/press-release/|title=New Press Release - CC-Corp|date=2017-06-08|work=CC-Corp|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Data archaeology''' refers to the art and science of recovering [[computer]] [[data]] encoded and/or encrypted in now obsolete [[Computer media|media]] or [[content format|formats]]. Data archaeology can also refer to recovering information from damaged electronic formats after natural or man made disasters.

The term originally appeared in 1993 as part of the [[Global Oceanographic Data Archaeology and Rescue Project]] (GODAR). The original impetus for data archaeology came from the need to recover computerized records of climatic conditions stored on old computer tape, which can provide valuable evidence for testing theories of [[climate change]]. These approaches allowed the reconstruction of an image of the Arctic that had been captured by the [[Nimbus program|Nimbus 2]] satellite on September 23, 1966, in higher resolution than ever seen before from this type of data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsidc.org/monthlyhighlights/january2010.html Techno-archaeology rescues climate data from early satellites] U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), January 2010 [https://www.webcitation.org/5xN1sNyDp Archived]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NASA]] also utilizes the services of data archaeologists to recover information stored on 1960s era vintage computer tape, as exemplified by the [[Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project]] (LOIRP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/LOIRP/ LOIRP Overview] NASA website November 14, 2008 [https://www.webcitation.org/5xN1DjLG4 Archived]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery==
It is also important to make the distinction in data archaeology between data recovery, and data intelligibility. You may be able to recover the data, but not understand it. For data archaeology to be effective the data must be intelligible.&lt;ref name="www.ukoln.ac.uk"&gt; [http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/services/elib/papers/supporting/pdf/p2.pdf] Study on website October 23, 2011 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Disaster recovery===
Data archaeologists can also use [[data recovery]] after natural disasters such as fires, floods, earthquakes, or even hurricanes. For example, in 1995 during [[Hurricane Marilyn]] the National Media Lab assisted the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] in recovering data at risk due to damaged equipment. The hardware was damaged from rain, salt water, and sand, yet it was possible to clean some of the disks and refit them with new cases thus saving the data within.&lt;ref name="www.ukoln.ac.uk"/&gt;

===Recovery techniques===
When deciding whether or not to try and recover data, the cost must be taken into account. If there is enough time and money, most data will be able to be recovered. In the case of [[magnetic media]], which are the most common type used for data storage, there are various techniques that can be used to recover the data depending on the type of damage.&lt;ref name="www.ukoln.ac.uk"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

Humidity can cause tapes to become unusable as they begin to deteriorate and become sticky.  In this case, a heat treatment can be applied to fix this problem, by causing the oils and residues to either be reabsorbed into the tape or evaporate off the surface of the tape.  However, this should only be done in order to provide access to the data so it can be extracted and copied to a medium that is more stable.&lt;ref name="www.ukoln.ac.uk"/&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

Lubrication loss is another source of damage to tapes. This is most commonly caused by heavy use, but can also be a result of improper storage or natural evaporation.  As a result of heavy use, some of the lubricant can remain on the read-write heads which then collect dust and particles.  This can cause damage to the tape.  Loss of lubrication can be addressed by re-lubricating the tapes.  This should be done cautiously, as excessive re-lubrication can cause tape slippage, which in turn can lead to media being misread and the loss of data.&lt;ref name="www.ukoln.ac.uk"/&gt;{{rp|18}}

Water exposure will damage tapes over time.  This often occurs in a disaster situation.  If the media is in salty or dirty water, it should be rinsed in fresh water.  The process of cleaning, rinsing, and drying wet tapes should be done at room temperature in order to prevent heat damage.  Older tapes should be recovered prior to newer tapes, as they are more susceptible to water damage.&lt;ref name="www.ukoln.ac.uk"/&gt;{{rp|18}}

==Prevention==
To prevent the need of data archaeology, creators and holders of digital documents should take care to employ [[digital preservation]].

In ''electronic systems'' a '''diagnostic board''' is a specialized device with diagnostic circuitry on a [[printed circuit board]] that connects to a computer or other electronic equipment replacing an existing module, or plugging into an [[expansion card]] slot.

A multi-board electronic system such as a computer comprises multiple printed circuit boards or cards connected via [[electrical connector|connector]]s. When a fault occurs in the system, it is sometimes possible to isolate or identify the fault by replacing one of the boards with a diagnostic board. A diagnostic board can range from extremely simple to extremely sophisticated.

Simple standard [[POST card|diagnostic plug-in boards for computers]] are available that display numeric codes to assist in identifying issues detected during the [[power-on self-test]] executed automatically during system startup.

==Dummy board==
A dummy board provides a minimal interface. This type of diagnostic board in intended to confirm that the interface is correctly implemented. For example, a PC [[motherboard]] manufacturer can test PCI functionality of a PC motherboard by connecting a dummy [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] board into each PCI slot on the motherboard

==Extender board==
An extender board (or ''board extender, card extender, extender card'') is a simple [[circuit board]] that interposes between a card cage [[backplane]] and the circuit board of interest to physically 'extend' the circuit board of interest out from the card cage allowing access to both sides of the circuit board to connect diagnostic equipment such as an oscilloscope or systems analyzer. For example, a PCI extender board can be plugged into a PCI slot on a computer motherboard, and then a PCI card connected to the extender board to 'extend' the board into free space for access. This approach was common in the 1970s and 1980s particularly on [[S-100 bus]] systems. 

The concept can become unworkable when signal timing is affected by the length of the signal paths on the diagnostic board, as well as introducing Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) into the circuit under test because of a lack of adequate shielding.

The use of extender boards is declining because of the wider use of multilayer flexible circuit boards and overall cheaper components, particularly in the consumer end of the electronics market{{Clarify|date=September 2011|reason=what's the connection?}}.

&lt;!-- USE POSSESSIVE HITCHENS'S IT IS ONE BRITISH VERSION SEE [[MOS:POSS]]#1. --&gt;
'''Hitchens's razor''' is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[Razor (philosophy)|razor]] asserting that the [[Philosophical burden of proof|burden of proof]] regarding the truthfulness of a claim lies with the one who makes the claim, and if this burden is not met, the claim is unfounded, and its opponents need not argue further in order to dismiss it.

==Overview==
The concept is named, echoing [[Occam's razor]], for the journalist and writer [[Christopher Hitchens]], who in a 2003 ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' article formulated it thus: "'''What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence'''".&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/10/mommie_dearest.html|title=Mommie Dearest|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|authorlink=christopher hitchens|work=Slate|date=20 October 2003|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Cillian|last=McGrattan|title=The Politics of Trauma and Peace-Building: Lessons from Northern Ireland|location=Abingdon|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|page=2|isbn=978-1138775183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictum also appears in ''[[God Is Not Great|God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]]'', a book by Hitchens published in 2007.&lt;ref name=God&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|authorlink=Christopher Hitchens|title=God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything|year=2007|page=150|publisher=Twelve Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1843545743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens's razor is actually an English translation of the Latin proverb ''[[:q:en:Latin proverbs#Q|quod grātīs asseritur, grātīs negātur]]'' ("What is freely asserted is freely dismissed"), which was commonly used in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=SkepticInk&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skepticink.com/backgroundprobability/2015/07/25/the-long-history-of-hitchens-razor|title=The Long History of Hitchens' Razor|first=Damion|last=Reinhardt|work=Skeptic Ink|date=25 July 2015|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Jon R. Stone}}, ''The Routledge Dictionary of Latin Quotations'' (2005), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; It takes a stronger stance than the [[Sagan standard]] ("Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"), instead applying to even non-extraordinary claims.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4475">'''Hybrid growth disorders''' refer to reduced growth or overgrowth in an organism that is a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of two different species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brekke|first1=Thomas D.|last2=Good|first2=Jeffrey M.|title=Parent-of-origin growth effects and the evolution of hybrid inviability in dwarf hamsters|journal=Evolution|date=November 2014|volume=68|issue=11|page=3134|doi=10.1111/evo.12500|pmc=4437546}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some sense, it is a type of [[hybrid dysgenesis]] when the growth disorder proves deleterious, making it the opposite of [[Heterosis|heterosis or hybrid vigour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.molbiosci.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-H/hybrid_dysgenesis.html|website=Life Science Glossary|publisher=Northwestern University|accessdate=November 2, 2017|title=Definition-hybrid dysgenesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-81977-3_1|title=Heterosis|last=Jinks|first=J.

Hybrid growth disorders may be referred to as a '''growth dysplasia''', especially when resulting in overgrowth, although this terminology may be confusing since the term [[dysplasia]] is commonly used to imply an impending cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/706780870|title=Dorland's illustrated medical dictionary.|date=2012|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|others=Dorland, W.

Hybrid growth disorders are exhibited among a variety organisms, including [[liger]]s, [[tigon]]s, hybrid mice, and hybrid [[dwarf hamster]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/532895|title=Mammalian hybrids: a check-list with bibliography,|last=P.|first=Gray, Annie|date=1972|publisher=Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux|isbn=0851981704|edition=2d [rev.]|location=Slough,|oclc=532895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paul B.

A study on hybrid mice which investigated the possible causes for hybrid growth disorders reveals [[Imprinting (genetics)|genomic imprinting]] to have a major effect.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Paternal imprinting may increase growth to maximize maternal resources allocated to his progeny, while maternal imprinting may suppress growth in favor of ensuring her own survival and equal allocation of resources between offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/imprinting/|title=Genomic Imprinting|website=learn.genetics.utah.edu|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the extent of a disorder depends on the combination of parental species and their respective sexes, as demonstrated by the Vrana study.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The study concludes that hybrid growth disorders most commonly affect the [[Heterozygote|heterozygous]] sex, as expected by [[Haldane's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haldane|first1=J.B.S.|title=Sex ratio and unisexual sterility in hybrid animals|journal=Journal of Genetics|date=October 1922|volume=12|issue=2|pages=101–109|doi=10.1007/BF02983075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delph|first1=Lynda F.|last2=Demuth|first2=Jeffery P.|title=Haldane's Rule: Genetic Bases and Their Empirical Support|journal=Journal of Heredity|date=September 2016|volume=107|issue=5|pages=383–391|doi=10.1093/jhered/esw026}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would also explain why hybrid growth disorders often appear to affect one sex more than the other.

Similarly, a study of hybrids between dwarf hamster species [[Campbell's dwarf hamster|''Phodopus campbelli'']] and [[Djungarian hamster|''Phodopus sungorus'']] suggests that gene imprinting causes abnormal interactions between growth-promoting and growth-repressing genes which regulate placental and embryonic growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8594">'''International trade and water''' is the relationship between international trade and the water being used by humans. The substantial increase in human population during the 20th century combined with rapid increases in overall global economic development has resulted in rising challenges for the future of public water management.  The developing world has been particularly impacted by the lack of access to clean water. Each year, millions of people die due to illnesses, diseases, and lack the capital to create the infrastructure necessary to combat the problem.&lt;ref&gt;(Segerfeldt 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions have increased the global demand for clean water and in turn, have pressured free market economists to suggest that wealthy market players are the most efficient solution to addressing water issues.&lt;ref&gt;(Saefong 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Several nations can benefit from international trade in water. Particularly nations with excess fresh water and abundant capital are looking forward to making healthy profits from either the export of water to other nations, or are interested in the investment returns they will earn from participation in foreign markets. However, not everyone agrees that market forces are best capable of solving water issues. NGO’s, human rights organizations, and various stakeholders oppose viewing water in economic terms. These individuals accuse international trade agreements and international economic institutions including the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) of attempting to privatize a resource that they consider a basic human right.&lt;ref&gt;(Overbeke 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of a common understanding of whether or not water should be viewed as a commodity or a basic human right has resulted in heated debates among legal professionals and leading members of the academia.

==Water as a commodity==
Prior to the industrial period, water had been extracted by whichever local community lived around it. As the industrial period progressed however, this view began to be replaced by a more economic oriented approach. Today, most water goes through a complicated industrial process that begins with its extraction and ends in a complicated process involving pipes, dams, and other sorts of unnatural facilities. Even fresh water that is located in rivers and lakes must somehow be extracted.  In general these considerations involve the use of land, labor and capital thereby replacing the notion of a common resource into a value based product. [[Desalinization]] and desalinization plants play a major role also.

==International institutions, international trade agreements and water privatization==
In 2000, out of the 40 IMF loans distributed 12 had requirements of partial or full privatization of water supplies.iv Likewise 50 percent of World Bank loans issued in 2002 to developing countries contained a clause that requested privatization of water services.&lt;ref&gt;(Public Citizen.org 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to international institutions pushing for privatization, trade agreements in the 20th century have also created the legal framework for allowing the sale of water. The GATS, known as the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]], operates on a list in approach, meaning it allows privatization in areas that the nation has agreed to open to other members. The [[Doha Development Round]] of negotiations aims at changing this stature. During these negotiations it was declared that no sector is to be excluded from the negotiations to the new agreement. If water services negotiations succeed then once a member chooses to open their markets to their own private sector, then will have to afford other members the same rights to invest in that sector.&lt;ref&gt;(Mann 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Many regional trade agreements do not have a list in approach and are therefore subject to the same conditions mentioned above. For example, in the US-CAFTA agreement only Costa Rica directly specified that water services were to be excluded from foreign investment the other nations made no similar request.&lt;ref&gt;(Mann 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the mixed results obtained from privatization of water services and the difficulty of reversing that decision, several actors have strongly opposed the export of bulk fresh water. These actors claim that once such an action is allowed to occur then it will establish a precedent of treating water just like any other export. This in turn will become legally binding and irreversible.

==International trade and water legal disputes and politics==
Canada is one of the largest owners of fresh water and has for years been engaged in a legal dispute over its possession of the resource. In 1990 an American company named Sunbelt was invited by the government of British Columbia to invest in a water exporting operation. Due to setbacks, the contract never matured and Sunbelt sued the government of British Columbia for failing to meet its obligations. After years of battle the Canadian government declared in 1999 that water in its fresh state as those found in rivers and lakes contains no economic value, and is therefore outside the obligations of its trade agreement.&lt;ref&gt;(Dr. Isabel Al-Assar 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the government cited article XI of GATT (G). This article allows for the conservation of a natural resource as long as the action taken by the government is done in a non-discriminatory manner. Sunbelt however, disagreed with the applicability of this clause and claimed that Canada’s actions are in direct violation of several international trade agreements. Particularly, Sunbelt addressed Article XI of GATT which forbids a member nation from imposing measures other than taxes, levies and other charges on the export of its good. Likewise, Sunbelt argued that the water located in British Columbia belonged to US companies just as much as it belongs to Canadian companies. This argument is based on Article 11 of NAFTA known as the investment chapter. Once water is extracted from its natural state for whatever reason that same right must be given to foreign investors. Sunbelt argues that Canadian companies had such extractions in the past and therefore opened the door for foreign investors to come in and do likewise.

==Turkey-Israel==
In 2002, Israel agreed to buy 1.75 billion cubic feet of water from Turkey every year for a period of 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;(US Water News Online 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The method of transport involved the use of [[Spragg Bag|large plastic bubbles]] that would bring the water to the storage facility. In regards to the talks, the foreign minister of Turkey declared that  this agreement will increase the cooperation between the two countries and also lead to peace and stability in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;(US Water News Online 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Economically Israel concluded that the cost of importing water would be higher than choosing the desalinization option but chose to import anyway. In addition to hoping to achieve peace the foreign minister  also mentioned that the landmark agreement turns water into an internationally accepted ''commodity,'' and that Turkey hopes to sell water to other countries. Turkey canceled the deal after the Gaza Flotilla Raid by IDF commandos  [[Gaza flotilla raid|Gaza Flotilla Raid]] on May 31 2010. During this incident several Turkish nationals were killed by Israeli armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uswaternews.com/archives/arcglobal/4israsign3.html Israel signs agreement to buy water from Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN declaration==
In July 2010, the [[UN General Assembly]] declared that access to clean water and sanitation is a human right. The assembly did not specify whether a public authority or the private sector would be best capable of providing this right.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1339">'''Internet Protocol Device Control''' ('''IPDC''') is a 1998 specification of a [[communications protocol]] for [[voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) telephony, developed by [[Level 3 Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ejub Kajan|title=Information Technology Encyclopedia and Acronyms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XQOrCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA646|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-56262-4|pages=646}}, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;

IPDC divides the operation of telephony gateways between intelligent call routers in an [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) network and simple [[media gateway]]s at the edge of the IP network and the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).

Internet Protocol Device Control was fused with the [[Simple Gateway Control Protocol]] (SGCP), a project independently in progress at [[Bellcore]], to form the [[Media Gateway Control Protocol]] (MGCP). This group of protocols employs the [[media gateway control protocol architecture]] that is also the foundation of [[H.248|MEGACO/H.248]], a similar protocol which became a standards-track protocol at the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).

'''Kate Harvey''' (13 November 1862 – 29 April 1946) was an [[England|English]] suffragist, [[physiotherapist]], and charity worker. Profoundly [[deaf]] and widowed at a young age, she operated a home for women and children, and then later for disabled children. She participated in the [[Women's Tax Resistance League]] and was jailed for her refusal to pay tax if she were not allowed the right to vote. She was the first person imprisoned for failure to pay a tax under the Insurance Act.

==Early life==
Felicia Catherine Glanvill was born on November the 13th, 1862 in [[Peckham]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Doreen A. Woodford, 'A Deaf Fighter for the Rights of Women.' Deaf History Journal, Vol.2 (3) p.7-21)&lt;/ref&gt; She married Frank Harvey and had three daughters, before she was widowed.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}}{{sfn|English Births|1892}} She operated a home in her residence in [[Bromley]] for disabled children and was an early practitioner of physical therapy, at a time when [[Victorian era|Victorian society]] frowned upon women working in medicine, especially in a field which used physical contact.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} 

==Suffrage==
Harvey joined the [[Women's Freedom League|Women's Freedom League (WFL)]]’s Bromley branch and by 1910 was one of the leading members of the organization.{{sfn|Crawford|2013|p=194}} She met and became close friends with [[Charlotte Despard]], another widow involved in charitable works, who operated a home for the poor in [[Wandsworth]]. The exact nature of their relationship is unknown, but Despard recorded in her diary that "the anniversary of our love" began on 12 January 1912.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} Harvey organized the suffrage march which took place in June 1911 as part of the [[Women's Coronation Procession]] for [[George V]]. Despard, who was president of the WFL, led the suffrage march.{{sfn|Dixon|2003|p=1861}}

As early as 1911 Harvey,{{sfn|Eustance|1993|p=177}}{{sfn|''The Vote''|1911|p=105}} who had become a member of the [[Women's Tax Resistance League]], engaged in a protracted battle with the Kent County Council for refusal to pay a stamp tax to obtain a license for her gardener.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} ''The Vote'', the press organ of the WFL gave constant coverage of the conflict over the next two years.{{sfn|Eustance|1993|p=177}} After several months, a warrant was issued for Harvey's arrest and she barricaded herself in her home.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}}{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1913|p=7}} Refusing to pay taxes without having the ability to vote for her representation,{{sfn|''The Vote''|1912|p=231}} after eight months, the barricade was broken and some of her property was seized in lieu of payment of the tax. A year later, having built stronger barricades and still refusing to pay, bailiffs broke through using a battering ram.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} Harvey was arrested and taken to the Bromley Police Court in August 1913, where she was ordered to pay fines under the Insurance Act. She refused to pay and was sentenced to serve two months in [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway Prison]].{{sfn|''The Times''|1913|p=4}} She was the first person sentenced under the Insurance Act, though two other suffragists had been imprisoned for failure to pay taxes in previous years{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1913|p=7}} for such things as dog licenses, carriage duties and inhabitant taxes.{{sfn|Eustance|1993|p=177}} Protests to her arrest, attended by both men and women, cited the inequity of her fines being much higher than those imposed upon men for the same offence.{{sfn|''The Guardian''|1913|p=7}} After serving only one month of her sentence, Harvey was released because of concerns for her health.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} In November, authorities attempted to auction her belongings to pay her fines, but were forced to close the sale when no bids were made.{{sfn|''The Observer''|1913|p=14}} She was awarded a medal from suffragists depicting the entry of Holloway Prison.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}}{{sfn|Vallely|2005}}

During the war, most suffragists suspended the campaign for enfranchisement, but Harvey and Despard, continued to press for reform and were ardent pacifists, speaking against war.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} The pair attended the [[Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|Seventh Conference]] of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] in [[Budapest]] and were interested in promoting the international feminist movement.{{sfn|Eustance|1993|p=247}} Both were also involved in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] movement, believing that moral and spiritual development of the individual would result in societal change.{{sfn|Eustance|1993|p=205}} Harvey was described as "intensely pious" and conducted religious instruction for the children in her care in a chapel she built in her home.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}} In 1916, Harvey and Despard bought a large house together, along with two cottages and a wood shed on twelve acres of land in [[Upper Hartfield]] at the edge of the [[Ashdown Forest]]. Naming the facility "Kurundai", they created a thirty-one-bed hospital for women and children.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}} Though initially Despard paid expenses for some of the hospital patients,{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} in 1917, the [[Theosophical Society]] became involved and the home was renamed as the Brackenhill Theosophical Home School. It housed children from broken homes, illegitimate children, as well as those who were sick or disabled and was directed by Harvey.{{sfn|Dixon|2003|p=5}} In 1920, the Theosophical Society withdrew their support and moved the Theosophical Home School to the Old Rectory in [[Letchworth]]{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=17}} but Harvey continued operating the facility at Kurundai.{{#tag:ref|The naming is confusing as there were two facilities with this name. Brackenhill's name apparently followed the school supported by the Theosophical Society, which later became [[St Christopher School, Letchworth]]. In 1925 a decision was made to close the theosophical school and use the facility to house the faculty for St. Christopher. When Harvey resumed directorship of her property in 1928, she called her boarding school the Brackenhill Open Air Home School, which had no relationship to the earlier organization.{{sfn|Baigent|Cursons|2015}}|group="Notes"}} In 1921, Harvey and Despard split up after nine years together when Despard moved to Ireland.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}} Harvey maintained sole ownership of the facility, but between 1923 and 1928 it was operated by the Invalid Children’s Aid Association as a convalescent center for children who had [[rheumatic diseases]] and she moved to a house near the facility known as "Wroth Tyes".{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}}

In 1928, Harvey took over management again and converted Kurundai to a [[boarding school]], which she called Brackenhill Open Air Home School.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}}{{sfn|Baigent|Cursons|2015}} An open-air, facility, she focused on vegetarianism and physical exercise, providing the children with a "natural" life where they slept in the open air in shuttered shelters. The sides of the roofed dwellings only were shuttered in extremely poor weather. She continued to live at Wroth Tyes with the headmistress of the school, Helen Smith. The two women operated the school until the advent of the [[WWII|Second World War]], when the government repurposed the estate for the war effort.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}}

==Death and legacy==
Harvey died at Wroth Tyes, in [[Hartfield]], [[East Sussex]], England on 29 April 1946 and left the Brackenhill property to Smith.{{sfn|Wojtczak|2008|p=257-258}}{{sfn|''The London Gazette''|1946|p=4615}} In 2005, Harvey's suffragette medal was auctioned by [[Bonhams]] bringing £840 and renewed interest in the suffragette.{{sfn|Vallely|2005}}

{{Merge|Mineral_painting|date=September 2018|discuss=Talk:Keim's process#Merge with Mineral_painting}}
'''Keim's process''' is a technique of [[fresco]] preparation and painting intended to maximize the lifetime of the finished work. The process, as reported in 1884 at the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in London, was created by chemist and craftsman Adolf Wilhelm Keim of [[Munich]], as an improvement on the earlier [[stereochromy]] technique of Schlotthaner and [[Johann Nepomuk von Fuchs]].&lt;ref name="rivington"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rivington | first = J.

==The process==
*First, the surface to be painted is prepared by removing any damp bricks, overly burnt bricks, or decayed wood, and replacing these, and also removing any existing traces of [[stucco]].
*The surface is then coated with a mixture of [[quartz]] sand, infusorial earth (calcined fossil meal), and powdered [[marble]], mixed four parts to one with [[quicklime]] [[calcium hydroxide|slaked]] with [[distilled water]]. The purpose of this layer is to ensure adhesion of the subsequent layers to the surface. Next, a layer of lime-sand [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] is applied to even the surface, with care taken to avoid cracking. This layer is allowed to dry for up to a year.
*Once dry, a painting ground composed of white quartz sand, marble sand, marble meal, and infusorial earth is combined eight parts to one with slaked lime, and applied to the surface at a thickness of one eighth to one quarter inch. This layer dries for several days, at which point a crust of [[carbonate]] has formed on the surface. This crust is removed with a mixture of one part [[hydrofluosilicic acid]] to three parts distilled water, which is brushed on and allowed to dry for 24 hours, after which the surface is rinsed with distilled water.
*A hardening fluid of one part [[potassium silicate]] to two parts water is then brushed on and allowed to dry for 24 hours, before a second layer is applied and allowed to dry again. This surface may be painted immediately, or may sit unpainted for several years.
*[[Pigment]]s (selected from a set of thirty-eight) are treated with [[alkaline]] solutions of [[potash]] or [[ammonia]] to prevent color change caused by the alkaline [[fixative (drawing)|fixative]] to come. Alternative pigments are best for those that cannot be used with an alkaline fixative.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt;
*Finally, the completed painting is fixed with an application of "[[waterglass]]" (sodium silicate) treated with [[ammonium carbonate]], applied in a fine spray in several layers, until no more is absorbed. The chemical interaction of the fixative with the underlying pigments and ground create a material analogous to marble, and highly resistant to chemical corrosion.&lt;ref name="builder"/&gt;

Keim's focus on carefully preparing the painting ground came from his study of older frescos and their state of preservation.&lt;ref name="osgood"&gt;{{cite book | last = Osgood | first = J. R. | author2 = et. al. | title = American Architect and Architecture | publisher = | volume = 15 | date = 1884 | pages = 125 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qJgwAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=%22Keim%27s+process%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=37GXMOD6PY&amp;sig=iOtL0ckgLyy6mHUqXfpvspHh6HE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Aps9VIbZHcv8sAS_u4KoCA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Keim's%20process%22&amp;f=false | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keim reportedly labored for twelve years to refine his process.&lt;ref name="builder"/&gt;

The '''Machine Age'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RgQ3pHd1d-UC&amp;pg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;f=false Mentality and freedom By William Armstrong Fairburn. Page 219.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CwxAtq3LaLkC&amp;pg=PA601#v=onepage&amp;f=false The Playground, Volume 15 By Playground and Recreation Association of America]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CwxAtq3LaLkC&amp;pg=PA601#v=onepage&amp;f=false Public libraries, Volume 6]&lt;/ref&gt; is an era that includes the early 20th century, sometimes also including the late 19th century. An approximate dating would be about 1880 to 1945. Considered to be at a peak in the time between the [[World War I|first]] and [[World War II|second]] world wars, it forms a late part of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. The 1940s saw the beginning of the [[Atomic Age]], where [[modern physics]] saw new applications such as the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalcentury.com/1944.html&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[computer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/ABC/Articles/First-computer.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519100021/http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/ABC/Articles/First-computer.html |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[transistor]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cedmagic.com/history/transistor-1947.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Digital Revolution]] ended the intellectual model of the machine age founded in the mechanical and heralding a new more complex model of [[high technology]].  The digital era has been called the [[The Second Machine Age|Second Machine Age]], with its increased focus on machines that do mental tasks.

'''The Mshatta Facade''' is the decorated part of the [[facade]] of the 8th century [[Umayyad]] residential palace of [[Qasr Mshatta]], one of the [[Desert Castles of Jordan]], which is now installed in the south wing of the [[Pergamon Museum]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It is part of the permanent exhibition of the [[Pergamon Museum of Islamic Art]] dedicated to [[Islamic art]] from the 8th to the 19th centuries.  This was only a relatively small section of the full length of the facade, surrounding the main entrance; most of the wall was undecorated and remains ''in situ''.

The facade belonged to the Qasr Mshatta or Mshatta palace, which was excavated about 30&amp;nbsp;km south of the contemporary Jordanian capital of [[Amman]]. It is thought to have served as a winter residence and storage halls during the [[Umayyad]] period. The building of the palace probably dates to the era of the [[caliph]] [[Al-Walid II]] (743-744). After Al Walid was murdered, it was left incomplete and later ruined in an [[earthquake]].  The sections of the outer wall remaining ''in situ'' are much plainer.

Unusually for an Umayyad building, the main structures are built from burnt bricks resting on a foundation layer of finely dressed stone; the carved facade is also in stone. The name of the place, Mshatta, is a name used by the modern [[Bedouin]]s in the area, and the original name remains unknown.

The remains of the palace were excavated in 1840. The facade was a gift from the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] to Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany]]. A large part of it was brought to the then [[Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum]] (now the [[Bode Museum]]) in Berlin in 1903. It was reconstructed as a 33 metres long, 5 metres high facade, with two towers, and parts of a central gateway.  In 1932 it was reconstructed in the Pergamon Museum. It was seriously damaged during the Second World War and the bombardment of Berlin. Today, it is one of the most important exhibits of the ''Museum für Islamische Kunst'' in the [[Pergamon Museum]], and a key monument of early [[Islamic art]] and architecture, demonstrating early forms of the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], [[millefleur]] and also animals carved in [[relief]].

There has been much discussion of the fact that the decoration on the left side of the facade contains many animals among the foliar forms, while on the right of the entranceway in the centre there are no animals. It has been suggested that this is because the right-hand side was the outside wall of the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ettinghausen, [[Oleg Grabar]] and Marilyn Jenkins-Madina, 2001, ''Islamic Art and Architecture: 650-1250'', 50, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-08869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NASA Star and Exoplanet Database''' ('''NStED''') is an on-line astronomical stellar and exoplanet catalog and data service that collates and cross-correlates [[astronomy|astronomical]] data and information on [[exoplanet]]s and their host [[star]]s. NStED is dedicated to collecting and serving important public data sets involved in the search for and characterization of exoplanets and their host stars. The data include stellar parameters (such as positions, magnitudes, and temperatures), exoplanet parameters (such as masses and orbital parameters) and discovery/characterization data (such as published radial velocity curves, photometric light curves, images, and spectra).

The NStED collects and serves public data to support the search for and characterization of extra-solar planets (exoplanets) and their host stars. The data include published light curves, images, spectra and parameters, and time-series data from surveys that aim to discover transiting exoplanets. All data are validated by the NStED science staff and traced to their sources. NStED is the U.S. data portal for the CoRoT mission.

As of December 2011, SDtED is no longer in operation. Most data and services have been transferred to the [[NASA Exoplanet Archive]].

==Search characteristics==
Data are searchable either for an individual star or by stellar and planetary properties.

NStED offers direct access to frequently accessed tables:

==Survey programs==
NStED also serves photometric time-series data from surveys that aim to discover transiting exoplanets such as ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'' and the [[COROT|CoRoT]].
NStED provides access to over 500,000 light curves from space and ground-based exoplanet transit survey programs, including:

* [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]
* [[COROT|CoRoT]]
* [[HATNet Project]]
* [[Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey]]
* [[South African Astronomical Observatory#KELT-South|KELT]]

The transit survey data are linked to an online periodogram service that can be used to search for periods in the transit survey data sets.  A user can also upload their own time series data to search for periods in their own data.

The planetary orbital parameters are linked to an online [https://web.archive.org/web/20110519110405/http://nsted.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TransitSearch/exotransits.html  transit ephemeris prediction tool] which can be used to predict the probability that an exoplanet may transit and the date/time and observability of the transits.

The '''National Nanotechnology Initiative''' is a [[United States]] federal government program for the [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[technology]] [[research and development]] for [[nanoscale]] projects. “The NNI serves as the central point of communication, cooperation, and collaboration for all Federal agencies engaged in nanotechnology research, bringing together the expertise needed to advance this broad and complex field.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the NNI {{!}} Nano|url=http://nano.gov/about-nni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiative participants (cited below) state that its four goals are to

# advance a world-class nanotechnology research and development (R&amp;D) program;
# foster the transfer of new technologies into products for commercial and public benefit;
# develop and sustain educational resources, a skilled workforce, and the supporting infrastructure and tools to advance nanotechnology; and
# support responsible development of nanotechnology.

== History ==

[[Mihail C. Roco]] proposed the initiative in a 1999 presentation to the White House in the Clinton administration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/eng/staff/mroco.jsp Dr. Mihail C. Roco: Senior Advisor for Nanotechnology, National Science Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411141651/https://www.nsf.gov/eng/staff/mroco.jsp |date=11 April 2010 }} at NSF Directorate of Engineering website&lt;/ref&gt;; &lt;ref&gt; M.C.

President [[Bill Clinton]] advocated [[nanotechnology]] development. In a 21 January 2000 speech [http://pr.caltech.edu/events/presidential_speech/] at the [[California Institute of Technology]], Clinton stated that "Some of our research goals may take twenty or more years to achieve, but that is precisely why there is an important role for the federal government."

President [[George W. Bush]] further increased funding for nanotechnology.  On December 3, 2003 Bush [[signed into law]] the '''21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act''' (Public Law 108-153 [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ153.108]), which authorizes expenditures for five of the participating agencies totaling $3.63 billion over four years.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927072326/http://www.nano.gov/html/res/Sen.AllenNational_Nanotechnology_Initiative_Conference_4.1.04.htm].  This law is an [[authorization]], not an [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]], and subsequent appropriations for these five agencies have not met the goals set out in the 2003 Act. However, there are many agencies involved in the Initiative that are not covered by the Act, and requested budgets under the Initiative for all participating agencies in Fiscal Years 2006 - 2015 totaled over $1 billion each.

In February 2014, the National Nanotechnology Initiative released a Strategic Plan outlining updated goals and "program component areas" [http://nano.gov/sites/default/files/pub_resource/2014_nni_strategic_plan.pdf]," as required under the terms of the Act. This document supersedes the NNI Strategic Plans released in 2004 and 2007.

The NNI's budget supplement proposed by the Obama administration for Fiscal Year 2015 provides $1.5 billion in requested funding. The cumulative NNI investment since fiscal year 2001, including the 2015 request, totals almost $21 billion. Cumulative investments in nanotechnology-related environmental, health, and safety research since 2005 now total nearly $900 million. The Federal agencies with the largest investments are the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Department of Defense, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nano.gov/2015BudgetSupplement NNI Supplement to the President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silver-McLean teaching-methodology.png|thumb]]
'''Pete Silver &amp; Will McLean''' are two British architectural practitioners, educators, writers, and technical theorists who work together as a duo. They have taught at the [[Architectural Association]], [[The Bartlett]] ([[University College London]]), and The [[University of Westminster]]'s School of Architecture and the Built environment, thus gaining a privileged position in the contemporary London architectural scene.

==Background==
Will McLean is a Doctor of Philosophy and artist [[Bruce McLean]]&lt;ref&gt;Bruce McLean has been engaging with architecture for over twenty years through an ongoing collaboration with [[Will Alsop]] on such buildings as the proposed 151 City Road, London: http://www.skyscrapernews.com/news.php?ref=866&lt;/ref&gt;'s son. He trained at the [[Architectural Association]] under [[Will Alsop]] OBE RA and Professor [[John Frazer (architect)|John Frazer]]. McLean has worked on a series of projects with Bruce McLean, most notably Dalry Primary School in North Ayrshire completed in 2007 (www.primaryspace.net), and with US architect and artist Adam Kalkin,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.architectureandhygiene.com (free download)&lt;/ref&gt; working on such projects as 'Quik Build' container housing. He has had a regular feature, covering technical innovations, in Architectural Design magazine - McLean's Nuggets, and is an Editor of Construction History - the International Journal of the Construction History Society[[File:Dalry.jpg|thumb|Dalry Primary School]]
Pete Silver worked for Solon [[Housing Association]] in South London with architects such as [[Patrick Keiller]], [[Edward Cullinan]] and [[Walter Segal]]. He trained at the [[Architectural Association]] under Professors [[John Frazer (architect)|John Frazer]] and [[Gordon Pask]], and became a researcher in the Land Use Research Unit at [[King's College London]], gaining a unique insight into Professor [[Alice Coleman]]'s groundbreaking, if controversial work, on post-war housing [[urban regeneration|regeneration]]. Silver is a director of the Chartered Practice Architects (CPA) Ltd. His current work involves prototyping new structural (diagrid) frameworks from torsional elastic helixes.
[[File:R0018207.JPG|thumb|Torsional Diagrid]]

==Collaborative career==
In 2001, Silver and McLean joined the School of Architecture and the Built environment at the [[University of Westminster]] where they jointly head the Technical Studies Department.&lt;!-- TEACHING ETHOS. --&gt; 
They have co-authored four architecture books: ''Fabrication: the designer's guide'' (Architectural Press), ''Introduction to Architectural Technology'' (Laurence King Publishing - available in 7 languages), ''Structural Engineering for Architects: A Handbook'' (Laurence King Publishing, co-authored with engineer Peter Evans - available in 4 languages) and Air Structures (Laurence King Publishing).
They co-curate a highly successful public lecture series,

[[Image:Pitch class on C.png|thumb|right|All Cs from C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; inclusive{{audio|Pitch class on C.mid|Play}}.]]

In [[music]], a '''pitch class''' ('''p.c.''' or '''pc''') is a [[set (music)|set]] of all [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] that are a whole number of [[octave]]s apart, e.g., the pitch class C consists of the Cs in all octaves. "The pitch class C stands for all possible Cs, in whatever octave position."&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Whittall]], ''The Cambridge Introduction to Serialism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008): 276. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68200-8}} (pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; Important to [[musical set theory]], a pitch class is, "all pitches related to each other by octave, [[Enharmonic|enharmonic equivalence]], or both."&lt;ref&gt;Don Michael Randel, ed. (2003). "Set theory", ''The Harvard Dictionary of Music'', p.776. Harvard. {{ISBN|9780674011632}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, using [[scientific pitch notation]], the pitch class "C" is the set

:{C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''n'' is an [[integer]]} = {..., C&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ...};

although there is no formal upper or lower limit to this sequence, only a limited number of these pitches are audible to the human ear. 
Pitch class is important because human [[Pitch (psychophysics)|pitch-perception]] is [[Periodic function|periodic]]: pitches belonging to the same pitch class are perceived as having a similar quality or color, a property called "[[octave equivalence]]".

Psychologists refer to the quality of a pitch as its "chroma".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dmitri Tymoczko|Tymoczko, Dmitri]] (2011). ''A Geometry of Music: Harmony and Counterpoint in the Extended Common Practice'', p.30. Oxford Studies in Music Theory. {{ISBN|9780199714353}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''chroma'' is an attribute of pitches (as opposed to ''tone height''), just like [[hue]] is an attribute of [[color]]. A ''pitch class'' is a set of all pitches that share the same chroma, just like "the set of all white things" is the collection of all white objects.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Meinard (2007). ''Information Retrieval for Music and Motion'', p.60. {{ISBN|9783540740483}}. "A pitch class is defined to be the set of all pitches that share the same chroma."&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that in standard Western [[equal temperament]], distinct spellings can refer to the same sounding object: B{{music|sharp}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and D{{music|bb}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; all refer to the same pitch, hence share the same chroma, and therefore belong to the same pitch class; a phenomenon called [[enharmonic|enharmonic equivalence]].

==Integer notation==
To avoid the problem of enharmonic spellings, theorists typically represent pitch classes using numbers beginning from zero, with each successively larger integer representing a pitch class that would be one semitone higher than the preceding one, if they were all realised as actual pitches in the same octave. Because octave-related pitches belong to the same class, when an octave is reached, the numbers begin again at zero. This cyclical system is referred to as [[modular arithmetic]] and, in the usual case of chromatic twelve-tone scales, pitch-class numbering is regarded as "modulo 12" (customarily abbreviated "mod 12" in the music-theory literature)—that is, every twelfth member is identical. One can map a pitch's fundamental frequency ''f'' (measured in [[hertz]]) to a real number ''p'' using the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;p = 9 + 12\log_2 \frac{f}{440\text{ Hz}}&lt;/math&gt;

This creates a linear [[pitch space]] in which octaves have size 12, [[semitone]]s (the distance between adjacent keys on the piano keyboard) have size 1, and [[middle C]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is assigned the number 0 (thus, the pitches on [[piano]] are −39 to +48). Indeed, the mapping from pitch to real numbers defined in this manner forms the basis of the [[MIDI Tuning Standard]], which uses the real numbers from 0 to 127 to represent the pitches C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; to G&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (thus, middle C is 60). To represent pitch ''classes'', we need to identify or "glue together" all pitches belonging to the same pitch class&amp;mdash;i.e.&amp;nbsp;all numbers ''p'' and ''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;12. The result is a cyclical [[quotient group]] that musicians call [[pitch class space]] and mathematicians call '''R'''/12'''Z'''. Points in this space can be labelled using [[real number]]s in the range 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;12. These numbers provide numerical alternatives to the letter names of elementary music theory: 

:0 = C, 1 = C{{music|#}}/D{{music|b}}, 2 = D, 2.5 = D{{music|t}} ([[quarter tone]] sharp), 3 = D{{music|#}}/E{{music|b}},

and so on. In this system, pitch classes represented by integers are classes of [[12 equal temperament|twelve-tone equal temperament]] (assuming standard concert A).

[[Image:Integer notation.png|thumb|right|350px|Integer notation.]]

In [[music]], '''integer notation''' is the translation of pitch classes and/or [[interval class]]es into [[integer|whole numbers]].&lt;ref name="Whittall"&gt;Whittall (2008), p.273.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if C&amp;nbsp;= 0, then C{{music|#}}&amp;nbsp;= 1 ... A{{music|#}}&amp;nbsp;= 10, B&amp;nbsp;= 11, with "10" and "11" substituted by "t" and "e" in some sources,&lt;ref name="Whittall"/&gt; ''A'' and ''B'' in others&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Morris, "Generalizing Rotational Arrays", ''Journal of Music Theory'' 32, no. 1 (Spring 1988): 75–132, citation on 83.&lt;/ref&gt; (like the [[duodecimal]] numeral system, which also uses "t" and "e", or ''A'' and ''B'', for "10" and "11"). This allows the most economical presentation of information regarding [[post-tonal]] materials.&lt;ref name="Whittall"/&gt;

In the integer model of pitch, all pitch classes and [[interval (music)|interval]]s between pitch classes are designated using the numbers 0 through 11. It is not used to notate music for performance, but is a common [[musical analysis|analytical]] and [[musical composition|compositional]] tool when working with chromatic music, including [[twelve tone technique|twelve tone]], [[serialism|serial]], or otherwise [[atonality|atonal]] music.

Pitch classes can be notated in this way by assigning the number 0 to some note and assigning consecutive integers to consecutive [[semitone]]s; so if 0 is C natural, 1 is C{{Music|sharp}}, 2 is D{{Music|natural}} and so on up to 11, which is B{{Music|natural}}. The C above this is not 12, but 0 again (12&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;12&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0). Thus arithmetic [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 12 is used to represent [[octave]] [[Equivalence class (music)|equivalence]]. One advantage of this system is that it ignores the "spelling" of notes (B{{Music|sharp}}, C{{Music|natural}} and D{{Music|doubleflat}} are all 0) according to their [[diatonic functionality]].

===Disadvantages===
&lt;!--1st disadvantage--&gt;There are a few disadvantages with integer notation. First, theorists have traditionally used the same integers to indicate elements of different tuning systems. Thus, the numbers 0, 1, 2,&amp;nbsp;... 5, are used to notate pitch classes in 6-tone equal temperament. This means that the meaning of a given integer changes with the underlying tuning system: "1" can refer to C{{music|#}} in 12-tone equal temperament, but D in 6-tone equal temperament.

&lt;!--2nd disadvantage--&gt;Also, the same numbers are used to represent both [[pitch (music)|pitches]] and [[interval (music)|intervals]]. For example, the number 4 serves both as a label for the pitch class E (if C&amp;nbsp;= 0) and as a label for the ''distance'' between the pitch classes D and F{{music|#}}. (In much the same way, the term "10 degrees" can label both a temperature and the distance between two temperatures.) Only one of these labelings is sensitive to the (arbitrary) choice of pitch class 0. For example, if one makes a different choice about which pitch class is labeled 0, then the pitch class E will no longer be labeled "4". However, the distance between D and F{{music|#}} will still be assigned the number 4. Both this and the issue in the paragraph directly above may be viewed as disadvantages (though mathematically, an element "4" should not be confused with the function "+4").

The system described above is flexible enough to describe any pitch class in any tuning system: for example, one can use the numbers {0, 2.4, 4.8, 7.2, 9.6} to refer to the five-tone scale that divides the octave evenly. However, in some contexts, it is convenient to use alternative labeling systems.  For example, in [[just intonation]], we may express pitches in terms of positive rational numbers {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}}, expressed by reference to a 1 (often written "{{sfrac|1|1}}"), which represents a fixed pitch. If ''a'' and ''b'' are two positive rational numbers, they belong to the same pitch class if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} = 2^n&lt;/math&gt;

for some [[integer]] ''n''. Therefore, we can represent pitch classes in this system using ratios {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}} where neither ''p'' nor ''q'' is divisible by 2, that is, as ratios of odd integers. Alternatively, we can represent just intonation pitch classes by reducing to the octave, 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''p''|''q''}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2.

It is also very common to label pitch classes with reference to some [[Scale (music)|scale]].  For example, one can label the pitch classes of ''n''-tone [[equal temperament]] using the integers 0 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. In much the same way, one could label the pitch classes of the C major scale, C–D–E–F–G–A–B, using the numbers from 0 to 6.  This system has two advantages over the continuous labeling system described above.  First, it eliminates any suggestion that there is something natural about a twelvefold division of the octave.  Second, it avoids pitch-class universes with unwieldy decimal expansions when considered relative to 12; for example, in the continuous system, the pitch-classes of [[19 equal temperament]] are labeled 0.63158..., 1.26316..., etc. Labeling these pitch classes {0, 1, 2, 3 ..., 18} simplifies the arithmetic used in pitch-class set manipulations.

The disadvantage of the scale-based system is that it assigns an infinite number of different names to chords that sound identical.  For example, in twelve-tone equal-temperament the C major triad is notated {0, 4, 7}.  In twenty-four-tone equal-temperament, this same triad is labeled {0, 8, 14}.  Moreover, the scale-based system appears to suggest that different tuning systems use steps of the same size ("1") but have octaves of differing size ("12" in 12-tone equal-temperament, "19" in 19-tone equal temperament, and so on), whereas in fact the opposite is true: different tuning systems divide the same octave into different-sized steps.

In general, it is often more useful to use the traditional integer system when one is working within a single temperament; when one is comparing chords in different temperaments, the continuous system can be more useful.

In [[mathematical logic]], a '''predicate''' is commonly understood to be a [[Boolean-valued function]] ''P'': ''X''→ {true, false}, called the predicate on ''X''. However, predicates have many different uses and interpretations in mathematics and logic, and their precise definition, meaning and use will vary from theory to theory. So, for example, when a theory defines the concept of a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]], then a predicate is simply the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] (otherwise known as the [[indicator function]]) of a relation.  However, not all theories have relations, or are founded on [[set theory]], and so one must be careful with the proper definition and semantic interpretation of a predicate.

==Simplified overview==
Informally, a predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Daniel W.|title=A Logical Introduction to Proof|year=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781461436317|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIf3CkTPPjMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It can be thought of as an operator or function that returns a value that is either true or false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haas|first=Guy M.|title=What If? (Predicates)|url=http://www.bfoit.org/itp/Predicates.html|work=Introduction to Computer Programming|publisher=Berkeley Foundation for Opportunities in IT (BFOIT)|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, predicates are sometimes used to indicate set membership: when talking about sets, it is sometimes inconvenient or impossible to describe a set by listing all of its elements. Thus, a predicate ''P(x)'' will be true or false, depending on whether ''x'' belongs to a set.

Predicates are also commonly used to talk about the [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of objects, by defining the set of all objects that have some property in common. So, for example, when ''P'' is a predicate on ''X'', one might sometimes say ''P'' is a [[Property (philosophy)|property]] of ''X''.  Similarly, the notation ''P''(''x'') is used to denote a sentence or statement ''P'' concerning the variable object x. The set defined by ''P''(''x'') is written as {''x'' | ''P''(''x'')}, and is the set of objects for which ''P'' is true.

For instance, {''x'' | ''x'' is a natural number less than 4} is the set {1,2,3}.

If ''t'' is an element of the set {''x'' | ''P''(''x'')}, then the statement ''P''(''t'') is ''true''.

Here, ''P''(''x'') is referred to as the ''predicate'', and ''x'' the ''placeholder'' of the ''[[proposition]]''. Sometimes, ''P''(''x'') is also called a ([[Template processor|template]] in the role of)  [[propositional function]], as each choice of the placeholder ''x'' produces a proposition.

A simple form of predicate is a [[Boolean expression]], in which case the inputs to the expression are themselves Boolean values, combined using Boolean operations. Similarly, a Boolean expression with inputs predicates is itself a more complex predicate.

== Formal definition==
The precise semantic interpretation of an [[atomic formula]] and an atomic sentence will vary from theory to theory.

* In [[propositional logic]], atomic formulas are called [[propositional variable]]s.&lt;ref name=lavrov&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavrov|first=Igor Andreevich|first2=Larisa|last2=Maksimova|author2-link= Larisa Maksimova |title=Problems in Set Theory, Mathematical Logic, and the Theory of Algorithms|year=2003|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=0306477122|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPLjjjU1C9AC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a sense, these are nullary (i.e. 0-[[arity]]) predicates. 
* In [[first-order logic]], an atomic formula consists of a predicate symbol applied to an appropriate number of terms. 
* In [[set theory]], predicates are understood to be [[Indicator function|characteristic functions]] or set [[indicator function]]s, ''i.e.'' [[function (mathematics)|functions]] from a set element to a [[truth value]].  [[Set-builder notation]] makes use of predicates to define sets.
* In [[autoepistemic logic]], which rejects the [[law of excluded middle]], predicates may be true, false, or simply ''unknown''; ''i.e.'' a given collection of facts may be insufficient to determine the truth or falsehood of a predicate.
* In [[fuzzy logic]], predicates are the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic functions]] of a [[probability distribution]]. That is, the strict true/false valuation of the predicate is replaced by a quantity interpreted as the degree of truth.

'''Prehistoric archaeology''' is the study of the past before historical records began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=1662101 |pmid=17758391 |title=Prehistoric Archeology, Past, Present and Future |first=N. C. |last=Nelson |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=85 |issue=2195 |date=22 January 1937 |pages=81-89 |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |doi=10.1126/science.85.2195.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a field of research that looks at all the pre-urban societies of the world. It also has distinctive set of procedures for analyzing material remains so that archaeologists can reconstruct their ecological settings. The study of prehistoric archaeology reflects the cultural concerns of modern society by showing interpretations of time between economic growth and political stability.&lt;ref name=Fagan&gt;{{cite book |year=1996 |title=The Oxford Companion to Archaeology |first=Brian M. |last=Fagan |author-link=Brian M. Fagan |edition=1st |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199891085 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780195076189.001.0001 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=ystMAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |oclc=35178577}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has very close links with biology, biological anthropology, and geology.&lt;ref name=Fagan/&gt; It is also sometimes termed at anthropological archaeology because of its indirect traces with complex patterns.&lt;ref name=Fagan/&gt;

In Western Europe the prehistoric period generally ends with [[Roman empire|Roman]] colonisation although in many other places, notably [[Egypt]] and [[China]], it finishes much earlier and in others, such as [[Australia]], much later. A transitional phase of [[protohistory]] or [[protohistoric archaeology]] may exist where written records provide a limited picture of the society in question.

The earliest record of the word ''prehistoric'' comes from the French archaeologist and scientist [[Paul Tournal]] who used it in 1831 to describe the finds he made in ancient caves he had investigated in the [[Bize-Minervois]] in the south of France. It did not enter English as an archeological term until 1851 when it was used by the Scots-Canadian archaeologist Sir [[Daniel Wilson (academic)|Daniel Wilson]]. The [[three-age system]], which just predates the coining of the term, was created in an attempt to make sense of the chronology of prehistoric Europe.

Without history to provide evidence for names, places and motivations, prehistoric archaeologists speak in terms of [[archaeological culture|culture]]s which can only be given arbitrary modern names relating to the locations of known occupation sites or the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s used. It is naturally much easier to discuss societies rather than individuals as these past people are completely anonymous in the archaeological record.

Such a lack of concrete information means that prehistoric archaeology is a contentious field and the arguments that rage over it have done much to inform [[archaeological theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/CMPL/article/viewFile/43364/41036 |title=Why the history of archaeology is essential to theoretical archaeology |first=Tim |last=Murray |author-link=Tim Murray (archaeologist) |journal=Complutum |date=17 June 2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=21-31 |issn=1131-6993 |doi=10.5209/rev_CMPL.2013.v24.n2.43364 |format=PDF |access-date=2 October 2018 |publisher=[[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of theories regarding the purpose of objects or sites for example obliges archaeologists to adopt a critical approach to all evidence and to examine their own constructs of the past. [[Structural functionalism]] and [[processualism]] are two schools of archaeological thought which have made a great contribution to prehistoric archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2798577 |title=Major Concepts of Archaeology in Historical Perspective |first=Bruce G. |last=Trigger |author-link=Bruce G.

{{sociology}}
'''Rational-legal authority''' (also known as '''rational authority''', '''legal authority''', '''rational domination''', '''legal domination''', or '''bureaucratic authority''') is a form of [[leadership]] in which the [[authority]] of an [[organization]] or a ruling [[regime]] is largely tied to legal [[rationality]], [[Legitimacy (political science)|legal legitimacy]] and [[bureaucracy]]. The majority of the modern [[State (polity)|states]] of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are rational-legal authorities, according to those who use this form of classification.

==Rational-legal authority==
In [[sociology]], the concept of rational-legal domination comes from [[Max Weber]]'s [[tripartite classification of authority]] (one of several classifications of government used by sociologists); the other two forms being [[traditional authority]] and [[charismatic authority]]. All of those three domination types represent an example of his [[ideal type]] concept. Weber noted that in history those ideal types of domination are always found in combinations.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition. Charismatic authority is legitimized by the personality and leadership qualities of the ruling individual. Finally, rational-legal authority derives its powers from the system of [[bureaucracy]] and [[legality]].

==Legal rationality and legitimate authority ==
Under rational-legal authority, legitimacy is seen as coming from a legal order and the laws that have been enacted in it (see also [[natural law]] and [[legal positivism]]).

Weber defined legal order as a system where the rules are enacted and obeyed as legitimate because they are in line with other laws on how they can be enacted and how they should be obeyed. Further, they are enforced by a government that monopolizes their enactment and the [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|legitimate use of physical force]].

If society, as a whole, approves the exercise of the power in a certain way, then the power is considered "legitimate authority". 
* An example of this type of authority would be the viewing of a police car in our rear view mirrors.

== Max Weber's theory: type of authority ==
Max Weber broke down legitimate authority into three different types of societies: Traditional Authority, Rational-legal Authority, and Charismatic Authority. Each of these authorities have their own unique complex societies that have evolved from simple definitions.

=== 1.Traditional authority: traditional grounds ===

* Is the type of power that has been around longer, it is the type of power that is traditionally rooted in beliefs and the practices of society. This authority is liked by many individuals because of two main reasons: the inheritance of past generations and religiousness that the societies have.
* Traditional authority is based on a tradition or custom that is followed by the traditional leaders. In traditional authority, status is a key concept. There are no requirements to serving a traditional leader but there are no salaries. The consequences to traditional authority are discouragement of education and rational calculation.
* Traditional authority consists of a dominant profile, one who embodies tradition and rule. This type of leadership exemplifies the power to construct order.

=== 2. Rational-legal authority: rational grounds ===

* Acquire from law and is constructed from the reliance of society's rules and laws. This type of authority has the confidence to leave the right of leaders to undertake the decisions and set the policy. Rational-legal authority is the basis of modern democracies. Examples of this type of authority: officials elected by voters, rules that are in the constitution, or policies that are written in a formal document.
* Rational-legal authority is built on a structure of bureaucr
* Rational-legal authority requires a logical and systematic approach to leadership. Weber's rational leadership prevails in decision making.

=== 3. Charismatic authority: charismatic grounds ===

* Comes from individuals and their personal qualities that they have to offer. Certain individuals are influential to others with their unique qualities which help them gain followers. The "charismatic" individuals exercise power and authority over a whole society or even a specific group of within a bigger society. The exercise of their power of these individuals are either for good or bad. Examples of these charismatic leaders can range from: Joan of Arc to Adolf Hitler or Martin Luther king Jr to Jesus Christ.
* Charismatic authority has no clear structure. It is based one's individual influence.  One is chosen to be staff by their charismatic characteristics. Someone under a charismatic authority lives under gifts not salary. As long as someone has influence they will be a legitimate power.
* In charismatic authority, confidence is the driving force for leadership. With charismatic authority leadership has the ability to connect distinct groups and lead them to the finish line.

==Emergence of the modern state==
Weber wrote that the modern state based on rational-legal authority emerged from the patrimonial and feudal struggle for power (see [[traditional authority]]) uniquely in the [[Western culture|Occidental civilization]]. The prerequisites for the modern Western state are:
* Monopolization by central authority of the means of administration and control based on a centralized and stable system of taxation and use of physical force
* Monopolization of legislative
* Organisation of an officialdom, dependent upon the central authority

Weber argued that some of those attributes have existed in various time or places, but together they existed only in Occidental civilization. The conditions that favoured this were
* Emergence of rational-legal rationality (various [[status class|status groups]] in the [[Western world|Occident]] promoted that emergence)
* Emergence of modern officialdom (bureaucracy), which required
** Development of the money economy, where officials are compensated in money instead of kind (usually land grants)
** Quantitative and qualitative expansion of administrative tasks
** Centralization and increased efficiency of administration.

Weber's belief that rational-legal authority did not exist in [[History of China|Imperial China]] has been heavily criticized, and does not have many supporters in the early 21st century.

==Modern state==
According to Max Weber, a modern state exists where a political community has:
* An administrative and legal order that has been created and can be changed by legislation that also determines its role
* Binding authority over citizens and actions in its jurisdiction
* The right to legitimately use the physical force in its jurisdiction

An important attribute of Weber's definition of a modern state was that it is a [[bureaucracy]].

The vast majority of the modern states from the 20th century onward fall under the rational-legal authority category.

==Rational-legal leaders==
The majority of modern [[bureaucrat|bureaucratic officials]] and [[politician|political leaders]] represent this type of authority.

&lt;u&gt;Officials:&lt;/u&gt;
* Are personally free.
* Serve a higher authority.
* Are appointed on the basis of conduct and their technical qualifications.
* Are responsible for the impartial execution of assigned tasks.
* Their work is a full-time occupation.
* Their work is rewarded by a salary and prospects of career advancement.

&lt;u&gt;Politicians:&lt;/u&gt;
* Are solely responsible for independent action.
* Must recognize that public actions that conflict with their basic policy must be rejected.
* Should have [[charismatic authority|charismatic appeal]] to win [[election]]s under conditions of [[universal suffrage]].
&lt;u&gt;Additional, Weber provided ten necessities addressing: "how individual officials are appointed and work". The administrative staff are under the supreme authority for legal authority in a bureaucratic administrative style.&lt;/u&gt;

# They are personally free and subject to authority only with respect to their impersonal official obligation.
# They are organized in a clearly defined hierarchy of offices.
# Each office has a clearly defined sphere of competence in the legal sense.
# The office is filled by a free contractual relationship or free selection.
# Candidates are selected on the basis of technical qualification.
# They are remunerated by fixed salaries in money for the most part, with a right to pensions.
# The office is treated as the sole, or at least primary, occupation of incumbent.
# It constitutes a career. Promotions are dependent on the judgement of superiors.
# The official works entirely separated from ownership of the means of administration and without appropriation of his/her position.
# He is subject to strict and systematic discipline and control in the conduct of the office.

Rather than seeing [[aging]] as a loss of functionality as we get older, this theory defines aging as any change in an organism over time, as evidenced by the fact that if all chemical reactions in the body were stopped, no change, and thus no aging, would occur.  Since the most important change in an organism through time is the chemical reactions that result in a single cell developing into a multicellular organism, whatever controls these chemical reactions that regulate cell growth, development, and death, is believed to control aging. The theory argues that these cellular changes are directed by reproductive hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis ([[HPG axis]]).  Receptors for reproductive hormones (such as estrogens, progestogens, androgens and gonadotropins) have been found to be present in all tissues of the body.  Thus, HPG axis hormones normally promote growth and development of the organism early in life in order to achieve reproduction.  Hormones levels then begin to change in men around age 30 and more abruptly in women when they reach [[menopause]], around age 50.  When the HPG axis becomes unbalanced, cellular growth and development is dysregulated, and cell death and dysfunction can occur, both of which can initiate [[senescence]], the accumulated damage to cells, tissues, and organs that occurs with the passage of time and that is associated with functional loss during aging.

Evidence supporting this theory comes from disease studies showing that women who reach menopause later have less [[heart disease]] and [[stroke]], less [[dementia]], and less [[osteoporosis]], supporting the theory that the longer the HPG axis is in balance, the less likely one is to develop age-related diseases.  Conversely, early surgical menopause has been demonstrated to increase the incidence of these diseases.  However, the most compelling supportive evidence is from studies of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|Hormone Replacement Therapy]] (HRT).  Research with women and men undertaking HRT has shown that taking sex hormones that are biologically identical to human hormones delays the onset, decreases the incidence of, and can reverse the course of age related illnesses such as heart disease, [[Alzheimer's disease]], osteoporosis, and some types of [[cancer]].  However, only biological hormones appear to have these effects.  The use of non-human or synthetic hormones has been shown to increase the risk of certain of these diseases.  Compellingly, 18 studies have demonstrated an increase in longevity for those women taking HRT.

Further studies in support of the theory have shown that suppressing the HPG axis, such as when organisms experience either [[caloric restriction]], cold, or exercise stress, increases lifespan.  This is thought to be an evolutionary conserved mechanism that allows organisms to suppress HPG axis signaling and reproduction, thereby conserving reproductive resources ([[germ cells]]) for a later time when the environment is better suited to raising offspring.  By having the same hormones regulate both reproduction and aging, an animal is able to modulate its [[fertility]] and its rate of aging based on environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid20851172"&gt;{{cite  journal|author=Bowen RL, Atwood CS|title=The reproductive-cell cycle theory of aging: an update. |journal=Experimental Gerontology|volume=46|issue=2|pages=100–107|year=2011|pmid=20851172|doi=10.1016/j.exger.2010.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent parabiosis studies prove many of the tenets of the Reproductive Cell-Cycle Theory of Aging. In these experiments, where a young mouse is coupled surgically with an aged mouse, circulating factors from the young mouse rejuvenates the tissues of the old mice.  In particular, these studies indicate the importance of circulating factors in regulating the maintenance of neuronal (Villeda et al., 2011), vascular (Katsimpardi et al., 2014), muscular and liver (Conboy et al., 2005; Sinha et al., 2014) structure and function.

'''RoboMind''' is a simple educational programming environment with its own scripting language that allows beginners to learn the basics of [[computer science]] by programming a simulated [[robot]]. In addition to introducing common programming techniques, it also aims at offering insights in [[robotics]] and [[artificial intelligence]].
RoboMind is available as stand-alone application for [[Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]]. It was first released in 2005 and was originally developed by Arvid Halma, a student of the [[University of Amsterdam]] at that time. Since 2011 RoboMind is published by Research Kitchen.&lt;ref name="researchkitchen"&gt;[http://www.researchkitchen.net Research Kitchen], [[Delft]], [[The Netherlands]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The simulation environment==
The application is built around a two-dimensional grid world in which a robot can move around, observe neighboring cells, or mark them by leaving a paint trail. The world may also contain so-called beacons that can be carried around by the robot in order to clear its way.

Since version 4.0, it is possible to export RoboMind scripts to robots in the real world directly. Currently, [[Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0]] are supported.&lt;ref name="legoSupport"&gt;[http://www.robomind.net/en/docLego.html RoboMind's Lego Mindstorms NXT support]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The scripting language==
RoboMind offers a basic scripting language that consists of a concise set of rules. Apart from commands to make the robot perform basic movement instructions, the [[control flow]] can be modified by [[Branch (computer science)|conditional branching]] (if-then-else), loops (while) and calls to custom procedures.

Example script to draw square:
 paintWhite
 repeat(4) {
     forward(2)
     right
 }

Recursive line follower example:
 follow
 
 procedure follow{
     if(frontIsWhite){
               forward(1)		
     }
     else if(rightIsWhite){
               right
     }
     else if(leftIsWhite){
          left
     }
     else{
          end
     }
     follow
 }

The programming environment offers an integrated text editor to write these scripts, with [[syntax highlighting]], [[Autocomplete|autocompletion]] and [[line number]]ing.

Modifications to the environment, such as painting grid cells, are used to store a runtime state. This shows the robot in its environment is directly related to 2D [[Turing machine]]s.&lt;ref name="2dTuring"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHqe6LJuIc Robomind Turmite: 2D Turing Machine], a YouTube movie.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sortingTuring"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AppR-c7BObY Sorting Turing Machine in RoboMind], a YouTube movie.&lt;/ref&gt; Since version 5.0, the language does allow the declaration of variables and functions (procedures that return values).

The scripting language itself is currently available in 22 languages: [[Arabic]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovene language|Slovenian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]. All instructions and keywords can be translated. This makes it easier to learn for non-English speakers than most other programming languages that are constrained to English syntax and Latin alphabets.

==Relation to other educational software==
RoboMind is somewhat similar to [[Karel (programming language)|Karel the Robot]] but its syntax is closer to C/C++ while Karel is closer to [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].

RoboMind can be related to the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]], at which a turtle can be moved around to create geometric shapes. The syntax of RoboMind however is different and corresponds more directly to mainstream scripting languages, such as [[JavaScript]]. In RoboMind perceiving and changing the environment are of equal importance, where Logo focuses mostly on the latter. This makes RoboMind more suitable to demonstrate real life applications. In Logo, on the other hand, users have more freedom to create visual effects.

Other free educational programming languages, such as [[Alice (software)|Alice]] and [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] focus on the wider domain of interactive story telling.

'''Sholem Aleichem Amur State University''' ({{lang-ru|Приамурский государственный университет имени Шолом-Алейхема}}), formerly '''Birobidzhan State Pedagogical Institute''', is a [[university]] in [[Russia]]. This is the only university based in the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]. It is named after Jewish-Russian author [[Sholem Aleichem]].

==Overview==
The university works in cooperation with the local Jewish community of [[Birobidzhan]] and the [[Birobidzhan Synagogue]]. It is unique in the [[Russian Far East]]. The basis of the training courses is study of the [[Hebrew language]], history and classic [[Jewish]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Информационно-аналитическое управление правительства ЕАО |url=http://www.eao.ru/eng/?p=365 |title=Еврейская автономная область - официальный портал |publisher=Eao.ru |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] has grown interest in its [[Jewish]] roots. Students study Hebrew and [[Yiddish]] at the Jewish school and Birobidzhan Jewish National University. In 1989, the Jewish Center founded a [[Sunday school]], where children can study Yiddish, learn [[Jewish]] [[folk dance|folk]]  [[dance]], and  [[history of Israel]]. The [[Israeli government]] helps fund this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vn.vladnews.ru/Arch/2000/ISS207/focus.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204084032/http://vn.vladnews.ru/Arch/2000/ISS207/focus.html |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the first Birobidzhan International Summer Program for Yiddish Language and Culture was launched by Boris Kotlerman, a Yiddish studies professor at [[Bar-Ilan University]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2all.co.il/web/Sites/yiddishproject/ |title=Yiddish Summer School in Birobidzhan, Home |publisher=2all.co.il |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yiddish is still the region’s second [[official language]] after [[Russian language|Russian]], although it is spoken only by a handful of 4,000 remaining Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liphshiz |first=Cnaan |url=http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/account/new/index |title=Index for a million documents on Polish Jewry to go online &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/news/article/20070814Yiddishprogram.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070621171021/http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/news/article/20070814Yiddishprogram.html |archivedate=2007-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This program includes a workshop on the village of [[Valdgeym]] and its Yiddish [[Cultural heritage|heritage]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"/&gt;

A '''space sunshade''' or '''sunshield''' is a [[Umbrella|parasol]] that [[wikt:divert|divert]]s or otherwise reduces some of a star's radiation, preventing them from hitting a spacecraft or planet and thereby reducing its [[insolation]], which results in reduced heating.  Light can be diverted by different methods.  First proposed in 1989, the original space sunshade concept involves putting a large occulting disc, or technology of equivalent purpose at the L1 gravitation point ([[Lagrangian point]]) between the Earth and Sun.  

A sunshade is of particular interest as a [[climate engineering]] method for [[Climate change mitigation|mitigating]] [[global warming]] through [[solar radiation management]].  Heightened interest in such projects reflects the concern that internationally negotiated reductions in carbon emissions may be insufficient to stem climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, John. "The Political Economy of a Planetary Sunshade" Astropolitics: The International Journal of Space Politics and Policy (2018): 16(1):1-10.  Retrieved 3-30-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sunshades could also be used to produce [[space solar power]], acting as [[solar power satellites]]. Proposed shade designs include a single-piece shade and a shade made by a great number of small objects. Most such proposals contemplate a blocking element at the Sun-Earth L1 [[Lagrangian point]].

In 1989 James Early proposed a space-based sun-shade to divert sunlight at the planetary level.  His design involved making a large glass (2000 km) occulter from lunar material and placing at the L1 point.  Issues included the large amount of material needed to make the disc and also the energy to launch it to its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160425-how-a-giant-space-umbrella-could-stop-global-warming|title=How a giant space umbrella could stop global warming|last=Gorvett|first=Zaria|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designs for planetary sunshade==

=== Cloud of small spacecraft ===
One proposed sunshade would be composed of 16&amp;nbsp;trillion small disks at the Sun-Earth L1 [[Lagrangian point]], 1.5 million kilometers above Earth. Each disk is proposed to have a 0.6-meter diameter and a thickness of about 5&amp;nbsp;micrometers. The mass of each disk would be about a gram, adding up to a total of almost 20&amp;nbsp;million tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | format =
  | doi =
  | accessdate =2010-11-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a group of small sunshades that blocks 2% of the sunlight, deflecting it off into space, would be enough to halt global warming, giving us ample time to cut our emissions back on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title =Global Sunshade

  | format =
  | doi =
  | accessdate =2010-11-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual autonomous flyers building up the cloud of sunshades are proposed not to reflect the sunlight but rather to be transparent lenses, deflecting the light slightly so it does not hit Earth.  This minimizes the effect of [[solar radiation pressure]] on the units, requiring less effort to hold them in place at the L1 point.  An optical prototype has been constructed by [[Roger Angel]] with funding from [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|NIAC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | format =
  | doi =
  | accessdate =2010-11-14  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining solar pressure and the fact that the L1 point is one of [[unstable equilibrium]], easily disturbed by the wobble of the earth due to gravitational effects from the moon, requires the small autonomous flyers to be capable of maneuvering themselves to hold position.  A suggested solution is to place mirrors capable of rotation on the surface of the flyers.  By using the solar radiation pressure on the mirrors as [[solar sail]]s and tilting them in the right direction, the flyer will be capable of altering its speed and direction to keep in position.&lt;ref name = "L1_cooling"&gt;{{cite web

Such a group of sunshades would need to occupy an area of about 3.8 million square kilometers if placed at the L1 point.&lt;ref name = "L1_cooling" /&gt; The deployment of the flyers is an issue that requires new technology.  Large [[railgun]]s or [[coilgun]]s are proposed to fire a capsule containing a million shades into space every 5 minutes for 10 years using 20 separate launch sites.

Even so, it would still take years to launch enough of the disks into [[orbit]] to have any effect.  This means a long [[lead time]].  Roger Angel of the University of Arizona&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Stiles| first=Lori| title=Space sunshade might be feasible in global warming emergency| url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-11/uoa-ssm110306.php| work="Feasibility of cooling the Earth with a cloud of small spacecraft near L1,"| publisher=Eurekalert| accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  presented the idea for a sunshade at the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] in April 2006 and won a [[NASA]] Institute for Advanced Concepts grant for further research in July 2006.

Creating this sunshade in space was estimated to cost in excess of US$5&amp;nbsp;trillion with an estimated lifetime of 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate =2010-11-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus leading Professor Angel to conclude that "[t]he sunshade is no substitute for developing [[renewable energy]], the only permanent solution. A similar massive level of technological innovation and financial investment could ensure that. But if the planet gets into an abrupt climate crisis that can only be fixed by cooling, it would be good to be ready with some shading solutions that have been worked out."&lt;ref name="L1_cooling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Earth Observatory 2006-11-03"&gt;{{cite press release

===One Fresnel lens===
[[Image:Space lens.png|thumb|right|300px|The basic function of a space lens to mitigate global warming. A 1,000-kilometre diameter lens is sufficient, and much smaller than what is shown in this simplified image. As a [[Fresnel lens]] it would be only a few millimeters thick.]]

Several authors have proposed dispersing light before it reaches the Earth by putting a very large lens in space, perhaps at the [[Lagrangian point#L1|L1]] point between the Earth and the Sun. This plan was proposed in 1989 by J.&amp;nbsp;T. Early.&lt;ref name="Early"&gt;{{Citation
|author=J. T. Early
|title=Space-Based Solar Shield To Offset Greenhouse Effect
|year=1989
|periodical=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society
|volume=42
|pages=567–569|bibcode = 1989JBIS...42..567E }}. This proposal is also discussed in footnote 23 of {{Citation
|author1=Edward Teller |author2=Roderick Hyde |author3=Lowell Wood  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Global Warming and Ice Ages: Prospects for Physics-Based Modulation of Global Change
|year=1997

|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
|url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/231636.pdf
|accessdate=2010-10-30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, physicist and science fiction author [[Gregory Benford]] calculated that a [[concave lens|concave]] rotating [[Fresnel lens]] 1000 kilometres across, yet only a few millimeters thick, floating in space at the {{L1}} point, would reduce the solar energy reaching the Earth by approximately 0.5% to 1%.&lt;ref name="Benford1"&gt;See [http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/4/7/41932/19363 Russell Dovey, "Supervillainy: Astroengineering Global Warming] and [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=370 Bill Christensen, "Reduce Global Warming by Blocking Sunlight"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417153949/http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=370 |date=2009-04-17 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of such a lens has been disputed. At a science fiction convention in 2004, Benford estimated that it would cost about [[United States dollar|US$]]10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] up front, and another $10&amp;nbsp;billion in supportive cost during its lifespan.&lt;ref name="Benford1"/&gt;

===One diffraction grating===
A similar approach involves placing a very large [[diffraction grating]] (thin wire mesh) in space, perhaps at the [[Lagrangian point#L1|L1]] point between the Earth and the Sun. A proposal for a 3,000 ton diffraction mesh was made in 1997 by [[Edward Teller]], [[Lowell Wood]], and [[Roderick Hyde]],&lt;ref name="Teller1997"&gt;{{Citation

|accessdate=2010-10-30}}. See pages 10–14 in particular.&lt;/ref&gt; although in 2002 these same authors argued for blocking solar radiation in the stratosphere rather than in orbit given then-current space launch technologies.&lt;ref name="Teller2002"&gt;{{Citation

==Spacecraft sunshades==
The [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST) infrared telescope has a layered sunshade to keep the telescope cold.

For spacecraft approaching the sun the sunshade is usually called a heatshield. Notable spacecraft [designs] with heatshields include :
* [[Parker Solar Probe]] (was Solar Probe Plus), launched 2018 (carbon, carbon-foam, carbon sandwich heatshield)
* [[Solar Orbiter]], may launch 2020
* [[Messenger (spacecraft)|Messenger]], orbits Mercury, has a ceramic cloth sunshade
* [[BepiColumbo]], to orbit Mercury, with Optical Solar Reflectors (acting as a sunshade) on the Planetary Orbiter component.

'''Substitutes for leadership theory''' is a [[leadership]] theory first developed by Steven Kerr and John M. Jermier in 1978. The theory states that different situational factors can enhance, neutralize, or substitute for leader behaviors (Avolio, Walumbwa, &amp; Weber, 2009; Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001). It has received criticism for shortcomings due to perceived methodological issues (Dionne, Yammarino, Atwater, &amp; James, 2002; Podsakoff &amp; Mackenzie, 1995). Empirical research has produced mixed results as to its ability to predict subordinate outcomes.

==Origins==
Over the years, researchers have developed many [[leadership theory|leadership theories]].  Prior to the 1970s, [[trait leadership]] theory and [[path-goal theory]] were the two heavily researched theories. (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).  Proponents of trait leadership theory held that the ability to lead is a characteristic some people innately have and others do not.  Effort was put forth to uncover which characteristics and abilities leaders had that separated them from non-leaders.
Leadership style was another angle researchers took.  Proponents of this approach did not believe the ability to lead was innate, rather it was a set of behaviors anyone could learn (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).

In the mid 1970s, a great deal of research was dedicated to the contingency model and path-goal theory (Schriesheim, 1997).  The contingency model stated that various leadership styles would be more or less effective depending on the situation (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001; Fiedler, 1965; Hunt, 1967).  Path-goal theory proposed that subordinates would be satisfied with their leader if they perceived that their leader’s behavior would bring them future satisfaction.  Subordinates would be motivated by their leader if they perceived that completing work tasks would bring them satisfaction, and if the leader provided proper coaching, support, rewards, and guidance (House, 1996).  Frustrations with not being able to find significant results with any one theory resulted in the development of reexaminations and new approaches, including questioning which situations necessitated a leader figure and which did not (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).

Steven Kerr was one of the researchers publicly expressing his frustrations (e.g., Kerr &amp; Harlan, 1973) with current leadership theories.  In the 1970s, Kerr was at Ohio State University actively involved in leadership research.  Kerr was studying existing proposed subordinate constructs such as organizational independence (Schriesheim, 1997) and proposed leadership constructs such as consideration and initiating structure (put forth by the Ohio State Leadership Studies; Kerr, Schriesheim, Murphy, &amp; Stogdill, 1974).

Subordinates that are organizational independents do not feel tied to one company and are internally motivated instead of motivated by the characteristics of the organization, such as leader behavior (House &amp; Kerr, 1973; Schriesheim, 1997).  Leaders high on initiating structure clarify their own role and their subordinates’ roles in obtaining a goal (Kerr et al., 1974). Kerr and colleagues (1974) noticed many studies had found significant [[Moderation (statistics)|moderators]] that played a part in the relationship between initiating structure leader behavior and subordinate outcomes.  For example, when a task was ambiguous, the relationship between leader initiating structure and subordinate satisfaction was stronger than if the task was clear. These findings made it apparent that there were variables that affected the relationship between leader behavior and subordinate outcomes, making the relationship stronger or weaker.

Kerr (1973) was the first to coin substitutes for leadership as elements in the work setting that lessened leader effectiveness on subordinate outcomes.  Further publications (e.g., Kerr et al., 1974) led to Kerr and Jermier’s 1978 paper, which unveiled substitutes for leadership theory.  This paper presented two types of elements in the job environment: substitutes and neutralizers.  These elements were proposed to serve as moderators in the relationship between leader behavior and subordinate outcomes.

The theory originally classified substitutes as characteristics of the subordinate, characteristics of the task, and characteristics of the organization.  Howell, Dorfman, &amp; Kerr (1986) proposed an alteration to the theory in terms of subordinate classification.  They argued that moderators should be grouped based on their effect on the criterion.  The original theory had already proposed moderators that act as substitutes and moderators that act as neutralizers.  Howell and colleagues added enhancers to these.

Substitutes for leadership theory was a heavily researched area until the late 1980s, when [[transformational leadership]] became the focus of the majority of leadership research (Dionne, Yammarino, Howell, &amp; Villa, 2005).

==Definitions==

===Substitutes for leadership theory===

Substitutes for leadership theory states that different situational factors can enhance, neutralize, or substitute for leader behaviors (Avolio et al., 2009; Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).

===Substitutes===
Substitutes are variables that make leadership unnecessary for subordinates (Schriesheim, 1997) and reduce the extent to which subordinates rely on their leader (Kerr et al.,1974)

====Examples of substitutes====
* Characteristics of the subordinate
** Subordinate ability (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
** Subordinate’s professional orientation (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
* Characteristics of the task
** Unambiguous and routine task (when all subordinates are performing menial labor, there is little role leadership can play; Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001)
** Task that provides its own feedback as to how well the task is being done (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
** Task that is intrinsically satisfying (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
* Characteristics of the organization
** Cohesive work groups (a tight-knit group of employees have less need for a leader; Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001)
** Organizational formulation (clear job goals that are written down, performance appraisals that are written down; Howell &amp; Dorfman, 1981; Kerr and Jermier, 1987)
** Self-managed work teams (employees rely on each other, not their leader; Villa, Howell, Dorfman, &amp; Daniel, 2003)

===Enhancers===
Enhancers are variables that serve to strengthen leader influence on subordinate outcomes (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001; Howell et al., 1986; Schriesheim, 1997).

====Examples of enhancers====
* Characteristics of the subordinate
** Subordinates having experience (those more experienced will be able to translate even the most ambiguous instructions into results; Howell et al., 1986)
* Characteristics of the task
** Task is non-routine (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
* Characteristics of the organization
** Having group norms that encourage cooperation with leaders (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001)
** Leader having the ability to reward subordinates (Howell et al., 1986)

===Neutralizers===
Neutralizers are variables which serve to weaken, or block leader influence on subordinate outcomes (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001; Schriesheim, 1997).

====Examples of neutralizers====
* Characteristics of the subordinate
** Subordinates are indifferent when it comes to rewards (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
* Characteristics of the organization
** Whether or not subordinates are rewarded is not the leader’s decision (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
* Kerr &amp; Jermier (1978) never specified an example of a task characteristic that acts as a neutralizer.

==Scales used to measure==

===Kerr and Jermier===
The original scale to measure the effects of various substitutes was developed by Kerr and Jermier (1978).  They assessed leadership substitutes via a questionnaire that contained thirteen subscales with a total of 55 items.  The items were on a [[Likert scale]] ranging from 1 (almost always untrue or completely untrue), to 5 (almost always true or almost completely true).

The subscales included were:
# Ability, experience, training, and knowledge
# Professional orientation
# Indifference towards organizational rewards
# Unambiguous, routine, and methodically invariant tasks
# Task-provided feedback concerning accomplishment
# Intrinsically satisfying tasks
# Organizational formulization
# Organizational inflexibility
# Advisory and staff functions
# Close-knit, cohesive, interdependent work groups
# Organizational rewards not within the leader’s control
# Spatial distance between superior and subordinates
# Subordinate need for independence

Kerr and Jermier (1978) tested nine of these subscales in a lab setting and found that they were independent and had adequate internal [[reliability (statistics)|reliabilities]]. They claim that the subscales produce easily interpretable data which describe the extent to which substitutes for leadership are present or absent in a given work situation.
They went on to test their subscales in a field setting using police officers, and concluded that the subscales met acceptable standards of reliability, and can be used to assess the [[validity (statistics)|validity]] of the substitutes for leadership construct in future studies.

===Podsakoff, Niehoff, MacKenzie, and Williams===
Podsakoff, Niehoff, MacKenzie, and Williams (1993) noted that studies testing the substitutes for leadership model had not been fully supportive of the theory, and believed that one reason for this may be that the quality of the scale developed by Kerr and Jermier (1978) to measure the substitutes constructs may be to blame. In response to this, they designed their own 74-item measure of substitutes for leadership.
To test their scale, they administered it to 372 business students.  Their analyses of the [[psychometrics|psychometric]] properties of the revised measure revealed their scale to be superior to Kerr and Jermier’s scale, as evidenced by better dimensionality and reliability of the revised scale.

==Consequences==

Kerr and Jermier (1978) proposed that substitute variables should render leader behaviors unable to predict subordinate outcomes.  Researchers that have tested this characteristic of substitutes have found mixed results (Howell &amp; Dorfman, 1981; Podsakoff &amp; MacKenzie, 1995).

A study involving hospital personnel (Howell &amp; Dorfman, 1981) found that tasks that gave feedback regarding performance were negatively correlated with [[job satisfaction]].  Routine repetitive work tasks were correlated with [[organizational commitment]].  Intrinsically satisfying work, organizational formulation, and cohesive work groups were substitutes that were significantly correlated with both job satisfaction and organizational commitment.  However, they found little evidence that substitutes prevented or replaced a leader’s effect on subordinate job satisfaction or organizational commitment.  The only substitute that served as a replacement was organizational formulation, which replaced leader behavior’s predictive power in explaining subordinate job satisfaction and organizational commitment .

Another study (Podsakoff &amp; Mackenzie, 1995) looked at 1,235 employees working for 265 leaders in a variety of job settings.  Among their findings were that intrinsically satisfying tasks were positively related to subordinate satisfaction, indifference to rewards was negatively related to organizational commitment, and organizational formulation was negatively related to subordinate perceptions of role ambiguity.  The researchers in this study concluded that substitutes for leadership were useful in predicting subordinate outcomes, but leader behaviors and substitutes should always be studied together, because together they explained about a third of the total [[variance]] in subordinate outcomes in their sample .
A more recent study conducted by Dionne and colleagues (2002) collected data from 940 subordinates.  Unsatisfied with the fact that prior studies had tested substitutes, enhancers, and neutralizers as moderators, they tested the effect of substitutes as [[Mediation (statistics)|mediators]] as well as moderators.  Testing a variety of different substitutes and outcomes, the researchers found only very weak evidence that substitutes make a difference, and concluded that leader behaviors are the only important variable in predicting employee outcomes.
Podsakoff, MacKenzie, and Bommer (1996) conducted a [[meta-analysis]] in which they took the results of 22 studies that examined the main effect of substitutes for leadership on the relationship between leader behaviors and subordinate outcomes.  They found evidence supporting the theory— taking into account both leader behaviors and the effect of substitutes accounted for more of the variance in subordinate outcomes than taking into account leader behaviors alone.

==Applications==

===Autonomous work groups===
Bass (1990) suggested that [[autonomous work group]]s can substitute for formal leadership.  In this scenario, employees are divided into groups that are responsible for managing their own day-to-day work (i.e. collective control over pace, distribution of tasks, organization of breaks, recruitment, and training; Gulowsen, 1972).  A [[quasi-experiment]] conducted by Wall, Kemp, Jackson, and Clegg (1986) found that implementing autonomous work groups of 8 to 12 shop-floor employees in a manufacturing setting positively affected both the intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction of employees, while obviating some supervisory positions.

===Self-management===
Self-management is defined by Thoresen and Mahoney (1974) as occurring when an individual behaves in a way he would not normally behave, and there are no external forces dictating that the person maintain that behavior.
Self-management requires self-observations (e.g., keeping a log of what one has discussed with others on the phone), specification of goals (e.g., being responsible for setting one’s own schedule and priorities), cueing strategies (e.g., putting a checkout board by the exit to remind an employee to let their secretary know where they are going and when they expect to return), rehearsal (e.g., recording one’s presentation to clients and making corrections as needed), self-evaluation (e.g., using a chart to keep track of work quality and quantity), and self-reinforcement (accomplished by building intrinsic rewards for the performance of tasks; Bass, 1990; Manz &amp; Sims 1980).  These strategies can be understood as being substitutes for leadership.  Instead of requiring that a supervisor monitor a subordinate’s progress on a work task, a subordinate can self-manage by utilizing one of the strategies listed above.  This makes the supervisor’s guidance unnecessary for the subordinate.

==Criticisms and methodological problems with research==

===Common-source bias===
Dionne and colleagues (2002) argued that significant effects of substitutes found in prior studies may be a statistical artifact due to ''common-source bias'', or bias occurring when independent and dependent variables are collected from the same person or group of people.  In a study sampling 49 organizations, Dionne and colleagues controlled for the effect of common-source bias and found no moderating or mediating effects of substitutes on the relationship between leader behavior and group effectiveness.

In a study by Podsakoff and Mackenzie (1995), the predictor variables, as well as the job attitude and role perception variables, were both taken from individual employees, while the performance measures were taken from supervisors. They found that their predictors accounted for a higher proportion of variance in job attitudes and role perceptions, than in employee performance. They posit the reason for this was that their predictors shared a common source with the job attitudes and role perception criterion measures, but not with the employee performance criterion measures. They suggested that common-source bias may not be the only reason for this, but that it should be controlled in future research.

===Lack of longitudinal studies===
Keller (2006) conducted a [[longitudinal study]] in which he pointed out that the vast majority of studies conducted on substitutes for leadership theory are [[cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]] in nature, making it more difficult to discern a causal relationship between substitutes and their effects on employee performance.  Cross-sectional research is focused on finding relationships between variables at a specific point in time, whereas longitudinal studies involve taking multiple measures over a longer period of time.  Keller’s longitudinal study of the effect of substitutes on Research &amp; Development teams found that two of the seven substitutes (ability and intrinsic satisfaction) affected team performance over time.

===Conceptual weakness===
Yukl (1998) pointed out that it is hard to identify specific substitutes and neutralizers for broad behavior categories, and that an improvement on the theory would be to use more specific behaviors in place of "supportive and instrumental leadership behaviors." Yukl said that recent studies testing the theory have used specific behaviors (e.g., contingent reward behavior and role clarification), however the development of the theory does not reflect these developments.

==Closely related constructs==

===Contingency model===
The [[Fiedler contingency model|contingency model]] of leadership was developed by Fred Fiedler in the 1960s after Fiedler spent 12 years collecting data from over 800 groups of employees.  This model predicts that the most effective method of leadership will vary depending on the situation.  A study which supported the model was one Fiedler did with 48 petty officers and 240 recruiters at a Belgium naval training center (Fiedler, 1965).  Fiedler found that a leader’s fit with the group and the task was more important in predicting outcomes than the leader’s characteristics.  For example, controlling leaders went best with heterogeneous groups with low position power (Fiedler, 1965; Hunt 1967).
There are many different theories within the contingency paradigm, which differ on what situational factors change leadership effectiveness.  The most influential theory within this model is path-goal theory (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).

===Path-goal theory===
Proposed by Robert House in 1971, [[path-goal theory]] predicts that subordinates will be satisfied with their leader if they feel their leader’s behavior will lead them to satisfaction.  Also, subordinates will be motivated when they feel that their satisfaction depends on their performance and their leader acts in a way to help them reach goals (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001, House, 1971).  Path-goal theory predicts that when goals and the paths to those goals are clear, subordinates may not need leader guidance (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978).

Capmany and D. Novak, “Microwave photonics combines two worlds," ''Nature Photonics'' '''1''', 319-330 (2007). [http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v1/n6/abs/nphoton.2007.89.html]&lt;/ref&gt; since it uses an [[Optics|optical]] [[Front-end and back-end|frontend]]. It relies on the process of time-stretch, which effectively slows down the [[analog signal]] in time (or compresses its bandwidth) before it can be digitized by a slow electronic ADC.

== Background ==
There is a huge demand for very high speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), as they are needed for [[Electronic test equipment|test and measurement equipment]] in laboratories and in high speed [[data]] [[communications system]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Most of the ADCs are based purely on electronic circuits, which have limited speeds and add a lot of impairments, limiting the bandwidth of the signals that can be digitized and the achievable [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. In the TS-ADC, this limitation is overcome by time-stretching the analog signal, which effectively slows down the signal in time prior to digitization. By doing so, the bandwidth (and [[carrier wave|carrier frequency]]) of the signal is compressed. Electronic ADCs that would have been too slow to digitize the original signal, can now be used to capture this slowed down signal.

== Operation principle==
[[File:Tsadc block diagram.png|thumb|right|400px|A time-stretch [[analog-to-digital converter]] (with a stretch factor of 4) is shown. The original analog signal is time-stretched and segmented with the help of a time-stretch [[preprocessor]] (generally on optical [[Front-end and back-end|frontend]]). Slowed down segments are captured by conventional electronic ADCs. The digitized samples are rearranged to obtain the digital representation of the original signal.]]
[[File:Pts preprocessor mwp link.png|thumb|right|400px|[[Optics|Optical]] [[Front-end and back-end|frontend]] for a time-stretch analog-to-digital converter is shown. The original analog signal is [[modulation|modulated]] over a [[chirp]]ed optical pulse (obtained by [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersing]] an [[ultrashort pulse|ultra-short]] [[supercontinuum]] pulse from a mode-locked laser, MLL). Second dispersive medium stretches the optical pulse further. At the [[photodetector]] (PD) output, stretched replica of original signal is obtained.]]

The time-stretch processor, which is generally an [[Optics|optical]] [[Front-end and back-end|frontend]], stretches the signal in time. It also divides the signal into multiple segments using a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]], for example a [[wavelength division multiplex]]ing (WDM) [[Filter (optics)|filter]], to ensure that the stretched replica of the original analog signal segments do not overlap each other in time after stretching. The time-stretched and slowed down signal segments are then converted into [[Digital data|digital]] [[Sampling (signal processing)|samples]] by slow electronic ADCs. Finally, these samples are collected by a [[digital signal processor]] (DSP) and rearranged in a manner such that output data is the digital representation of the original analog signal. Any [[distortion]] added to the signal by the time-stretch [[preprocessor]] is also removed by the DSP.

An optical front-end is commonly used to accomplish this process of time-stretch. An [[Ultrashort pulse|ultrashort optical pulse]] (typically 100 to 200 [[femtoseconds]] long), also called a [[supercontinuum]] pulse, which has a broad optical bandwidth, is [[time stretch dispersive Fourier transform|time-stretched]] by [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersing]] it in a highly dispersive medium (such as a dispersion compensating fiber). This process results in (an almost) linear time-to-[[wavelength]] mapping in the stretched pulse, because different wavelengths travel at different speeds in the dispersive medium. The obtained pulse is called a [[chirp]]ed pulse as its [[frequency]] is changing with time, and it is typically a few nanoseconds long. The analog signal is [[Modulation|modulated]] onto this chirped pulse using an [[Electro-optic modulator|electro-optic intensity modulator]]. Subsequently, the modulated pulse is stretched further in the second dispersive medium which has much higher dispersion value. Finally, this obtained optical pulse is converted to electrical domain by a [[photodetector]], giving the stretched replica of the original analog signal.

For continuous operation, a train of [[supercontinuum]] pulses is used. The chirped pulses arriving at the electro-optic modulator should be wide enough (in time) such that the trailing edge of one pulse overlaps the leading edge of the next pulse. For segmentation, optical filters separate the signal into multiple wavelength [[Channel (communications)|channels]] at the output of the second dispersive medium. For each channel, a separate photodetector and [[Front-end and back-end|backend]] electronic ADC is used. Finally the output of these ADCs are passed on to the [[Digital Signal Processor|DSP]] which generates the desired digital output.

==Impulse response of the photonic time-stretch (PTS) system==
The PTS processor is based on specialized analog optical (or [[microwave]] photonic) [[optical fiber|fiber]] [[Data link|links]]&lt;ref name="CapmanyNP2007"/&gt; such as those used in [[cable television|cable TV]] distribution. While the dispersion of fiber is a nuisance in conventional analog [[optical link]]s, time-stretch technique exploits it to slow down the electrical [[waveform]] in the optical domain. In the cable TV link, the light source is a [[continuous-wave]] (CW) [[laser]]. In PTS, the source is a chirped pulse laser.

[[File:Tsadc 10Tsps.png|thumb|right|400px|Capture of a 95&amp;nbsp;GHz RF tone using the photonic time-stretch digitizer. The signal is captured at an effective sample rate of 10 terasamples per second.]]

In a conventional analog optical link, dispersion causes the upper and lower modulation [[sidebands]], ''f''&lt;sub&gt;optical&lt;/sub&gt; ± ''f''&lt;sub&gt;electrical&lt;/sub&gt;, to slip in relative [[Phase (waves)|phase]]. At certain frequencies, their beats with the optical [[Carrier wave|carrier]] [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] destructively, creating nulls in the [[frequency response]] of the system. For practical systems the first null is at tens of [[Gigahertz|GHz]], which is sufficient for handling most electrical signals of interest. Although it may seem that the dispersion penalty places a fundamental limit on the impulse response (or the bandwidth) of the time-stretch system, it can be eliminated. The dispersion penalty vanishes with [[single-sideband modulation]].&lt;ref name="CapmanyNP2007"/&gt; Alternatively, one can use the modulator’s secondary (inverse) output port to eliminate the dispersion penalty,&lt;ref name="CapmanyNP2007"/&gt; in much the same way as two [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] can eliminate [[Null (radio)|spatial nulls]] in [[wireless]] communication (hence the two antennas on top of a [[Wi-Fi|WiFi]] [[Wireless access point|access point]]). This configuration is termed phase-diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Yan Han, Ozdal Boyraz, Bahram Jalali, "Ultrawide-Band Photonic Time-Stretch A/D Converter Employing Phase Diversity," "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES" VOL. 53, NO. 4, APRIL 2005 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1420773]&lt;/ref&gt;   Combining the complementary outputs using a [[Maximal-ratio combining|maximal ratio combining]] (MRC) algorithm results in a transfer function with a flat response in the frequency domain.  Thus, the [[impulse response]] (bandwidth) of a time-stretch system is limited only by the bandwidth of the [[Electro-optics|electro-optic]] modulator, which is about 120&amp;nbsp;GHz—a value that is adequate for capturing most electrical waveforms of interest.

Extremely large stretch factors can be obtained using long lengths of fiber, but at the cost of larger loss—a problem that has been overcome by employing [[Raman amplification]] within the dispersive fiber itself, leading to the world’s fastest real-time digitizer.&lt;ref&gt;J. Chou, O. Boyraz, D. Solli, and B. Jalali, “Femtosecond real-time single-shot digitizer," ''Applied Physics Letters'' '''91''', 161105 (2007).

Gupta and B. Jalali, “Time-warp correction and calibration in photonic time-stretch analog-to-digital converter," ''Optics Letters'' '''33''', 2674–2676 (2008).

==Comparison with time lens imaging==
Another technique, temporal imaging using a time [[Lens (optics)|lens]], can also be used to slow down (mostly optical) signals in time. The time-lens concept relies on the mathematical equivalence between [[space|spatial]] [[diffraction]] and [[Time|temporal]] dispersion, the so-called space-time [[duality (mathematics)|duality]].&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Kolner and M. Nazarathy, “Temporal imaging with a time lens," ''Optics Letters'' '''14''', 630-632 (1989) [http://www.opticsinfobase.org/ol/abstract.cfm?URI=ol-14-12-630]&lt;/ref&gt; A lens held at fixed distance from an object produces a magnified visible [[image]]. The lens imparts a [[quadratic function|quadratic]] phase shift to the [[spatial frequency]] components of the optical waves; in conjunction with the [[free space]] [[Wave propagation|propagation]] (object to lens, lens to eye), this generates a magnified image. Owing to the mathematical equivalence between [[paraxial]] [[diffraction]] and temporal dispersion, an optical waveform can be temporally [[Optical imaging|imaged]] by a three-step process of dispersing it in time, subjecting it to a phase shift that is quadratic in time (the time lens itself), and dispersing it again. Theoretically, a [[Focus (optics)|focused]] [[Optical aberration|aberration]]-free image is obtained under a ''specific condition'' when the two dispersive elements and the phase shift satisfy the temporal equivalent of the classic lens equation. Alternatively, the time lens can be used without the second dispersive element to transfer the waveform’s temporal profile to the spectral domain, analogous to the property that an ordinary lens produces the spatial [[Fourier transform]] of an object at its [[focus (optics)|focal points]].&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Goodman, “Introduction to Fourier Optics," McGraw-Hill (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the time-lens approach, PTS is not based on the space-time duality – there is no lens equation that needs to be satisfied to obtain an error-free slowed-down version of the input waveform.  Time-stretch technique also offers continuous-time acquisition performance, a feature needed for mainstream applications of [[oscilloscopes]].

Another important difference between the two techniques is that the time lens requires the input signal to be subjected to high amount of dispersion before further processing. For electrical waveforms, the electronic devices that have the required characteristics: (1) high dispersion to loss ratio, (2) uniform dispersion, and (3) broad bandwidths, do not exist. This renders time lens not suitable for slowing down wideband electrical waveforms. In contrast, PTS does not have such a requirement. It was developed specifically for slowing down electrical waveforms and enable high speed digitizers.

== Relation to phase stretch transform ==
The [[phase stretch transform]] or PST is a computational approach to signal and image processing. One of its utilities is for feature detection and classification. phase stretch transform is a spin-off from research on the [[time stretch dispersive Fourier transform]]. It transforms the image by emulating propagation through a diffractive medium with engineered 3D dispersive property (refractive index).

==Application to imaging and spectroscopy==
In addition to wideband A/D conversion, photonic time-stretch (PTS) is also an enabling technology for high-throughput real-time instrumentation such as [[optical imaging|imaging]]&lt;ref&gt;K. Goda, K.K. Tsia, and B. Jalali, "Serial time-encoded amplified imaging for real-time observation of fast dynamic phenomena," Nature 458, 1145–1149, 2009. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v458/n7242/full/nature07980.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Solli, J. Chou, and B. Jalali, "Amplified wavelength–time transformation for real-time spectroscopy," ''Nature Photonics'' 2, 48-51, 2008. [http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v2/n1/full/nphoton.2007.253.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Chou, D. Solli, and B. Jalali, "Real-time spectroscopy with subgigahertz resolution using amplified dispersive Fourier transformation," ''Applied Physics Letters'' 92, 111102, 2008. [http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v92/i11/p111102_s1]&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Time stretch quantitative phase imaging|artificial intelligence facilitated high-speed phase microscopy]] is demonstrated to improve the diagnosis accuracy of cancer cells out of blood cells by simultaneous measurement of phase and intensity spatial profiles.&lt;ref&gt;C. Chen, A. Mahjoubfar, &amp; B. Jalali, “Deep Learning in Label-free Cell Classification," ''Scientific Reports'' 6, 21471 (2016) {{doi|10.1038/srep21471}}. [http://www.nature.com/articles/srep21471]&lt;/ref&gt; The world's fastest optical imaging method called [[serial time-encoded amplified microscopy (STEAM)]] makes use of the PTS technology to acquire image using a single-pixel photodetector and commercial ADC. 
Wavelength-time spectroscopy, which also relies on photonic time-stretch technique, permits real-time single-shot measurements of rapidly evolving or fluctuating spectra.

[[Time stretch quantitative phase imaging]] ([[Time stretch quantitative phase imaging|TS-QPI]]) is an imaging technique based on time-stretch technology for simultaneous measurement of phase and intensity spatial profiles.   In time stretched imaging, the object’s spatial information is encoded in the spectrum of laser pulses within a pulse duration of sub-nanoseconds. Each pulse representing one frame of the camera is then stretched in time so that it can be digitized in real-time by an electronic analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The ultra-fast pulse illumination freezes the motion of high-speed cells or particles in flow to achieve blur-free imaging.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder''''' is a 1998 book by [[Richard Dawkins]], in which the author discusses the relationship between science and [[the arts]] from the perspective of a scientist.

Dawkins addresses the misperception that science and art are at odds. Driven by the responses to his books ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' and ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' wherein readers resented his naturalistic world view, seeing it as depriving life of meaning, Dawkins felt the need to explain that, as a scientist, he saw the world as full of [[Wonder (emotion)|wonder]]s and a source of pleasure. This pleasure was not in spite of, but rather because he does not assume as cause the inexplicable actions of a [[deity]] but rather the understandable laws of nature.

His starting point is [[John Keats]]' well-known, light-hearted accusation that [[Isaac Newton]] destroyed the poetry of the [[rainbow]] by 'reducing it to the prismatic colours.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He then proposed a toast to 'Newton's health, and confusion to mathematics' to the amusement of all.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins's agenda is to show the reader that science does not destroy, but rather discovers poetry in the patterns of nature.

==Summary==
===Preface===
It is of little concern whether or not science can prove that the ultimate fate of the [[cosmos]] lacks [[meaning of life|purpose]]: we live our lives regardless at a "human" level, according to ambitions and [[perception]]s which come more naturally. Therefore, science should not be feared as a sort of cosmological wet blanket. In fact, those in search of beauty or poetry in their [[cosmology]] need not turn to the [[paranormal]] or even necessarily restrict themselves to the mysterious: science itself, the business of unravelling mysteries, is beautiful and poetic.  (The rest of the preface sketches an outline of the book, makes acknowledgements, etc.)

===The anaesthetic of familiarity===

====Opening lines====
"We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively outnumbers the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?"

====Summary====
The first chapter describes several ways in which the universe appears beautiful and poetic when viewed scientifically.  However, it first introduces an additional reason to embrace science.  [[space-time|Time and space]] are vast, so the [[probability]] that the reader came to be alive here and now, as opposed to another time or place, was slim. More important, the probability that the reader came to be alive at all were even slimmer: the correct structure of [[atom]]s had to align in the universe.
Given how special these circumstances are, the "noble" thing to do is employ the allotted several decades of human life towards understanding that universe. Rather than simply feeling connected with nature, one should rise above this "[[anaesthetic]] of familiarity" and ''observe'' the universe scientifically.

===Drawing room of dukes===
This chapter describes a third reason to embrace science (the first two being beauty and duty): improving one's performance in [[the arts]]. Science is often presented publicly in a translated format, "dumbed down" to fit the language and existing ideas of non-scientists. This offers a disservice to the public, who are capable of appreciating the beauty of the universe as deeply as a scientist can. The successful communication of unadulterated science enhances, not confuses, the arts; after all, poets (Dawkins' synonym for artists—see page 24) and scientists are motivated by a similar spirit of wonder. We should therefore battle the [[stereotype]] that science is difficult, uncool, and not useful for the common person.

===Barcodes in the stars===
Studying a phenomenon, such as a flower, cannot detract from its beauty.
First, some scientists, such as [[Feynman]], are able to appreciate the [[aesthetics]] of the flower while engaged in their study. Second, the mysteries which science unfolds lead to new and more exciting mysteries; for example, [[botany]]'s findings might lead us to wonder about the workings of a [[fly]]'s [[consciousness]].
This effect of multiplying mysteries should satisfy even those who think that scientific understanding is at odds with [[aesthetics]], e.g. people who agree with Einstein that "the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious".
(For evidence, the rest of this chapter discusses the fascinating science and beautiful new mysteries which followed in the wake of Newton's "unweaving" of the rainbow, q.e. his explanation of the [[prism (optics)|prism]]atic effects of moist air.)

===Barcodes on the air===
This chapter offers more evidence that science is fun and poetic, by exploring [[sound wave]]s, [[bird vocalization|birdsong]], and low-[[frequency]] phenomena such as [[pendula]] and periodic [[mass extinction]]s.

===Barcodes at the bar===
A fourth reason to embrace science is that it can help deliver justice in a court of law, via [[DNA fingerprinting]] or even via simple statistical reasoning.
Everyone should learn the scientist's art of probability assessment, to make better decisions.

===Hoodwink'd with faery fancy===
This chapter explores what Dawkins considers to be fallacies in [[astrology]], religion, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[Extraterrestrial hypothesis|extraterrestrial visitations]]. Credulity and [[David Hume|Hume]]'s criterion are also discussed.

===Unweaving the uncanny===
Amazing coincidences are much more common than we may think, and sometimes, when over-interpreted, they lead to faulty conclusions. [[Statistical significance test]]s can help determine which patterns are meaningful.

===Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance===
Unlike "magisterial poetry" (where metaphors and pretty language are used to describe the familiar), "pupillary poetry" uses poetic imagery to assist a scientist's thinking about the exotic (e.g. consider "being" an [[electron]] temporarily). Although it is useful, some authors take pupillary poetry too far, and, "[[drunk]] on metaphor", they produce "bad science"; i.e. postulate faulty theories. This is powered by humanity's natural tendency to look for representations.

===The selfish cooperator===
[[Gene]]s compete with each other, but this occurs within the context of collaboration, as is shown with examples involving [[mitochondria]], bacteria, and [[termite]]s. Two types of collaboration are co-adaptation (tailoring simultaneously the different parts of an organism, such as flower colour and flower markings), and co-evolution (two species changing together; e.g. [[predator]] and [[prey]] running speeds may increase together in a sort of [[arms race]]).

===The genetic Book of the Dead===
The body of any organism provides clues about its [[habitat]]. The genes allow one to reconstruct a picture of the range of ways of life that the species has experienced; in this sense DNA would act as a [[palimpsest]]ic "[[Digital data|digital]] [[archive]]" if only its language of encoding history could be fully understood. Finally, the curious genetics of [[cuckoo]]s is discussed.

===Reweaving the world===
The brain is akin to a powerful computer, which creates a sort of [[virtual reality]] to model economically the environment. [[Neural]] [[circuitry]] is discussed, and a comparison is made between brains and genes: albeit over different time scales, both record the environment's past to help the [[organism]] make the optimal actions in the (predicted) future.

===The balloon of the mind===
The simultaneous explosions in [[computer hardware|hardware]] and software of the 20th century are together an example of what Dawkins calls "self-feeding co-evolution".
A similar event occurred over a longer time scale (millions of years) when the minds and brains of our ancestors simultaneously improved very rapidly. Five possible triggers of this improvement were: language, map reading, [[ballistics]], [[meme]]s, and [[metaphor]]s/[[analogies]].

====Conclusion====
The final two paragraphs of ''The balloon of the mind'' conclude by saying that human beings are the only animal with a sense of purpose in life, and that that purpose should be to construct a comprehensive [[Scientific modelling|model]] of how the universe works.

The book coins an [[acronym]]ical term, ''Petwhac'' ''(Population of Events That Would Have Appeared Coincidental)''. This is defined as all those events that may be considered to be a 'coincidence' if studied casually, but are both possible and statistically probable.

A way to get an idea of how to use the petwhac is as follows. Say you see a friend from school you have not seen for years when you are on holiday (an unlikely event); before saying it is fate or coincidence, think what is in the petwhac (meeting any friend from the same time period at least, friends of your brothers, sisters or parents, old flames, neighbours, teachers, someone who worked in the local chip-shop... the list is probably endless, and all would seem coincidental). In short: the bigger the petwhac, the stronger case you have to avoid ascribing something to [[destiny|fate]] or coincidence.

Dawkins offers several examples of petwhacs in the book, two of which are the bedside clock of a woman ([[Richard Feynman]]'s wife) stopping exactly when she died, and a psychic who stops the watches of his television audience.

The first is explained by the fact that the clock had a mechanical defect which made it stop when tilted off the horizontal, which is what a nurse did to read the time of death in poor lighting conditions. The matter of the watches, in Dawkins' own words, is explained thus —

&lt;blockquote&gt;''If somebody's watch stopped three weeks after the spell was cast, even the most credulous would prefer to put it down to chance. We need to decide how large a delay would have been judged by the audience as sufficiently simultaneous with the psychic's announcement to impress. About five minutes is certainly safe, especially since he can keep talking to each caller for a few minutes before the next call ceases to seem roughly simultaneous. There are about 100,000 five-minute periods in a year. The probability that any given watch, say mine, will stop in a designated five-minute period is about 1 in 100,000. Low odds, but there are 10 million people watching the show. If only half of them are wearing watches, we could expect about 25 of those watches to stop in any given minute. If only a quarter of these ring into the studio, that is 6 calls, more than enough to dumbfound a naïve audience. Especially when you add in the calls from people whose watches stopped the day before, people whose watches didn't stop but whose grandfather clocks did, people who died of heart attacks and their bereaved relatives phoned in to say that their 'ticker' gave out, and so on.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dawkins defends his choice of the word "population" by writing "Population may seem an odd word, but it is the correct statistical term.", adding "I won't keep using capital letters because they stand so unattractively on the page."

The '''''École européenne de chimie, polymères et matériaux''''' ('''ECPM'''; European School of Chemistry, Polymers and Materials Science) of Strasbourg is a public engineering school in the city of [[Strasbourg, France|Strasbourg]], in [[Alsace, France|Alsace]], [[France]]. It was founded in 1948, and is located on the Cronenbourg Campus of the [[University of Strasbourg]].  Each year 90 students graduate from the school with a [[diplôme d'ingénieur]]. It is a National School of Engineers, part of the University of Strasbourg and a member of the [[:fr:Fédération Gay-Lussac|Fédération Gay-Lussac]], which recruits from the common polytechnic entrance examination. It is also part of the Alsace Tech network of nine engineering schools in Alsace. The ECPM offers its students three specialties: [[chemistry]] ([[analytical chemistry|analytical]] or [[organic chemistry|organic]]), [[polymer science|polymers]] or [[material science|materials]].

== History ==

''1919'' -
Creation of the chemical institute by the professors T.Muller and H.Gault. Lectures are taught rue Goethe in Strasbourg.

''1948'' -
Creation at the same place of the Ecole nationale supérieure de chimie (ENSCS) by the professor H. Forestier.

''1962'' -
The Ecole de chimie has place in new premises (tour de la Chimie) on the [[:fr:campus central de l'Esplanade|campus central de l'Esplanade]]. The first practical sessions from the ENSCS in analytical chemistry begin at the start of the school year 1962.

''1968'' -
The ENSCS becomes a public organization.

''1981'' -
The professor M. Daire introduces the European teaching program.

''1986'' -
The ENSCS becomes Ecole Européenne des hautes études des industries chimiques de Strasbourg (EHICS)

''1995'' -
The EHICS, the Ecole d'application des hauts Polymères and the Magistère matériaux de l'université de Strasbourg-I group together and form the Ecole de chimie, Polymères et Matériaux (ECPM).

''1998-1999'' -
The ECPM moves to new premises on the University's Cronenbourg campus.

''2006'' -
Strasbourg becomes [[business cluster]] of the French chemistry.

''2009'' -
The [[:fr:Université Louis Pasteur|université Louis Pasteur]] and the other universities of Strasbourg are joined and form l'[[:fr:Université de Strasbourg|Université de Strasbourg]]

''2011'' -
Opening of the new Classe préparatoire intégrée internationale (CP2I) - CHEM.I.ST. at the start of the school year 2011.

== Admission to ECPM ==

→ To enter the First year:

- The school recruit essentially with the «Concours Communs Polytechniques» (CCP) or the DEUG (which are national competitive exams).

- The admission could also be done by an interview with a License 3 in Chemistry or in Physics at the university, a DUT (university diploma of technology) for example, in Chemistry,  physical measurements optional materials or chemical engineering.

- For international students, they must have a Bachelor of science or an equivalent foreign degree.

- After 2 years in CPI classes at Rennes (ENSCR), Lille(ENSCL), Clermont-Ferrand (ENSCCF) or in Strasbourg (ECPM: referred to the CPI classe's paragraph).

→ To enter the Second year, students can have access at the ECPM having an interview, with a Master M1 in Physics with a speciality in Polymers or materials.

→ Admission to the CP2i class in the ECPM, after the Baccalaureate, or an equivalent foreign degree for the international students.

There is no competitive exam, but every student should submit their school results. Then there are interviews to evaluate the motivations with the people in charge of the Chem.I.St programme. Approximately 50 students are selected every year. There are nearly 20% international students.

== CP2I / Classe préparatoire intégrée internationale ==

This class allows the students to gain admission to a school of the Fédération Gay Lussac (19 schools) after two years. These 2 years consist of studying engineer's trades in the domain of chemistry.

There are 5 CPIs in France: Rennes, Clermont-Ferrand, Lille, Pau and Strasbourg at the ECPM

The last one was opened at the start of the 2011-12 school year in Strasbourg. The speciality of this school is that it welcomes a large number of international students, as well as that 20% of the courses are delivered in English and 10% are delivered in German (optional). There are 50 students in each year.

To gain admission to the CP2I:

* French students register on Admission Post-Bac and follow the steps.

Students are selected on the basis of their academic record and a 20-minute interview.

* International students submit their dossiers directly to the school.

International students are also selected on the basis of their academic record and an interview.

General presentation of CPI-CHEM.I.ST :

* A strong scientific program: a major part of chemistry, physics and maths during the 2 years with a total, for the first year, of around 700 hours of scientific lesson. We must add Lab Work of this scientific formation, with a total of 102 hours for the first year. 
The CPI-CHEM.I.ST base of more practical work than in an intensive foundation degree, with high-quality laboratory. The program includes group work to develop the communication, the creativity around scientists projects. Moreover, in 2016, a "videxo" program was created. During, the "videxo" student solves a science problem on a board and in the same time someone films him to send the video to the teachers. The goal of this is to promote self-confidence, speaking, and the scientist reflexion which are important qualities for the future engineer.

* An international program in a multicultural environment: many students with different cultures and two foreign languages to learn. At the beginning of the formation, students can participate in an English language session for one week in order to learn the fundamentals of the scientific English. Insertions travels are organised at the end of the first year in Germany or in England. The students will participate in lectures and lab work in a foreign university. Most of the time the foreign students come from China.

==Speciality==
The speciality is chosen in the second year. Students have four possibilities:

'''Chemistry''':

Organic Chemistry: With this speciality, students attain a high level in synthesis and characterization of organic chemistry.

Analytical Chemistry:  Students are trained in techniques of analysis within the context of quality control.

'''Polymers''':  Students are trained to become flexible engineers in the polymer industry.

'''Materials''':  Students are trained in physics and chemistry of functional materials. Students become engineers specializing in conception and development of materials with an added value.

==Community life==

There are several associations managed by school's students :

- '''l'Amicale''' (BDE) (or ''Student Union'' ): It manages the associative and festive life of the school, organizes students foyer's functioning, publishes students' directory and organizes events like, for example, new students integration's weekend. About ten clubs exist in the association like the Arts' Office, DéméTerre (sustainable development), Theatre Club, Manga Club, Cine Club, Gastronomy Club, study trip, etc.

- Le '''Bureau des Sports''' (BDS° (or  '''Sports Office''') : It allows students to do sport, to participate in university competitions and organizes events like a nice trip at the month for a weekend or at the [[:fr:Tournoi Inter-Chimie|Tournoi Inter-Chimie]] (TIC) in spring. Moreover, the ECPM won this sports and festive event in 2006 which has been organized in Mulhouse.

- Le "'''Forum Horizon Chimie"''' (FHC) : It's the ECPM's association that organize a forum which happens every year at la [[:fr:Maison de la Chimie|Maison de la Chimie]] in Paris.

Moreover, a junior company, Strasbourg Chimie Service, allows students-employed to make some punctual missions like chemical analyses, scientific conferences or translations of publications.

It also exists '''l'Amicale des Ingénieurs de Chimie de Strasbourg''' (Association of the Strasbourg's Engineers of Chemistry). It's an association aiming at conservation and relations' strengthening between graduates and students. It has in particular for ultimate objective the creation of a robust and big network ECPM, a very great tool for a successful career.

-'''Student common room'''

The ECPM Student common room is the center of the school. It is a place where students can relax after lunch or during off-peak times. 
It is a big place where you can find a table football, a billiard table, many couches and tables and even a microwave. In fact, it is possible to eat food you’ve brought.  Moreover, there is a mezzanine with a hi-fi system, which makes you think of a nightclub and a terrace which is surrounded by trees and is really cozy.
Everyone has the right to go to the student common room, the students in the engineering cycle and the CPI’s. Furthermore, the BDE and the BDS (respectively student union and sports office) sometime organize parties in the student common room (for example barbecues) to bring the whole school together. For example, there is the Welcome Party every year for new students.

==Partners and networks==

The ECPM  participated to many different networks in order to communicate with factories, institutions or students.

That different networks are :

-The Gay- Lussac federation: The federation was found by Louis Joseph Gay Lussac.  It regroups no more than 19 schools of chemistry and chemical engineering. These 19 schools, through their teaching activities, research and training, are working together to raise awareness, develop and promote engineering courses in chemistry.

-The network “Alsace Tech“:  Alsace Tech regroups 12 reputed engineering, management and architecture schools of Alsace. Its main objective is to promote, to contribute to the national and international influence and to increase the legibility of its schools' members.

== Scientific Research ==

The ECPM is a hub for scientific research. Five laboratories associated with the [[:en:CNRS|CNRS]] form the ECPM's research federation. The fields of research are varied: materials, catalysis, polymers, organic synthesis, analysis of biomolecules. The laboratories collaborate with industries and major European research organizations as part of European agreements. A 1000m² hall with a [[cleanroom]] further the exchanges with industry.

'''Associated Laboratories'''

- The SYBIO Laboratory (Synthèse Organique et Molécules Bioactives)

- Laboratoire de Chimie Bioorganique et Médicale

- The Nierengarten group

- Laboratoire de Synthèse et Catalyse Asymétrique (SynCat)

- Laboratoire de Chimie organométallique

== Food services ==

You can find different kinds of food services in and around the campus.

- '''Restaurant universitaire (RU)''': this is the place where the majority of the students come everyday.  The choice is between three different main courses: today's special, world's dish, and the grill. Patrons can also take a starter and a dessert, the whole for 3€15. Dining is in a large room with all the campus' students: CPI, engineers, and students of the IUT Louis Pasteur.

- '''Mini R''' : It's a new concept ! It's located above the RU. The principle is the same as a cafeteria. You choose what you want: sandwiches, fagotine, fruits, desserts, drinks, and some hot food like pizzas, paninis, pasta and wok boxes, kebab, hot dog, etc. One can eat there or take away.

- '''Vending machine''':  in the school, next to the coffee machine. There are several kinds of sandwiches, but all of them are industrial.

- '''In the common room''': it is mainly the place where the engineers eat because they are contributors (prices are less expansive for them). For those bringing food from their flat, you can warm up there; there are ovens and stovetops.

- '''Fast food and supermarkets''': Finally, there is an area next to the IUT Louis Pasteur with fast food like Mac Donald, Mezzo di Pasta or supermarkets (Liddl, Intermarché).

== Ranking ==

According to the ''Point'' newspaper, the ECPM was ranked 18th in 2007 and was the leading chemistry schools in that rank (excluding chemical engineering) before the ENSCP which occupied the 30th rank. According to ''L'Express'', the school was ranked 27th as a ''post-prépa'' engineering school in 2008, behind the National School of Chemistry of Paris in the category of chemistry schools. Concerning starting incomes, the ECPM was ranked 10th by ''L'Usine Nouvelle'' in 2007. In the same newspaper, the ECPM is ranked 6th as a school betting on self-knowledge, that is to say, a school devoting a large part to non-scientific lectures.
