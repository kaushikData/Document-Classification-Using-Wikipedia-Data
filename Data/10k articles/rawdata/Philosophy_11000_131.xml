'''Abstract''' and '''concrete''' are classifications that denote whether the [[object (philosophy)|object]] that a term describes has physical [[referent|referents]]. Abstract objects have no physical referents, whereas concrete objects do. They are most commonly used in [[philosophy]] and [[semantics]]. Abstract objects are sometimes called '''''abstracta''''' (sing. '''''abstractum''''') and [[concrete object]]s are sometimes called ''[[wikt:concreta|concreta]]'' (sing. ''concretum''). An  abstract object is an [[object (philosophy)|object]] that does not exist at any particular time or place, but rather exists as a [[Type (metaphysics)|type]] of thing—i.e., an [[idea]], or [[abstraction]].&lt;ref name="A Glossary of Literary Terms"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUEtEa9nUWQC&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 September 2012|isbn=0495898023|author1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''abstract object'' is said to have been coined by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=D. M.|title=Sketch for a systematic metaphysics|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199655915|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of abstract objects is called [[abstract object theory]].

==In philosophy&lt;!--'Third Realm (Frege)' redirects here--&gt;==
The [[type–token distinction]] identifies physical objects that are tokens of a particular type of thing.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Philip (2012) "The Philosophy of Phonology" in ''Philosophy of Linguistics'' (ed. Kemp, Fernando, Asher), Elsevier, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;  The "type" of which it is a part is in itself an abstract object. The abstract-concrete distinction is often introduced and initially understood in terms of paradigmatic examples of objects of each kind:

Abstract objects have often garnered the interest of philosophers because they raise problems for popular theories. In [[ontology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[physicalism]] and some forms of [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]]. Historically, the most important ontological dispute about abstract objects has been the [[problem of universals]]. In [[epistemology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[empiricism]]. If abstracta lack causal powers or spatial location, how do we know about them? It is hard to say how they can affect our sensory experiences, and yet we seem to agree on a wide range of claims about them. 

Some, such as [[Edward Zalta]] and arguably, [[Plato]] in his [[Theory of Forms]], have held that abstract objects constitute the defining subject matter of [[metaphysics]] or philosophical inquiry more broadly. To the extent that philosophy is independent of empirical research, and to the extent that empirical questions do not inform questions about abstracta, philosophy would seem especially suited to answering these latter questions. 

In modern philosophy, the distinction between abstract and concrete was explored by [[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason|KrV]]'' A51/B75–6. See also: Edward Willatt, ''Kant, Deleuze and Architectonics'', Continuum, 2010 p. 17: "Kant argues that cognition can only come about as a result of the union of the abstract work of the understanding and the concrete input of sensation."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: ''[[The Science of Logic]]'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 609. See also: Richard Dien Winfield, ''Hegel's Science of Logic: A Critical Rethinking in Thirty Lectures'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2012, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]] said that abstract objects, such as numbers, were members of a '''third realm''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottlob Frege]], "Der Gedanke. Eine logische Untersuchung," in: ''Beiträge zur Philosophie des deutschen Idealismus'' 1 (1918/19), pp. 58–77; esp. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Popper's three worlds]].&lt;/ref&gt; different from the external world or from internal [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Gideon|title=Abstract Objects|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=1 January 2017|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Abstract objects and causality===
Another popular proposal for drawing the abstract-concrete distinction contends that an object is abstract if it lacks any [[causality|causal]] powers. A causal power has the ability to affect something causally. Thus, the empty set is abstract because it cannot act on other objects. One problem for this view is that it is not clear exactly what it is to have a causal power. For a more detailed exploration of the abstract-concrete distinction, follow the link below to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=abstract-objects |title=Abstract Objects |last=Rosen |first=Gideon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concrete and abstract thinking==
[[Jean Piaget]] uses the terms "concrete" and "formal" to describe the different types of learning.  Concrete thinking involves facts and descriptions about everyday, tangible objects, while abstract ([[Formal Operational#Formal operational stage|formal operational]]) thinking involves a mental process.

==Quasi-abstract entities==
Recently, there has been some philosophical interest in the development of a third category of objects known as the quasi-abstract. Quasi-abstract objects have drawn particular attention in the area of [[social ontology]] and [[documentality]]. Some argue that the over-adherence to the platonist duality of the concrete and the abstract has led to a large category of social objects having been overlooked or rejected as nonexisting because they exhibit characteristics that the traditional duality between concrete and abstract regards as incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;B. Smith (2008), "Searle and De Soto: The New Ontology of the Social World." In ''The Mystery of Capital and the Construction of Social Reality''. Open Court.&lt;/ref&gt; Specially, the ability to have temporal location, but not spatial location, and have causal agency (if only by acting through representatives).&lt;ref&gt;E. H.

H. Robinson (2014), "A Documentary Theory of States and Their Existence as Quasi-Abstract Entities," ''Geopolitics'' '''19''' (3), pp. 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alberto René Methol Ferré''' ([[Montevideo]], 31 March 1929 – 15 November 2009) was a Uruguayan thinker, writer, journalist, teacher, historian and theologian. He has been described as  one of Latin America's most fertile and original thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1203360 La positiva mirada de Methol Ferré] La Nación. Consultado el 28 de junio de 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Alberto Methol Ferré was born in Montevideo in 1929. He first studied in the Liceo Francés de Montevideo and then Law and Philosophy in the [[Universidad de la República]].

He was professor of Latin American History, of Contemporary History and of Theory of History in the University of Montevideo and in the Instituto Artigas de Servicio Exterior. He founded and coordinated the magazine ''Nexo'' (1955–1958, 1983–1989), he also worked for the magazine ''Víspera'' between 1967 and 1975.

He was active in the political Uruguayan landscape. He collaborated with [[Luis Alberto de Herrera]]; he worked in the agrarian movement with [[Benito Nardone]]; In the sixties he was involved in the leftish political party [[Unión Popular (Uruguay)|Unión Popular]] led by [[Enrique Erro]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larepublica.com.uy/politica/388810-murio-methol-ferre Murió Methol Ferré.]&lt;/ref&gt; he was also an assistant of [[Líber Seregni]] in the [[Broad Front (Uruguay)|Broad Front]].

He was a staunch supporter of [[Juan Domingo Perón]] and he considered himself more a [[Río de la Plata|rioplatense]] historian than a Uruguayan or an Argentinian one.

Between 1975 and 1992 he took part in a pastoral reflection team of the [[Latin American Episcopal Conference]], he was secretary for the laypeople and created courses of the Catholic Church History in Latin America between 1977 and 1982 in [[Medellín]] and in [[Bogotá]] ([[Colombia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rodolfowalsh.org/spip.php?auteur433 Alberto Methol Ferré]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also member of the [[Pontificio Consejo para los Laicos]] between 1980 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aciprensa.com/noticia.php?n=24034 |title=Obra de Methol Ferré en Internet |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124091431/http://www.aciprensa.com/noticia.php?n=24034 |archivedate=24 January 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was an agnostic and Methol just converted to Catholicism when 19. When young he was heavily influenced by the [[Generation of '98]].

He was awarded by Argentina with the [[Order of May]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacapital.com.ar/contenidos/2009/11/16/noticia_0017.html Falleció el historiador uruguayo Methol Ferré]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 he published a book with an interview by Alver Metalli which was introduced by then Archbishop of Buenos Aires and later pope [[Jorge Mario Bergoglio]]. Bergoglio adhered to his idea of "libertine atheism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1350753?eng=y The Pope and the Philosopher]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Montevideo in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com.uy/09/11/17/pespec_454688.asp Un adiós al maestro]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one author, he was an influence in the thought of [[Pope Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/cultural/sobreviven-papas-posmodernidad.html |title=Cómo sobreviven los papas a la posmodernidad |date=16 December 2016 |publisher=[[El País (Uruguay)|EL PAIS Cultural]] }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Analects''''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|論|語}}}}; [[Old Chinese]]: ''*run ŋ(r)aʔ''; {{zh|p=''lúnyǔ''|l=Edited Conversations}}),&lt;ref&gt;[[wiktionary:Appendix:Baxter-Sagart Old Chinese reconstruction]]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''''Analects of Confucius''''', is a collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]] and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been compiled and written by Confucius's followers. It is believed to have been written during the [[Warring States period]] (475–221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-[[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the ''Analects'' was considered merely a "commentary" on the [[Five Classics]], but the status of the ''Analects'' grew to be one of the central texts of [[Confucianism]] by the end of that dynasty. 

During the late [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) the importance of the ''Analects'' as a [[philosophical|philosophy]] work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the "[[Four Books]]". The ''Analects'' has been one of the most widely-read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and [[Eastern philosophy#East Asian philosophies|East Asian thought and values]] today.

Confucius believed that the welfare of a country depended on the moral cultivation of its people, beginning from the nation's leadership. He believed that individuals could begin to cultivate an all-encompassing sense of virtue through ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]]'', and that the most basic step to cultivating ''ren'' was [[Filial piety|devotion to one's parents]] and older siblings. He taught that one's individual desires do not need to be suppressed, but that people should be educated to reconcile their desires via [[Li (Confucian)|rituals and forms of propriety]], through which people could demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society. He taught that a ruler's sense of [[De (Chinese)|virtue]] was his primary prerequisite for leadership. His primary goal in educating his students was to produce [[Junzi|ethically well-cultivated men]] who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things.

===Creation of the text===
[[File:Confucius 02.png|thumb|Portrait of Confucius, giving a lecture]]

According to [[Ban Gu]], writing in the ''[[Book of Han]]'', the ''Analects'' originated as individual records kept by Confucius's disciples of conversations between the Master and them, which were then collected and jointly edited by the disciples after Confucius's death in 479 BC.  The work is therefore titled ''Lunyu'' meaning "edited conversations" or "selected speeches" (i.e. analects).{{sfnp|Knechtges|Shih|2010|p=645}}{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|p=25}}  This broadly forms the traditional account of the genesis of the work accepted by later generations of scholars, for example the [[Song dynasty]] neo-Confucian scholar [[Zhu Xi]] stated that ''Analects'' is the records of Confucius's first- and second-generation pupils.{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2013|p=26}} The view however was challenged by Qing dynasty [[philologist]] Cui Shu (崔述, 1740–1816) who argued  on linguistic ground that the last five books are much later than the rest of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqb0Fa8Umv4C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucius and the Analects : New Essays|author= Bryan W. Van Norden|page=13 |publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2002|isbn=9780195350821 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Slingerland|2003|pp=xiii-xiv}} Many modern scholars now believe that the work was compiled over a period of around two hundred years, with some questioning the authenticity of some of the sayings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ID4gMCaLr0MC&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucius and Confucianism: The Essentials|author=Lee Dian Rainey |page=10|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010 |isbn=9781444323603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Analects_of_Confucius_(Eno-2015).pdf |title=The Analects of Confucius |author=Robert Eno  |year=2015 |work=Indiana University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because no texts of the ''Analects'' have been discovered earlier, and because the ''Analects'' was not referred to by name in any existing source before the early Han dynasty, some scholars have proposed dates as late as 140 BC for the text's compilation.&lt;ref&gt;Els 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of how early the text of the ''Analects'' existed, most ''Analects'' scholars believe that, by the early [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD) the book was widely known and transmitted throughout China in a mostly complete form, and the book acquired its final, complete form during Han dynasty.  A Han dynasty writer [[Wang Chong]] however claimed that the ''Analects'' that existed during the Han dynasty was incomplete and formed only a part of a much larger work.{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|pp=25–26}}  A larger collection of Confucius's teachings existed in the Warring States period than has been preserved directly in the ''Analects'': 75% of Confucius's sayings cited by his second-generation student, [[Mencius]], do not exist in the received text of the ''Analects''.&lt;ref&gt;Waley 23&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Han dynasty scholar [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]], there were two versions of the ''Analects'' that existed at the beginning of the Han dynasty: the "[[Lu (state)|Lu]] version" and the "[[Qi (state)|Qi]] version". The Lu version contained twenty chapters, and the Qi version contained twenty-two chapters, including two chapters not found in the Lu version. Of the twenty chapters that both versions had in common, the Lu version had more passages. Each version had its own masters, schools, and transmitters.&lt;ref name=Gardner71516&gt;Gardner 7, 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;  In the reign of [[Emperor Jing of Han]] (r. 157–141 BC), a third version (the "[[Old Text]]" version) was discovered hidden in a wall of the home then believed to be Confucius's when the home was in the process of being destroyed by King Gong of Lu (r. 153–128 BC) in order to expand the king's palace. The new version did not contain the two extra chapters found in the Qi version, but it split one chapter found in the Lu and Qi versions in two, so it had twenty-one chapters, and the order of the chapters was different.&lt;ref name=Gardner71516 /&gt; The old text version got its name because it was written in characters not used since the earlier Warring States period (i.e. before 221 BC), when it was assumed to have been hidden.&lt;ref name="E20"&gt;Els 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Han dynasty scholar [[Huan Tan]], the old text version had four hundred characters different from the Lu version (from which the received text of the ''Analects'' is mostly based), and it seriously differed from the Lu version in twenty-seven places. Of these twenty-seven differences, the received text only agrees with the old text version in two places.&lt;ref name="W24"&gt;Waley 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a century later, the tutor of the ''Analects'' to [[Emperor Cheng of Han]], [[:zh:张禹 (西汉)|Zhang Yu]] (d. 5 BC), synthesized the Lu and Qi versions by taking the Lu version as authoritative and selectively adding sections from the Qi version, and produced a composite text of the ''Analects'' known as the "Zhang Hou Lun". This text was recognized by Zhang Yu's contemporaries and by subsequent Han scholars as superior to either individual version, and is the text that is recognized as the ''Analects'' today.&lt;ref name=Gardner71516 /&gt; The Qi version was lost for about 1800&amp;nbsp;years but re-found during the excavation of the tomb of [[Marquis of Haihun]] that was found 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0113/56820.html |title=Qi version of 'Analects of Confucius' discovered in Haihunhou tomb |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=The Institute of Archaeology |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116174212/http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0113/56820.html |archivedate=16 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No complete copies of either the Lu version or the old text version of the ''Analects'' exist today,&lt;ref name="E20" /&gt; though fragments of the old text version were discovered at [[Dunhuang manuscripts|Dunhuang]].&lt;ref name="W24" /&gt;

Before the late twentieth century the oldest existing copy of the ''Analects'' known to scholars was found in the "Stone Classics of the Xinping Era", a copy of the Confucian classics written in stone in the old Eastern Han dynasty capital of [[Luoyang]] around 175 AD. Archaeologists have since discovered two handwritten copies of the ''Analects'' that were written around 50 BC, during the Western Han dynasty. They are known as the "[[Dingzhou]] ''Analects''", and the "[[Pyongyang]] ''Analects''", after the location of the tombs in which they were found. The Dingzhou ''Analects'' was discovered in 1973, but no transcription of its contents was published until 1997. The Pyongyang ''Analects'' was discovered in 1992. Academic access to the Pyongyang ''Analects'' has been highly restricted, and no academic study on it was published until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Els 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dingzhou ''Analects'' was damaged in a fire shortly after it was entombed in the Han dynasty. It was further damaged in [[1976 Tangshan earthquake|an earthquake]] shortly after it was recovered, and the surviving text is just under half the size of the received text of the ''Analects''. Of the sections that survive, the Dingzhou ''Analects'' is shorter than the received ''Analects'', implying that the text of the ''Analects'' was still in the process of expansion when the Dingzhou ''Analects'' was entombed. There was evidence that "additions" may have been made to the manuscript after it had been completed, indicating that the writer may have become aware of at least one other version of the ''Analects'' and included "extra" material for the sake of completeness. The content of the Pyongyang ''Analects'' is similar to the Dingzhou ''Analects''; but, because of the secrecy and isolationism of the [[North Korea]]n government, only a very cursory study of it has been made available to international scholars, and its contents are not completely known outside of North Korea. Scholars do not agree about whether either the Dingzhou ''Analects'' or the Pyongyang ''Analects'' represent the Lu version, the Qi version, the old text version, or a different version that was independent of these three traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Els 6, 10–11, 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance within Confucianism===
During most of the Han period the ''Analects'' was not considered one of the principal texts of [[Confucianism]]. During the reign of [[Han Wudi]] (141–87 BC), when the Chinese government began promoting Confucian studies, only the [[Five Classics]] were considered by the government to be canonical (''jing''). They were considered Confucian because Confucius was assumed to have partially written, edited, and/or transmitted them. The ''Analects'' was considered secondary as it was thought to be merely a collection of Confucius's oral "commentary" (''zhuan'') on the Five Classics.&lt;ref name="G7"&gt;Gardner 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The political importance and popularity of Confucius and Confucianism grew throughout the Han dynasty, and by the [[Han Dynasty|Eastern Han]] the ''Analects'' was widely read by schoolchildren and anyone aspiring to literacy, and often read before the Five Classics themselves. During the Eastern Han, the heir apparent was provided a tutor specifically to teach him the ''Analects''. The growing importance of the ''Analects'' was recognized when the Five Classics was expanded to the "Seven Classics": the Five Classics plus the ''Analects'' and the ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', and its status as one of the central texts of Confucianism continued to grow until the late [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), when it was identified and promoted as one of the [[Four Books]] by [[Zhu Xi]] and generally accepted as being more insightful than the older Five Classics.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 8, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentaries===
[[File:Commentaries of the Analects of Confucius.jpg|thumb|right|A copy of He Yan's commentary on the ''Analects'', with a sub-commentary by [[Xing Bing]], printed during the [[Ming dynasty]]]]
Since the Han dynasty, Chinese readers have interpreted the ''Analects'' by reading scholars' commentaries on the book. There have been many commentaries on the ''Analects'' since the Han dynasty, but the two which have been most influential have been the ''Collected Explanations of the Analects'' (''Lunyu Jijie'') by [[He Yan]] (c.&amp;nbsp;195–249) and several colleagues, and the ''Collected Commentaries of the Analects'' (''Lunyu Jizhu'') by [[Zhu Xi]] (1130–1200). In his work, He Yan collected, selected, summarized, and rationalized what he believed to be the most insightful of all preceding commentaries on the ''Analects'' which had been produced by earlier Han and [[Cao Wei|Wei dynasty]] (220–265&amp;nbsp;AD) scholars. His personal interpretation of the ''Lunyu'' was guided by his belief that [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]] complemented each other, so that by studying both in a correct manner a scholar could arrive at a single, unified truth. Arguing for the ultimate compatibility of Daoist and Confucian teachings, he argued that "Laozi [in fact] was in agreement with the Sage" (sic). The ''Explanations'' was written in 248&amp;nbsp;AD, was quickly recognized as authoritative, and remained the standard guide to interpreting the ''Analects'' for nearly 1,000 years, until the early [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368). It is the oldest complete commentary on the ''Analects'' that still exists.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 8, 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

He Yan's commentary was eventually displaced as the definitive, standard commentary by Zhu Xi's commentary. Zhu Xi's work also brought together the commentaries of earlier scholars (mostly from the Song dynasty), along with his own interpretations. Zhu's work took part in the context of a period of renewed interest in Confucian studies, in which Chinese scholars were interested in producing a single "correct" intellectual orthodoxy that would "save" Chinese traditions and protect them from foreign influences, and in which scholars were increasingly interested in metaphysical speculation.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 18–20, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In his commentary Zhu made a great effort to interpret the ''Analects'' by using theories elaborated in the other Four Books, something that He Yan had not done. Zhu attempted to give an added coherence and unity to the message of the ''Analects'', demonstrating that the individual books of the Confucian canon gave meaning to the whole, just as the whole of the canon gave meaning to its parts. In his preface, Zhu Xi stated, "[T]he ''Analects'' and the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' are the most important works for students pursuing the [[Tao|Way]] [...] The words of the ''Analects'' are all inclusive; what they teach is nothing but the essentials of preserving the mind and cultivating [one's] nature." From the first publication of the ''Commentaries'', Zhu continued to refine his interpretation for the last thirty years of his life. In the fourteenth century, the [[Ming dynasty|Chinese government]] endorsed Zhu's commentary, and until 1905 it was read and memorized along with the ''Analects'' by all Chinese aspiring to literacy and employment as government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 7–8, 21, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Very few reliable sources about Confucius exist besides that of the Analects. The principal biography available to historians is included in [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Shiji]]'', but, because the ''Shiji'' contains a large amount of (possibly legendary) material not confirmed by extant sources, the biographical material on Confucius found in the ''Analects'' makes the ''Analects'' arguably the most reliable source of biographical information about Confucius.&lt;ref&gt;Lau ix&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius viewed himself as a "transmitter" of  social and political traditions originating in the early [[Zhou dynasty]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1000–800 BC), and claimed not to have originated anything (''Analects'' 7.1), but Confucius's social and political ideals were not popular in his time.&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;Riegel "2. Confucius' Social Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social philosophy===
Confucius's discussions on the nature of the supernatural (''Analects'' 3.12; 6.20; 11.11) indicate that he believed while "ghosts" and "spirits" should be respected, they are best kept at a distance. Instead human beings should base their values and social ideals on moral philosophy, tradition, and a natural love for others. Confucius's social philosophy largely depended on the cultivation of [[Ren (Confucianism)|''ren'']] by every individual in a community.&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; Later Confucian philosophers explained ''ren'' as the quality of having a kind manner, similar to the English words "humane", "altruistic", or "benevolent", but, of the sixty instances in which Confucius discusses ''ren'' in the ''Analects'', very few have these later meanings. Confucius instead used the term ''ren'' to describe an extremely general and all-encompassing state of virtue, one which no living person had attained completely. (This use of the term ''ren'' is peculiar to the ''Analects''.)&lt;ref&gt;Waley 27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the ''Analects'', Confucius's students frequently request that Confucius define ''ren'' and give examples of people who embody it, but Confucius generally responds indirectly to his students' questions, instead offering illustrations and examples of behaviours that are associated with ''ren'' and explaining how a person could achieve it. According to Confucius, a person with a well-cultivated sense of ''ren'' would speak carefully and modestly (''Analects'' 12.3); be resolute and firm (''Analects'' 12.20), courageous (''Analects'' 14.4), free from worry, unhappiness, and insecurity (''Analects'' 9.28; 6.21); moderate their desires and return to propriety (''Analects'' 12.1); be respectful, tolerant, diligent, trustworthy and kind (''Analects'' 17.6); and love others (''Analects'' 12.22). Confucius recognized his followers' disappointment that he would not give them a more comprehensive definition of ''ren'', but assured them that he was sharing all that he could (''Analects'' 7.23).&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

To Confucius, the cultivation of ''ren'' involved depreciating oneself through modesty while avoiding artful speech and ingratiating manners that would create a false impression of one's own character (''Analects'' 1.3). Confucius said that those who had cultivated ''ren'' could be distinguished by their being "simple in manner and slow of speech." He believed that people could cultivate their sense of ''ren'' through exercising the inverted [[Golden Rule]]: "Do not do to others what you would not like done to yourself"; "a man with ''ren'', desiring to establish himself, helps others establish themselves; desiring to succeed himself, helps others to succeed" (''Analects'' 12.2; 6.28).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; He taught that the ability of people to imagine and project themselves into the places of others was a crucial quality for the pursuit of moral self-cultivation (''Analects'' 4.15; see also 5.12; 6.30; 15.24).&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland 34&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius regarded the exercise of [[Filial piety|devotion to one's parents]] and older siblings as the simplest, most basic way to cultivate ''ren''. (''Analects'' 1.2).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;

Confucius believed that ''ren'' could best be cultivated by those who had already learned self-discipline, and that self-discipline was best learned by practicing and cultivating one's understanding of [[Li (Confucian)|''li'']]: rituals and forms of propriety through which people demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society (''Analects'' 3.3). Confucius said that one's understanding of ''li'' should inform everything that one says and does (''Analects'' 12.1). He believed that subjecting oneself to ''li'' did not mean suppressing one's desires, but learning to reconcile them with the needs of one's family and broader community. By leading individuals to express their desires within the context of social responsibility, Confucius and his followers taught that the public cultivation of ''li'' was the basis of a well-ordered society (''Analects'' 2.3).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; Confucius taught his students that an important aspect of ''li'' was observing the practical social differences that exist between people in daily life. In [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] these "five relationships" include: ruler to ruled; father to son; husband to wife; elder brother to younger brother; and friend to friend.

''Ren'' and ''li'' have a special relationship in the ''Analects'': ''li'' manages one's relationship with one's family and close community, while ''ren'' is practiced broadly and informs one's interactions with all people. Confucius did not believe that ethical self-cultivation meant unquestioned loyalty to an evil ruler. He argued that the demands of ''ren'' and ''li'' meant that rulers could oppress their subjects only at their own peril: "You may rob the Three Armies of their commander, but you cannot deprive the humblest peasant of his opinion" (''Analects'' 9.26). Confucius said that a morally well-cultivated individual would regard his devotion to loving others as a mission for which he would be willing to die (''Analects'' 15.8).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;

===Political philosophy===
Confucius's political beliefs were rooted in his belief that a good ruler would be self-disciplined, would govern his subjects through education and by his own example, and would seek to correct his subjects with love and concern rather than punishment and coercion. "If the people be led by laws, and uniformity among them be sought by punishments, they will try to escape punishment and have no sense of shame. If they are led by virtue, and uniformity sought among them through the practice of ritual propriety, they will possess a sense of shame and come to you of their own accord" (''Analects'' 2.3; see also 13.6). Confucius's political theories were directly contradictory to the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalistic]] political orientations of China's rulers, and he failed to popularize his ideals among China's leaders within his own lifetime.&lt;ref name="r3"&gt;Riegel "3. Confucius' Political Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius believed that the social chaos of his time was largely due to China's ruling elite aspiring to, and claiming, titles of which they were unworthy. When the ruler of the large state of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] asked Confucius about the principles of good government, Confucius responded: "Good government consists in the ruler being a ruler, the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a son" (''Analects'' 12.11). Confucius's analysis of the need to raise officials' behavior to reflect the way that they identify and describe themselves is known as the [[rectification of names]], and he stated that the rectification of names should be the first responsibility of a ruler upon taking office (''Analects'' 13.3). Confucius believed that, because the ruler was the model for all who were under him in society, the rectification of names had to begin with the ruler, and that afterwards others would change to imitate him (''Analects'' 12.19).&lt;ref name="r3" /&gt;

Confucius judged a good ruler by his possession of ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'' ("virtue"): a sort of moral force that allows those in power to rule and gain the loyalty of others without the need for physical coercion (''Analects'' 2.1). Confucius said that one of the most important ways that a ruler cultivates his sense of ''de'' is through a devotion to the correct practices of ''li''. Examples of rituals identified by Confucius as important to cultivate a ruler's ''de'' include: sacrificial rites held at ancestral temples to express thankfulness and humility; ceremonies of enfeoffment, toasting, and gift exchanges that bound nobility in complex hierarchical relationships of obligation and indebtedness; and, acts of formal politeness and decorum (i.e. bowing and yielding) that identify the performers as morally well-cultivated.&lt;ref name="r3" /&gt;

===Education===
The importance of education and study is a fundamental theme of the ''Analects''. For Confucius, a good student respects and learns from the words and deeds of his teacher, and a good teacher is someone older who is familiar with the ways of the past and the practices of antiquity '''(''Analects'' 7.22)'''. Confucius emphasized the need to find balance between formal study and intuitive self-reflection '''(''Analects'' 2.15)'''. When teaching he is never cited in the ''Analects'' as lecturing at length about any subject, but instead challenges his students to discover the truth through [[Socratic method|asking direct questions]], citing passages from the classics, and using analogies '''(''Analects'' 7.8)'''.&lt;ref name="Riegel4"&gt;Riegel 4 "Confucius and Education"&lt;/ref&gt; He sometimes required his students to demonstrate their understanding of subjects by making intuitive conceptual leaps before accepting their understanding and discussing those subjects at greater levels of depth. '''(''Analects'' 3.8)'''&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

His primary goal in educating his students was to produce [[Junzi|ethically well-cultivated men]] who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things '''(''Analects'' 12.11; see also 13.3)'''. He was willing to teach anyone regardless of social class, as long as they were sincere, eager, and tireless to learn '''(''Analects'' 7.7; 15.38)'''. He is traditionally credited with teaching three thousand students, though only seventy are said to have mastered what he taught. He taught [[Six Arts|practical skills]], but regarded moral self-cultivation as his most important subject.&lt;ref name="Riegel4" /&gt;

===Chapters===
In China, the traditional titles given to each chapter are mostly an initial two or three [[incipit]]s. In some cases a title may indicate a central theme of a chapter, but it is inappropriate to regard a title as a description or generalization of the content of a chapter. Chapters in the ''Analects'' are grouped by individual themes, but the chapters are not arranged in a way as to carry a continuous stream of thoughts or ideas. The themes of adjacent chapters are completely unrelated to each other. Central themes recur repeatedly in different chapters, sometimes in exactly the same wording and sometimes with small variations.

Chapter 10 contains detailed descriptions of Confucius's behaviors in various daily activities. [[Voltaire]] and [[Ezra Pound]] believed that this chapter demonstrated how Confucius was a mere human. [[Simon Leys]], who recently translated the ''Analects'' into English and French, said that the book may have been the first in human history to describe the life of an individual, historic personage. [[Elias Canetti]] wrote: "Confucius's ''Analects'' is the oldest complete intellectual and spiritual portrait of a man. It strikes one as a modern book; everything it contains and indeed everything it lacks is important."&lt;ref&gt;Canetti 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Within these incipits a large number of passages in the Analects begin with the formulaic ''ziyue'', "The Master said," but without  punctuation marks in classical Chinese, this does not confirm whether what follows ''ziyue'' is direct quotation of actual sayings of Confucius, or simply to be understood as "the Master said that.." and the paraphrase of Confucius by the compilers of the Analects.&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Ames ''The Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation'' 2010 p. 285 "A large number of passages in the Analects begin with the formulaic ziyue 子曰, "The Master said," but because there are no punctuation marks in classical Chinese, we must ask if whatever follows ziyue is a literal transcription of speech, or a paraphrase of it, or a method of transmitting ideas in a written language which existed in important ways independently of the spoken language."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:"The School of Athens" by Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509-1511) by [[Raphael]], depicting famous classical Greek philosophers in an idealized setting inspired by [[ancient Greek architecture]]]]

'''Ancient Greek philosophy''' arose in the 6th century BC and continued throughout the [[Hellenistic period]] and the period in which [[Ancient Greece]] was part of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Philosophy]] was used to make sense out of the world in a non-religious way. It dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including [[political philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], [[logic]], [[biology]], [[rhetoric]] and [[aesthetics]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Many [[philosopher]]s around the world agree that Greek philosophy has influenced much of [[Western culture]] since its inception. [[Alfred North Whitehead]] once noted: "The safest general characterization of the [[Europe]]an philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato".&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead (1929), ''[[Process and Reality]]'', Part II, Chap. I, Sect. I.&lt;/ref&gt; Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophers]] to [[Early Islamic philosophy]], the European [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kevinscharp.com/Kevin%20Scharp%20-%20%20Diagrams.htm Kevin Scharp (Department of Philosophy, Ohio State University) – Diagrams] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031222017/http://kevinscharp.com/Kevin%20Scharp%20-%20%20Diagrams.htm |date=2014-10-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that Greek philosophy was in turn influenced by the older [[wisdom literature]] and mythological cosmogonies of the [[ancient Near East]], though this is debated. [[Martin Litchfield West]] gives qualified assent to this view by stating that "contact with oriental [[cosmology]] and [[theology]] helped to liberate the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|early Greek philosophers']] imagination; it certainly gave them many suggestive ideas. But they taught themselves to reason. Philosophy as we understand it is a Greek creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Griffin, Jasper |author2=Boardman, John |author3=Murray, Oswyn |title=The Oxford history of Greece and the Hellenistic world |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2001 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7fY2eCEFkKgC&amp;pg=PA140 140]|isbn=0-19-280137-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent philosophic tradition was so influenced by [[Socrates]] as presented by [[Plato]] that it is conventional to refer to philosophy developed prior to Socrates as [[pre-Socratic philosophy]]. The periods following this, up to and after the [[wars of Alexander the Great]], are those of "classical Greek" and "Hellenistic" philosophy.

== Pre-Socratic philosophy ==
{{Main article|Pre-Socratic philosophy}}
The convention of terming those [[philosophers]] who were active prior to [[Socrates]] the ''pre-Socratics'' gained currency with the 1903 publication of [[Hermann Alexander Diels|Hermann Diels']] ''Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', although the term did not originate with him.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Whitlock, preface to ''The Pre-Platonic Philosophers'', by Friedrich Nietzsche (Urbana:  University of Illinois Press, 2001), xiv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- A better reference for this fact should be found; this is just one I had handy. --&gt; The term is considered philosophically useful because what came to be known as the "Athenian school" (composed of Socrates, Plato, and [[Aristotle]]) signaled a profound shift in the subject matter and methods of philosophy; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s thesis that this shift began with Plato rather than with Socrates (hence his nomenclature of "pre-Platonic philosophy") has not prevented the predominance of the "pre-Socratic" distinction.&lt;ref name="Whitlock"&gt;Greg Whitlock, preface to ''The Pre-Platonic Philosophers'', by Friedrich Nietzsche (Urbana:  University of Illinois Press, 2001), xiii–xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Socratics were primarily concerned with [[cosmology]], [[ontology]] and [[mathematics]]. They were distinguished from "non-philosophers" insofar as they rejected mythological explanations in favor of reasoned discourse.&lt;ref&gt;John Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy:  Thales to Plato'', 3rd ed. (London: A &amp; C Black Ltd., 1920), 3–16.  [https://archive.org/stream/p1greekphilosoph00burnuoft#page/n9/mode/2up Scanned version from Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Milesian school ===
{{Main article|Milesian school}}
[[Thales of Miletus]], regarded by [[Aristotle]] as the first philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics Alpha'']], 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt; held that all things arise from a single material substance, water.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics Alpha'', 983 b6 8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not because he gave a [[cosmogony]] that [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] calls him the "first man of science," but because he gave a naturalistic explanation of the [[cosmos]] and supported it with reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 3–4, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, Thales was able to predict an [[solar eclipse|eclipse]] and taught the Egyptians how to measure the height of the [[pyramids]].&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 18–20; [[Herodotus]], [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']], I.74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thales inspired the [[Milesian school]] of philosophy and was followed by [[Anaximander]], who argued that the substratum or [[arche#Arche in ancient Greek Philosophy|''arche'']] could not be water or any of the [[classical element]]s but was instead something "unlimited" or "indefinite" (in Greek, the ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]''). He began from the observation that the world seems to consist of opposites (e.g., hot and cold), yet a thing can become its opposite (e.g., a hot thing cold). Therefore, they cannot truly be opposites but rather must both be manifestations of some underlying unity that is neither. This underlying unity (substratum, ''arche'') could not be any of the classical elements, since they were one extreme or another. For example, water is wet, the opposite of dry, while fire is dry, the opposite of wet.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; This initial state is ageless and  imperishable, and everything returns to it according to necessity &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;hl=el&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Guthrie, p.83]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] in turn held that the ''arche'' was air, although John Burnet argues that by this he meant that it was a transparent mist, the [[aether (classical element)|''aether'']].&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their varied answers, the Milesian school was searching for a natural substance that would remain unchanged despite appearing in different forms, and thus represents one of the first scientific attempts to answer the question that would lead to the development of modern atomic theory; "the Milesians," says Burnet, "asked for the [[physis|''φύσις'']]&lt;!--Greek italics in the original--&gt; of all things."&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Xenophanes ===

{{Main article|Xenophanes}}

Xenophanes was born in [[Ionia]], where the Milesian school was at its most powerful, and may have picked up some of the Milesians' cosmological theories as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  What is known is that he argued that each of the phenomena had a natural rather than divine explanation in a manner reminiscent of Anaximander's theories and that there was only one god, the world as a whole, and that he ridiculed the [[anthropomorphism]] of the Greek religion by claiming that cattle would claim that the gods looked like cattle, horses like horses, and lions like lions, just as the Ethiopians claimed that the gods were snubnosed and black and the Thracians claimed they were pale and red-haired.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 35; Diels-Kranz, ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', Xenophanes, frs. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnet says that Xenophanes was not, however, a scientific man, with many of his "naturalistic" explanations having no further support than that they render the Homeric gods superfluous or foolish.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  He has been claimed as an influence on [[Eleatics|Eleatic philosophy]], although that is disputed, and a precursor to [[Epicurus]], a representative of a total break between science and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 33, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pythagoreanism ===

{{Main article|Pythagoreanism}}

[[Pythagoras]] lived at roughly the same time that Xenophanes did and, in contrast to the latter, the school that he founded sought to reconcile religious belief and reason.  Little is known about his life with any reliability, however, and no writings of his survive, so it is possible that he was simply a [[mysticism|mystic]] whose successors introduced rationalism into Pythagoreanism, that he was simply a [[rationalism|rationalist]] whose successors are responsible for the mysticism in Pythagoreanism, or that he was actually the author of the doctrine; there is no way to know for certain.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pythagoras is said to have been a disciple of [[Anaximander]] and to have imbibed the [[cosmology|cosmological]] concerns of the Ionians, including the idea that the cosmos is constructed of spheres, the importance of the infinite, and that air or aether is the ''arche'' of everything.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pythagoreanism also incorporated [[asceticism|ascetic]] ideals, emphasizing purgation, [[metempsychosis]], and consequently a respect for all animal life; much was made of the correspondence between mathematics and the cosmos in a musical harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 40–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics, and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra 1957 ''The Greek experience'' p. 166"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heraclitus ===
{{Main article|Heraclitus}}
Heraclitus must have lived after Xenophanes and Pythagoras, as he condemns them along with [[Homer]] as proving that much learning cannot teach a man to think; since [[Parmenides]] refers to him in the past tense, this would place him in the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to the [[Milesian school]], which posits one stable [[Classical element|element]] as the ''[[arche]]'', Heraclitus taught that ''[[Panta rhei (Heraclitus)|panta rhei]]'' ("everything flows"), the closest element to this eternal flux being fire. All things come to pass in accordance with ''Logos'',&lt;ref&gt;DK B1.&lt;/ref&gt; which must be considered as "plan" or "formula",&lt;ref&gt;pp. 419ff., [[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''A History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, Cambridge University Press, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the ''Logos'' is common".&lt;ref&gt;DK B2.&lt;/ref&gt; He also posited a [[unity of opposites]], expressed through [[dialectic]], which structured this flux, such as that seeming opposites in fact are manifestations of a common substrate to good and evil itself.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 57–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraclitus called the oppositional processes ἔρις (''[[Eris (mythology)|eris]]''), "strife", and hypothesized that the apparently stable state of δίκη (''[[Dike (mythology)|dikê]]''), or "justice", is the [[Harmonia (mythology)|harmonic]] unity of these opposites.&lt;ref&gt;DK B80&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eleatic philosophy ===
{{Main article|Eleatics}}
[[Parmenides of Elea]] cast his philosophy against those who held "it is and is not the same, and all things travel in opposite directions,"—presumably referring to Heraclitus and those who followed him.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 64.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the doctrines of the Milesian school, in suggesting that the substratum could appear in a variety of different guises, implied that everything that exists is corpuscular, Parmenides argued that the first principle of being was One, indivisible, and unchanging.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Being, he argued, by definition implies eternality, while only that which ''is'' can be thought; a thing which ''is'', moreover, cannot be more or less, and so the rarefaction and condensation of the Milesians is impossible regarding Being; lastly, as movement requires that something exist apart from the thing moving (viz. the space into which it moves), the One or Being cannot move, since this would require that "space" both exist and not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; While this doctrine is at odds with ordinary sensory experience, where things do indeed change and move, the Eleatic school followed Parmenides in denying that sense phenomena revealed the world as it actually was; instead, the only thing with Being was thought, or the question of whether something exists or not is one of whether it can be thought.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of this, Parmenides' pupil [[Zeno of Elea]] attempted to prove that the concept of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] was absurd and as such motion did not exist. He also attacked the subsequent development of pluralism, arguing that it was incompatible with Being.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 82.&lt;/ref&gt; His arguments are known as [[Zeno's paradoxes]].

=== Pluralism and atomism ===
The power of Parmenides' logic was such that some subsequent philosophers abandoned the [[monism]] of the Milesians, Xenophanes, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, where one thing was the ''arche'', and adopted [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]], such as [[Empedocles]] and [[Anaxagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt; There were, they said, multiple elements which were not reducible to one another and these were set in motion by love and strife (as in Empedocles) or by Mind (as in Anaxagoras). Agreeing with Parmenides that there is no coming into being or passing away, genesis or decay, they said that things appear to come into being and pass away because the elements out of which they are composed assemble or disassemble while themselves being unchanging.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leucippus]] also proposed an ontological pluralism with a cosmogony based on two main elements: the vacuum and atoms. These, by means of their inherent movement, are crossing the void and creating the real material bodies. His theories were not well known by the time of [[Plato]], however, and they were ultimately incorporated into the work of his student, [[Democritus]].&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sophistry ===
{{Main article|Sophists}}
Sophistry arose from the juxtaposition of ''[[physis]]'' (nature) and ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' (law). John Burnet posits its origin in the scientific progress of the previous centuries which suggested that Being was radically different from what was experienced by the senses and, if comprehensible at all, was not comprehensible in terms of order; the world in which men lived, on the other hand, was one of law and order, albeit of humankind's own making.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 105–10.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, nature was constant, while what was by law differed from one place to another and could be changed.

The first man to call himself a sophist, according to Plato, was [[Protagoras]], whom he presents as teaching that all [[virtue]] is conventional. It was Protagoras who claimed that "man is the measure of all things, of the things that are, that they are, and of the things that are not, that they are not," which Plato interprets as a radical [[perspectivism]], where some things seem to be one way for one person (and so actually are that way) and another way for another person (and so actually are ''that'' way as well); the conclusion being that one cannot look to nature for guidance regarding how to live one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet, ''Greek Philosophy'', 113–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Protagoras and subsequent sophists tended to teach rhetoric as their primary vocation. [[Prodicus]], [[Gorgias]], [[Hippias]], and [[Thrasymachus]] appear in various [[Plato's dialogues#The dialogues|dialogues]], sometimes explicitly teaching that while nature provides no ethical guidance, the guidance that the laws provide is worthless, or that nature favors those who act against the laws.

=== Socrates ===
{{Main article|Socrates}}
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}
Socrates, born in [[Classical Athens|Athens]] in the 5th century BCE, marks a watershed in ancient Greek philosophy.  Athens was a center of learning, with sophists and philosophers traveling from across Greece to teach rhetoric, astronomy, cosmology, geometry, and the like.  The great statesman [[Pericles]] was closely associated with this new learning and a friend of [[Anaxagoras]], however, and his political opponents struck at him by taking advantage of a conservative reaction against the philosophers; it became a crime to investigate the things above the heavens or below the earth, subjects considered impious. Anaxagoras is said to have been charged and to have fled into exile when Socrates was about twenty years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Nails, ''The People of Plato'' (Indianapolis:  Hackett, 2002), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a story that [[Protagoras]], too, was forced to flee and that the Athenians burned his books.&lt;ref&gt;Nails, ''People of Plato'', 256.&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates, however, is the only subject recorded as charged under this law, convicted, and sentenced to death in 399 BCE (see [[Trial of Socrates]]). In the version of his [[Apology (Plato)|defense speech]] presented by Plato, he claims that it is the envy he arouses on account of his being a philosopher that will convict him.

While philosophy was an established pursuit prior to Socrates, [[Cicero]] credits him as "the first who brought philosophy down from the heavens, placed it in cities, introduced it into families, and obliged it to examine into life and morals, and good and evil."&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', V 10–11 (or V IV).&lt;/ref&gt; By this account he would be considered the founder of [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, ''Natural Right and History'' (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 1953), 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this turn toward political and ethical subjects remain the object of much study.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Benardete, ''The Argument of the Action'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000), 277–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Lampert, ''How Philosophy Became Socratic'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that many conversations involving Socrates (as recounted by Plato and [[Xenophon]]) end without having reached a firm conclusion, or [[aporia|aporetically]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Plato]], [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] 336c &amp; 337a, [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|''Theaetetus'']] 150c, [[Apology (Plato)|''Apology of Socrates'']] 23a; [[Xenophon]], [[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|''Memorabilia'']] 4.4.9; [[Aristotle]], ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'' 183b7.&lt;/ref&gt; has stimulated debate over the meaning of the [[Socratic method]].&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''The Greek Philosophers'' (London: Methuen, 1950), 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt;  Socrates is said to have pursued this probing question-and-answer style of examination on a number of topics, usually attempting to arrive at a defensible and attractive definition of a [[virtue]].

While Socrates' recorded conversations rarely provide a definite answer to the question under examination, several maxims or paradoxes for which he has become known recur.  Socrates taught that no one desires what is bad, and so if anyone does something that truly is bad, it must be unwillingly or out of ignorance; consequently, all virtue is knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Irwin]], ''The Development of Ethics'', vol. 1 (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2007), 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerasimos Santas, "The Socratic Paradoxes", ''Philosophical Review'' 73 (1964): 147–64, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently remarks on his own ignorance (claiming that he does not know what courage is, for example). [[Plato]] presents him as distinguishing himself from the common run of mankind by the fact that, while they know nothing noble and good, they do not ''know'' that they do not know, whereas Socrates knows and acknowledges that he knows nothing noble and good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apology (Plato)|''Apology of Socrates'']] 21d.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous subsequent philosophical movements were inspired by Socrates or his younger associates. Plato casts Socrates as the main interlocutor in his [[Plato#Works|dialogues]], deriving from them the basis of [[Platonism]] (and by extension, [[Neoplatonism]]). Plato's student [[Aristotle]] in turn criticized and built upon the doctrines he ascribed to Socrates and Plato, forming the foundation of [[Aristotelianism]]. [[Antisthenes]] founded the school that would come to be known as [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]] and accused Plato of distorting Socrates' teachings. [[Zeno of Citium]] in turn adapted the ethics of Cynicism to articulate [[Stoicism]]. [[Epicurus]] studied with Platonic and Stoic teachers before renouncing all previous philosophers (including [[Democritus]], on whose atomism the [[Epicurean]] philosophy relies). The philosophic movements that were to dominate the intellectual life of the [[Roman empire]] were thus born in this febrile period following Socrates' activity, and either directly or indirectly influenced by him.  They were also absorbed by the expanding Muslim world in the 7th through 10th centuries AD, from which they returned to the West as foundations of [[Medieval philosophy]] and the [[Renaissance]], as discussed below.

=== Plato ===
{{Main article|Plato}}
Plato was an [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] of the generation after [[Socrates]].  Ancient tradition ascribes thirty-six dialogues and thirteen [[Epistles (Plato)|letters]] to him, although of these only twenty-four of the dialogues are now universally recognized as authentic; most modern scholars believe that at least twenty-eight dialogues and two of the letters were in fact written by Plato, although all of the thirty-six dialogues have some defenders.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Cooper, ed., ''Complete Works'', by Plato (Indianapolis:  Hackett, 1997), v–vi, viii–xii, 1634–35.&lt;/ref&gt; A further nine dialogues are ascribed to Plato but were considered spurious even in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, ed., ''Complete Works'', by Plato, v–vi, viii–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's dialogues feature Socrates, although not always as the leader of the conversation. (One dialogue, the [[Laws (Plato)|''Laws'']], instead contains an "Athenian Stranger.")  Along with [[Xenophon]], Plato is the primary source of information about Socrates' life and beliefs and it is not always easy to distinguish between the two.  While the Socrates presented in the dialogues is often taken to be Plato's mouthpiece, Socrates' reputation for [[irony]], his caginess regarding his own opinions in the dialogues, and his occasional absence from or minor role in the conversation serve to conceal Plato's doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leo Strauss]], ''The City and Man'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1964), 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of what is said about his doctrines is derived from what Aristotle reports about them.

The political doctrine ascribed to Plato is derived from the [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']], the [[Laws (dialogue)|''Laws'']], and the [[Statesman (dialogue)|''Statesman'']].  The first of these contains the suggestion that there will not be justice in cities unless they are ruled by [[philosopher king]]s; those responsible for enforcing the laws are compelled to hold their women, children, and property in [[communism|common]]; and the individual is taught to pursue the common good through [[noble lie]]s; the ''Republic'' says that such a city is likely impossible, however, generally assuming that philosophers would refuse to rule and the people would refuse to compel them to do so.&lt;ref name="Strauss Plato"&gt;Leo Strauss, "Plato", in ''History of Political Philosophy'', ed. Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, 3rd ed. (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press 1987): 33–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the ''Republic'' is premised on a distinction between the sort of knowledge possessed by the philosopher and that possessed by the king or political man, Socrates explores only the character of the philosopher; in the ''Statesman'', on the other hand, a participant referred to as the Eleatic Stranger discusses the sort of knowledge possessed by the political man, while Socrates listens quietly.&lt;ref name="Strauss Plato" /&gt;  Although rule by a wise man would be preferable to rule by law, the wise cannot help but be judged by the unwise, and so in practice, rule by law is deemed necessary.

Both the ''Republic'' and the ''Statesman'' reveal the limitations of politics, raising the question of what political order would be best given those constraints; that question is addressed in the ''Laws'', a dialogue that does not take place in Athens and from which Socrates is absent.&lt;ref name="Strauss Plato" /&gt; The character of the society described there is eminently conservative, a corrected or liberalized [[timocracy]] on the [[Sparta#Classical Sparta|Spartan]] or [[History of Crete#Classical, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and Arab Crete|Cretan]] model or that of pre-democratic [[Classical Athens|Athens]].&lt;ref name="Strauss Plato" /&gt;

Plato's dialogues also have [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, the most famous of which is his [[theory of forms]].  It holds that non-material abstract (but [[ousia|substantial]]) forms (or ideas), and not the material world of change known to us through our physical senses, possess the highest and most fundamental kind of reality.

Plato often uses long-form [[analogies]] (usually [[allegories]]) to explain his ideas; the most famous is perhaps the [[Allegory of the Cave]]. It likens most humans to people tied up in a cave, who look only at shadows on the walls and have no other conception of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classicalastrologer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/plato-allegory-of-the-cave.pdf|format=PDF|title=Plato - Allegory of the cave|website=classicalastrologer.files.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they turned around, they would see what is casting the shadows (and thereby gain a further dimension to their reality). If some left the cave, they would see the outside world illuminated by the sun (representing the ultimate form of goodness and truth). If these travelers then re-entered the cave, the people inside (who are still only familiar with the shadows) would not be equipped to believe reports of this 'outside world'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/cave.htm|title=Allegory of the Cave|work=washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story explains the theory of forms with their different levels of reality, and advances the view that philosopher-kings are wisest while most humans are ignorant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2h.htm|title=Plato: The Republic 5-10|author=Garth Kemerling|work=philosophypages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; One student of Plato (who would become another of the most influential philosophers of all time) stressed the implication that understanding relies upon first-hand observation.

=== Aristotle ===
{{Main article|Aristotle}}
Aristotle moved to Athens from his native [[Stageira]] in 367 BC and began to study philosophy (perhaps even rhetoric, under [[Isocrates]]), eventually enrolling at [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]].&lt;ref name="Lord Intro"&gt;Carnes Lord, Introduction to ''The Politics'', by Aristotle (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 1984): 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt; He left Athens approximately twenty years later to study [[botany]] and [[zoology]], became a tutor of [[Alexander the Great]], and ultimately returned to Athens a decade later to establish his own school: the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]].&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]], ''A History of Western Philosophy'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;  At least twenty-nine of his treatises have survived, known as the ''[[corpus Aristotelicum]]'', and address a variety of subjects including [[logic]], [[physics]], [[optics]], [[metaphysics]], [[ethics]], [[rhetoric]], [[politics]], [[poetry]], botany, and zoology.

Aristotle is often portrayed as disagreeing with his teacher Plato (e.g., in [[Raphael]]'s [[School of Athens]]). He criticizes the [[regime]]s described in Plato's [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] and [[Laws (dialogue)|''Laws'']],&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], bk. 2, ch. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the [[theory of forms]] as "empty words and poetic metaphors."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'']], 991a20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; He is generally presented as giving greater weight to empirical observation and practical concerns.

Aristotle's fame was not great during the [[Hellenistic period]], when [[Stoicism|Stoic]] logic was in vogue, but later [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] commentators popularized his work, which eventually contributed heavily to Islamic, Jewish, and medieval Christian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Smith, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-logic/ Aristotle's Logic]," ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  His influence was such that [[Avicenna]] referred to him simply as "the Master"; [[Maimonides]], [[Alfarabi]], [[Averroes]], and [[Aquinas]] as "the Philosopher."

During the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] periods, many different schools of thought developed in the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic world]] and then the [[Greco-Roman]] world. There were [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[History of Syria|Syrians]] and [[Arab]]s who contributed to the development of Hellenistic philosophy. Elements of [[Iranian philosophy|Persian philosophy]] and [[Indian philosophy]] also had an influence. The most notable schools of Hellenistic philosophy were:

* [[Neoplatonism]]: [[Plotinus]] (Egyptian), [[Ammonius Saccas]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (Syrian), [[Disciples of Plotinus|Zethos]] (Arab), [[Iamblichus of Chalcis|Iamblichus]] (Syrian), [[Proclus]]
* [[Philosophical skepticism|Academic Skepticism]]: [[Arcesilaus]], [[Carneades]], [[Cicero]] (Roman)
* [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian Skepticism]]: [[Pyrrho]], [[Sextus Empiricus]]
* [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]]: [[Antisthenes]], [[Diogenes of Sinope]], [[Crates of Thebes]] (taught Zeno of Citium, founder of Stoicism)
* [[Stoicism]]: [[Zeno of Citium]], [[Cleanthes]], [[Chrysippus]], [[Crates of Mallus]] (brought Stoicism to Rome c. 170 BCE), [[Panaetius]], [[Posidonius]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (Roman), [[Epictetus]] (Greek/Roman), [[Marcus Aurelius]] (Roman)
* [[Epicureanism]]: [[Epicurus]] (Greek) and [[Lucretius]] (Roman)
* [[Eclecticism]]: [[Cicero]] (Roman)

The spread of [[Christianity]] throughout the Roman world, followed by the [[spread of Islam]], ushered in the end of Hellenistic philosophy and the beginnings of [[Medieval philosophy]], which was dominated by the three [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] traditions: [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Christian philosophy]], and [[early Islamic philosophy]].

== Transmission of Greek philosophy under Byzantium and Islam ==
{{Main article|Arab transmission of the Classics to the West}}
{{See also|Early Islamic philosophy|Latin translations of the 12th century}}
During the [[Middle Ages]], Greek ideas were largely forgotten in Western Europe due to the [[Migration Period]], which resulted into decline in [[literacy]]. In the [[Byzantine Empire]] Greek ideas were preserved and studied, and not long after the first major expansion of [[Islam]], however, the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]]s authorized the gathering of Greek manuscripts and hired translators to increase their prestige. [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] such as [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius), Ibn Sina ([[Avicenna]]) and Ibn Rushd ([[Averroes]]) reinterpreted these works, and during the [[High Middle Ages]] Greek philosophy re-entered the West through [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translations from Arabic to Latin]] and also from the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dPUBAkIm2lUC&amp;pg=PA162 p. 162].&lt;/ref&gt; The re-introduction of these philosophies, accompanied by the new Arabic commentaries, had a great influence on [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval philosophers]] such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Although we are fortunate to have some figures who preserved these valuable texts, the general trend in Islam was to dispose of books that conflicted with the teachings of Mohammad. This can be seen in events such as the burning of the Al-hakam II library in Córdoba by Al-Mansur Ibn and Abi Aamir in 976.

'''Axiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἀξία|ἀξία]]}}, ''axia'', "value, worth"; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] study of [[value (ethics)|value]]. It is either the collective term for [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/axiology ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'' Entry on Axiology.]&lt;/ref&gt;, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to [[value theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]. The term was first used by Paul Lapie, in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapie|first=Paul|title=Logique de la volonté|year=1902|publisher=F. Alcan|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infotaste.com/axiology-and-aesthetics/|title=Axiology and aesthetics - article|website=www.infotaste.com|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eduard von Hartmann]], in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Hartmann|first=Eduard|title=Grundriss der Axiologie|year=1908|publisher=Hermann Haacke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel L. Hart. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2105883 Axiology—Theory of Values]. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Axiology studies mainly two kinds of values: [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]. Ethics investigates the concepts of "right" and "good" in individual and social conduct. Aesthetics studies the concepts of "beauty" and "harmony." '''Formal axiology,''' the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with [[mathematical rigor]], is exemplified by [[Robert S. Hartman]]'s [[science of value]].

==History==
Between the 5th and 6th century BC, it was important in Greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. Philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. [[Socrates]] believed that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. [[Socrates]]' student, [[Plato]] furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all. With the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped Christianity. During the medieval period, [[Thomas Aquinas]] made the distinction between natural and supernatural (theological) virtues. This concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated70"&gt;Arneson, P. (2009). Axiology. In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of communication theory. (pp. 70-74). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|upright|thumb|The eight-spoked [[dharmachakra]]. The eight spokes represent the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] of Buddhism.]]

'''Buddhist symbolism''' is the method of [[Buddhist art]] to represent certain aspects of [[dharma]], which began in the fourth century BCE. [[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphic]] symbolism appeared from around the first century CE with the arts of [[Mathura]] the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], and were combined with the previous symbols. Various symbolic innovations were later introduced, especially through [Tibetan Buddhism]

==Early symbols==
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|upright|thumb|[[Buddha footprint]]. First century, [[Gandhara]], with depictions of the [[triratna]] and the [[Dharmachakra]].]]
It is not known what the role of the image was in Early Buddhism, although many surviving images can be found, because their symbolic or representative nature was not clearly explained in early texts. Among the earliest and most common symbols of [[Buddhism]] are the [[stupa]] (and the relics therein), the [[Dharmachakra]] or [[Dharma]] wheel, the [[Bodhi Tree]] (and the distinctively shaped leaves of this tree) and the [[padma (attribute)|lotus flower]]. The dharma wheel, traditionally represented with eight spokes, can have a variety of meanings. It initially only meant royalty ([[Chakravartin]], "Turner of the Wheel"), but it began to be used in a Buddhist context on the [[Pillars of Ashoka]] during the 3rd century BC. The Dharma wheel is generally seen as referring to the historical process of teaching Buddhism, the eight spokes referring to the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. The lotus, as well, can have several meanings, often referring to the quality of compassion and subsequently to the related notion of the inherently pure potential of the [[mind]]. The Bodhi Tree represents the spot where the Buddha reached [[nirvana]] and thus represents liberation.

Other early symbols include the monks begging bowl and the [[trishula]], a symbol used since around the second century BCE, and combining the lotus, the [[vajra]] (diamond) and a symbolization of the [[triratna]] or "three jewels": [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[dharma]], and [[sangha]]. The lion, riderless horse and also deer were also used in early Buddhist iconography. The Buddha's teachings are referred to as the "Lion's Roar" in the [[sutra]]s, indicative of their power and nobility. The riderless horse represents renunciation and the deer represent Buddhist disciples, as the Buddha gave his first sermon at the deer park of [[Varanasi]].

The [[swastika]] was traditionally used in [[India]] by Buddhists and [[Hinduism|Hindus]] to represent good fortune. In [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asia]], the swastika is often used as a general symbol of Buddhism. Swastikas used in this context can either be left or right-facing.

Early Buddhism did not portray the Buddha himself instead using an [[hetoimasia|empty throne]] and the Bodhi Tree to represent the Buddha and thus [[aniconism in Buddhism|may have leaned towards aniconism]]. The first hint of a human representation in Buddhist symbolism appear with the [[Buddha footprint]] and full representations were influenced by [[Greco-Buddhist art]].

==Theravada symbolism==
{{main|Cetiya}}

In [[Theravada]], Buddhist art stayed strictly in the realm of representational and historic meaning. Reminders of the Buddha, ''[[cetiya]]'', were divided up into relic, spatial, and representational memorials.

Although the Buddha was not represented in human form until around the first century, the [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]] are described in one of the central texts of the traditional [[Pāli Canon]], the [[Digha Nikaya|''Dīgha Nikāya'']], in the discourse titled "Sutra of the Marks" (Pali: ''Lakkhaṇa Sutta'', D.iii.142ff.).

These characteristics comprise 32 signs, "The 32 signs of a Great Man" (Pali: ''Lakkhaṇa Mahāpurisa 32''), and were supplemented by another eighty secondary characteristics (Pali: ''anubyañjana'').

==Mahayana symbolism==
[[File:Lotus flower on brass bell.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Padma (attribute)|Lotus flower]] on a [[bonshō|temple bell]]. The lotus represents purity of the body, speech, and mind as if floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire.]]
{{main|Ashtamangala}}
[[File:Ashtamangala.jpg|thumb|250px|Mahayana symbols: [[ashtamangala|aṣṭamaṅgala]]]]
In the [[Mahayana]] schools, Buddhist figures and sacred objects leaned towards esoteric and symbolic meaning. [[Mudra]]s are a series of symbolic hand gestures describing the actions of the characters represented in only the most interesting [[Buddhist art]]. Many images also function as [[mandala]]s.

Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhist art frequently makes use of a particular set of "eight auspicious symbols" ([[Sanskrit]] ''[[ashtamangala|aṣṭamaṅgala]]'', {{zh|p=Bā jíxiáng|c=八吉祥}}), in domestic and public art. These symbols have spread with Buddhism to the art of many cultures, including Indian, Tibetan, Nepalese, and [[Chinese art]].

These symbols are:

# [[Padma (attribute)|Lotus flower]]. Representing purity and enlightenment.
# [[Endless knot]], or, the [[mandala]]. Representing eternal harmony.
#  [[Goldfish|goldenfish]]. Representing conjugal happiness and freedom.
# [[Dhvaja|Victory banner]]. Representing a victorious battle.
# [[Dharmachakra|Wheel of the Dharma]]. Representing knowledge.
# [[Bumpa|Treasure vase]]. Representing inexhaustible treasure and wealth.
# [[Chatra (umbrella)|Parasol]]. Representing the crown, and protection from the elements.
# [[Shankha|Conch shell]]. Representing the thoughts of the Buddha.

In [[East Asian Buddhism]], the [[swastika]] is a widely used symbol of eternity. It is used to mark Buddhist temples on maps and in the beginning of [[Buddhist texts]]. It is known in [[Classical Tibetan]] as ''yungdrung'' ({{bo|w=g.Yung drung}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earlytibet.com/2008/04/30/buddhism-and-bon-iii-what-is-yungdrung|title=what-is-yungdrung|accessdate=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ancient Tibet, it was a graphical representation of eternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonfuturefund.org/wp/about-the-bon|title=About the Bon|access-date=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Zen]], a widely used symbol is the [[ensō]], a hand-drawn circle.

==Vajrayana Iconography==
=== Tibetan Buddhist architecture ===
[[File:Eight great stupas.svg|thumb|Eight types of Tibetan stupas]]
[[File:Bhutan emblem.svg|thumb|200px|A ''viśvavajra'' or "double vajra" appears in the emblem of [[Bhutan]]]]
A central [[Vajrayana]] symbol is the [[vajra]], a sacred indestructible weapon of the god Indra, associated with lightning and the hardness of diamonds. It symbolizes emptiness ([[śūnyatā]]) and therefore indestructible nature of reality.

Other Vajrayana symbols include the [[ghanta]] (ritual bell), the [[bhavacakra]], [[mandala]]s, the number 108 and the Buddha eyes commonly seen on Nepalese stupas such as at [[Boudhanath]]. There are various mythical creatures used in [[Vajrayana]] as well: [[Snow Lion]], [[Wind Horse]], [[dragon]], [[garuda]] and tiger.

The popular [[mantra]] "[[om mani padme hum]]" is widely used to symbolize compassion and is commonly seen inscribed on rocks, prayer wheels, stupas and art.

Tibetan Buddhist architecture is centered on the [[stupa]], called in Tibetan {{bo|w=mchod rten|s=chörten}}. The chörten consists of five parts that represent the [[Mahābhūta]] (five elements). The base is square which represents the earth element, above that sits a dome representing water, on that is a cone representing fire, on the tip of the cone is a crescent representing air, inside the crescent is a flame representing ether. The tapering of the flame to a point can also be said to represent consciousness as a sixth element. The chörten presents these elements of the body in the order of the process of dissolution at death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism|last = Sangharakshita|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetan temples are often three-storied. The three can represent many aspects such as the [[Trikaya]] (three aspects) of a buddha. The ground story may have a statue of the historical buddha Gautama and depictions of Earth and so represent the nirmāṇakāya. The first story may have Buddha and elaborate ornamentation representing rising above the human condition and the sambhogakāya. The second story may have a primordial [[Adi-Buddha]] in [[Yab-Yum]] (sexual union with his female counterpart) and be otherwise unadorned representing a return to the absolute reality and the [[dharmakāya]] "truth body".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The five colours (Sanskrit ''pañcavarṇa'' - white, green, yellow, blue, red) are supplemented by several other colours including black and orange and gold (which is commonly associated with yellow). They are commonly used for [[prayer flag]]s as well as for visualising deities and spiritual energy, construction of mandalas and the painting of religions icons.

=== Thangkas (paintings) and statues of buddhas and deities ===
Tibetan Buddhist deities may often assume different roles and be drawn, sculpted and visualised differently according to these roles, for example, Green Tara and White Tara which are but two of many different aspects of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]].

Aside from these vivid colours, figures may also be coloured more naturalistically such as skin in shades of pink or brown. Gold colored leaf and gold paint are also common. These colours help distinguish many deities that are less easily distinguished in other branches of Buddhism. For instance while Shakyamuni Buddha may be seen in (pale) yellow or orange and Amitabha Buddha is typically red in Vajrayana thangkas, in Chinese Buddhism it is often only the hand pose that distinguishes the two who are otherwise drawn with the same attributes.

Depictions of "wrathful deities" are often depicted very fearsomely, crushing their foes, with monstrous visages and wearing ''[[memento mori]]'' in the form of skulls or bodily parts. Such deities are depicted in this way as sometimes great wrath is required to overcome great ignorance and [[adharma]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As is common in Buddhism, the lotus is used in Vajrayana. A lotus may appear fully blossomed, starting to open or still a bud to represent the teachings that have gone, are current or are yet to come.

[[Avalokiteśvara]] is often depicted with one thousand (or, at least, many) arms to represent the many methods he uses to help all sentient beings and often has eleven heads to symbolise his compassion is directed to all sentient beings.

Vajrayana Buddhism often specifies the number of feet of a buddha or bodhisattva. While two is common there may also be ten, sixteen, or twenty-four feet. The position of the feet/legs may also have a specific meaning such as in Green Tara who is typically depicted as seated partly cross-legged but with one leg down symbolising "immersion within in the absolute, in meditation" and readiness to step forth and help sentient beings by "engagement without in the world through compassion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

= Symbolic Physical Attributes of Buddhism =

=== Robes in different sects Symbolism ===
Buddhism has other symbolism that are physical and needed for ritual such as their robes. The robes for example in the sect of Theravada are noticeably different than the robes of the other sects of Buddhism. Since Theravada is the orthodox or the oldest of the three sects, they have a different traditional layout of their Theravada robes. They carry their robes over their shoulders, most often showing their arm and the color their sect represents. Theravada, for example is [[Saffron (color)|Saffron]], while other sects of Buddhism (and in different countries) will have it as a different color as well as different styles or ways on how they wear it. Once Buddhism spread throughout China back in sixth century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://asiasociety.org/buddhism-china|title=Buddhism in China|work=Asia Society|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was seen wrong to show that much skin, and that's when robes to cover both arms with long sleeves came in to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-buddhas-robe-450083|title=Get an Overview of the Robes Worn by Buddhist Monks and Nuns|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of China such as Tibet, have changed over time and they show both their shoulders as well as having a two piece attire rather than one. Shortly thereafter, Japan integrated a bib along with their long sleeve robe called a ''[[koromo]]''{{disambiguation needed|date=November 2018}}. This was a clothing piece made specifically for their school of Zen which they practice in [[Takuhatsu|T''akahatsu'']] that involves the monks of Japan wearing a straw hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-buddhas-robe-p2-4123187|title=Buddhist Monks' Robes: An Illustrated Guide|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ritual Bell Symbolism ===
In all sects of Buddhism, there is a ringing of a bell where a Buddhist monk rings the large bronze bell signifying the start of the evening rituals. There are different names of each and every bell but some examples include The Tzar Bell and The Bell of Good Luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.cornell.edu/aitmw2014/2014/08/06/713/|title=Buddhist Bells and Statues – Presentation  {{!}} Art in the Modern World 2014|website=blogs.cornell.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They use the bell to detain away the bad spirits and have the Buddha protect them at the time of their ritual. Some sects call this a part of the "[[Mystic Law]]" which is the beginning of a Buddhist ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://classroom.synonym.com/meaning-burning-incense-ringing-bells-buddhism-8388.html|title=The Meaning of Burning Incense and Ringing Bells in Buddhism {{!}} Synonym|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bald Monastics Symbolism ===
Shaving ones head is another act of ritual for which you need to complete before being a part of Monastic Buddhism to ultimately reach nirvana. To shave ones head merely signifies ones readiness into this sect of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chomonhouse.org/service/whydobuddhists.htm|title=Why do Buddhists Shave their Heads?|website=www.chomonhouse.org|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mention of the symbolism of one shaving their hair is simply that it is one of the rules the Buddha gave to his disciples to be kept away from ordinary life and be fully involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mahamevnawabm.org/why-do-buddhist-monks-and-nuns-shave-their-heads/|title=Why do Buddhist monks and nuns shave their heads? - Mahamevnawa Buddhist Monastery|date=2018-04-20|work=Mahamevnawa Buddhist Monastery|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prayer Position Symbolism ===
Another form of symbolism of the Buddhist is the joining of your hands together at prayer or at the time of the ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nstmyosenji.org/traditions/buddhists-join-their-hands-in-prayer|title=Why Buddhists Join Their Hands in Prayer {{!}} Myosenji Buddhist Temple|website=nstmyosenji.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist compare their fingers with the petals of the lotus flower. Bowing down is another form of symbolic position in the act of the ritual, when Buddhist bow in front of the Buddha or to another person they aren't bowing at the physical (the human or the statue) but they are bowing at the Buddha inside of them (the human) or it (the statue).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=본엄|title=Why Do Buddhists Bow to Buddhas?|date=2015-06-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHbB1WRVKkw|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Pan-Buddhist symbolism==
[[File:Flag of Buddhism.svg|thumb|200px|[[Buddhist flag]]]]
At its founding in 1952, the [[World Fellowship of Buddhists]] adopted two symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Freiberger, Oliver |url=http://www.mandala.hr/5/relations.html |title=The Meeting of Traditions: Inter-Buddhist and Inter-Religious Relations in the West |accessdate=2004-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040626064000/http://www.mandala.hr/5/relations.html |archivedate=2004-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were a traditional eight-spoked [[Dharmacakra|Dharma wheel]] and the [[Buddhist flag|five-colored flag]] which had been designed in [[Sri Lanka]] in the 1880s with the assistance of [[Henry Steel Olcott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2003/06/04/fea06.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040923055530/http://www.dailynews.lk/2003/06/04/fea06.html |archivedate=2004-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six vertical bands of the flag represent the six colors of the [[aura (paranormal)|aura]] which Buddhists believe emanated from the body of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] when he attained [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Buddhist Flag|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/b_flag.htm|publisher=Buddhanet|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="queensland"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Origin and Meaning of the Buddhist Flag|url=http://buddhistcouncilofqueensland.org/node/143|publisher=The Buddhist Council of Queensland|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlos Astrada''' (February 26, 1894 – December 23, 1970) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] philosopher.

Astrada was born in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]]. He completed his secondary school studies at the [[Colegio Nacional de Monserrat]] in Córdoba, and his university studies in law at the [[National University of Córdoba]]. His 1926 essay "The Epistemological Problem in Philosophy", earned an Astrada scholarship to [[Germany]]. He studied at the Universities of [[Cologne]], [[Bonn]], and [[Freiburg]], under [[Max Scheler]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Oskar Becker]] during his four years there.

When he returned to Argentina from [[Germany]], Astrada was designated the head of Publications and Conferences in the Social Institute of the [[University of Litoral]] (1933-1934). There he began a vast career in distinct academic functions of the country: he was an adjunct professor of The History of Modern and Contemporary [[Philosophy]] in the School of Philosophy and Letter in the [[University of Buenos Aires]] (1936-1947); Professor of Ethics in the School of Science and Humanities in Education at the [[University of La Plata]] in [[La Plata]] (1937-1947); Professor of Philosophy in the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires]] (1939-1949); Professor of Nomology and Metaphysics in the School of Philosophy and Letters in the [[University of Buenos Aires]] (1947-1956); Director of the Institute of Philosophy in the University of Buenos Aires (1948-1956), and other posts. Astrada died in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1970.

'''Community genetics''' is a recently emerged field in biology that fuses elements of [[community ecology]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[molecular genetics|molecular]] and [[quantitative genetics]].

The documentary movie ''A Thousand Invisible Cords''&lt;ref name=Thousand&gt;{{cite web|author=Nau Idea Lab |url=http://athousandinvisiblecords.org/ |title=Home &amp;#124; A Thousand Invisible Cords &amp;#124; Connecting Genes to Ecosystems |publisher=A Thousand Invisible Cords |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an introduction to the field and its implications.
	
To date, the primary focus of most community genetics studies has been on the influences of genetic variation in plants on foliar arthropod communities. In a wide variety of ecosystems, different plant genotypes often support different compositions of associated foliar arthropod communities.&lt;ref name=Whitham2&gt;Whitham, T.G., C.A. Gehring, L.J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6651">'''Condensed detachment''' (Rule D) is a method of finding the most general possible conclusion given two formal logical statements.
It was developed by the Irish [[logician]] [[Carew Meredith]] in the 1950s and inspired by the work of [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]].&lt;ref name="Kalman1983"/&gt;

==Informal description==

A rule of detachment (often referred to as [[modus ponens]]) says:&lt;br&gt;
"Given that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, and given &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, infer &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;."

The condensed detachment goes a step further and says:&lt;br&gt;
"Given that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, and given an &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, use a [[unification (computer science)#Syntactic unification of first-order terms|unifier]] of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to make &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the same, then use a standard rule of detachment."

A [[substitution (logic)|substitution]] ''A'' that when applied to &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; produces &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and substitution ''B'' that when applied to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; produces &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, are called unifiers of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

Various unifiers may produce expressions with varying numbers of [[free variable]]s.  Some possible unifying expressions are [[substitution instance]]s of others.  If one expression is a substitution instance of another (and not just a variable renaming), then that other is called "more general".

If the most general unifier is used in condensed detachment, then the logical result is the most general conclusion that can be made in the given inference with the given second expression. Since any weaker inference you can get is a substitution instance of the most general one, nothing less than the most general unifier is ever used in practice.

Some logics, such as classical [[propositional calculus]], have a set of defining axioms with the "D-completeness" property. If a set of axioms is D-Complete, then any valid theorem of the system, including all of its substitution instances (up to variable renaming), can be generated by condensed detachment alone.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;p \rightarrow p&lt;/math&gt; is a theorem of a D-complete system, condensed detachment can prove not only that theorem but also its substitution instance &lt;math&gt;( p \rightarrow p ) \rightarrow ( p \rightarrow p )&lt;/math&gt; by using a longer proof.  Note that "D-completeness" is a property of an axiomatic basis for a system, not an intrinsic property of a logic system itself.&lt;ref name="MegillBunder1996"&gt;{{cite journal | author=N. Megill and M. Bunder | title=Weaker D-Complete Logics | journal=[[J. IGPL]] | volume=4 | number=2 | pages=215&amp;mdash;225 | date=Mar 1996 | doi=10.1093/jigpal/4.2.215 | url = http://us.metamath.org/downloads/weakd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. A. Kalman proved that any conclusion that can be generated by  a sequence of uniform substitution (all instances of a variable are replaced with the same content) and ''[[modus ponens]]'' steps can either be generated by condensed detachment alone, or is a substitution instance of something that can be generated by condensed detachment alone.&lt;ref name="Kalman1983"&gt;{{cite journal | author=J.A. Kalman | title=Condensed Detachment as a Rule of Inference | journal=[[Studia Logica]] | volume=42 | number=4 | pages=443&amp;mdash;451 | date=Dec 1983 | doi=10.1007/BF01371632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This makes condensed detachment useful for any logic system that has ''[[modus ponens]]'' and substitution, regardless of whether or not it is D-complete.

==D-notation==
Since a given major premise and a given minor premise uniquely determine the conclusion (up to variable renaming), [[Carew Meredith|Meredith]] observed that it was only necessary to note which two statements were involved and that the condensed detachment can be used without any other notation required. This led to the "D-notation" for [[Mathematical proof|proofs]].  This notation uses the "D" operator to mean condensed detachment, and takes 2 arguments, in a standard [[prefix notation]] string. For example, if you have four axioms a typical proof in D-notation might look like:  DD12D34  which shows a condensed detachment step using the result of two prior condensed detachment steps, the first of which used axioms 1 and 2, and the second of which used axioms 3 and 4.

This notation, besides being used in some automated theorem provers, sometimes appears in catalogs of proofs.

Condensed detachment's use of unification predates the [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]] techniques of [[automated theorem proving]].{{cn|reason=There is no reference given that dates before 1965, when Robinson introduced unification to resolution proving.|date=December 2014}}

==Advantages==

For automated theorem proving condensed detachment has a number of advantages over raw ''[[modus ponens]]'' and uniform substitution.

At a Modus Ponens and substitution proof you have an infinite number of choices for what you can substitute for variables. This means that you have an infinite number of possible next steps.  With condensed detachment there are only a finite number of possible next steps in a proof.{{clarify|reason=A similar improvement resulted from Robinson's 1965 introduction of unification in resolution proving, in particular from his lifting lemma. Condensed detachment should better be compared to that approach, rather than to the pre-1965 british-museum approach. (We should also find out whether Robinson was aware of Meredith. He doesn't cite him in his paper 'A Machine-Oriented Logic Based on the Resolution Principle'.)|date=December 2014}}

The D-notation for complete condensed detachment proofs allows easy description of proofs for cataloging and search.  A typical complete 30 step proof is less than 60 characters long in D-notation (excluding the statement of the axioms.)

'''Confidentiality''' involves a set of rules or a promise usually executed through [[Non-disclosure agreement|confidentiality agreements]] that limits access or places restrictions on certain types of [[information]].

==Legal confidentiality==
{{main|Privacy law}}

Lawyers are often required by law to keep confidential anything pertaining to the representation of a client. The duty of confidentiality is much broader than the [[attorney–client privilege|attorney–client evidentiary privilege]], which only covers ''communications'' between the attorney and the client.

Both the privilege and the duty serve the purpose of encouraging clients to speak frankly about their cases. This way, lawyers can carry out their duty to provide clients with zealous representation. Otherwise, the opposing side may be able to surprise the lawyer in court with something he did not know about his client, which may weaken the client's position. Also, a distrustful client might hide a relevant fact he thinks is incriminating, but that a skilled lawyer could turn to the client's advantage (for example, by raising [[affirmative defense]]s like self-defense)

However, most jurisdictions have exceptions for situations where the lawyer has reason to believe that the client may kill or seriously injure someone, may cause substantial injury to the financial interest or property of another, or is using (or seeking to use) the lawyer's services to perpetrate a crime or fraud.

In such situations the lawyer has the discretion, but not the obligation, to disclose information designed to prevent the planned action. Most states have a version of this discretionary disclosure rule under Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6 (or its equivalent).

A few jurisdictions have made this traditionally discretionary duty mandatory. For example, see the New Jersey and Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6.

In some jurisdictions the lawyer must try to convince the client to conform his or her conduct to the boundaries of the law before disclosing any otherwise confidential information.

Note that these exceptions generally do not cover crimes that have already occurred, even in extreme cases where murderers have confessed the location of missing bodies to their lawyers but the police are still looking for those bodies. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] and many [[state supreme court]]s have affirmed the right of a lawyer to withhold information in such situations. Otherwise, it would be impossible for any criminal defendant to obtain a zealous defense.

California is famous for having one of the strongest duties of confidentiality in the world; its lawyers must protect client confidences at "every peril to himself [or herself]" under former California Business and Professions Code section 6068(e).  Until an amendment in 2004 (which turned subsection (e) into subsection (e)(1) and added subsection (e)(2) to section 6068), California lawyers were not even permitted to disclose that a client was about to commit murder or assault.  The Supreme Court of California promptly amended the California Rules of Professional Conduct to conform to the new exception in the revised statute.

Recent legislation in the UK curtails the confidentiality professionals like lawyers and accountants can maintain at the expense of the state.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Accountants, for example, are required to disclose to the state any suspicions of fraudulent accounting and, even, the legitimate use of tax saving schemes if those schemes are not already known to the tax authorities.

===Breach of confidence in English law===
{{main|Breach of confidence in English law}}

The "three traditional requirements of the cause of action for breach of confidence"&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Campbell v MGN Ltd | link = Campbell v MGN Ltd | court = UKHL | year = 2004 | num = 22 | parallelcite = [2004] 2 AC 457}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|[19]}} were identified by [[Robert Megarry|Megarry J]] in ''Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Ltd'' (1968) in the following terms:&lt;ref name="coco"&gt;''Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Ltd'' [1969] RPC 41; [1968] [[Fleet Street Reports: Cases on Intellectual Property Law|FSR]] 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|In my judgment, three elements are normally required if, apart from contract, a case of breach of confidence is to succeed. First, the information itself, in the words of Lord Greene, M.R. in the ''Saltman'' case on page 215, must "have the necessary quality of confidence about it." Secondly, that information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. Thirdly, there must be an unauthorised use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it.}}

The 1896 case featuring the royal ''accoucheur'' Dr [[William Smoult Playfair]] showed the difference between lay and medical views. Playfair was consulted by Linda Kitson; he ascertained that she had been pregnant while separated from her husband. He informed his wife, a relative of Kitson's, in order that she protect herself and their daughters from moral contagion. Kitson sued, and the case gained public notoriety, with huge damages awarded against the doctor. &lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=35541|title=Playfair, William Smoult|first=Ann|last=Dally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical confidentiality==
Confidentiality is commonly applied to conversations between doctors and patients. Legal protections prevent physicians from revealing certain discussions with patients, even under oath in court.&lt;ref name="Coburn's"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/dr-coburns-peculiar-privi_b_308077.html Dr. Coburn's Peculiar Privilege], 2 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This [[physician-patient privilege]] only applies to secrets shared between physician and patient during the course of providing medical care.&lt;ref name="Coburn's"/&gt;

The rule dates back to at least the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which reads:  ''Whatever, in connection with my professional service, or not in connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not to be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as reckoning that all such should be kept secret.''

Traditionally, medical ethics has viewed the duty of confidentiality as a relatively non-negotiable tenet of medical practice.

===United States===
Confidentiality is standard in the United States by [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] laws, specifically the Privacy Rule, and various state laws, some more rigorous than HIPAA. However, numerous exceptions to the rules have been carved out over the years. For example, many American states require physicians to report gunshot wounds to the police and impaired drivers to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Confidentiality is also challenged in cases involving the diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease in a patient who refuses to reveal the diagnosis to a spouse, and in the termination of a pregnancy in an underage patient, without the knowledge of the patient's parents. Many states in the U.S. have laws governing parental notification in underage abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/aborlaws.htm Notification Laws] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429230410/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/aborlaws.htm |date=29 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV confidentiality===
In the United Kingdom information about an individual's HIV status is kept confidential within the NHS. This is based in law, in the NHS Constitution and in key NHS rules and procedures. It is also outlined in every NHS employee’s contract of employment and in professional standards set by regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/healthregulators/Pages/professional-standards-authority.aspx|title=Professional Standards Authority - Home|author=|date=|website=www.nhs.uk|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National AIDS Trust's Confidentiality in the NHS: Your Information, Your Rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nat.org.uk/media/Files/Publications/Confidentiality-July-2014_FINAL-2.pdf|title=Publications - National AIDS Trust - NAT|author=|date=|website=www.nat.org.uk|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines these rights. All registered healthcare professionals must abide by these standards and if they are found to have breached confidentiality, they can face disciplinary action.

A healthcare worker shares confidential information with someone else who is, or is about to, provide the patient directly with healthcare to make sure they get the best possible treatment. They only share information that is relevant to their care in that instance, and with consent.

There are two ways to give consent: ''explicit consent'' or ''implied consent''. Explicit consent is when a patient clearly communicates to a healthcare worker, verbally or in writing or in some other way, that relevant confidential information can be shared. Implied consent, means that a patient's consent to share personal confidential information is assumed. When personal confidential information is shared between healthcare workers, consent is taken as implied.

If a patient doesn't want a healthcare worker to share confidential health information, they need to make this clear and discuss the matter with healthcare staff. Patients have the right, in most situations, to refuse permission for a health care professional to share their information with another healthcare professional, even one giving them care—but are advised, where appropriate, about the dangers of this course of action, due to possible drug interactions.

However, in a few limited instances, a healthcare worker can share personal information without consent if it is in the public interest. These instances are set out in guidance from the General Medical Council,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/confidentiality.asp|title=GMC - Confidentiality|work=gmc-uk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the regulatory body for doctors. Sometimes the healthcare worker has to provide the information - if required by law or in response to a court order.

The [[National AIDS Trust]] has written a guide for people living with HIV to confidentiality in the NHS.&lt;ref&gt;http://nat.org.uk/media/Files/Publications/Confidentiality-July-2014_FINAL-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical and counseling psychology==
The ethical principle of confidentiality requires that information shared by a client with a [[therapist]] in the course of treatment is not shared with others. This principle bolsters the [[therapeutic alliance]], as it promotes an environment of trust. There are important exceptions to confidentiality, namely where it conflicts with the clinician's [[duty to warn]] or [[duty to protect]]. This includes instances of [[suicidal behavior]] or [[homicidal]] plans, [[child abuse]], [[elder abuse]] and [[dependent adult abuse]].  Recently,{{when|date=October 2015}} confidentiality laws have been changed{{by whom|date=October 2015}} so that doctors and nurses face strict penalties if they breach confidentiality.

On 26 June 2012 a judge of [[Oslo District Court]] apologized for the court's hearing of testimony (on 14 June, regarding contact with [[Child Welfare Services (Norway)]]) that was covered by confidentiality (that had not been waived at that point of the [[trial of Anders Behring Breivik]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/22juli/Tingretten-ber-Behring-Breiviks-mor-om-unnskyldning-6912500.html|title= Tingretten ber Behring Breiviks mor om unnskyldning|author= Per Anders Johansen|work= Aftenposten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial confidentiality ==
Some legal jurisdictions recognise a category of commercial confidentiality whereby a [[business]] may withhold information on the basis of perceived harm to "[[commercial interest]]s".&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite book
| last1                 = Paradissis
| first1                = Jean-Jacques
| last2                 = Purdue
| first2                = Michael

| volume                = 11

| publication-date      = 2007
| page                  = 293
| isbn                  = 9789004157835
| accessdate            = 2015-10-20
| quote                 = Commercial confidentiality is usually defined by reference to commercial interests of the person concerned: if disclosure can 'prejudice to an unreasonable degree' commercial interests, then it must not be permitted. 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For example: Soft drink giant [[Coca-Cola]]'s main syrup formula remains a trade-secret.

== Banking confidentiality ==
{{Main|bank–client confidentiality}}

== Public policy concerns ==
Confidentiality agreements that "seal" [[Settlement (litigation)|litigation settlements]] are not uncommon, but this can leave regulators and society ignorant of public hazards. In the U.S. state of Washington, for example, journalists discovered that about two dozen medical malpractice cases had been improperly sealed by judges, leading to improperly weak discipline by the state Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/special-reports/what-the-state-didnt-know-about-doctor-malpractice-suit/|title=What the state didn't know about doctor, malpractice suit|date=2006-12-13|website=The Seattle Times|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and early 2000s, the [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|Catholic sexual abuse scandal]] involved a number of confidentiality agreements with victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/27/nyregion/albany-diocese-settled-abuse-case-for-almost-1-million.html|title=Albany Diocese Settled Abuse Case for Almost $1 Million|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|date=2002-06-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states have passed laws that limit confidentiality. For example, in 1990 Florida passed a 'Sunshine in Litigation' law that limits confidentiality from concealing public hazards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/gp_solo/2012/november_december2012privacyandconfidentiality/confidentiality_settlement_agreements_is_bad_clients_lawyers_justice.html|title=Confidentiality in Settlement Agreements Is Bad for Clients, Bad for Lawyers, Bad for Justice|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington state, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana have laws limiting confidentiality as well, although judicial interpretation has weakened the application of these types of laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol154/iss2/4/|title="Quality, Not Quantity: An Analysis of Confidential Settlements and Lit" by Alison Lothes|website=scholarship.law.upenn.edu|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. Congress, a similar federal Sunshine in Litigation Act has been proposed but not passed in 2009, 2011, 2014, and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fan|first=Mary D.|date=2015-09-18|title=Private Data, Public Safety: A Bounded Access Model of Disclosure|ssrn=2662678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand Japanese|date=January 2010|大日本史}}
The '''''Dai Nihonshi''''' (大日本史), literally '''''Great History of Japan''''', is a book on the [[history of Japan]].  It was begun in the 17th century, during the [[Edo period]], by [[Tokugawa Mitsukuni]], the head of the [[Mito branch]] of the [[Tokugawa family]]. After his death, work was continued by the [[Mito branch]] until its completion in the [[Meiji era]]. The work starts with [[Emperor Jimmu]], the legendary first emperor of Japan, during the early [[Kofun period]], and covers the first hundred emperors, ending with [[Emperor Go-Komatsu]] after the merging of the Southern and [[Northern Court]] in 1392. The whole work comprises 397 scrolls in 226 volumes, and 5 scrolls of index.

The book is one of the major scholarly works of the Edo period, and laid the foundation of the [[Mitogaku|Mito school]] and [[Kokugaku]]. [[Aizawa Seishisai]] worked on it. It is heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]], especially the later [[Neo-Confucianism]] under [[Zhu Xi]].  However, instead of focusing on the Chinese classics like other Confucian schools, it centered on the Japanese classics and Japan as a land ruled by the ''tennō'' (尊王論 ''sonnōron''). This school of thought led to the [[Sonnō jōi]] movement, and eventually the [[Mito Rebellion]] against the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] during the [[Bakumatsu]] period.

[[Image:Kids board edusim.png|thumb|250px|'''Edusim on an interactive whiteboard''' Students at the Greenbush Southeast Kansas Education Service Center editing and interacting with 3D dinosaur models on their classroom interactive whiteboard]]

'''Edusim''' is a [[cave automatic virtual environment]] "Immersive Touch" [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[natural user interface]] (NUI)-based concept of lesson driven (multi-user) 3D virtual worlds on the classroom interactive whiteboard or classroom interactive surface.  The Edusim concept is demonstrated by the Edusim ''free and [[open-source software|open-source]]'' multi-user [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Open Cobalt]] virtual world platform and authoring tool kit modified for the classroom [[interactive whiteboard]] or surface. The Edusim application is a modified edition of the open source Open Cobalt Project and relies heavily on the affordances of [[direct manipulation]] of 3D virtual learning models and [[constructionist learning]] principles.

== Goals ==
The goal of the Edusim project is to provide an example platform, and initial resources for demonstrating the use of lesson driven [[Virtual reality|3D virtual environments]] in the classroom or for training purposes using interactive surfaces and/or whiteboards as the hardware platform for the "immersive touch" 3D NUI direct manipulation of the 3D learning content. For example, students are able to play with 3D renderings of dinosaur fossils and study the flight of birds from every angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |isbn=978-1593157203 |page=177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Edusim project originated and the term "immersive touch" 3D natural user interface was coined in September 2007 at the Greenbush Education Service Center in Southeast [[Kansas]] as an effort to bring an engaging 3D experience to the classroom interactive whiteboard.  Pilot groups were established with 6th and 7th grade middle school students throughout Southeast Kansas to observe how students would engage with the software, and how the user interface would need to be augmented to account for the affordances of the interactive whiteboard, and the usability of the students.

== Immersive Touch ==
'''Immersive Touch''' natural user interface is defined as the direct manipulation of 3D virtual environment objects using single or multi-touch surface hardware in multi-user 3D virtual environments.  Coined first to describe and define the natural user interface learning principles associated with Edusim.  Immersive Touch natural user interface now appears to be taking on a broader focus and meaning with the broader adaption of surface and touch driven hardware such as the iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and a growing list of other hardware.

== Emerging and potential immersive touch environments ==
*[[Smartboard]] 3D Tools: Smartech deployed the first commercial Edusim UI in their 3D Tools product.
*[[Google Earth]] on a collaborative interactive surface.

'''Egalitarian communities''' are groups of people who have chosen to live together, with [[egalitarianism]] as one of their core values. A broad definition of egalitarianism is "equal access to resources and to decision-making power." For example, decision-making is done by [[consensus decision-making|consensus]] or another system in which each person has a voice; it is not done hierarchically with only one or a few people making choices that will affect the whole group. If the group shares assets (income, vehicles, etc.), they are distributed equitably throughout the group, and each member has access to more-or-less the same resources as any other member. Egalitarian communities are a type of [[commune]] (some communal groups are not egalitarian in nature).

An "egalitarian decision" is a decision made by a group as opposed to a single individual. The decision may be made by committee or elected members but still is an egalitarian decision.

The [[Federation of Egalitarian Communities]] is a network of communal groups in North America with values including egalitarianism, [[non-violence]], income-sharing and [[cooperation]].

'''Emanuilo Janković''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Емануило Јанковић}}{{Cref2|a}}; 1758–1792) was a Serbian writer, dramatist, philosopher, translator, editor and scientist. He was not only a language reformer but also an innovator in the use of Serbian Cyrillic [[Grapheme]]s. Also, his research and studies of the detailed chemistry, mineralogy, and isotopic compositions of [[meteorites]] provide invaluable clues to the range of chemical and physical processing and timing of events in the solar nebula.

==Life==
Janković was born in 1758 to a Serbian family in [[Novi Sad|Ratzen Stadt (modern Novi Sad)]], then part of the [[Military Frontier]] of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (now [[Serbia]]).

In 1790 he and '''Damjan Kaulić''' both independently petitioned for a Serbian printing house in Novi Sad, but were rejected by the Austrian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serbian Printing|url=http://www.srpskoblago.org/history-of-serbian-culture/serbian-printing.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote the first modern Serbian treatise on hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maksimović |first=Jovan |title=Doprinos lekara iz Vojvodine u uspostavljanju zdravstvene službe u Srbiji i osnivanje i radu lekarskog društva |trans-title=Contribution of physicians from Vojvodina to establishing Health service in Serbia and founding and working of Medical Society of Serbia |year=2008 |url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0025-8105/2008/0025-81050804191M.pdf |publisher=Društvo lekara Vojvodine Srpskog lekarskog društva |language=Serbian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019142819/http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0025-8105/2008/0025-81050804191M.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Emanuilo Janković died in 1792 in [[Subotica]]. [[Ruđer Bošković]], [[Dositej Obradović]] and [[Atanasije Stojković]] were his contemporaries. In his lifetime and after death, Emanuilo Janković was more noted as a philosopher and man of letters than a scientist. But as the years progressed, his early research on meteorites became Meteor Science and his reputation as a scientist was also recognized.

His importance lies in his pioneering work at the period of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in such diverse fields as science, drama and publishing, as well as in the use of the vernacular in literature. Janković was a native of Novi Sad, Banat, and his critics regard him as a rude precursor of Vuk Karadžić, the reformer of Serbian language. He wrote ''"Fiziceskkoe Socinenie"'' (Treatise on Physics).

He made significant and wide-ranging contributions to Serbian cultural life, though little recognition has been accorded to him in Serbia. Unfortunately little is known about his personal life. The information we have is fragmentary and to a great extent is provided by the prologues of his works, his one extant letter of 15 September 1790, and German and Latin copies of other of his letters and those of his contemporaries, now preserved in the Budapest State Archives.

Very early on Emanuilo Janković became aware that in eighteenth century Serbian there was no normalized literary language and orthography, and that learned men often wrote in an idiom that was incomprehensible to the common folk and the uneducated. He read Dositej Obradović and corrspondended with him. Janković knew Dositej's efforts to write in a language that was close to the vernacular and understandable to all. By then, the works of Obradović were being brought to the attention of European scholars, and [[Jernej Kopitar]] was among the first to embrace the efforts of Dositej Obradović and Emanuilo Janković.

Emanuilo Janković was one of the authors who applied phonemic principles with relative consistency in solutions involving individual phonemes or phoneme sequences.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=MZ5iAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=emanuil+jankovic&amp;dq=emanuil+jankovic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4rrPqy-TeAhUkhuAKHTSND-Q4ChDoAQg8MAQ&lt;/ref&gt;

He particularly disliked the use of letters, which stood for a sound non-existent in Serbian, and "space-gobbling" and totally superfluous letters. He read essays by [[Dositej Obradović]] and others on language reforms being done throughout Europe and [[Imperial Russia]]. These essays had been severely criticized by members of the hierarchy of the Serbian Orthodox Church because they proposed to simplify the traditional Slavonic alphabet for secular one, by eliminating letters that were duplicates or stood for sounds not in the Serbian language. The clergy had charged that dropping certain letters would cause the modern orthography to come into "collision" with the Slavonic. Janković defended them, citing Russian spelling that corresponds to Russian speech and not Slavonic. He suggested that Serbs keep the orthography of the church language separate from that of the living language they would use in the new literature.

'''Gaston Berger''' ({{IPA-fr|bɛʁʒe|lang}}; 1 October 1896 – 13 November 1960) was a French [[futurist]] but also an industrialist, a philosopher and a state manager. He is mainly known for his remarkably lucid analysis of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and for his studies on the [[character structure]].

Berger was born in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal]], [[French West Africa]] (now [[Senegal]]). He received his primary and part of his secondary education in Perpignan, France, and had to take up a position in an industrial firm.  After having performed his military duties in World War I, he became an associate of the owner of the firm. Berger decided to continue his studies. He worked with Rene Le Senne and passed his baccalaureat. He then enrolled in the University of Aix-en-Provence, where he studied philosophy under Maurice Blondel. Having passed his licence, he obtained a diploma d’Etudes Superieures with a thesis on the ‘Relations between the conditions of intelligibility on the one hand and the problem of contingency on the other hand’. In 1926 Berger founded with some friends the Societe de Philosophie du Sud-est and its periodical ''{{ill|Les Études philosophiques|fr}}''. In 1938 he organized the first Congress of French Language Societies of Philosophy. In 1941 he submitted his two theses de doctorat d’Etat, the first entitled ‘Investigations on the conditions of Knowledge. Essay of Pure Knowledge’, the second ‘The ‘Cogito’ in Husserl’s philosophy’. Berger then left his industrial firm and became first a 'Chargé de Cours', then a 'Maitre de Conferences' for philosophy at the University of Aix-en Provence. In 1944 he became full professor. In 1949 he became secretary general of the Fulbright Commission, in charge of the cultural relations between France and the United States.

After managing a fertilizer plant during the 1930s, he created in Paris the ''Centre Universitaire International et des Centres de Prospective'' and directed the philosophical studies (Études philosophiques). The term ''prospective'', invented by Gaston Berger, is the study of the possible futures.

From 1953 to 1960 he was in charge of the tertiary education at the [[Minister of National Education (France)|Minister of National Education]] and modernised the French universities system. He was elected at the [[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques]] in 1955.

In 1957 he founded the journal  ''Prospective'' and the homonym centre with André Gros. This same year he created the [[Institut national des sciences appliquées]] (INSA) of Lyon with the rector Capelle.

He was the father of the French choreographer [[Maurice Béjart]] (1927–2007), a stage name for Maurice-Jean Berger. The [[Gaston Berger University|university of Saint-Louis]], Senegal, where he was born is named after him.

'''Grigory Nikolayevich Vyrubov''', or '''Grégoire Wyrouboff''' (Russian: Григорий Николаевич Вырубов; 31 October 1843, Moscow – 30 November 1913, Paris) was a [[Russia]]n [[Positivism|Positivist]] philosopher and historian of science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article007447.html Вырубов Григорий Николаевич]. [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Born in [[Moscow]], Vyrubov was brought up in Italy and France before studying medicine and natural philosophy at the [[University of Moscow]]. Heavily influenced by [[Edmond Nikolayevich Pommier]], Vyrubov founded the Positivist journal ''Philosophie positive'' with [[Emile Littré]] in 1867: he edited the journal until 1881. He befriended [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Herzen]], and edited anonymously the first edition of Herzen's works (10 vols, 1875–79).

In 1896 Vyrubov criticized [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendellev's]] notion and statement of a [[History of the periodic table|periodic law]], i.e., "all the properties of bodies are periodic functions of their [[Standard atomic weight|atomic weights]]," citing the inversion of [[tellurium]] and [[iodine]], which breaks the order of monotonically increasing atomic weights. He went so far as to say "I think that it is time to show clearly that there is nothing [here] which merits the name of law or system." Rethinking periodicity in terms of [[atomic number]] eliminates the problem, and the criticism was beside the point, since the notion of a periodic law had already saturated the field of chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Gordin (2004)  ''A Well-Ordered Thing: Dimitrii Mendeleev and the Shadow of the Periodic Table''. Basic Books, New York. {{ISBN|0-465-02775-X}} citing G. Wyrouboff, "On the Periodic Classification of the Elements" ''Chemical News'' 74 (1896)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he had never trained as a historian of science, in 1903 he was elected as [[Pierre Laffitte]]'s successor to the chair of history of science at the [[Collège de France]], and held the chair until his death.

Vyrubov was an active [[freemason]].&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;

He was initially a member of the [[Scottish Rite]], but came into conflict with the [[Grand Lodge of France]] and switched to the [[Grand Orient of France]] ([[French Rite]]). He was the "Worshipful Master" of a lodge of Russian emigrants known as the "Rose of the Perfect Silence."

==History==
The son of a [[Presbyterian]] minister and a former soldier, [[Marshall Applewhite]] began his foray into [[biblical prophecy]] in the early 1970s. After being fired from the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] over an alleged relationship with one of his male students, he met [[Bonnie Nettles]], a 44-year-old married nurse with an interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and biblical prophecy, in March 1972.{{sfn|Goldwag|2009|p=77}} According to Applewhite's writings, the two met in the psychiatric hospital where she worked during his stay there{{sfnm|Lewis|2003|1p=111|Raine|2005|2p=103}} and quickly became close friends.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=111}} Applewhite later recalled that he felt like he had known Nettles for a long time and concluded that they had met in a past life.{{sfn|Lalich|2004|pp=44, 48}} She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]], persuading him that he had a divine assignment.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=210}}{{sfn|Lalich|2004|p=43}}

Applewhite and Nettles pondered the life of [[St.&amp;nbsp;Francis of Assisi]] and read works by authors including [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[R.&amp;nbsp;D. Laing]], and [[Richard Bach]].{{sfnm|1a1=Zeller|1y=2006|1p=78|2a1=Bearak|2y=1997}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=123}} They kept a [[King James Bible]] with them and studied several passages from the [[New Testament]], focusing on teachings about [[Christology]], [[asceticism]], and [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]].{{sfn|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|pp=42–43}} Applewhite also read [[science fiction]], including works by [[Robert A.&amp;nbsp;Heinlein]] and [[Arthur C.&amp;nbsp;Clarke]].{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=306}} By June 1974, Applewhite and Nettles's beliefs had solidified into a basic outline.{{sfn|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|p=40}} They concluded that they had been chosen to fulfill biblical prophecies, and that they had been given higher-level minds than other people.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=355}} They wrote a pamphlet that described [[Jesus]]' [[reincarnation]] as a Texan, a thinly veiled reference to Applewhite.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=211}} Furthermore, they concluded that they were the [[two witnesses]] described in the [[Book of Revelation]]{{sfn|Zeller|2014b|p=108}} and occasionally visited churches or other spiritual groups to speak of their identities,{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=356|Zeller, "Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics"|2010|2p=40}} often referring to themselves as "The Two", or "The UFO Two".{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=123}}{{sfn|Urban|2000|p=276}} They believed that they would be killed and then restored to life and, in view of others, transported onto a spaceship. This event, which they referred to as "the Demonstration", was to prove their claims.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=211}} To their dismay, these ideas were poorly received by existing religious communities.{{sfn|Bearak|1997}}

Eventually, Applewhite and Nettles resolved to contact extraterrestrials, and they sought like-minded followers. They published advertisements for meetings, where they recruited disciples, whom they called "the crew".{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=356}} At the events, they purported to represent beings from another planet, the Next Level, who sought participants for an experiment. They stated that those who agreed to take part in the experiment would be brought to a higher evolutionary level.{{sfnm|Goerman|2011|1p=60|Chryssides|2005|2p=357}} In 1975, during a group meeting with eighty people in Joan Culpepper's [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]] home, they shared their "simultaneous" revelation that they had been told they were the two witnesses written into the Bible's story of the [[end time]].&lt;ref name="laweekly2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/heavens-gate-the-sequel-2147951 |title=Heaven's Gate: The Sequel |date= 21 March 2007 |accessdate=2016-12-01 |work=LA Weekly }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1975, the crew assembled at a hotel in [[Waldport, Oregon|Waldport]], [[Oregon]]. After selling all "worldly" possessions and saying farewell to loved ones, the group vanished from the hotel and from the public eye.{{sfn|Goldwag|2009|p=77}} That night on the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', [[Walter Cronkite]] reported that the group had disappeared, in one of the very first national reports on the developing religious group: "A score of persons... have disappeared. It's a mystery whether they've been taken on a so-called trip to eternity{{snd}} or simply been taken."&lt;ref name="laweekly2007" /&gt; In reality, Applewhite and Nettles had arranged for the group to go underground. From that point, "Do and Ti" (pronounced "doe and tee"), as the two now called themselves, led the nearly one-hundred-member crew across the country, sleeping in tents and sleeping bags and begging in the streets. Evading detection by the authorities and media enabled the group to focus on Do and Ti's doctrine of helping members of the crew achieve a "higher evolutionary level" above human, to which they claimed to have already reached.&lt;ref name="laweekly2007"/&gt;

Applewhite and Nettles used a variety of [[Pseudonym|aliases]] over the years, notably "[[Little Bo Peep|Bo and Peep]]" and "[[Solfège|Do and Ti]]". The group also had a variety of names{{snd}} prior to the adoption of the name Heaven's Gate (and at the time Vallée studied the group), it was known as Human Individual Metamorphosis (HIM). The group re-invented and renamed itself several times and had a variety of recruitment methods.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan J. Cook, [http://www.anthroufo.info/un-hgate.html Heaven's Gate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129142019/http://anthroufo.info/un-hgate.html |date=2009-01-29 }}, webpage retrieved 2008-10-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven|last=Mizrach|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/heavensgate.html|accessdate=2008-10-10|title=The Facts about Heaven's Gate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517153748/http://www.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/heavensgate.html|archivedate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applewhite believed that he was directly related to Jesus, meaning he was an "Evolutionary Kingdom Level Above Human".

Indeed, Applewhite's writings, which combined aspects of [[Millennialism]], [[Gnosticism]], and science fiction, suggest he believed himself to be Jesus' successor and the "Present Representative" of Christ on Earth.&lt;ref name="laweekly2007"/&gt; Do and Ti taught during the religious movement's early beginnings that Do's bodily "vehicle" was inhabited by the same alien spirit which belonged to Jesus; likewise, Ti (Nettles) was presented as God the Father.&lt;ref name="laweekly2007"/&gt;

The crew used numerous methods of recruitment as they toured the [[United States]] in destitution, proclaiming the gospel of higher level metamorphosis, the deceit of humans by false-god spirits, envelopment with sunlight for meditative healing, and the divinity of the "UFO Two".&lt;ref name="laweekly2007"/&gt; Throughout the late 70s and early 80s, as their belief system developed around the [[cult of personality|cult of personalities]], membership grew. Some sociologists agree that the popular movement of alternative religious experience and individualism found in collective spiritual experiences during that period helped contribute to the growth of the new religious movement. "Sheilaism", as it became known, was a way for people to merge their diverse religious backgrounds and coalesce around a shared, generalized faith, which followers of new religious sects like Applewhite's crew found a very appetizing alternative to traditional dogmas in [[Judaism]], [[Catholicism]] and [[evangelical Christianity]]. Many of Applewhite and Nettle's crew hailed from these very diverse backgrounds; most of them are described by researchers as having been "longtime truth-seekers", or spiritual hippies who had long since believed in attempting to "find themselves" through spiritual means, combining faiths in a sort of cultural [[Social environment|milieu]] well into the mid-80s.{{sfn|Zeller, Benjamin ''Heaven's Gate, America's UFO Religion''|2014|pp= 59–65}} 
However, remarkably, many of those same researchers note that not all of Applewhite's crew were hippies recruited from [[far-left politics|far-left]] alternative religious backgrounds{{snd}} in fact, one such recruit early on was John Craig, a respected [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] running for the [[Colorado House of Representatives]] at the time of joining in 1975.{{sfn|Zeller, Benjamin ''Heaven's Gate, America's UFO Religion''|2014|pp= 65–66}} As recruit numbers grew in its pre-internet days, the clan of "UFO followers" all seemed to have in common a need for communal belonging in an alternative path to higher existence without the constraints of institutionalized faith.

However, it was not until the death of Nettles in 1985 and Applewhite's subsequent revision of the group's doctrines that the crew gained an eventual reputation as a "cyberculture" form of religious thought reform;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.histarch.illinois.edu/harper/millenial5.html |title=Free Will, or Thought Control?; Were the Deaths of Heaven's Gate Members the Result of Brainwashing? |date=4 April 1997 |accessdate=2016-09-30 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the mid-90s, the group had become reclusive, calling themselves by the mysterious business name "Higher Source", and began recruiting via uploaded internet content. Rumors began spreading throughout the group in the following years that the upcoming [[Comet Hale–Bopp]] housed the secret to their ultimate salvation and ascendance into the kingdom of heaven. These rumors continued through various video uploads onto the web page, which gained a mass following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/the-online-legacy-of-a-suicide-cult-and-the-webmasters-1617403237  | title=The Online Legacy of a Suicide Cult and the Webmasters Who Stayed Behind |date=17 September 2014 |accessdate=2016-09-30 |work=Gizmodo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, members of Do's clan took their Internet recruitment and technical savviness to new levels in a large home they called "The Monastery", a 9,000-square-foot residence in [[Rancho Santa Fe, California|Rancho Santa Fe]], near [[San Diego]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/the-online-legacy-of-a-suicide-cult-and-the-webmasters-1617403237 |title=The Online Legacy of a Suicide Cult and the Webmasters Who Stayed Behind |date=17 September 2014 |accessdate=2016-09-30 |work=Gizmodo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The home would eventually be a gathering place for the group's final siren call and the "Closure to Heaven's Gate" that the return of Hale-Bopp comet signified, as the group's web page used to read.

=== Media coverage ===
Known to the mainstream media (though largely ignored through the 1980s and 1990s), Heaven's Gate was better known in [[UFO]] circles as well as in a series of academic studies by sociologist [[Robert Balch]]. ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' host [[Art Bell]] featured Heaven's Gate and the "companion object" in the shadow of Hale-Bopp on several programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/art_bell_heavenrsquos_gate_and_journalistic_integrity/|title=Art Bell, Heaven's Gate, and Journalistic Integrity|last1=Genoni, Jr.|first1=Thomas|website=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaven's Gate received coverage in [[Jacques Vallée]]'s book ''Messengers of Deception'' (1979), in which Vallée described an unusual public meeting organized by the group. Vallée frequently expressed concerns within the book about contactee groups' [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] political and religious outlooks, and Heaven's Gate did not escape criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Messengers of Deception: UFO Contacts and Cults|author=Vallee, Jacques|date=1979|publisher=Ronin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1994, the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' ran an article on the group, then known as "The Total Overcomers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/general/features/they-walk-among-us/15922|title=They Walk Among Us|last=Gardetta|first=Dave|date=21 January 1994|work=LA Weekly|accessdate=2007-08-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328230411/http://www.laweekly.com/general/features/they-walk-among-us/15922/|archivedate=2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this article, Rio DiAngelo discovered the group and eventually joined them.&lt;ref name="bearman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2007-03-22/news/heaven-s-gate-the-sequel/|title=Heaven's Gate: The Sequel|last=Bearman|first=Joshuah|date=21 March 2007|work=[[LA Weekly]]|authorlink=Joshuah Bearman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Theroux]] contacted the Heaven's Gate group while making a program for his [[BBC Two]] documentary series, ''[[Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends]]'', in early March 1997. In response to his e-mail, Theroux was told that Heaven's Gate could not take part in the documentary as "at the present time a project like this would be an interference with what we must focus on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.veoh.com/videos/v266439DxcWKyTx|title=Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends: UFO|author=Louis Theroux|publisher=Veoh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass suicide ===
On March 19–20, 1997, Marshall Applewhite taped himself speaking of mass suicide and asserted "it was the only way to evacuate this Earth". After claiming that a spacecraft was trailing [[Comet Hale–Bopp]], Applewhite persuaded 38 followers to commit suicide so that their souls could board the supposed craft. Applewhite believed that after their deaths, an [[unidentified flying object]] (UFO) would take their souls to another "level of existence above human", which he described as being both physical and spiritual. This and other UFO-related beliefs held by the group have led some observers to characterize the group as a type of [[UFO religion]]. In October 1996, the group purchased [[alien abduction insurance]] that would cover up to 50 members and would pay out $1 million per person (the policy covered abduction, impregnation, or death by aliens).&lt;ref name="insurance"&gt;[http://www.artgomperz.com/newse/abd.html Edith Lederer, "Alien Abduction Insurance Cancelled!"], [[Associated Press]], 2 April 1997, Retrieved March 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The group rented a 9,200-square-foot (850&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) mansion, located near 18341 Colina Norte (later changed to Paseo Victoria) in a [[gated community]] of upscale homes in the [[San Diego]]-area community of [[Rancho Santa Fe, California|Rancho Santa Fe]], from Sam Koutchesfahani, paying $7,000 per month in cash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986136-4,00.html "The Marker We've Been... Waiting For"], by Elizabeth Gleick, Cathy Booth and Pmes Willwerth (Rancho Santa Fe); Nancy Harbert (Albuquerque); Rachele Kanigal (Oakland) and Richard N. Ostling and Noah Robischon (New York). ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. Monday, April 7, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-eight Heaven's Gate members, plus group leader Applewhite, were found dead in the home on March 26, 1997. In the heat of the California spring, many of the bodies had begun to decompose by the time they were discovered. The bodies were later [[cremation|cremated]].

Members took [[phenobarbital]] mixed with apple sauce and washed it all down with [[vodka]]. Additionally, they secured plastic bags around their heads after ingesting the mix to induce [[asphyxia]]tion. Authorities found the dead lying neatly in their own bunk beds, faces and torsos covered by a square purple cloth. Each member carried a five-dollar bill and three quarters in their pockets: the five dollar bill was to cover vagrancy fines while members were out on jobs, while the quarters were to make phone calls. All 39 were dressed in identical black shirts and sweat pants, brand new black-and-white [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] Decades athletic shoes, and armband patches reading "Heaven's Gate [[Away team (Star Trek term)|Away Team]]" (one of many instances of the group's use of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fictional universe]]'s [[nomenclature]]).

The adherents, between the ages of 26 and 72, are believed to have died in three groups over three successive days, with remaining participants cleaning up after each prior group's deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/heavens_gate/5.html|title=Death Mansion|last=Ramsland|first=Katherine|work=All about Heaven's Gate cult|accessdate=2006-09-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211012614/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/heavens_gate/5.html|archivedate=2006-12-11|deadurl=yes|publisher=[[CourtTV]] Crime Library|authorlink=Katherine Ramsland|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen members died on March 24, fifteen more on March 25, and nine on March 26. Leader Applewhite was the third to last member to die; two people remained after him and were the only ones found without bags over their heads. Among the dead was Thomas Nichols, brother of the actress [[Nichelle Nichols]], who is best known for her role as [[Uhura]] in the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9703/28/mass.suicide.pm/|title=Some members of suicide cult castrated|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aftermath ===
The Heaven's Gate event was widely publicized in the [[news media|media]] as an example of [[mass suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9703/28/mass.suicide/index.html|title=First autopsies completed in cult suicide|date=28 March 2016|work=|accessdate=2007-10-06|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; When news broke of the suicides and their relation to Comet Hale–Bopp, the co-discoverer of the comet, [[Alan Hale (Astronomer)|Alan Hale]], was drawn into the story. Hale's phone "never stopped ringing the entire day." He did not respond until the next day, when he spoke at a press conference on the subject only after researching details of the incident.&lt;ref name="Knoxville"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuAg1WA5fW0|title=An Interview with Astronomer Alan Hale{{snd}} CTV call-in (Knoxville Freethought Forum 4/23/13)|website=Youtube.com|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at the Second World Skeptics Congress in [[Heidelberg]], Germany on July 24, 1998:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amber.zine.cz/AZOld/occam/congress.htm|title=Second World Skeptics Congress (Schedule)|website=amber.zine.cz|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=Dr. Hale discussed the scientific significance and popular lore of comets and gave a personal account of his discovery. He then lambasted the combination of scientific illiteracy, willful delusions, a radio talk-show's deception about an imaginary spacecraft following the comet, and a cult's bizarre yearnings for ascending to another level of existence that led to the Heaven's Gate mass suicides.&lt;ref name = SI&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title=Science and Reason, Foibles and Fallacies, and Doomsdays|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=1998|volume=22|issue=6|page=6|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/science_and_reason_foibles_and_fallacies_and_doomsdays|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hale said that well before Heaven's Gate, he had told a colleague:
{{Quote|text='We are probably going to have some suicides as a result of this comet.' The sad part is that I was really not surprised. Comets are lovely objects, but they don't have apocalyptic significance. We must use our minds, our reason.&lt;ref name = SI/&gt;}}

Two former members of Heaven's Gate, Wayne Cooke and Charlie Humphreys, later committed suicide in a similar manner. Humphreys survived a [[suicide pact]] with Cooke in May 1997, but ultimately killed himself in February 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070318/news_lz1n18timelin.html|title=Heaven's Gate: A timeline|date=18 March 2007|work=[[U-T San Diego|The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003124716/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070318/news_lz1n18timelin.html|archivedate=2008-10-03|accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/07/us/ex-cultist-dies-in-suicide-pact-2d-is-critical.html|title=Ex-Cultist Dies In Suicide Pact; 2d Is 'Critical'|last=Purdum|first=Todd S.|date=May 7, 1997|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2007-10-21|quote=A former member of the Heaven's Gate cult was found dead today in a copycat suicide in a motel room near the scene of the group's mass suicide in San Diego County, and another former member was found unconscious in the same room, the authorities said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original 39 deaths also motivated the April 1997 suicide of a 58-year-old California man, who left a note saying he hoped to join the dead Heaven's Gate members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/heavens-gate-member-found-dead-1260149.html|title=Heaven's Gate member found dead|last=Cornwell|first=Tim|date=7 May 1997|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=23 June 2014|quote=In an earlier suicide bid, on 1 April, a 58-year-old recluse was found dead in his home in a remote mountain canyon in northern California after committing suicide.

Two surviving members still maintain the group's website, although it has not been altered since the suicide.  The two do not identify themselves in interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/two-decades-after-heavens-gate-10158830|title=Mass suicide survivors who stayed behind to keep death cult's bizarre teachings alive for 20 years|last=Harding|first=Nick|date=April 4, 2017|work=|access-date=July 31, 2018|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belief system==
Heaven's Gate members believed the planet [[Earth]] was about to be "recycled" ("wiped clean, renewed, refurbished, and rejuvenated"), and the only chance to survive was to leave it immediately. While the group was against [[suicide]], they defined "suicide" in their own context to mean "to turn against the Next Level when it is being offered" and believed their "human" bodies were only vessels meant to help them on their journey. In conversation, when referring to a person or a person's body, they routinely used the word "vehicle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ramsland |first=Katherine |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/heavens_gate/4.html |title=The Heaven's Gate Cult: The Real End |website=[[Crime Library]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210050304/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/heavens_gate/4.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the group added -ody to the first names they adopted in lieu of their original given names, which defines "children of the Next Level". This is mentioned in Applewhite's final video, ''Do's Final Exit'', filmed March 19–20, 1997, just days prior to the suicides.

They believed "to be eligible for membership in the Next Level, humans would have to shed every attachment to the planet". This meant all members had to give up all human-like characteristics, such as their family, friends, sexuality, individuality, jobs, money, and possessions.&lt;ref name="Balch2002_211"&gt;{{cite book|last=Balch|first=Robert|date=2002|chapter=Making Sense of the Heaven's Gate Suicides|editor1-first=David G.|editor1-last=Bromley|editor2-first=J. Gordon|editor2-last=Melton|title=Cults, Religion, and Violence|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Evolutionary Level Above Human" (TELAH) was as a "physical, corporeal place",{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=38}} another world in our universe,{{sfn|Zeller|2014b|p=99}} where residents live in pure bliss and nourish themselves by absorbing pure sunlight.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=102}} At the next level, beings do not engage in sexual intercourse, eating or dying, the things that make us "mammalian" here.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=155}} Heaven's Gate believed that what the Bible calls God is actually a highly developed [[Extraterrestrial life|Extraterrestrial]].{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=95}}

Members of Heaven's Gate believed that evil space aliens{{snd}} called Luciferians{{snd}} falsely represented themselves to Earthlings as "God" and conspired to keep humans from developing.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=104}} Technically advanced humanoids, these aliens have spacecraft, space-time travel, telepathy, and increased longevity.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=104}} They use holograms to fake miracles.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=155}}  Carnal beings with gender, they stopped training to achieve the Kingdom of God thousands of years ago.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=104}} Heaven's Gate believed that all existing religions on Earth had been corrupted by these malevolent aliens.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=182}}

Although these basic beliefs of the group stayed generally consistent over the years, "the details of their ideology were flexible enough to undergo modification over time."&lt;ref name="Lewis2001_16"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2001|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are examples of the group's adding to or slightly changing their beliefs, such as: modifying the way one can enter the Next Level, changing the way they described themselves, placing more importance on the idea of [[Satan]], and adding several other [[New Age]] concepts. One of these concepts was the belief of extraterrestrial [[walk-in]]s; when the group began, "Applewhite and Nettles taught their followers that they were extraterrestrial beings. However, after the notion of walk-ins became popular within the New Age subculture, the Two changed their tune and began describing themselves as extraterrestrial walk-ins."&lt;ref name="Lewis2001_16"/&gt; The idea of walk-ins is very similar to the concept of being possessed by spirits. A walk-in can be defined as "an entity who occupies a body that has been vacated by its original soul".  Heaven's Gate came to believe an extraterrestrial walk-in is "a walk-in that is supposedly from another planet."&lt;ref name="Lewis2001_368"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2001|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of walk-ins aided Applewhite and Nettles in personally starting from what they considered to be clean slates. In this so-called clean slate, they were no longer considered by members of this Heaven's Gate group to be the people they had been prior to the start of the group, but had taken on a new life; this concept gave them a way to "erase their human personal histories as the histories of souls who formerly occupied the bodies of Applewhite and Nettles."&lt;ref name="Lewis2001_368"/&gt;

Another New Age belief Applewhite and Nettles adopted was the [[ancient astronaut]] hypothesis. The term "ancient astronauts" is used to refer to various forms of the concept that extraterrestrials visited Earth in the distant past.&lt;ref name="Lewis2001_16"/&gt; Applewhite and Nettles took part of this concept and taught it as the belief that "aliens planted the seeds of current humanity millions of years ago, and have to come to reap the harvest of their work in the form of spiritually evolved individuals who will join the ranks of flying saucer crews. Only a select few members of humanity will be chosen to advance to this [[transhuman]] state. The rest will be left to wallow in the spiritually poisoned atmosphere of a corrupt world."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the individuals who chose to join Heaven's Gate, follow Applewhite and Nettle's belief system, and make the sacrifices required by membership would be allowed to escape human suffering.

===Techniques to enter the next level===

According to Heaven's Gate, once the individual has perfected himself through the "process", there were four methods to enter or "graduate" to the next level:{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=193}}

# Physical pickup onto a TELAH spacecraft and transfer to a next level body aboard that craft.  In this version, what Professor Zeller calls a "UFO" version of the "[[Rapture]]", an alien spacecraft would descend to Earth, collect Applewhite, Nettles, and their followers, and their human bodies would be transformed through biological and chemical processes to perfected beings.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=31}}
# Natural death, accidental death, or death from random violence.  Here, the "graduating soul" leaves the human container for a perfected next-level body.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|pp=123–24}}
# Outside persecution that leads to death.  After the deaths of the [[Branch Davidians]] in Waco, Texas and the events involving [[Randy Weaver]] at [[Ruby Ridge]], Applewhite was afraid that the American government would murder the members of Heaven's Gate.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=184}}
# Willful exit from the body in a dignified manner.  Near the end, Applewhite had a revelation that they may have to abandon their human bodies and achieve the next level as Jesus had done.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|pp=123–24}} This occurred on March 22 and 23 when 39 members committed suicide and "graduated".{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|pp=171–72}}

==Structure==
Open only to adults over the age of eighteen,{{sfn|Zeller|2014b|p=38}} group members gave up their possessions and lived a highly [[Ascetism|ascetic]] life devoid of many indulgences. The group was tightly knit and everything was shared [[Commune (intentional community)|communally]]. In public, members always carried only a five-dollar bill and one roll of quarters.{{sfn|Zeller|2014b|p=143}} Eight of the male members of the group, including Applewhite, voluntarily underwent [[castration]] in Mexico as an extreme means of maintaining the ascetic lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culteducation.com/hgate.html|first=Rick|last=Ross|title='Heaven's Gate' Suicides|date=October 1999|publisher=The Rick A. Ross Institute|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020114093018/http://www.culteducation.com/hgate.html|archivedate=2002-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group earned revenues by offering professional website development for paying clients under the name ''Higher Source''.&lt;ref name="paybills"&gt;{{cite news | first = Elizabeth | last = Weise | title = Internet Provided Way To Pay Bills, Spread Message Before Suicide | url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970328&amp;slug=2531080 | agency = Associated Press | publisher = Seattle Times | date = 1997-03-28 | accessdate = 2007-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural theorist [[Paul Virilio]] has described the group as a [[cybersect]], due to its heavy reliance on [[computer mediated communication]] as a mode of communication prior to the group's collective suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Virilio, ''The Information Bomb'' (Verso, 2005), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''historicity of the Bible''' is the question of the Bible's "acceptability as a history", in the words of [[Thomas L. Thompson]], a scholar who has written widely on this topic as it relates to the [[Old Testament]].{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=164}} This can be extended to the question of the Christian [[New Testament]] as an accurate record of the [[historical Jesus]] and the [[Apostolic Age]].

Many fields of study span the Bible and history; such fields range from [[archeology]] and [[astronomy]] to [[linguistics]] and [[comparative literature]]. Scholars also examine the [[historical context]] of Bible passages, the importance ascribed to events by the [[authors of the Bible|authors]], and the contrast between the descriptions of these events and other [[historical evidence]].

Archaeological [[List of artifacts in biblical archaeology|discoveries]] since the 19th century are open to interpretation, but broadly speaking they lend support to few of the [[Old Testament]]'s narratives as history and offer evidence to challenge others.{{efn|1={{quote|Biblical archaeology has helped us understand a lot about the world of the Bible and clarified a considerable amount of what we find in the Bible. But the archaeological record has not been friendly for one vital issue, Israel's origins: the period of slavery in Egypt, the mass departure of Israelite slaves from Egypt, and the violent conquest of the land of Canaan by the Israelites. The strong consensus is that there is at best sparse indirect evidence for these biblical episodes, and for the conquest there is considerable evidence against it.|Peter Enns.{{sfn|Enns|2013|p=unpaginated}}&lt;!--end of quote--&gt;}}&lt;!--end efn--&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;

==Materials and methods==

===Manuscripts and canons===
The Bible exists in multiple manuscripts, none of them an [[autograph]], and multiple [[Biblical canon|canons]], which do not completely agree on which books have sufficient authority to be included or their order (see [[Books of the Bible]]). The early discussions about the exclusion or integration of various [[apocrypha]] involve an early idea about the historicity of the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fDd4dQek-DsC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=historizit%25C3%25A4t+der+bibel+apokryphen#v=onepage&amp;q=historizit%25C3%25A4t%2520der%2520bibel%2520apokryphen&amp;f=false|title=Theologie des Kanons: der christliche Kanon, seine Hermeneutik und die Historizität seiner Aussagen ; die Lehren der Kirchenväter als Grundlegung der Lehre von der Heiligen Schrift|last=Grosse|first=Sven|date=2011-01-01|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3643800787|location=|pages=91–92|language=de|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ionian Enlightenment]] influenced early patrons like [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Tertullian]] – both saw the biblical texts as being different to (and having more historicity than) the myths of other religions. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] was aware of the difference between science and scripture and defended the historicity of the biblical texts e.g. against claims of [[Faustus of Mileve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fDd4dQek-DsC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=historizit%25C3%25A4t+der+bibel+apokryphen#v=onepage&amp;q=justin&amp;f=false|title=Theologie des Kanons: der christliche Kanon, seine Hermeneutik und die Historizität seiner Aussagen ; die Lehren der Kirchenväter als Grundlegung der Lehre von der Heiligen Schrift|last=Grosse|first=Sven|date=2011-01-01|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3643800787|location=|pages=94|language=de|quote=One does not read in the Gospel that the Lord said: "I will send you the Paraclete who will teach you about the course of the sun and moon." For He willed to make them Christians, not mathematicians. (Translation of the German Quote according wikiquote)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians hold that the Bible should not be treated differently from other historical (or literary) sources from the ancient world. One may compare doubts about the historicity of e.g. [[Herodotus]]; the consequence of these discussions is not that we shall have to stop using ancient sources for historical reconstruction, but that we need to be aware of the problems involved when doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zqJxkKy-cMMC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=herodotus+ancient+sources+barstad#v=onepage&amp;q=herodotus%2520ancient%2520sources%2520barstad&amp;f=false|title=History and the Hebrew Bible: Studies in Ancient Israelite and Ancient Near Eastern Historiography|last=Barstad|first=Hans M.|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3161498091|location=|pages=40–42|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few texts survive directly from antiquity: most have been copied – some, many times. To determine the accuracy of a copied manuscript, [[Textual criticism|textual critics]] examine the way the transcripts have passed through history to their extant forms. The higher the consistency of the earliest texts, the greater their textual reliability, and the less chance that the content has been changed over the years. Multiple copies may also be grouped into text types (see [[New Testament#Early manuscripts|New Testament text types]]), with some types judged closer to the hypothetical original than others. Differences often extend beyond minor variations and may involve, for instance, interpolation of passages central to issues of historicity and doctrine, such as the [[Mark 16#Mark 16:9–20 in the manuscripts and patristic evidence|ending of Mark 16]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Writing and reading history===
[[File:William Albright 1957.jpg|thumb|left|W.F. Albright, the doyen of biblical archaeology, in 1957]]
The meaning of the term "history" is itself dependent on social and historical context. Paula McNutt, for instance, notes that the Old Testament narratives "do not record 'history' ''in the sense that history is understood in the twentieth century'' ... The past, for biblical writers as well as for twentieth-century readers of the Bible, has meaning only when it is considered in light of the present, and perhaps an idealized future."&lt;ref name="isbn0-281-05259-X"&gt;{{cite book |last=McNutt |first=Paula M. |title=Reconstructing the society of ancient Israel |publisher=SPCK |location=London |year=1999 |isbn=978-0281052592 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hd28MdGNyTYC |page=4, emphasis added}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even from the earliest times, there was an awareness that parts of the scriptures could not be interpreted as a strictly consistent sequence of events.  The [[Talmud]] cites a dictum ascribed to the third-century teacher [[Abba Arika]] that "there is no chronological order in the Torah".&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud|BT]] ''[[Pesachim (Talmud)|Pesachim]]'' [http://juchre.org/talmud/pesachim/pesachim1.htm#6b 6b]. Literally: ''no earlier or later in the Torah''&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples were often presented and discussed in later Jewish [[exegesis]] with, according to [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], an ongoing discourse between those who would follow the views of [[Rabbi Ishmael]] that "the Torah speaks in human language", compared to the more mystical approach of [[Rabbi Akiva]] that any such deviations should signpost some deeper order or purpose, to be divined.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] (1962 / translation 2006), ''Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations'', p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WAGK8GiNrQgC&amp;pg=PA240 240]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the modern era, the focus of Biblical history has also diversified. The project of [[Biblical archaeology school|biblical archaeology]] associated with [[W.F. Albright]], which sought to validate the historicity of the events narrated in the Bible through the ancient texts and material remains of the [[Near East]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-8446-0003-2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Albright |first=William Foxwell |title=Archaeology of Palestine |publisher=Peter Smith Pub Inc |year=1985 |page=128 |quote=Discovery after discovery has established the accuracy of innumerable details of the Bible as a source of history. |isbn=978-0844600031}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a more specific focus compared to the more expansive view of history described by archaeologist [[William G. Dever|William Dever]]. In discussing the role of his discipline in interpreting the biblical record, Dever has pointed to multiple histories within the Bible, including the history of theology (the relationship between God and believers), political history (usually the account of "Great Men"), narrative history (the chronology of events), intellectual history (ideas and their development, context and evolution), socio-cultural history (institutions, including their social underpinnings in family, clan, tribe and social class and the state), cultural history (overall cultural evolution, demography, socio-economic and political structure and ethnicity), technological history (the techniques by which humans adapt to, exploit and make use of the resources of their environment), natural history (how humans discover and adapt to the ecological facts of their natural environment), and material history (artifacts as correlates of changes in human behaviour).&lt;ref&gt;Dever, William G. (2008), "[[Did God Have a Wife?]]: Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient Israel" (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company)&lt;/ref&gt;

A special challenge for assessing the historicity of the Bible is sharply differing perspectives on the relationship between narrative history and theological meaning. Supporters of [[biblical literalism]] "deny that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual, religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of history and science. We further deny that scientific hypotheses about earth history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation and the flood."&lt;ref name="isbn1-58134-056-7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Henry |first=Carl Ferdinand Howard |volume=4 |chapter=The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy |title=God, Revelation and Authority |publisher=Crossway Books |location=Wheaton, Ill |year=1999 |origyear=1979 |pages=211–219 |isbn=978-1581340563 |chapter-url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/chicago.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115025545/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/chicago.htm |archivedate=2006-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But prominent scholars have expressed diametrically opposing views: "[T]he stories about the promise given to the patriarchs in Genesis are not historical, nor do they intend to be historical; they are rather historically determined expressions about Israel and Israel's relationship to its God, given in forms legitimate to their time, and their truth lies not in their facticity, nor in the historicity, but their ability to express the reality that Israel experienced."&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Thomas |title=The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives: The Quest for the Historical Abraham |publisher=Trinity Press International |location=Valley Forge, Pa |year=2002 |origyear=1974 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lwrzapZYqFAC |isbn=978-1563383892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorship===

{{main|Authorship of the Bible}}
A central pillar of the Bible's historical authority was the tradition that it had been composed by the principal actors or eyewitnesses to the events described&amp;nbsp;– the [[Pentateuch]] was the work of Moses, Joshua was by Joshua, and so on. But the [[Protestant Reformation]] had brought the actual texts to a much wider audience, which combined with the growing climate of intellectual ferment in the 17th century that was the start of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] threw a harsh sceptical spotlight on these traditional claims. In Protestant England, the philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his major work [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]] (1651) denied Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, and identified Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles as having been written long after the events they purported to describe. His conclusions rested on internal textual evidence, but in an argument that resonates with modern debates, he noted: "Who were the original writers of the several Books of Holy Scripture, has not been made evident by any sufficient testimony of other History, which is the only proof of matter of fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hobbes |first=Thomas |title=Leviathan|chapter=Chapter XXXIII.

[[File:Title page of the" Histoire critique du vieux testament" by Richard Simon.jpg|thumb|left|Title page of Simon's ''Critical history'', 1682.]]
The Jewish philosopher and pantheist [[Baruch Spinoza]] echoed Hobbes's doubts about the provenance of the historical books in his ''A Theologico-Political Treatise'' (published in 1670),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spinoza |first=Baruch |title=A Theologico-Political Treatise (Part II) |chapter=Chapter VIII.

He had earlier been effectively excommunicated by the rabbinical council of [[Amsterdam]] for his perceived [[heresies]]. The French priest [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] brought these critical perspectives to the [[Catholic]] tradition in 1678, observing "the most part of the Holy Scriptures that are come to us, are but Abridgments and as Summaries of ancient Acts which were kept in the Registries of the Hebrews," in what was probably the first work of biblical textual criticism in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Richard |title=A critical history of the Old Testament|year=1682|location=London|page=21|publisher=Walter Davis|url=https://archive.org/details/SimonRichard1638-1712ACriticalHistoryOfTheOldTestament1682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response [[Jean Astruc]], applying [[source criticism]] methods common in the analysis of classical secular texts to the Pentateuch, believed he could detect four different manuscript traditions, which he claimed Moses himself had redacted. (p.&amp;nbsp;62–64)&lt;ref name="isbn0-8308-2551-7"/&gt; His 1753 book initiated the school known as [[higher criticism]] that culminated in [[Julius Wellhausen]] formalising the [[documentary hypothesis]] in the 1870s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wellhausen |first=Julius |title=Prolegomena to the History of Israel |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Adam and Charles Black |year=1885 |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cv/phai/index.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; which identifies these narratives as the [[Jahwist]], [[Elohist]], [[Deuteronomist]], and the [[Priestly source]]. While versions of the Documentary Hypothesis vary in the order in which they were composed, the circumstances of their composition, and the date of their redaction(s), their shared terminology continues to provide the framework for modern theories on the composite nature and origins of the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Wenham|Wenham, Gordon]]. "[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_pentateuch_wenham.html Pentateuchal Studies Today]," ''[[Themelios]]'' 22.1 (October 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century the scholarly consensus was that the Pentateuch was the work of many authors writing from 1000 BCE (the time of [[David]]) to 500 BCE (the time of Ezra) and redacted c. 450, and as a consequence whatever history it contained was more often polemical than strictly factual&amp;nbsp;– a conclusion reinforced by the then fresh scientific refutations of what were at the time widely classed as biblical mythologies.

====Genesis creation narrative====

{{see also|Genesis creation narrative}}
There is a Christian tradition of criticism of the creation narratives in Genesis dating back to at least [[St Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430), and Jewish tradition has also maintained a critical thread in its approach to biblical primeval history. The influential medieval philosopher [[Maimonides]] maintained a skeptical ambiguity toward creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' and considered the stories about [[Adam]] more as "philosophical anthropology, rather than as historical stories whose protagonist is the 'first man'."&lt;ref name="isbn90-247-3439-8"&gt;{{cite book |last=Klein-Braslavy |first=Sara |editor=Pines, S. |editor2=Yovel, Y. |title=Maimonides and Philosophy (International Archives of the History of Ideas / Archives internationales d'histoire des idées) |chapter=The Creation of the world and Maimonides' interpretation of Gen. i–v |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=1986 |pages=65–78 |isbn=978-9024734399 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=SzymWqsNulMC&amp;pg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek philosophers [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' I, 7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Critolaus]]{{sfn|Dorandi|1999|p=50}} and [[Proclus]]{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=2}} held that the [[Eternity of the world|world was eternal]].  Such interpretations are inconsistent with what was after the Protestant Reformation to be "commonly perceived in evangelicalism as traditional views of Genesis".{{efn|{{quote|But someone may ask: 'Is not Scripture opposed to those who hold that heaven is spherical, when it says, who stretches out heaven like a skin?'

The publication of [[James Hutton]]'s ''Theory of the Earth'' in 1788 was an important development in the scientific revolution that would dethrone Genesis as the ultimate authority on primeval earth and [[prehistory]]. The first casualty was the Creation story itself, and by the early 19th century "no responsible scientist contended for the literal credibility of the Mosaic account of creation."&lt;ref name="isbn0-674-34481-2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gillispie |first=Charles Coulston |title=Genesis and geology: a study in the relations of scientific thought, natural theology, and social opinion in Great Britain, 1790–1850 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1996 |origyear=1951 |isbn=978-0674344815 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PKERMZkA9A0C |page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle between [[uniformitarianism]] and [[catastrophism]] kept the Flood alive in the emerging discipline, until [[Adam Sedgwick]], the president of the Geological Society, publicly recanted his previous support in his 1831 presidential address:&lt;blockquote&gt;We ought indeed to have paused before we first adopted the diluvian theory, and referred all our old superficial gravel to the action of the Mosaic Flood. For of man, and the works of his hands, we have not yet found a single trace among the remnants of the former world entombed in those deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book |last=Gillispie |first=Charles Coulston |title=Genesis and geology: a study in the relations of scientific thought, natural theology, and social opinion in Great Britain, 1790–1850 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1996 |origyear=1951 |isbn=978-0674344815 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PKERMZkA9A0C |pages=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
All of which left the "first man" and his putative descendants in the awkward position of being stripped of all historical context, until [[Charles Darwin]] naturalized the Garden of Eden with the publication of ''[[On The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859. Public acceptance of this scientific revolution was, at the time, uneven, but has since grown significantly. The mainstream scholarly community soon arrived at a consensus, which holds today, that Genesis 1–11 is a highly schematic literary work representing [[theology]]/symbolic [[mythology]] rather than actual history or science.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8308-2551-7"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wenham |first=Gordon J. |title=Exploring the Old Testament: A Guide to the Pentateuch|chapter=Genesis 1–11 |publisher=InterVarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, Ill |year=2003 |isbn=978-0830825516 |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Patriarchs====
{{main|Patriarchs (Bible)}}
In the following decades [[Hermann Gunkel]] drew attention to the mythic aspects of the Pentateuch, and [[Albrecht Alt]], [[Martin Noth]] and the [[tradition history]] school argued that although its core traditions had genuinely ancient roots, the narratives were fictional framing devices and were not intended as history in the modern sense. Though doubts have been cast on the historiographic reconstructions of this school (particularly the notion of oral traditions as a primary ancient source), much of its critique of biblical historicity found wide acceptance. Gunkel's observation that
{{quote|1=if, however, we consider figures like Abraham, Issac, and Jacob to be actual persons with no original mythic foundations, that does not at all mean that they are historical figures ... For even if, as may well be assumed, there was once a man call 'Abraham,' everyone who knows the history of legends is sure that the legend is in no position at the distance of so many centuries to preserve a picture of the personal piety of Abraham. The 'religion of Abraham' is, in reality, the religion of the legend narrators which they attribute to Abraham.{{sfn|Gunkel|1997|p=lxviii}}
|sign=|source=}}
has in various forms become a commonplace of contemporary criticism.{{efn|{{quote|[F]or not only has "archaeology" not proven a single event of the patriarchal tradition to be historical, it has not shown any of the traditions to be likely ... it must be concluded that any such historicity as is commonly spoken of in both scholarly and popular works about the patriarchs of Genesis is hardly possible and totally improbable.|Thomas Thompson.&lt;ref name="Thompson, p. 328"&gt;Thompson, ''op cit'', p. 328{{full citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!--end of efn--&gt;}}

In the United States the [[biblical archaeology]] movement, under the influence of Albright, counterattacked, arguing that the broad outline within the framing narratives was also true, so that while scholars could not realistically expect to prove or disprove individual episodes from the life of Abraham and the other [[patriarchs]], these were real individuals who could be placed in a context proven from the archaeological record. But as more discoveries were made, and anticipated finds failed to materialise, it became apparent that archaeology did not in fact support the claims made by Albright and his followers. Today, only a minority of scholars continue to work within this framework, mainly for reasons of religious conviction.&lt;ref name="isbn0-385-42590-2"&gt;{{harvnb|Mazar|1992|p={{page needed|date=March 2016}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Dever stated in 1993 that
{{quote|[Albright's] central theses have all been overturned, partly by further advances in Biblical criticism, but mostly by the continuing archaeological research of younger Americans and Israelis to whom he himself gave encouragement and momentum ... The irony is that, in the long run, it will have been the newer 'secular' archaeology that contributed the most to Biblical studies, not 'Biblical archaeology'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dever |first=William |doi=10.2307/3210358 |title=What Remains of the House that Albright Built?|journal=The Biblical Archaeologist |volume=56|issue=1|date=March 1993 |pages=25–35 |jstor=3210358}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Deuteronomistic history===
{{main|Deuteronomist}}
Many scholars believe that the 'Deuteronomistic History’ preserved elements of ancient texts and oral tradition, including geo-political and socio-economic  realities and certain information about historical figures and events. However, large portions of it are legendary and it contains many anachronisms.&lt;ref name=mazar/&gt;

====The "Conquest Narrative" in Joshua and Judges====
A major issue in the historicity debate was the narrative of the Israelite conquest of Canaan, described in Joshua and Judges. The American Albright school asserted that the biblical narrative of conquest would be affirmed by archaeological record; and indeed for much of the 20th century archaeology appeared to support the biblical narrative, including excavations at Beitin (identified as Bethel), Tel ed-Duweir, (identified as Lachish), Hazor, and Jericho.&lt;ref name=FinkelsteinSilberman2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=OEANE&gt;{{cite book |last=Holland |first=Thomas A.| title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East | chapter=Jericho | publisher=Oxford University Press | editor=Eric M. Meyers | year=1997 | pages=220–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, flaws in the conquest narrative appeared. The most high-profile example was the "fall of [[Jericho]]", excavated by [[John Garstang]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=FinkelsteinSilberman2002/&gt; Garstang originally announced that he had found fallen walls dating to the time of the biblical [[Battle of Jericho]], but later revised the destruction to a much earlier period.&lt;ref name=OEANE/&gt; [[Kathleen Kenyon]] dated the destruction of the walled city to the middle of the 16th century ({{circa}} 1550 BCE), too early to match the usual dating of the Exodus to Pharaoh Ramses, on the basis of her excavations in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kenyon |first=Kathleen M.| title=Digging up Jericho: The Results of the Jericho Excavations, 1952–1956 | publisher=Praeger | place=New York | year=1957 | page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same conclusion, based on an analysis of all the excavation findings, was reached by Piotr Bienkowski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bienkowski |first=Piotr| title=Jericho in the Late Bronze Age | publisher=Warminster | year=1986 | pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s it had become clear that the archaeological record did not, in fact, support the account of the conquest given in Joshua: the cities which the Bible records as having been destroyed by the Israelites were either uninhabited at the time, or, if destroyed, were destroyed at widely different times, not in one brief period.&lt;ref name="FinkelsteinSilberman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Israel Finkelstein|author2=Neil Asher Silberman|title=The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Sacred Texts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lu6ywyJr0CMC&amp;pg=PA81|year=2001|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0743223386|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Israel Finkelstein, the consensus for the conquest narrative was abandoned in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name= FinkelsteinSilberman2002/&gt;

In his view, the Book of Joshua conflates several independent battles between disparate groups over the centuries, and artificially attributes them to a single leader, Joshua.&lt;ref name=Peakes&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a few cases where the biblical record is not contradicted by the archaeological record. For example, [[stratum]] in [[Tel Hazor]], found in a [[destruction layer]] from around 1200&amp;nbsp;BCE, shows signs of catastrophic fire, and cuneiform tablets found at the site refer to monarchs named ''Ibni Addi'', where ''Ibni'' may be the [[etymology|etymological]] origin of ''Yavin'' (''Jabin''), the Canaanite leader referred to in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early%20History%20-%20Archaeology/Hatzor%20-%20The%20Head%20of%20all%20those%20Kingdoms|title=Hatzor-The Head of all those Kingdoms|publisher=|accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Finkelstein&gt;{{Harvnb|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city also show signs of having been a magnificent Canaanite city prior to its destruction, with great temples and opulent palaces,&lt;ref name=Finkelstein/&gt; split into an upper [[acropolis]], and lower city; the town evidently had been a major Canaanite city. Finklestein theorized that the destruction of Hazor was the result of civil strife, attacks by the [[Sea Peoples]], and/or a result of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|general collapse]] of civilization across the whole eastern Mediterranean in the Late Bronze Age, rather than being caused by the Israelites.&lt;ref name=Finkelstein/&gt;

====Books of Samuel====
The Books of Samuel are considered to be based on both historical and legendary sources, primarily serving to fill the gap in Israelite history after the events described in [[Deuteronomy]]. The battles involving the destruction of the Canaanites are not supported by archaeological record, and it is now widely believed that the Israelites themselves originated as a sub-group of Canaanites.&lt;ref name="Tubb 1998 13–14"&gt;{{harvnb|Tubb|1998|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcnutt47&gt;McNutt 1999, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.

Please clarify the source.  --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}For example, there is mention of later armor (1 Samuel 17:4–7, 38–39; 25:13), use of [[camel]]s (1 Samuel 30:17), and cavalry (as distinct from chariotry) (1 Samuel 13:5, 2 Samuel 1:6), iron picks and axes (as though they were common) (2 Samuel 12:31), sophisticated siege techniques (2 Samuel 20:15). There is a gargantuan troop (2 Samuel 17:1), a battle with 20,000 casualties (2 Samuel 18:7), and a reference to Kushite paramilitary and servants, clearly giving evidence of a date in which [[Kushites]] were common, after the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th Dynasty of Egypt]], the period of the last quarter of the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref name="isbn0-691-00086-7"&gt;{{cite book |last=Redford |first=Donald B. |title=Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in ancient times|publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=1992 |page=305 |isbn=978-0691000862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Monarchy====
Much of the focus of modern criticism has been the historicity of the "United Monarchy" of Israel, which according to the Hebrew Bible ruled over both Judea and Samaria around the 10th century BCE.
[[Thomas L. Thompson]], a leading [[biblical minimalism|minimalist]] scholar for example has written-

:"There is no evidence of a United Monarchy, no evidence of a capital in Jerusalem or of any coherent, unified political force that dominated western Palestine, let alone an empire of the size the legends describe. We do not have evidence for the existence of kings named Saul, David or Solomon; nor do we have evidence for any temple at Jerusalem in this early period. What we do know of Israel and Judah of the tenth century does not allow us to interpret this lack of evidence as a gap in our knowledge and information about the past, a result merely of the accidental nature of archeology. There is neither room nor context, no artifact or archive that points to such historical realities in Palestine's tenth century. One cannot speak historically of a state without a population. Nor can one speak of a capital without a town. Stories are not enough."

In Iron Age IIa (corresponding to the Monarchal period) Judah seems to have been limited to small, mostly rural and unfortified settlements in the Judean hills.&lt;ref name=mazar/&gt; This contrasts to the upper [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samaria]] which was becoming urbanized. This archaeological evidence as well as textual criticism has led many modern historians to treat Israel/Samaria and Judah as arising separately as distinct albeit related entities centered at [[Shechem]] and [[Jerusalem]] respectively, and not as a united kingdom with a capital in Jerusalem.

Excavations at [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]], an Iron site located in Judah, support the biblical account of a United Monarchy. The [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] stated: "The excavations at Khirbat Qeiyafa clearly reveal an urban society that existed in Judah already in the late eleventh century BCE. It can no longer be argued that the Kingdom of Judah developed only in the late eighth century BCE or at some other later date."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Yossi|last1=Garfinkel|first2=Sa‘ar |last2=Ganor|first3=Michael |last3= Hasel |date=19 April 2012|url=http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.asp?id=1989|title=Journal 124: Khirbat Qeiyafa Preliminary Report|publisher=Hadashot-esi.org.il|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516105045/http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.asp?id=1989|archivedate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of Jerusalem in the 10th century BCE is a major subject of debate.&lt;ref name=mazar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mazar|first1=Amihai|editor1-last=Kratz|editor1-first=Reinhard G.|editor2-last=Spieckermann|editor2-first=Hermann|editor3-last=Corzilius|editor3-first=Björn|editor4-last=Pilger|editor4-first=Tanja|title=One God - one cult - one nation archaeological and biblical perspectives|date=2010|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin, New York|isbn=978-3110223583|pages=29–58|chapter=Archaeology and the Biblical Narrative: The Case of the United Monarchy|doi=10.1515/9783110223583.29|chapter-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402220726/http://www.rehov.org/Rehov/publications/Mazar%20-%20The%20United%20%20Monarchy-BZAW2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The oldest part of Jerusalem and its original urban core is the City of David, which does not show evidence of significant Israelite residential activity until the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjkz_8EMoaUC&amp;pg=PA302#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Biblical History and Israel S Past: The Changing Study of the Bible and History|first1=Megan Bishop|last1=Moore|first2=Brad E.|last2=Kelle|date=17 May 2011|publisher=Wm.

Amihai Mazar contends that if the Iron I/Iron IIa dating of administrative structures in the City of David are correct, (as he believes) "Jerusalem was a rather small town with a mighty citadel, which could have been a center of a substantial regional polity."&lt;ref name=mazar/&gt;

Since Jerusalem has been destroyed and then subsequently rebuilt approximately 15 to 20 times since the time of David and Solomon, some argue much of the evidence of 10th century habitation could easily have been eliminated. However, Israel Finkelstein notes that significant architecture from later in the Iron Age (Iron IIb) has been found.

==New Testament==

===Historicity of Jesus===
{{main|Historicity of Jesus}}
The historicity of some New Testament teachings of Jesus is also debated by biblical scholars. The "[[quest for the historical Jesus]]" began as early as the 18th century, and has continued to this day. The most notable recent scholarship came in the 1980s and 1990s with the work of [[J. D. Crossan]],&lt;ref&gt;Crossan, J. D. "The Historical Jesus: A Mediterranean Jewish Peasant," HarperOne, 1993, {{ISBN|0060616296}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James D. G. Dunn]],&lt;ref&gt;James D. G. Dunn, "Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making, Vol. 1, Eerdmans, 2003"&lt;/ref&gt; [[John P. Meier]],&lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, "A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus, 3 vols., the most recent volume from Yale University Press, 2001"&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. P. Sanders]]&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, E.P. "The Historical Figure of Jesus," Penguin, 1996, {{ISBN|0141928220}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[N. T. Wright]]&lt;ref&gt;Wright, N.T. "Jesus and the Victory of God: Christian Origins and the Question of God", Vol. 2, Augsburg Fortress Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0800626826}}&lt;/ref&gt; being the most widely read and discussed. The earliest New Testament texts which refer to Jesus, [[Pauline epistles|Paul's letters]], are usually dated in the 50s CE. Since Paul records very little of Jesus' life and activities, these are of little help in determining facts about the life of Jesus, although they may contain references to information given to Paul from the eyewitnesses of Jesus.&lt;ref name="A Marginal Jew"&gt;[[John P. Meier]], ''[[A Marginal Jew]]'' Volume I, Doubleday, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] has shed light into the context of [[Roman Judea|1st century Judea]], noting the diversity of Jewish belief as well as shared expectations and teachings. For example, the expectation of the coming [[messiah]], the beatitudes of the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and much else of the early Christian movement are found to have existed within apocalyptic Judaism of the period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9d6gq_bR1AIC&amp;pg=PA28 The Dead Sea scrolls and Christian origins], [[Joseph Fitzmyer]], pp. 28ff&lt;/ref&gt; This has had the effect of centering [[Early Christianity]] much more within its Jewish roots than was previously the case. It is now recognised that [[Rabbinical Judaism]] and ''Early Christianity'' are only two of the many strands which survived until the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish revolt]] of 66 to 70 CE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E7DF1E3BF932A35757C0A96E958260 | work=The New York Times | title=BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Looking for Jesus and Jews in the Dead Sea Scrolls | first=Richard | last=Bernstein | date=April 1, 1998 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shanks, Hershel "[https://archive.org/details/understandingdea00shan Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls: A Reader From the Biblical Archaeology Review]", archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; see also [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism]].

Almost all historical critics agree that a historical figure named Jesus taught throughout the Galilean countryside c. 30 CE, was believed by his followers to have performed supernatural acts, and was sentenced to death by the Romans, possibly for insurrection.&lt;ref name="A Marginal Jew 2"&gt;Meier, John P.

====Historicity of the Gospels====
{{main|Historical reliability of the Gospels}}
Most modern scholars hold that the canonical [[Gospel]] accounts were written between 70 and 100 or 110 CE,&lt;ref name=r2&gt;Mack, Burton (1996), "Who Wrote the New Testament?: The Making of the Christian Myth", Harper One, {{ISBN|0060655186}}&lt;/ref&gt; four to eight decades after the crucifixion, although based on earlier traditions and texts, such as "[[Q document|Q]]", [[Logia]] or ''sayings gospels'', the passion account or other earlier literature (See [[List of Gospels]]).

Many scholars have pointed out that the [[Gospel of Mark]] shows signs of a lack of knowledge of geographical, political and religious matters in Judea in the time of Jesus. Thus, today the most common opinion is that the author is unknown and both geographically and historically at a distance to the narrated events&lt;ref&gt;Analecta Romana Instituti Danici, Danske selskab, Copenhagen, Denmark, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nineham, Dennis, ''Saint Mark'', Westminster Press, 1978, {{ISBN|0664213448}}, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Ehrman]], [https://archive.org/details/BartEhrman-TheNewTestament-AHistoricalIntroductionToTheEarly The New Testament.

====Historicity of Acts====
{{main|Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles}}

Archaeological inscriptions and other independent sources show that Acts contains some accurate details of 1st century society with regard to titles of officials, administrative divisions, town assemblies, and rules of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem. However, the historicity of the depiction of [[Paul the Apostle]] in Acts is contested. Acts describes Paul differently from how Paul describes himself, both factually and theologically.&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cain |first1=Seymour |last2=et al |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |chapter-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature/73440/The-Acts-of-the-Apostles?anchor=ref598122 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |language=en |chapter=Biblical literature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts differs with Paul's letters on important issues, such as the [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Law]], Paul's own [[Apostle (Christian)#The Apostle to the Gentiles: Paul of Tarsus|apostleship]], and his relation to the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem church]].&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;  Scholars generally prefer Paul's account over that in Acts.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Stephen|author-link=Stephen L Harris |title=Understanding the Bible: A Reader's Introduction |date=1985 |publisher=Mayfield Pub.

==Schools of archaeological and historical thought==

===Overview of academic views===
An educated reading of the biblical text requires knowledge of when it was written, by whom, and for what purpose. For example, many academics would agree that the [[Pentateuch]] was in existence some time shortly after the 6th century [[Common Era|BCE]], but they disagree about when it was written. Proposed dates vary from the 15th century BCE to the 6th century BCE. One popular hypothesis points to the reign of [[Josiah]] (7th century BCE). In this hypothesis, the events of, for example, [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] would have happened centuries before they were finally edited. This topic is expanded upon in [[dating the Bible]].

An important point to keep in mind is the [[documentary hypothesis]], which, using the biblical evidence itself, claims to demonstrate that our current version is based on older written sources that are lost. Although it has been modified heavily over the years, most scholars accept some form of this hypothesis. There have also been and are a number of scholars who reject it, for example [[Egyptologist]] [[Kenneth Kitchen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitchen|first1=Kenneth|title=On the Reliability of the Old Testament|date=2006|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|location=Grand Rapids, MI|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-8028-4960-1"&gt;
{{harvnb|Kitchen|2003|p={{page needed|date=March 2016}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Old Testament scholar]] [[Walter Kaiser, Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jashow.org/wiki/index.php/Exploding_the_J.E.D.P._Theory_-_The_Documentary_Hypothesis|title=Exploding the J.E.D.P.

Allis]], [[Gleason Archer]], [[John Sailhamer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sailhamer|first1=John|title=The Meaning of the Pentateuch: Revelation, Composition and Interpretation|date=2009|publisher=IVP Academic|location=Downers Grove, IL|pages=22–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruce Waltke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waltke|first1=Bruce|title=Genesis – A Commentary|date=2001|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maximalist–minimalist dichotomy===
There is great scholarly controversy on the historicity of events recounted in the Biblical narratives prior to the [[Babylonian captivity]] in the 6th century BCE.There is split between scholars who reject the Biblical account of Ancient Israel as fundamentally ahistorical, and those who accept it as a largely reliable source of history-termed biblical minimalists and biblical maximalists respectively. The major split of biblical scholarship into two opposing schools is strongly disapproved by non-fundamentalist biblical scholars, as being an attempt by conservative Christians to portray the field as a bipolar argument, of which only one side is correct.&lt;ref&gt;Spong, John Shelby (1992) ''Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism'' (Harper)&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the difference between the Maximalist and Minimalist has reduced, and a new school started with a work, ''The Quest for the Historical Israel: Debating Archaeology and the History of Early Israel'' by [[Israel Finkelstein]], [[Amihai Mazar]], and Brian B. Schmidt.&lt;ref name=r1 /&gt; This school argues that post-processual archaeology enables us to recognize the existence of a middle ground between Minimalism and Maximalism, and that both these extremes need to be rejected. Archaeology offers both confirmation of parts of the biblical record and also poses challenges to the interpretations made by some. The careful examination of the evidence demonstrates that the historical accuracy of the first part of the Old Testament is greatest during the reign of [[Josiah]]. Some feel that the accuracy diminishes the further backwards one proceeds from this date. This, they claim, would confirm that a major redaction of the texts seems to have occurred at about that date.

===Biblical minimalism===
{{Main|Biblical minimalism}}
The viewpoint sometimes called Biblical minimalism generally holds that the Bible is principally a [[theology|theological]] and [[apologetics|apologetic]] work, and all stories within it are of an [[aetiology|aetiological]] character.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The early stories are held to have a historical basis that was reconstructed centuries later, and the stories possess at most only a few tiny fragments of genuine historical memory–which by their definition are only those points which are supported by archaeological discoveries. In this view, all of the stories about the biblical patriarchs are fictional, and the patriarchs mere legendary eponyms to describe later historical realities. Further, biblical minimalists hold that the [[Israelites|twelve tribes of Israel]] were a later construction, the stories of King David and King Saul were modeled upon later Irano-Hellenistic examples, and that there is no archaeological evidence that the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united Kingdom of Israel]], which the Bible says that David and Solomon ruled over an empire from the Euphrates to [[Eilath]], ever existed. Archaeological evidence suggesting otherwise, such as the [[Mesha Stele]], is often rejected as allegorical.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

:"It is hard to pinpoint when the movement started but 1968 seems to be a reasonable date. During this year, two prize winning essays were written in Copenhagen; one by [[Niels Peter Lemche]], the other by [[Heike Friis]], which advocated a complete rethinking of the way we approach the Bible and attempt to draw historical conclusions from it."&lt;ref&gt;George Athas, 'Minimalism': The Copenhagen School of Thought in Biblical Studies, edited transcript of lecture, 3rd ed., University of Sydney, April 29, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In published books, one of the early advocates of the current school of thought known as biblical minimalism is Giovanni Garbini, ''Storia e ideologia nell'Israele antico'' (1986), translated into English as ''History and Ideology in Ancient Israel'' (1988).{{sfn|Garbini|1988}} In his footsteps followed [[Thomas L. Thompson]] with his lengthy ''Early History of the Israelite People: From the Written &amp; Archaeological Sources'' (1992) and,{{sfn|Thompson|1992}} building explicitly on Thompson's book, P. R. Davies' shorter work, ''In Search of 'Ancient Israel' '' (1992).{{sfn|Davies|1995}} In the latter, Davies finds historical Israel only in archaeological remains, biblical Israel only in scripture, and recent reconstructions of "ancient Israel" to be an unacceptable amalgam of the two. Thompson and Davies see the entire Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) as the imaginative creation of a small community of Jews at Jerusalem during the period which the Bible assigns to after the return from the Babylonian exile, from 539 BCE onward. [[Niels Peter Lemche]], Thompson's fellow faculty member at the [[University of Copenhagen]], also followed with several titles that show Thompson's influence, including ''The Israelites in history and tradition'' (1998). The presence of both Thompson and Lemche at the same institution has led to the use of the term "[[The Copenhagen School (theology)|Copenhagen school]]". The effect of biblical minimalism from 1992 onward was debate with more than two points of view.{{sfn|Mykytiuk|2010|p=76}}{{sfn|Brettler|2003|pp=1–21}}|&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mykytiuk|2012|pp=101–137}} see the section "Toward a Balanced View of Minimalism: A Summary of Published Critiques"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biblical maximalism===
There is great scholarly controversy on the historicity particularly of those events recounted in the Biblical narratives prior to the [[Babylonian captivity]] in the 6th century BCE. Regarding the debate over the historicity of ancient Israel, the maximalist position holds that the accounts of the United Monarchy and the early kings of Israel, [[David]] and [[Saul]], are to be taken as largely historical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/th/theory/theory-maximalists.html "Maximalists and Minimalists"], ''Livius.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decreasing conflict===
In 2001, [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] published ''[[The Bible Unearthed|The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts]]'' which advocated a view midway toward biblical minimalism and caused an uproar among many conservatives.{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001}} In the 25th anniversary issue of ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' (March/April 2001 edition), editor [[Hershel Shanks]] quoted several biblical scholars who insisted that minimalism was dying,&lt;ref&gt;Jack Cargill [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ht/34.3/cargill.html Ancient Israel in Western Civ Textbooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905162327/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ht/34.3/cargill.html |date=2005-09-05 }}. Quoting Amy Dockster Marcus about the minimalists: "The bottom line is that when it comes to the big picture, they are often right. Many of their ideas, once considered far-fetched, are now solidly mainstream concepts".&lt;/ref&gt; although leading minimalists deny this and a claim has been made "We are all minimalists now" (an allusion to [[We are all Keynesians now]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930192250/http://ajtp.iusb.edu/Back%20Issues/January1993CompleteIssue.PDF|title=''American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy'' Vol. 14, No. 1 January 1993|publisher=|accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The fact is that we are all minimalists—at least, when it comes to the patriarchal period and the settlement.

These days it is quite difficult to find anyone who takes this view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, until recently I could find no 'maximalist' history of Israel since Wellhausen. ... In fact, though, 'maximalist' has been widely defined as someone who accepts the biblical text unless it can be proven wrong.

In 2003, [[Kenneth Kitchen]], a scholar who adopts a more maximalist point of view, authored the book ''[[On the Reliability of the Old Testament]]''. Kitchen advocated the reliability of many (although not all) parts of the Torah and in no uncertain terms criticizes the work of Finkelstein and Silberman, to which Finkelstein has since responded.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Jennifer Wallace describes archaeologist Israel Finkelstein's view in her article "Shifting Ground in the Holy Land", appearing in ''Smithsonian Magazine'', May 2006:
{{quote|He ([[Israel Finkelstein]]) cites the fact—now accepted by most archaeologists—that many of the cities [[Joshua]] is supposed to have sacked in the late 13th century B.C. had ceased to exist by that time. [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]] was destroyed in the middle of that century, [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]] was abandoned before 2000 B.C. Even [[Jericho]], where Joshua is said to have brought the walls tumbling down by circling the city seven times with blaring trumpets, was destroyed in 1500 B.C. Now controlled by the Palestinian Authority, the [[Jericho]] site consists of crumbling pits and trenches that testify to a century of fruitless digging.{{sfn|Wallace|2006|p=unpaginated}}&lt;!--end quote--&gt;}}

However, despite problems with the archaeological record, some maximalists place Joshua in the mid-second millennium, at about the time the Egyptian Empire came to rule over Canaan, and not the 13th century as Finkelstein or Kitchen claim, and view the destruction layers of the period as corroboration of the biblical account. The destruction of Hazor in the mid-13th century is seen as corroboration of the biblical account of the later destruction carried out by Deborah and Barak as recorded in the [[Book of Judges]]. The location that Finkelstein refers to as "Ai" is generally dismissed as the location of the biblical Ai, since it was destroyed and buried in the 3rd millennium. The prominent site has been known by that name since at least Hellenistic times, if not before. Minimalists all hold that dating these events as contemporary are [[etiology|etiological]] explanations written centuries after the events they claim to report.

Both Finkelstein and Silberman do accept that David and Solomon were really existing persons (not kings but bandit leaders or hill country chieftains)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bol.com/nl/p/engelse-boeken/david-and-solomon/1001004002970474/index.html#product_description David and Solomon] Beschrijving. Bol.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Ostling [http://www.pe.com/lifestyles/stories/PE_Fea_Daily_D_david801.407fef9.html Was King David legend or fiction?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427181532/http://www.pe.com/lifestyles/stories/PE_Fea_Daily_D_david801.407fef9.html |date=2011-04-27 }} The Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt; from Judah about the 10th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkelstein| |Silberman|2006|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they do not assume that there was such a thing as United Monarchy with a capital in [[Jerusalem]].

{{quote|The Bible reports that Jehoshaphat, a contemporary of Ahab, offered manpower and horses for the northern kingdom's wars against the Arameans. He strengthened his relationship with the northern kingdom by arranging a diplomatic marriage: the Israelite princess Athaliah, sister or daughter of King Ahab, married Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat (2 Kings 8:18). The house of David in Jerusalem was now directly linked to (and apparently dominated by) the Israelite royalty of Samaria. In fact, we might suggest that this represented the north's takeover by marriage of Judah. Thus in the ninth century BCE—nearly a century after the presumed time of David—we can finally point to the historical existence of a great united monarchy of Israel, stretching from Dan in the north to Beer-sheba in the south, with significant conquered territories in Syria and Transjordan. But this united monarchy—a real united monarchy—was ruled by the Omrides, not the Davidides, and its capital was Samaria, not Jerusalem.|Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman&lt;ref name=realunitedmonarchy&gt;{{harvnb|Finkelstein|Silberman|2006|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others, such as [[David Ussishkin]], argue that those who follow the biblical depiction of a United Monarchy do so on the basis of limited evidence while hoping to uncover real archaeological proof in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Ussishkin, David, "Solomon's Jerusalem: The Texts and the Facts on the Ground", in Vaughn Andrew G. and Killebrew, Ann E. eds. (2003), ''Jerusalem in Bible and Archaeology: The First Temple Period'' (SBL Symposium Series 18; Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature)&lt;/ref&gt; Gunnar Lehmann suggests that there is still a possibility that David and Solomon were able to become local chieftains of some importance and claims that Jerusalem at the time was at best a small town in a sparsely populated area in which alliances of tribal kinship groups formed the basis of society. He goes on further to claim that it was at best a small regional centre, one of three to four in the territory of Judah and neither David nor Solomon had the manpower or the requisite social/political/administrative structure to rule the kind of empire described in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Lehrmann, Gunnar, "The United Monarchy in the Countryside: Jerusalem, Judah, and the Shephelah during the Tenth Century BCE", in Vaughn Andrew G. and Killebrew, Ann E. eds. (2003), ''Jerusalem in Bible and Archaeology: The First Temple Period'' (SBL Symposium Series 18; Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature)&lt;/ref&gt;

These views are strongly criticized by [[William G. Dever]],{{sfn|Dever|2001|p=160}} [[Helga Weippert]], [[Amihai Mazar]] and [[Amnon Ben-Tor]].

[[André Lemaire]] states in ''Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple''{{sfn|Shanks|1999|p=113}} that the principal points of the biblical tradition with Solomon as generally trustworthy, as does [[Kenneth Kitchen]], who argue that Solomon ruled over a comparatively wealthy "mini-empire", rather than a small city-state.

Recently, Finkelstein has joined with the more conservative [[Amihai Mazar]] to explore the areas of agreement and disagreement and there are signs the intensity of the debate between the so-called minimalist and maximalist scholars is diminishing.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{harvnb|Finkelstein|Mazar|Schmidt|2007|p={{page needed|date=March 2016}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is also taken by [[Richard S. Hess]],&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Richard S. (2007) ''Israelite Religions: An Archaeological and Biblical Survey'', Baker Academic, {{ISBN|0801027179}}&lt;/ref&gt; which shows there is in fact a plurality of views between maximalists and minimalists. Jack Cargill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ht/34.3/cargill.html |title=Jack Cargill – Ancient Israel in Western Civ Textbooks – The History Teacher, 34.3 |publisher= |accessdate=5 October 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120629123325/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ht/34.3/cargill.html |archivedate=29 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that popular textbooks not only fail to give readers up to date archaeological evidence, but that they also fail to correctly represent the diversity of views present on the subject. And Megan Bishop Moore and Brad E. Kelle provide an overview of the respective evolving approaches and attendant controversies, especially during the period from the mid-1980s through 2011, in their book ''Biblical History and Israel's Past''.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011}}

'''John Fearn''' (1768{{spaced ndash}} 3 December 1837) was a British philosopher.  
'''''Note''''': ''He has frequently been confused with [[John Fearn (whaler)|John Fearn]], the English whaling captain who was the first European to discover [[Nauru]] in 1798.''

Little is known about Fearn's early life.  He was probably born in May 1768 (baptised 11 May) in [[Chatham, Kent]] &lt;ref name=PR&gt;Parish Register quoted in {{cite web|title=England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975, database, FamilySearch |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:N6V5-ZL4|accessdate=4 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent some years as an officer in the [[Royal Navy]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ZFDantj49PYC&amp;pg=PR21&amp;lpg=PR21&amp;dq=JOHN+FEARN+PHILOSOPHER&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Krz2bK1ttj&amp;sig=BKBXtrh8CUn-9UTANsapQiyt-iM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-GocVe-SIMvt8gXkw4CgDw&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=JOHN%20FEARN%20PHILOSOPHER&amp;f=false ''Philosophical Works of Lady Mary Shepherd'', Volume 2].

He was particularly interested in ocular phenomena and visual perception. He was a friend of [[Samuel Parr]] and [[Basil Montagu]].&lt;ref name=ox&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095812746 Oxford Index]. Retrieved 2 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jose Maria Valverde.jpg|thumbnail|José María Valverde in 1980]]
'''José María Valverde Pacheco''' (26 January 1926, [[Valencia de Alcántara]] (Cáceres) – 6 June 1996, [[Barcelona]]) was a Spanish poet, essayist, literary critic, philosophy historian, and Spanish translator.

== Biography ==
Valverde was born in [[Extremadura]], but spent his childhood and teenage years in [[Madrid]]. While still a student at the Instituto Ramiro de Maeztu he published his first book, ''Man of God: Psalms, elegies and prayers'', which was funded by the Institute. Although [[Damaso Alonso]] tempted him to study philology, Valverde pursued Philosophy; his doctorate included a thesis on [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]'s philosophy of language. That same year he married Pilar Gefaell, with whom he had five children, including [[Mariana Valverde]], a Professor of Criminology at the University of Toronto.

He wrote in various magazines: ''La Estafeta Literaria'', ''Escorial'', ''Works and Days'', ''Root'', and the ''Ensign and Journal of Aesthetic Ideas'', at times using the pseudonym "Gambrinus". His essays were later collected in ''The Art of the Article (1949–1993)'' (Barcelona, 1994). He also published in poetic magazines including Garcilaso, Espadaña, Proel. Between 1950 and 1955, Valverde lived in [[Rome]], where he was reader of Spanish at [[Sapienza University of Rome]] and at the Spanish Institute, and met [[Benedetto Croce]]. At age 29 in 1956, he obtained the chair of Aesthetics at the [[University of Barcelona]]. This setting and his experiences as a professor inspired "The conquest of the world" (1960). He participated in the literary magazines of the time and in numerous periodicals, which published much of his thinking. He himself said he was a poet rather than a philosopher, and not vice versa. He was devoted to the study of history of ideas. Collaborating with [[Martí de Riquer i Morera]] in an ambitious History of literature (1957, greatly expanded later) and writing a Life and death of ideas: small stories thoughts (1981), he launched his award-winning translations of classics of literature in English and German. With a clear social and political commitment, Christian and anti-Franco, he supported the popular cause in Central America ([[Cuba]], the [[Sandinistas]]: relating to exiled [[Nicaraguan]] poets Julio Ycaza, Luis Rocha and Fernando Silva.) For political reasons (solidarity with teachers [[Enrique Tierno Galván]], José Luis Aranguren and [[Agustin Garcia Calvo]] who were expelled from the University of Madrid by Franco), he resigned his professorship in 1964 and went into exile. He is credited with the now famous phrase, written on the blackboard in farewell: "Nulla aesthetica sine ethica. Ergo apaga y vámonos." He went to the United States, where he was professor of Hispanic and comparative literature (University of Virginia, McMaster) and then to Canada where he was a professor of Spanish literature at [[Trent University]]. This experience is part of his poem "The Tower of Babel falls on the poet":

&lt;poem&gt;
"Mature in age and poetry
you moved to a foreign speaking country,
and it is not living. What they say here,
ia easy as breathing, easy, rich, accurate,
you're trying to mimic them with effort,
and hear your voice, ridiculous and strange,
fail as a child always right here,
end up saying something not yours.
Now I am alien to the landscape:
do not talk to you: to the bird and the tree
and the river spared you the legends
wrap their names here-in you tags.
In vain you smile to others
polite, and even friends, cheering
from the language in which they are the masters:
fails to love them: you forget:
the depths of your spirit does not beat
does not live in the language that is your history."
(Ser de palabra, 1973).
&lt;/poem&gt;

Before returning to Spain, he published in 1971 Teachings of Age (Poetry 1945–1970), a volume collecting the first six books of poems. He returned to Spain and his professorship in 1975 (according to some), in 1977 according to others. The editorial Trotta in Madrid has undertaken the publication of his Complete Works, which led to his writing four volumes: the first of Poetry (1998), the second and third of aesthetics and literary theory, and the fourth in the history of ideas. He died in Barcelona in 1996, at seventy years of a terminal illness, while devoting his energies to investigate the latest work of Kierkegaard.

== Work ==

In his critical work is worth mentioning Studies on the poetic word (1952), Humboldt and the philosophy of language (1955), History of literature (1957), Letters to a skeptical priest in modern art (1959), Life and death of ideas: small stories thoughts (1981), Aesthetic Dictionary or monographs on [[Azorín]] (1971), [[Antonio Machado]] (1975), [[James Joyce]] (1978 and 1982), or [[Nietzsche]].

Of importance are his German translations ([[Hölderlin]], [[Rilke]], [[Goethe]], [[Novalis]], [[Brecht]], [[Christian Morgenstern]], [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]) and English (theater: complete Shakespeare prose,  likewise those of [[Charles Dickens]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Saul Bellow]], [[Thomas Merton]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Emily Dickinson]], or Joyce's [[Ulysses (novel)]], for which he received the Translation Prize Fray Luis de León, 1977). In 1960 he received the same award for a collection of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]. In 1990 he was also awarded National Award for the work of a translator. Also translated some poems of [[Constantine Cavafy]] from Modern Greek, the New Testament from Ancient Greek, and Romano Guardini from Italian.

He prepared, in addition, critical editions of Antonio Machado, one of his favorite authors (New Songs, In an apocryphal songbook and [[Juan de Mairena]]) and Azorín (Forgotten Items and Peoples), anthologies of general Spanish and Latin American poetry and specially Luis Felipe Vivanco, [[Miguel de Unamuno]] and [[Ernesto Cardenal]]. The problems of contemporary art in his book resonated in Letters to a skeptical priest in modern art (1959).

He was especially concerned with a particular stream of [[existentialism]]: Christian man in what he called, with [[Damaso Alonso]] in the prologue to a book of his, uprooted poetry. His early poems have a religious theme. Then he introduced new issues in his poetry, more human, closer to Marxist approaches. It has been said that he was a Christian Marxist, with an approach close to the thesis [[Liberation Theology]]. His work is characterized by a marked humanism with intimate touches, making him one of the brightest figures of Spanish poetry scene.

A poet of organic books, where the whole is greater than the sum of the constituent poems, his style is characterized by simplicity and expressive language (almost conversational), always looking for openness, purity and precision, without unnecessary rhetoric, in the tradition of [[Antonio Machado]]. That desire led him to remove numerous poems from his latest compilation, making it  successively smaller. Some of this can be seen in his famous poem about the hanged [[François Villon]]. He preferred to express himself in Arte Mayor and the [[alexandrine]].

He received inter alia, the National Poetry Award in 1949, the Critics Award in 1962 and the Ciutat de Barcelona Prize for his Collected poems 1945–1990. In poetry, his books include Hombre de Dios in 1945, La espera in 1949,
Versos del domingo in 1954, Voces y acompañamientos para San Mateo in 1959, La conquista de este mundo in 1960, Años inciertos in 1970, and Ser de palabra in 1976.

His personal archive is located in the [[Pavelló de la República CRAI Library]] – University of Barcelona . It consists of published and not published writings, handwritten translations and notes; writer's personal papers, letters sent and/or received by José María Valverde, press clippings, tributes and condolence letters written to the Valverde family.

''Kumbhaka'' is the pause between an inhale and exhale. According to B.K. S. Iyengar in ''Light on Yoga'', the "retention or holding the breath, a state where there is no inhalation or exalation".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Light on Yoga|last=Iyengar|first=B.K.S.|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1979|isbn=0-8052-1031-8|location=New York|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Iyengar also notes that in some yoga texts the term is used generically to indicate all three parts of the breath: inhale, exhale, and pauses. Along with the inhale and exhale, the kumbhaka is essential to any practice of [[pranayama]]. To further clarify the teachings of ''pranayama'' the k''humbhaka'' which follows the exhale is called the ''bahya kumbhaka'' and that which follows the inhale is called the ''antara kumbhaka''. (''Bahya'' means outer/exterior. ''Antara'' means inner/interior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;)

|-
|Antar Kumbhaka
|It is ceasing of breath when the [[inhalation]] (or Puraka) is complete and the [[lungs]] are filled up with air. In this kumbhaka, inhalation is recommended to be slightly forceful to take more air than normal and ceasing it as per one's ability.
|-
|Bahya Kumbhaka
|It is ceasing of breath when the [[exhalation]] (or Rechak) is complete. It is also recommended to exhale more than normal and then cease it as per one's ability.
|-
|Sahit Kumbhaka
|It is the kumbhaka performed with inhalation or exhalation.
|-
|Kevali Kumbhaka
|Inhalation or exhalation is not required or not focussed in exercising Kevali Kumbhaka. It is the extreme stage of Kumbhaka which is attained only by continuous long term pranayama and kumbhak exercises.
|}

==Importance==

Respiration includes [[inhalation]] and [[exhalation]]. In between these two processes there is a very minute gap or pause (normally in milliseconds) which is usually not noticed and it recurs, i.e., inhalation-pause-exhalation-pause-inhalation.... and it continues. The maximum gap or pause is observed in the state of [[Human relaxation|rest]]. Kumbhak enforces to increase the pause by ceasing the breath routinely and continuously by various types of pranayama and kumbhaka exercises.

It has been said that ''It is being observed that the more time spent for pranayama (and kumbhaka); the more is the concentration and the better is the control over mind.'' Various ancient yogis (expert in yoga and pranayama) noticed the importance of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and its [[correlation]] with activities of mind and vital forces. [[Aging]] is also seen proportional to frequency of respiration or [[respiratory rate]], i.e., frequency of inhalation and exhalation in one minute. Medical science recorded normal respiratory rate in humans as 12-16 breaths per minute with life span of 70–80 years. These figures may vary due to geographical, communal and other distribution factors.

Recent researches in the field of Bahir-Kumbhaka demonstrate the impact on [[cerebral circulation]], with an increase in end diastolic velocity (EDV), mean flow velocity (MFV) along with [[pulsatility index]] (PI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nivethitha|first=L.|last2=Mooventhan|first2=A.|last3=Manjunath|first3=N.

==Immortality==
[[Aging]] is proportional to respiratory rate (excluding exceptions), e.g.,
*Mouse: Respiratory rate = 60–230/min and Life span = 1.5–3.0 years [http://research.uiowa.edu/]
*Rabbit: Respiratory rate = 30–60/min and Life span = 5.0–6.0 years [http://research.uiowa.edu/]
*Monkey: Respiratory rate = 30–50/min and Life span = 20–30 years [http://www.uthsc.edu/]
*Human: Respiratory rate = 12–16/min and Life span = 70–80 years
*Whales: Respiratory rate = 3–5/min [http://www.bio.davidson.edu/] and Life span = more than 100 years

Though the level of consciousness varies from species to [[species]], it is seen highest in humans where conscious mind can provoke to perform activities and exercises as per wishes and this voluntary performance is not up to such an extent in any other species and consequently all other species cannot cease their breath as and when desired (voluntarily). Some species (e.g., whales) can take enormous air and cease it for a long time but that is [[wikt:spontaneous|spontaneous]] requirement and involuntary;  and it is the necessity for them to [[wikt:survive|survive]] this way.

Practicing kumbhaka for a long time increases endurance of physiological as well as psychological structure of an individual. Continuous and long term practicing increases the hold or control on breath up to an extent where it reaches to its extreme stage (Kevali Kumbhak) and the respiration is ceased permanently unless desired to get into normal state.

Aging is proportional to metabolism which in turn is proportional to respiratory rate. Metabolism lowers down as the respiratory rate decreases and this helps prevent aging or at least lowers down the process. It has not been recorded scientifically whether kevali kumbhaka can increase age (or can make immortality a fact) by lowering down the basic reactions which support life, however, various [[yoga sutras]] and [[religious scripture]]s define [[samadhi]] and [[immortality]] an approachable aspiration for determined individuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15721">'''Libel tourism''' is a term, first coined by [[Geoffrey Robertson]], to describe [[forum shopping]] for [[libel]] suits. It particularly refers to the practice of pursuing a case in [[England and Wales]], in preference to other jurisdictions, such as the United States, which provide more extensive defenses for those accused of making derogatory statements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaljournalist.org/stories/2004/07/01/libel-tourism/ Libel Tourism Chills Investigative Journalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124103658/http://globaljournalist.org/stories/2004/07/01/libel-tourism/ |date=2010-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A critic of [[English defamation law]], journalist [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]], attributes the practice to the introduction of [[no win no fee]] agreements, the presumption that derogatory statements are false, the difficulty of establishing [[fair comment]] and "the caprice of juries and the malice of judges."&lt;ref name=wheatcroft&gt;{{cite news
|title= The worst case scenario

|accessdate= 2008-04-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheatcroft contrasts this with United States law since the ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'' case. "Any American public figure bringing an action now has to prove that what was written was not only untrue but published maliciously and recklessly."&lt;ref name=wheatcroft/&gt;

Two other critics of English defamation law, the US lawyers Samuel A. Abady and Harvey Silverglate, have cited the example of [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]]&amp;ndash;[[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] businessman [[Khalid bin Mahfouz]], who by the time of his death in 2009,  had threatened suit more than 40 times in England against those who accused him of funding terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate= 2008-04-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahfouz also took legal action in Belgium, France and Switzerland against those repeating the accusations. George W. Bush advisor [[Richard Perle]] threatened to sue investigative reporter [[Seymour Hersh]] in London, because of a series of critical articles Hersh had written about him.&lt;ref name="Berlins"&gt;[[Marcel Berlins|Berlins, Marcel]]. Index on Censorship, July 2004, Vol. 33 Issue 3, p18-20&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 American actress [[Kate Hudson]] won a libel action in England against the British edition of the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' magazine after it published an article suggesting she had an eating disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of cases involving US citizens being sued in English courts led to new laws in both countries. In the United States, the [[SPEECH Act]] unanimously passed the US Congress, which makes foreign defamation judgements [[unenforceable]] in US courts if they don't meet US free speech standards. In England and Wales, the [[Defamation Act 2013]] requires plaintiffs to show that England is the proper jurisdiction to hear a case when the defendant does not live in England or Wales.

==Case law==

===Berezovsky v Michaels===
{{main|Berezovsky v Michaels}}
In 2000, the [[House of Lords]] gave [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] and [[Nikolai Glushkov]] permission to sue [[Forbes]] for libel in the English courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldjudgmt/jd000511/bere-1.htm |title=Judgments - Berezovsky v.

Michaels and Others (Consolidated Appeals) |publisher=publications.parliament.uk  |date=May 11, 2000 |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the case was settled when ''Forbes'' offered a partial retraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/1632864 |title=Shuddup |work=[[The Economist]] |date=13 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The following statement appended to the article on the Forbes website summarises: 'On 6 March 2003 the resolution of the case was announced in the High Court in London. FORBES stated in open court that (1) it was not the magazine's intention to state that Berezovsky was responsible for the murder of Listiev, only that he had been included in an inconclusive police investigation of the crime; (2) there is no evidence that Berezovsky was responsible for this or any other murder; (3) in light of the English court's ruling, it was wrong to characterize Berezovsky as a mafia boss.

===The Ehrenfeld Case===
{{further|Funding Evil#Libel controversy}}
Khalid bin Mahfouz and two members of his family sued [[Rachel Ehrenfeld]], an Israeli-born writer and United States citizen over her 2003 book on [[terrorist financing]], ''[[Funding Evil]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Alyssa A. Lappen, "[http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=27641 The fly in the bin Mahfouz ointment]", Aug. 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which asserted that Mahfouz and his family provided financial support to Islamic terrorist groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/20/business/libel21.php Britain, a destination for "libel tourism"]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was not published in Britain, although 23 copies of her book had been purchased online through web sites registered in the UK, and excerpts from the book had been published globally on the ABC News web site. Ehrenfeld was advised by English lawyer [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]] to claim that the suit in England violated her First Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution and chose not to defend the action. Instead, she countersued in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Lappen, "[http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=27641 The fly in the bin Mahfouz ointment]", Aug. 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2005 judgment Justice [[David Eady|Eady]] criticised Dr. Ehrenfeld for attempting to cash in on the libel action without being prepared to defend it on its merits and specifically rebutted her suggestion of forum shopping. Eady ruled that Ehrenfeld should pay £10,000 to each claimant plus costs, apologize for false allegations and destroy existing copies of her book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.binmahfouz.info/news_20050503_full.html Full text of the High Court judgment], 2005-05-03&lt;/ref&gt;

Eady has been [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/oct/19/eady-libel-tourism-free-speech internationally criticized] for his perceived bias in the case and his general restrictive approach to free speech. Additionally, the libel laws which were applied are under scrutiny in England, where calls for libel law reform have increased since Ehrenfeld's case. Analyzing English libel law, the [http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/hrcommittee/ireland2008.html United Nations Human Rights Committee] cautioned that: "practical application of the law of libel has served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest, adversely affecting the ability of scholars and journalists to publish their work, including through the phenomenon known as "libel tourism." The advent of the internet and the international distribution of foreign media also create the danger that a State party's unduly restrictive libel law will affect freedom of expression worldwide on matters of valid public interest."

==Laws addressing libel tourism==

===England and Wales===
On January 1st, 2014 a law was enacted ([[Defamation Act 2013]]) requiring plaintiffs who bring actions in the courts of England and Wales alleging libel by defendants who do not live in Europe to demonstrate that the court is the most appropriate place to bring the action. Serious harm to an individual's reputation or serious financial harm to a corporation must also be proven. Good faith belief that a disclosure was in the public interest was made a defense.&lt;ref name=NYT42513&gt;{{cite news|title=Libel Cases Now Harder to Bring in England|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/world/europe/new-law-makes-suing-for-libel-harder-in-england.html|accessdate=April 26, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 25, 2013|author=Sarah Lyall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====Federal====
The Free Speech Protection Act of 2008 and 2009 were both bills aimed at addressing libel tourism by barring U.S. courts from enforcing libel judgments issued in foreign courts against U.S. residents, if the speech would not be libelous under American law. These protections were passed in the 2010 [[SPEECH Act]] which passed unanimously in both the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] before being signed by US President [[Barack Obama]] on August 10, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecuttingedgenews.com/index.php?article=12432|title=Congress Unites to Pass Bill Protecting American Authors and Publishers|author=Meisel, Aylana|publisher=[[The Cutting Edge]]|date=2010-08-03|accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2010/aug/11/medialaw-barack-obama|title=Obama seals off US journalists and authors from Britain's libel laws|author=Greenslade, Roy|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2010-08-11|accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New York====

In late December 2007, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, based on a decision by the New York State Court of Appeals, ruled that the state's current "long-arm" statutes governing business transactions did not give it jurisdiction to protect author Ehrenfeld.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/decisions/dec07/174opn07.pdf], N.Y. Court of Appeals ruling, Dec. 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Court noted, however, that if the law were to change, Ehrenfeld could go back to court.

On Jan. 13, 2008, two members of the [[New York State Legislature]], [[New York State Assembly|Assemblyman]] [[Rory I. Lancman]] (D-Queens) and [[New York State Senate|Senator]] [[Dean Skelos]] (R-LI), introduced a "Libel Terrorism Protection Act" in both legislative houses (bills no. A09652 and S 6676-B)&lt;ref&gt;Alyssa A. Lappen, "[http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=24649 America's First Amendment lifeline]", ''Human Events'', Jan. 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; to amend the New York civil procedures in response to the Ehrenfeld case. The bill passed the New York State legislature on a rare unanimous vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rcfp.org/newsitems/index.php?i=4878 |title=New York strikes back against libel tourism |author=Matthew Pollack |date=April 1, 2008 |work=Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 29, 2008 Gov.

====California====

In October 2009, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law protections against libel tourism (California's Libel Tourism Act) that took effect January 1, 2010. The Act provides that California courts shall not recognize a foreign-country judgment if "the judgment includes recovery for a claim of defamation unless the court determines that the defamation law applied by the foreign court provided at least as much protection for freedom of speech and the press as provided by both the United States and California Constitutions" (CCCP sec. 1716(c)(9)) and other protections. (See Cal. Code of Civil Procedure sections 1716 and 1717, as amended by Chapter 579, Statutes of 2009 (SB 320 - Corbett).) (http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_0301-0350/sb_320_bill_20091011_chaptered.pdf.) The law received significant bi-partisan support. (See CA Leg Counsel bill/vote records)

====Illinois====

In August 2008, Illinois enacted a Libel Tourism law that is similar to the statute passed in New York. (See 735 ILL. COMP. STAT 5/12-621 (b)(7) (2009); 735 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/2-209 (b-5) (2009).)

====Florida====

In May 2009, Florida also enacted a Libel Tourism law similar to the law passed in New York. (Florida Statutes 55.605 (2)(h); 55.6055)

'''Linguistic empathy''' in [[theoretical linguistics]] is the "point of view" in an [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] utterance by which a participant is [[binding (linguistics)|bound]] with or in the event or state that he/she describes in that sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kuno S.|year=1987|title=Functional syntax: Anaphora, discourse, and empathy|location=Chicago|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|ISBN=978-0-226-46201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oshima DY|year=2007|url=http://davidyo.drivehq.com/docs/empinv.pdf|title=Syntactic direction and obviation as empathy-based phenomena: a typological approach|journal=Linguistics|volume=45|pages=727–763|DOI=10.1515/LING.2007.022}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oshima DY|year=2007|title=On empathic and logophoric binding|journal=Research on Language &amp; Computation|volume=5|issue=1|pages=19–35|DOI=10.1007/s11168-006-9020-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example is found with the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] verbs yaru and kureru. These both share the same essential [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] and [[case frame]]. But they differ in that yaru expresses when the action is looked at from the point of view of the referent of the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] or the neutral (objective) point of view, whereas kureru is used when the event is described from the point of view of the referent of the [[Dative case|dative object]]. 

While present in many languages including [[English language|English]] it is particularly prominent in some such as Japanese.

The concept has no connection with [[empathy]] in terms of attributing mental states to others or sympathizing with their situation. 

==The phenomena==

The basic idea of linguistic empathy is that sentences can provide information about the speaker's point of view, from which they describe a state of affairs. This information can be expressed as concerning the speaker's identification with a participant", "camera angle", and "point of view". 

For example, in English, "then John hit his brother" is more acceptable than "then John's brother was hit by him". The former shows the speaker's empathy with John is greater than with his brother (John's brother). In contrast, in the latter, John's brother is the subject and him (John) is the by-agent. Thus, since the speaker's empathy with the subject, John's brother, is less than with him (John), then John's brother was hit by him is less acceptable than the former phrase.
&lt;!-- 
It has been suggested that there are three types of linguistic point of view. In addition to empathy, there is logophoricity, and the spatio-temporal ("deictic") perspective. --&gt;

[[File:Margaret Morganroth Gullette Image.jpg|thumbnail|Margaret Morganroth Gullette Image]]
'''Margaret Morganroth Gullette''' (born 1941), a Resident Scholar at the Women's Studies Research Center at Brandeis University, is a cultural critic who calls herself an age critic and theorist. She is a prize-winning writer of nonfiction, an essayist, feminist, and activist. Her contributions to the field of [[cultural studies]] of age include four books, the latest of which is ''Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America'' (2011). Other books of Gullette's that have been influential (in humanistic and cultural gerontology, history, literary and cultural criticism, sociology and anthropology, performance and film studies, life writing and narrative theory, fashion studies, and feminist health activism) include ''Aged by Culture'' (2004), ''Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife'' (1997); and ''Safe at Last in the Middle Years: The Invention of the Midlife Progress Novel''  (1988).

== Early life and education==
Margaret Morganroth was born in Brooklyn, NY, the first child of Betty Morganroth and Martin Morganroth. She was educated through high school at public schools and received scholarships to go to college and graduate school. Morganroth Gullette holds a B.A. magna cum laude [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from Radcliffe College, a M.A. from University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University.

==Career==
Before becoming a Scholar in the Women's Studies Research Center in 1996, she had previously worked at the Harvard-Danforth Center for Teaching and Learning and had been a visiting scholar at Harvard; the Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe; Northeastern University; Wellesley Center for Research on Women. At the Danforth (now Bok) Center, she edited ''The Art and Craft of Teaching''. She continues to publish in the field of pedagogy and education. [citation needed]

Working in the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe, Gullette found a lost novel by the late nineteenth-century English feminist, Mona Caird, ''The Daughters of Danaus'', and wrote an introduction for the Feminist Press reissue. Early in the feminist second wave, she published a feminist children's book called ''The Lost Bellybutton'' (1976). [citation needed]

She was invited to be the George A. Miller Visiting Professor, at the Center for Advanced Studies, University of Illinois (Urbana/ Champaign), in the spring of 2000. She is an Advisory Editor to the new journal, ''Age, Culture, Humanities: An Interdisciplinary Journal'', and on the book series, Aging Studies in Europe  (LIT Verlag).  She is on the Advisory Committee of the European Network on Aging (ENAS).  She was on the Advisory Committee of the ''Journal of Aging, the Humanities, and the Arts'', 2006 2010 and co editor, Age Studies Series, University Press of Virginia, 1993 1999.

== Major ideas ==
Mike Hepworth, the late British cultural gerontologist (1957–2012), in a review of Gullette's work through 1999, calls her "one of America's foremost critics  of the concept of ageing as a universal and comprehensive process of decline. She is a formidable critic of biological essentialism, defender of [[social constructionism]], and opponent of 'middle ageism'" (Hepworth 1999, Abstract), and the author of an "increasingly influential range of publications on the social construction of ageing" (Hepworth 1999, 139) and the life course in the United States.  Gullette emerged during the 1990s and beyond as "the primary theorist and practitioner of what she called 'age studies'" (Cole and Ray 2010, 17).  Gullette named the field of "age studies" in 1993 (Gullette 1993, 45–46). The term is used by the Modern Language Association and in the humanities in preference to "aging studies."

"Her principal thesis is that we are aged by culture. What she means is that much of what we experience as we get older is not the ineluctable consequence of biological ageing . . . but is socially and culturally contingent. American society, she contends, has become a rich terrain on which the social and cultural exclusion of people as they age can take place and where the ideology of ageing can flourish" (Tulle 2006: 127). Age studies tries to understand age and aging as complex, intersectional social and psychological constructions, and also as a set of mediated relationships among people located at different phases of the life course.

"Age studies sees 'age' and 'aging' in culture as resulting as much from ideologies as from biology" (Ball 2006, 214).  Gullette has said that she offers a radical social constructionism that pushes "'the natural' out of context after context" (Gullette 1997 246 n42). "Neither Featherstone and Hepworth nor Gullette denied the existence of bodily ageing, although their work has at times been interpreted as coming near to doing so, with their emphasis on the cultural constitution of the body. . . . As a result, their work has been criticised by those who see it as endorsing a false dualism of the body and the self." (Twigg, 2007)

:: "Cultural critics like Gullette (1997, 1999) and Featherstone and Hepworth (1991) have traced the ways in which culture imposes negative meanings on the bodies of older people, which are then read back as the source of those meanings. For Gullette, we are aged not by our bodies but by culture; and the response should be one of challenge and resistance, as the [sub]title of her [1997] book [''Declining to Decline''], ''Cultural Combat'', makes clear" (Twigg, 2007, 298).

"Margaret Morganroth Gullette has documented ways in which the pervasive ageism of Western cultures is often coded into a narrative structure that associates old age with inevitable decline and decay. Although this 'decline ideology' might seem to work against the futurist assumption of redemptive hope, Gullette explains that we are trained to assume the decline of the old in order to make room for the more highly valued young. To counter this tendency, Gullette urges the proliferation of 'progress narratives,' which project 'a moving image of the self through its past and onward to its better future' (Port 2012, 5–6 ) One of her theoretical moves has been to undermine the binary between "progress narrative," automatically applied to children and younger people; and "decline narrative," automatically applied to people who have aged past midlife.

Gullette's term "age autobiography" is a call for individual authors to write more knowledgeably and critically about the mediated forces that insinuate themselves into our sense of "aging."  "And once we begin to think age, a more mysterious and intangible project emerges: to discover what our own culture is serving up for us, and what each of us has consumed or resisted" (Gullette 1993, 46). "The term itself ["the master narrative of aging"] was coined by Margaret Morganroth Gullette and is designed to identify a recognizable ensemble of cultural practices. . . " (Kunow 2011, 26).  The "master narrative of decline" requires a single self going through a linear trajectory, while "the portmanteau self" is "an active concept of aging as self narrated experience, the conscious, ongoing story of one's age identity"  (Gullette 1997: 220). Fragments of Gullette's own age autobiography appear in many of her nonfiction works. Cynthia Port singles out "one powerful essay [in which] Gullette argues that the fashion system teaches us to detach ourselves from and then discard clothes and other no longer fashionable commodities as a means of training ourselves for our own obsolescence in old age":  "The Other End of the Fashion Cycle: Practicing Loss, Learning Decline" (Port 2012, n26).

Gullette has been called  "one of gerontology's few public intellectuals," who demonstrates "how a scholar works to change the minds of general readers about aging and ageism" (Ray and Cole 2010: 8).   "The whole point, as Gullette (1988, 1993, 1997) has vividly shown in her analyses of fictional representations of ageing, is to discover how our personal ideas about ageing (positive/ negative/ ambiguous) are shaped by our culture and are therefore open to the possibility of change" (Hepworth 2000, 3). Convinced that our terminology about age is impoverished, she encourages the use of terms like "aging-past-youth," aging-into-the-middle years," and "aging-into-old age" (Gullette 1998, 3–44). She argues in several books (1997, 2004, 2011) that collective sociopolitical changes are necessary.

''Staging Age'', edited by Valerie Barnes Lipscomb and Leni Marshall, gives credit to Gullette's work in establishing the field of age studies, and advancing concepts about how age can be considered a performance (Lipscomb and Marshall 2010, 1–3). She invented the term "middle ageism" (Gullette 1998, 3–44)  to name the cluster of discriminations suffered by people in their middle years, from job discrimination to "Boomer-bashing" and decline discourse about sexuality, looks, and intellectual and cognitive competence. Other concepts developed by Gullette—such as "age ideology," "being aged by culture," and the use of "progress narrative" as a way out of the binary between "positive aging" and "decline narrative"—have been adopted by scholars in a range of disciplines.

Gullette's concepts and formulations have been disseminated through a number of chapters and essays or excerpts that have appeared in anthologies, including 
''A Guide to Humanistic Studies in Aging'' (2010), 
''Narratives of Life: Mediating Age'' (Munich 2009),

== Critical praise ==
"In breadth of vision, scholarly integrity, and the sheer exhilaration of her writing, Gullette's work is essential reading for all who wish to understand the origins of the transformation of midlife in our times and the possibility of real changes in attitudes to ageing--personal and social--under postmodern global capitalism" (Hepworth 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;143). "Gullette's gift for storytelling enthralls readers" (Achenbaum, 2011, 723). Gullette's chapter, 'Overcoming the Terror of Forgetfulness,' in ''Agewise'' was called "the best essay on memory loss that I have read. Based partly on the author's experiences with her mother, it reveals her deep compassion and insight" (Cruikshank 2011, 26).

== Honors and awards ==
''Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America'' (2011) won a 2012 Eric Hoffer Book Prize. ''Aged by Culture'' (2004), was chosen as a Noteworthy Book of the year by the ''Christian Science Monitor''. It was nominated for a Pulitzer and received an Honorable Mention from the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights. ''Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife'' (1997) won the Emily Toth award in 1998 for the best feminist book on American popular culture.

Gullette has held fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies. She held a Bunting Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute in 1986–87 while finishing ''Safe at Last in the Middle Years''.

Her essay, "The Contagion of Euphoria," won the [[Daniel Singer Millennial Prize]] in 2008. Other essays, frequently cited as notable in ''Best American Essays'', have appeared in many literary and cultural quarterlyes, including ''Kenyon Review'', ''Michigan Quarterly Review'', ''American Scholar'', and ''Yale Review''; and in scholarly journals like ''Feminist Studies'', ''Representations'', ''New Political Science'', ''Profession'', and the ''Journal of the History of Sexuality''.  Quotations from her books appear in ''The Quotable Woman: The First Five Thousand Years'' (2010).  She is a long-term member of PEN-America, to which she was nominated by Carolyn Heilbrun and Alix Kates Shulman.  In 2005 she won the Virginia Liebeler Biennial Grant for Mature Women in Letters from the National League of American Pen Women.

In 2012 Gullette won the Marigold "Ideas for Good" Prize, which carries an award of $5000, for her work as the co-founder and director of development for The Free High School for Adults, San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, the sister city of Newton, MA, where she lives. She has been visiting Nicaragua since 1989, finding funding for adult education programs there.

It is not a specific doctrine or school (and thus should not be confused with ''[[Modernism]]''), although there are certain assumptions common to much of it, which helps to distinguish it from earlier philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2=Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | date = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th and early 20th centuries roughly mark the beginning and the end of modern philosophy. How much of the [[Renaissance]] should be included is a matter for dispute; likewise modernity may or may not have ended in the twentieth century and been replaced by [[postmodernity]]. How one decides these questions will determine the scope of one's use of "modern philosophy."

==Modern Western philosophy==
{{also|Early modern philosophy|Late modern philosophy}}
[[File:Franciscus Suarez, S.I. (1548-1617).jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Francisco Suárez]], known as the bridge figure between the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and modern philosophy&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/suarez/&lt;/ref&gt;]]
How much of Renaissance intellectual history is part of modern philosophy is disputed:&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]] (ed.), ''The Future for Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 44 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[15th century philosophy|Early Renaissance]] is often considered less modern and more medieval compared to the later [[16th-century philosophy|High Renaissance]]. By the 17th and 18th centuries the major figures in [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]] were roughly divided into two main groups. The "[[Rationalism|Rationalists]]," mostly in France and Germany, argued all knowledge must begin from certain "[[Innatism|innate ideas]]" in the mind. Major rationalists were [[Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Nicolas Malebranche]].  The "[[Empiricism|Empiricists]]," by contrast, held that knowledge must begin with sensory experience.  Major figures in this line of thought are [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] (These are retrospective categories, for which Kant is largely responsible.) Ethics and political philosophy are usually not subsumed under these categories, though all these philosophers worked in [[ethics]], in their own distinctive styles. Other important figures in [[political philosophy]] include [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

In the late eighteenth century [[Immanuel Kant]] set forth a groundbreaking philosophical system which claimed to bring unity to rationalism and empiricism.  Whether or not he was right, he did not entirely succeed in ending philosophical dispute.  Kant sparked a storm of philosophical work in Germany in the early nineteenth century, beginning with [[German idealism]]. The characteristic theme of idealism was that the world and the mind equally must be understood according to the same categories; it culminated in the work of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], who among many other things said that "The real is rational; the rational is real."

Hegel's work was carried in many directions by his followers and critics. [[Karl Marx]] appropriated both Hegel's [[philosophy of history]] and the empirical ethics dominant in Britain, transforming Hegel's ideas into a strictly materialist form, setting the grounds for the development of a [[social science|science of society]]. [[Søren Kierkegaard]], in contrast, dismissed all [[systematic philosophy]] as an inadequate guide to life and meaning. For Kierkegaard, life is meant to be lived, not a mystery to be solved. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] took idealism to the conclusion that the world was nothing but the futile endless interplay of images and desires, and advocated [[atheism]] and [[pessimism]].  Schopenhauer's ideas were taken up and transformed by [[Nietzsche]], who seized upon their various dismissals of the world to proclaim "[[God is dead]]" and to reject all systematic philosophy and all striving for a fixed truth transcending the individual.  Nietzsche found in this not grounds for pessimism, but the possibility of a new kind of freedom.

19th-century British philosophy came increasingly to be dominated by strands of neo-Hegelian thought, and as a reaction against this, figures such as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[George Edward Moore]] began moving in the direction of [[analytic philosophy]], which was essentially an updating of traditional empiricism to accommodate the new developments in [[logic]] of the German mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]].

===Renaissance philosophy===
[[Renaissance humanism]] emphasized the value of human beings (see [[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]) and opposed [[dogma]] and [[scholasticism]]. This new interest in human activities led to the development of [[political science]] with [[The Prince]] of [[Niccolò Macchiavelli]]. Humanists differed from Medieval scholars also because they saw the natural world as mathematically ordered and pluralistic, instead of thinking of it in terms of purposes and goals. Renaissance philosophy is perhaps best explained by two propositions made by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in his notebooks:
*All of our knowledge has its origins in our perceptions 
*There is no certainty where one can neither apply any of the mathematical sciences nor any of those which are based upon the mathematical sciences.
In a similar way, Galieo based his [[scientific method]] on experiments but also [[mathematical physics|developed mathematical methods for application to problems in physics]]. These two ways to conceive human knowledge formed the background for the principle of [[Empiricism]] and [[Rationalism]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-philosophy/Renaissance-philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationalism===
{{Main|Rationalism}}
Modern philosophy traditionally begins with [[René Descartes]] and his dictum "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]".  In the early seventeenth century the bulk of philosophy was dominated by [[Scholasticism]], written by theologians and drawing upon [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and early Church writings.  Descartes argued that many predominant Scholastic metaphysical doctrines were meaningless or false.  In short, he proposed to begin philosophy from scratch.  In his most important work, ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', he attempts just this, over six brief essays.  He tries to set aside as much as he possibly can of all his beliefs, to determine what if anything he knows for ''certain''.  He finds that he can doubt nearly everything: the reality of physical objects, [[God]], his memories, history, science, even mathematics, but he cannot doubt that he is, in fact, doubting.  He knows what he is thinking about, even if it is not true, and he knows that he is there thinking about it.  From this basis he builds his knowledge back up again.  He finds that some of the ideas he has could not have originated from him alone, but only from God; he proves that God exists.  He then demonstrates that God would not allow him to be systematically deceived about everything; in essence, he vindicates ordinary methods of science and reasoning, as fallible but not false.

===Empiricism===
{{Main|Empiricism}}
Empiricism is a [[theory of knowledge]] which opposes other theories of knowledge, such as rationalism, [[idealism]] and [[historicism]]. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes (only or primarily) via sensory [[experience]] as opposed to rationalism, which asserts that knowledge comes (also) from pure thinking. Both empiricism and rationalism are individualist theories of knowledge, whereas historicism is a [[social epistemology]]. While historicism also acknowledges the role of experience, it differs from empiricism by assuming that sensory data cannot be understood without considering the historical and cultural circumstances in which observations are made. Empiricism should not be mixed up with empirical research because different epistemologies should be considered competing views on how best to do studies, and there is near consensus among researchers that studies should be empirical. Today empiricism should therefore be understood as one among competing ideals of getting knowledge or how to do studies. As such empiricism is first and foremost characterized by the ideal to let observational data "speak for themselves", while the competing views are opposed to this ideal. The term empiricism should thus not just be understood in relation to how this term has been used in the history of philosophy. It should also be constructed in a way which makes it possible to distinguish empiricism among other epistemological positions in contemporary science and scholarship. In other words: Empiricism as a concept has to be constructed along with other concepts, which together make it possible to make important discriminations between different ideals underlying contemporary science.

Empiricism is one of several competing views that predominate in the study of human knowledge, known as epistemology. Empiricism emphasizes the role of [[experience]] and [[evidence]], especially [[sensory perception]], in the formation of ideas, over the notion of innate ideas or [[tradition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2=Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to, for example, rationalism which relies upon reason and can incorporate innate knowledge.

===Political philosophy===
{{Main|Political philosophy}}

Political philosophy is the study of such topics as [[politics]], [[liberty]], [[justice]], [[property]], [[rights]], [[law]], and the enforcement of a [[legal code]] by [[authority]]: what they are, why (or even if) they are needed, what, if anything, makes a [[The purpose of government|government legitimate]], what rights and freedoms it should protect and why, what form it should take and why, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown—if ever. In a [[vernacular]] sense, the term "political philosophy" often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about [[politics]] that does not necessarily belong to the technical discipline of [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hampton |first=Jean  |title=Political philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sHkdq5qhFwC&amp;pg=PR13 |page=xiii |year=1997 |isbn=9780813308586}} [[Charles Blattberg]], who defines politics as "responding to conflict with dialogue," suggests that political philosophies offer philosophical accounts of that dialogue.

===Idealism===
{{Main|Idealism}}

Idealism refers to the group of philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally a construct of the mind or otherwise immaterial. [[Epistemology|Epistemologically]], idealism manifests as a [[skepticism]] about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociology 14th Edition |last=Macionis |first=John J. |year=2012 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-11671-3 |page=88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[ontology|ontological]] doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit.&lt;ref name="Brittanica"&gt;Daniel Sommer Robinson, "Idealism", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/281802/idealism&lt;/ref&gt; Idealism thus rejects [[physicalism|physicalist]] and [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind. An extreme version of this idealism can exist in the philosophical notion of [[solipsism]].

===Existentialism===
{{Main|Existentialism}}

'''Existentialism''' is generally considered to be the philosophical and cultural movement which holds that the starting point of philosophical thinking must be the individual and the experiences of the individual. Building on that, existentialists hold that [[morality|moral thinking]] and [[science|scientific thinking]] together do not suffice to understand human existence, and, therefore, a further set of categories, governed by the norm of [[Authenticity (philosophy)#Existentialism|''authenticity'']], is necessary to understand human existence.&lt;ref&gt;

===Phenomenology===
{{Main|Phenomenology (philosophy)|Existential phenomenology}}
Phenomenology is the study of the structure of experience. It is a broad [[philosophical movement]] founded in the early years of the 20th century by [[Edmund Husserl]], expanded upon by a circle of his followers at the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]] in [[Germany]]. The philosophy then spread to [[France]], the [[United States]], and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's early work.&lt;ref name="Husserlhistory"&gt;{{citation

===Pragmatism===
{{Main|Pragmatism}}
'''Pragmatism''' is a philosophical tradition centered on the linking of practice and theory. It describes a process where theory is extracted from practice, and applied back to practice to form what is called ''intelligent practice''.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Important positions characteristic of pragmatism include [[instrumentalism]], [[radical empiricism]], [[verificationism]], [[conceptualism|conceptual relativity]], and [[fallibilism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
There is general consensus among pragmatists that philosophy should take the methods and insights of modern science into account.&lt;ref name="BiestaBurbules" /&gt;
[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (and his [[pragmatic maxim]]) deserves most of the credit for pragmatism,&lt;ref name="HaackLane2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Susan Haack|author2=Robert Edwin Lane|title=Pragmatism, old &amp; new: selected writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-DWAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=12 February 2011|date=11 April 2006|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-59102-359-3|pages=18–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with later twentieth century contributors [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref name="BiestaBurbules"&gt;Biesta, G.J.J. &amp; Burbules, N.

===Analytic philosophy===
{{Main|Analytic philosophy}}

Analytic philosophy came to dominate [[English-speaking countries]] in the 20th century. In the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], the overwhelming majority of university philosophy departments identify themselves as "analytic" departments.&lt;ref name="Searle03P1"&gt;
"Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the United States are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading philosophers in the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as analytic philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in the analytic tradition—such as phenomenology, classical pragmatism, existentialism, or Marxism—feel it necessary to define their position in relation to analytic philosophy."
[[John Searle]] (2003) ''Contemporary Philosophy in the United States'' in N. Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed., (Blackwell, 2003), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The term generally refers to a broad philosophical tradition&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Avrum Stroll, ''Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy'' (Columbia University Press, 2000), p. 5: "[I]t is difficult to give a precise definition of 'analytic philosophy' since it is not so much a specific doctrine as a loose concatenation of approaches to problems."  Also, see ibid., p. 7: "I think Sluga is right in saying 'it may be hopeless to try to determine the essence of analytic philosophy.'  Nearly every proposed definition has been challenged by some scholar. [...]  [W]e are dealing with a family resemblance concept."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Hans-Johann Glock]], ''What Is Analytic Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 205: "The answer to the title question, then, is that analytic philosophy is a tradition held together ''both'' by ties of mutual influence ''and'' by family resemblances."&lt;/ref&gt; characterized by an emphasis on clarity and argument (often achieved via modern [[formal logic]] and analysis of [[language]]) and a respect for the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref name="LeiterWeb"&gt;[[Brian Leiter]] (2006) webpage [https://web.archive.org/web/20061115002425/http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic.asp ''“Analytic” and “Continental” Philosophy''].
Quote on the definition: "'Analytic' philosophy today names a style of doing philosophy, not a philosophical program or a set of substantive views. Analytic philosophers, crudely speaking, aim for argumentative clarity and precision; draw freely on the tools of logic; and often identify, professionally and intellectually, more closely with the sciences and mathematics, than with the humanities."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Glock, "Was Wittgenstein an Analytic Philosopher?", ''Metaphilosophy'', 35:4 (2004), pp. 419–444.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colin McGinn, ''The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey through Twentieth-Century Philosophy'' (HarperCollins, 2002), p. xi.: "analytical philosophy [is] too narrow a label, since [it] is not generally a matter of taking a word or concept and analyzing it (whatever exactly that might be).  [...]  This tradition emphasizes clarity, rigor, argument, theory, truth. It is not a tradition that aims primarily for inspiration or consolation or ideology. Nor is it particularly concerned with 'philosophy of life,' though parts of it are. This kind of philosophy is more like science than religion, more like mathematics than poetry&amp;nbsp;– though it is neither science nor mathematics."&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Gottlob Frege]]
* [[George Edward Moore]]
* [[Bertrand Russell]]
* [[Moritz Schlick]]
* [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]

      <comment>“Utilitarianism” is a more appropriate term than “consequentialism” given the following description.</comment>

'''Moral particularism''' is the view that there are no [[moral principle]]s and that moral judgement can be found only as one decides particular cases, either real or imagined. This stands in stark contrast to other prominent moral theories, such as [[deontology]] or [[utilitarianism]]. In the former, it is asserted that people have a set of duties (that are to be considered or respected); in the latter, people are to respect the happiness or the preferences of others in their actions. Particularism, to the contrary, asserts that there are no overriding principles that are applicable in every case, or that can be abstracted to apply to every case.

According to particularism, most notably defended by [[Jonathan Dancy]], moral knowledge should be understood as knowledge of moral [[rule of thumb|rules of thumb]], which are not principles, and of particular solutions, which can be used by [[analogy]] in new cases. It ultimately requires that one will be in good faith upon each particular circumstance as opposed to falling under the influence of narcissism. 

The term "particularism" was coined to designate this position by [[R. M. Hare]], in 1963 (''Freedom and Reason'', Oxford: Clarendon, p.&amp;nbsp;18).

A largely coincident view about law was defended by [[António Castanheira Neves|Castanheira Neves]] in his 1967 major work.

To summarize that view, as Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], of the United States Supreme Court, said in reference to [[bright-line rules]], "no single set of legal rules can capture the ever changing complexity of human life."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5767">'''Otto Friedrich Bollnow''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbɔlnoː|lang}}; 14 March 1903 – 7 February 1991) was a German philosopher and teacher.

==Biography==
He was born the son of a rector in [[Stettin]] in what was then northwest Germany (now Szczecin, [[Poland]]) and went to school in the town of [[Anklam]]. After gaining his Abitur (school leaving certificate) he studied mathematics and physics at [[Göttingen]] University, where he was influenced by the philosopher [[Herman Nohl]]. Bollnow received a doctorate in physics in 1925 and successfully completed his [[habilitation]] with [[Georg Misch]] at Göttingen in 1931. He taught at Göttingen for some years without being appointed to the faculty. Bollnow was a member of the [[Militant League for German Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kant.uni-mainz.de/ks/history/leaman.html Die Kant-Studien im Dritten Reich], George Leaman, Bowling Green / Gerd Simon, Tübingen&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 Bollnow signed the ''[[w:de:Bekenntnis der deutschen Professoren zu Adolf Hitler|Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State]]''.

In 1939 he moved to the [[University of Gießen]] then briefly to the [[University of Kiel]], to the [[University of Mainz]] and finally in 1953 to a chair in contemporary philosophy, philosophical anthropology and ethics at the [[University of Tübingen]]. He taught at Tübingen until his retirement in 1970.

Bollnow concerned himself with the foundations of philosophy and with [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[Existentialism|existential philosophy]]. He developed the work of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] on [[hermeneutics]] and was concerned with the philosophical foundations of [[pedagogy]].

In 1980 he received the [[Lessing-Prize]], a literary and cultural honour endowed by German Freemasons.

He died in [[Tübingen]].

{{Split|Property (philosophy)|Property (mathematics)|date=June 2018}}
In [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[philosophy]], a '''property''' is a characteristic of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]]; a red object is said to have the property of redness. The property may be considered a form of object in its own right, able to possess other properties. A property, however, differs from individual objects in that it may be [[instantiation principle|instantiated]], and often in more than one thing. It differs from the logical/mathematical concept of [[class (set theory)|class]] by not having any concept of [[extensionality]], and from the philosophical concept of [[class (philosophy)|class]] in that a property is considered to be distinct from the objects which possess it. Understanding how different individual entities (or particulars) can in some sense have some of the same properties is the basis of the [[problem of universals]]. The terms '''attribute''' and [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] have similar meanings.

==Metaphysical Debates about the Nature of Properties==
In modern [[analytic philosophy]] there are several debates about the fundamental nature of properties. These center around questions such as: Are properties real? Are they categorical or dispositional? Are properties physical or mental?
===Realism vs. Anti-Realism&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/#DisTer&lt;/ref&gt;=== 
A realist about properties asserts that properties have genuine existence. One way to spell this out is in terms of exact, repeatable, instantiations known [[universals]]. The other realist position asserts that properties are particulars(tropes), which are unique instantiations in individual objects that merely resemble one another to various degrees.

The anti-realist position, often referred to as [[nominalism]] claims that properties are names we attach to particulars. The properties themselves have no existence.

===Categoricalism vs. Dispositionalism&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/#CatProVsCauPow&lt;/ref&gt;=== 
According to the categoricalist, dispositions reduce to causal bases. The fragility of a wine glass, for example, is not a property that exists in the glass. Rather it can be explained by the categorical property of the glass's micro-structural composition.

Dispositionalism, in turn, asserts that a property is nothing more that a set of causal powers.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dispositions/#CatDisLawNat&lt;/ref&gt; Fragility, according to this view, identifies a real property of the glass (e.g. to shatter when dropped on a sufficiently hard surface).

Several intermediary positions exist.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dispositions/#CatDisLawNat&lt;/ref&gt; The Identity view that states that properties are both categorical(qualitative) and dispositional, they are just two ways of viewing the same property. One hybrid view claims that some properties are categorical and some are dispositional. A second hybrid view claims that properties have both a categorical(qualitative) and dispositional part, but that these are distinct ontological parts.

===Physicalism, Idealism, and Property dualism===
{{Main|Physicalism}}
{{Main|Idealism}}
{{Main|Property dualism}}
[[Image:Property dualism.jpg|thumb|Property dualism: the exemplification of two kinds of property by one kind of substance]] Property dualism describes a category of positions in the [[philosophy of mind]] which hold that, although the world is constituted of just one kind of [[substance theory|substance]]—the physical kind—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: [[physical properties]] and [[mental properties]]. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in some physical substances (namely brains).

This stands in contrast to physicalism and idealism. Physicalism claims that all properties, include mental properties, ultimately reduce to, or supervene on, physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysical Idealism, by contrast, claims that "something mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate foundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality."&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/idealism/#Int&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essential and accidental properties==
In classical [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] terminology, a ''property'' (Greek: ''idion'', Latin: ''proprium'') is one of the [[predicables]]. It is a non-[[essence|essential]] quality of a species (like an [[accident (philosophy)|accident]]), but a quality which is nevertheless characteristically present in members of that species. For example, "ability to laugh" may be considered a special characteristic of human beings. However, "laughter" is not an ''essential'' quality of the species ''human'', whose Aristotelian definition of "rational animal" does not require laughter. Therefore, in the classical framework, ''properties'' are characteristic qualities that are not truly required for the continued existence of an entity but are, nevertheless, possessed by the entity.

==Determinate and determinable properties==
A property may be classified as either determinate or determinable. A determinable property is one that can get more specific. For example, color is a determinable property because it can be restricted to redness, blueness, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinate-determinables/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy ''Determinate and Determinable Properties'']&lt;/ref&gt; A determinate property is one that cannot become more specific. This distinction may be useful in dealing with issues of [[identity (philosophy)|identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| accessdate = 2008-01-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lovely and suspect qualities==
[[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes between ''lovely'' properties (such as loveliness itself), which, although they
require an observer to be recognised, exist latently in perceivable objects; and ''suspect'' properties which have no existence at all until attributed by an observer (such as being suspected of a crime)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/lovely&amp;s.htm|title=Lovely and Suspect Qualities|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and predicates==
The ontological fact that something has a property is typically represented in language by applying a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] to a [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. However, taking any grammatical predicate whatsoever to be a property, or to have a corresponding property, leads to certain difficulties, such as [[Russell's paradox]] and the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]]. Moreover, a real property can imply a host of true predicates: for instance, if X has the property of weighing more than 2 kilos, then the predicates "..weighs more than 1.9 kilos", "..weighs more than 1.8 kilos", etc., are all true of it. Other predicates, such as "is an individual", or "has some properties" are uninformative or vacuous. There is some resistance to regarding such so-called '''"[[Cambridge_change|Cambridge properties]]"''' as legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/existence/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Michael|last=Nelson|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2012|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2016|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intrinsic and extrinsic properties==
{{main|Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)}}
An '''intrinsic''' property is a property that an object or a thing has of itself, independently of other things, including its context.  An '''extrinsic''' (or '''relational''') property is a property that depends on a thing's relationship with other things. The latter is sometimes also called an '''attribute''', since the value of that property is ''given'' to the object via its relation with another object. (See the [[etymology]] of the word on [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attribute Wiktionary].) For example, [[mass]] is a physical intrinsic property of any [[Physical body|physical object]], whereas [[weight]] is an extrinsic property that varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field in which the [[respect]]ive object is placed. other examples are the ''name'' of a person (an attribute given by the person's parents) and the weight or mass of the person.

==Relations==
A relation is often considered{{by whom|date=March 2011}} to be a more general case of a property. Relations are true of several particulars, or shared amongst them. Thus the relation ".. is taller than .." holds "between" two individuals, who would occupy the two ellipses ('..'). Relations can be expressed by N-place predicates, where N is greater than 1.

It is widely accepted{{by whom|date=March 2011}} that there are at least some apparent relational properties which are merely derived from non-relational (or 1-place) properties. For instance "A is heavier than B" is a relational ''predicate'', but it is derived from the two non relational properties: the mass of A and the mass of B. Such relations are called external relations, as opposed to the more genuine internal relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hume.ucdavis.edu/mattey/phi156/moore.pdf [[G. E. Moore|George Moore]], ''External and Internal Relations'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers believe that all relations are external, leading to a scepticism about relations in general, on the basis that external relations have no fundamental existence.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7551">The Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB) is a general health [[quality of life]] [[questionnaire]] which measures overall status and [[well-being]] over the previous three days in four areas: physical activities, social activities, mobility, and symptom/problem complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rehab Measures: Quality of Well Being and Self-Administered version|url=http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=1037|work=RehabMeasures.org|publisher=Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of 71 items and takes 20 minutes to complete.&lt;ref name= "guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=McDowell|first=Ian|title=MEASURING HEALTH: A Guide to Rating Scales and Questionnaires|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195165675|pages=675–683|url=http://a4ebm.org/sites/default/files/Measuring%20Health.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two different versions of the QWB; the original was designed to be administered by an interviewer, and the second development (the QWB-SA) was designed to be self-administered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality of Well Being|url=http://www.scireproject.com/outcome-measures/quality-of-well-being|work=SCIREproject.com|publisher=Monkey Hill Health Communications|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four domain scores of the questionnaire are combined into a total score that ranges from 0 to 1.0, with 1.0 representing optimum function and 0 representing death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health-Related Quality of Life Measures|url=http://www.healthmeasurement.org/Measures.html|work=HealthMeasurement.org|publisher=The Health Measurement Research Group|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The QWB was originally called the Health Status Index, then the Index of Well-Being, and then eventually became the Quality of Well-Being Scale.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt; It has undergone several modifications since its development.

The process of administering the QWB can be described in three stages. They are the assessment of functional status, scaling the responses and indicating [[prognosis]].

Assessment of functional status involves a structured interview which records the symptoms and problems experienced over the last eight days. It is used to classify the patient’s level of functioning. The interview takes about seven minutes or longer, according to the patient’s level of health. Questions in the interview covered three criteria of functioning: physical activity, social activity and mobility and confinement. The interview also records the presence of symptoms or problem complexes, which are problems that were experienced on the previous day, but were not being experienced at the present time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Busija|first=L|author2=Pausenberger, E |author3=Haines, TP |author4=Haymes, S |author5=Buchbinder, R |author6= Osborne, RH |title=Adult measures of general health and health-related quality of life: Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-Item (SF-36) and Short Form 12-Item (SF-12) Health Surveys, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 6D (SF-6D), Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB), and Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL).|journal=Arthritis Care &amp; Research|date=Nov 2011|volume=63|issue=Suppl 11|pages=S383-412|doi=10.1002/acr.20541|pmid=22588759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The responses from the interview were then scaled. Preference weights were given for each function level by 867 raters. The preference weights indicated the social judgement of the importance of each function level. A score is generated, which is known as W. W can then be adjusted to reflect the [[prognosis]] of a given medical condition.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt;

== International use ==
Since the development of the Quality of Well-Being Scale and the consequent Quality of Well-Being Scale-Self Administered, the questionnaire has been utilized in numerous studies worldwide. Due to the general nature of the questionnaire, it has proven useful in a variety of different formats and contexts.

One way in which the QWB and the QWB-SA has been utilized is that it has been a comparator used to validate other measures, or a starting point for creating subscales of the questionnaire. An example of this is a subscale developed for use with the QWB-SA that assesses [[mental health]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarkin|first=AJ|author2=Groessl, EJ |author3=Carlson, JA |author4=Tally, SR |author5=Kaplan, RM |author6=Sieber, WJ |author7= Ganiats, TG |title=Development and validation of a mental health subscale from the Quality of Well-Being Self-Administered.|journal=Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation|date=Sep 2013|volume=22|issue=7|pages=1685–96|doi=10.1007/s11136-012-0296-2|pmid=23104088|pmc=4819419}}&lt;/ref&gt; a comparator study seeking to investigate the Health and Activity Limitation Index&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boslaugh|first=SE|author2=Andresen, EM |author3=Recktenwald, A |author4= Gillespie, K |title=Evidence for potential bias in the Health and Activity Limitation Index as a health preference measure for persons with disabilities.|journal=Disability and health journal|date=Jan 2009|volume=2|issue=1|pages=20–6|doi=10.1016/j.dhjo.2008.07.004|pmid=21122739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a study seeking to validate a new questionnaire called the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-8D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=J|author2=Iezzi, A |author3=Khan, MA |author4= Maxwell, A |title=Validity and Reliability of the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-8D Multi-Attribute Utility Instrument.|journal=The patient|date=Nov 23, 2013|pmid=24271592 |doi=10.1007/s40271-013-0036-x |pmc=3929769 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=85–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reclaiming''' is a [[Witchcraft (contemporary)|modern witchcraft]] tradition, aiming to combine the [[Goddess movement]] with feminism and [[political activism]] (in the [[Peace movement|peace]] and [[anti-nuclear movement]]s). Reclaiming was founded in 1979, in the context of the ''Reclaiming Collective'' (1978–1997), by two [[Modern paganism|Neopagan]] women of [[Jews|Jewish]] descent, [[Starhawk]] and Diane Baker, in order to explore and develop feminist Neopagan emancipatory rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Salomonsen (2002:1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the organization focuses on progressive social, political, environmental and economic activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==History==
Reclaiming originated in 1979 in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], blending the influences of [[Victor Anderson (poet)|Victor]] and Cora Anderson's [[Feri Tradition]] of Witchcraft, [[Dianic Wicca|Dianic Witchcraft]] as taught by [[Zsuzsanna Budapest|Z. Budapest]], and the [[feminism|feminist]], [[anarchist]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reclaimingquarterly.org/ ''Reclaiming Quarterly'', the organization's main publication.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[peace movement|peace]], and [[environmental movement|environmental]] movements.

Researcher Rachel Morgain writes:
{{quote|Founding members of Reclaiming drew from earth-based pagan and magical traditions and from a growing feminist spirituality literature signalled by the publication of works such as Mary Daly's (1978) ''Gyn/Ecology'' and Christ and Plastow's (1979) ''Woman-Spirit Rising'', melding this with the anarchist politics and methods of participatory democracy of the direct-action movement to form a unique tradition of Paganism bent on radical social transformation, despite a broadening membership base that has diluted some of its more revolutionary foundations. The focus on social change remains central among many core practitioners, while the activism, books and writings of Reclaiming's most famous priestess, Starhawk, continue to draw in layers of new members from earth-activist and other radical political communities. Central to this Reclaiming focus on social transformation is their theology of 'immanence' which teachers see as very different from the emphasis on 'transcendence' in major world religions, particularly the Judaeo-Christian tradition. For reclaiming teachers, immanent theology places sacrality primarily in the material world, particularly in the natural world and in human beings.&lt;ref name="uncanny"&gt; Rachel Morgain. (October 2012) "On the Use of the Uncanny in Ritual". ''Religion'', 42:4, 521–548. &lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Influences and teachings==
Reclaiming's spiritual approach is based in the feminist [[Goddess movement]] and [[matriarchal religion]]. On some levels Reclaiming has much in common with [[Wicca]], and the Wiccan [[Charge of the Goddess]] is commonly utilised; part of it is quoted in Reclaiming's core agenda, known as "The Principles of Unity". However, given its focus on dismantling and resisting structures of power and domination, Reclaiming uses [[consensus process]] and non-hierarchical structure in its covens – there is no [[High priest|High Priest]] or High Priestess as there would be in an [[Alexandrian Wicca|Alexandrian]] or [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]] witchcraft [[coven]]. Reclaiming members are encouraged to take an active part in co-creating group rituals. 

Theologically, Reclaiming is very diverse and inclusive. The common thread is an active honoring and defending of the Earth, and a support of the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. Teaching and rituals, which are often focused on [[shamanic]] techniques such as [[guided meditation]], [[trance]] work, shapeshifting and [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] dance (as in the [[Spiral dance]], an iconic group dance often performed at rituals and at protest rallies), is empowering the individual and the community to take action. Reclaiming often uses chant as part of its rituals and has released numerous recordings of chants used in the movement. The embodiment of [[myth]] and [[fairytale]] in dramatic rituals (often done with spontaneity, a quality highly valued in the movement) which enact the cycle of the Seasons or the lessons of particular gods and goddesses are important in Reclaiming.

Reclaiming rituals are designed to encourage a spiritual way of life that blends respect for the earth and other livings beings with a fuller sense of personal well-being and alignment with spiritual values. Starhawk and Valentine's handbook ''Twelve Wild Swans'' involves instructions for interpreting the tale of the book's title through both the 'inner' and 'outer' paths of personal and social transformation, the two paths being seen alike as necessary facets of the same overall project. Without a focus on healing the self, Reclaiming members believe people are certain to perpetuate the social ills they have internalised through the damage done by modernity. Their ritual work is thus focused as much on personal healing and transformation as on social justice.&lt;ref name="uncanny"/&gt;

Among the tradition's teachers are Starhawk, author of ''[[Spiral Dance (book)|The Spiral Dance]]'' and several other books; [[T. Thorn Coyle]], author of ''Evolutionary Witchcraft''; Diane Baker and Anne Hill, co-authors of ''Circle Round: Raising Children in the Goddess Tradition (1998)'' and [[M. Macha Nightmare]], co-author of ''The Pagan Book of Living and Dying''.

==Activities==
Today, Reclaiming has several dozen affiliated communities across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia. Weeklong intensives called "Witchcamps" bring Reclaiming people together in about a dozen regions. Classes such as "Elements of Magic", "Rites of Passage", and specific meditative and magical techniques such as the "Pearl Pentacle" and the "Iron Pentacle" assist participants to share practical skills in personal empowerment and group process. Reclaiming has also produced several CDs of Pagan chants and songs, and publishes the magazine ''Reclaiming Quarterly''.

[[File:Karte des Deutschen Reiches, Weimarer Republik-Drittes Reich 1919–1937.svg|thumb|right|320px|The German Reich within its 1937 borders]]
'''''{{lang|de|Reichsbürgerbewegung}}''''' ("Reich Citizens' Movement") or '''''Reichsbürger''''' ("Reich Citizens") is a label for several groups and individuals in Germany and elsewhere who reject the legitimacy of the modern German state, the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/.premium.MAGAZINE-guns-anti-semitisms-and-fake-kings-germany-s-dangerous-new-cult-1.6363088|title=Meet the 'Reichsbürger': Germany's Far-right anti-Semitic Cult That Is Armed to the Teeth|last=Rulf|first=Kirsten|date=2018-08-09|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They maintain that the [[German Reich]] (or, occasionally, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]])&lt;ref name="taz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taz.de/1/politik/deutschland/artikel/1/gefaehrliche-irre |title='Kommissarische Reichsregierungen': Gefährliche Irre |last=Oppong |first=Martin |date=15 May 2008 |work=[[Die Tageszeitung]] |language=German |accessdate=2009-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; continues to exist in its [[Territorial evolution of Germany|pre-World War II borders]], and that it is governed by a '''''{{lang|de|Kommissarische Reichsregierung}}''''' (''{{lang|de|KRR}}'', Provisional Reich Government), or ''{{lang|de|Exilregierung}}'' ("[[government in exile]]").&lt;ref name="Tagi"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/panorama/vermischtes/Reichsfuehrerschein-im-Thurgau-nicht-gueltig/story/27903000 |title='Reichsführerschein' im Thurgau nicht gültig |last=Thiriet |first=Maurice |date=11 March 2009|work=[[Tages-Anzeiger]] |language=German |accessdate=2009-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of competing {{lang|de|KRR}}s, each claiming to govern all of Germany.

==Arguments==
{{See also|Legal status of Germany}}
The self-described ''{{lang|de|Reichsbürger}}'' ("Reich citizens") maintain that the Federal Republic of Germany is illegitimate and that the Reich's 1919 [[Weimar Constitution]] remains in effect. Most of their arguments are based on a selective reading of a 1973 decision of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] concerning the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] between [[West Germany|West]] and [[East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|BVerfGE}} 36, 1 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The judgement held that the 1949 [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] (''{{lang|de|Grundgesetz}}'') itself assumes that the Reich, as a subject of international law, despite the [[German Instrument of Surrender]] and the [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation]], had survived the collapse of [[Nazi Germany]], but is incapable of acting as a state because it lacks any organization, such as governmental authorities.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|de|Das Grundgesetz – nicht nur eine These der Völkerrechtslehre und der Staatsrechtslehre! – geht davon aus, dass das Deutsche Reich den Zusammenbruch 1945 überdauert hat und weder mit der Kapitulation noch durch Ausübung fremder Staatsgewalt in Deutschland durch die alliierten Okkupationsmächte noch später untergegangen ist ... Das entspricht auch der ständigen Rechtsprechung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, an der der Senat festhält. Das Deutsche Reich existiert fort ..., besitzt nach wie vor Rechtsfähigkeit, ist allerdings als Gesamtstaat mangels Organisation, insbesondere mangels institutionalisierter Organe selbst nicht handlungsfähig. ... Mit der Errichtung der Bundesrepublik Deutschland wurde nicht ein neuer westdeutscher Staat gegründet, sondern ein Teil Deutschlands neu organisiert.}}" (citations omitted)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''{{lang|de|Reichsbürger}}'' do not, however, cite the Court's further holding that the Federal Republic is not a [[succession of states|successor state]] to the Reich, but, as a West German state at that time partially, and today—since 1990—fully identical to it.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|de|Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland ist also nicht ‚Rechtsnachfolger‘ des Deutschen Reiches, sondern als Staat identisch mit dem Staat ‚Deutsches Reich‘, – in Bezug auf seine räumliche Ausdehnung allerdings ‚teilidentisch‘, so dass insoweit die Identität keine Ausschließlichkeit beansprucht.}}"&lt;/ref&gt; Instead they claim to have restored the governmental bodies of the German Reich and to be capable of acting on the basis of the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar Constitution|Constitution]].

==History==
The original ''{{lang|de|Kommissarische Reichsregierung}}'' was founded in 1985 by [[Wolfgang Gerhard Guenter Ebel]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.der-reichskanzler.de/&lt;/ref&gt; a former {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany)|Reichsbahn]]}} traffic superintendent in [[West Berlin]]. Ebel, who appointed himself [[Chancellor of Germany|Reich Chancellor]], claimed to be acting on the authority of the Allied occupation authorities. Some of the members of his "cabinet" later fell out with Ebel, and established provisional governments of their own with names such as ''{{lang|de|Exilregierung Deutsches Reich}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Deutsches Reich [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]}}'' (the latter being based in [[Nevada]], USA).

{{lang|de|KRR}}s engage in activities such as issuing currency and stamps, as well as promoting themselves through the Internet and other media. Where the number of their adherents allows, they also emulate the "re-established" institutions, such as courts or parliaments, of the [[Weimar Republic]] or of earlier [[States of Germany|German states]]. A restored ''{{lang|de|[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]}}'' temporarily existed as well as several Reich Ministers, state governments, and a ''{{lang|de|[[Reichsgericht]]}}''.

==Membership==
{{As of|2018|04|28|alt=In April 2018}}, German authorities said that membership had grown by 80% over the past two years, more than estimated earlier. Germany's domestic intelligence service, the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] (BfV), estimated that there were about 18,000 people who supported the far-right Reichsbürger movement, the largest number of supporters, about 3,500 Reichsbürger members, being in Bavaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-far-right-reichsb%C3%BCrger-movement-larger-than-earlier-estimated/a-43580603 |title=Germany's far-right Reichsbürger movement larger than earlier estimated |date=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was also reported that they were trying to build an army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/report-far-right-reichsbürger-movement-is-growing-building-army/a-42123450 |title=Report: Far-right Reichsbürger movement is growing, building army|date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
As of 2009, there was no reliable count of the number of KRRs then existing, but the ''KRR FAQ'', an online registry maintained by a German jurist, lists some 60 persons or organizations associated with operating competing KRRs. Several (though by no means all) KRRs have links to [[far-right politics in Germany|far-right]] extremist or [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups,&lt;ref name="taz"/&gt; and are under observation by the German [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]].

Some KRRs are ready to issue, for a fee, "official" documents such as building permits, and driving licences, which their adherents or gullible citizens may attempt to use in everyday life.&lt;ref name="Tagi"/&gt; In one instance, Wolfgang Ebel's KRR issued an "excavation permit" to the [[Principality of Sealand]] (a [[micronation]]), who then had men dig up a plot of land in the [[Harz]] region in search of the [[Amber Room]] for two weeks, until the landowner hired a private security service to drive them off.&lt;ref name="TAZ Gessler"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2000/08/15/a0194 |title=Die Reichsminister drohen mit dem Tod |author=Philip Gessler |date=2000-08-15 |work=[[Die Tageszeitung]] |language=German |accessdate=2009-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 2002 Ebel's KRR "sold" the {{Interlanguage link multi|Hakeburg|de|Neue Hakeburg}}, a manor in [[Kleinmachnow]] south of the Berlin city limits that had been owned by the German [[Reichspost]] (and therefore, according to Ebel, by his KRR) to one of the two competing governments of Sealand, thus creating, in their view, an enclave of Sealand in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://principality-of-sealand.eu/pdf/docu_hakeburg_all.pdf Document of Sealand's supposed acquisition of the Hakeburg]&lt;/ref&gt;

KRR adherents have also on occasion refused to pay taxes or fines, arguing that the laws providing for such sanctions have no constitutional basis. In the ensuing judicial proceedings, they refuse to recognize the courts as legitimate.&lt;ref name="BZ"/&gt; Some also pursue their activities abroad. In 2009, after Swiss authorities refused to recognize the "Reich Driving Licence" of a German KRR adherent, he unsuccessfully appealed the case up to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Tagi"/&gt;

Wolfgang Ebel's original organization, in particular, continues to attempt enforcing its asserted authority through attempts at intimidation.&lt;ref name="TAZ Gessler"/&gt; According to Ebel, his "government" has issued more than 1,000 "arrest warrants" against people who have disregarded documents issued by the KRR. These warrants inform the addressee that, once the Reich Government is in power, they will be tried for [[high treason]], for which the penalty is death.&lt;ref name="TAZ Gessler"/&gt; Ebel has also admitted owning a "government helicopter" painted in the [[National colours of Germany|national colours]], but has denied using it for intimidating fly-overs.&lt;ref name="TAZ Gessler"/&gt; Several attempts to prosecute Ebel for threats, impersonating a public servant and so forth have failed because, according to German prosecutors, all courts have found him to be [[Insanity defense|legally insane]].&lt;ref name="TAZ Gessler"/&gt;

On 22 May 2017, the ''{{lang|de|[[Bundesverfassungsschutz]]}}'' (Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution; Germany's federal domestic security agency) estimated the number of people affiliated with the movement at 12,600. The agency has been monitoring the group since November 2016, and the security services of individual states have been monitoring the activities of the group for longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/rechtsextremismus-verfassungsschutz-zaehlt-12-600-reichsbuerger-in-deutschland-15028145.html|title=Verfassungsschutz zählt 12.600 Reichsbürger in Deutschland|trans-title=Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution estimates 12.600 Reichsbürger in Germany|date = 22 May 2017|access-date = 23 May 2017|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the heterogeneity of the movement, the division into many small groups that are often independent of one another, poses a difficulty for the states and federal government when estimating the number of active ''Reichsbürger''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/1.4427892|title=„Reichsbürger“-Szene: Schießerei im Staat Ur|last=GmbH|first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|date=2016-09-12|website=FAZ.NET|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interaction with law enforcement authorities===
On August 25, 2016, Adrian Ursache, a self-proclaimed ''Reichsbürger'' and former Mister Germany violently resisted the eviction of his house. The original eviction was scheduled for August 24, 2016, with the official justification for the eviction being the liquidity issues of his household. When the German police arrived on scene they encountered a group of around 120 people, who were staying on Ursache’s and his in-law’s property. To Ursache his property was part of the state of "Ur", proclaimed by him. After the first eviction attempt failed, the German police returned with a special response team the day after. When the eviction started, Ursache began firing at them, lightly injuring two officers. Ursache was shot and rushed to a hospital. The trial for attempted murder began on October 9, 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mdr.de/sachsen-anhalt/halle/chronologie-reichsbuerger-prozess-adrian-ursache-100.html|title=Chronologie: Mordprozess gegen "Reichsbürger" Adrian Ursache {{!}} MDR.DE|last=mdr.de|access-date=2017-11-30|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 19, 2016, in [[Georgensgmünd]] near [[Nuremberg]], a self-described ''Reichsbürger'' fired on a [[Special Deployment Commando|special response unit]] of the [[Bavarian Police]] when they attempted to confiscate his 31 firearms. Three police officers were injured. One of them later died from his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/1.5259630|title=Wolfgang P. aus Georgensgmünd: Lebenslange Haft wegen Polizistenmordes für Reichsbürger|last=GmbH|first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|date=2017-10-23|website=FAZ.NET|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The weapons confiscation followed the revocation of the alleged murderer's firearms permit and his repeated refusal to co-operate with local authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=21 October 2016

German authorities expressed concern at the escalation in violence. The event attracted international attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 October 2016

There were renewed calls for more serious measures against the movement, including revocation of firearms permits and seizure of their weapons, following disciplinary action against police officers with alleged connections to the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|accessdate=7 November 2016 |url=http://www.dw.com/en/a-broken-oath-reichsb%C3%BCrger-in-the-police-force/a-36217758|title= A broken oath: Reichsbürger in the police force |date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|accessdate=7 November 2016 |url=http://www.dw.com/en/state-premier-three-suspected-reichsb%C3%BCrger-police-in-saxony/a-36281953|title= State premier: Three suspected Reichsbürger police in Saxony |date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 27, 2016, a Bavarian police officer was suspended from his duties because of his connections to one of the ''Reichsbürger'' movements.

==List of ''Reichsbürger'' groups==
The numerous small groups and individuals making up the movement are mainly active in the states of [[Brandenburg]], [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]] and [[Bavaria]]. According to German authorities, there are a few hundred adherents in Germany, of which 150 to 200 are in Brandenburg. Most ''Reichsbürger'' are male, over 50 and socially disadvantaged; many adhere to right-wing, anti-semitic and Nazi ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What is behind the right-wing 'Reichsbürger' movement? {{!}} Germany {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 19.10.2016|url=http://www.dw.com/en/what-is-behind-the-right-wing-reichsb%C3%BCrger-movement/a-36094740|accessdate=20 October 2016|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modern science]] is typically divided into three major [[Branches of science|branches]] that consist of the [[natural science]]s (e.g., [[biology]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]]), which study nature in the broadest sense; the [[social science]]s (e.g., [[economics]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]]), which study individuals and societies; and the [[formal science]]s (e.g., [[logic]], [[mathematics]], and [[theoretical computer science]]), which study abstract concepts.

Science is based on [[research]], which is commonly conducted in [[Academic institution|academic]] and [[research institute|research institutions]] as well as in [[Government agency|government agencies]] and [[Company|companies]]. The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of [[science policy|science policies]] that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of [[Product (business)|commercial products]], [[weapon|armaments]], [[health care]], and [[environmental protection]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of science}}
Science in a broad sense existed before the [[modern era]] and in many historical [[civilization]]s.&lt;ref name = Grant1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=Edward|title=History of Science: When Did Modern Science Begin?|journal=The American Scholar|date=1 January 1997|volume=66|issue=1|pages=105–113|jstor=41212592}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modern science]] is distinct in its [[Science#Scientific practice|approach]] and successful in its [[science#Literature|results]], so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term.&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2003 p. vii"&gt;{{harvnb|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"The historian&amp;nbsp;... requires a very broad definition of "science"&amp;nbsp;– one that&amp;nbsp;... will help us to understand the modern scientific enterprise. We need to be broad and inclusive, rather than narrow and exclusive&amp;nbsp;... and we should expect that the farther back we go [in time] the broader we will need to be." &amp;nbsp;— {{harv|Lindberg|2007|p=3}}, which further cites {{cite journal|last1=Pingree|first1=David|author-link=David Pingree|title=Hellenophilia versus the History of Science|journal=Isis|date=December 1992|volume=4|issue=4|pages=554–63|jstor=234257|doi=10.1086/356288|bibcode=1992Isis...83..554P}}}} Science in its original sense was a word for a type of knowledge, rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge. In particular, it was the type of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought. This is shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, [[public works]] at national scale, such as those which harnessed the [[floodplain]] of the [[Yangtse]] with reservoirs,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sima Qian]] (司馬遷, d. 86 BCE) in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (太史公書) covering some 2500 years of Chinese history, records [[Sunshu Ao]] (孫叔敖, fl. c. 630–595 BCE – [[Zhou dynasty]]), the first known [[hydraulic engineer]] of China, cited in ([[Joseph Needham]] et.al (1971) ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' '''4.3''' p. 271) as having built a reservoir which has lasted to this day.&lt;/ref&gt; dams, and dikes, and buildings such as the Pyramids. However, no consistent conscious distinction was made between knowledge of such things, which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems. [[Metallurgy]] was known in prehistory, and the [[Vinča culture]] was the earliest known producer of bronze-like alloys. It is thought that early experimentation with heating and mixing of substances over time developed into [[alchemy]].

===Classical antiquity===
{{Main|History of science in classical antiquity}}
{{See also|Nature (philosophy)}}
In the classical world, there is no real ancient analog of a modern [[scientist]]. Instead, well-educated, usually upper-class, and almost universally male individuals performed various investigations into nature whenever they could afford the time.&lt;ref name="Lehoux"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lehoux|first1=Daryn|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature : From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226317830|page=39|chapter=2. Natural Knowledge in the Classical World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the invention or discovery of the [[concept]] of "[[nature]]" ([[ancient Greek]] ''[[phusis]]'') by the [[Pre-Socratic philosopher]]s, the same words tend to be used to describe the ''natural'' "way" in which a plant grows,&lt;ref&gt;See the quotation in [[Homer]] (8th&amp;nbsp;century BCE) [[Nature#cite note-2|''Odyssey'' 10.302–03]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the "way" in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god. For this reason, it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense, and also the first people to clearly distinguish "nature" and "convention."&lt;ref&gt;"Progress or Return" in ''An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss'' (Expanded version of ''Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss'', 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209}} [[Natural philosophy]], the precursor of [[natural science]], was thereby distinguished as the knowledge of nature and things which are true for every community, and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was ''philosophy''&amp;nbsp;– the realm of the first philosopher-physicists.

A turning point in the history of early philosophical science was [[Socrates]]' example of applying philosophy to the study of human matters, including human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. The [[Socratic method]] as documented by [[Plato]]'s dialogues is a [[dialectic]] method of hypothesis elimination: better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. This was a reaction to the [[Sophist]] emphasis on [[rhetoric]]. The Socratic method searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DApol.%3Apage%3D17 |title=Plato, Apology| page= 17 |accessdate=2017-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129145253/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DApol.%3Apage%3D17 |archivedate=January 29, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self-criticism.

[[Aristotle]] later created a systematic programme of [[teleological]] philosophy: Motion and change is described as the actualization of potentials already in things, according to what types of things they are. In his physics, the Sun goes around the Earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a [[formal cause]], a [[final cause]], and a role in a cosmic order with an [[unmoved mover]]. The Socratics also insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]]). Aristotle maintained that man knows a thing scientifically "when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way, and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aristotle|title=Nicomachean Ethics|edition=H.

Because of the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] due to the [[Migration Period]] an intellectual decline took place in the western part of Europe in the 400s. In contrast, the [[Byzantine Empire]] resisted the attacks from the barbarians, and preserved and improved upon the learning. [[John Philoponus]], a Byzantine scholar in the 500s, was the first scholar ever to question Aristotle's teaching of physics and to note its flaws. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration to medieval scholars as well as to Galileo Galilei who ten centuries later, during the [[Scientific Revolution]], extensively cited Philoponus in his works while making the case as to why Aristotelian physics was flawed.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David.

During [[late antiquity]] and the [[early Middle Ages]], the Aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomena was used. Aristotle's [[four causes]] prescribed that four "why" questions should be answered in order to explain things scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' II, 3, and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' V, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Western Roman Empire and periodic political struggles. However, the general fields of science (or "[[natural philosophy]]" as it was called) and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved through the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like [[Isidore of Seville]].&lt;ref name=Grant1996&gt;{{cite book | title=The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional and Intellectual Contexts | series=Cambridge Studies in the History of Science | first1=Edward | last1=Grant | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1996 | isbn=0521567629 | pages=7–17 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YyvmEyX6rZgC }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle's original texts were eventually lost in Western Europe, and only one text by Plato was widely known, the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', which was the only Platonic dialogue, and one of the few original works of classical natural philosophy, available to Latin readers in the early Middle Ages.

By the eleventh century most of Europe had become Christian; stronger monarchies emerged; borders were restored; technological developments and agricultural innovations were made which increased the food supply and population.

By 1088, the first university in Europe (the [[University of Bologna]]) had emerged from its clerical beginnings. Demand for Latin translations grew (for example, from the [[Toledo School of Translators]]); western Europeans began collecting texts written not only in Latin, but also Latin translations from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew.

An ''experiment'' in this period would be understood as a careful process of observing, describing, and classifying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Albertus-Magnus |title=St. Albertus Magnus &amp;#124; German theologian, scientist, and philosopher |accessdate=2017-10-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028045424/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Albertus-Magnus |archivedate=October 28, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent scientist in this era was [[Roger Bacon]]. Scholasticism had a strong focus on revelation and [[dialectic|dialectic reasoning]], and gradually fell out of favour over the next centuries, as [[alchemy]]'s focus on experiments that include direct observation and meticulous documentation slowly increased in importance.

=== Renaissance and early modern science ===
{{Main|Scientific Revolution}}
[[File:Tycho instrument sextant mounting 19.jpg|thumb|right|[[Astronomy]] became more [[accurate]] after [[Tycho Brahe]] devised his [[Measuring instrument|scientific instruments]] for measuring angles between two [[celestial body|celestial bodies]], before the invention of the telescope. [[Tycho's observational astronomy|Brahe's observations]] were the basis for [[Kepler's laws]].]]
Alhazen disproved Ptolemy's theory of vision,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2001}}{{rp|Book I, [6.54]. p. 372}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not make any corresponding changes to Aristotle's metaphysics. The scientific revolution ran concurrently to a process where elements of Aristotle's metaphysics such as ethics, teleology and formal causality slowly fell out of favour. Scholars slowly came to realize that the universe itself might well be devoid of both purpose and ethical imperatives. The development from a physics infused with goals, ethics, and spirit, toward a physics where these elements do not play an integral role, took centuries. This development was enhanced by the [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnations of 1277]], where Aristotle's books were banned by the [[Catholic church]]. This allowed the theoretical possibility of vacuum and motion in a vacuum. A direct result was the emergence of the science of [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]].

New developments in optics played a role in the inception of the [[Renaissance]], both by challenging long-held metaphysical ideas on perception, as well as by contributing to the improvement and development of technology such as the [[camera obscura]] and the [[telescope]]. Before what we now know as the Renaissance started, [[Roger Bacon]], [[Vitello]], and [[John Peckham]] each built up a scholastic ontology upon a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally apperception of the individual and universal [[theory of forms|forms]] of Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3657358|title = Alhacen's Theory of Visual Perception: A Critical Edition, with English Translation and Commentary, of the First Three Books of Alhacen's "De aspectibus", the Medieval Latin Version of Ibn al-Haytham's "Kitāb al-Manāẓir": Volume One|journal = Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|volume = 91|issue = 4|pages = i–337|last1 = Smith|first1 = A.

In the sixteenth century, [[Copernicus]] formulated a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the solar system unlike the [[geocentric model]] of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''.

[[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and others challenged the notion that the only function of the eye is perception, and shifted the main focus in optics from the eye to the propagation of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1086/352843|title = Getting the Big Picture in Perspectivist Optics|journal = Isis|volume = 72|issue = 4|pages = 568–89|year = 1981|last1 = Smith|first1 = A.

Kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at Graz, July 10, 1600. He used Tycho Brahe's method of observation, which was to project the image of the Sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture, instead of looking directly at the Sun. He disagreed with Brahe's conclusion that total eclipses of the Sun were impossible, because there were historical accounts of total eclipses. Instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image&amp;nbsp;– this fact is now fundamental for optical system design). Voelkel, p. 61, notes that Kepler's experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye, because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye.}} Kepler is best known, however, for improving Copernicus' heliocentric model through the discovery of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]. Kepler did not reject Aristotelian metaphysics, and described his work as a search for the [[Musica universalis|Harmony of the Spheres]].

[[Galileo]] made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However, he became persecuted after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems", which greatly offended Urban VIII.&lt;ref name="Pope Urban VIII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html|title=Pope Urban VIII|last=van Helden|first=Al|date=1995|website=The Galileo Project|publisher=|access-date=November 3, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111033150/http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html|archivedate=November 11, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Europe, the new technology of the [[printing press]] was widely used to publish many arguments, including some that disagreed widely with contemporary ideas of nature. [[René Descartes]] and [[Francis Bacon]] published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes emphasized individual thought and argued that mathematics rather than geometry should be used in order to study nature. Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon further questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of "simple" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or "[[formal cause]]", of each complex type of thing. This new science began to see itself as describing "[[Physical law|laws of nature]]". This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as [[mechanistic]]. Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.

=== Age of Enlightenment ===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|[[Isaac Newton]], shown here in a 1689 portrait, made seminal contributions to [[classical mechanics]], [[gravity]], and [[optics]]. Newton shares credit with [[Gottfried Leibniz]] for the development of calculus.]]
As a precursor to the [[Age of Enlightenment]], [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] succeeded in developing a new physics, now referred to as [[classical mechanics]], which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from [[Aristotelian physics]], but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example, "[[energy]]" and "[[potential]]" (modern versions of Aristotelian "[[actuality and potentiality|''energeia'' and ''potentia'']]"). This implied a shift in the view of objects: Where Aristotle had noted that objects have certain innate goals that can be actualized, objects were now regarded as devoid of innate goals. In the style of Francis Bacon, Leibniz assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing. It is during this period that the word "science" gradually became more commonly used to refer to a ''type of pursuit'' of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature&amp;nbsp;– coming close in meaning to the old term "[[natural philosophy]]."

During this time, the declared purpose and value of science became producing wealth and [[invention]]s that would improve human lives, in the [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] sense of having more food, clothing, and other things.  In [[Novum Organum|Bacon's words]], "the real and legitimate goal of sciences is the endowment of human life with new inventions and riches", and he discouraged scientists from pursuing intangible philosophical or spiritual ideas, which he believed contributed little to human happiness beyond "the fume of subtle, sublime, or pleasing speculation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgmbZIybuRoC&amp;pg=PA162|title=The Social and Economic Roots of the Scientific Revolution: Texts by Boris Hessen and Henryk Grossmann|last=Freudenthal|first=Gideon|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Peter|date=2009-05-20|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402096044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and [[Academy|academies]], which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the [[popular culture|popularization]] of science among an increasingly literate population. [[Philosophe]]s introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' and the popularization of [[Newtonianism]] by [[Voltaire]] as well as by Émilie du Châtelet, the French translator of Newton's ''Principia''.

Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the [[history of science]];&lt;ref&gt;see Hall (1954), iii; Mason (1956), 223.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], and [[physics]]; the development of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; a new understanding of [[magnetism]] and [[electricity]]; and the maturation of [[chemistry]] as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.

[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors&amp;nbsp;– Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally&amp;nbsp;– as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of [[nature]] and [[natural law]] to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.&lt;ref&gt;Cassels, Alan. Ideology and International Relations in the Modern World. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th century ===
[[File:Charles Darwin seated crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.80|[[Charles Darwin]] in 1854, by then working towards publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]].'']]
The nineteenth century is a particularly important period in the history of science since during this era many distinguishing characteristics of contemporary modern science began to take shape such as: transformation of the life and physical sciences, frequent use of precision instruments, emergence of terms like "biologist", "physicist", "scientist"; slowly moving away from antiquated labels like "natural philosophy" and "natural history", increased professionalization of those studying nature lead to reduction in amateur naturalists, scientists gained cultural authority over many dimensions of society, economic expansion and industrialization of numerous countries, thriving of popular science writings and emergence of science journals.&lt;ref name="Lightman 19th"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lightman|first1=Bernard|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature : From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226317830|page=367|chapter=13. Science and the Public}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the 19th century, [[John Dalton]] suggested the modern [[atomic theory]], based on [[Democritus]]'s original idea of individible particles called ''atoms''.
[[File:Candle-light-animated.gif|thumb|left|upright=0.80|Combustion and chemical reactions were studied by [[Michael Faraday]] and reported in his lectures before the [[Royal Institution]]: ''[[The Chemical History of a Candle]]'', 1861.]]
Both [[John Herschel]] and [[William Whewell]] systematized methodology: the latter coined the term [[scientist]].&lt;ref name="Whewell scientist"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1962|title=Scientist: The story of a word|url=http://www.informaworld.com/index/739364907.pdf|format=PDF|journal=[[Annals of Science]]|volume=18|issue=2|pages=65–85|doi=10.1080/00033796200202722|ref=harv|author=Ross, Sydney|accessdate=2011-03-08}} To be exact, the person who coined the term ''scientist'' was referred to in Whewell 1834 only as "some ingenious gentleman." Ross added a comment that this "some ingenious gentleman" was Whewell himself, without giving the reason for the identification. Ross 1962, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' he established [[evolution]] as the prevailing explanation of biological complexity. His theory of [[natural selection]] provided a natural explanation of how [[species]] originated, but this only gained wide acceptance a century later.

The laws of [[conservation of energy]], [[conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of mass]] suggested a highly stable universe where there could be little loss of resources. With the advent of the steam engine and the [[industrial revolution]], there was, however, an increased understanding that all forms of energy as defined by Newton were not equally useful; they did not have the same [[energy quality]]. This realization led to the development of the laws of [[thermodynamics]], in which the cumulative energy quality of the universe is seen as constantly declining: the [[entropy]] of the universe increases over time.

The [[electromagnetic theory]] was also established in the 19th century, and raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework. The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the [[atom]] were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of [[X-ray]]s inspired the discovery of [[radioactivity]]. In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the [[electron]].

=== 20th century ===
[[File:ADN animation.gif|thumb|right|The [[DNA]] [[double helix]] is a [[molecule]] that encodes the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living [[organism]]s and many [[virus]]es.]]
[[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] and the development of [[quantum mechanics]] led to the replacement of classical mechanics with a new physics which contains two parts that describe different types of events in nature.

In the first half of the century, the development of [[antibiotics]] and [[artificial fertilizer]] made global human [[population growth]] possible. At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered, leading to the release of "[[atomic energy]]" ([[nuclear power]]). In addition, the extensive use of technological innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to revolutions in transportation ([[automobile]]s and [[aircraft]]), the development of [[ICBM]]s, a [[space race]], and a [[nuclear arms race]].

The molecular structure of [[DNA]] was discovered in 1953. The discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] in 1964 led to a rejection of the [[Steady State theory]] of the universe in favour of the [[Big Bang]] theory of [[Georges Lemaître]].

The development of [[spaceflight]] in the second half of the century allowed the first astronomical measurements done on or near other objects in space, including [[Apollo program|manned landings on the Moon]]. [[Space telescope]]s lead to numerous discoveries in astronomy and cosmology.

Widespread use of [[integrated circuit]]s in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with [[communications satellite]]s led to a revolution in [[information technology]] and the rise of the global [[internet]] and [[mobile computing]], including [[smartphone]]s. The need for mass systematization of long, intertwined causal chains and large amounts of data led to the rise of the fields of [[systems theory]] and computer-assisted [[scientific modelling]], which are partly based on the Aristotelian paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/255139|jstor=255139|title=The History and Status of General Systems Theory|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=15|issue=4|pages=407–26|last1=von Bertalanffy|first1=Ludwig|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harmful [[environmental issue]]s such as [[ozone depletion]], [[Acidification (disambiguation)|acidification]], [[eutrophication]] and [[climate change]] came to the public's attention in the same period, and caused the onset of [[environmental science]] and [[environmental technology]]. In a 1967 article, [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.]] blamed the ecological crisis on the historical decline of the notion of spirit in nature.&lt;ref&gt;White, L., 1967, ''The historical roots of our ecologic crisis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Branches of science}}
&lt;!-- The organizational tables have been moved to the main article "Fields of science" --&gt;
[[History of science#Modern science|Modern science]] is commonly divided into three major [[Branches of science|branches]] that consist of the [[natural sciences]], [[social sciences]], and [[formal sciences]].

There are also closely related disciplines that use science, such as [[engineering]] and [[medicine]].

=== Natural science ===
{{Main|Natural science|Outline of natural science}}

[[Natural science]] is concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]] based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. It can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[Outline of physical science|physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. These two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines. Modern natural science is the successor to the [[natural philosophy]] that began in [[Ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, [[conjecture]]s, and [[presupposition]]s, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh G. Gauch Jr, ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71#v=twopage pp. 71–73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160524/https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic data collection, including [[discovery science]], succeeded [[natural history]], which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.{{sfn|Oglivie|2008|pp=1–2}} Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.&lt;ref name="Wordnet definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|publisher=Princeton University WordNet|accessdate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173506/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|archivedate=March 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social science ===
{{Main|Social science|Outline of social science}}
[[File:Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg|thumb|right|In [[economics]], the [[supply and demand]] model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand.]]
[[Social science]] is concerned with [[society]] and the [[Social relation|relationships]] among [[individuals]] within a society. It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[history]], [[human geography]], [[jurisprudence]], [[linguistics]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[public health]], and [[sociology]]. Social scientists may adopt various [[philosophical theories]] to study individuals and society. For example, [[Positivism|positivist]] social scientists use methods resembling those of the [[natural science]]s as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter [[Modern science|modern sense]]. [[Antipositivism|Interpretivist]] social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically [[falsifiable]] theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often [[Eclecticism|eclectic]], using multiple [[Methodology|methodologies]] (for instance, by combining both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research]]). The term "[[social research]]" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.

=== Formal science ===

[[Formal science]] is involved in the study of [[formal systems]].

The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge. They are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for [[empirical evidence]], to verify their abstract concepts.&lt;ref name="Fetzer2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bill2007"&gt;{{Citation |first=Thompson | last = Bill |title=The Nature of Statistical Evidence |chapter=2.4 Formal Science and Applied Mathematics |publisher=Springer |series=Lecture Notes in Statistics |volume=189 |edition=1st |year=2007 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=10–11}} The formal sciences are therefore [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science.&lt;ref name="Bishop1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge 1998"/&gt; Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences.

== Scientific research ==
{{See also|Research}}
Scientific research can be labeled as either basic or applied research. Basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Although some scientific research is [[applied research]] into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of [[basic research]]. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question "what is the ''use'' of basic research?" he responded: "Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/91|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119113522/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/91|archivedate=January 19, 2012 |title=To Live at All Is Miracle Enough|author= Richard Dawkins |publisher=RichardDawkins.net |date=May 10, 2006 |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's [[rod cell]]s did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our [[night vision]] is not troubled by red light would lead [[search and rescue]] teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007" /&gt;{{rp|106–10}} Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to [[Scientific method#Luck and science|harness luck]].

=== Scientific method ===
{{Main|Scientific method}}
[[File:IRAS 10082-5647.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The central star IRAS 10082-5647 was captured by the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]
Scientific research involves using the [[scientific method]], which seeks to [[objectivity (science)|objectively]] explain the events of [[nature]] in a [[reproducible]] way.{{efn|{{harvnb|di Francia|1976|p=13}}: "The amazing point is that for the first time since the discovery of mathematics, a method has been introduced, the results of which have an intersubjective value!" ''(Author's punctuation)''}} An explanatory [[thought experiment]] or [[hypothesis]] is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as "[[Occam's Razor]]") and are generally expected to seek [[consilience]]&amp;nbsp;– fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena.&lt;ref name=EOWilson&gt;{{cite book| last = Wilson | first = Edward | title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge | publisher = Vintage | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-679-76867-8| ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new explanation is used to make [[falsifiable]] predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.{{efn|{{harvnb|di Francia|1976|pp=4–5}}: "One learns in a laboratory; one learns how to make experiments only by experimenting, and one learns how to work with his hands only by using them. The first and fundamental form of experimentation in physics is to teach young people to work with their hands. Then they should be taken into a laboratory and taught to work with measuring instruments&amp;nbsp;– each student carrying out real experiments in physics. This form of teaching is indispensable and cannot be read in a book."}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Fara|2009|p=204}}: "Whatever their discipline, scientists claimed to share a common scientific method that&amp;nbsp;... distinguished them from non-scientists."}} This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish [[causality|causal relationships]] (to avoid the [[correlation does not imply causation|correlation fallacy]]).

When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded.{{sfn|Nola|Irzik|2005|p=208}} If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a [[scientific theory]], a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a [[Scientific modelling|model]], an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested, based on observable phenomena.{{sfn|Nola|Irzik|2005|pp=199–201}}

While performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=van Gelder | first=Tim | year=1999 | url=http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/tgelder/papers/HeadsIWin.pdf | format=PDF | title="Heads I win, tails you lose": A Foray Into the Psychology of Philosophy | publisher=University of Melbourne | accessdate=March 28, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409054240/http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/tgelder/papers/HeadsIWin.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Pease | first=Craig | date=September 6, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619154617/http://law-and-science.net/Science4BLJ/Scientific_Method/Deliberate.bias/Text.htm | archivedate = June 19, 2010 | title=Chapter 23.

==== Role of mathematics ====
{{Main|Mathematics|Formal science}}
[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|thumb|right|Calculus, the mathematics of continuous change, underpins many of the sciences.]]

[[Mathematics]] is essential in the formation of [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], [[Theory|theories]], and [[physical law|laws]]{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=79–82}} in the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[Social science|social]] sciences. For example, it is used in quantitative [[Scientific modelling|scientific modeling]], which can generate new hypotheses and predictions to be tested. It is also used extensively in observing and collecting [[measurements]]. [[Statistics]], a branch of mathematics, is used to summarize and analyze data, which allow scientists to assess the reliability and variability of their experimental results.

[[Computational science]] applies computing power to [[Simulation#Computer simulation|simulate]] real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]], computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siam.org/students/resources/report.php|title=SIAM: Graduate Education for Computational Science and Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|access-date=November 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228083134/https://www.siam.org/students/resources/report.php|archivedate=December 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Verifiability ====
[[John Ziman]] points out that [[intersubjective verifiability]] is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Ziman cites {{harvnb|Polanyi|1958}} chapter 12, as referenced in {{harvnb|Ziman|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as "perceptual consensibility."&lt;ref name=Ziman1978&gt;{{harvnb|Ziman|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge.&lt;ref name=Ziman1978 /&gt;{{rp|104}}

=== Philosophy of science ===
{{See also|Philosophy of science}}
[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|English philosopher and physician [[John Locke]] (1632–1704), a leading philosopher of British empiricism]]
Scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2003 p. vii" /&gt; Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.

The belief that scientific theories should and do represent [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] reality is known as [[Scientific realism|realism]]. It can be contrasted with [[Anti-realism#Anti-realism in science|anti-realism]], the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as [[electrons]]. One form of anti-realism is [[idealism]], the belief that the mind or [[consciousness]] is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.{{efn|This realization is the topic of [[intersubjective verifiability]], as recounted, for example, by [[Max Born]] (1949, 1965) [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp/naturalphilosoph032159mbp_djvu.txt ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance''], who points out that all knowledge, including natural or social science, is also subjective. p. 162: "Thus it dawned upon me that fundamentally everything is subjective, everything without exception. That was a shock."}} In an idealistic [[world view]], what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.

There are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is [[empiricism]],{{efn|name=Galileo1638|In his investigation of the [[law of falling bodies]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] (1638) serves as example for scientific investigation: ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' "A piece of wooden moulding or scantling, about 12 cubits long, half a cubit wide, and three finger-breadths thick, was taken; on its edge was cut a channel a little more than one finger in breadth; having made this groove very straight, smooth, and polished, and having lined it with parchment, also as smooth and polished as possible, we rolled along it a hard, smooth, and very round bronze ball. Having placed this board in a sloping position, by lifting one end some one or two cubits above the other, we rolled the ball, as I was just saying, along the channel, noting, in a manner presently to be described, the time required to make the descent. We ... now rolled the ball only one-quarter the length of the channel; and having measured the time of its descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former. Next we tried other distances, comparing the time for the whole length with that for the half, or with that for two-thirds, or three-fourths, or indeed for any fraction; in such experiments, repeated many, many, times." Galileo solved the problem of time measurement by weighing a jet of water collected during the descent of the bronze ball, as stated in his ''Two New Sciences''.}} which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.&lt;ref&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;[T]he logical empiricists thought that the great aim of science was to discover and establish ''generalizations''."&amp;nbsp;—{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empiricism generally encompasses [[inductivism]], a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using [[deductive logic]] only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being [[Bayesianism]]{{Sfn|Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=203}} and the [[hypothetico-deductive method]].&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003"&gt;{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|236}}

[[File:Karl Popper2.jpg|left|thumb|The Austrian-British philosopher of science Karl Popper (1902–1994) in 1990. He is best known for his work on [[falsifiability|empirical falsification]].]]
Empiricism has stood in contrast to [[rationalism]], the position originally associated with [[Descartes]], which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003" /&gt;{{rp|20}} [[Critical rationalism]] is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it.&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003" /&gt;{{rp|63–67}} Popper proposed replacing verifiability with [[falsifiability]] as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with [[Falsificationism|falsification]] as the empirical method.&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith,2003" /&gt;{{rp|68}} Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, [[trial and error]].&lt;ref&gt;Popper called this ''Conjecture and Refutation.'' {{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|pp=117–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Objective Knowledge|last=Popper|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach, [[instrumentalism]], colloquially termed "shut up and multiply,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Shut_up_and_multiply|title=Shut up and multiply|last=|first=|date=September 13, 2015|website=LessWrong Wiki|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019082101/https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Shut_up_and_multiply|archivedate=October 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Rationality of Science | author = Newton-Smith, W.H. | location = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 1994 | page = 30|isbn = 978-0-7100-0913-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]). Close to instrumentalism is [[constructive empiricism]], according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.

[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a [[logically consistent]] "portrait" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. He characterized ''normal science'' as the process of observation and "puzzle solving" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas ''revolutionary science'' occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/thomas-kuhn/ |title = Thomas Kuhn |accessdate = 2015-10-26 |last = Bird |first = Alexander |year = 2013 |website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor1-last=Zalta |editor1-first= Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more "portraits" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of [[relativism]].&lt;ref name="KuhnP206"&gt;T.S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 2nd. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1970, p. 206. {{ISBN|0-226-45804-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, another approach often cited in debates of [[scientific skepticism]] against controversial movements like "[[creation science]]" is [[methodological naturalism]]. Its main point is that a difference between natural and [[supernatural]] explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.{{efn|{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=151}} credits [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (1969) "Epistemology Naturalized" ''Ontological Relativity and Other Essays'' New York: Columbia University Press, as well as [[John Dewey]], with the basic ideas of naturalism&amp;nbsp;– [[Naturalized Epistemology]], but Godfrey-Smith diverges from Quine's position: according to Godfrey-Smith, "A naturalist can think that science can contribute to ''answers'' to philosophical questions, without thinking that philosophical questions can be replaced by science questions.".}} That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief [[Non-overlapping magisteria|outside the scope of science]]. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to [[empirical]] study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for [[observation|observable]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = The Review of Metaphysics|title = Casebeer, William D. Natural Ethical Facts: Evolution, Connectionism, and Moral Cognition|author = Brugger, E. Christian|volume = 58| issue = 2|year = 2004|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of these standards, [[Appeal to authority|arguments from authority]], biased [[observational studies]] and other common [[fallacy|fallacies]] are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize.

==== Certainty and science ====
A scientific theory is [[empirical]]{{efn|name=Galileo1638}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structure-scientific-theories/|title=The Structure of Scientific Theories|last=Winther|first=Rasmus Grønfeldt|date=2015|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is always open to [[falsifiability|falsification]] if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly [[Certainty|certain]] as science accepts the concept of [[fallibilism]].{{efn|"No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong."&amp;nbsp;—[[Albert Einstein]], noted by Alice Calaprice (ed. 2005) ''The New Quotable Einstein'' Princeton University Press and Hebrew University of Jerusalem, {{ISBN|0-691-12074-9}} p. 291. Calaprice denotes this not as an exact quotation, but as a paraphrase of a translation of A. Einstein's "Induction and Deduction". ''Collected Papers of Albert Einstein'' '''7''' Document 28. Volume 7 is ''The Berlin Years: Writings, 1918–1921''. A. Einstein; M. Janssen, R. Schulmann, et al., eds.}} The philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] sharply distinguished truth from certainty. He wrote that scientific knowledge "consists in the search for truth," but it "is not the search for certainty&amp;nbsp;... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain."{{sfn|Popper|1996}}{{rp|4}}

New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist [[Keith Stanovich]], it may be the media's overuse of words like "breakthrough" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007" /&gt;{{rp|119–38}} While there are such famous cases as the [[theory of relativity]] that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various [[research]]ers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007" /&gt;{{rp|123}} Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.{{efn|{{cite book|last=Fleck|first=Ludwik|authorlink=Ludwik Fleck|editor1-first=Thaddeus J. |editor1-last=Trenn|editor2-first=Robert K |editor2-last=Merton|title=Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-25325-1}} Claims that before a specific fact "existed", it had to be created as part of a social agreement within a community. [[Steven Shapin]] (1980) "A view of scientific thought" ''Science'' ccvii (Mar 7, 1980) 1065–66 states "[To Fleck,] facts are invented, not discovered. Moreover, the appearance of scientific facts as discovered things is itself a social construction: a ''made'' thing. "}} For example, [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]], [[evolution|the theory of evolution]], [[relativity theory]], and [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] still bear the name "theory" even though, in practice, they are considered [[fact]]ual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=One side can be wrong | first1=Richard | last1=Dawkins | first2=Jerry | last2=Coyne | date=September 2, 2005 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226232200/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research | archivedate=December 26, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Philosopher [[Barry Stroud]] adds that, although the best definition for "[[knowledge]]" is contested, being [[skeptical]] and entertaining the ''possibility'' that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Therefore, scientists adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html |title=Barry Stroud on Scepticism |publisher=philosophy bites |date=December 16, 2007 |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123175047/http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fallibilist]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.&amp;nbsp;S.

Stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a "magic bullet"; it avoids the [[Fallacy of the single cause|single-cause fallacy]]. This means a scientist would not ask merely "What is ''the'' cause of&amp;nbsp;...", but rather "What ''are'' the most significant ''causes'' of&amp;nbsp;...". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. [[psychology]], [[physical cosmology]]).&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Stanovich|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141–47}} [[Research]] often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007" /&gt;{{rp|141–47}} For example, knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.

==== Fringe science, pseudoscience, and junk science ====
An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as [[pseudoscience]], [[fringe science]], or [[junk science]].{{efn|"''Pseudoscientific&amp;nbsp;– pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996)."Defining Pseudoscience", Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169–76, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".
* For example, Hewitt et al. ''Conceptual Physical Science'' Addison Wesley; 3 edition (July 18, 2003) {{ISBN|0-321-05173-4}}, Bennett et al. ''The Cosmic Perspective'' 3e Addison Wesley; 3 edition (July 25, 2003) {{ISBN|0-8053-8738-2}}; ''See also'', e.g., Gauch HG Jr. ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (2003).
* A 2006 [[National Science Foundation]] report on Science and engineering indicators quoted [[Michael Shermer]]'s (1997) definition of pseudoscience: '"claims presented so that they appear [to be] scientific even though they lack supporting evidence and plausibility" (p. 33). In contrast, science is "a set of methods designed to describe and interpret observed and inferred phenomena, past or present, and aimed at building a testable body of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation" (p. 17)'.{{cite book|author=Shermer M.|year=1997|title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time|location=New York|publisher=W.

* "A pretended or spurious science; a collection of related beliefs about the world mistakenly regarded as being based on scientific method or as having the status that scientific truths now have," from the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', second edition 1989.}} Physicist [[Richard Feynman]] coined the term "[[cargo cult science]]" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the "kind of utter honesty" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html |title=Cargo Cult Science |last=Feynman |first=Richard |date=1974 |website=Center for Theoretical Neuroscience |publisher=Columbia University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304032544/http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html |archive-date=March 4, 2005 |dead-url=yes |access-date=November 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories.

There can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as "bad science," research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term "[[scientific misconduct]]" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.&lt;ref name=COPE1999PDF&gt;{{cite journal |title=Coping with fraud |journal=The COPE Report 1999 |pages=11–18 |url=http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/reports/1999/1999pdf3.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928151119/http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/reports/1999/1999pdf3.pdf |quote=It is 10 years, to the month, since Stephen Lock&amp;nbsp;...

=== Scientific literature ===
{{Main|Scientific literature}}
[[File:Science Vol. 1 (1880).jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the first volume of the scientific journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1880.]]
Scientific research is published in an enormous range of [[scientific literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=John Ziman| last=Ziman | first=J.M. | journal=Science | title=The proliferation of scientific literature: a natural process | year=1980 | volume=208 | issue=4442 | pages=369–71 | doi= 10.1126/science.7367863 | pmid=7367863 | ref=harv | bibcode=1980Sci...208..369Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific journal]]s communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, ''[[Journal des Sçavans]]'' followed by the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]]'', began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Krishna | last=Subramanyam |author2=Subramanyam, Bhadriraju | year=1981 | title=Scientific and Technical Information Resources | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=978-0-8247-8297-9 | oclc=232950234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States National Library of Medicine]] currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | title=MEDLINE Fact Sheet | publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] | location=Washington DC | accessdate=October 15, 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016122141/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | archivedate=October 16, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a [[scientific paper]]. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.

[[List of science magazines|Science magazines]] such as ''[[New Scientist]]'', ''[[Science &amp; Vie]]'', and ''[[Scientific American]]'' cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. [[Science book]]s engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the [[science fiction]] genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.

Recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as [[literature]] or more specifically, [[poetry]], include the ''Creative Writing Science'' resource developed through the [[Royal Literary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Mario | last=Petrucci | url=http://writeideas.org.uk/creativescience/index.htm | title=Creative Writing&amp;nbsp;– Science | accessdate=April 27, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106015539/http://writeideas.org.uk/creativescience/index.htm | archivedate=January 6, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, many professional scientists are trained in an [[Academy|academic setting]] and upon completion, attain an [[academic degree]], with the highest degree being a [[doctorate]] such as a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD),&lt;ref name="Cyranoski2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cyranoski | first1 = David | last2 = Gilbert | first2 = Natasha | last3 = Ledford | first3 = Heidi | last4 = Nayar | first4 = Anjali | last5 = Yahia | first5 = Mohammed | year = 2011 | title = Education: The PhD factory | journal = Nature | volume = 472 | issue = 7343 | pages = 276–79 | doi = 10.1038/472276a | pmid = 21512548 | url = https://www.nature.com/news/2011/110420/full/472276a.html| bibcode = 2011Natur.472..276C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD), or [[Doctor of Engineering]] (DEng).

Science has historically been a male-dominated field, with some notable exceptions.{{efn|Women in science have included:
* [[Hypatia]] (c. 350–415 CE), of the [[Library of Alexandria]].
* [[Trotula]] of Salerno, a physician c. 1060 CE.
* [[Caroline Herschel]], one of the first professional astronomers of the 18th and 19th centuries.
* [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]], a doctoral student of [[C.S. Peirce]], who published [[Wittgenstein]]'s proposition 5.101 in her dissertation, 40 years before Wittgenstein's publication of [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]].
* [[Henrietta Leavitt]], a professional human computer and astronomer, who first published the significant relationship between the luminosity of [[Cepheid variable]] stars and their distance from Earth. This allowed Hubble to make the discovery of the [[expanding universe]], which led to the [[Big Bang theory]].
* [[Emmy Noether]], who proved the [[conservation of energy]] and other [[constants of motion]] in 1915.
* [[Marie Curie]], who made discoveries relating to radioactivity along with her husband, and for whom [[Curium]] is named.
* [[Rosalind Franklin]], who worked with X-ray diffraction.
* [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], at first not allowed to study science in her preparatory school, persisted, and was the first to observe and precisely analyse the radio pulsars, for which her supervisor was recognized by the 1974 Nobel prize in Physics. (Later awarded a Special Breakthough prize in Physics in 2018, she donated the cash award in order that women, ethnic minority, and refugee students might become physics researchers.)
* In 2018 [[Donna Strickland]] became the third woman (the second being [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer]] in 1962) to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, for her work in chirped pulse amplification of lasers. [[Frances H. Arnold]] became the fifth woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the directed evolution of enzymes.

Ladd"; Christine "Kitty" Ladd completed the requirements in 1882, but was awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career which spanned the algebra of logic (see [[Truth table#Truth table for all binary logical operators|truth table]]), color vision, and psychology. Her work preceded notable researchers like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

In the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs in physics are given to men.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more deeply and logically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Parents explain more often to boys than to girls during shared scientific thinking|journal=[[Psychol.

Most scientific societies are [[non-profit organization]]s, and many are [[professional association]]s. Their activities typically include holding regular [[academic conference|conferences]] for the presentation and discussion of new research results and publishing or sponsoring [[academic journal]]s in their discipline. Some also act as [[professional bodies]], regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership. Scholars in the [[sociology of science]]{{who|date=September 2014}} argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions.

The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of distinguished [[academy of sciences]] in a number of countries such as the Italian {{lang|it|[[Accademia dei Lincei]]}} in 1603,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://positivamente.lincei.it/ | title=Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei | language=Italian | accessdate=September 11, 2007 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228005402/http://positivamente.lincei.it/ | archivedate=February 28, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the British [[Royal Society]] in 1660, the French {{lang|fr|[[Académie des Sciences]]}} in 1666,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=G.G. | last=Meynell | url=http://www.haven.u-net.com/6text_7B2.htm#Appendix%202 | title=The French Academy of Sciences, 1666–91: A reassessment of the French Académie royale des sciences under Colbert (1666–83) and Louvois (1683–91) | publisher= | accessdate=October 13, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118174108/http://www.haven.u-net.com/6text_7B2.htm#Appendix%202 | archivedate=January 18, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the American  [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1863, the German [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] in 1911, and the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] in 1928. International scientific organizations, such as the [[International Council for Science]], have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations.

=== Science policy ===
{{Main|Science policy|History of science policy|Economics of science}}
[[File:UN-Science-Policy-Business Forum on Environment.jpg|thumb|right|The United Nations ''Global Science-Policy-Business Forum on the Environment'' in Nairobi, Kenya (2017).]]
Science policy is an area of [[public policy]] concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including [[research funding]], often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with [[public policy]] being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.

[[State (polity)|State]] [[policy]] has influenced the funding of [[public works]] and science for thousands of years, particularly within civilizations with highly organized governments such as [[History of China|imperial China]] and the [[Roman Empire]]. Prominent historical examples include the [[Great Wall of China]], completed over the course of two millennia through the state support of [[Dynasties in Chinese history|several dynasties]], and the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] of the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]], an immense feat of [[hydraulic engineering]] begun by [[Sunshu Ao]] (孫叔敖 7th c. BCE), [[Ximen Bao]] (西門豹 5th c.BCE), and Shi Chi (4th c. BCE). This construction dates from the 6th century BCE  under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui Dynasty]] and is still in use today. In China, such state-supported infrastructure and scientific research projects date at least from the time of the [[Mohists]], who inspired the study of [[logic]] during the period of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] and the study of defensive fortifications like the Great Wall of China during the [[Warring States period]].

Public policy can directly affect the funding of [[capital equipment]] and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. [[Vannevar Bush]], director of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] for the United States government, the forerunner of the [[National Science Foundation]], wrote in July 1945 that "Science is a proper concern of government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm|title=Science the Endless Frontier|last=Bush|first=Vannevar|date=July 1945|website=|publisher=National Science Foundation|access-date=November 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107221306/https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm|archivedate=November 7, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Funding of science ====
{{Main|Funding of science}}
[[File:CSIRO Main Entomology Building - Central Block.jpg|thumb|right|The [[CSIRO|Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) Main Entomology Building in Australia]]
Scientific research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most [[developed country|developed countries]] is between 1.5% and 3% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].&lt;ref name="OECD2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |format=PDF |title=Main Science and Technology Indicators&amp;nbsp;– 2008-1 |publisher=[[OECD]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tamBWVvW?url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |archivedate=October 19, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[OECD]], around two-thirds of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by [[universities]] and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in [[social science]] and [[humanities]]. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. [[biotechnology]]) government provides the bulk of the funds for [[Basic science|basic scientific research]]. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include the [[National Science Foundation]] in the [[United States]], the [[CONICET|National Scientific and Technical Research Council]] in Argentina, [[CSIRO|Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) in Australia, {{lang|fr|[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]]}} in France, the [[Max Planck Society]] and {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]}} in Germany, and [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] in Spain. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than "[[Blue skies research|blue-sky]]" ideas or technologies (such as [[nuclear fusion]]).

{{Further|Science outreach|Science communication}}
[[File:Dinosaur exhibit - Houston Museum of Natural Science - DSC01881.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Dinosaur exhibit in the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]]]]
The [[public awareness of science]] relates to the attitudes, behaviors, opinions, and activities that make up the relations between science and the general public. it integrates various themes and activities such as [[science communication]], [[science museum]]s, [[science festival]]s, [[science fair]]s, [[citizen science]], and [[science in popular culture]]. Social scientists have devised various metrics to measure the public understanding of science such as factual knowledge, self-reported knowledge, and structural knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Ladwig"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ladwig|first1=Peter|title=Perceived familiarity or factual knowledge?

===Science journalism===
{{Main|Science journalism}}
The [[mass media]] face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a [[scientific debate]] may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Dickson | first=David | date=October 11, 2004 | url=http://www.scidev.net/en/editorials/science-journalism-must-keep-a-critical-edge.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621053624/http://www.scidev.net/en/editorials/science-journalism-must-keep-a-critical-edge.html | archivedate=June 21, 2010 | title=Science journalism must keep a critical edge | publisher=Science and Development Network

=== Politicization of science ===
{{Main|Politicization of science}}
[[File:Cook et al. (2016) Studies consensus.jpg|thumb|300px|Results of seven papers from 2004–2015 assessing the overwhelming scientific consensus on man-made global warming (see [[Surveys of scientists' views on climate change]]), in contrast to the [[Global warming controversy|political controversy over this issue]], particularly in the [[Public opinion on global warming#United States|United States]].]]
[[Politicization of science]] occurs when [[government]], [[business]], or [[advocacy group]]s use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific research or the way it is disseminated, reported, or interpreted. Many factors can act as facets of the politicization of science such as [[Populism|populist]] [[anti-intellectualism]], perceived threats to religious beliefs, [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] [[subjectivism]], and fear for business interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldberg |first1=Jeanne |title=The Politicization of Scientific Issues: Looking through Galileo's Lens or through the Imaginary Looking Glass |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=34–39 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816182350/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/politicization_of_scientific_issues |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politicization of science is usually accomplished when scientific information is presented in a way that emphasizes the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolsen|first1=Toby|last2=Druckman|first2=James N.|title=Counteracting the Politicization of Science|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2015|issue=65|page=746}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tactics such as shifting conversation, failing to acknowledge facts, and capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence.&lt;ref name = "Freudenberg 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freudenberg|first1=William F.|title=Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs): Science and the Politics of Doubt|journal=Sociological Inquiry|volume=78|pages=2–38|doi=10.1111/j.1475-682X.2008.00219|doi-broken-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of issues that have involved the politicization of science include the [[global warming controversy]], [[health effects of pesticides]], and [[health effects of tobacco]].&lt;ref name = "Freudenberg 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "van Der Linden2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van der Linden|first1=Sander|last2=Leiserowitz|first2=Anthony|last3=Rosenthal|first3=Seth|last4=Maibach|first4=Edward|title=Inoculating the Public against Misinformation about Climate Change|journal=Global Challenges|volume=1|issue=2|page=1|doi=10.1002/gch2.201600008|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shabbir Akhtar''' (born 1960) is a philosopher, researcher and writer.  His interests include [[Islamism|political Islam]], [[Quran]]ic interpretation, revival of philosophical discourse in Islam, the thought of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], inter-faith dialogue as well as Islamic readings of the [[New Testament]].

==Personal life==
Shabbir Akhtar was born in [[Pakistan]], raised in [[Bradford, England|Bradford]] in the United Kingdom and went to Canada for higher education.

==Education==
After studying philosophy (BA and MA degrees) at [[Cambridge university|Cambridge]], Shabbir got a PhD in [[philosophy of religion]] from the [[university of Calgary]] (1984), his thesis being entitled: "Religion in the age of reason : faith and the apostasy of humanism."

==Career==
*1994 to 1997 – [[International Islamic University Malaysia|International Islamic University]], Malaysia
*2002 to 2011 – Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the [[Old Dominion University]]

His first book, ''Reason and the Radical Crisis of Faith'' (1987), on the possibilities and complexities of upholding faith in a [[secular society]], was described by [[anti-theist]] author Keith Parsons as "to be widely read. He argues with insight, wit, and lucidity. His arguments gain a special cogency from the scrupulous fairness with which Akhtar treats those whom he criticizes."&lt;ref&gt; Keith M. Parsons , "''Reason and the Radical Crisis of Faith''. Shabbir Akhtar ," ''The Journal of Religion'' 69, no. 2 (Apr. 1989): 273.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the publication of ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' by [[Salman Rushdie]], Akhtar represented the Bradford Council of Mosques in the ensuing media interest in the reactions of the Muslim community in the United Kingdom. On 27 February 1989 he published an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', in which he stated: "there is no choice in the matter. Anyone who fails to be offended by Rushdie's book ipso facto ceases to be a Muslim...Those Muslims who find it intolerable to live in a United Kingdom contaminated with the Rushdie virus need to seriously consider the Islamic alternatives of emigration (''[[Hijra (Islam)|hijrah]]'') to the House of Islam or a declaration of holy war (''[[jihād]]'') on the House of Rejection."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J5RGlpx0j8sC&amp;pg=PA390 Michael M. J. Fischer, Mehdi Abedi. ''Debating Muslims: Cultural Dialogues in Postmodernity and Tradition'']. Univ of Wisconsin Press (1990): p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; The article also included the much-quoted sentence: "The next time there are gas chambers in Europe, there is no doubt concerning who'll be inside them."&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=36sKIma5E34C&amp;pg=PA74 Malise Ruthven "Islam in the Media"] in ''Interpreting Islam'' Ed. Hastings Donnan. SAGE Publications (2002): p. 74; Kenan Malik. ''From Fatwa to Jihad''. Atlantic Books, London (2009): p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, he taught philosophy in Malaysia but came back disillusioned of the belief that a majority Muslim society would really pursue reason in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Subki Bin Ahmad|title=Cooperative society |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/cooperative-society/103830.article|work=[[Times Higher Education]]| date=29 September 1997 |accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, he has published books that are philosophical in approach and strident in presenting a certain point of view and trying to lay the foundation of modern Islamic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11841-010-0194-4 Review of Shabbir Akhtar, The Quran and the Secular Mind: A Philosophy of Islam – Springer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Concept of Anxiety''''' ({{lang-da|Begrebet Angest}}): ''A Simple Psychologically Orienting Deliberation on the Dogmatic Issue of Hereditary Sin'', is a philosophical work written by [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in 1844.  The original 1944 English translation by [[Walter Lowrie (author)|Walter Lowrie]] (now [[out of print]]), had the title '''''The Concept of Dread'''''.&lt;ref&gt;The book is available on Questia: [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=94976006 The Concept of Dread, by Walter Lowrie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegard wrote again about dread in his 1847 book, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', translated by Howard Hong&lt;blockquote&gt;Alas, although many call themselves Christians and yet may seem to be living in uncertainty as to whether God actually is love, it would truly be better if they made the love blaze just by the thought of paganism’s horror: that he who holds the fate of everything and also your fate in his hand is ambivalent, that his love is not a fatherly embrace but a constraining trap, that his secret nature is not eternal clarity but concealment, that the deepest ground of his nature is not love but a cunning impossible to understand. We are not, after all, required to be able to understand the rule of God’s love, but we certainly are required to be able to believe and, believing, to understand that he is love. It is not dreadful that you are unable to understand God’s decrees if he nevertheless is eternal love, but it is dreadful if you could not understand them because he is cunning. If, however, according to the assumption of the discourse, it is true that in relation to God a person is not only always in the wrong but is always guilty and thus when he suffers also suffers as guilty-then no doubt within you (provided you yourself will not sin again) and no event outside you (provided you yourself will not sin again by taking offense) can displace the joy.  Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 267-269&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Concept of Anxiety'' was dedicated "to the late professor [[Poul Martin Møller]]". He used the [[pseudonym]] Vigilius Haufniensis (which, according to Kierkegaard scholar Josiah Thompson, is the Latin transcription for "the Watchman"&lt;ref&gt;Prefaces/Writing Sampler, Nichol p. 33-34, 68 ''The Concept of Anxiety'' p. 115-116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard presents and Either/Or here: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. If I say to the wicked, `You shall surely die,' and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you will have saved your life. Again, if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand. Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and you will have saved your life." Ezekiel 3:17–19 The Bible&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; "The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self-controlled so that you can pray. Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms. If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen. Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you." 1 Peter 4:7-12 [[Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]] &lt;/blockquote&gt;  http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=DIV1&amp;byte=3114629&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Copenhagen]]) for ''The Concept of Anxiety''.&lt;ref&gt;''Kierkegaard'' Josiah Thomson Alfred A Knopf 1973 p. 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Kierkegaard's books have either a preface, dedication, or prayer at the beginning. This book includes a lengthy introduction. ''The Concept of Anxiety'' was published on exactly the same date as ''Prefaces'', June 17, 1844. Both books deal with [[Hegel]]’s idea of mediation. Mediation is a common thread throughout Kierkegaard’s works. His work up to this point was to show that faith was being mediated by knowledge. Here he takes up the questions of sin and guilt.

For Kierkegaard, [[anxiety]]/[[Existential dread|dread]]/[[angst]] is unfocused fear. Kierkegaard uses the example of a man standing on the edge of a tall building or cliff. When the man looks over the edge, he experiences a focused fear of falling, but at the same time, the man feels a terrifying impulse to throw himself intentionally off the edge. That experience is anxiety or dread because of our complete freedom to choose to either throw oneself off or to stay put. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Kierkegaard called this our "dizziness of freedom."

Kierkegaard focuses on the first anxiety experienced by man: [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s choice to eat from God's forbidden tree of knowledge or not. Since the concepts of good and evil did not come into existence before Adam ate the fruit, Adam had no concept of good and evil, and did not know that eating from the tree was "evil." What he did know was that God told him not to eat from the tree. The anxiety comes from the fact that God's prohibition itself implies that Adam is free and that he could choose to obey God or not. After Adam ate from the tree, sin was born. So, according to Kierkegaard, anxiety precedes sin. Kierkegaard mentions that anxiety is the presupposition for hereditary sin (which Augustine was the first to call ''peccatum originale'', "original sin").

However, Kierkegaard mentions that anxiety is a way for humanity to be saved as well. Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. ([[Jean-Paul Sartre]] calls these terms pre-reflective consciousness and reflective consciousness.)&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard wrote against prereflection and how it can keep the single individual from acting in his book ''Two Ages, The Age of Revolution and the Present Age, A Literary Review'', 1845, Hong 1978, 2009 p. 67-68&lt;/ref&gt; An individual becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of anxiety. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms. Alternatively, sin exists in the very resolution of anxiety through right and wrong; why to embrace anxiety is to not pass judgement.

==Progress==
[[File:Kant foto.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Immanuel Kant 1724–1804]]In 1793, forty-one years before Kierkegaard wrote ''The Concept of Anxiety'', [[Immanuel Kant]] wrote his book ''[[Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone]]''; his book elevated reason in the realm of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staffweb.hkbu.edu.hk/ppp/rbbr/toc.html Immanuel Kant, ''Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone''].&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] wrote their books in relation to Kant's ideas. Kierkegaard was familiar with ''Book Two'' of Kant's book ''The Conflict of the Good with the Evil Principle for Sovereignty over Man''&lt;ref&gt;[http://staffweb.hkbu.edu.hk/ppp/rbbr/rbbr2.html ''Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone'': Book Two]&lt;/ref&gt; and he made a similar study in this book; however, he might call it the conflict of ethics and anxiety for sovereignty over man. Kierkegaard would replace Kant's term "Good" with "Ethics" and his term "Evil" with "Anxiety about the [[Summum bonum|Good]]". He wrote about the ideal good versus the actual good that a single individual can do in the following way: "Ethics proposes to bring ideality into actuality. On the other hand, it is not the nature of its movement to raise actuality up into ideality. Ethics points to ideality as a task and assumes that every man possesses the requisite conditions. Thus ethics develops a contradiction, inasmuch as it makes clear both the difficulty and the impossibility."&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'', Nichol p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He was wondering how any existing human being can make any movement in an ideal world.

[[File:Johann Friedrich Herbart.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Johann Herbart 1776–1841]][[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|130px|Søren Kierkegaard 1813–1855]]Kierkegaard begins this book with a short [[preface]]. By now he expects his readers to be aware that the preface is a key to the meaning of the book. Haufniensis uses the word "generation' several times as well as "epoch" and "era" in his introduction to prepare the reader for his subject. [[Idea of Progress|Progress]] from the "first science", [[ethics]], to the "second science", [[psychology]]. [[Historian]]s, [[History#History|psychologists]], [[History of anthropology|anthropologists]], [[Theology#Theology and ministerial training|theologians]] and [[Philosophy#17th–20th centuries|philosophers]] were all in agreement that the past must be preserved if there is to be a future for humankind. These [[soft sciences]] were of interest to Kierkegaard only in so far as they related to the progress of Christianity. His preface is followed by his first [[Introduction (essay)|introduction]] since he published his [[thesis]], ''[[The Concept of Irony]]''. It could mark a new beginning but that is not known for certain.

[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling.png|thumb|left|130px|Friedrich Schelling 1775–1854]][[File:Hegel 042.jpg|thumb|130px|Georg Hegel (1770–1831)]][[Friedrich Schelling]] wrote ''[[Philosophical Inquiries into the Essence of Human Freedom]]'' in 1809, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] wrote his ''[[Science of Logic]]'' between 1812 and 1816,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hl/hlconten.htm Marxist.org] for Hegel's book&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]]&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard discusses Hebart in relation to the question of whether an individual would begin with the negative or the positive. &lt;blockquote&gt;In his treatise ''De affectionbus'' (The Affections), [[Descartes]] calls attention to the fact that every passion has a corresponding passion; only with wonder that is not the case. The detailed exposition is rather weak, but it has been of interest to me that he makes an exception of wonder, because, as is well known, according to Plato’s and Aristotle’s views precisely this constitutes the passion of philosophy and the passion which all philosophizing began. Moreover, envy corresponds to wonder, and recent philosophy would also speak of doubt. Precisely in this lies the fundamental error of recent philosophy, that it wants to begin with the negative instead of the positive, which always is the first, in the same sense ''affirmatio'' [affirmation] is placed first in the declaration ''omnis affirmatio est nagatio'' [every affirmation is a [[negation]]]. The question of whether the positive or the negative comes first is exceedingly important, and the only modern philosopher who has declared himself for the positive is presumably Herbart. ''The Concept of Anxiety'' Thomte p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt; wrote about [[pedagogy]]. All of them were discussing how [[good and evil]] come into existence. Kierkegaard questioned Hegel and Schelling's emphasis on the negative (evil) and aligned himself with Hebart's emphasis on the positive (good). Kierkegaard says "anxiety about sin produces sin"&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard had already discussed this in his first unpublished book, ''Johannes Climacus'', in Chapter 2,  Philosophy Begins With Doubt, (Croxall translation): here he compares the positive principle with the negative principle and wonder with doubt. see pages 49ff here is the book from Goodreads [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1788968.Johannes_Climacus ''Johannes Climacus'']&lt;/ref&gt; in this book and later says it again: {{Quotation|Repentance is a recollection of guilt. From a purely [[psychological]] point of view, I really believe that the police aid the criminal in not coming to repent. By continually recounting and repeating his life experiences, the criminal becomes such a memory expert at rattling off his life that the ideality of recollection is driven away. Really to [[repent]], and especially to repent at once, takes enormous ideality; therefore nature also can help a person, and delayed repentance, which in regard to remembering is negligible, is often the hardest and deepest. The ability to recollect is the condition for all productivity. If a person no longer wishes to be productive, he needs merely to remember the same thing that recollecting he wanted to produce, and production is rendered impossible, or it will become so repulsive to him that the sooner he abandons it the better. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Stages on Life’s Way'', [[Preface]], Hong p. 14 (1845)}}

All of them were involved with the [[dialectical]] question of exactly "how" an individual, or group, or race changes from good to evil or evil to good. Kierkegaard pressed forward with his category of "the single individual."&lt;ref&gt;See Soren Kierkegaard's 1847 book ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' 141–154 Hong translation&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard's Introduction is in Primary sources below.

And, since it is God, who, through the consciousness of sin, binds every individual person to Christianity, so it must be assumed that he also determines every man’s conflicts individually.

==Anxiety==
[[File:Pedro Américo - Faust and Gretchen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Faust and [[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy#Gretchen's Tragedy|Gretchen]]]] Many men and women are anxious about whom they should [[marriage|marry]] and how they will pick the right person. The anxious person stands at the crossroads and wonders which way to go. Kierkegaard captured the sentiment in his book ''[[Either/Or]]'', which is filled with examples of people at the crossroads. [[Johann Goethe]] (1749–1832) was at a crossroads and couldn't make up his mind about what he wanted so he talked to the devil about it in his play ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''. [[Adam Oehlenschläger]] (1779–1850) wrote a book about a single individual wanting to get married in his book ''[[Aladdin#Sources and setting|Aladdin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/aladdinorwonder00oehlgoog#page/n5/mode/2up ''Aladdin''] Archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; He let a [[genie]] make up his mind for him.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong p. 163ff&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard points out that [[Isaac#Family life|Isaac]] didn't have freedom to choose his wife either. He wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;[[File:RebeccaAtTheWell Giovanni.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Rebecca]] at the well]]Isaac presumably dared with a certain degree of assurance to expect that God would surely choose a wife for him who was young and beautiful and highly regarded by the people and lovable in every way, but nevertheless we lack the erotic, even if it was the case that he loved this one chosen of God with all the passion of youth. Freedom was lacking. ''Either/Or II'', Hong p 44&lt;/blockquote&gt; Isaac had expectations, but he didn't have an easy time just because God made his choice for him. Both freedom and anxiety were absent in these examples of three personal choices but ignorance was present because none of them were personally involved in a very important decision.

Neither Goethe nor Oehlenschlager tells the reader if Faust or Alladin was faithful to the one chosen for him, they just end the story. But Isaac's story continued and showed that he was faithful to the choice made for him. Kierkegaard questions how a person can remain faithful to a choice that is made by others? The others are external powers whereas his spirit is an internal power. All three stories deal with the world of the spirit. Kierkegaard thinks the "spirit is a hostile and a friendly power at the same time". He wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"That anxiety makes its appearance is pivotal. Man is a synthesis of the psychical and the physical; however, a synthesis is unthinkable if the two are not united in a third. This third is [[spirit]]. In innocence, man is not merely animal, for if he were at any moment of his life merely animal, he would never become man. So spirit is present, but is immediate, as dreaming. It is in a sense a hostile power, for it constantly disturbs the relation between soul and body, a relation that indeed has persistence and yet does not have endurance, inasmuch as it first receives the latter by the spirit. On the other hand, spirit is a friendly power, since it is precisely that which constitutes the relation. What, then, is man’s relation to this ambiguous power? How does spirit relate itself to itself and to its conditionality? It relates itself as anxiety. Do away with itself, the spirit cannot; lay hold of itself, it cannot, as long as it has itself outside itself. Nor can man sink down into the vegetative, for he is qualified as spirit; flee away from anxiety, he cannot, for he loves it; really love it, he cannot, for he flees from it. Innocence has now reached its uttermost point. It is ignorance; however, it is not an animal brutality but an ignorance qualified as spirit, and as such innocence is precisely anxiety, because its ignorance is about nothing. Here there is no knowledge of good and evil etc., but the whole actuality of knowledge projects itself in anxiety as the enormous nothing of ignorance. ''The Concept of Anxiety'', p. 43–44&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This "ambiguous power" is discussed further in Kierkegaard's 1847 book ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' and his 1848 book ''Christian Discourses''&lt;ref&gt;see the complete list of Kierkegaard's works here from David F. Bishop's website [http://www.kierkegaard.com/chrono.html Chronology of Kierkegaard's works]&lt;/ref&gt; where he finds himself standing against his own best intentions. {{Quotation|The person who is to be master (it is, of course, he himself) ruins it; such a person works with perhaps scarcely a third of his power in the right place and with more than two-thirds of his power in the wrong place or against himself. Now he gives up working in order to begin to deliberate all over again, now he works in instead of deliberating, now he pulls on the reins in the wrong way, now he wants to do both at the same time-and during all this he does not move from the spot. During all this, his life comes to a standstill, as it were; he cannot get the task firmly set, so that it stands firm, so that he is able to tear himself away from this work and have his strength available to carry out the task. The task does not become a burden, but he is swamped with the burdensome muddling with the task in order to get it, if possible to stand firm. When this is so, he naturally never gets around to carrying the burden; after all, he cannot even get it to stand still; the moment he wants to turn his back, as it were, in order to pick up the burden, the burden seems to tumble down and he has to stack it up again. Ah, if one looks at people’s lives, one often must say in sorrow: They do not themselves know what powers they have; they more or less keep themselves from finding that out, because they are using most of their powers to work against themselves. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' Hong p. 295-296}}

Kierkegaard was interested in how an individual can keep faith awake and hope alive. {{Quotation|Prayer: Thou my God and Father! The question of my salvation concerns no other being but me-and thee. Should there then not remain uncertainty in fear and trembling until the last, I being what I am, and thou what thou art, I on earth, thou in heaven-a difference infinitely great-I a sinner, thou the Holy One? Should there not, ought there not, must there not, be fear and trembling till the last? Was it not the fault of the [[Parable of the Ten Virgins|foolish virgins]] that they became sure, and went to sleep; while the wise virgins kept awake? But what is it to keep awake? It is uncertainty in fear and trembling. And what is faith but an empty fantasy, if it be not awake? And when faith is not awake, what is it but that same pernicious feeling of security which ruined the foolish virgins?  ''[[Christian Discourses]]'', Lowrie 1939  p. 219, ''Meditations from Kierkegaard'', Translated and Edited by T.H. Croxall, The Westminister Press, copyright 1955, by W. L. Jenkins p. 56–57}}

==Supernaturalism==
[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Brothers Grimm]]]]The Brothers Grimm were writing about the use of [[Folklore|folktales]] as educational stories to keep individuals from falling into evil hands. Kierkegaard refers to ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]'' in ''The Concept of Anxiety'' (p.&amp;nbsp;155). Can the "power of the example",&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'', Nichols p. 31, 55–56, 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; or [[theatre pedagogy]], or the [[theatre of the absurd]], help an individual learn how to find the good? [[Danish folklore]] was at this time also coming to the attention of [[Pedagogy|pedagogs]]. Imagination can be of assistance but it can also keep an individual from making crucial decisions. But failing to "become honest with yourself so that you do not deceive yourself with imagined power, with which you experience imagined victory in imagined struggle" is how a decision can become an impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]&lt;/ref&gt;

What's keeping him from making the decision? [[Nothing]] except the [[imagination]] of the individual involved in making the decision, imaginations of guilt and sin and fear and rejection.&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'', Nichols p. 41-45&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' Abraham had to choose to follow God or call him a monster. In ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]'' the Young Man had to choose to get married or to follow his love of writing. Both were "imaginative constructions"&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript,'' Hong p. 113-115&lt;/ref&gt; created by Kierkegaard that dealt with [[hope]] and [[love]].

[[File:Erlkoenig Schwind.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Erlking]]]]Kierkegaard felt that imaginative constructions should be upbuilding. Kierkegaard wrote about "the nothing of despair",&lt;ref&gt;Either/Or Part II p. 198-199&lt;/ref&gt; God as the unknown is nothing,&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Fragments'', Swenson p. 30, The Concept of Anxiety p. 12-13, Three Discourses On Imagined Occasions, Søren Kierkegaard, June 17, 1844,  Hong 1993 p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; and death is a nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Three Discourses On Imagined Occasions, p.90-97&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Der Erlkönig]]'' and ''The Bride of Corinth'' (1797)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vampires.com/the-bride-of-corinth/ The Vampire Female: ''The Bride of Corinth''] (1797)
by: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&lt;/ref&gt; are also nothing. The single individual has a reality which [[fiction]] can never represent. People should learn the difference between imaginary constructions and reality. Many things are hard to understand but Kierkegaard says, "Where [[understanding]] despairs, faith is already present in order to make the despair properly decisive."&lt;ref&gt;Concluding Unscientific Postscript, p. 220-230&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|God grant, that all [[playwright]]s compose nothing but tearjerking plays, full of all possible anxiety and horror that would not allow your flabbiness to rest on the cushioned theater seats and let you be perfumed with [[Paranormal|supranatural]] power but would horrify you until in the world of actuality you learn to believe in that which you want to believe in only in poetry. ''Either/Or Part II'' p. 122}}

==The first sin==
[[File:Adam and Eve by George Hayter.jpg|thumb|300px|Adam and Eve]]
Kierkegaard is not concerned with what Eve's sin was, he says it wasn't sensuousness,&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'' p. 57-60&lt;/ref&gt; but he is concerned with how [[Adam and Eve|Eve]] learned that she was a sinner. He says "[[consciousness]] [[Presupposition|presuppose]]s itself.&lt;ref&gt;Journals and Papers, Hannay, 1996 1843 IVA49&lt;/ref&gt; Eve became conscious of her first sin through her choice and Adam became conscious of his first sin through his choice. God's gift to Adam and Eve was the "knowledge of freedom" and they both decided to use it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'' p. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; In Kierkegaard's Journals he said,  "the one thing needful" for the doctrine of [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]] to make sense was the "anguished conscience." He wrote, "Remove the anguished conscience, and you may as well close the churches and turn them into dance halls."&lt;ref&gt;''Journals of Søren Kierkegaard,'' VIII 1A 192 (1846) (''Works of Love''), Hong p. 407&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Domenico Fetti - The Parable of the Mote and the Beam.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[The Mote and the Beam|Parable of the Mote and Beam]]]]Kierkegaard says, every person has to find out for him or her self how guilt and sin came into their worlds. Kierkegaard argued about this in both ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]'' and ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' where he said philosophy must not define faith.&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'' p. 29-31, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Two Upbuilding Discourses'', 1843, Hong p. 11-14&lt;/ref&gt; He asks his reader, the single individual, to consider some questions. Can sin and guilt be transferred from one person to another? Is it "an epidemic that spreads like [[cowpox]]"?&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'' p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Was every Jewish person responsible for the crucifixion of Christ?&lt;ref&gt;''Either/Or Part II'', Hong p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Does the single individual find sin in others or in him or herself?&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'' P. 109, ''Concluding Postscript'', Hong p. 259, 322–323&lt;/ref&gt; He believed in a rigorous self-inspection and at the same time a lenient inspection of others. He put it this way in ''Four Upbuilding Discourses of 1844'': {{Quotation|We do not know the life of [[Apostle Paul|Paul]] in great detail, but we do, however, know Paul, which is the main consideration. That is to say, just as the sensate man is distinguishable by his seeing the speck in his brother’s eye but not seeing the log in his own, by his rigorously condemning the same fault in others that he lightly forgives in himself, so the mark of a more profound and concerned person is that he judges himself more rigorously, uses all his ingenuity to excuse the other person but is unable to excuse or forgive himself, indeed, is convinced that the other one is more excusable, because there is always still a possibility, since the only one in relation to whom a person is deprived of this possibility is he himself. Bold confidence is a difficult matter, because it is not exactly synonymous with mental weakness. One may very well stop with it and need not go further by even wishing to judge God, that is, if in other respects bold confidence is bold confidence in the judgment, which certainly requires that God’s judgment penetrate the thought and heart, that is, if it is bold confidence in God’s mercy and there words are not a feigned pious expression of one’s own thoughtlessness, which does not trust God but is consoled by having ceased to sorrow long ago. If no human being is capable of acquitting himself he is capable of one thing-of indicting himself so terribly that he cannot acquit himself but learns to need mercy. With regard to this, it is difficult for one person to understand another, because the earnest person always lays the stress on himself. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 339-340}}

What was the intention of Christianity? Does the concept emerge through definitions and examples? Sin and guilt are both religious categories as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. He wrote:{{Quotation|The concept of guilt as a totality-category belong essentially in the religious sphere. As soon as the esthetic wants to have something to do with it, this concept becomes dialectical like fortune and misfortune, whereby everything is confused. Esthetically, the dialectic of guilt is this: the individual is without [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], then guilt and guiltlessness come along as alternating categories of life; at times the individual is guilty of this or that and at times is not guilty. If this or that had not been, the individual would not have become guilty; in other circumstances, one who is not considered as being without guilt would have become guilty. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', (1846) Hong p. 525-537}}
{{Quotation|With the help of faith, anxiety brings up the individuality to rest in providence. So it is also in relation to guilt, which is the second thing anxiety discovers. Whoever learns to know his guilt only from the finite is lost in the finite, and finitely the question of whether a man is guilty cannot be determined except in an external, juridical, and most imperfect sense. Whoever learns to know his guilt only by analogy to judgments of the police court and the supreme court never really understands that he is guilty, for if a man is guilty, he is infinitely guilty. Therefore, if such an individuality who is educated only by finitude does not get a verdict from the police or a verdict by public opinion to the effect that he is guilty, he becomes of all men the most ridiculous and pitiful, a model of virtue who is a little better than most people but not quite so good as the parson. What help would such a man need in life? Søren Kierkegaard, ''The Concept of Anxiety'', Thomte p. 161}}

Kierkegaard observes that it was the prohibition itself not to eat of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|tree of knowledge]] that gave birth to sin in Adam. The prohibition [[Instinct#In psychology|predisposes]] that which breaks forth in Adam's [[Leap of faith|qualitative leap]].&lt;ref&gt;The Concept of Anxiety, p. 39, Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'', 1847 Hong 1995 p. 297-298&lt;/ref&gt; He questions the doctrine of [[Original Sin]], also called [[Ancestral sin]]., "The doctrine that [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament#New Adam / Second Adam|Adam and Christ correspond to each other]] confuses things. Christ alone is an [[individual]] who is [[God in Christianity|more than an individual]]. For this reason he does not come in the beginning but in the fullness of time."&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'' Note p. 33, There is an eternal difference between Christ and every Christian. Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, Hong 1995 p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Sin has a "[[Coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] in itself".&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' p. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Philosophical Fragments'' Kierkegaard described the [[Philosophical Fragments#A Project of Thought|Learner in Error before God]]. Here he questions how the Learner discovers this Error. New sciences were emerging that challenged the conventional ethics of the time as well as the notions of guilt and sin. Kierkegaard described the struggle elegantly. He says, &lt;blockquote&gt;"[[Ethics]] and [[dogma]]tics struggle over [[Reconciliation (theology)|reconciliation]] in a border area fraught with [[Destiny|fate]].

And now what will be the result?" and "[[Innocence]] is [[ignorance]], but how is it lost?" The Concept of Anxiety'' P. 12, 39&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaard also writes about an individual's [[disposition]] in ''The Concept of Anxiety''. He was impressed with the [[psychological]] views of [[Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz]] who wrote: {{Quotation|In Rosenkranz’s ''Psychology'' there is definition of disposition [''Gemyt'']. On page 322 he says that disposition is the unity of feeling and self-consciousness. Then in preceding presentation he superbly explains "that the feeling unfolds itself to self-consciousness, and vice versa, that the content of the self-consciousness is felt by the subject as his own. It is only this unity that can be called disposition. If the clarity of cognition is lacking, knowledge of the feeling, there exists only the urge of the spirit of nature, the turgidity of immediacy. On the other hand, if feeling is lacking, there remains only the abstract concept that has not reached the last inwardness of the spiritual existence, that has not become one with the self of the spirit." (cf. pp. 320–321) If a person now turns back and pursues his definition of "feeling" as the spirit’s immediate unity of its sentience and its consciousness (p. 142) and recalls that in the definition of ''Seelenhaftigkeit'' [sentience] account has been taken of the unity with the immediate determinants of nature, then by taking all this together he has the conception of a concrete personality. [but, Kierkegaard says] Earnestness and disposition correspond to each other in such a way that earnestness is a higher as well as the deepest expression for what disposition is. Disposition is the earnestness of immediacy, while earnestness, on the other hand, is the acquired originality of disposition, its originality preserved in the responsibility of freedom and its originality affirmed in the enjoyment of blessedness.

[[File:P46.jpg|thumb|left|130px|A [[Philosophical Fragments|fragment]] of the [[Epistle to the Galatians]]]]Kierkegaard believed "each [[generation]] has its own task and need not trouble itself unduly by being [[Theory of everything#Theory of everything and philosophy|everything]] to previous and succeeding generations".&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'' P. 7 and ''Either/Or Part II'', Hong p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; In an earlier book he had said, "to a certain degree every generation and every individual begins his life from the beginning",&lt;ref&gt;''Either/Or Part II'', Hong p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; and in another, "no generation has learned to love from another, no generation is able to begin at any other point than the beginning", "no generation learns the essentially human from a previous one.&lt;ref&gt;Fear and Trembling p. 121-123&lt;/ref&gt; He was against the [[Hegelian]] idea of [[mediation]]&lt;ref&gt;''Either/Or Part II'', Hong p. 170-176, ''The Concept of Anxiety'' P. 11-13 including note,&lt;/ref&gt; because it introduces a "third term"&lt;ref&gt;''Johannes Climacus'', by Søren Kierkegaard, Edited and Introduced by Jane Chamberlain, Translated by T.H.

In other words, does Christianity say to first teach about "the works of the flesh" (the negative) or about the "[[Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]" (the positive)?&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=DIV1&amp;byte=5320346 Galatians 5:19–24 The Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;  Does the answer lie in the world of the spirit or in the world of temporality? Should we always go backwards to review the negative or forward because we are concentrating on the positive. Or should there be a balance between the two? And he just puts the question out there as part of the "great dialogue of science" for consideration. He began this discussion in his ''[[Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843#The Expectancy of Faith|Two Upbuilding Discourses of 1843]]'' in ''Galatians'' chapter 3 (''There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus'').

{{Quotation|The individual does not relate himself to the ideal through the generation or the state or the century or the market price of human beings in the city where he lives-that is, by these things he is prevented from relating himself to the ideal-but relates himself to it even though he errs in his understanding of it. …  Because of the jumbling together of the idea of the state, of sociality, of community, and of society, God can no longer catch hold of the single individual. … The immorality of our age could easily become a fantastical-ethical debilitation, the disintegration of a sensual, soft despair, in which individuals grope as in a dream for a concept of God without feeling any terror in so doing. God in the indefinite. … Let us sin, sin outright, seduce girls, murder men, rob on the highway-that at least can be repented, and God can at least catch hold of such a criminal. Let us mock God outright, this is always preferable to the debilitating importance with which one wants to demonstrate the existence of God. One demonstrates the existence of God by worship-not by demonstrations. Søren Kierkegaard ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 543-545}}

Kierkegaard is wondering if one generation can learn wonder, love, anxiety, peace, patience, hope, from a previous generation or if each "single individual" in each generation must learn these things, for the most part, on their own. He asked the same question in [[Philosophical Fragments#The Disciple and the Disciple at Second Hand|Philosophical Fragments]] about how someone learns to become a [[Christian]]. Are we Christian because of our family and personal history or because we have made a "decisive resolution"? What kind of goods is the Christian looking to gain? Isn't hope a good and despair an evil in yourself that you work to change into the good called hope? Isn't patience a good and impatience an evil that can be changed if you want to change it? Isn't your soul a good? Is the soul given to the chosen few or is it given as a free gift to all, without merit? {{#tag:ref|"If a person is unwilling to make a decisive resolution, if he wants to cheat God of the heart’s daring venture in which a person ventures way out and loses sight of all shrewdness and probability, indeed, takes leave of his senses or at least all his worldly mode of thinking, if instead of beginning with one step he almost craftily seeks to find out something, to have the infinite certainty changed into a finite certainty, then this discourse will not be able to benefit him. There is an upside-downness that wants to reap before it sows; there is a cowardliness that wants to have certainty before it begins. There is a hypersensitivity so copious in words that it continually shrinks from acting; but what would it avail a person if, [[Double-mindedness|double-minded]] and fork-tongued he wanted to dupe God, trap him in probability, but refused to understand the improbable, that one must lose everything in order to gain everything, and understand it so honestly that, in the most crucial moment, when his soul is already shuddering at the risk, he does not again leap to his own aid with the explanation that he has not yet fully made a resolution but merely wanted to feel his way. Therefore, all discussion of struggling with God in prayer, of the actual loss (since if pain of annihilation is not actually suffered, then the sufferer is not yet out upon the deep, and his scream is not the scream of danger but in the face of danger) and the figurative victory cannot have the purpose of persuading anyone or of converting the situation into a task for secular appraisal and changing God’s gift of grace to the venture into temporal small change for the timorous. It really would not help a person if the speaker, by his oratorical artistry, led him to jump into a half hour’s resolution, by the ardor of conviction started a fire in him so that he would blaze in a momentary good intention without being able to sustain a resolution or to nourish an intention as soon as the speaker stopped talking. 
*''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong, One Who Prays Aright Struggles In Prayer and is Victorious-In That God is Victorious p. 380-381|group="nb"|name=""}} Is our future a matter of fate, of choice, or a combination of both? Kierkegaard answers this way: {{Quotation|If a person does not first make clear to himself the meaning of "self," it is of no use to say of sin that it is selfishness. Only when the concept of the particular is given can there be any talk of selfishness, however, no science can say what the self is without stating it quite generally. And this is the wonder of life, that each man who is mindful of himself knows what no science knows, since he knows who he himself is, and this is the profundity of the Greek saying know yourself, which too long has been understood in the German way as pure self-consciousness, the airiness of idealism. It is about time to seek to understand it in the Greek way, and then again as the Greeks would have understood it if they had possessed Christian presuppositions. However, the real "[[self]]" is posited only by the [[Leap of faith|qualitative leap]]. In the prior state there can be no question about it. Therefore, when sin is explained by selfishness, one becomes entangled in indistinctness because, on the contrary, it is by sin and in sin that selfishness comes into being.

Indeed, what is more, if the soul is this contradiction, it can be possessed only in such a way that it is gained and gained in such a way that it is possessed. The person who possesses the external does not need to gain it-in fact, he is even unable to do that. He can give away what he possesses and then see whether he can gain the same thing again; he can use what he possesses to gain something new, but he cannot simultaneously possess and gain the very same thing. ... If the person who wants to gain his soul does not want to understand that when he has won patience he has won what he needed, what was of more value than any other winning, then he will never gain it. It is already obvious here how secure this gain is, since in a profound sense it is so cunning that the more the world deceives, the more patience wins. In this gain, the very condition is also the object and is independent of anything external. The condition, therefore, after it has served the gaining, remains as that which is gained; this is different from what happens when the merchant sold his merchandise and the fisherman has caught his fish-they lay aside patience and also their tools so they may enjoy what they gained. In the external, patience is some third element that must be added, and, humanly speaking, it would be better if it were not needed; some days it is needed more, some days less, all according to fortune, whose debtor a person becomes, even though  he gained ever so little, because only when he wants to gain patience does he become one’s debtor.

In the former, the two factors are psyche and body, and spirit is the third, yet in such a way that one can speak of a synthesis only when the spirit is posited. The latter synthesis has only two factors, the temporal and the eternal. Where is the third factor? And if there is no third factor, there really is no synthesis, for a synthesis that is a contradiction cannot be completed as a synthesis without a third factor, because the fact that the synthesis is a contradiction asserts that it is not. What, then, is the temporal? ''The Concept of Anxiety'' p. 85
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''June 3 Midnight:'' So once again I am sitting on watch. If I were to say that to a third party, it no doubt would need an explanation, for it is readily understood that the pilot along the coast, the sentinel at the top of the tower, the lookout at the bow of a ship, and the robber in his lair sit and watch because there is something to watch for. But someone sitting alone in his room-for what can he be watching? And someone who anticipates that everything-that is, the minor little affair that everyone else would perhaps disregard-will pass quietly, he, of course, is on watch for nothing. No wonder it is a strain for his soul and his head, because to look for something is good for the eyes, but to look for nothing strains them. And when the eyes look for nothing for a long time they finally see themselves or their own seeing; in the same way the emptiness surrounding me presses my thinking back into myself. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong p.356-357&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Anxiety and nothing always correspond to each other. As soon as the actuality of freedom and of spirit is posited, anxiety is canceled. But what then does the [[nothing]] of [[anxiety]] signify more particularly in paganism. This is fate. Fate is a relation to spirit as external. It is the relation between spirit and something else that is not spirit and to which fate nevertheless stands in a spiritual relation. Fate may also signify exactly the opposite, because it is the unity of necessity and accidental. … A necessity that is not conscious of itself is ''[[eo ipso]]'' the accidental in relation to the next moment. Fate, then, is the nothing of anxiety. ''The Concept of Anxiety'' p. 96-97&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

==Eternity==
Kierkegaard repeats the synthesis again in ''The Sickness Unto Death''&lt;ref&gt;The Sickness Unto Death, Søren Kierkegaard, translated by [[Alastair Hannay]] 1989 p. 72ff  Despair viewed under the aspect of consciousness [http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2067&amp;C=1865  The Sickness Unto Death]&lt;/ref&gt;  and he tied it to his idea of the "Moment" from ''Philosophical Fragments''.&lt;ref&gt;Read about it here: [https://web.archive.org/web/20050114120045/http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2512&amp;C=2379 ''Philosophical Fragments'']&lt;/ref&gt; He says, "For the Greeks, the eternal lies behind as the past that can only be entered [[Eternal Return|backwards]]. The category I maintain should be kept in mind, repetition, by which eternity is entered forwards."  Kierkegaard wrote ''[[Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits]]'' in 1847. He said, "A [[Divine Providence|Providence]] watches over each man’s wandering through life. It provides him with two guides. The one calls him forward. The other calls him back. They are, however, not in opposition to each other, these two guides, nor do they leave the wanderer standing there in doubt, confused by the double call. Rather the two are in eternal understanding with each other. For the one beckons forward to the Good, the other calls man back from evil. These guides are called [[repentance]] and [[remorse]]. The eager traveler hurries forward to the new, to the novel, and, indeed, away from [[experience]]. But the remorseful one, who comes behind, laboriously gathers up experience.&lt;ref&gt;Read it here: [http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2523&amp;C=2388 ''Purity of Heart'']&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard also mentions this idea in his Journals. He wrote: "It is quite true what philosophy says; that life must be understood backwards. But then one forgets the other principle: that it must be lived forwards. Which principle, the more one thinks it through, ends exactly with the thought that temporal life can never properly be understood precisely because I can at no instant find complete rest in which to adopt a position: backwards.&lt;ref&gt;Journals IV A 164 (1843) See Kierkegaard: Papers and Journals, Translated by Alastair Hannay, 1996 P. 63 and 161&lt;/ref&gt;

The English poet [[Christina Rossetti]] said the same thing in her poem Advent: "The days are evil looking back, The coming days are dim; Yet count we not His promise slack, But watch and wait for Him."&lt;ref&gt;Poems of Christine Rossetti http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Poetry/christmastide_poems_of_christina.htm&lt;/ref&gt; If we want to look back to the age of [[Constantine The Great#Maximian's rebellion|Constantine The Great]] and start there in our search for Christianity we will go forward and think that an emperor can create millions of Christians by [[edict]]. Constantin Constantius wanted to do that in ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]''. [[Goethe]] wanted to start with the [[black plague]] in ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' or with the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Lisbon earthquake]] in his autobiography. These are negative beginnings. Both Rossetti and Kierkegaard take this present age as a starting point. Now the single individual interested in becoming a Christian can go forward toward a goal without continually looking over the shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;The individual is not a sinner from eternity, but is born as a sinner. The coming into existence make him into another person. This is the consequence of the appearance of the god in time, which prevents the individual from relating himself backward to the eternal, since he now moves forward in order to become eternal in time through the relation to the god in time. The individual is therefore unable to gain the consciousness of sin by himself.  ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' P. 583-584&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel looks at eternity as an unfolding, or a transition, from stage to stage, from the Persian, to the Syrian, to the Egyptian religion as Object, [[Form of the Good|Good]].&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, [https://archive.org/stream/lecturesonthephi02hegeuoft#page/n77/mode/2up Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion] p. 65ff&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard didn't want to be [[Double-mindedness|double-minded]] about the good, and, after his own fashion, created his own system of good in 1847 in ''Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits''. He brought eternity into relation with his own feelings of guilt in relation to [[Regine Olsen]], his fiancé, in ''Stages on Life's Way'' (1845) because he had so much anxiety about disclosing his inner being to her, it was "terrifying".&lt;ref&gt;See Stages on Life's Way, Hong p. 373-376&lt;/ref&gt; However, early on, Kierkegaard had written about moving forward in regard to himself, Regine, and any other single individual. He wrote the following in 1843 and 1845. {{Quotation|The healthy individual lives simultaneously in hope and in recollection, and only thereby does his life gain true and substantive continuity. Thus he has hope and therefore does not wish to go backward in time, as do those who live only in recollection. What, then, does recollection do for him, for it certainly must have some influence? It places a sharp on the note of the moment; the further back it goes, the more often the repetition, the more sharps there are. For example, if in the present year he experiences an erotic moment, this is augmented by his recollection of it in the previous year etc. … Hope hovers over it as a hope of eternity that fills out the moment. Søren Kierkegaard, 1843, ''Either/Or Part II'', Hong p. 142-143}} {{Quotation|Compared with eternity, is time the stronger? Has time the power to separate us eternally? I thought it had only the power to make me unhappy within time but would have to release me the instant I exchange time for eternity and am where she is, for eternally she is continually with me. If so, then what is time? It was that we two did not see each other last evening, and if she found another, it was that we two did not see each other last evening because she was out somewhere else. And whose fault was that? Yes, the fault was mine. But would I or could I nevertheless act in any other way than I have acted if the first is assumed to have happened? No! I regret the first. From that moment on, I have acted according to the most honest deliberation and to the best of my ability, as I also had done the first, until I perceived my error. But does eternity speak so frivolously about guilt? At least time does not; it will no doubt still teach what it has taught me, that a life is something more than last evening. But eternity will, of course, also heal all sickness, give hearing to the deaf, give sight to the blind and physical beauty to the deformed; hence it will also heal me. What is my sickness? Depression. Where does this sickness have its seat? In the power of the imagination, and possibility is its nourishment. But eternity takes away possibility. And was not this sickness oppressive enough in time-that I not only suffered but also became guilty of it? After all, the deformed person only has to bear the pain of being deformed, but how terrible if being deformed made him guilty! So when time is over for me, let my last sigh be to you, O God, for my soul’s salvation; let the next to last be for her, or let me for the first time be united with her again in the same last sigh! Søren Kierkegaard, ''Stages on Life's Way'' p. 390-391}}

==Criticism==
Walter Lowrie translated ''The Concept of Dread'' in 1944. He was asked "almost petulantly" why it took him so long to translate the book. Alexander Dru had been working on the book and [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]] hoped the book would be published along with ''The Sickness Unto Death'', which Lowrie was working on in 1939. Then the war started and Dru was wounded and gave the job over to Lowrie. Lowrie could find "no adequate word to use for ''Angst''. [[Lee Hollander]] had used the word dread in 1924, a Spanish translator used ''angustia'', and [[Miguel Unamuno]], writing in French used ''agonie'' while other French translators used ''angoisse''.&lt;ref&gt;The Concept of Dread, Walter Lowrie Princeton University May 26, 1943 his preface to the book&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rollo May]] quoted Kierkegaard in his book ''Meaning of Anxiety'', which is the relation between anxiety and freedom. {{Quotation|I would say that learning to know anxiety is an adventure which every man has to affront if he would not go to perdition either by not having known anxiety or by sinking under it. He therefore who has learned rightly to be anxious has learned the most important thing.— Kierkegaard, ''The Concept of Dread''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/meaningofanxiety00mayr Preface to ''Meaning of Anxiety'' &amp; p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The book seems to be highly interpretive in its title. Is it dread, anxiety, angst, or sin? Or is the final word of the title something else. It's up to the individual reader to determine that. If the single individual can't make a choice as to the meaning of a word then all choice has been taken away from the individual. Lowrie decided the book deals with "an apprehension of the future, a presentiment of a something which is a nothing" which must be fought against. But fought on the inside with oneself about what "you" as the single individual can become. Professor Lorraine Clark put it this way in 1991, "Existence is not just a given but also a ''task'', Kierkegaard insists-the task of ''becoming'' oneself; for "actuality (the historical actuality) relates itself in a two-fold way to the subject: partly as a gift which will not admit of being rejected, and partly as a task to be realized" (''Concept of Irony'', Hong p.&amp;nbsp;293). One cannot become all possibilities simultaneously in reality (however possible this may be in thought, as he readily acknowledges); one must become some one thing in particular. Otherwise, one remains abstract."&lt;ref&gt;''Blake, Kierkegaard, and the Spectre of the Dialectic'', Lorraine Clark, Trenton University, Ontario, Cambridge University Press 1991 p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; And Lee Hollander writes of what he perceived as Kierkegaard's problem which could also be every individual's problem. &lt;blockquote&gt;In previous works Kierkegaard had already intimated that what furnished man the impetus to rise into the highest sphere and to assail passionately and incessantly the  barrier of the paradox, or else caused him to lapse into "demonic despair,"&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'', Søren Kierkegaard, Nichol, p. 118ff&lt;/ref&gt; was the consciousness of sin. In the book ''Begrebet Angest'' The Concept of Sin, he now attempts with an infinite and laborious subtlety to explain the nature of sin. Its origin is found in the "sympathetic antipathy"&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard referred to these terms in this book: 
"anxiety is freedom’s actuality as the possibility of possibility. For this reason, anxiety is not found in the beast, precisely because by nature the beast is not qualified as spirit. When we consider the dialectical determinations of anxiety it appears that exactly these have psychological ambiguity. Anxiety is a sympathetic antipathy and an antipathetic sympathy. One easily sees that this is a psychological determination in a sense entirely different form the [[concupiscentia]] of which we speak. Søren Kierkegaard, The Concept of Anxiety p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; of Dread -that force which at one and the same time attracts and repels from the suspected danger of a fall and is present even in the state of innocence, in children. It finally results in a kind of "dizziness" which is fatal. Yet, so Kierkegaard contends, the "fall" of man is, in every single instance, due to a definite act of the will, a "leap" – which seems a patent contradiction. To the modern reader, this is the least palatable of Kierkegaard's works, conceived as it is with a sovereign and almost medieval disregard of the predisposing undeniable factors of environment and heredity (which, to be sure, poorly fit his notion of the absolute responsibility of the individual). Its somberness is redeemed, to a certain degree, by a series of marvelous observations, drawn from history and literature, on the various phases and manifestations of Dread in human life. ''Selections from the writings of Kierkegaard'',  Translated by L. M. Hollander 1923 p. 27-28&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/selectionsfromwr00kieruoft#page/27/mode/1up ''Selections from the writings of Kierkegaard'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robert Harold  Bonthius discusses Kierkegaard's idea of dread in his 1948 book ''Christian Paths to Self-Acceptance'', "Because the original Reformation and the subsequent Protestant scholastic doctrines of man’s depravity are distorted by literal ism, we will turn to those in our day who have revived Reformation thought, the so-called neo-orthodox theologians, for explanation of this profound view of sin and its importance for true self-acceptance. It is important to bear in mind, however, that man’s sinfulness is still conceived of the preached about in the undialectical forms of the past. Especially is this characteristic of flourishing sectarian bodies here in America-groups which are able to number their adherents in tens of thousands. It is Soren Kierkegaard of Denmark who has provided the key to modern reinterpretation of this austere doctrine of sin with his analysis of the relation of sin to anxiety. "Dread or anxiety," he explained "is the psychological condition which precedes sin, comes as near as possible to it, and is as provocative as possible of dread, but without explaining sin, which breaks forth first in the qualitative leap." Kierkegaard saw this "sickness unto death" as the inherent factor in human existence, and he taught that a "synthesis" was needed, by which he meant a vital relationship of man with God by which man may resolve his inner conflicts and live at peace with himself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001391403 ''Christian Paths to Self-Acceptance''  Robert Harold  Bonthius., 1918–   1948 p. 7-8]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt, George Laird interpreted Kierkegaard's writing as basically asking "How can we understand ourselves?" He wrote the following in 1958: &lt;blockquote&gt;What makes man human? Although Kierkegaard does not emphasize the word, he thinks of man in terms of his creatureliness. Man's creatureliness lies in the fact that he stands between life and death. Made in the image of God, he knows what it means to feel the presence of eternity. Feeling the nearness of eternity, utterly dependent upon it for his meaning, he also knows that he dies, and that he cannot escape death. These two factors constitute both his problem and his possibility of for immortality, creates his anguish or his ''nervous humanness''. Man sins in that he is unwilling to live in faith and therefore to be nervously human. He prefers to live either with life or with death but not with both. He seeks to escape creatureliness either by pretending that he will not die or by assuming that there is no eternity. He refuses to bear uncertainty and anguish. Either he turns his back on death by pretending that immortality is automatically a part of all life or he tries to forget his anguish by becoming an animal. It is precisely this anguish, this willingness to live neither as an animal (unaware of eternity) nor as an angel (indifferent to death), which marks the humanness from which we fall when we sin. It is also this greatness. Knowing mortality, even while he hungers humanness, this willingness to risk death as we trust God, which signals the beginning of our redemption.

[[File:Kierkegaard area.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Søren Kierkegaard, the flag of Denmark and the thinker]] [[Mortimer J. Adler]], Director, Institute for Philosophical Research, answered a newspaper question about existentialism asked in 1965: He was asked, "Dear Dr. Adler: What exactly is existentialism? Can a person be a Christian and, at the same time, be an existentialist?"  &lt;blockquote&gt;[[File:Jean-Paul Sartre FP.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Jean-Paul Sartre]]"There are two kinds of existentialist," Jean-Paul Sartre declared in 1947–"the Christian and the atheistic existentialist." Existentialism means, Sartre explained, that "first of all, man exists, turns up, appears on the scene; and then, only afterwards, man defines himself". (...)  Rational thought was no help; in fact, rational explanations are presumptuous and ridiculous, according to Kierkegaard, because no man can have his identity or duty shown to him by reason. The only way for an individual to discover himself is to investigate his own unique existence-his own stresses, desires, tensions. Only through such an inquiry can an individual grasp any truth-insofar as truth is available to the individual. A true Christian, Kierkegaard continues, must recognize that he exists in a mysterious, irrational world, where he must choose with no possibility of knowing whether the outcome will be his salvation or damnation. This "existential" choice, he explains, involves a "leap of faith". (...) Although atheistic existentialists reject Kierkegaard’s belief in God, they tend to accept his idea of the unique, solitary individual who can discover himself only through personal choices and actions. "The existentialist thinks it extremely distressing that God does not exist," Sartre declares, "because all possibility of finding values in a heaven of ideas disappears along with Him." Without God or absolute values, men are "condemned to be free," Sartre continues, "Because once a man is thrown into this world, he is responsible for everything he does."&lt;ref&gt;''The Capital Times'', Madison, Wisconsin, Monday, December 20, 1965, page 22: Today’s Question Dear Dr. Adler: What exactly is existentialism? Can a person be a Christian and, at the same time, be an existentialist? Dwight Pryor, Miami, Oklahoma By Dr. Mortimer J. Adler (Director, Institute for Philosophical Research)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] discussed the existentialism of Sartre and Kierkegaard in his 1960 lecture ''Kierkegaard and the Crisis in Religion''. The lecture is in Primary sources below under See also.

Kierkegaard offered an avenue of hope for those who have anxiety and human nervousness near the end of this little book. {{Quotation|Now the anxiety of possibility holds him as its prey until, saved, it must hand him over to faith. In no other place can he find rest, for every other place of rest is mere chatter, although in the eyes of men it is sagacity. Therefore possibility is absolutely educative. In actuality, no man ever became so unhappy that he did not retain a little remnant, and common sense says correctly that if one is cunning, one knows how to make the best of things. But whoever took possibility’s course in misfortune lost all, all, as no one in actuality ever lost it. Now, if he did not defraud the possibility that wanted to teach him and did not wheedle the anxiety that wanted to save him, then he would also receive everything back, as no one in actuality ever did, even though he also he received all things tenfold, for the disciple of possibility received infinity, and the soul of the other expired in the finite. In actuality, no one ever sank so deep that he could not sink deeper, and there may be one or many who sank deeper. But he who sank in possibility-his eye became dizzy, his eye became confused, so he could not grasp the measuring stick that Tom, Dick, and Harry hold out as a saving straw to one sinking; his ear was closed so he could not hear what the market price of men was in his own day, did not hear that he was just as good as the majority. He sank absolutely, but then in turn he emerged from the depth of the abyss lighter than all the troublesome and terrible things in life. However, I will not deny that whoever is educated by possibility is exposed to danger, not that of getting into bad company and going astray in various ways as are those educated by the finite, but in danger of a fall, namely, suicide. If at the beginning of education he misunderstands the anxiety, so that it does not lead him to faith but away from faith, then he is lost. On the other hand, whoever is educated [by possibility] remains with anxiety; he does not permit himself to be deceived by its countless falsifications and accurately remembers the past. Then the assaults of anxiety, even though they be terrifying, will not be such that he flees from them. For him, anxiety becomes a serving spirit that against its will leads him where he wishes to go. Søren Kierkegaard, ''The Concept of Anxiety'', Nichol p. 158-159}}

"'''The Nature of Mind'''" is a philosophical essay by [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], originally published in ''The Nature of Mind and Other Essays'' in 1980.&lt;ref name=ess&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9629061?q=0801413532&amp;c=book# "The nature of mind and other essays / D.M. Armstrong"] on [[National_Library_of_Australia#Trove|Trove]]. Retrieved 30 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, Armstrong outlines a philosophical account of the [[mind]] that is compatible with the [[Materialism|Materialist]] scientific view of the mind. He arrives at a theory of Central-State Materialism, a [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] between [[René Descartes|Descartes']] [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] (the thesis) and [[Gilbert Ryle|Gilbert Ryle's]] dispositional behaviourism (the antithesis).

== Structure and arguments ==
The essay begins with the simple assertion that "men have minds",&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1980|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Armstrong suggests that modern science may be the best tool with which to investigate the nature of the mind. He says that it seems that scientific consensus is converging on an explanation of the mind in "purely physico-chemical terms".&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 1"/&gt; He acknowledges some disagreement on the matter, but says that dissent tends to be on primarily non-scientific grounds. Armstrong writes that the purpose of his essay is to outline a Materialist account of the nature of the mind - one that is compatible with the scientific view of an entirely physico-chemical mind.

=== The Authority of Science ===
Armstrong states that [[science]] can achieve consensus among experts on controversial matters after prolonged investigation. This, he says, makes science the authority on the nature of the mind and other matters. It is recognized that science can make mistakes, and that some claim that science has a limited sphere of inquiry. He puts forward science as the best hope we have in understanding the mind.

=== Defining the Mental ===
Returning to the search for a Materialist account of the mind, Armstrong considers [[Behaviourism]], which holds that the mind "is not something behind the behaviour of the body, it [is] simply part of that physical behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1980|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Behaviourism fits nicely with a Materialist view of the mind, it has significant flaws - it is possible to feel or think something without acting on this feeling or thought. For instance, one can feel [[anger|angry]] but not express anger. 

Armstrong looks at [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s refinement of Behaviourism, Dispositional Behaviourism. Armstrong illustrates Ryle's idea with a description of [[glass]] - brittleness is the disposition of materials such as glass to shatter under certain circumstances. Whether or not the glass shatters in a particular instance, it has the disposition to do so. In the same way, a mind can have a disposition towards anger, but it may only express this anger under certain circumstances. Armstrong quotes Ryle's ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'': {{Quotation | "To possess a dispositional property is not to be in a particular state, or to undergo a particular change, it is to be bound or liable to be in a particular state, or to undergo a particular change, when a particular change is realized."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ryle|1949|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; | Gilbert Ryle| The Concept of Mind'', 1949'}}
While this dispositionalism quite successfully deals with the objection that one can feel or think one thing and do another, it is not enough - "it seems obvious as anything is obvious that there is something actually going on in me that constitutes my thought".&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1980|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryle's Dispositional Behaviourism denies this, and so Armstrong declares it to be "unsatisfactory as a theory of mind".&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 7"/&gt; Though he rejects Behaviourism, Armstrong suggests that it is useful to say that the mind and mental states are "logically tied to behaviour".&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 7"/&gt; He says that "thought is not speech under suitable circumstances, rather it is something within the person that, in suitable circumstances, brings about speech." He thinks this view is compatible with a Materialist view of the mind, though it is also compatible with non-Materialist views, such as [[Descartes]]'.

Armstrong modifies Ryle's Behaviourism by suggesting that the mind's dispositions may be explainable by science in Materialist terms, in the same way that glass's brittleness can be explained in terms of molecular structure. Armstrong offers this view as a true account of the mind. It is more fully developed in ''Belief, Truth and Knowledge'' (1973), ch. 2, sect. 2.

Armstrong brings together two earlier conclusions: that the mind is "that which stands behind and brings about our complex behaviour";&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 10"&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1980|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Behaviourist's dispositions are "states that underlie behaviour and, under certain circumstances, bring about behaviour",&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 10"/&gt; and reaches "a conception of a mental state as a state of the person apt for producing certain ranges of behaviour".

=== The Problem of Consciousness ===
Armstrong now addresses what he calls 'the problem of consciousness': how can the personal experience of consciousness be explained by his Materialist theory of the mind? Armstrong considers times when the brain goes on 'auto-pilot' - during long drives without breaks, one might suddenly 'come to' and realize that while one has stayed on the road, stopped at red lights and operated the clutch, one was completely unaware of doing so. This shows that it is possible for mental processes to take place without conscious experience.

Before considering how this can be the case, Armstrong describes a method by which a psychologist may determine whether an animal can distinguish between two colours by training it to perform a task that requires this perception. The animal's behaviour would indicate its perception of the colours. While a Behaviourist would say that the animal's behaviour ''was'' its perception, Armstrong describes the perception as a state of the animal's mind. It is implied that one could test for consciousness using a similar method.

Further illustrating his idea, Armstrong gives an analogy in which perception is a key to a door, the door being action. The unlocking of the door, and therefore action, is optional, but one cannot open the door without the key. A blind man, for instance, lacks certain keys. As a result, he cannot operate in an environment in the same way that a sighted man can.

Using this conception of perception as a state, Armstrong characterizes consciousness as "perception or awareness of the state of our own mind",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1980|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "a self-scanning system in the central nervous system".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1980|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sees consciousness not as an external construct that interacts with the body and brain, but a self-aware state of the physical brain.

'''''The Wind Will Carry Us''''' ({{lang-fa|باد ما را خواهد برد}}, ''Bād mā rā khāhad bord'') is a [[1999 in film|1999]] [[Cinema of Iran|Iranian]] film by [[Abbas Kiarostami]]. The title is a reference to a poem written by the modern Iranian poet [[Forough Farrokhzad]].

''The Wind Will Carry Us'' opened to widely positive reviews from critics; in 1999, it was nominated for the [[Golden Lion]] of the [[Venice Film Festival]]. It won the Grand Special Jury Prize (Silver Lion), the FIPRESCI Prize, and the CinemAvvenire award at the festival. It received numerous other nominations and awards as well.

==Plot summary==
Behzad, Keyvan, Ali and Jahan, journalists posing as production engineers, arrive in a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] village to document the locals' mourning rituals that anticipate the death of an old woman, but she remains alive. The main engineer is forced to slow down and appreciate the lifestyle of the village.

==Reception==
===Reviews===
''The Wind Will Carry Us'' opened to wide acclaim from critics. Many hailed it as a masterpiece; the film further cemented Kiarostami's position as one of art-house circles' favorite directors of recent years. In a hugely positive review [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] wrote, "This ambiguous comic masterpiece could be Abbas Kiarostami's greatest film to date; it's undoubtedly his richest and most challenging ... You have to become friends with this movie before it opens up, but then its bounty is endless." The ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'''s Sean Axmaker called it "a celebration of the human spirit nothing short of sublime." [[Michael Atkinson (writer)|Michael Atkinson]], after seeing the film in the first days of 2000, said, "[This is] the best film we'll see this year," and stood by his word. [[J. Hoberman]] wrote, "It's part of the movie's formal brilliance that, suddenly, during its final 10 minutes, too much seems to be happening. ''The Wind Will Carry Us'' is a film about nothing and everything—life, death, the quality of light on dusty hills." The film currently holds an 86/100 score on review aggregator [[Metacritic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-wind-will-carry-us |title=''The Wind Will Carry Us'' Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports 96% approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_wind_will_carry_us/ |title=''The Wind Will Carry Us'' (2014) on RT |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
''The Wind Will Carry Us'' was nominated for the prestigious [[Grand Prix (Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics)|Grand Prix]] of the [[Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics]]. After its screening at the 1999 [[Venice Film Festival]], the film remained unreleased in the United States until 2000; ultimately, however, this was to its benefit, since it enjoyed a rediscovery among both the public and mainstream critics in the late 2000s after many critics named it one of the best films of that decade. ''Variety'''s Scott Foundas placed it ahead of Peter Watkins' ''[[La Commune (Paris, 1871)]]'' and [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]'s ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'', writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Screened in festivals in 1999, but not released in the US until the following year, this fin de siècle/millennium fable by the great Iranian auteur seemed to anticipate many of the dramatic changes that would sweep through filmmaking over the decade to come. In it, an engineer (who turns out to be a kind of filmmaker) travels to a remote Kurdish village with the intent of photographing the funeral rites of a dying 100-year-old woman, and the witty, haunting, poetic film that follows is about his—and Kiarostami's own—struggle to complete that mission, to capture something of real life on film without violating its essence. Kiarostami himself has not worked on film since, preferring the more portable and less invasive technology of video. Call it the first true movie of the digital revolution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2009-12-24/news/best-movies-of-the-decade/ Best movies of the decade]. Miami New Times (2009-12-24). Retrieved on 2014-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2012 poll by the [[British Film Institute]], six critics, including Rosenbaum, ranked ''The Wind Will Carry Us'' one of their 10 favorite films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b835b92be |title=Wind Will Carry Us, The (1999) |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomás Maldonado''' (25 April 1922 – 26 November 2018) was an Argentine painter, designer and thinker, considered one of the main theorists of [[design theory]] of the legendary Ulm Model, a design philosophy developed during his tenure (1954–1967) at the [[Ulm School of Design]] (Hochschule für Gestaltung – HfG) in Germany.&lt;ref name=Ulm1&gt;[http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/ ''Ulm School of Design | HfG Ulm Archive'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ulm2&gt;Lindinger, H., (1991), ''Ulm Design: The Morality of Objects'', Cambridge: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born in the Argentine city of Buenos Aires, Maldonado's artistic formation took place at ''[[:es:Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes Prilidiano Pueyrredón|Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes Prilidiano Pueyrredón]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iuna.edu.ar/institucional/pueyrredon.htm Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes Prilidiano Pueyrredón] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816211003/http://www.iuna.edu.ar/institucional/pueyrredon.htm |date=16 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== The early years ===
In this early period he was involved with the Argentine [[Avant Garde]]s, in fact, he was one of the founders of the painters' movement called ''Arte Concreto-Invención''.

=== The Italian experience ===
Between 1964 and 1967, in collaboration with his German colleague Gui Bonsiepe he created a system of codes for the design program of the Italian firm ''[[Olivetti]]'' and the department store ''[[La Rinascente]]''.  In 1967 he established himself in [[Milan]], continuing to teach in the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature of the [[University of Bologna]], working almost entirely now in philosophy and criticism influenced by [[semiotics]].  In one of his last essays, ''"The Heterodox"'', he claims that the role of the intellectual is to awaken or reveal the collective conscience.

'''Tyāga''' ([[Sanskrit]]:  [[wikt:त्याग#Sanskrit|त्याग]]) is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means "sacrifice, giving up in generosity, forsaking, resigning" anything of value,&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0400/mw__0489.html Tyaga], Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, page 456&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=tyaga&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "renunciation" depending on the context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kapil N.

==Etymology==
Tyāga means&amp;nbsp;– sacrifice, renunciation, abandonment, resignation, donation, forsaking, liberality, withdrawal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=tyAga&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes&amp;choice=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyāga which is not merely physical renunciation of the world is different from [[Sannyasa]]; Sannyasa which comes from the root as means&amp;nbsp;– "giving up entirely", Tyāga means&amp;nbsp;– "giving up with generosity what one could probably have kept".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bhagavad Gita: A text and Commentary for Students|author=Jeaneane D.Fowler|publisher=Sussex Academy Press|page=273|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zU4E5ZidVr0C&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==

Tyāga or abandonment refers to giving up of all anxieties for enjoying the fruits of actions; through practice of this kind of ''tyāga'' infusing [[discipline]] in daily activities the momentary anxiety to enjoy fruits of actions is overcome. It is a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] renunciation of selfishness and desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Managerial Ethics: Dilemmas in Decision Making|author=Poonam Sharma|publisher=SAGE|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsWIy-T-0B4C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yajna is Tyāga ''. The [[Vedic]] interpretation of renunciation (''tyāga '') of the fruits of ritual acts including&amp;nbsp;– ''agnistomena svargakāmo yajeta''&amp;nbsp;– "the desire for heaven", which renunciation is to be found expressed in the phrase&amp;nbsp;– ''agnaye idam na mama''&amp;nbsp;– "this is for Agni, not for me"&amp;nbsp;– pronounced by the yajamana at the time of the oblation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rituals and Mantras: Rules without meanings|author=Frits Staal|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=121|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CKLxjjXqAsQC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=tyaga+rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DqkBU47VEtGI7Ab7soCYAw&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga%20rig%20veda&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tejobindu Upanishad]] belonging to Krishna- yajurveda explains that in  ''Tyāga'' ('renunciation') one abandons the manifestations or objects of the universe through the cognition of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] that is  ''Sat'' and  ''Cit'' and this is practiced by the wise as the giver of immediate salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thirty Minor Upanishads|author=IslamKatob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=79|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CvXZ0j1UyAAC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=tyaga+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A7ABU-3yH4aO7Aa51YDQAg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Kaivalya Upanishad portrays the state of man on the way of renunciation (''tyāga'') as having become free of all attachment to the worldly and who, consequently knows and feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sixty Upanishads of the Veda|author=Paul Deussen|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=791|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XYepeIGUY0gC&amp;pg=PA975&amp;dq=tyaga+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=drUBU7SdK4TChAeiuoGoBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tyaga of Bhagavad Gita===

[[Moksha]] consists in securing lasting freedom from the bondage of existence in the form of birth and death and realizing God who is no other than Bliss (Brahman). Chapter VIII of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] deals with [[Sannyasa]] and Tyāga, the Paths of Knowledge and Action that are means to the attainment of moksha. [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]] that even though ''sannyāsa'' is understood as the giving up of all actions motivated by desires, and ''tyāga'' consists in relinquishing the fruit of all actions; that all actions are worth giving up because they contain a measure of evil that acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not worth shunning, there are three kinds of ''Tyāga''&amp;nbsp;– ''Sattvika'', ''Rajasika'' and ''Tamasika'' (Sloka XVIII.4). Whereas acts of sacrifice, charity and penance, the purifiers of wise men, must be performed without attachment and hope of award, Krishna states - मोहात्तस्य परित्यागस्तामसः (the abandonment of prescribed duty through ignorance) is not advisable, it is the ''Tamasika'' form of  ''tyāga''; if it is owing to कायक्लेशभयात्तयजेत् (abandonment for fear of physical strain) then it is  ''Rajasika'' form; if it is&amp;nbsp;–

:कार्यमित्येव यत्कर्म नियतं क्रियतेऽर्जुन |
:सङंग त्यक्त्वा फलं चैव स त्यागः सात्त्विको मतः| (Sloka XVIII.9)

: "A prescribed duty which is performed simply because it has to be performed, giving up attachment and fruit, that alone has been recognized as the Sattvika form of renunciation. "

Thereafter, Arjuna is told about the marks of a Sattvika-man of renunciation and that since all actions cannot be given up in their entirety by anyone possessing a body, he alone, who abstains from prohibited actions and those that are motivated by desire and performs duties, renounces the fruit of actions is called a man of renunciation; no fruits of actions accrues for him (Sloka XVIII.11-12).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadgita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandaka|publisher=Gita Press, Gorakhpur|pages=659–669|url= http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/srimad-bhagavad-gita-tattvavivecani-english-commentary-IDE961/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preceding discourses, Krishna had recommended to Arjuna actions which ought to be performed as duty (Ch.III.19); He told him to perform ordained actions (Ch.III.8), to be free from attachment (Ch.III.9,19 &amp; Ch.II.48), and to have no desire for the fruit of action (Ch.II.47); Krishna had recommended  ''Sattvika-tyāga''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita: An Exposition|author=Chhaganlal G. Kaji|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwUiusoi0qQC&amp;pg=PA558&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sannyasa and Tyāga===

[[Sannyasa]] literally means&amp;nbsp;– throwing away, absolute rejection, formal monastic life; in the [[Bhagavad Gita]], it means&amp;nbsp;– mental state of thorough-going renunciation, of uncompromising abandonment of all that is unfit and unworthy, of intense dispassion toward things of the world, both internal and external. Tyāga literally means&amp;nbsp;– abandonment, the turning from all that hinders the realization of the Self; in the [[Bhagavad Gita]], it means&amp;nbsp;– renunciation in the sense of relinquishment of the fruit of action. Sannyāsa is external, even though it is based on internal disposition; Tyāga is completely mental, it is a state of thought and attitude. Arjuna is emphatically told that it is possible to act and accrue no karma whatsoever; it is a matter of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita: Commentary Full|author=IslamKotob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=248,250|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b387bE4Ok0oC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f5gBU4WbLuev7QahtoC4CQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, [[Chinmayananda]] remarks that abandonment is the true content of the status of renunciation&amp;nbsp;– ''sannyāsa'' without the  ''tyāga'' spirit is but an empty show; real abandonment is meant for rising to a nobler status of fulfilment, leading on to the ampler fields of expression, to fuller ways of living and to greater experiences of joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Holy Geeta|author=Swami Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=1127,1138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVw_Rff7m7AC&amp;pg=PA1138&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f5gBU4WbLuev7QahtoC4CQ&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, [[Sri Aurobindo|Aurobindo]] explains that&amp;nbsp;– "Sannysa in the standing of the terminology of the sages means the laying aside of desirable actions. In that sense Tyāga, not Sannyasa, is the better way. It is not the desirable actions that must be laid aside, but the desire that gives them that character has to be put away from us... The spiritual transference of all works to the Master and his Shakti is the real sannyāsa in the teachings of the Gita.... The essence of renunciation, the true Tyāga, the true sannyāsa is not any rule of thumb of inaction but a disinterested soul, a selfless mind, the transition from ego to the free impersonal and spiritual nature. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita and its Message|author=Aurobindo|publisher=Lotus Press|pages=252–256|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QnSE5zrNjVUC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=caEBU5KDGqvA7AaTroHoDw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-control|Self-discipline]] too becomes a form of  ''Sattvika-tyāga'', during the course of which exercise one has control over negative emotions and behaviours such as anger, greed and pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita on Effective Leadership|author=Pujan Roka|publisher=iUniverse|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWw-tGKmEYgC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Bhagavad Gita]] projects action to serve as steps on the path of spiritual ascent, as an effective means to purify the mind through diligently cultivated mental discipline in action; the true fruit of Tyāga is an elevating sense of peace and fulfillment, even if it entails a bit of physical discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art of Making Man Part 2|author=Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=339|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSiiLlXehVUC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9KcAU5yVBs-ihgf9woCYDA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==

According to [[Tattvartha Sutra]], an ascetic’s [[dharma]] consists of ten elements i.e. abstract virtues, which are&amp;nbsp;– ''ksama'' ('forebearance'), ''[[mardava]]'' ('humility'), ''arjava'' ('uprightness'), ''sauca'' ('desirelessness'), ''satya'' ('truthfulness'), ''samyama'' ('self-discipline'), ''tapas'' ('self-mortification'), ''tyaga'' ('renunciation'), ''akincanya'' ('poverty') and  ''brahmacharya'' ('celibacy'). [[Hemachandra]] has recognized only two of the ten ''pratyakhyanas'' viz. ''sanketa-pratyakhyana'' and  ''addha-pratyakhyana'', the former, which is of eight types, is symbolic and the devotee refrains from taking food for some time by which renunciation he recalls his mind to his religious duties; the latter, is ritualistic, also connected with abstention from or renouncing food, and has a set methodology to adopt. [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa-vrata]] practiced by the  ''Svetambras'' refers to the renunciation of killing. Basically, there are five kinds of  ''tyāgas'' included in the eleven pratimās viz. ''sacitta-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of renouncing uncooked food; ''ārambha-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of abandonment of all professional activity; ''parigraha-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of transferring publicly one’s property to a son or relative; ''anumati-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of leaving the household and refraining from counselling in household matters, and  ''uddista-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of not eating food especially prepared for oneself i.e. the stage of seeking alms like a monk, commonly followed by  '' [[Śvētāmbara|Svetambras]] '', '' [[Digambara]]s '' and  ''Avasyaka-Curni''. [[Nemicandra]] gives a list of eighty-four asatanas which includes  ''sacittanām atayāga'' or failure to remove sentient objects and  ''ajive tyāga'' or failure to remove non-sentient objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Sarvakacaras|author=R.Williams|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=34,69,173,227|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LLKcrIJ6oscC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yves-Marie Adeline Soret de Boisbrunet''' (born March 24, 1960 in [[Poitiers]], [[France]]) better known as '''Yves-Marie Adeline''', is a French Catholic writer. He also was the founder and leader of the [[France|French]] [[political party]], [[Alliance Royale]].&lt;ref&gt;http://recursed.blogspot.com/2008/05/royalists-in-france.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He is the father of eight.
He taught to the [[University of Poitiers]] from 1986 till 1989, then left the university and alternated periods of writing books and collaboration in political offices. He teaches again today the history of the political ideas in various centers of higher education.

==Philosophy==
His philosophic work concerns three areas of research: in general philosophy, in aesthetics and in politics.
In his book ''Le Carré des philosophes'' (the square of philosophers), he builds a " philosophic square " sides of which are four propositions: Science, Existence, Presence, and Will. The proposition "Existence" is original: Adeline distinguishes the being of the existence itself ; according to him, existence is a dimension of the being. So we can say : the time exists, or a body exists, but a soul does not exist, it "is" only, it is without existing, without existence. The presence in the man of a power recovering from the being but not from the existence shows itself by the Will. Adeline wants it to be the criterion of distinction between the man and quite other creature. Adeline considers the will as typically human, rather than the consciousness, of which he considers that it is a little sure concept in philosophy. 
The will is on the contrary the demonstration of a being in the man, this nonexistent being which shows that a man is not only an object of existence.

Yves - Marie Adeline's aesthetic works update the doctrine of [[Empedocles]] according to whom " only the same knows the same ", but also the aristotelian finalism, according to which the best expert of a saddle is not the craftsman, but the rider. In his book "La Musique et le monde" (music and world),he fights against the official doctrine of the so-called "contemporary music", asserting that this music has been conceived on an exclusively theoretical vision. In "L'Appel des sirènes" (the appeal of sirens), Adeline develops his thought and widens it to the plastic arts.

In "Le Pouvoir légitime" (the justifiable power), preferring good institutions to good leaders, he recommends " an abdication of each of us for the benefit of a common and wholesome principle ", and concludes that a modern monarchy is the best regime. Opponent of the maurrassism, or any other nationalism, he prefers Bonald, and advances the mixed regime (monarchy - aristocracy - democracy).

Yves-Marie Adeline is also a poet : ''L'Epouse'' (the wife); ''Le Manteau d'étoiles'' (the coat of stars); ''Radieuse hostie'' (radiant host) ; ''Les Angéliques ''(angelica).

He has been the president of Alliance Royale, the French royalist party. Candidate with the European elections in 2004, then candidate with presidential election in 2007, he did not obtain the 500 votes of the mayors. With the municipal elections of March 2008 in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, he got 0.96%. He has since resigned the political militancy.
