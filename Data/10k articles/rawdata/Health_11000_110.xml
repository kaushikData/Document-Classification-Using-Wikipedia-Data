[[File:Best Bones Forever.gif|thumb|right|The campaign’s symbol is the “eskullmation point.”]]

''Best Bones Forever!'' is a national bone health campaign that encourages girls ages 9–14 to adopt healthy habits for bone growth and [[osteoporosis]] prevention. The campaign was created by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]’ Office on Women’s Health (OWH) in 2009. The campaign uses popular language, bright colors and images, and energetic messages to express a focus on fun and friendship. ''Best Bones Forever!'' aims to improve girls’ bone health behaviors, which include eating foods with [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] and participating in regular [[physical activity]].

In 2014, OWH concluded its work on the Best Bones Forever! campaign and transferred leadership to American Bone Health, a nonprofit organization that had been a longtime partner of the campaign.

==Bone Health==
By the end of high school, girls develop up to 90% of their [[bone mass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Bone_Health/Juvenile/default.asp “Kids and Their Bones: A Parent’s Guide.”] Retrieved August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is critical that girls ages 9 to 18 build strong, healthy bones that will remain strong for life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Bone_Health/Juvenile/default.asp “Kids and Their Bones: A Parent’s Guide.”] Retrieved August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Foods high in [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] and 60 minutes of daily bone-strengthening activity will help lower girls’ risk of developing [[Bone fractures|fractures]] or [[osteoporosis]] later in life.

=== Bone Healthy Foods ===
* '''Calcium:''' Girls ages 9 to 18 need 1,300 [[Milligrams|milligrams (mg)]] of calcium every day. One serving of low-fat or fat-free milk (1 cup) has about 300&amp;nbsp;mg. Other foods with calcium include calcium-[[Food fortification|fortified]] orange juice (500&amp;nbsp;mg), low-fat or fat-free yogurt (up to 450&amp;nbsp;mg), cheese, fortified cereals, broccoli, and almonds.
* '''Vitamin D:''' In addition to calcium, adolescents need 600 [[International units|international units (IU)]] of vitamin D a day. The body needs vitamin D in order to absorb calcium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Bone_Health/Nutrition/ “Calcium and Vitamin D: Important at Every Age.”] Retrieved August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Check labels:'''  Reading the [[Food label|Nutrition Facts Panel]] (otherwise known as the food label) on a package can reveal how healthy or unhealthy a food item is.
* '''Adding Up the Calcium:''' Nutrition Facts labels don't show how many milligrams of calcium are in a food item. Instead, they show the amount of calcium in a food as a percentage of the Daily Value (written as %Daily Value or %DV). To figure out milligrams on a food label, look at % Daily Value for calcium, and then add 0 to the end of that number. For example, girls need 130% DV for calcium every day. 130% Daily Value is the same amount as 1,300 milligrams of calcium. Note: This calculation works only for calcium, not for other nutrients on the food label.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestbonesforever.gov/best_foods/food_labels.cfm “Foolin' Around with Food Labels.”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818073222/http://bestbonesforever.gov/best_foods/food_labels.cfm |date=August 18, 2011 }} Retrieved August 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Calcium Calculator:''' The ''Best Bones Forever!'' website offers a calcium calculator to help girls understand and increase their daily calcium intake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestbonesforever.gov/best_foods/calculator.cfm “Calcium Calculator.”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819210447/http://bestbonesforever.gov/best_foods/calculator.cfm |date=August 19, 2011 }} Retrieved August 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical Activity ===
Girls between the ages of 9 and 18 need 60 minutes of [[physical activity]] a day, including bone-strengthening activities at least three times a week such as running, jumping, hiking, playing soccer, and dancing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestbonesforever.gov/physical_activity/index.cfm “How Much Physical Activity Do You Need?”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818072320/http://bestbonesforever.gov/physical_activity/index.cfm |date=August 18, 2011 }} Retrieved August 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Activity levels decrease as girls enter their teenage years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girlshealth.gov/parents/bones/activity/index.cfm “Powerful Girls Need Physical Activity.”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819001608/http://www.girlshealth.gov/parents/bones/activity/index.cfm |date=August 19, 2011 }} Retrieved August 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraging girls to adopt physical activity as a lifelong habit or lifestyle may help them remain active throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girlshealth.gov/parents/bones/activity/index.cfm “Powerful Girls Need Physical Activity.”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819001608/http://www.girlshealth.gov/parents/bones/activity/index.cfm |date=August 19, 2011 }} Retrieved August 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign Highlights==
* '''The Let’s Dance Contest:''' In 2011, to encourage girls to get active, ''Best Bones Forever!'' teamed up with teen recording pop group Savvy to launch a national dance contest for girls between the ages of 9 and 18. To enter, girls were required to choreograph a 70 second dance to one of Savvy’s songs and upload it to the contest website. Submissions were judged based on creativity, how well they represented ''Best Bones Forever!'', how well they moved all the bones in their bodies, and for how well they worked as a team. Weekly prizes were awarded, and the grand prize was a trip to Los Angeles to appear in a Savvy music video.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bbfletsdance.com “Best Bones Forever! Let's Dance Contest”]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812052758/http://bbfletsdance.com/ |date=August 12, 2011  }} Retrieved August 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Best Bones Forever dance on the White House Lawn.jpg|thumb|260px|Best Bones Forever! leads a group in learning the BBF dance.]]
* '''''Best Bones Forever!'' went to the White House:''' In 2011, the ''Best Bones Forever!'' team taught [[Michelle Obama|First Lady Michelle Obama]] how to do “the BBF,” a dance choreographed by ''Best Bones Forever!''. Representatives from Hager Sharp and OWH led a dance demonstration on the South Lawn of the [[White House]]. The [[President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition|President’s Council on Fitness, Sports &amp; Nutrition]] event was hosted by the First Lady to announce three new [[Let's Move!|Let’s Move!]] initiatives to promote physical fitness among military families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestbonesforever.gov/WhiteHouseEvent “Best Bones Forever! At the White House! 2011”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327063057/http://www.bestbonesforever.gov/WhiteHouseEvent |date=March 27, 2012 }} Retrieved August 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Best Bones Forever!'' led the First Lady, Olympic Gymnast [[Dominique Dawes]], fitness expert Donna Richardson Joyner, and event participants in a line dance that got their heart rates up and their bones moving. Event participants went home with free bone-health materials that included campaign journals, magnets, and playing cards.
* '''Atlanta Dance Contest &amp; Weekend Jam:''' The ''Best Bones Forever!'' Weekend Jam was a weekend-long event for girls in 2010 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The event began with a dance competition featuring finalists from the ''Best Bones Forever!'' Atlanta Dance Contest, performances by Atlanta-based hip hop group Swagger Crew, and appearances from members of the Atlanta Dream Shooting Stars and Olympic gold medalist [[Allyson Felix]]. The winning team was dubbed Best Dancers Ever! and went home with prizes such as Wiis and Just Dance 2 games.

==Partners==

'''Biomass partitioning''' is the process by which [[plant]]s divide their energy amongst their [[Plant anatomy|parts]]. For example, there may be a tradeoff in proteins and carbohydrates allocated towards leaves for [[photosynthesis]] or to roots for the process of nutrient uptake.The study of [[biomass]] partitioning is important to [[crop]] [[plant growth|growth]]. The percentages of partitioning can be determined with the equation &lt;math&gt; (dW/dt)_i = P_{ci} * dW/dt &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apesimulator.org/help/models/crop/biomasspartitioning.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605095033/http://www.apesimulator.org/help/models/crop/biomasspartitioning.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=June 5, 2016 | title=Biomass partitioning | publisher=Ape Simulator | accessdate=July 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
with ''dW/dt'' is the [[exponential growth|growth rate]] ''(dW/dt)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''P&lt;sub&gt;ci&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the rates of biomass partitioned and the respective partitioning factor for each [[plant organ]] ''i''.

Overall, [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen availability]] has a strong effect on partitioning, with plants growing in low-nitrogen areas partitioning most of their biomass to underground structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cambui CA |author2=Svennerstam H |author3=Gruffman L |author4=Nordin A |author5=Ganeteg U |year=2011|title=Patterns of Plant Biomass Partitioning Depend on Nitrogen Source|journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6|issue=4|pages=e19211|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0019211|display-authors=etal |pmid=21544211 |pmc=3081341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil nitrogen availability is a strong determinant of biomass allocation. For example, in low productivity systems such as [[Taiga|boreal forests]], trees devote a large portion of their biomass to roots. But as the soil productivity begins to increase, biomass is primarily allocated to aboveground structures such as leaves and stems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As an overall pattern, the overall lengths of roots begin to decrease as nitrogen concentrations increase.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Fuzhong|last2=Bao|first2=Weikai|last3=Li|first3=Fanglan|last4=Wu|first4=Ning|date=2008-05-01|title=Effects of drought stress and N supply on the growth, biomass partitioning and water-use efficiency of Sophora davidii seedlings|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098847207002237|journal=Environmental and Experimental Botany|volume=63|issue=1–3|pages=248–255|doi=10.1016/j.envexpbot.2007.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to nitrogen as a factor of plant biomass partitioning, other environmental stressors such as water availability play a role. For example, plants that are growing in dry conditions often have a decreased total biomass production but they also contribute more of their biomass to the roots and develop a higher root:shoot.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When plants allocate more of their biomass to their roots, they are able to enhance water absorption by tapping further down into the [[water table]] as well as extending further laterally with the aid of increased [[Root hair|root hairs.]] But, when there is an extreme soil drought, there is not an increase in root:shoot biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Zhenzhu|last2=Zhou|first2=Guangsheng|last3=Shimizu|first3=Hideyuki|date=2010-06-01|title=Plant responses to drought and rewatering|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.5.6.11398|journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior|volume=5|issue=6|pages=649–654|doi=10.4161/psb.5.6.11398|issn=1559-2324|pmc=3001553|pmid=20404516}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that there is a limit to which plant biomass allocation responds to water stress and possibly other environmental factors as well.  It is important for plants to be able to balance their absorption and utilization processes with differing water and nitrogen availabilities because they adjust their growth in order to accommodate the abundances of growth-limiting resources, such as water and nitrogen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Osteopathic medicine}}
The '''Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination of the United States''' ('''COMLEX-USA''') is a series of three [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic]] medical licensing examinations administered by the [[National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners]] (NBOME) similar to the United States Medical Licensing Examination ([[USMLE]]).  COMLEX-USA is the most common pathway by which [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physicians]] ([[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]s) apply for medical licensure, and is accepted in all 50 states. The 3-digit standard scores of COMLEX-USA Level 1, Level 2- Cognitive Evaluation (CE), and Level 3 have a range of 9-999 and a mean of 500. Most candidates score between 250 and 800. 400 is the minimum passing score for COMLEX-USA Levels 1 and 2; 350 for COMLEX-USA Level 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbome.org/comlex-cbt.asp?m=can#description |title=COMLEX Computer Based Testing (CBT) |author= |year=2010 |work= |publisher=NBOME |accessdate=18 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== COMLEX-USA Level 1 ==
COMLEX-USA Level 1 is typically taken after completion of the second year of [[medical school]].  The exam consists of 400 questions administered in one day and consists of two, four-hour exam sessions separated by a 40-minute break. Each of the four-hour sessions allows a ten-minute break which is no longer subtracted from the time allotted for the respective four-hour sessions since the 2017 NBOME policy change.  Candidates are expected to know the basic mechanisms of health and disease process.  The mean score for the COMLEX-USA Level 1 is approximately 500-540 (for first time test-takers), with a standard deviation of about 85 (although this may vary slightly from year to year). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Match Report Sheds Light on Credentials Needed to Secure Residencies |author=Carolyn Schierhorn |url=http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/?p=82751 |newspaper=[[The DO]] |date=December 21, 2011 |accessdate=June 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607090406/http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/?p=82751# |archive-date=2012-06-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, level one covers basic medical sciences, including:
*[[anatomy]]
*[[behavioral science]]
*[[biochemistry]]
*[[microbiology]]
*[[osteopathic manipulative medicine|osteopathic principles]] 
*[[pathology]]
*[[pharmacology]]
*[[physiology]]

== COMLEX-USA Level 2 ==
COMLEX-USA Level 2, taken during the third or fourth year of [[medical school]], consists of two parts: Level 2-Cognitive Evaluation (CE) and Level 2-Performance Evaluation (PE).  Level 2-CE requires candidates to demonstrate knowledge of clinical concepts and medical decision-making.  The mean score for the COMLEX-USA Level 2 CE is approximately 540 (for first time test-takers), with a standard deviation of about 100 (although this may vary slightly from year to year). The examination is problem-based and symptoms-based, integrating the clinical disciplines of: 
*[[emergency medicine]]
*[[family medicine]]
*[[internal medicine]]
*[[obstetrics]]/[[gynecology]]
*[[osteopathic|osteopathic principles]] 
*[[pediatrics]]
*[[psychiatry]]
*[[surgery]]

Level 2-PE was introduced in 2005.  It is a one-day, seven-hour clinical skills examination and utilizes standardized patients (actors trained to present clinical symptoms) to test clinical skills. The exam is graded either pass or fail unlike the other COMLEX exams.  Testing sites are available in [[Conshohocken, PA]], and in [[Chicago|Chicago, IL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbome.org/who-we-are/our-locations/|title=Testing Sites for the COMLEX-USA Level 2 PE|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nbome.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates must complete 12 standardized patient encounters, each 14 minutes in duration.  Following each encounter, candidates have 9 minutes in order to type a SOAP note.  Candidates are strongly encouraged to make full use of the allotted time for each encounter to ensure thoroughness in both components of an encounter.  Scoring for the COMLEX-USA Level 2 PE is on a pass/fail basis only.  Candidates must demonstrate proficiency in:
*history taking and physical examination skills
*integrated [[differential diagnosis]] and clinical problem solving
*written communication and synthesis of clinical findings ([[SOAP note|SOAP note format]])
*osteopathic principles and/or [[osteopathic manipulative treatment]]

== COMLEX-USA Level 3 ==
The final examination, COMLEX-USA Level 3, is typically taken after starting a residency program and covers the clinical disciplines of medicine, including:
*[[emergency medicine]]
*[[family medicine]]
*[[internal medicine]]
*[[obstetrics]]/[[gynecology]]
*[[osteopathic|osteopathic principles]] 
*[[pediatrics]]
*[[psychiatry]]
*[[surgery]]
Beginning in September 2018, this exam will be a two-day computer-based examination consisting of up to 550 multiple choice questions, and up to 30 additional clinical decision-making cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbome.org/exams-assessments/comlex-usa/comlex-usa-level-3/|title=COMLEX-USA · Level 3  —  NBOME|website=www.nbome.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean score for COMLEX-USA Level 3 is approximately 550 (for first-time test takers), with a standard deviation of about 125.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbome.org/exams-assessments/comlex-usa/comlex-usa-level-3/scores-transcripts/scoring-principles/|title=Scoring Principles  —  NBOME|website=www.nbome.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==USMLE comparison==
Many osteopathic medical students apply to [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]]-accredited residencies with COMLEX scores alone. Based on data from recent results of the COMLEX-USA examination, for level 1 and level 2, a score of 500-540 is considered the 50th percentile with scores falling slightly under and over this mark to be considered similarly. A score of 600 is historically considered to be around the 80th percentile. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbome.org/CBT_Score_Conv/|title=CBT Score Conversion (COMLEX-USA to USMLE)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nbome.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians''' ('''CAEP''') is the [[professional association]] of [[emergency physician]]s in [[Canada]]. It is also known in [[French language|French]] as ''Association Canadienne Des Medecins d'Urgence'' (''ACMU''). The official journal of the CAEP is the [[Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine]].

The CAEP helped found the [[International Federation for Emergency Medicine]] in 1991 along with the [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] (ACEP), the [[Australasian College for Emergency Medicine]] (ACEM), and the (then) [[Royal College of Emergency Medicine|British Association for Emergency Medicine]] (BAEM) .

The '''Centre for Arab Genomic Studies''' (CAGS) is a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] study centre aimed at the characterization and prevention of [[genetic disorder]]s in the [[Arab|Arab World]]. The Centre is closely associated with the [[Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum Award for Medical Sciences|Sheikh Hamdan Award for Medical Sciences]]. One of the major projects of CAGS is the Catalogue for Transmission Genetics in Arabs (CTGA), an online, freely accessible database of genetic disorders reported from the Arab World. CAGS has been involved in the [[Human Variome Project]] as a representative of the Arab region, and has been one of the first organizations to take an active lead in working on the project. CAGS organizes the Pan Arab Human Genetics Conference every alternate year, to provide a platform for discussion and education on genetic issues in the region.

==History==

The Arab World is known for the increased incidence of genetic disorders among the population. A large part of this is attributed to the widespread norm of [[consanguinity]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.38982.704931.AE |pmid=17053236 |pmc=1618440 |title=Genetic disorders in the Arab world |journal=BMJ |volume=333 |issue=7573 |pages=831–834 |year=2006 |last1=Al-Gazali |first1=Lihadh |last2=Hamamy |first2=Hanan |last3=Al-Arrayad |first3=Shaikha }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors include a social trend to have more children until [[menopause]], selective factors favoring inherited disease characters like [[thalassemia]] and [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], and the lack of public awareness towards the early recognition and prevention of inherited disease. CAGS was originally envisaged by Sheikh [[Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], Deputy Ruler of [[Dubai]] and Minister of Finance and Industry, [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], to alleviate human suffering from genetic diseases in the Arab World. The Centre was inaugurated on 25 June 2003 by Hamad Abdul Rahman Al Midfaa, the Minister of Health, and Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Award for Medical Sciences, at the Genetic Centre of Al Wasl Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uaeinteract.com/docs/Arab_genomic_studies_centre_inaugurated_/8497.htm Arab genomic studies centre inaugurated UAE - The Official Web Site - News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014}} offices of the Centre for Arab Genomic Studies were located within the premises of Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Award for Medical Sciences.

Some of the priority objectives of CAGS are to educate the public and professionals on the important impact of genetic diseases in the Arab World and the methods and benefits of early genetic diagnosis. CAGS also plans to provide comprehensive genetic services by translating research achievements into well-integrated patient treatment programs. It also intends to address the ethical, legal, and social issues that may arise with the implementation of such programs. A small number of local scientists from the UAE constitute the Executive Board of CAGS, which helps in taking policy decisions for the Centre.

In late 2005 the Arab Council of CAGS was formed, which comprises leading [[geneticist]]s from different Arab countries. {{As of|2014}} the Council had representations from [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], and [[Tunisia]].  The Council was formed with an aim to facilitate the exchange of information on genetic disorders occurring in Arab countries and to be a medium for multidisciplinary collaborative research aiming at the identification and prevention of genetic disorders in the region.

==Activities and Projects==

===CTGA Database===

The Catalogue for Transmission Genetics in Arabs (CTGA) [[database]] is an enormous project, which aims to create a compendium of information related to the entire range of genetic disorders reported among Arabs. This information is available in a freely accessible form at the CAGS website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cags.org.ae/ctga_search.html Centre for Arab Genomic Studies (CAGS) -&gt; CTGA -&gt; Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As of now, the database has information on about 1160 genetic disorders and related [[gene]]s reported in Arab subjects. CAGS' strategy with regard to the CTGA database is to cover the spectrum of genetic diseases in each of the Arab countries one after the other, ultimately covering the entire Arab World. By December 2008, the database has finished its project with respect to the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Oman, and hopes to complete its coverage of genetic disorders in Qatar within few more months.

===Pan Arab Human Genetics Conference===

The Pan Arab Human Genetics series of Conference is planned to be held every alternate year by the Centre as a means of providing a platform on dialogue and education for geneticists in the region, to share their knowledge and to talk on common issues. The first edition of the conference, held in 2006, was supported by the [[Human Genome Organization]] (HUGO), and attracted more than 500 delegates. This conference was preceded by a one-day workshop on "Fundamental Approaches in Molecular Diagnosis of Hemoglobinopathies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2006/February/theuae_February803.xml&amp;section=theuae&amp;col= Khaleej Times Online - International experts will attend human genetics conference&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Pan Arab Human Genetics Conference, held in November 2007, put more emphasis on the [[ethics]] of genetic research. 
This conference provided a one-day public forum on the Ethical Perspective of Genetic Research; a forum which saw religious 
leaders as well as genetic researchers discussing this very important issue. The scientific part of the congress lasted two 
days, and was attended by well over 800 delegates, many of them from outside the Arab region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710001820/http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/09/09/10152397.html Gulfnews: Dubai sets stage to find solution to genetic disorder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/11/25/10170119.html Gulfnews: 'Get involved in genetic research'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127082442/http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/11/25/10170119.html |date=November 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701134204/http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/11/24/10169933.html Gulfnews: Scientists advise easing restrictions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference was supported by the Dubai Health Authority, the Dubai Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department, the Human Variome Project, and HUGO. Other participating organizations included the Division of Ethics of Science and Technology, [[UNESCO]], the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development, [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]], and the journal, Nature Genetics. Like the previous conference, a two-day pre-conference workshop on the Applications of [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]] technology in Cytogenetyics was also held as part of the program of the conference.

===Human Variome Project===

CAGS was a participant in the preliminary meeting to discuss the conception of the [[Human Variome Project]] (HVP), held in Melbourne, Australia, in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng2024 |pmid=17392799 |title=Recommendations of the 2006 Human Variome Project meeting |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=433–436 |year=2007 |last1=Cotton |first1=Richard G.H |author2=2006 Human Variome Project |last3=Appelbe |first3=W |last4=Auerbach |first4=A.

Several meeting have been held with the members of the Council, as well as the Director of the HVP in order to understand the nature of work involved, and to initiate the project in the region.

===Human Genome Organization===

CAGS shares very close ties with the [[Human Genome Organization]] (HUGO). HUGO served as a prominent supporter of both concluded editions of the PAHG Conference. In addition, CAGS with the help of the [[Dubai World Trade Centre]] and Dubai Convention Bureau, made a successful bid to host the HUGO Annual Human Genome Meet (HGM) 2011 in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?section%3Dtheuae%26xfile%3Ddata%2Ftheuae%2F2008%2Fdecember%2Ftheuae_december323.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608195118/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?section=theuae&amp;xfile=data%2Ftheuae%2F2008%2Fdecember%2Ftheuae_december323.xml |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The Centre published the first two volumes of its book "Genetic Disorders in the Arab World", which is a consequence of its work on cataloguing the Arab genetic disorders. The first volume of this book gives special emphasis on the data from United Arab Emirates, whereas the second volume deals specially with the Kingdom of Bahrain. Another book published by CAGS is a User's Guide on the CTGA database. All books are downloadable without charge from the CAGS website (http://cags.org.ae/publications.html)

As part of its campaign to educate the general public about genetic disorders and their consequences, CAGS released a pocket-book collection of bilingual (English and Arabic) pamphlets on six common genetic blood disorders in the region. Each of these leaflets provides a general description of an inherited blood disorder, along with its symptoms and major characteristics, and follows it up with causes and risk factors, diagnosis and management of the disease. Also provided in each leaflet is information on studies undertaken in the Arab world on the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cags.org.ae/publications.html Centre for Arab Genomic Studies (CAGS) -&gt; Publications&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific articles published by the Centre include articles in the [[Nucleic Acids Research]], [[American Journal of Human Genetics]], and  American Journal of Medical Genetics.

The '''Shahjahan ki baoli''', more commonly known as the '''Choron ki baoli''', is a [[baoli]] in [[Maham]], [[Haryana]], [[India]]. The structure, which was built during the reign of Emperor [[Shah Jahan]], collects and holds rainwater for use by the nearby town of Maham. While no longer in mainstay use, the baoli has been persevered as a tourist attraction.

== History ==
=== Background ===
Due to the infrequent nature of rainstorms in Haryana, water-gathering and holding structures known as [[stepwell]]s or baoli were constructed to capture rainwater for agricultural and domestic use.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Philip (1989). ''The Penguin guide to the monuments of India''. London: Viking. {{ISBN|0-14-008425-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takezawa, Suichi. "Stepwells -Cosmology of Subterranean Architecture as seen in Adalaj" (pdf). ''The Diverse Architectural World of The Indian Sub-Continent''. Retrieved 2009-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The water reserves stored by stepwells like the Choron ki baoli aided in conserving water during long periods of droughts. As such, many similar structures were built in Northwestern India.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/news/har-roh-choron-ki-baoli-in-maham-haryana-4787737-pho.html|title=PIX: यहां दफन है अरबों का खजाना, जो भी गया अंदर नहीं लौटा वापस|work=Dainik Bhaskar|access-date=2018-11-06|language=hi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Choron ki baoli was built in the town of Maham between the years 1658-1659 on the orders of Saidu Kala, a local official.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haryanatourism.gov.in/Destination/shahjahan-ki-baoli|title=Shahjahan ki Baoli {{!}} Places of interest {{!}} Rohtak {{!}} Tourism Hubs {{!}} Haryana Tourism Corporation Limited.|website=haryanatourism.gov.in|language=en-IN|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kala was a member of the [[Rajasthan|Rajastani]] [[Chobdar caste]] and a vassal of Emperor [[Shah Jahan]] of the [[Mughal Empire]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; who was himself a great patron of architecture. The stepwell built in Maham was intended to alleviate some of the effects of the seasonal drought the town suffered through. In addition, some sources state that treasures looted during the Mughal army's wars were intended to be hidden inside the baoli and in the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hindi.nativeplanet.com/travel-guide/choron-ki-baoli-in-rohtak-haryana-india-shahjahan-hindi/articlecontent-pf19475-002728.html|title=रहस्यमयी सुरंगों वाली बावड़ी, जहां छुपा है अरबों का खजाना|work=https://hindi.nativeplanet.com|access-date=2018-11-06|language=hi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Description ===
The structure itself contains three separate chambers in which to hold increasing amounts of water; as rain was collected by the structure, one level at a time would be filled. A total of 101 steps lead down to the lowest point of the reservoir. In addition to holding water, rooms were built within and around the stepwell to house travelers and passersby. The entire project was constructed out of bricks and kankar ([[cement]]) blocks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As of 2018, the structure has decayed, with some of its original carvings and inscriptions being worn away.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the structure continues to collect and hold water, and has become a tourist attraction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Harayana District Factbook; Rohtak District.

=== Value Added Information Medical Products ===
The programme that would develop into the current organisation was initially developed by an Essex [[general practitioner]], Dr [[Alan Dean (GP)|Alan Dean]], to facilitate day-to-day management of his own general practice, in collaboration with IT staff at the BATA shoe factory in East Tilbury near to his practice. Early programmers included a Czech programmer [[Jan Boda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The early development team of three, Marcella Devenish (formerly a midwife), Philip Lee-Warren (formerly a Senior Medical Laboratory Scientific Officer), under the leadership of Kieran O'Mally, developed further the computerised system using the BOS Microcobol development environment. During this period the number of UK practices using the software product IGP (Integrated General Practice) expanded from a few hundred to over two and a half thousand. In return for anonymous Healthcare data, VAMP Ltd offered GPs the cash equivalent of GBP 500 a month in order to build the VAMP research databank for research purposes. As of 1988, the VAMP research databank comprised 57 practices and 543,100 patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Gillian|date=1988|title=Post-Marketing Surveillance Using a Computerised General Practice Data Base|url=|journal=Pharmaceut.

=== General Practice Research Database ===
In November 1993, its parent company was acquired by [[Reuters|Reuters Health Information]], which donated the database to the [[Department of Health (UK)|Department of Health]] in 1994, at which time it became General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and contained data from 650 practices (4.4 million active patients). At this time, there were two licensees of the data: dr Alan Dean, and Professor [[Hershel_Jick|Hershel Jick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Ministry taps into database goldmine|last=Brindle|first=David|date=9 January 1995|work=The Guardian|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the database was operated by the [[Office for National Statistics]] until 1999, at which point the [[Medicines Control Agency]] (MCA) took over. This agency became the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) on 1 April 2003 following a merger with the [[Medical Devices Agency]] (MDA).  Since then, use of the database has expanded within the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and overseas.  The GPRD was run as a sub-division of the MHRA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gprd.com/whygprd/history.asp GPRD: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920065625/http://www.gprd.com/whygprd/history.asp |date=2007-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The research utility of GPRD has been dramatically enhanced by linkage to other datasets on an individual patient level. External datasets included the [[Hospital Episode Statistics]], death certificates, the national cancer registry and MINAP (cardiovascular disease) registry.

=== Launch of the CPRD ===
{{cquote|In March 2011, The Government launched its ‘Plan for Growth’ which details steps needed to enable the British economy to become more internationally competitive.

}}

Following the announcement by the chancellor on the "Plan for Growth", a commissioned study entitled the "Research Capability Programme" was initiated with the aim of assessing the available research capabilities of the UK and future potential growth areas in this sector. An opportunity was identified for the collaboration of the Department of Health and the MHRA in creating a joint research service, based upon consolidating and expanding existing independent services. The new service, known as the CPRD has been developed to meet the expectations and criteria outlined by the "Plan for Growth".

On 29 March 2012, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the Department of Health's [[National Institute for Health Research]] (NIHR) launched the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).&lt;ref name="pressrelease201203"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pressreleases/CON146890|title=Clinical Practice Research Datalink launches to improve health research|publisher=Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|work=Press Release|date=29 March 2012|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the launch of CPRD, [[Kent Woods|Sir Kent Woods]], Chief Executive of the MHRA said, "The Clinical Practice Research Datalink will provide new data and research services that will improve the health of patients and also make the UK a world leader in life sciences research."&lt;ref name="pressrelease201203" /&gt;  [[David Willetts]], Minister for Universities and Science, said, "The UK is a world leader in life sciences, but both the research base and industry tell us that we could make better use of data in order to drive medical breakthroughs. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink will provide researchers with access to safeguarded data that respects patient confidentiality. This will give valuable insights into serious health conditions and ultimately help reduce the time it takes to develop new treatments."&lt;ref name="pressrelease201203" /&gt; The GPRD became part of the data services provision from CPRD.

At its launch in April 2012, CPRD was established as the new, England-wide NHS observational and interventional research service. It has built on the research developments of the GPRD, and also the Health Research Support Service (HRSS) previously managed by the NIHR Research Capability Program.

*The GPRD was a large primary care database, containing anonymised primary care data and links to a number of NHS and other data sources. The GPRD specialised in providing anonymised data  and research service capabilities to a variety of medical and public health studies. 
*The HRSS was a pilot service to demonstrate the feasibility of research using a range of health-care information. The HRSS used its analyses and expertise linking large sets of anonymised data for research studies.

CPRD remains housed within the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and is now one of the three 'centres' within the Agency.

==Work of the CPRD==
The CPRD builds on its predecessors' capabilities and aims to provide a range of services and products in the areas of medical research and public health care. Fundamental to the work of the CPRD is the collection and linkage of anonymised data sets and provision of research services.

===Data===
The CPRD utilises the maximum benefit of linked data sets and the UK’s health system to provide researchers with access to high quality anonymous primary and secondary health care data. The data collected allows researchers access to a wealth of information including;

* Prescribed primary care drugs
* Laboratory data
* Consultations
* GP and hospital coded disease data
* Disease Registers
* Cancer Registers

The NHS provides, free at the point of delivery, healthcare to a population of 52 Million in England. With access to the data sets of NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland the CPRD can provide a population of potentially up to 64 Million patients in the UK. Further access and partnerships have been established to include data sets from other European countries. The linking of anonomysed primary care data with large data registries and related data sets means the CPRD can offer a huge array of data and information for the inclusion in medical research studies. This will include areas such as; prescription drugs uses and effect, long term patient treatment strategy, long term health benefit studies, epidemic and pandemic studies and demographic health and welfare studies.

For example, an analysis of 100 million GP consultations using CPRD data in 2016 provided the first substantial evidence of the increase in GP clinical workload in England&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=F D Richard|last2=Bankhead|first2=Clare|last3=Mukhtar|first3=Toqir|last4=Stevens|first4=Sarah|last5=Perera-Salazar|first5=Rafael|last6=Holt|first6=Tim|last7=Salisbury|first7=Chris|title=Clinical workload in UK primary care: a retrospective analysis of 100 million consultations in England, 2007–14|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673616006206|journal=The Lancet|volume=387|issue=10035|pages=2323–2330|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(16)00620-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Research Services===
The CPRD has a range of research experience and expertise including:

* [[Pharmacoepidemiology]]
* Pharmacoeconomics
* Research Guidance
* Protocol Development
* Research methodology
* Outcomes 
* Risk benefit.
* Data verification services

The CPRD provides consulting services for a range of research activities. Provided by an experienced internal team, the research service offers advice on research methodology and research governance as well as a host of other services. Drawing from its expertise and predecessors' experience the CPRD research team has built a reputation for conducting high-end research projects, from protocol development, gaining approvals for research, data analysis and report and publication writing. The research capacity is such that the CPRD has the resource and expertise to undertake research projects on behalf of customers or independently, for a variety of undertakings from the commercial regulatory, charitable and academic sectors. A huge range of studies from the CPRD and predecessors have been published and a list of published papers can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20120627231813/http://www.cprd.com/Bibliography/Researchpapers.asp CPRD Research]

===Interventional Research Services===
The CPRD offers a range of interventional research services to facilitate the running of clinical trials. 

* The assessment of the feasibility of research proposals. 
* Data supply and verification services. 
* Randomisation into the study at the point of care.
* Clinical trial management support.
* Long term follow up through routine data collection, minimising the problem of 'lost to follow up'.
* A framework for conducting pharmacogenetic studies.

==Information collected by the CPRD==

The primary health care data collected by the CPRD is taken from participating [[General practitioner#United Kingdom|GP surgeries]] in the [[United Kingdom]].  Personal identifiers are not collected, protecting the privacy of the individuals from whom the data comes. Data collected includes;

* Demographics (including age and sex)
* Medical symptoms, signs and diagnoses
* Therapy (medicines, vaccines, devices)
* Treatment outcomes
* Events leading to withdrawal of a drug or treatment
* Referrals to hospitals or specialists
* Laboratory tests, pathology results
* Lifestyle factors (height, weight, BMI, smoking and alcohol consumption)
* Socioeconomic status
* Patient registration, practice and consultation details

There is a history of [[clinical research]] done on [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, especially [[glucosamine]] and [[chondroitin]], for the treatment of [[arthritis]]. Since [[glucosamine]] is a precursor for [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, and glycosaminoglycans are major components of [[cartilage]], ingesting glucosamine might nourish joints, and thereby alleviate [[arthritis]] symptoms.

Some of the evidence for the effectiveness of glucosamine is disputed.&lt;ref name="bestbets.org"&gt;[http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=979 The effects of Glucosamine Sulphate on OA of the knee joint]. BestBets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22925619"/&gt; A 2008–2009 review of all known studies of glucosamine supplements for horses, for example, found that almost all studies had failed to meet usual standards and were fatally compromised by basic errors in their execution, including failure to test whether active ingredients were as stated, lack of adequate (or any) [[control group]]s or baseline measurements, very small sample sizes, and ignoring prior research or self-evident omissions.&lt;ref name=pubmed1/&gt;&lt;ref name=proceedings1 /&gt;  The authors highlighted [[confirmation bias]] as a significant issue in such studies, in that most studies were undertaken by manufacturers, on products they already produced commercially, and they were usually undertaken to support claims of benefits which could be used to market the product.&lt;ref name=pubmed1/&gt;&lt;ref name=proceedings1 /&gt; More recently,  other reviews found little evidence that glucosamine and chondroitin supplements were any better than a [[placebo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wandel S, Jüni P, Tendal B, Nüesch E, Villiger PM, Welton NJ, Reichenbach S, Trelle S | title = Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis | journal= BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume=341 | pages=c4675 | date = Sep 16, 2010 | pmid=20847017 | pmc=2941572 | doi=10.1136/bmj.c4675 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wu D, Huang Y, Gu Y, Fan W | title = Efficacies of different preparations of glucosamine for the treatment of osteoarthritis: a meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. | journal = International Journal of Clinical Practice | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 585–94 | date = Jun 2013 | pmid = 23679910 | doi = 10.1111/ijcp.12115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or at most only slightly better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Analgesics for Osteoarthritis: An Update of the 2006 Comparative Effectiveness Review [Internet]. | date = Oct 2011 | pmid = 22091473 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US) | vauthors=Chou R, McDonagh MS, Nakamoto E, Griffin J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21220090"/&gt;

==History of trials==
In general, the clinical trials of the mid-1990s that furnished positive results showing glucosamine efficacy were later deemed to be of poor quality due to shortcomings in their methods, including small size, short duration, poor [[Intention to treat analysis|analysis of drop-outs]], and unclear procedures for [[double-blind|blinding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adams ME | title = Hype about glucosamine | journal = [[The Lancet|Lancet]] | volume = 354 | issue = 9176 | pages = 353–4 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10437858 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(99)90040-5 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McAlindon TE, LaValley MP, Gulin JP, Felson DT | title = Glucosamine and chondroitin for treatment of osteoarthritis: a systematic quality assessment and meta-analysis | journal = [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] | volume = 283 | issue = 11 | pages = 1469–75 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10732937 | doi = 10.1001/jama.283.11.1469 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, several independent studies did not detect any benefit of glucosamine supplementation on osteoarthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hughes R, Carr A | title = A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of glucosamine sulphate as an analgesic in osteoarthritis of the knee | journal = [[Rheumatology (Oxford, England)]] | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–84 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11934964 | doi = 10.1093/rheumatology/41.3.279 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cibere J, Kopec JA, Thorne A, Singer J, Canvin J, Robinson DB, Pope J, Hong P, Grant E, Esdaile JM | title = Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled glucosamine discontinuation trial in knee osteoarthritis | journal = [[Arthritis and Rheumatism]] | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 738–45 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15478160 | doi = 10.1002/art.20697  |name-list-format=vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] 2005 [[meta-analysis]] of glucosamine therapy for osteoarthritis found that only the Rotta brand of glucosamine appeared to be superior to placebo in the treatment of pain and functional impairment resulting from symptomatic osteoarthritis.&lt;ref name="pmid15846645"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Towheed|first1=TE|last2=Maxwell|first2=L|last3=Anastassiades|first3=TP|last4=Shea|first4=B|last5=Houpt|first5=J|last6=Robinson|first6=V|last7=Hochberg|first7=MC|last8=Wells|first8=G|title=Glucosamine therapy for treating osteoarthritis.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=18 April 2005|issue=2|pages=CD002946|pmid=15846645|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002946.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the low quality and older studies were discounted and only those using the highest-quality design were considered, there was no difference from [[placebo]] treatment.&lt;ref name=AFP2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dahmer S, Schiller RM | title = Glucosamine | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 78 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–6 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18756654 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/20080815/471.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second 2005 review of glucosamine clinical trials reached a different conclusion. Published in the ''Annals of Pharmacotherapy'', the authors of this review concluded that "The available evidence suggests that glucosamine sulfate may be effective and safe in delaying the progression and improving the symptoms of knee OA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Poolsup N, Suthisisang C, Channark P, Kittikulsuth W | title = Glucosamine long-term treatment and the progression of knee osteoarthritis: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials | journal = Annals of Pharmacotherapy | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 1080–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15855241 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1E576 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic review in 2007 found that effect sizes from glucosamine supplementation were highest in industry-funded studies and lowest in independent studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vlad SC, LaValley MP, McAlindon TE, Felson DT | title = Glucosamine for pain in osteoarthritis; why do trial results differ? | journal = Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism | volume = 56 | issue = 7 | pages = 2267–77 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17599746 | doi = 10.1002/art.22728 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may lead one to believe that bias is responsible for the heterogeneity of the clinical study findings regarding the efficacy of glucosamine. An alternative explanation may be that the two commonly available forms, sulfate and hydrochloride, while used interchangeably by the general public and even the medical community, appear to have different pharmacologic effects ''in vivo''. Another 2007 review of the available research concluded that there was "compelling evidence" that glucosamine sulfate (but not hydrochloride) slowed the progression of knee and hip osteoarthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bruyere O, Reginster JY | title = Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate as therapeutic agents for knee and hip osteoarthritis | journal = Drugs &amp; Aging | volume = 24 | issue = 7 | pages = 573–80 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17658908 | doi = 10.2165/00002512-200724070-00005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding was confirmed by a 2013 meta-analysis of 19 glucosamine trials which concluded that while neither form of glucosamine appeared significantly more effective than placebo at symptom improvement, glucosamine sulfate alone showed efficacy in improving physical function in knee OA as measured by the Lequesne Index in trials lasting more than 24 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wu D, Huang Y, Gu Y, Fan W | title = Efficacies of different preparations of glucosamine for the treatment of osteoarthritis: A meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials | journal = International Journal of Clinical Practice | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 585–94 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23679910 | doi = 10.1111/ijcp.12115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[U.S. National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) funded a 24-week, 12.5 million-dollar [[multicenter trial|multicenter clinical trial]] (the GAIT trial) to study the effect of [[chondroitin sulfate]], glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin/glucosamine in combination, and [[celecoxib]] as a treatment for knee-pain in two groups of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: Patients with ''mild pain'' (n=1229), and patients with ''moderate to severe pain'' (n=354).&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00032890|Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT)}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the data from both groups were pooled and analyzed, there was no [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] difference between groups taking glucosamine HCl, chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine/chondroitin; and those taking an inactive placebo or the positive control, the prescription analgesic celecoxib. The authors of the study analyzed the moderate-to-severe pain group and found that in this group, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin was more effective at providing pain relief than the positive control with 79% of the glucosamine group reporting at least a 20% reduction in pain compared to 70% for celecoxib and only 54% reporting a similar reduction in the placebo group.  However, the researchers caution that given the small size of the sub-group, these findings should be confirmed with further studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The NIH Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT) | journal = Journal of Pain and Palliative Care Pharmacotherapy 	 | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–43 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19062354 | doi=10.1080/15360280801989351| author1 = National Center for Complimentary Alternative Medicine 	 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its size and design, the GAIT trial may have also had some important limitations, however. When considering the entire cohort, none of the treatments studied performed significantly better (or worse) than placebo in improving patient WOMAC pain and function scores. In other words, because of the inclusion of both a placebo and a positive control, and the fact that roughly 60% of each treatment group achieved the same level of improvement, it is difficult to conclude anything about the efficacy or non-efficacy of glucosamine in the treatment of knee OA from this study.&lt;ref name="pmid20525840"/&gt;

In a follow-up study in 2008, 572 patients from the GAIT trial continued their supplementation for 2 years.  After 2 years of supplementation with glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, alone or in combination, there was no benefit in slowing the loss of cartilage, in terms of joint space width, when compared to a placebo or celecoxib.&lt;ref name=GAIT2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sawitzke AD, Shi H, Finco MF, Dunlop DD, Bingham CO, Harris CL, Singer NG, Bradley JD, Silver D, Jackson CG, Lane NE, Oddis CV, Wolfe F, Lisse J, Furst DE, Reda DJ, Moskowitz RW, Williams HJ, Clegg DO  | title = The effect of glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulfate on the progression of knee osteoarthritis: a report from the glucosamine/chondroitin arthritis intervention trial | journal = Arthritis and Rheumatism | volume = 58 | issue = 10 | pages = 3183–91 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18821708 | pmc = 2836125 | doi = 10.1002/art.23973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the original GAIT study, this follow-up study was confounded by unexpected results that made if difficult to conclude anything definitive about the effect of glucosamine on slowing the progression of OA. Despite the fact that the glucosamine group showed less than one-tenth the joint narrowing (0.013&amp;nbsp;mm) as the placebo group (0.166&amp;nbsp;mm), none of the groups experienced joint space narrowing to the degree the researchers expected (0.4&amp;nbsp;mm) over the two-year period based on earlier studies of OA disease progression. Thus, while the researchers rightly concluded that no treatment in this study was found to produce a "a clinically important reduction" in joint space width loss&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/news/2008/092908.htm |title=Dietary Supplements Glucosamine and/or Chondroitin Fare No Better than Placebo in Slowing Structural Damage of Knee Osteoarthritis |publisher=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; none of the participants experienced clinically important progression of their disease during the study period either.  In another 2-year follow-up study involving 662 patients from the GAIT trial, published in 2010, there was neither significant pain reduction nor improved function when comparing glucosamine and/or chondroitin to a placebo although the positive control also failed to perform significantly better that the placebo in this study.&lt;ref name="pmid20525840"/&gt;

== Quality of clinical studies of glucosamine and chondroitin supplements ==
Glucosamine supplements are widely used for both human and animal joint conditions, at times supported by clinical studies.

However a 2008/2009 [[metastudy]] reviewed all existing studies on the efficacy of glucosamine treatments and supplements for horses, and concluded negatively, that these studies were usually fatally flawed due to [[confirmation bias]] (studies are funded by manufacturers with an incentive to show that benefits exist and commercial pressures that disfavor larger and more thorough studies which would be expensive) and fatal flaws in the design of the study which undermined the conclusions.

The authors observed that existing studies of glucosamine products are "usually [undertaken] on products already commercially available and often seeking evidence for efficacy ... but most do not meet a quality standard that provides sufficient confidence in the results".&lt;ref name=pubmed1&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19927591 | volume=41 | issue=7 | title=Low quality of evidence for glucosamine-based nutraceuticals in equine joint disease: review of in vivo studies | date=September 2009 | journal=Equine Vet. J. | pages=706–12 | vauthors=Pearson W, Lindinger M | doi=10.2746/042516409x424153}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper by the same authors at the 4th European Equine Nutrition &amp; Health Congress (2008) concluded that research into glucosamine-based supplements, for horses at least, has so far "failed to produce substantial evidence for the functionality of these products in this species", and that almost every study they had examined had been&lt;ref name=proceedings1&gt;[http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/eenhc/2008/pearson.pdf Critical review of research evaluating glucosamine-based nutraceuticals for treatment of joint pain and degenerative joint disease in horses] – Pearson and Lindinge, Proceedings of the 4th European Equine Nutrition &amp; Health Congress, April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

compromised to varying degrees by numerous experimental factors including underpowered studies, unbalanced research design, non-existent or inappropriate controls, unclear or non-representative experimental conditions (i.e. models) and uncharacterized or complex, heterogeneous experimental materials"''.&lt;ref name=proceedings1 /&gt;

The most common flaws included:

* Not verifying whether the quantities and condition of active ingredients was as described ("a well-known characteristic of the nutraceuticals industry is one of inconsistent quality control");&lt;ref name=proceedings1 /&gt;
* Ignoring known research in the field and standard precautions, such as accounting for quantities available in blood plasma;&lt;ref name=proceedings1 /&gt;
* In many of the studies, no reliable [[control group]] existed, or there was inadequately controlled control group, or inadequate baseline data, meaning that reliable conclusion could not be drawn about any purported benefits actually resulting from the product.  Controls are a fundamental part of such studies, and the authors comment that "many cases of lameness&amp;nbsp;... improve over time without any treatment at all&amp;nbsp;...  which suggests that the [[null hypothesis]] tested in this study had a good chance of being rejected even in the absence of any treatment" and that "having no such controls leaves the authors and readers with no way in which to tease out effects of growth and/or exercise from effects of glucosamine".&lt;ref name=proceedings1 /&gt;

David Marlin, a past senior scientist and head of physiology at the [[Animal Health Trust]] in [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://davidmarlin.co.uk/about/ | title=David Marlin » About}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented on his website on the evidence concerning glucosamine-based supplements for humans and animals, including a list of studies since 2009. As at 2016 he concludes that some degree of evidence exists for benefits from supplements, and that "[even if] oral joint supplements have little or no efficacy, we might consider that feeding them at least allows owners to feel they are doing something positive for their animals and that any improvement may be due to the placebo effect and therefore there is little risk".&lt;ref name=marlin1&gt;[http://davidmarlin.co.uk/portfolio/equine-joint-supplements-what-scientific-evidence-is-there-to-support-their-use/ "Equine joint supplements – what scientific evidence is there to support their use?"] – David marlin website, 2016--4-07&lt;/ref&gt; However against this he highlights concerns of overdosing, that shark cartilage products may promote rather than reduce inflammation, and produces have been found to be contaminated with [[steroid]]s.&lt;ref name=marlin1 /&gt; He also states that "on closer scrutiny" studies continue to raise concerns for similar reasons as described in the 2008/2009 study&lt;ref name=marlin1 /&gt;:

{{quote|...based on simple mistakes such as lack of control groups, lack of blinding (use of a placebo), insufficient power (not enough subjects to demonstrate a significant effect even if one was present) and inappropriate statistics (for example, multiple t-tests without correction or use of parametric statistics on non-normally distributed data).

{{quote|...research and development investment will at most be modest and in the majority of cases, non- existent. The efficacy of different oral joint supplements will depend on the specific ingredients used and their individual efficacy, the number of different ingredients, the level at which the active ingredients are to be fed, whether the finished product on the shelf actually meets the label claims".&lt;ref name=marlin1 /&gt;}}

===Further metastudies===
Due to the controversy engendered by these results, additional meta-analyses have been undertaken in an attempt to evaluate glucosamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richy F, Bruyere O, Ethgen O, Cucherat M, Henrotin Y, Reginster JY | title = Structural and symptomatic efficacy of glucosamine and chondroitin in knee osteoarthritis: a meta-analysis | journal = [[Archives of Internal Medicine]] | volume = 163 | issue = 13 | pages = 1514–22 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12860572 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.163.13.1514 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 review found little evidence that glucosamine was better than placebo at reversing or restoring degenerative changes to articular cartilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirkham SG, Samarasinghe RK | title = Review article: Glucosamine | journal = Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery (Hong Kong) | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 72–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19398798 | doi = 10.1177/230949900901700116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One published in 2010 in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' arrived at the following conclusions:&lt;blockquote&gt;Compared with placebo, glucosamine, chondroitin, and their combination do not reduce joint pain or affect the narrowing of joint space. Health authorities and health insurers should not cover the costs of these preparations, and new prescriptions to patients who have not received treatment should be discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wandel S, Jüni P, Tendal B, Nüesch E, Villiger PM, Welton NJ, Reichenbach S, Trelle S | title = Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 341 | issue = sep16 2 | pages = c4675 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20847017 | pmc = 2941572 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c4675 | quote = Compared with placebo, glucosamine, chondroitin, and their combination do not reduce joint pain or have an impact on narrowing of joint space }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These conclusions, however, are not shared by all researchers in the field. Specifically, the authors of the 2010 ''BMJ'' meta-analysis have been criticized for poor methodology by including too many dissimilar studies in their analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giacovelli G, Rovati LC | title = Glucosamine and osteoarthritis. Conclusions not supported by methods and results | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 341 | pages = c6338 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21062886 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c6338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent discussion the editors of the ''BMJ'' concluded that, while they still supported the overall results of the study, they no longer accepted the specific conclusions that glucosamine and chondroitin should not be recommended by health authorities or covered by health insurers, stating that these claims "were not directly supported by [the authors'] data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/11/03/report-bmj-post-publication-review-meeting|title=Report from BMJ post publication review meeting|author=Groves T|year=2010|accessdate=17 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in 2012, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) maintained its position (first published in a comprehensive 2004 letter) that there is no credible scientific evidence to support the proposed health claims regarding consumption of [[glucosamine]] and chondroitin sulfate and reduced risk of osteoarthritis, joint degeneration, and cartilage deterioration.&lt;ref name="FDA2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm073400.htm|title=Letter Regarding the Relationship Between the Consumption of Glucosamine and/or Chondroitin Sulfate and a Reduced Risk of: Osteoarthritis; Osteoarthritis-related Joint Pain, Joint Tenderness, and Joint Swelling; Joint Degeneration; and Cartilage Deterioration(Docket No. 2004P-0059)|author=Hubbard WK, Associate Commissioner of Policy and Planning|date=October 7, 2004|publisher=United States Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=14 May 2014}} (Updated 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, a review highlighted the ongoing conflicting clinical data regarding the efficacy of [[glucosamine]] concluding both that  1) "...glucosamine sulfate shows an effect size superior to (or at least equal to) the commonly used analgesic or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but has no rare or adverse effects" and 2) the majority of clinical trials assessing glucosamine reported a significant number of subjects who failed to respond to treatment, thereby questioning the benefit of glucosamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Henrotin Y, Mobasheri A, Marty M | title = Is there any scientific evidence for the use of glucosamine in the management of human osteoarthritis? | journal = Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 201 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22293240 | pmc = 3392795 | doi = 10.1186/ar3657 }}/&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 review and analysis conducted by the La Universidad del Zulia located in Maracaibo, Venezuela and funded by the Venezuelan government's Technological, Humanistic, and Scientific Development Council concluded that the preponderance of the available evidence indicates that [[glucosamine]], specifically the sulfate form, has disease-modifying effects and provides symptomatic relief for at least some individuals suffering from OA. The report classified [[glucosamine]] as a Symptomatic Slow Acting Drugs for Osteoarthritis (SYSADOA) and states: &lt;blockquote&gt; Although further research is required...glucosamine supplements have been more than sufficiently proven to display overtly beneficial risk-to-reward profiles, and they should remain fundamental components of OA therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salazar J, Bello L, Chávez M, Añez R, Rojas J, Bermúdez V | title = Glucosamine for Osteoarthritis: Biological Effects, Clinical Efficacy, and Safety on Glucose Metabolism | journal = Arthritis | volume = 2014 | pages = 1–13 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24678419 | pmc = 3941227 | doi = 10.1155/2014/432463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further meta-analysis published in December 2014 by the Parker Institute (Copenhagen, Denmark) sponsored by the Oak Foundation concluded that glucosamine sulfate, but not glucosamine HCl, did have a significant effect on [[osteoarthritis]] pain but only when one particular brand was used. Once this effect size was corrected for bias and heterogeneity, the effect size became clinically unimportant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Summary of results===
Many [[randomized controlled trial]]s have been conducted with mixed results. These trials have been summarized:

Use of chondroitin in routine clinical practice should therefore be discouraged."
* Also in 2007, Bruyere ''et al.''&lt;ref name="pmid17658908"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bruyere O, Reginster JY | title = Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate as therapeutic agents for knee and hip osteoarthritis | journal = Drugs Aging | volume = 24 | issue = 7 | pages = 573–80 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17658908 | pmc =  | doi = 10.2165/00002512-200724070-00005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; without using explicit methodology for reviewing trials concluded "there is compelling evidence that glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate may interfere with progression of OA."

Prior to publication of the negative review by Reichenbach&lt;ref name="pmid17438317"/&gt; and the equivocal GAIT trial,&lt;ref name="pmid16495392"/&gt; [[clinical practice guideline]]s recommended the use of chondroitin.

However, in the moderate-to-severe pain subgroup, the combination of chondroitin and glucosamine was found to be clinically more effective (in 25% of the patients) in treating pain than [[celecoxib]] or chondroitin and glucosamine taken individually. Due to small sample sizes in the sub-group (roughly 250 people), the researchers concluded that this needs further validation. The study also found chondroitin sulfate to have no significant effect in reducing joint swelling, effusion, or both. These results indicate that glucosamine and chondroitin do not effectively relieve pain in the overall group of [[osteoarthritis]] patients, though it may be an effective treatment for those suffering from moderate-to-severe pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/research/results/gait/qa.htm#c1 |title=Questions and Answers: NIH Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial Primary Study |publisher=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) |date=October 2008 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow-up study, 572 patients from the GAIT Trial continued the supplementation for two years. After two years of supplementation with glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, alone or in combination, there was no benefit in slowing the loss of cartilage, in terms of joint space width, when compared to a placebo.&lt;ref name="GAIT2008" /&gt;  However, no patient group, placebo or glucosamine alone, or in combination, experienced joint space width loss at even half the rate expected during this study, making it difficult to assess the clinical effectiveness of any treatment on the progression of OA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nccih.nih.gov/news/2008/092908.htm | title=Dietary Supplements Glucosamine and/or Chondroitin Fare No Better than Placebo in Slowing Structural Damage of Knee Osteoarthritis| date=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another two-year follow-up study, there was no significant pain reduction or improved function when compared to either inactive placebo or celecoxib&lt;ref name="pmid20525840"/&gt; Some of the researchers' ties to Pfizer (which makes celecoxib) have brought into question the validity of the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/did-you-understand-the-ar_b_16399.html |author=Jay Gordon, MD |title=Did You Understand the Arthritis Study? I Did |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2006-02-26 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lead author of the GAIT Trial, Allen D. Sawitzke, MD, expressed his disappointment with unexpectedly equivocal findings of the trial, noting in an interview with the Arthritis Foundation, that because of significant limitations, like a small sample size, the GAIT Trial likely didn’t have enough power to determine whether glucosamine and chondroitin are effective treatments for knee osteoarthritis or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arthritistoday.org/news/glucosamine-chondroitin-ineffective.php | title=Glucosamine and Chrondroitin for Arthritis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The LEGS study (2007 – 2011)==

The Long-term Evaluation of Glucosamine Sulfate (LEGS) study ran between 2007 and 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00513422 | title=The Long-term Evaluation of Glucosamine Sulphate Study - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; to study whether glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate or a combination of both are effective treatments for chronic knee pain due to [[osteoarthritis]]. 502 patients (from 605 enrolled) were followed for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.|first1=Fransen|title=Glucosamine and chondroitin for knee osteoarthritis: a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating single and combination regimens.|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|date=May 2015|volume=74|issue=5|pages=851–858|doi=10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-203954|pmid=24395557}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main outcomes were disease progression, as measured by joint space narrowing (JSN) and knee pain ([[Visual analog scale|VAS]]). The combination treatment did result in a small but statistically significant (0.1&amp;nbsp;mm) decrease in 2-year JSN compared with placebo but there was no difference in JSN between this group and the other treatment groups and no differences between any group for changes in knee pain. In summary, there was no significant symptomatic benefit detected for these dietary supplements, and a longer study would be required to test the efficacy of both supplements combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The LEGS Study: Do Glucosamine and Chondroitin Show Promise for Pain?|url=http://www.puppywire.com/the-legs-study-do-glucosamine-and-chondroitin-show-promise-for-pain/|publisher=PuppyWire|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa''' ('''DATA''') was a multinational [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organization]] founded in January 2002 in [[London]] by [[U2]]'s [[Bono]] along with [[Robert Sargent Shriver III|Bobby Shriver]] and [[activist]]s from the [[Jubilee 2000]] [[Drop the Debt]] campaign.

DATA was created for the purposes of obtaining [[social equality|equality]] and [[justice]] for Africa through [[debt relief]], adjusting [[trade]] rules which burden Africa, eliminating the epidemic of [[AIDS in Africa]], strengthening [[democracy]], furthering [[accountability]] by the wealthiest nations and African leaders, and [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] towards the people. In 2007, in the United States, DATA and [[Bono]] were jointly awarded the [[National Constitution Center]]'s 2007 [[Liberty Medal]] for their groundbreaking efforts to address the [[AIDS]] crisis and [[extreme poverty]] in Africa.

Start-up funds came from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], financier [[George Soros]], and technology entrepreneur [[Edward W. Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Expert Group Meeting (EGM): prevention of violence against women and girls''' was convened as part of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]]'s multi-year programme of work for 2010-2014. The "Elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls" forms a priority theme for its fifty-seventh session in 2013 (CSW57).

The meeting took place in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] 17–20 September 2012 and was organised by the [[United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]] ([[UN Women]]), in collaboration with the following organisations:
*[[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (ESCAP);
*[[United Nations Development Programme]] ([[UNDP]]);
*[[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA);
*[[United Nations Children’s Fund]] ([[UNICEF]]) and;
*[[World Health Organization]] ([[WHO]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/en/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls/ EGM announced, [[UN Women]]'s website.]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 28 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''EGM note 2''&lt;br /&gt; The report reflects the shared discussion and analysis of the major issues, gaps and challenges identified at the EGM and presents key findings and recommendations. It was intended to build on the individual papers on specific issues provided by experts prior to the meeting, and the background paper prepared by the rapporteur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=17 Sep 2012 - 20 Sep 2012 09:00 AM to 6:00 PM |url=http://www.unwomen.org/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of |title=violence-against-women-and-girls/ Background papers are available on the EGM website |publisher=Unwomen.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides inputs for the reports of the Secretary-General to the CSW and widely disseminated in preparation to the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women#Session reports|fifty-seventh session of CSW (CSW57)]].

==Organisation of work==
''EGM notes 3 to 5''&lt;br /&gt;
The EGM brought together a diverse group of people from different backgrounds and regions including [[#Participants|academics, practitioners, representatives from women’s organisations and staff members of the United Nations system.]]

The experts elected a drafting committee (including two co-chairs) which was tasked to draft the report of the meeting, P miconclusions and recommendations. The following experts were elected to the drafting committee:
*[[Sunila Abeysekera]] (Co-Chair)
*Marai Larasi (Co-Chair)
*Fatuma Chegue
*Edwina Kotoisuva
*Tatiana Moura
*[[Hibaaq Osman]]
*Jeanne Ward
*Lara Fergus (Rapporteur)

==Introduction==
''EGM note 6''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that violence against women and girls is defined as ‘any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women [or girls], including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.’{{ref|a}} It exists in multiple, interrelated and sometimes recurring forms, and is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women.{{ref|b}}

''EGM note 7''&lt;br /&gt; Experts stressed that we are at a critical moment where international bodies, nation states and civil society can and must come together to solidify commitments to ending violence against women and girls, as fragile and – in many places – deteriorating economic conditions, persistent environmental degradation, internal conflicts and wars, all contribute to the exacerbation of violence against women and girls, and violations of their rights.

''EGM note 8''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that the impacts of the global financial crisis, the economic pressures on Governments to reduce funding to social services and programmes, and the ongoing resource constraints faced by conflict-affected and developing countries, all risk limiting or reducing the investment States will make in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls.

''EGM note 9''&lt;br /&gt; However, they highlighted the enormous costs violence against women and girls entails to States and societies as a whole, in terms of reduced human capital, decreased productivity, exacerbated social inequalities, lowered overall educational outcomes, and broad strains on public services. Violence diminishes women’s and girls’ ability to gain an education, earn a living and participate in public life, and live a life free of fear. It has significant health impacts, including psychological consequences, physical injuries, sexual/reproductive health issues and death.{{ref|c}} In war-affected settings, violence against women and girls inhibits efforts towards peace-building and sustainable recovery, contributing to the risk of resurgent conflict. In development settings, it hinders progress towards achievement of several of the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)]], including those relating to [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education|education]], [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases|HIV/AIDS]], [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 5: Improve maternal health|maternal health]] and [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 4: Reduce child mortality rates|child mortality]].{{ref|d}} It has intergenerational impacts, given that women use disproportionately more of their income toward supporting their families, and because violence diminishes their ability to fully participate in their societies (for example in politics, work or education) they are less able to invest in their children’s futures. One study in Chile found that women’s lost earnings alone as a result of domestic violence cost US$1.56 billion or more than 2 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product.{{ref|e}}

''EGM note 10''&lt;br /&gt; Violence against women and girls therefore entails massive costs to the State, and has a dragging effect on all other social and economic development efforts, particularly in humanitarian and development contexts. It is only by lowering the incidence of violence against women and girls, preventing recurrence, and responding effectively to existing violence to minimise ongoing impacts, that the overall costs of such violence to any economy will be reduced.{{ref|f}} Experts noted that, in the face of such evidence, prevention is not only possible, but central to the social and economic advancement of developed and developing countries alike. It was reiterated that all States have not only a responsibility to significantly strengthen their planning and budgeting efforts for prevention of violence against women and girls, but that doing so will contribute to positive social and economic outcomes.

''EGM note 11''&lt;br /&gt; Experts brought together experiences from across developing and developed countries, and from humanitarian contexts (arising from conflict and natural disasters), demonstrating that violence against women and girls could be prevented regardless of political, social and economic conditions. Levels of violence against women and girls vary across countries that with similar economic status or political systems – a variation that can be attributed to different laws, policies, practices, norms, behaviours and attitudes that contribute to, justify or excuse violence against women and girls. Such factors must be targeted to prevent and reduce violence within and across all settings.

''EGM note 12''&lt;br /&gt; Across developing and developed countries alike, more comprehensive, multi-sectoral and sustained approaches were recognised as necessary to achieve such change, with investments commensurate to the enormous scale of the abuse and its impacts. While the allocation of more resources to prevention remained high on the priority list for experts, political will was also identified as a key factor. It was noted that organisations and communities in some developing countries have led the way in testing and expanding new models for prevention, however experts did not believe any State was currently meeting its full normative obligations in this area.

''EGM note 13''&lt;br /&gt; Experts reiterated that violence against women and girls is a pervasive and systematic human rights violation, caused by – and reinforcing – gender inequality and entrenched discrimination. While most violence against women and girls is committed by non-State actors or individuals (usually men known to the victims/survivors, often husbands/intimate partners or other family members), experts were adamant that laws, policies and practices emanating from the State – as well as from traditional or customary practices – could also result in direct violence against women and girls, fail to respond to it, or create an environment where such violence was tolerated, excused or justified.

''EGM note 14''&lt;br /&gt; To this end, experts noted that the prevention of violence against women and girls could not be achieved without the full implementation of the existing legal obligation on States – under the ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]]'' to ‘take all appropriate measures to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women,’{{ref|g}} along with the more detailed obligations relating to the elimination of violence against women and girls outlined in the ''[[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (BPfA)]]''.{{ref|h}}&lt;ref name="Source2"&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/ Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), [[UN Women]]. Retrieved 28 February 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; Experts emphasised, as central to the latter, the obligation on States to ‘refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations’{{ref|i}} to eliminate violence against women and girls.

''EGM note 15''&lt;br /&gt; A key message from experts was that the call for greater efforts to prevent violence against women and girls is not a ‘new demand,’ but well supported by international legal and normative frameworks. What is new is the emergence, in recent years, of an unprecedented evidence and practice base that provides concrete guidance on the application of proven and effective strategies, and makes prevention of violence against women and girls a tangible and measurable goal. We now know that to effectively prevent violence against women and girls, efforts must go beyond simple awareness-raising projects and instead work to actively (and measurably) transform discriminatory and violence-supportive attitudes and behaviours, community norms, institutional practices and systems, laws and policies, and society as a whole.

''EGM note 16''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that this holistic and comprehensive approach to prevention has the potential to create numerous benefits for communities beyond reductions in violence, because it also addresses the discrimination, inequality and other violence-supportive practices and behaviours that contribute to a range of social ills. Prevention of violence against women and girls is ultimately about building relationships, communities and organisations that are equal, non-violent and respectful of all individuals. It results in the creation of more peaceful, egalitarian and productive societies where women and girls live free from the discrimination, harassment, violence and fear of violence that can block them from reaching their full human potential.

===Defining prevention===
''EGM note 17''&lt;br /&gt; The focus of the meeting (and this report) was on prevention of violence against women and girls ''before it occurs'', that is, by identifying and addressing its underlying causes and promoting shifts in the social environment that ultimately reduce the number of new incidents of violence against women and girls.

''EGM note 18''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that prevention of violence against women and girls remains a poorly understood concept across sectors and stakeholders. Prevention is often conflated with early intervention or the response to existing violence, or else limited to awareness raising or social marketing campaigns. Simplistic analyses and programmes aimed at single-cause factors such as alcohol abuse, or placing the responsibility to prevent violence on women and girls themselves (such as self-defence programmes) can in some cases do more harm than good, and are not uncommon. Cynical perceptions that violence against women and girls is somehow an inevitable part of society, and that efforts to prevent it are well-intentioned but ultimately ineffective, are also widespread. There is therefore a need to build not only evidence, but shared understandings of the complexity and causes of violence against women and girls, and of how it can be effectively prevented.

''EGM note 19''&lt;br /&gt; Experts recognised that this transformative agenda engages all levels of the socio-political system, from policy and legislative development, to the development and delivery of programmes and services ‘on the ground’, and the capacity building of the institutions responsible for implementation. Confronting existing social and gendered realities that continue to use arguments based on culture, customs and ‘traditional’ values and practices to justify discrimination and violence against women and girls, and treat them as subordinate and second-class citizens, remains a major challenge in addressing the social and cultural environments that permit violence against women and girls to flourish with impunity. As the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences has noted: ‘no form of interpersonal violence against women is devoid of structural violence – as in all places, such abuse is underpinned by beliefs about the perpetrator’s right to harm another, based on societal notions of gender and rights.’{{ref|j}}

''EGM note 20''&lt;br /&gt; Experts were particularly keen to convey that, in prevention terms, violence against women and girls in the private sphere and/or perpetrated by non-State actors could ''not'' be considered as something ‘separate’ from the actions of the State. Experts stressed that violence against women and girls – in every context – can be perpetuated by State decision-making mechanisms, laws, policies and practices when these systematically marginalize women and girls and/or fail to promote their rights. These include not only legal policies and programs that fail to criminalize violence against women and girls or adequately punish it, but also State-sanctioned discrimination, for example: excluding women from political participation (such as assemblies, high-level government positions, and key decision-making bodies like constitutional committees); constitutional language that threatens women’s rights (whether existing or developing in emerging State structures); or discriminatory laws, policies and budgets which disproportionately limit women’s and girls’ rights, neglect their voices and concerns, and fail to promote full substantive, as well as formal, equality between men and women.

''EGM note 21''&lt;br /&gt; State-sanctioned violence and discrimination against women is significantly tied to cultural and social norms that pervade a nation, which are then used to justify, excuse or tolerate violence against women and girls. When laws and policies limit women’s freedoms or deem women as ‘complementary’ instead of ‘equal to’ men, this trickles down to public perception of women and girls and their role in society, and undermines their safety and security within the State. These social and cultural norms are similarly impacted by the respect, or otherwise, of women’s civil and political rights (such as their political participation), and their economic, social and cultural rights (such as their access to work and education). Greater levels of social and economic equality between men and women, for instance, are closely correlated with lower levels of violence against women and girls at the population level. Similarly, greater visibility of women in leadership roles, including in constitution committees, assemblies and high-level posts in government, in peacekeeping troops and in peace-building talks, promotes positive and egalitarian norms and combats gender stereotypes in a way that counters discriminatory and violence-supportive attitudes and the marginalization of women and girls.

''EGM note 22''&lt;br /&gt; Prevention of violence against women and girls is often conceptualised in terms of awareness raising or community mobilisation, and these are important components. Experts reiterated the importance of grassroots community mobilisation in driving attitudinal and behavioural transformation at the local level. However, in light of the above, experts stressed the more expansive and multi-level nature of effective prevention, in particular the critical role of government to create an ‘enabling environment’ through undertaking policy, legislative and budgetary reform to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment, and actively address the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and disadvantage that place women and girls at risk of violence. They emphasised the additional role of States in providing support to women’s and other civil society actors, including women, men and youth community and religious leaders and opinion-makers, in their prevention efforts.

''EGM note 23''&lt;br /&gt; Experts further stressed the importance of continued investment in an effective ''response'' to existing violence against women and girls – including through improving legislative, police, justice and service systems{{ref|k}} – as a fundamental ‘building block’ for prevention, establishing accountability and redress, and protecting women and girls from further violence. Effective response systems are also necessary to ensure support of women and girls who may identify violence in their own lives as a direct result of prevention activity and seek help and redress. Experts acknowledged that a separate stream of work on building an effective multi-sectoral response was being undertaken in preparation for CSW.

''EGM note 24''&lt;br /&gt; Experts recommended that prevention and response strategies be developed and implemented as a holistic and integrated system that upholds the human rights of girls and women to live in societies, communities and families that are free of such violence. However, while essential, experts noted the evidence that an effective response has, in itself, only a limited impact on reducing the number of new incidents of violence. Specific actions to address the foundations of violence – discriminatory and violence-supportive practices, laws, norms, behaviours and attitudes – are also necessary in order to prevent violence against women and girls from happening in the first place, within and across all settings. These are the focus of discussions and recommendations in this Report.

===Describing the context===
''EGM note 25''&lt;br /&gt; The emphasis on economic growth in the development agenda globally has led to growing inequalities and a reduced focus on redistribution. The rolling economic crises currently gripping almost all of the world’s countries has resulted in increased unemployment and poverty, a shortage of housing, and cutbacks in social spending including subsidies for health and education. These multiple crises have in turn fuelled communal and ethnic tensions, mass migration and displacement, rendering millions homeless and poor, and more vulnerable to trafficking and diverse forms of exploitation. In most communities, this also results in the heightened vulnerability of women and girls to violence and exploitation.

''EGM note 26''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted the evidence that violence against women and girls is intensified and exacerbated in situations of socio-economic stress, conflict and other crisis situations. In addition to the impact of economic crises described above, global warming and associated rising sea levels and severe weather events, as well as environmental degradation and resource depletion, can all contribute to conditions of social and economic vulnerability, including homelessness and mass migrations. They can also lead to the disaster or crisis situations in which violence against women and girls is known to increase.

''EGM note 27''&lt;br /&gt; As discrimination based on sex and gender continues to dominate social formations even in the 21st century, experts noted that violence against women and girls continues to be perceived as ‘normal’ in many contexts. The pervasive nature of militarization and the growth of all forms of religious fundamentalisms and other forms of extreme nationalism creates cultures where women are reduced to being symbolic ‘bearers’ of their culture and have their mobility and autonomy restricted in many different ways.

''EGM note 28''&lt;br /&gt; Exacerbated by the conditions described above (and even without them) women and girls experience daily harassment, abuse, discrimination and violence across the numerous settings in which they conduct their lives, from workplaces, schools and other educational institutions, community and faith organisations and groups, market places, shops, on public transport, in social settings, online and via social media, during flight and while displaced as a result of conflict and natural disasters, and above all in their homes.

''EGM note 29''&lt;br /&gt; Experts also identified emerging contexts and issues that have an impact on violence against women and girls. For example, experts agreed that the role of new media presents a number of layered and complex challenges, as well as opportunities, for the prevention of violence against women and girls. In the first instance, new media is often a platform for the perpetuation of harmful masculinities and the objectification of women and girls. This can take a number of forms from everyday hyper-sexualised, one-dimensional images of women and girls to hard-core pornography which has moved from the peripheries to the mainstream of the pornography industry. Virtual spaces are also utilised to perpetuate direct attacks on women and girls. This can range from cyber-stalking to the posting of inappropriate images / videos of women. For example, women have increasingly reported incidents of footage of them engaged in sexual activity (filmed both with and without consent) being posted on internet sites without their consent. In a number of cases this has included the posting of footage of actual rapes.{{ref|l}}

''EGM note 30''&lt;br /&gt; Violence in the virtual space and the wider issues of how women and girls are objectified in the media has particular implications for girls and younger women, who are much more like to engage with social networking sites, instant messaging, etc. Despite the range of violations, incidents can be hard to prosecute, especially as the internet is not limited to nation spaces. There are also real challenges around balancing the right to freedom of expression with the right to be protected from discrimination.{{ref|m}}

Their One Man Can campaign tackles [[HIV]] and [[gender-based violence]].]]
''EGM note 31''&lt;br /&gt; Experts also noted with concern the emerging evidence that adolescent girls and young women may also be targeted for sexual violence in the context of serious youth violence (e.g. youth gangs) and/or broader urban violence. They may also be members of gangs themselves and involved in perpetration of violence against other young women and girls within or between gangs. Experts further expressed the concern that adolescent girls and young women were frequently overlooked in policy and programming responses designed for young men, adult women or for children in general, yet the context of their lives may be quite distinct and require specific approaches, particularly given they are the age group at greatest risk of sexual violence.{{ref|n}}

''EGM note 32''&lt;br /&gt; In humanitarian crises caused by conflict and/or natural disasters, women and girls are at risk of violence throughout all stages: during crises, during flight from crises, while living in displaced settings, and during and following return. In situations of armed conflict, women and girls can be exposed to violence at the hands of armed actors, including soldiers and military assigned to protect civilians and assist in their safe flight from conflict. They may be recruited into armed groups and serve as sexual slaves to combatants. In some settings women and girls continue to be used as ‘weapons of war,’ subject to sexual assault by all parties to conflict, at times in front of their husbands, children, and other family or community members.

''EGM note 33''&lt;br /&gt; While much attention has been accorded to sexual violence against women and girls during conflict, they suffer many additional forms of violence in humanitarian emergencies, including sexual exploitation, trafficking, early marriage, and [[intimate partner violence]].{{ref|o}} Experts noted that all of these forms of violence can be averted or reduced with effective prevention programming from the contingency planning phase through to recovery, and States’ responsibilities to work towards the prevention of this violence are reinforced by a broad normative framework mandating protection of women and girls from sexual and other forms of violence in emergencies. And yet, prevention programming remains weak in virtually every humanitarian setting around the world.

''EGM note 34''&lt;br /&gt; Experts further noted the evidence that while more than 740,000 men, women, and children die each year as a result of armed violence, the majority of these deaths – 490,000 – occur in countries that are not affected by conflict.{{ref|p}} The proliferation of small arms increases the vulnerability of women and girls to violence, and exacerbates the seriousness of that violence. This is particularly true in the context of urban/serious youth (e.g. gang) violence (referred to above), but also in the case of violence in the home, where the presence of small arms significantly increases the risk of the victim being killed.{{ref|q}} The violent deaths of approximately 66,000 women and girls are attributed to armed violence globally each year.{{ref|r}}

''EGM note 35''&lt;br /&gt; Experts were finally keen to emphasise that – even within the same geographic or socio-political setting, ‘context’ was not the same thing for different women and girls. Women and girls often experience multiple and intersecting forms of social disadvantage and discrimination (in addition to that based on gender), and this compounds their individual and collective vulnerability to violence. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, has recently noted that theories on violence have often ‘failed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how various forms of discrimination, beyond a male/female gender binary, contextualize, exacerbate, and correlate to high levels of violence in given societies. The lack of an intersectional approach can lead to the reinforcing of one form of discrimination in attempts to alleviate another.’{{ref|s}} Factors such as race, ethnicity, caste, class, age, religion, sexual orientation, marital status, geographic location, disability, HIV status or status as a refugee or internally displaced person, will all influence the forms and nature of violence women and girls may suffer, and the relationship of these factors to prevention is discussed in the ‘Key Findings’ section.

==Global policy and legislative / normative framework (abridged)==
''EGM note 36''&lt;br /&gt; The international community is committed to eliminating violence against women and girls{{ref|t}} and has recognised – in various global and regional legal and policy instruments – the important role of prevention towards this end.

''EGM note 37''&lt;br /&gt; Above all, State responsibility for prevention of violence against women and girls through social and behavioural change is supported by the foundational treaty on women’s human rights, the ''Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women'' (CEDAW), which establishes signatories’ legal obligation to take ‘all appropriate measures [to] modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women.’{{ref|u}}  General Recommendation 19 of the CEDAW Committee defines violence as a form of discrimination against women, and establishes the obligation of States to act with ‘due diligence’ to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls.

''EGM note 38''&lt;br /&gt; The ''Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women'' enhanced the definition of violence against women and also included protection of women from violence committed in the private domain as being an obligation of the state.{{ref|v}} Responsibilities of the State to prevent violence, abuse and neglect of girls are further supported by the ''Convention on the Rights of the Child'', requiring States parties to ‘take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse’ including ‘forms of prevention,’{{ref|w}} along with its two Optional Protocols.{{ref|x}}

''EGM note 39''&lt;br /&gt; The ''Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action'' (BPfA), adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, recognised the complexity of the underlying causes of violence against women and girls, and the need to link prevention and response activities. Paragraph 118 notes that:&lt;br /&gt;
:''violence against women throughout the life cycle derives essentially from cultural patterns, in particular the harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices and all acts of extremism linked to race, sex, language or religion that perpetuate the lower status accorded to women in the family, the workplace, the community and society. Violence against women is exacerbated by social pressures, notably the shame of denouncing certain acts that have been perpetrated against women; women's lack of access to legal information, aid or protection; the lack of laws that effectively prohibit violence against women; failure to reform existing laws; inadequate efforts on the part of public authorities to promote awareness of and enforce existing laws; and the absence of educational and other means to address the causes and consequences of violence. Images in the media of violence against women, in particular those that depict rape or sexual slavery as well as the use of women and girls as sex objects, including pornography, are factors contributing to the continued prevalence of such violence, adversely influencing the community at large, in particular children and young people.''{{ref|y}}

''EGM notes 40 to 51''&lt;br /&gt; Other global policy and legislative / normative frameworks that are currently in place.

''EGM note 52''&lt;br /&gt; In conclusion, while the normative framework has clearly developed an obligation for States to take holistic, comprehensive, strategic and well-resourced action to prevent violence against women and girls, and while States have increasingly ratified the relevant treaties and in some cases brought these obligations into their legal frameworks, much work remains to be done before the normative obligations will be fully implemented. Gaps remain in terms of resource allocation, legislative and policy development, and systems and mechanisms for coordinated and sustained action.

''EGM note 53''&lt;br /&gt; In considering the above analysis, experts believed that a significant global shift in perceptions was necessary towards greater recognition of the widespread and systematic nature of violence against women and girls, deserving of more serious attention by States and the international community. Experts returned to and supported the international definition of violence against women and girls in the ''Declaration'', i.e. as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against them, that shall mean all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.{{ref|z}}

''EGM note 54''&lt;br /&gt; However, some experts noted that such violence is not isolated or sporadic, but could be seen as part of a widespread or systematic practice intended to humiliate or degrade an identifiable group. As such, they called for violence against women and girls to be considered a crime against humanity. Others cautioned against linking violence against women and girls to current definitions of crimes against humanity, given the existing limitations of international law and jurisprudence. It was noted that the landmark February 2008 judgement of the Sierra Leone Appeals Chamber of the Special Court in the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council case had set an historic precedent in recognising forced marriage as a distinct category of crimes against humanity in international criminal law.{{ref|A}} Experts therefore agreed that calling for violence against women and girls to be recognised as a crime against humanity was intended as an aspirational statement and advocacy goal, one which would expand current definitions and understanding of crimes against humanity – in a way similar to the Sierra Leone case – and help drive a global shift in perceptions towards one that recognises the full seriousness of violence against women and girls, and the urgency with which we must prevent it.

==Key findings (abridged)==
''EGM note 55''&lt;br /&gt; Based on comprehensive discussion at the EGM, review of the papers presented by experts, and an analysis of the global context, normative framework and evidence and practice base, experts agreed on the following key findings. Experts noted the significant development, over recent years, of guidance to States and other stakeholders in the development, implementation and monitoring of policy and programming to prevent violence against women and girls,{{ref|B}} and again
referred to the papers submitted to the EGM as providing further information on current practice. Rather than reiterate that guidance here, experts have confined their findings below to the emerging issues, and those perceived to be of most critical relevance to CSW.

''EGM note 56''&lt;br /&gt; Experts wished to reiterate, as a finding and central tenet of their recommendations, that prevention of violence against women and girls is a positive endeavour, a precondition for enabling women and men to reach their full potential, and is essential to the creation of healthy, equitable, stable and productive communities, workplaces, schools and universities, faith and cultural institutions, sporting and recreation organisations, and societies as a whole.

''EGM note 57''&lt;br /&gt; Noting recent research highlighting the unique and catalysing impact of women’s organisations on enduring and effective policy development to end violence against women and girls,{{ref|C}} experts were unanimous that effective prevention of violence against women and girls was not only often driven by, but ''required'' the involvement of women’s organisations, working in partnership with national, provincial and local Governments, communities, civil society groups, donors, the private sector and other non-state actors.

''EGM note 58''&lt;br /&gt; Experts emphasized the importance of moving away from short-term, ad hoc sensitisation and awareness raising activities and towards more comprehensive, longer-term prevention efforts that are grounded in communities and work systematically to change unequal power relations between women and men. Such social norm change requires working with a cross section of the community from women and men, young people, religious and cultural leaders, health care providers, police, government officials, the media and others, over time and in varied ways, to challenge norms that perpetuate violence and emphasize the positive benefits of non-violence, justice and equality for individuals, families and the broader community. Civil society plays an essential role in mobilising communities to rethink the acceptability of violence and supporting positive change.

''EGM note 59''&lt;br /&gt; However, while women’s and other civil society organisations and communities themselves have been at the forefront of developing the practice and evidence base for prevention programming, factors such as time, reach and workforce constraints can prevent many good initiatives from being evaluated, expanded or otherwise scaled-up. Research has also shown that those working to end violence against women and girls can themselves face discrimination, hostility, repudiation and even violence, precisely because they challenge traditional notions of the family and gender that contribute to such violence.{{ref|D}}

''EGM note 60''&lt;br /&gt;
To maximise the impact and sustainability of such work, therefore, Governments have a key role to play in supporting and creating an enabling environment for women’s organisations and others working to prevent violence against women and girls to continue to drive and innovate prevention programming, safe from violence and discrimination themselves. Governments should also activate their reach and mandate to ensure the scale-up, systematisation and embedding of good practice in laws, policies and through public institutions (e.g. schools, social and health services, media and workplace regulation) for long-term sustainability.

''EGM note 61''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that without States taking their full responsibility for sustained, systematic and coordinated policy, programming and investment for prevention, the transformative social development necessary to end violence against women and girls cannot be achieved. Few States worldwide had implemented their obligations to this end. A 2011 review of National Action Plans on Violence against Women found that most policies were limited to responding to existing violence. Those that did contain specific prevention actions largely focussed on raising awareness of new laws or where to access services, with some containing one-off or single-sector prevention activities such as social marketing campaigns or schools-based programmes. Only one identified plan took a long-term, multi-sectoral and holistic approach to prevention, with appropriate institutional support mechanisms and commensurate investment.{{ref|E}}

''EGM note 62''&lt;br /&gt; Importantly, one-off, single-sector or small-scale interventions, while they may have some effectiveness for participating individuals, are unable to change the social norms at the community or society level that have a dampening effect on such attitudinal change. Therefore, they can never in themselves decrease prevalence of violence against women and girls across society as a whole. Broad and sustainable change is only achieved when such activities are implemented in a long-term and cumulative way, mutually reinforced across various settings. These should be linked to a prevention framework which is coordinated to ensure that all levels are appropriately engaged, with evaluation and monitoring for continuous improvement. It is particularly essential that all strategies and interventions are supported by policy and legislative reform that promotes gender equality, challenges discrimination, and provides an effective response to existing violence.

''EGM notes 63 to 102''&lt;br /&gt; Other key findings from the EGM.

==Report recommendations==
''Recommendation 103''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts stressed the critical importance of women’s organisations, civil society, international institutions, donors and States working together to go beyond ‘ad hoc’ approaches to prevention, and for States to take their responsibility for developing long-term and multi-sectoral strategies so that activity can be coordinated, and evidence built, to achieve real results. With an increased commitment from all actors to such an approach, and corresponding investment, many experts believed violence against women and girls could be ended within a generation. To this end, experts have made recommendations (see below) for a coordinated and target-focussed approach to preventing violence against women and girls, driven by two overarching activities – a [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Global Implementation Plan]] – framing the work of international, regional and national institutions (including States) toward the goal of ending violence against women and girls, along with a  [[Global Advocacy Campaign to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls|Global Advocacy Campaign]] – driven by women’s and other civil society organisations to create momentum and provide accountability for the above.

''Recommendation 104''&lt;br /&gt; Also, given CSW’s specific mandate with regards to implementation of the ''Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action''{{ref|F}} experts have made further recommendations for immediate implementation, aligned with the BPfA’s strategic objectives of taking integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women, and studying the causes and consequences of violence against women and the effectiveness of preventive measures. While the BPfA objectives cover both prevention of, and response to, violence against women and girls, and experts supported full implementation of all of these, the recommendations below build on those areas focussing on prevention.

''Recommendation 105''&lt;br /&gt; Finally, experts identified recommendations arising from emerging issues or gaps in the evidence and practice base regarding prevention of violence against women and girls in certain contexts and settings. These include recommendations for prevention in settings affected by humanitarian crises such as conflict and natural disasters; contexts of serious urban or youth violence; with regards to representation of women and girls in the context of mass media as well as in new social media; and in the context of the global financial crisis and shifting geopolitics. In addition to the broad recommendations below that are relevant to all settings, special attention has been given to certain contexts and settings in order to highlight specific strategies for prevention related to these particular areas of concern. Experts have also chosen to highlight certain recommendations specific to preventing violence against girls, including adolescent girls, and young women, as a frequently overlooked group worthy of special consideration.

=== A global implementation plan to end violence against women and girls ===
[[File:Earth-illustration-blue.jpg|thumb|''[[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|A global implementation plan to end violence against women and girls.]]''(Recommendations 106 -112)]]
''Recommendation 106''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts agreed that while an international legal and normative frame work for preventing violence against women and girls is already in place, there are two major barriers to its implementation. The first is that social and cultural norms and customs are often used as a shroud or excuse for laws, practices and behaviours that are either directly violent and discriminatory towards women and girls, or else contribute to and support violence against them. '''The BPfA clearly calls on States to ‘refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination as set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women,’'''{{ref|G}} and experts were adamant that this entails an active obligation on States to examine their own laws and policies, and challenge the communities, organisations and individuals in their jurisdictions, to eliminate norms and customs that excuse, justify or tolerate violence against women and girls, and which exist in all societies.

''Recommendation 107''&lt;br /&gt;
A second barrier to full implementation of existing obligations is the lack of a coordinated, strategic agenda at international, regional and national levels for '''modifying ‘the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women,’'''{{ref|H}} '''required by [[CEDAW]].''' This is an essential precondition and support for the sustainable prevention of violence against women and girls. As noted above, such prejudices, practices and stereotypes are rampant in all societies, expressed as much through channels such as media and popular culture, as through institutions more identifiable as the bearers of custom or ‘tradition’ (e.g. faith institutions). A much greater commitment and level of resourcing is required from all States, along with significantly improved coordination of policy, programming and research at global, regional and national levels towards a shared strategic agenda to eliminate these and so meet the legal obligation under CEDAW.

''Recommendation 108''&lt;br /&gt;
To this end, an overarching recommendation from experts was that Member States commit, at CSW in 2013, to develop a [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls]], to be launched in 2015, with a particular focus on prevention of violence against women and girls. This Plan should aim to provide vigilance on established international obligations (particularly the overarching BPfA&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; and [[CEDAW]] obligations cited above), and serve as the tool for operationalising these norms into national policy and programming in a coordinated and results-based way.

''Recommendation 109''&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls]], endorsed and supported by Member States at its launch, would aim to:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intensify and scale-up global awareness of violence against women and girls as a global emergency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine the best thinking on how to proceed with concrete pledges for action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobilise international, regional and national action by governments, multilaterals, the private sector and civil society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the foundation for an evidence and practice-informed global prevention strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase resources available to end violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 110''&lt;br /&gt;
Development of the plan should be linked to the processes defining the post-2015 development agenda, to ensure that the prevention of violence against women and girls is rightly understood as crucial to the meeting of other internationally agreed development goals, and that targets relating to the prevention of (and response to) such violence are explicitly identified and well situated in the post-2015 development framework.

''Recommendation 111''&lt;br /&gt;
Development of the plan would require, among other things:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identification of a small set of key policy, legal and programme-delivery targets (institutions) at the national level towards which global violence prevention efforts can be directed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed review of existing action plans, indicators, recommendations, platforms for action, policy agendas, and recommendations outlined by the Security Council, UN Treaty bodies, the special rapporteurs, and various UN agencies, with a view to closing implementation gaps and building the next stage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of a cohesive global community of key stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designation of strong coordinating mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development of an accountability framework with indicators to measure State responsiveness to the policy, legal and programme-delivery goals identified and an independent monitoring mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 112''&lt;br /&gt;
Development of the plan should include the proactive engagement of new partners (such as the private sector, sporting organisations, religious and cultural leaders, the media and entertainment industry), with a critical eye to the internal structures and methods of operation of such partners to ensure they fully support and in no way undermine the human rights of women and girls.

===A global advocacy campaign for prevention===
&lt;!-- [[File:Civilizations map 2.png|thumb|''[[A Global Advocacy Campaign for Prevention.|A global advocacy campaign for prevention]]'' (Recommendations 113 to 114)]] --&gt;
''Recommendation 113''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts further recognised the crucial and catalytic role of women’s organisations and called for them to help build support and momentum for the above. A global ‘movement for prevention’ is needed, engaging a critical mass of individuals, groups and institutions working together to create communities and countries that are safe for women and girls and where their rights are respected.

''Recommendation 114''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts’ second overarching recommendation was therefore that women’s organisations, in partnership with other civil society organisations and identified willing international and regional institutions, States and other relevant parties, lead a [[Global Advocacy Campaign to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls]], as a crucial accompaniment to the development of the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Implementation Plan]] above. [[Global Advocacy Campaign to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls|The Advocacy Campaign]] could include the creation of plain language communications materials, mechanisms to share information and practice, avenues for capacity development, and advocacy strengthening, for example through the training of male and female youth and veteran activists and leaders to monitor progress of nations on international agreements, produce reports, and represent women’s and girls’ priorities and interests in international fora. The aim of [[Global Advocacy Campaign to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls|the Advocacy Campaign]] would be to create momentum for the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Implementation Plan]], ensure the consistent promotion of evidence-informed, rights-based prevention activity, and hold international, regional and national stakeholders accountable to women and girls.

===Integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls===
[[File:No-slavery.jpg|thumb|''Integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls.'' (Recommendations 115 to 125)]]
''Recommendation 115''&lt;br /&gt;''
While the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Global Implementation Plan]] may take one to two years to develop, there are many areas of work that States have already committed to under the BPfA&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; Strategic Objective D1 – to take integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women – and upon which they can and should take immediate action. Below are recommendations elaborated by the experts in line with the growing evidence and practice base on prevention, in support of these existing commitments.

''Recommendation 116''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 124(j), calling on Governments to ‘formulate and implement, at all appropriate levels, plans of action to eliminate violence against women,’and Paragraph 124(p)calling for the allocation of ‘adequate resources within the government budget and mobilis[ation of]community resources for activities related to the elimination of violence against women, including resources for the implementation of plans of action at all appropriate levels,’''' experts recommend that States work in partnership with funders, international and regional institutions, women’s and civil society organisations and other stakeholders to develop, implement,
evaluate and monitor coordinated, multisectoral and sustained prevention strategies, alongside and reinforcing strategies to improve the response to existing violence. Such strategies should
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;address the underlying causes of violence against women and girls in norms and practices at socio-structural, community, organisational, relationship and individual levels, and include a performance monitoring framework, and coordination and accountability mechanisms.&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comprise a variety of coordinated interventions to be implemented in a mutually reinforcing way across settings and sectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include the review and revision of policy and legislation to ensure a consistent whole-of-government framework for the prevention of violence against women and girls that promotes women’s and girls’ human rights and gender equality in line with international norms. This review and reform process should ensure law and policy: aligns with and responds explicitly to State obligations under relevant human rights treaties, intergovernmental agreements and international standards/guidelines, repealing and reforming discriminatory laws and criminalizing violence against women and girls; defines violence against women and girls according to international norms, acknowledging that such violence is a form of discrimination and manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, and the recognising the particular vulnerabilities of girls; and recognises that women’s and girls’ experience of violence is shaped by factors such as disability, age, ethnicity, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, marital status, sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS status, migrant or refugee status and exposure to conflict or natural disaster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be supported by multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms, with the involvement of representatives from across government institutions and also civil society, donors and other stakeholders who can aid in implementation. These mechanisms should begin by identifying where existing capacity could be harnessed in particular programmatic areas for immediate impact (e.g. through existing health or education sectors, or existing nongovernment programming), and provide for the development of capacity (e.g. a human rights training curriculum and mandatory training for all elected officials and civil servants at every level of government) across other sectors for mid to longer-term work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure earmarked budgets are in place in each relevant Ministry – including human and technical resources – to fund such strategies over the short, mid and long-terms. Working to integrate prevention of violence against women and girls into all leading policy and funding frameworks can also provide strategic avenues and a broad base from which to strengthen efforts and secure budgets. Examples of these include poverty reduction and development strategies and national plans, and sector-wide reforms related to education, health, security, justice, HIV and AIDS, peace-building, transitional justice, reconstruction and conflict prevention strategies and frameworks in post-conflict situations, and contingency planning strategies and frameworks in settings affected by cyclical natural disasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set specific targets and include mechanisms for monitoring progress towards them, across implementing institutions, and agencies in international/regional systems. Institutional responsibilities and reporting arrangements against these targets should be articulated, and mechanisms for accountability established. For example, regular and participatory multi-sectoral assessments at the national and local levels, across line ministries and related public sector institutions can strengthen accountability for performance in terms of agreed-upon budgetary commitments and/or related performance on budgetary allocations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aim to create an enabling environment for women’s and civil society organisations working on prevention of violence against women and girls. Resource allocation models should maximise collaboration between community organisations, and continuity of funding for programmes where they are shown to be effective through appropriate evaluation (see recommendation 131).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include – across all settings and frameworks – efforts to engage men and boys in achieving gender equality and preventing violence, informed by the expertise of the women’s sector, and with mechanisms to ensure accountability to women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 117''&lt;br /&gt;''
Experts further recommend that UN agencies mirror what is recognised as good practice for Governments above, and adopt a coordinated, interagency approach to prevent (and respond to) violence against women and girls, with support from the highest political level (i.e. the Secretary General). As part of the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Global Implementation Plan]], UN agencies should develop a system-wide workplan building on related system-wide initiatives (e.g. the Secretary Generals’ [[UNiTE to End Violence Against Women|UNiTE Campaign]]) and through existing coordination mechanisms, to support and promote national implementation of, monitor progress against, and advance the international normative framework. Regional institutions should similarly develop and implement coordinated workplans to support Member States implement regional normative frameworks for prevention of violence against women and girls, monitor progress against these frameworks, and advance the frameworks themselves. Such workplans might include strategies to:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand normative interpretations and understandings of prevention activity – beyond awareness-raising, education and sensitisation of the media – to make linkages with and encompass positive obligations on States to promote gender equality and change social norms contributing to gender stereotyping, discrimination and violence against women and girls, across all levels, jurisdictions, sectors and settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide policy guidance, technical advice and knowledge management to support States develop, implement and monitor holistic, systemic and sustained approaches to prevention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure coordinated and sustained national and regional programming for prevention across different agencies and funding streams, and in different settings, such as conflict-affected contexts, natural disasters, low, middle and high-income countries (e.g. through UNDAFs, humanitarian funding streams, and in cooperation with regional bodies).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure outcomes and targets for prevention of violence against women and girls are a key component of the post-2015 development agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 118''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 124(k) ‘Adopt all appropriate measures, especially in the field of education, to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, and to eliminate prejudices, customary practices and all other practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes and on stereotyped roles for men and women’,''' experts recommend that States:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor compulsory education promoting human rights and gender equality, challenging gender stereotypes, discrimination and violence against women and girls, and building skills for equal and respectful relationships and for peaceful conflict resolution, at all levels of schooling, from kindergarten to the tertiary level and in non-school educational settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review teaching and learning materials to support the above, elaborating relevant curricula and materials in partnership with specialists on violence against women and girls, and ensuring that such education is gender-sensitive, comprehensive and fully integrated and includes assessment and reporting measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide for specialized training and resources for teaching and support staff to deliver the above curricula, implement gender-sensitive approaches to instruction through non-violent pedagogy, and support students who may disclose violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support schools, tertiary institutions and other educational settings to promote broader ‘whole-school/institution cultures’ of equality, non-violence and respect, through engagement of leadership, events and extracurricular activities, and involvement of the community, as well as through policy and practice reform such as instigating institution-wide bans on all violence – including corporal punishment – and protocols and procedures for responding to violence, discrimination, bullying and harassment, whether in the staff-room, the classroom or elsewhere on the school/institution grounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor and support girls’ completion of secondary schooling which multiple studies suggest is strongly protective against domestic and sexual violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 119''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 126(a), calling for the development of ‘programmes and procedures to eliminate sexual harassment and other forms of violence against women in all educational institutions, workplaces and elsewhere,’''' experts make a number of recommendations to States, employers, trade unions, community and youth organisations and non-governmental organisations, as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review regulatory frameworks, codes of conduct, protocols and procedures, of workplace, educational institutions, sporting clubs, community and faith organisations, the military, police and other organisational/institutional environments, to ensure they work to eliminate discrimination and harassment, and build organisational environments that are safe and inclusive of women and girls, and encourage women’s and girls’ participation and leadership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foster collaboration between employer and other organisations, and with women’s and other civil society organisations – especially those with expertise in engaging men and boys for gender equality – to recognise the role of organisations/institutions in prevention of violence against women and girls. Such a role is not only limited to addressing violence, discrimination and harassment within the organisation itself, but also extends to the organisation/institution as a ‘change-maker,’ capable of contributing to the transformation of attitudes, practices and social norms in their communities and society as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and implement awareness-raising and bystander capacity-building initiatives for employees or other members of the organisation, especially those aimed at supporting men to proactively challenge men’s violence or early warning signs of such violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify women and men who can act as positive role models and ambassadors for prevention among employer and other organisations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure protection and regulation in both the private and public sector for migrant workers to help combat harassment, discrimination and trafficking incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 120''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 125(e) calling for the organisation, support and funding of ‘community-based education and training campaigns to raise awareness about violence against women as a violation of women's enjoyment of their human rights and mobilis[ation of] local communities to use appropriate gender-sensitive traditional and innovative methods of conflict resolution,’''' experts recommend that States, local authorities, civil society organisations, communities and community organisations, promote gender equal and non-violent relationships, families and communities through new and existing holistic prevention efforts, services, programmes, events and grant/funding initiatives; prioritise prevention of violence against women and girls in grassroots efforts, urban and municipal planning; and implement legislative, regulatory and community-based programming initiatives to prevent violence and harassment of women and girls in private and public spaces.

'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 125(f), recognising, supporting and promoting ‘the fundamental role of intermediate institutions, such as primary health-care centres, family-planning centres, existing school health services, mother and baby protection services, centres for migrant families and so forth in the field of information and education related to abuse’''' experts recommend that States and partner organisations:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor programmes combining respectful relationships skills building and counselling support for children and young people, especially those who have been exposed to, or are identified as at risk of, violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor intensive early-intervention programmes for children and young people demonstrating violence-supportive attitudes and/or who are using violence, recognising that this may be a result of prior victimisation and using a model that empowers them with the skills and inner resources for non-violent conflict resolution and healthy relationship-building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor positive and non-violent parenting programmes, including those specifically targeting fathers/men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate issues of gender equality and prevention of violence against women and girls into health and social welfare programmes including sexual, reproductive and maternal health, HIV-AIDS programmes, and programmes promoting equal, respectful and non-violent intimate and family relationships.&lt;/li&gt;

'''In line with''' '''[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325|UNSCR 1325]]''', experts recommend that States ensure they have and implement action plans on women, peace and security, including comprehensive strategies to address the proliferation of small arms and armed violence, whether in conflict, post - conflict or ‘peacetime’ settings. Such initiatives should specifically include:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The support of arms control and disarmament initiatives and policies that take into account the needs and perceptions of both men and women, namely through consultation and [[threat assessment]], and provide adequate incentives for participation, namely in regular campaigns of gun registry and civilian disarmament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The harmonisation and implementation of laws that address domestic violence and firearms and ammunition – banning individuals with a history of violence from access to firearms, and ensuring guns are seized and gun licences suspended in domestic violence cases. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The improvement of the police officers’ capacity to conduct psychosocial evaluations, along with strengthened police training on violence against women and girls and the role of firearms, reaching beyond those working in special victim units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conduction of risk analysis in all centres for victim support, including assessing the presence of a weapon in the home.&lt;/li&gt;

===Research on the cause and consequences of violence against women and girls and the effectiveness of prevention measures===
[[File:Hand glass.png|thumb|''Research on the causes and consequences of violence against women and girls and the effectiveness of prevention measures.''(Recommendations 126 to 133)]]
''Recommendation 126''&lt;br /&gt;''
There are also several areas of work that States have already committed to under the BPfA&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; Strategic Objective D2 – to study the causes and consequences of violence against women and the effectiveness of preventive measures – upon which immediate action can be taken. Below are recommendations elaborated by the experts in support of these existing commitments.

''Recommendation 127''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 129(a) calling on Governments, regional organisations, the United Nations, other international organisations, research institutions, women's and youth organisations and non-governmental organisations, as appropriate, to ‘promote research, collect data and compile statistics, especially concerning domestic violence, relating to the prevalence of different forms of violence against women, and encourage research into the causes, nature, seriousness and consequences of violence against women and the effectiveness of measures implemented to prevent and redress violence against women’,''' experts make several recommendations:

''Recommendation 128''&lt;br /&gt;''
States should ensure the systematic collection, disaggregation (by gender, age and other characteristics), analysis and dissemination and use of data, including through supporting civil society organisations, academics and other actors engaged in research, to inform policy and strategy development on prevention. National statistical agencies and relevant ministries such as those of health or justice, should apply internationally agreed upon technical and ethical standards, ensuring consistency of concepts, regularity of data collection, and wide and timely dissemination of data. Government’s national machineries for the advancement of women should be closely associated with such efforts. Collaboration between producers and users of data should be strengthened by having users involved in all stages of data collection and dissemination. Data collection on violence against women and girls should be age-disaggregated and carried out in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including advocates and agencies providing services to women and girls, policymakers, legislators and researchers. It is also necessary that data be collected in a way that respects confidentiality and the rights of research participants and does not jeopardize their safety.

''Recommendation 129''&lt;br /&gt;''
International and national institutions, in partnership with research organisations, academia, and other civil society groups, should work together to identify gaps and improve research and data collection to inform prevention work, particularly in the following areas:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documenting the prevalence and characteristics of all forms of violence against women and girls, including violence experienced by particular groups of women and girls (such as women with disabilities, indigenous women, or women affected by armed conflict and/or natural disasters, to name a few), with implications for prevention programming.
ext for first item here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying risk and protective factors (for both victimisation and perpetration) and causal pathways for all forms of violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 130''&lt;br /&gt;''
International and regional institutions, in partnership with research organisations and academia, should examine processes for identifying and establishing intergovernmental agreement on common indicators to measure progress on the prevention of violence against women and girls at the international, national and local levels should be developed. Such indicators should be appropriate to the context and include both impact indicators that measure the reduction in levels of violence as well as indicators that measure short and medium term progress, such as changes in social norms, or organisational and community practices.

''Recommendation 131''&lt;br /&gt;''
States, donors and international/regional institutions should provide for the regular and comprehensive evaluation of projects and programmes on prevention, with feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement. Evaluative data on the effectiveness of prevention strategies in low and middle income countries should be developed and utilized in order to facilitate the replication, scaling up and institutionalization of the most effective interventions. Evaluations should be sensitive to the long-term and complex nature of the social change required for prevention, seeking to measurer not only reductions in levels of violence (which will only be apparent in the longer-term), but also shorter term indicators of change such as the shifts in attitudes, norms and practices referred to above.
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluation should include a variety of methods including surveys, qualitative studies, administrative statistics/data and participatory approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods used should be appropriate to the context and scale of the interventions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where appropriate and feasible, longitudinal studies should be conducted to enable measurement of change over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluation should include also include measures of cost-effectiveness and feasibility of scaling up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 132''&lt;br /&gt;''
International and regional institutions, in partnership with research organisations and academia, should work together to develop practical tools and resources to support States and programmers in the elaboration, implementation and monitoring of prevention activity, for example:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Monitoring and evaluation]] tools that are practical and feasible for small-scale organisations and in low resource settings, including those affected by conflict and/or natural disasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-dimensional evaluation strategies capable of capturing the learnings and outcomes from holistic and multi-sectoral strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools for the collection and analysis of comparable statistical and qualitative data across countries relevant to prevention, building on existing methodologies such as the WHO Multi-country study, the ICRW and Instituto Promundo International Men and Gender Equality Survey and the P4P multi-country Change Project surveys, and research learnings emerging from the previous recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methodologies for cost-benefit analyses of prevention activity, covering not only the saving of longer-term reduced prevalence of violence itself, but also the mid-term social and economic benefits of increased institutional capacity, early intervention, increased gender equality, etc, and guidance for costing and financing prevention strategies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 133''&lt;br /&gt;''
International and regional institutions, civil society organisations, States and research institutions should support the development of ‘learning labs’ to produce new knowledge, design, test and share innovative approaches for the prevention of violence against women and girls. An international research and programming centre/institution for prevention might be envisaged to this end, providing guidance, tools and oversight for the activities described above, and potentially playing a role in the independent monitoring of the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Global Implementation Plan.]]

'''''Emerging evidence and practice have highlighted further issues for prevention of violence against women and girls only partially covered by the existing normative framework, and experts have identified specific areas of action responding to these (detailed under the sub-headings below).'''''

===Mass and new media===
{{See also|Sexualization (as a political term)}}
[[File:Computer-globe.png|thumb|''Mass and new media.'' (Recommendations 134 to 136)]]
''Recommendation 134''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 125(j) calling for awareness raising on ‘the responsibility of the media in promoting non-stereotyped images of women and men, as well as in eliminating patterns of media presentation that generate violence, and encourage those responsible for media content to establish professional guidelines and codes of conduct’ and on ‘the important role of the media in informing and educating people about the causes and effects of violence against women and in stimulating public debate on the topic,’''' experts recommend that States, including local governments, community organisations, non-governmental organisations, educational institutions, the public and private sectors, particularly enterprises, and the mass media, as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen regulatory frameworks with regard to media, advertising imagery, texts, games and other popular culture mediums which portray women or girls in a discriminatory, degrading or stereotypical way, or which glorify violent masculinities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage all media agencies that currently produce, or provide platforms for the distribution of, material/content which objectifies girls and women and/or which promote/distort messages around violence against girls and women, through a partnership approach, for example co-regulation. This includes the internet, mass media, music and games industries, and advertisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build partnerships with journalists and other media professionals for the prevention of violence against women and girls and the promotion of gender equality, such as through training, guidelines and awards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include dedicated resources in national media outlets for organisational and content development supporting gender equality and non-discrimination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support advocates such as victims/survivors of violence, men committed to non-violence, and high-profile people to respond to enquiries from journalists and speak at events on issues of violence against women and girls, and to promote messages of gender equality and non violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote inclusion and visibility of women at national conferences and in local and national media to challenge negative gender stereotypes and promote images of women leaders, intellectuals, politicians, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the media to educate, inform and engage citizens on women’s rights, in particular engaging women voters on women’s issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 135''&lt;br /&gt;''
In addition to the recommendations made in line with BPfA’s&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; Paragraph 125(j) above, wider and long term action is needed to address the role the media currently plays in contributing to, maintaining and reinforcing, gender stereotypes. Experts recommend that all stakeholders above take immediate interim action to provide children and young people with media literacy skills as a core aspect of school curricula. This should aim to build gender analysis skills to interrogate the status quo (i.e. the objectification of girls and women), critique constructions of gender roles and offer alternative interpretations and framings of the content that they are engaging with on a daily basis.

''Recommendation 136''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 129(d), encouraging ‘the media to examine the impact of gender role stereotypes, including those perpetuated by commercial advertisements which foster gender-based violence and inequalities, and how they are transmitted during the life cycle, and [to]take measures to eliminate these negative images with a view to promoting a violence-free society,’''' experts recommend that international/regional organisations, States, research institutions, civil society partners and media organisations, as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit to the research and development of urgently needed guidance (and where appropriate, regulatory action) for the prevention and prohibition of discrimination against women and girls and gender stereotyping across all media. This includes guidance on both the development and the distribution of material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully implement the Convention for the Rights of the Child (Article 17) which recognises the importance of mass media and calls on states to develop ‘appropriate guidelines for the protection of the child from information and material injurious to his or her well-being.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognise that media is an influential mechanism that can make a real difference to a larger project of preventing violence against women and girls. As such, work with media should not just be focussed on limiting harm, but should also be focussed on media making a positive difference e.g. responsible reporting of violence against women and girls which provides accurate information and a gendered analysis (i.e. one which interrogates dominant masculinities and recognises and challenges male privilege).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression as he considers issues of balancing the right to freedom of expression with the right to be protected from discrimination, with a view to contributing to and building on his recommendations to support prevention of violence against women and girls. Similarly, engage with the International Telecommunications Union as it considers the issue of internet regulation at its December 2012 conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===The global financial crisis and geo-politics===
[[File:TED Spread.png|thumb|''The global financial crisis and geo-politics.'' (Recommendations 137 to 139)]]
''Recommendation 137''&lt;br /&gt;
Given the likely negative impact of the global financial crisis on levels of violence against women and girls, and the subsequent economic, health and social costs of such increased violence (in terms of reduced productivity, strains on services, etc.), experts recommend that States, international and regional institutions, civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders, should proactively and collaboratively work to protect women’s and girls’ right to live free of violence, in order to ‘stem the tide’ of negative economic, health and social impacts arising from such violence and their subsequent further costs to the State.

''Recommendation 138''&lt;br /&gt;
International and regional organisations, donors, development agencies, philanthropics and other non-governmental organisations should ensure that allocations of aid funding in the wake of the crisis support programmes
to prevent (and respond to) violence against women and girls and promote women’s human rights.

''Recommendation 139''&lt;br /&gt;
International and regional institutions, civil society organisations and established donors should engage emerging middle income countries and new donors in the development of the new [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls]] and encourage a rights-based approach to aid investment that prioritises prevention of violence against women and girls through this international, target-focussed framework.

===Urban, serious youth (e.g. gang) and armed violence===
[[File:Gun outline.svg|thumb|''Urban, serious youth (e.g. gang) and armed violence.'' (Recommendation 140)]]
''Recommendation 140''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts recommend that States, non-governmental organisations, international/regional institutions and other stakeholders as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support investigations into the relationship between violence against women and girls and armed violence, especially thestrategies of gender-based violence used within and between rival armed groups and the use and threat of gender-based violence in the private sphere by members of armed groups, especially with guns. Research should also be undertaken on the link between intimate partner / domestic violence and armed violence, including the collection of data on the role of firearms in violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase collaboration between those working on violence against women and girls and those working on arms control at the local, national and international public policy levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor policies and programmes aimed at preventing and/or reducing armed violence specifically against girls and women locally and nationally that include gender-responsive protection measures in child and adolescent law and education systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor tailored strategies for girls and women who are involved in/associated with armed violence, and for girl children and adolescents at risk, with their active participation at all stages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen crime prevention policies to ensure a review of, and action on, the differential impact of urban violence on violence against women and girls, and by the same token, explicitly consider the impact of urban, serious youth (e.g. gang) or armed violence in policies or strategies for the prevention of violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in knowledge creation and data collection on the typologies and motivations of young men’s and women’s involvement in armed and violent criminality, especially in contexts with significant gun violence rates, as well as research on armed violence victims/survivors and witnesses, recognising that the decision to join gangs and other armed groups may be fuelled by social exclusion, family violence and violence experienced while in prison or at the hand of state security forces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support the strengthening of community policing initiatives, including specially trained officers with a focus on youth and family violence, violence against women and girls, and on human rights. Promote greater collaboration between police forces and other security sectors for community-based prevention efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate, strengthen and expand professional and vocational training programmes into socio-educational, juvenile justice and prison systems that are designed according to needs-based assessments, and including curricula on the gendered drivers and consequences of gun violence. Encourage and facilitate community reintegration approaches, including through supporting work with communities to prevent stigmatisation of youth who wish to reintegrate themselves into the community in a non-violent way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage urban young people in the development of public policies across key areas such as employment, revitalisation of marginalised neighbourhoods and housing, and cultural initiatives. Build the capacity of institutions and civil society organisations to harness the potential of young people to foster change, and position them as active protagonists in programme development, implementation and monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Humanitarian crises related to conflict and natural disasters===
[[File:CasaDestruidaFriburgo2011.jpg|thumb|''Humanitarian crises related to conflict and natural disasters''. (Recommendation 141)]]
''Recommendation 141''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts noted the lack of documented prevention strategies for settings affected by conflict and/or natural disasters, and the consequent improvised, small-scale, and/or issue-specific nature of prevention activities in these settings. They emphasised that it is critical that States – and the humanitarian, peacekeeping, civil society and development actors with whom they engage – institute broad, well-coordinated measures to prevent violence against women and girls in all stages of humanitarian intervention, and ensure that those measures incorporate strategies that reach the most vulnerable, as well as monitoring and evaluation components in order to develop an evidence base for good practice. To this end, experts recommend that States and their humanitarian partners:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate prevention into all contingency planning for humanitarian emergencies, and develop early warning systems to assess and avert the risk of violence against women and girls. Contingency planning and early warning strategies should engage women and girls in the affected communities in order to anticipate protection needs and develop, for example, community alert networks, safe spaces for women and girls, access to reproductive and sexual health care, widespread information about the illegality of violence against women and girls and the consequences for perpetrators. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a crisis strikes, immediately institute protections across all areas of humanitarian response, according to the IASC ''Guidelines for Gender-based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Settings''. Collect disaggregated data to identify the particular security needs of women and girls and develop targeted tools and guidelines to facilitate protection from and prevention of violence against women and girls, including protection from sexual exploitation and abuse committed by humanitarian actors against beneficiaries of humanitarian aid. Work with international and local human rights organisations to monitor the activities of armed groups to ensure that they adhere to the rules of combat, and are prohibited from, and held accountable for, violence against women and girls. All peacekeeping operations must act in accordance with the standards set forth in the UNSCRs on Women, Peace and Security.{{ref|K}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the initial emergency has passed and when working towards reconstruction, collaborate to expand prevention efforts and facilitate durable solutions for lasting peace and security. This includes incorporating prevention of violence against women and girls as an integral component of post-conflict and post-disaster action plans, including national action plans on Women, Peace and Security, and throughout all transition and recovery strategies. Ensure these action plans are multi-sectoral and supported by widespread protective legislation as well as capacity building across all key sectors to monitor and address risks for violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the reconstruction phase, undertake programming to build social and economic assets of women and girls in order to limit their future exposure to violence, through, for example, education, livelihoods, lifeskills, and leadership. Support women’s and girls’ empowerment in new and existing constitutions, bolstered by national mechanisms, government programs, and civil society partnerships, particularly women’s organisations addressing violence against women and girls. Identify and address risks related to perpetration of violence, particularly amongst boys who have been exposed to violence and in terms of limiting the availability of small arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In post-conflict settings, ensure the inclusion of women and girls in peace-building efforts at the national and local levels. Include elements addressing violence against women and girls committed during conflict in all peace agreements. Ensure that survivors have safe access to on-going care and treatment in all conflict-related transitional justice and reparations programmes. Include an emphasis on the special needs of women and girls who were part of fighting forces in programmes for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, and efforts to prevent future violence against women and girls, including by demobilised male soldiers. Work with families and communities to overcome prejudice and discrimination against women ex-combatants and women heads of household. Ensure an end to impunity by integrating prevention of (and response to) violence against women and girls into all security sector and justice reform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Girls, adolescent girls and young women===
[[File:Young girl applying cosmetics.jpg|thumb|''Girls, adolescent girls and young women.'' (Recommendation 142)]]
''Recommendation 142''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts recognised that girls, including adolescent girls, and young women are often excluded from, or ‘squeezed into,’ interventions which are focussed on adult women, on boys and young men, or on children in a gender-neutral way. Experts concluded that an emphasis on prevention work specifically tailored to the needs, experiences and aspirations of girls,
adolescent girls and young women is urgently needed; acknowledging the complexities of the current landscape that they are required to negotiate. Experts made the following recommendations to States, women’s and civil society organisations, international and regional institutions, public and private sectors, as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor tailored prevention activity with adolescent girls and young women that takes an empowerment, not protection, approach, and explicitly address their needs and rights, informed by the voices of adolescent girls and young women themselves. The onus is often placed on girls and young women to avoid / stop violence from happening to them rather than on developing widespread and embedded activities which challenge the social norms that permeate their lives. Prevention programmes should therefore address what is happening around young people (e.g. social pressures, media messaging and so forth) rather than purely on helping young women to ‘manage’ their adolescence (and the risks of violence this is assumed to entail) more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support all adolescents and young people to understand the nature of consent and coercion, and the impact of social and environmental factors on individual ability to truly provide consent (e.g. with key messages such as ''‘your '''yes''' is only as good as your ability to say '''no'''''’). The issue of consent, and especially sexual consent, is complex and is widely misunderstood among many adults. Yet adolescent girls and young women are often expected to be able to negotiate this difficult terrain which is focussed exclusively on the nature of a ‘no’ rather than the expectation that what is required is a strong, enthusiastic ‘yes’. This in turn reinforces notions of female passivity (the object of pursuit) and male aggressor (the pursuer). Such activities would have relevance to a number of areas from teen relationships to forced marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure a gender dimension is incorporated into multi-sectoral legislative, policy and programmatic development to prevent (and respond to) violence against children, taking into account the specific needs, vulnerabilities and voices of girls of all ages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the ill health, including the practice in the 1960s and 1970s of offering young, skilled workers in Glasgow social housing in [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]], leaving behind a demographically "unbalanced population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walsh|first1=David|last2=McCartney|first2=Gerry|last3=Collins|first3=Chik|last4=Taulbut|first4=Martin|last5=Batty|first5=G.

==Excess mortality and morbidity==
[[File:Red Road flats at Balornock - geograph.org.uk - 119968.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Red Road Flats]] in [[Springburn]] were demolished in October 2015.]]
The city's mortality gap was not apparent until 1950 and seems to have widened since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Walsh2010/&gt; ''The Economist'' wrote in 2012: "It is as if a [[miasma theory|malign vapour]] rises from the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] at night and settles in the lungs of sleeping Glaswegians."&lt;ref name=Economist2012&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21560888 "Unhealthy Glaswegians: No city for old men"], ''The Economist'', 25 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mortality rates are the highest in the UK and among the highest in Europe. As of 2016, [[life expectancy]] in Scotland was lower for both females and males than anywhere else in western Europe, and was not improving as quickly as in other western European countries.{{sfn|Walsh|McCartney|Collins|Taulbut|2016|p=24}} With a population of 1.2 million in greater Glasgow, life expectancy at birth is 71.6 years for men, nearly seven years below the national average of 78.2 years, and 78 years for women, over four years below the national average of 82.3.&lt;ref name=Muriel2012&gt;Muriel, Ali (6 November 2012).

According to the [[World Health Organization]] in 2008, the male [[life expectancy at birth]] in the [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]] area of Glasgow at that time was 54 years.{{efn|This was based on "pooled data 1998-2002 (Hanlon, Walsh &amp; Whyte, 2006)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Closing the gap in a generation: health equity through action on the social  determinants of health.

The 2008–2012 estimate for Calton and nearby [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]] together, by then more ethnically diverse and with fewer hostels, was 67.8 years for males and 76.6 years for females.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Bruce (2 June 2015).

The Glasgow Centre for Population Health (GCPH) was established in 2004 to study the causes of Glasgow's ill health; the centre's partners are [[NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde]], [[Glasgow City Council]] and the [[University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;Tannahill, Carol (27 October 2004).

Glasgow Centre for Population Health. p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; In a publication introducing the GCPH, the [[Chief Medical Officer for Scotland]], [[Harry Burns (doctor)|Harry Burns]], referred to research suggesting that chronically activated stress responses, especially in children, affect the structure of parts of the frontal lobes of the brain, and that these determine the physical reaction to stress, which could result in chronic ill health. The ability to attain good health, he suggested, depends in part on whether people feel in control of their lives, and whether they see their environments as threatening or supportive.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Harry (27 October 2004).

[[File:Grand Canyon North Rim Campground Registration Office 0097.jpg|thumb|Golden Age Passport gives 50% discount camping at Federal Parks]]
'''''Golden Age Passport''''' was a pass issued by the [[National Park Service]] until January 1, 2007. It has been replaced with the '''''Senior Pass''''' of the new pass series now called '''America the Beautiful – National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass,''' created by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act and authorized by Congress in December 2004.&lt;ref name="legislation"&gt;[http://nationalparksreport.com/General_Information_for_national_parks/Entrance_fees_and_passes.html Authorizing Legislation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm America the Beautiful - National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;[http://store.usgs.gov/pass/general.html National Park Service - Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="changes"&gt; [http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Discounts/2007/7-07-27-SenDiscounts2NatParks.htm Senior Discounts to National Parks Have Changed]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senior Pass is a lifetime entrance pass to United States [[List of areas in the United States National Park System|national park]]s for those 62 years and older.&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt;  To obtain this a [[senior citizen]] need only go to any National Park Service facility that charges an entrance fee with the following: 

* Proof of age (must be 62 years or older).&lt;ref name ="how"&gt;[http://usparks.about.com/library/howto/htgoldenage.htm How to Obtain a Golden Age Passport]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Proof of citizenship (must be citizen or permanent resident of the United States)&lt;ref name ="how"/&gt;
* Eighty Dollars (the one-time processing fee as of August 28, 2017). '''NOTE: A new $20 annual Senior Pass became available on August 28, 2017.''' &lt;ref name="nps"/&gt; 

The pass is also available for $90 by mail from the US Geological Survey (extra $10 is for postage and handling).&lt;ref&gt; [http://store.usgs.gov/pass/senior.html Ten Dollar Postage/Handling by mail] &lt;/ref&gt; 

Some consider this one of the best travel bargains in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epinions.com/trvl-review-3056-14A272E-38948AB1-prod2 Golden Age Passport (National Parks)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Travel/03-26-01NatParks.htm Seniors (62 and over) Can Get Free Pass to National Parks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/25/AR2006112500053.html Sometimes Age Is a Bargain - 62 or Older?

==Conditions==

The National Park Service words the '''''Senior Pass''''' on their website as: 

''This is a lifetime pass for U.S. citizens or permanent residents age 62 or over. Valid at Federal recreation entrance or standard amenity fee sites for: pass holder and occupants of single, private, non-commercial vehicle OR one motorcycle; OR pass holder and three persons (16 and older) where per person fees are charged. The pass can only be obtained in person at the park. The Senior Pass provides a 50 percent discount on some Expanded Amenity Fees charged for facilities and services such as camping, swimming, boat launch, and specialized interpretive services. In some cases where Expanded Amenity Fees are charged, only the pass holder will be given the 50 percent price reduction. The pass is non-transferable and generally does NOT cover or reduce special recreation permit fees or fees charged by concessionaires.''&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt;

The now obsolete Golden Age Passport worked in a similar manner as the Senior Pass with the exception that the accompanying persons needed to be spouse and/or children of the cardholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/passespermits/goldens.shtml |title=Recreation Fees and Passes |publisher=US Forest Service |accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series==

There are similar passes within this series:

* '''Annual Pass''' – a 12-month period pass, $80 as of January 1, 2008, increased from $50 of previous years.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="changes"/&gt;  
* '''[[Access Pass]]''' – a lifetime pass for U.S. citizens or permanent residents with permanent disabilities.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fees"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm America the Beautiful - National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass fees]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Volunteer Pass''' – an annual pass for volunteers acquiring 250 service hours labor.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fees"/&gt;

The current fees for these should be verified at the National Park Service website which will also provide additional answers to frequently asked questions.&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; 

Participating agencies included in the pass series are the [[National Park Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (Forest Service), [[Fish and Wildlife Service]], [[Bureau of Land Management]] and [[Bureau of Reclamation]].&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt;  Some [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] and [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] sites may honor the '''Senior Pass''' and the '''Access Pass''' for camping discounts.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;

==Family Background and Early life==
Hans Nieper was born in Hanover, Germany on May 23, 1928. His parents - who were both physicians - were Ferdinand Nieper (b. 1887) and Margarete Krauss (b.1898).&lt;ref&gt;Her full name was Margarete Friederike Anne Viktoria Krauss.&lt;/ref&gt;{{RS|date=October 2017}} They were married in 1925. Shortly after getting married, Hans' parents began working at the Wahrendorff Psychiatric Hospital (now known as [[:de:Klinikum Wahrendorff]]) at Sehnde-Ilten, near Hanover.&lt;ref name=life /&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2017}}

Hans' fascination with science and medicine came long before he was a physician. Coming from a family with an extensive background in medicine, Hans  eventually followed in the family footsteps and became a physician himself.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite book |last1= Nieper |first1= H. |last2= Alexander |first2= A. |date= 1999 |title= The Curious Man: The Life and Works of Dr. Hans Nieper |location= Garden City Park, N.Y. |publisher= Avery}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2017}}

Hans' father Ferdinand Nieper was a son of Herbert Nieper (1848-1939),&lt;ref&gt;His full name was Herbert Otto Wilhelm August Nieper (1848 - May 23, 1939).&lt;/ref&gt;{{RS|date=October 2017}} who was the Chief Surgeon at the hospital in [[Goslar]], which was renamed the Dr.-Herbert-Nieper-Krankenhaus&lt;ref&gt;The Dr.-Herbert-Nieper-Krankenhaus is now a privately-owned hospital of the Asklepios Harzkliniken group, serving the greater Harz region.&lt;/ref&gt; in his honor. In 1879 Hans' grandfather Dr. Herbert Nieper married Karla Marie Johanne Elisabeth Wahrendorff (b. August 21, 1859), who was a daughter of Ferdinand Wahrendorff (1826-1898),&lt;ref&gt;His full name was August Ernst Ferdinand Leonhard Theodor Wahrendorff (February 20, 1826 - March 21, 1898). On October 5, 1854 he married Friederike Amalie Juliane Charlotte Sophie von Jeinsen (1826 - May 13, 1898).&lt;/ref&gt;{{RS|date=October 2017}} founder of the Wahrendorff Psychiatric Hospital.

As a child and adolescent, Hans spent most of his time at the Wahrendorff Psychiatric Hospital. His parents granted him complete intellectual freedom. As he matured, Hans' parents encouraged him to participate in stimulating conversations about the nature of the mind, the relationship between biology and mentality, and the validity of orthodox medicine, and to ask questions and raise points on his own. These experiences in Hans' early years taught him to think analytically, to question orthodox assumptions, and to explore ideas and thoughts without fear of censure or ridicule.&lt;ref name=life /&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2017}}

==Career and Discoveries==
Hans Nieper was educated at the [[University of Mainz|Johann Gutenberg University]] and the [[University of Freiberg]] before earning his [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] at the [[University of Hamburg]]. During his career, he served as Director of the Department of Medicine at the Paracelsus-Klinik am Silbersee (Paracelsus Silbersee Hospital) in [[Hanover]]-[[Langenhagen]], and as Director of the German Society for Medical Tumour Treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Fear Cancer No More: Preventive and Healing Information Everyone Should Know | last = Emeka | first = Mauris L. | publisher = Health Research Books | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-9640125-6-1 |page = 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nieper was among the first researchers to work with [[lithium orotate]].&lt;ref name="Lerner"/&gt; Nieper and biochemist Dr. Franz Josef Köhler (1909-1984)&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Franz Josef Köhler (October 2, 1909 - September 22, 1984) was a German biochemist and inventor.

He founded this company in 1959 in Alsbach-Hahnlein, DE, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koehler-chemie.de/deutsch/wir/franz-j.koehler-preis/franz-j.-koehler-preis-franz-josef-koehler.html  Biography of Dr. Franz Josef Köhler (1909-1984), and History of Dr. Franz Köhler Chemie GmbH]&lt;/ref&gt; patented Calcium AEP ([[Calcium 2-aminoethylphosphate]]), which they believed could be helpful in combating such diseases as [[juvenile diabetes]], [[gastritis]], [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]], [[thyroiditis]], [[Myocarditis]] and [[Hodgkin's Disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Best of Health: The 100 Best Health Books | first = Sheldon | last = Zerden |author2=Richard Passwater |author3=Abram Hoffer  | publisher = Warren H.

The '''Health Data Consortium''' ('''HDC''') is a Washington, D.C.-based [[public-private partnership]] that advocates for the [[Open data|availability]] and use of health data, in particular [[Open government|government health datasets]], and the improvement of [[health]] and [[health care]] through [[Personal health record|patient data accessibility]] and [[Disruptive innovation|innovative use]] of data. HDC is a [[501(c)(3)]] organization.

==History==
In 2010, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] launched the Health Data Initiative to make its data available for public use&lt;ref&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/CHDI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthdata.gov/blog/health-data-initiative-strategy-execution-plan-released-and-ready-feedback&lt;/ref&gt; and, in collaboration with the [[Institute of Medicine]], hosted a [[public forum]] featuring various private, non-profit, and entrepreneurial stakeholder groups to explore how the data could be used to promote innovation that would improve people's health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iom.edu/Activities/PublicHealth/HealthData.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This forum was held again in 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iom.edu/Activities/PublicHealth/HealthData/2011-JUN-09.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and 2012, wherein it was rebranded into its current iteration as the Health Datapalooza.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iom.edu/Activities/PublicHealth/HealthData/2012-JUN-05.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://healthdatapalooza.org/about/history-of-health-datapalooza/&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the success of the forum and growing industry interest, [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]], the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]], the [[California HealthCare Foundation]], and other parties involved believed that there needed to be a structured organization independent of the government that could convene stakeholder groups and promote the health data mission year-round. They approached [http://forumone.com Forum One Communications] to help establish this organization as a public-private partnership, which was named the Health Data Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;http://forumone.com/insights/launching-the-health-data-consortium-two-years-later/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
In February 2013, Dwayne Spradlin was announced as acting CEO of HDC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthdataconsortium.org/article_content.asp?article=12&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Dr. Christopher Boone, who was appointed Executive Director in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthdataconsortium.org/article_content.asp?article=28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Health Datapalooza===
The Health Datapalooza conference continues the work of the Health Data Initiative Forum by convening stakeholders annually. In particular, Health Datapalooza is known for highlighting health care [[Startup company|startups]] that use health data to develop [[Computer program|programs]] and [[Mobile app|applications]] by way of a [[Competitive programming|coding challenge]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/06/16/321682150/power-to-the-health-data-geeks&lt;/ref&gt; or through demos of the applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govhealthit.com/news/todd-park-hhs-aims-be-noaa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/06/07/189565146/datapalooza-a-concept-a-conference-and-a-movement&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health Data All Stars===
The Health Data All Stars is a directory of organizations and websites that offer [[Open data|open health datasets]] for public viewing and use.&lt;ref&gt;http://allstars.healthdataconsortium.org/resources/health-data-all-stars/about-all-stars&lt;/ref&gt; The directory currently features over fifty open health data entries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3269">For the period between 2005 and 2010, El Salvador had the third lowest [[List of countries by birth rate|birth rate]] in Central America, with 22.8 births per 1,000. However, during the same period, it had the highest [[List of countries by death rate|death rate]] in Central America, 5.9 deaths per 1,000. In 2015 life expectancy for men was 67.8 years and 77.0 years for women. Healthy life expectancy was 57 for males and 62 for females in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/countries/slv/en/|title=El Salvador|publisher=Who.int|date=2009-03-30|accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was considerable improvement in socioeconomic and health status from 1990 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Country Report: El Salvador |url=https://www.paho.org/salud-en-las-americas-2017/?page_id=119 |accessdate=18 November 2018 |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s there was widespread malnutrition. Sewage systems were rare in rural areas even in the 1980s.  There were high rates of infant mortality, malaria and water-borne diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Haggarty |first1=Richard |title=El Salvador: A Country Study |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/30.htm |accessdate=18 November 2018 |publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healthcare==
The public healthcare system consists of 
*Ministry of Health which provides free health services to 79.5% of the population
*[[Salvadoran Institute for Social Security]], which provides health insurance for 18.4% of the population
*Teacher’s Welfare
*Military Health
*[[Higher Council for Public Health]]
*[[Salvadoran Institute for the Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons]]

In 1984 there were ten general hospitals and twelve health centers in the country.  The Medical School of the National University was closed in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Haggarty |first1=Richard |title=El Salvador: A Country Study |url=http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/30.htm |accessdate=18 November 2018 |publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now 30 public hospitals in El Salvador, plus various primary care facilities and 27 basic health care systems.  Before 2009 a “voluntary” donation was demanded for access to a public hospital or clinic.  Clinics staffed by Community Health Teams have been established in the rural areas.  Although services are supposed to be free shortage of funds means that people may have to pay for supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bloom |first1=Amanda |title=Universal Health Care in El Salvador – A Personal Reflection |url=http://www.globalhealthcheck.org/?p=1318 |accessdate=18 November 2018 |publisher=Global Healthcheck |date=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Emergency services are very basic.

The private health sector offers care in medical facilities concentrated in urban areas.

==Historical conceptions of abnormal behavior==

Explanations of abnormal behavior derive from theories or models popular at the time. Three major models, namely, supernatural model, biological model and psychological model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abnormal Psychology An Integrative Approach seventh edition|last=|first=|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=|location=Patparganj, Delhi, India|pages=6, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supernatural tradition===

For much of our recorded history, deviant behavior has been considered a reflection of the battle between good and evil. When confronted with unexplainable, irrational behavior and by suffering and upheaval, people have perceived evil. In fact, in the Great Persian Empire from 900 to 600 B.C., all physical and mental disorders were considered the work of the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abnormal Psychology An Integrative Approach seventh edition|last=|first=|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=|location=Patparganj, Delhi, India|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological tradition===

Physical causes of mental disorders have been sought in history. Important to this tradition are a man, Hippocrates; a disease, syphilis; and the early consequences of believing that psychological disorders are biologically caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abnormal Psychology An Integrative Approach seventh edition|last=|first=|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=|location=Patparganj, Delhi, India|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological tradition===

This was a precursor to modern psychosocial treatment approaches to the causation of psychopathology, with the focus on psychological, social and cultural factors. Well known philosophers like Aristotle, Plato, etc., wrote about the importance of fantasies, dreams, cognitions, and thus anticipated, to some extent, later developments in psychoanalytic thought and cognitive science. They also advocated humane and responsible care for individuals with psychological disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abnormal Psychology An Integrative Approach seventh edition|last=|first=|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=|location=Patparganj, Delhi, India|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient period==
===Mesopotamia===
Mental illnesses were well known in ancient [[Mesopotamia]],&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nemet-Nejat|first=Karen Rhea|authorlink=Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat|date=1998|title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lbmXsaTGNKUC&amp;pg=PA81|location=Santa Barbara, California|publisher=Greenwood|series=Daily Life|isbn=978-0313294976|pages=80–81|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; where diseases and mental disorders were believed to be caused by specific deities.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Jeremy|first2=Anthony|last2=Green|title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/?id=05LXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Inana|publisher=The British Museum Press|year=1992|isbn=0-7141-1705-6|pages=102|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[hand]]s symbolized control over a person, mental illnesses were known as "hands" of certain deities.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; One psychological illness was known as ''Qāt Ištar'', meaning "Hand of [[Ishtar]]".&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Others were known as "Hand of [[Shamash]]", "Hand of the Ghost", and "Hand of the God".&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Descriptions of these illnesses, however, are so vague that it is usually impossible to determine which illnesses they correspond to in modern terminology.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Mesopotamian doctors kept detailed record of their patients' [[hallucination]]s and assigned spiritual meanings to them.&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"/&gt; A patient who hallucinated that he was seeing a dog was predicted to die;&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"/&gt; whereas, if he saw a gazelle, he would recover.&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"/&gt; The royal family of [[Elam]] was notorious for its members frequently suffering from insanity.&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"/&gt; [[Erectile dysfunction]] was recognized as being rooted in psychological problems.&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"/&gt;

===Egypt===
Limited notes in an [[ancient Egypt]]ian document known as the [[Ebers papyrus]] appear to describe the affected states of [[concentration]], [[attention]], and emotional distress in the heart or mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yuhas|first=Daisy|title=Throughout History, Defining Schizophrenia Has Remained A Challenge (Timeline)|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=throughout-history-defining-schizophrenia-has-remained-challenge|publisher=Scientific American Mind |date=March 2013|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these were interpreted later, and renamed as [[hysteria]] and [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]. Somatic treatments included applying bodily fluids while reciting [[spell (paranormal)|magical spells]]. [[Hallucinogens]] may have been used as a part of the healing rituals. Religious temples may have been used as therapeutic [[retreat (spiritual)|retreats]], possibly for the induction of receptive states to facilitate sleep and the interpretation of [[dream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nasser | first1=Mervat | title=Psychiatry in Ancient Egypt | url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/11/12/420.pdf | journal=Bulletin of the Royal College of Psychiatrists | volume=11 | pages=420–422 | date=December 1987 | doi = 10.1192/pb.11.12.420 |doi-access=free | issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{One source|section|date=December 2016}}
Ancient [[Hindu]] scriptures-[[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]-contain fictional descriptions of depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David H. Rosmarin|author2=Harold G. Koenig|title=Handbook of Religion and Mental Health|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=504GYYj1O3kC|year=1998|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-053371-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental disorders were generally thought to reflect abstract metaphysical entities, supernatural agents, sorcery and witchcraft. The [[Charaka Samhita]] from circa 600 BC, which is a part of the Hindu [[Ayurveda]] ("knowledge of life"), saw ill health as resulting from an imbalance among the three body fluids or forces called Tri-[[Tridosha|Dosha]]. These also affected the personality types among people. Suggested causes included inappropriate diet, disrespect towards the gods, teachers or others, mental shock due to excessive fear or joy, and faulty bodily activity. Treatments included the use of herbs and ointments, charms and prayers, and moral or emotional persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhugra | first1 = Dinesh | date =June 1992 | title = Psychiatry in ancient Indian texts: a review |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0957154X9200301002 |format=pdf | journal = History of Psychiatry | pmid = 11623029 | volume = 3 | issue = 10| pages = 167–186 | doi = 10.1177/0957154X9200301002 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
The earliest known record of mental illness in ancient China dates back to 1100 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese Culture and Mental Health|last=|first=|publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|year=1985|isbn=|location=Orlando, Florida|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental disorders were treated mainly under [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] using herbs, [[acupuncture]] or "emotional therapy". The [[Huangdi Neijing|Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor]] described symptoms, mechanisms and therapies for mental illness, emphasizing connections between bodily organs and emotions. The ancient Chinese believed that demonic possession played a role in mental illness during this time period. They felt that areas of emotional outbursts such as funeral homes could open up the Wei Chi and allow entities to possess an individual. Trauma was also considered to be something that caused high levels of emotion. Thus, trauma is a possible catalyst for mental illness, due to its ability to allow the Wei Chi open to possession. This explains why the ancient Chinese believed that a mental illness was in reality a demonic possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cibik|first=Ted|date=|title=Possession and Mental Illness from a Chinese Health Care Perspective|url=|journal=Oriental Medicine|volume=|pages=30–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chinese thought, [[Wu Xing|five stages or elements]] comprised the conditions of imbalance between [[Yin and yang]]. Mental illness, according to the Chinese perspective is thus considered as an imbalance of the yin and yang because optimum health arises from balance with nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lam, Chow., Tsang, Hector., Corrigan, Patrick.,|first=Lee, Yueh-Ting., Angell, Beth.; et al.|date=January–March 2010|title=Chinese Lay Theory and Mental Illness Stigma: Implications for Research and Practices|url=|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation|volume=76.1|pages=35–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China was one of the earliest developed civilizations in which medicine and attention to mental disorders were introduced (Soong, 2006)As in the West, Chinese views of mental disorders regressed to a belief in supernatural forces as causal agents. From the later part of the second century through the early part of the ninth century, ghosts and devils were implicated in “ghostevil” insanity, which presumably resulted from possession by evil spirits. The “Dark Ages” in China, however, were neither so severe (in terms of the treatment of mental patients) nor as long-lasting as in the West. A return to biological, somatic (bodily) views and an emphasis on psychosocial factors occurred in the centuries that followed. Over the past 50 years, China has been experiencing a broadening of ideas in mental health services and has been incorporating many ideas from Western psychiatry (Zhang &amp; Lu, 2006) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abnormal Psychology 15th Edition|last=|first=|publisher=Pearson|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=33, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece and Rome===
{{main|Mental illness in ancient Greece}}
In ancient Greece and Rome, madness was associated stereotypically with aimless wandering and violence. However, [[Socrates]] considered positive aspects including prophesying (a 'manic art'); mystical initiations and rituals; poetic inspiration; and the madness of lovers. Now often seen as the very epitome of rational thought and as the founder of philosophy, Socrates freely admitted to experiencing what are now called "command [[hallucinations]]" (then called his 'daemon').

Through long contact with Greek culture, and their eventual conquest of Greece, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] absorbed many Greek (and other) ideas on medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Staden |first=Heinrich |chapter=Liminal Perils: Early Roman Receptions of Greek Medicine |title=Tradition, Transmission, Transformation: Proceedings of two Conferences on Pre-Modern Science Held at the University of Oklahoma |series=International Academy for the History of Science |volume=37 |editor1-first=F.

The Greek physician [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]] (ca. 124–40 BC), who practiced in Rome, discarded it and advocated humane treatments, and had insane persons freed from confinement and treated them with natural therapy, such as diet and massages. [[Arateus]] (ca. AD 30–90) argued that it is hard to pinpoint from where a mental illness comes. However, [[Galen]] (AD 129–ca. 200), practicing in Greece and Rome, revived humoral theory.&lt;ref name="Davison2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1383/psyt.2006.5.4.115 |last=Davison |first=Kenneth |date=April 2006 |title=Historical aspects of mood disorders |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1476179306700246 |url-access=subscription |journal=Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=115–118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen, however, adopted a single symptom approach rather than broad diagnostic categories, for example studying separate states of sadness, excitement, confusion and memory loss.&lt;ref name="Pilgrim2007"/&gt;

Playwrights such as [[Homer]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] described madmen driven insane by the gods, imbalanced humors or circumstances. As well as the triad (of which mania was often used as an overarching term for insanity) there were a variable and overlapping range of terms for such things as delusion, eccentricity, frenzy, and lunacy. Physician [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] argued that insanity is really present when a continuous dementia begins due to the mind being at the mercy of imaginings. He suggested that people must heal their own souls through philosophy and personal strength. He described common practices of [[dietetics]], bloodletting, drugs, talking therapy, [[incubation (ritual)|incubation]] in temples, [[exorcism]], [[incantations]] and [[amulets]], as well as restraints and "tortures" to restore rationality, including starvation, being terrified suddenly, agitation of the spirit, and [[stoning]] and beating. Most, however, did not receive medical treatment but stayed with family or wandered the streets, vulnerable to assault and derision. Accounts of delusions from the time included people who thought themselves to be famous actors or speakers, animals, inanimate objects, or one of the gods. Some were arrested for political reasons, such as [[Jesus ben Ananias]] who was eventually released as a madman after showing no concern for his own fate during torture.

===Israel and the Hebrew diaspora===
Passages of the [[Hebrew Bible]]/[[Old Testament]] have been interpreted as describing mood disorders in figures such as [[Job (Bible)|Job]], [[King Saul]] and in the [[Psalms of David]].&lt;ref name="Davison2006"/&gt; In the [[Book of Daniel]], [[Nebuchadnezzar II|King Nebuchadnezzar]] is described as temporarily losing his sanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Daniel|4:25-4:34|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental disorder was not a problem like any other, caused by one of the gods, but rather caused by problems in the relationship between the individual and God.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} They believed that abnormal behavior was the result of possessions that represented the wrath and punishment from God.

==Middle ages==

===Persia, Arabia and the Muslim empire===
[[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Arabs|Arabic]] scholars were heavily involved in translating, analyzing and synthesizing Greek texts and concepts. As the [[Muslim world]] expanded, Greek concepts were integrated with religious thought and over time, new ideas and concepts were developed. Arab texts from this period contain discussions of melancholia, mania, hallucinations, delusions, and other mental disorders. Mental disorder was generally connected to loss of reason, and writings covered links between the brain and disorders, and spiritual/mystical meaning of disorders.&lt;ref name=Dening1996&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0957154X9600702503 |doi-access=free |last1=Youssef |first1=Hanafy A. |last2=Youssef |first2=Fatma A. |editor-last=Dening |editor-first=T.R. |date=March 1996 |title=Evidence for the existence of schizophrenia in medieval Islamic society |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0957154X9600702503 |format=pdf |journal=History of Psychiatry |volume=7 |issue=25 |pages=55–62 | pmid=11609215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote about fear and anxiety, anger and aggression, sadness and depression, and obsessions.

Some thought mental disorder could be caused by possession by a [[djinn]] (genie), which could be either good or demon-like. There were sometimes beatings to exorcise the djin, or alternatively over-zealous attempts at cures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/321622.stm |title=Religion tackles mental illness |work=BBC News |location=London |date=17 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic views often merged with local traditions. In [[Morocco]] the traditional [[Berber people]] were [[animists]] and the concept of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] was integral to the understanding of mental disorder; it was mixed with the Islamic concepts of djin and often treated by religious scholars combining the roles of [[Islam|holy man]], [[Wise old man|sage]], [[wikt:seer|seer]] and [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stein |first1=Debra |date=28 November 2000 |title=Views of mental illness in Morocco: Western medicine meets the traditional symbolic |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |pmid=11192655 |volume=163 |issue=11 |pages=1468–1470 |pmc=80417 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/163/11/1468.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian Europe===
Conceptions of madness in the Middle Ages in Europe were a mixture of the [[divinity|divine]], [[devil|diabolical]], [[magical (paranormal)|magical]] and [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]]. Theories of the [[humorism|four humors]] (black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood) were applied, sometimes separately (a matter of "physic") and sometimes combined with theories of evil spirits (a matter of "faith"). [[Arnaldus de Villanova]] (1235–1313) combined "evil spirit" and Galen-oriented "four humours" theories and promoted [[trephining]] as a cure to let demons and excess humours escape. Other bodily remedies in general use included [[purges]], [[bloodletting]] and [[Flagellation|whipping]]. Madness was often seen as a moral issue, either a punishment for sin or a test of faith and character. Christian theology endorsed various therapies, including fasting and prayer for those estranged from God and [[exorcism]] of those possessed by the devil.&lt;ref name="Laffey2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0033291703008109 |last=Laffey |first=Paul |title=Psychiatric therapy in Georgian Britain |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=1285–97 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14580082 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although mental disorder was often thought to be due to [[sin]], other more mundane causes were also explored, including intemperate diet and alcohol, overwork, and grief.&lt;ref name=Kroll&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0033291700015105 |last1=Kroll |first1=Jerome |last2=Bachrach |first2=Bernard |date=August 1984 |title=Sin and mental illness in the Middle Ages |url= |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=507–514 |pmid=6387755 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Franciscan monk [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]] (ca. 1203&amp;nbsp;– 1272) described a condition which resembles depression in his encyclopedia, ''De Proprietatibis Rerum'', and he suggested that music would help.

The care of lunatics was primarily the responsibility of the family. In [[Kingdom of England|England]], if the family were unable or unwilling, an assessment was made by [[The Crown|crown]] representatives in consultation with a local jury and all interested parties, including the subject himself or herself. The process was confined to those with real estate or [[personal estate]], but it encompassed poor as well as rich and took into account psychological and social issues. Most of those considered lunatics at the time probably had more support and involvement from the community than people diagnosed with mental disorders today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roffe |first1=David |last2=Roffe |first2=Christine |date=23 December 1995 |title=Madness and care in the community: a medieval perspective |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/311/7021/1708 |url-access=subscription |journal=BMJ |volume=311 |issue=7021 |pages=1708–1712 |pmid=8541770 |pmc=2539103 |doi=10.1136/bmj.311.7021.1708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other eras, visions were generally interpreted as meaningful [[vision (spirituality)|spiritual]] and [[visionary]] insights; some may have been causally related to mental disorders, but since [[hallucinations]] were culturally supported they may not have had the same connections as today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00005053-198201000-00007 |last1=Kroll |first1=Jerome |last2=Bachrach |first2=Bernard |title=Visions and psychopathology in the Middle Ages |journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=170 |issue=1 |pages=41–9 |date=January 1982 |pmid=7033474 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mentally disturbed people may have been victims of the [[witch-hunts]] that spread in waves in [[early modern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/1520-6696(197710)13:4&lt;337::AID-JHBS2300130406&gt;3.0.CO;2-G |last=Schoeneman |first=Thomas J. |title=The role of mental illness in the European witch hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: an assessment |journal=Journal of the history of the behavioral sciences |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–51 |date=October 1977 |pmid=336681 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those judged insane were increasingly admitted to local [[workhouses]], [[poorhouses]] and jails (particularly the "[[pauper]] insane") or sometimes to the new private madhouses.&lt;ref name="Wright1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=David |title=Getting out of the asylum: understanding the confinement of the insane in the nineteenth century |journal=Social History of Medicine |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=137–55 |date=April 1997 |pmid=11619188 |doi=10.1093/shm/10.1.137 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Restraints and forcible confinement were used for those thought dangerously disturbed or potentially violent to themselves, others or property.&lt;ref name="Laffey2003"/&gt; The latter likely grew out of lodging arrangements for single individuals (who, in workhouses, were considered disruptive or ungovernable) then there were a few catering each for only a handful of people, then they gradually expanded (e.g. 16 in London in 1774, and 40 by 1819). By the mid-19th century there would be 100 to 500 inmates in each. The development of this network of madhouses has been linked to new capitalist social relations and a service economy, that meant [[families]] were no longer able or willing to look after disturbed relatives.&lt;ref name="Crossley2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crossley |first=Nick |date=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RuGQSN6sBA8C |url-access=limited |title=Contesting Psychiatry: Social Movements in Mental Health |chapter=Contextualizing contention: a potted history of the mental health field |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RuGQSN6sBA8C&amp;pg=PA47 |pages=47–68 |series=Critical studies in health and society |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-35417-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 17th century and into the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], madness was increasingly seen as an organic physical phenomenon, no longer involving the soul or moral responsibility. The mentally ill were typically viewed as insensitive wild animals. Harsh treatment and restraint in chains was seen as therapeutic, helping suppress the animal passions. There was sometimes a focus on the management of the environment of madhouses, from diet to exercise regimes to number of visitors. Severe somatic treatments were used, similar to those in medieval times.&lt;ref name="Laffey2003"/&gt; Madhouse owners sometimes boasted of their ability with the [[whip]]. Treatment in the few public asylums was also barbaric, often secondary to prisons. The most notorious was [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]] where at one time spectators could pay a penny to watch the inmates as a form of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |date=26 November 2003 |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bedlam |entry=Bedlam: Hospital, Beckenham, England, United Kingdom |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02387b.htm |entry=Bedlam |first=James Joseph |last=Walsh |date=1907 |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |volume=2 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |location=New York |access-date=3 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concepts based in humoral theory gradually gave way to metaphors and terminology from mechanics and other developing [[physical sciences]]. Complex new schemes were developed for the [[classification of mental disorders]], influenced by emerging systems for the [[biological classification]] of organisms and [[nosology|medical classification]] of diseases.

The term "crazy" (from [[Middle English]] meaning cracked) and insane (from [[Latin]] insanus meaning unhealthy) came to mean mental disorder in this period. The term "[[Lunatic|lunacy]]", long used to refer to periodic disturbance or epilepsy, came to be synonymous with insanity. "Madness", long in use in root form since at least the early centuries AD, and originally meaning crippled, hurt or foolish, came to mean loss of reason or self-restraint. "Psychosis", from Greek "principle of life/animation", had varied usage referring to a condition of the mind/soul. "Nervous", from an Indo-European root meaning to wind or twist, meant [[muscle]] or [[:wikt:vigor|vigor]], was adopted by physiologists to refer to the body's electrochemical signalling process (thus called the [[nervous system]]), and was then used to refer to nervous disorders and [[neurosis]]. "Obsession", from a Latin root meaning to sit on or sit against, originally meant to besiege or be possessed by an evil spirit, came to mean a fixed idea that could decompose the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-440X(93)90063-A |last=Dalby |first=J.Thomas |date=November 1993 |title=Terms of Madness: Historical Linguistics |journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=392–395 |pmid=8131383 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of madhouses and the professionalization and specialization of medicine, there was considerable incentive for [[medical doctors]] to become involved. In the 18th century, they began to stake a claim to a monopoly over madhouses and treatments. Madhouses could be a lucrative business, and many made a fortune from them. There were some [[bourgeois]] ex-patient reformers who opposed the often brutual regimes, blaming both the madhouse owners and the medics, who in turn resisted the reforms.&lt;ref name="Crossley2006"/&gt;

Towards the end of the 18th century, a [[moral treatment]] movement developed, that implemented more humane, psychosocial and personalized approaches. Notable figures included the medic [[Vincenzo Chiarugi]] in Italy under [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] leadership; the ex-patient superintendent [[Pussin]] and the psychologically inclined medic [[Philippe Pinel]] in revolutionary France; the [[Quakers]] in England, led by businessman [[William Tuke]]; and later, in the United States, campaigner [[Dorothea Dix]].

===19th century===
The 19th century, in the context of industrialization and population growth, saw a massive expansion of the number and size of insane asylums in every Western country, a process called "the great confinement" or the "asylum era". Laws were introduced to compel authorities to deal with those judged insane by family members and hospital superintendents. Although originally based on the concepts and structures of moral treatment, they became large impersonal institutions overburdened with large numbers of people with a complex mix of mental and social-economic problems.&lt;ref name="Wright1997"/&gt; The success of moral treatment had cast doubt on the approach of medics, and many had opposed it, but by the mid-19th century many became advocates of it but argued that the mad also often had physical/organic problems, so that both approaches were necessary. This argument has been described as an important step in the profession's eventual success in securing a monopoly on the treatment of lunacy. However, it is well documented that very little therapeutic activity occurred in the new asylum system, that medics were little more than administrators who seldom attended to patients, and then mainly for other physical problems.&lt;ref name="Crossley2006"/&gt;

Clear descriptions of some [[syndromes]], such as the condition that would later be termed [[schizophrenia]], have been identified as relatively rare prior to the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Torrey |first=E.

Numerous different [[classification of mental disorders|classification schemes]] and diagnostic terms were developed by different authorities, taking an increasingly anatomical-clinical descriptive approach. The term "[[psychiatry]]" was coined as the medical specialty became more academically established. Asylum superintendents, later to be psychiatrists, were generally called "alienists" because they were thought to deal with people [[Social alienation|alienated]] from society; they adopted largely isolated and managerial roles in the asylums while milder "neurotic" conditions were dealt with by neurologists and general physicians, although there was overlap for conditions such as [[neurasthenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[American Neurological Association]] |website=Tempus et Hora: Time and the Hour (ANA 125th Anniversary) |url=http://www.aneuroa.org/html/c19html/010-NandP.htm |title=Neurology and Psychiatry: Together and Separate |access-date=24 July 2008 |archive-date=26 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926131636/http://www.aneuroa.org/html/c19html/010-NandP.htm |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States it was proposed that [[Slavery in the United States|black slaves]] who tried to escape were suffering from a mental disorder termed [[drapetomania]]. It was then argued in scientific journals that mental disorders were rare under conditions of slavery but became more common following [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]], and later that mental illness in African Americans was due to evolutionary factors or various negative characteristics, and that they were not suitable for therapeutic intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ap.28.3.226 |last1=Harris |first1=Herbert W. |last2=Felder |first2=Diane |last3=Clark |first3=Michelle O. |date=September 2004 |title=A Psychiatric Residency Curriculum on the Care of African American Patients |journal=Academic Psychiatry |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=226–239 |pmid=15507559 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1870s in North America, officials who ran Lunatic Asylums renamed them Insane Asylums. By the late century, the term "asylum" had lost its original meaning as a place of refuge, [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] or [[safety]], and was associated with abuses that had been widely publicized in the media, including by ex-patient organization the [[Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society]] and ex-patients like [[Elizabeth Packard]].&lt;ref name="Reaume2002"/&gt;

The relative proportion of the public officially diagnosed with mental disorders was increasing, however. This has been linked to various factors, including possibly humanitarian concern; incentives for professional status/money; a lowered tolerance of communities for unusual behavior due to the existence of asylums to place them in (this affected the poor the most); and the strain placed on families by industrialization.&lt;ref name="Crossley2006"/&gt;

===20th century===
The turn of the 20th century saw the development of [[psychoanalysis]], which came to the fore later. [[Kraepelinian dichotomy|Kraepelin's classification]] gained popularity, including the separation of mood disorders from what would later be termed schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Berrios |editor1-first=German E. |editor2-last=Porter |editor2-first=Roy |date=1995 |title=The History of Clinical Psychiatry: The Origin and History of Psychiatric Disorders |location=London |publisher=Athlone Press |oclc=32823926 |isbn=978-0-485-24211-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

Asylum superintendents sought to improve the image and medical status of their profession. Asylum "inmates" were increasingly referred to as "patients" and asylums renamed as hospitals. Referring to people as having a "mental illness" dates from this period in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Reaume2002"/&gt;

In the United States, a "mental hygiene" movement, originally defined in the 19th century, gained momentum and aimed to "prevent the disease of insanity" through [[public health]] methods and clinics.&lt;ref name=Mandell2007&gt;{{cite web|last=Mandell |first=Wallace |date=2007 |url=http://www.jhsph.edu/dept/mh/about/origins.html |title=Origins of Mental Health: The Realization of an Idea |website=Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health: Department of Mental Health |access-date=9 August 2008 |archive-date=6 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706150907/http://www.jhsph.edu/dept/mh/about/origins.html |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[mental health]] became more popular, however. [[Clinical psychology]] and [[social work]] developed as [[professions]] alongside psychiatry. Theories of [[eugenics]] led to [[compulsory sterilization]] movements in many countries around the world for several decades, often encompassing patients in public mental institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kavles |first=Daniel J. |date=14 August 1999 |title=Eugenics and human rights |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/319/7207/435 |url-access=subscription |journal=BMJ |volume=319 |issue=7207 |pages=435–438 |pmid=10445929 |pmc=1127045 |doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7207.435 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World War I]] saw a massive increase of conditions that came to be termed "[[shell shock]]".

In [[Nazi]] Germany, the institutionalized mentally ill were among the earliest targets of sterilization campaigns and covert "[[euthanasia]]" programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Livingston |first=Kathy |date=16 August 2003 |url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p107506_index.html |title=Deciding Who Dies: Evaluating the Social Worth of People With Mental Illness during the Holocaust |conference=Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association |location=Atlanta Hilton Hotel, Atlanta, GA |conference-url=http://www.asanet.org/news-events/meetings |publisher=[[American Sociological Association]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that over 200,000 individuals with mental disorders of all kinds were put to death, although their mass murder has received relatively little historical attention. Despite not being formally ordered to take part, [[psychiatrists]] and psychiatric institutions were at the center of justifying, planning and carrying out the atrocities at every stage, and "constituted the connection" to the later annihilation of Jews and other "undesirables" such as homosexuals in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Strous |first=Rael D. |title=Psychiatry during the Nazi era: ethical lessons for the modern professional |url=http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/6/1/8 |journal=Annals of General Psychiatry |volume=6 |page=8 |date=27 February 2007 |pmid=17326822 |pmc=1828151 |doi=10.1186/1744-859X-6-8 |doi-access=free }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas of the world, funding was often cut for asylums, especially during periods of economic decline, and during wartime in particular many patients starved to death.&lt;ref name="Fakhourya2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fakhoury |first1=Walid |last2=Priebe |first2=Stefan |title=Deinstitutionalization and reinstitutionalization: major changes in the provision of mental healthcare |journal=Psychiatry |volume=6 |pages=313–316 |date=August 2007 |doi=10.1016/j.mppsy.2007.05.008 |issue=8 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers received increased psychiatric attention, and [[World War II]] saw the development in the US of a new psychiatric manual for categorizing mental disorders, which along with existing systems for collecting census and hospital statistics led to the first [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) followed suit with a section on mental disorders.

Previously restricted to the treatment of severely disturbed people in asylums, psychiatrists cultivated clients with a broader range of problems, and between 1917 and 1970 the number practicing outside institutions swelled from 8 percent to 66 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosenthal |first=Susan |date=19 May 2008 |url=http://www.dissidentvoice.org/2008/05/mental-illness-or-social-sickness/ |title=Mental Illness or Social Sickness? |website=Dissident Voice |accessdate=3 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[stress (biological)|stress]], having emerged from [[endocrinology]] work in the 1930s, was popularized with an increasingly broad biopsychosocial meaning, and was increasingly linked to mental disorders.&lt;ref name="Viner1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/030631299029003003 |doi-access=free |last1=Viner |first1=Russell |title=Putting Stress in Life: Hans Selye and the Making of Stress Theory |journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=391–410 |date=June 1999 |jstor=285410 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Outpatient commitment]]" laws were gradually expanded or introduced in some countries.

[[lobotomy|Lobotomies]], [[Insulin shock therapy]], [[Electro convulsive therapy]], and the "[[neuroleptic]]" [[chlorpromazine]] came into use mid-century.

An [[antipsychiatry]] movement came to the fore in the 1960s. [[Deinstitutionalization]] gradually occurred in the West, with isolated [[psychiatric hospitals]] being closed down in favor of [[community mental health services]]. However, inadequate services and continued social exclusion often led to many being [[homeless]] or in prison.&lt;ref name=Torreyetal1992&gt;{{Cite report |year=1992 |last1=Torrey |first1=E.

Other kinds of [[psychiatric medication]] gradually came into use, such as "[[antidepressants|psychic energizers]]" and [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]]. [[Benzodiazepines]] gained widespread use in the 1970s for anxiety and depression, until dependency problems curtailed their popularity. Advances in [[neuroscience]] and [[genetics]] led to new research agendas. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] was developed. Through the 1990s, new SSRI [[antidepressants]] became some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the world.

The DSM and then ICD adopted new criteria-based [[classification of mental disorders|classification]], representing a return to a Kraepelin-like descriptive system. The number of "official" diagnoses saw a large expansion, although homosexuality was gradually downgraded and dropped in the face of human rights protests. Different regions sometimes developed alternatives such as the [[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]] or [[Latin American Guide for Psychiatric Diagnosis]].

[[DSM-IV]] and previous versions of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' presented extremely high [[comorbidity]], diagnostic heterogeneity of the categories, unclear boundaries, that have been interpreted as intrinsic anomalies of the criterial, [[Neopositivism|neopositivistic]] approach leading the system to a state of [[Replication crisis|scientific crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aragona|first1=Massimiliano|date=March 2009|title=The role of comorbidity in the crisis of the current psychiatric classification system|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_psychiatry_and_psychology/v016/16.1.aragona.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry, &amp; Psychology|volume=16|pages=1–11|doi=10.1353/ppp.0.0211|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, a radical rethinking of the concept of mental disorder and the need of a radical scientific revolution in psychiatric taxonomy was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aragona|first1=Massimiliano|date=June 2009|title=The concept of mental disorder and the DSM-V|url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A08-02.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–14}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th Century ===
In early 20th century, [[lobotomy]] was introduced till the mid-1950s.

In 1927 [[insulin coma therapy]] was introduced and used till 1960. Physicians deliberately put the patient into a low blood sugar coma because they thought that large fluctuations in insulin levels could alter the function of the brain. Risks included prolonged coma. [[Electroconvulsive therapy|Electroconvulsive Therapy]] (ECT) was later adopted as a substitution to this.

He had four brothers and two sisters.&lt;ref&gt;https://familysearch.org/tree#view=ancestor&amp;person=KZS6-YX4&lt;/ref&gt; After attending school in the [[Mission District, San Francisco, California|Mission District]], he went to work as an office boy in a commission house. He married Annie Marshall Reid (1872&amp;ndash;1956) and had at least one son: James Rolph, III (1904-1980).

Rolph entered the shipping business in 1900, by forming a partnership with George Hind. He would over the next decade serve as president of two banks, one of which he helped establish. Although he was asked to run for mayor in 1909, he chose to wait until 1911 to run for mayor—a position that he would hold for nineteen years. As mayor, he was known as "Sunny Jim" and his theme song was "There Are Smiles That Make You Happy". In 1915 he appeared as himself in an early documentary film titled ''[[Mabel and Fatty Viewing the World's Fair at San Francisco]]'', which was directed by and starred [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]]. In 1924, Rolph appeared as himself in a [[Slim Summerville]] comedy short film, ''Hello, Frisco.''

Rolph knew of the power in San Francisco of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|Roman Catholic Church]]. Italians, Irish, French and Germans made up the majority of the population of the City. He established a deep friendship with Archbishop [[Edward Joseph Hanna]]. In turn, Hanna would support Rolph in his 1930 election as governor of California.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In addition to his mayoral duties and overseeing his shipping interests, he directed the Ship Owners and Merchants Tugboat Company and the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. He also was vice-president of the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] and president of the [[Merchants Exchange Building (San Francisco)|Merchants' Exchange]]. He resigned in 1931 to assume the office of governor of California.

Rolph received considerable criticism for publicly praising the citizens of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] following the November 1933 [[lynching]] of the confessed kidnapper-murderers of [[Brooke Hart]], a local department store heir, while promising to [[pardon]] anyone involved, thereby earning the nickname, "Governor Lynch."&lt;ref name="Dreams"&gt;{{cite book | title=Endangered Dreams: The Great Depression in California | author=[[Kevin Starr]] | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1996 |  isbn=0195100808}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|98}}  Four days before the lynching he had announced he would not call on the [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] to prevent the lynching, which was already being discussed locally.&lt;ref name="Dreams" /&gt;{{rp|149}}

After violence erupted during the [[San Joaquin cotton strike]] in October 1933, Governor Rolph appointed a fact-finding committee to investigate the deaths of several strikers.  When the committee met in [[Visalia, California|Visalia]] on October 19, 1933, [[Caroline Decker]], a labor activist who had taken part in other California agricultural actions, took testimony from the strikers who testified about the growers' assaults on striking workers.

==Death==
After suffering several heart attacks, he died in [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] on June 2, 1934, aged 64, three years into his term. Rolph was the second governor to die in office, the first being [[Washington Bartlett]] in 1887. He is buried at Greenlawn Memorial Park in [[Colma, California]]. He was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor [[Frank Merriam]] in the Governor's Office.

==Legacy==
One of the unofficial names of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] is the James "Sunny Jim" Rolph Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|author=Business, Transportation and Housing Agency; Department of Transportation |title=2008 Named Freeways, Highways, Structures and Other Appurtenances in California |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/Named_Freeways.pdf |publisher=State of California |date=January 2009 |accessdate=24 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014034335/http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/Named_Freeways.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography and career ==
Garcia was born in 1954 in [[El Paso, Texas]] and completed his B.S. in Biology at the [[University of Dallas]] in 1976, where he is noted as one of their [[University of Dallas#Notable people|notable people]]. He received his M.D. from the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical School]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://tucson.com/news/local/education/college/triple-threat-ua-health-vp-to-earn-k-year/article_303e9a3e-cb28-5604-90f0-eec9dda203ee.html&lt;/ref&gt; He completed internship and residency training in Internal Medicine at the [[University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics]] (1980–1983) and fellowship training in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at [[Albany Medical College]] (1983–1985).

Garcia began his academic career as an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the [[University of Texas Health Center at Tyler]] (1985–1988) where he established the first Occupational Lung Center. He was subsequently recruited as an Associate Professor to [[Indiana University School of Medicine]] (1988–1998) where (in 1992) he became the youngest endowed full Professor in Indiana University School of Medicine history as the Dr. Calvin H. English Professor of Medicine. He was locally recognized as a staunch advocate for institutional diversity and for his volunteer work and community service with Indiana's Hispanic migrant farm workers. For these efforts, Garcia received the State of Indiana's [[Otis Bowen]] Community Service award (1994) and the Physician Community Service Award (1994) from the Indiana State Medical Association.

In 1998, Garcia was recruited to [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] serving in several major academic leadership positions including the [[David Marine|Dr. David Marine]] Professor of Medicine, Environmental Health Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, and the Director of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (1998–2005). During his tenure at Division Director (1998 - 2005), Garcia doubled the number of faculty and grants with considerable diversity, including the expansion of PhDs, women and under-represented minorities. He initiated significant growth and expansion in lung transplantation, pulmonary hypertension, adult cystic fibrosis, health care outcomes, vascular biology, asthma and COPD research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/pulmonary/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Garcia was awarded the Levine Excellence in Mentoring Award in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/medicine/research/levine_award_recipients.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He is also responsible for research growth in the Division level of $2 million/year in NIH funding in 1998 and over $30&amp;nbsp;million/year and a top national ranking among US academic pulmonary and critical care divisions.

In May 2005 Garcia joined The [[University of Chicago]] as the Lowell T. Coggeshall Professor of Medicine and Chairman of the Department of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |coauthors= |title=Joe G.N. Garcia appointed chairman of medicine at the University of Chicago |url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2005/20050501-joe-garcia.html |quote=Joe G.N. "Skip" Garcia, MD--a leading authority on lung biology and disease; the genetics, prevention, and treatment of pulmonary edema; and the molecular biology of blood vessels--has been appointed the Lowell T. Coggeshall Professor and chairman of the department of medicine, the largest department at the University of Chicago, effective May 1, 2005. ... |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |date=May 1, 2005 |accessdate=2014-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as chair (2005 - 2009) Garcia led the strategic growth of the University of Chicago's largest department. Under his leadership, research funding exceeded $80 million annually with the Department's national ranking for federal research rising from #25 to #10 (2005 - 2009). While chair, Garcia directed several initiatives improving the gender, racial and ethnic diversity of the Department's faculty and residency fellowship training programs. h&lt;ref&gt;https://news.uic.edu/health-system-making-progress&lt;/ref&gt; With a dedicated focus on junior faculty development and the physician-scientist career pathway, under Garcia's leadership, the department of Medicine experienced a 200% increase in the number of individually awarded [[NIH]] career awards (K-Series). Based on the success of these initiatives, in 2006, Garcia was awarded the Diversity Award from the Bowman Society and the Association of Professors of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;https://pritzker.uchicago.edu/page/bowman-society&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating the push to precision medicine, Garcia established the Section of Genetic Medicine and recruited Nancy Cox, PhD and the first section chief and launched the Translational Research Initiative in the Department of Medicine (TRIDOM).,&lt;ref&gt;https://cri.uchicago.edu/portfolio/tridom/&lt;/ref&gt; a large-scale sample collection effort enabling investigators to link clinical information on health and disease status to biological samples.&lt;ref&gt;https://cri.uchicago.edu/portfolio/tridom/&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, he was named the Vice Chancellor for Research and Earl M Bane Professor of Medicine at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] overseeing an almost $400 million research portfolio (70% biomedical research).

'''John Rattray''' (22 September 1707 – 5 July 1771) was an Edinburgh surgeon who served as surgeon to [[Prince Charles Edward Stuart]] during the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]. He was a proficient archer, winning the [[Edinburgh Arrow]] on two occasions, however it is for his golfing achievements that he is principally remembered. A skilful golfer, Rattray won the first competition organised by the Company of Gentleman Golfers (later [[the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers]]) to become the 'Captain of Goff' for a year. In this capacity he signed the first ever [[Rules of Golf]].

== Early life ==

John Rattray was born on 22 September 1707 in Craighall Castle, the family seat of [[Clan Rattray]], near the village of [[Blairgowrie and Rattray]] in Perthshire, Scotland. His father the Rt Rev [[Thomas Rattray]] (1684–1743) was an Episcopalian priest who became the Bishop of Dunkeld, then of Brechin and was elected Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church.&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Strong, 'Rattray, Thomas, of Craighall (1684–1743)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2005 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23166]: doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/23166&lt;/ref&gt; On his death in 1743 his elder son James became clan chief and inherited the estate. As the second son John Rattray had no such inheritance and he trained as a surgeon in Edinburgh by apprenticeship to the surgeon John Semple between 1728 and 1735, when he began surgical practice in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="Wallis"&gt;Wallis PJ, Wallis R, Whittet T. Eighteenth century medics: subscriptions, licenses, apprenticeships. Newcastle. University of Newcastle. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; To enhance his professional status he applied to become a freeman (or fellow) of the Incorporation of Surgeons of Edinburgh (later the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/b21465812|title=List of fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh [electronic resource] : from the year 1581 to 31st December 1873|last=Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|last2=University of Glasgow.

== Sporting activities ==

Rattray joined the [[Royal Company of Archers]] in 1731 and won the archery competition for the silver punch bowl on 4 occasions (1732, 1735, 1740, and 1742).&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;Strachan CJL, Barker J, 'Rattray, John (1707–1771)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/64814&lt;/ref&gt; The Company's most prestigious prize, the [[Edinburgh Arrow]] or Silver Arrow was presented to the Company by Edinburgh Town Council in 1709 as a prize for an annual archery competition. Rattray won this twice, in 1735 and 1744. He was also a skilled golfer and his prowess at golf is recorded in this extract from the mock heroic poem 'The Goff' by Rev. Thomas Mathison (1720–1760) published in 1743, the first poem devoted to the sport of golf.&lt;ref&gt;Golf in Scotland. National Library of Scotland. http://digital.nls.uk/golf-in-scotland/book/&lt;/ref&gt;

:North from Edina eight furlongs and more
:Lies that fam’d field, on Fortha’s sounding shore,
:Here Caledonian chiefs for health resort,
:Confirm their sinews by the manly sport....
:Rattray for skill, and Crosse for strength renowned,
:Stuart and Leslie beat the sandy ground....
:Yea here great Forbes, patron of the just,
:The dread of villains and the good man’s trust
:When spent with toils in serving human kind,
:His body recreates and unbends his mind.

The ‘fam’d field’ referred to is [[Leith Links]], an area of links grassland in the burgh of Leith where the self-styled 'Company of Gentleman Golfers' began to golf regularly. The 'great Forbes' mentioned is [[Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden|Duncan Forbes of Culloden]] (1685–1747), Lord President of the Court of Session, Scotland's most senior law officer and one of Rattray's regular golfing companions.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton D, Lindsley K, Mathison T. The thorn tree clique : a new analysis of Mathieson's poem The Goff. Kilmacolm : Partick Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Their friendship was to save Rattray's life.

== The first rules of golf ==
The Gentleman Golfers had approached the Edinburgh Town Council asking them to donate a silver club to be played for in an annual golf competition over Leith Links, in much the same way as the Council provided the silver arrow for archery competitions. The Town Council approved this request on 7 March 1744 and published the 'Regulations' for the competition. These were to do with the administration of the competition indicating that the draw should be made from a bonnet, that it should be open to any golfer from Great Britain &amp; Ireland and that clerks should mark down each stroke. In their document the Council note that the golfers have already drawn up the 'Articles and Laws in playing at golf', and these, the original rules of golf, were used for this competition.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;Johnston AJ, Johnston JF. The chronicles of golf: 1457 to 1857. Cleveland, Ohio:AJ &amp; JF Johnston; 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was played over five holes at Leith Links: Sawmill ({{Convert|414|yd|m}}), North-mid ({{Convert|461|yd|m}}), East ({{Convert|426|yd|m}}), South-mid ({{Convert|495|yd|m}}) and Thorntree ({{Convert|435|yd|m}}). It is likely that they played three rounds of this course.&lt;ref name="Clapcott"&gt;Clapcott CB. The early days of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (1744–1764): some facts and conclusions relative thereto. National Library of Scotland; 1938&lt;/ref&gt;  On 2 April 1744 Rattray won the first competition held over this course, winning the silver club and earning the title ‘Captain of the Goff’. It is Rattray’s signature that appears below the 13 original rules of golf&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golf in Scotland: articles and laws|url=http://digital.nls.uk/golf-in-scotland/rules/articles-laws.html|publisher=National Library of Scotland|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in the minute book of the [[Muirfield|Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers]]. It is not clear whether he signed this in his capacity as captain of the golf or as the author of the rules. As was customary for entries in the minutes, he has written 'Cptn' after his signature, which some commentators have interpreted as indicating that he simply signed the minute as captain, the rules having been a joint effort of the golfers, who included some of the best legal brains in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Johnston" /&gt; The rules signed by Rattray lay undisturbed in the minute book of the Honourable Company for some 200 years until discovered there by the golf historian CB Clapcott in 1937.&lt;ref name="Clapcott" /&gt; The rules are now in the collection of the [[National Library of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rattray|first=John|title=Articles &amp; Laws in Playing at Golf|year=1744|publisher=Company of Gentleman Golfers|location=Edinburgh|page=Acc.11208/2|url=http://digital.nls.uk/golf-in-scotland/rules/articles-laws.html|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The St Andrews golfers, adopted them with minor modifications in 1754 and they still form the basis of many of the modern laws of the game. These original [[rules of golf]] comprised 12 general rules and one local rule applicable to the Leith course.

== Role in the 1745 Jacobite rising ==

On 19 August 1745 [[Prince Charles Edward Stuart]] raised his standard at [[Glenfinnan]] marking the start of his attempt to claim the British throne. To gather support he asked clans and families, likely to be sympathetic, to join his cause. As prominent Episcopalians the Rattrays were likely supporters, but James Rattray, by then the clan chief, opted to donate £50 rather than join the standard. John Rattray joined the Jacobite army just after their victory at the [[Battle of Prestonpans]] on 21 September, when the call went out to Edinburgh surgeons to care for the wounded. Amongst those who responded to the call were [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]] (a staunch Hanoverian) and [[Alexander Wood (surgeon)|Alexander ("Lang Sandy") Wood]]. Rattray rode the five miles from his house at South Foulis Close near the foot of Edinburgh's High Street with his colleague [[John Lauder (surgeon)|John Lauder]], Deacon (president) of the Incorporation of Surgeons.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; Lauder later claimed that they had treated some 300 wounded and accommodated many of these at their own expense, but as this claim was made as part of a plea for his life, it may well have been exaggerated. Rattray stayed with the Jacobite army as it advanced into England then retreated from Derby, eventually becoming Surgeon-general and personal surgeon to Prince Charles. After the battle of Culloden, Rattray surrendered to the Hanoverians and was imprisoned in Inverness, but he and Lauder were not allowed to treat the wounded among their fellow prisoners.

[[Robert Forbes (bishop)|Robert Forbes]], bishop of Ross and Caithness, in his detailed contemporary account of events of the '45 rising ''The Lyon in Mourning''&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;Forbes R, Paton H, Scottish History Society. The Lyon in mourning, or, A collection of speeches, letters, journals etc. relative to the affairs of Prince Charles Edward Stuart. Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press for the Scottish History Society; 1975&lt;/ref&gt; describes how Rattray was taunted by a Hanoverian officer "We know well what you are sir, the Pretender’s surgeon. If anyone hangs you shall." Rattray's golfing companion [[Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden]] a staunch Hanoverian, made a personal plea of intercession on behalf of Rattray to the Duke of Cumberland, which was successful, as was a subsequent plea for Lauder. They were freed but Cumberland ordered that they be rearrested in Edinburgh and they were held in London until January 1747 when they were finally released having signed an oath of obedience to the King.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;

== Later life ==

Rattray returned to surgical practice in Edinburgh and to golf. In 1751 he again won the golf competition for the silver club and continued to practice as a surgeon until at least 1766.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; He died in Edinburgh on 5 July 1771.

{{nihongo|'''Lake Iruka'''|入鹿池|Irukaike}} is a [[reservoir]] located near the [[Meiji Mura]] theme park in [[Inuyama, Aichi]], [[Japan]].

It is reportedly the second largest reservoir in Japan.

In 1868 the dam holding the reservoir collapsed after heavy rain. In the resulting flood, 941 people lost their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ug3h-itkr/oguchi/iruka.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2001-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010622144824/http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ug3h-itkr/oguchi/iruka.html |archivedate=2001-06-22 |df= }} (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

This article includes 3 '''lists of [[list of sovereign states|countries of the world]] and their total expenditure on health [[per capita]]'''. Total expenditure includes both public and private expenditures.

The first table and bar chart lists [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development#Member countries|member countries]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). With each country's total expenditure on health [[per capita]] in [[purchasing power parity|PPP]] [[U.S. dollars]].

The next 2 tables use data from the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). One table uses U.S. dollars per capita. The other table uses 2011 [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] [[Geary–Khamis dollar|international US dollars]] (inflation-adjusted to 2011 dollars).

The chart to the right measures the total cost of health care (public and private expenditures) as a percent of [[GDP]] (gross domestic product) for a few nations. GDP is a measure of the total economy of a nation.

== Lourdes Medical Center of Burlington County ==
{{main|Lourdes Medical Center of Burlington County}}
Located at 218 A Sunset Road in Willingboro, Lourdes Medical Center of Burlington County is a 249-bed community hospital.

== Other entities ==

=== Lourdes Wellness Center ===
Founded in 1979, the Lourdes Wellness Center combines mainstream medicine, alternative therapies and spirituality to promote healthy lifestyles. The center, which averages more than 30,000 visits a year, offers acupuncture, massage, yoga, health-education programs and community-based services.&lt;ref&gt;Lourdes Wellness Center&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the center is home to an integrative family medicine practice and the Lourdes Institute of Wholistic Studies, which offers an Associate degree in Massage Therapy and certificate programs in massage therapy, reflexology and yoga teacher training. The center has facilities in [[Collingswood, New Jersey|Collingswood]].

=== Our Lady of Lourdes School of Nursing ===
Since opening in 1961, Our Lady of Lourdes School of Nursing has graduated more than 1,200 nurses. Located in Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center’s new critical care tower, it is the only Catholic-oriented nursing school in southern New Jersey.
Students have the opportunity to simultaneously earn a Diploma in Nursing and an Associate’s Degree in science from Camden County College. Graduates are eligible to apply for the New Jersey State Board of Nursing examinations for registered nurse licensure and to enter into baccalaureate nursing programs with transfer credit.

The school is accredited by the New Jersey Board of Nursing and the National League for Nursing.&lt;ref&gt;Our Lady of Lourdes School of Nursing Web site&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outreach programs ==
As a faith-based institution, Lourdes Health System devotes many resources to assisting the less fortunate. The outreach programs provided by Lourdes Health System have won numerous recognitions, including the 1995 Foster G. McGaw Prize from the American Hospital Association. Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center was the first Catholic hospital in the nation to win this award for excellence in community service. Those outreach programs include:

*'''Project H.O.P.E. (Homeless Outreach Program Enrichment)''': Started in 1993, this initiative provides medical, social and advocacy services for the homeless of Camden, N.J. through clinics, a mobile health van and other street outreach. Clients receive comprehensive medical care, physical exams, tuberculosis and HIV testing, STD evaluation and treatment, drug and alcohol counseling, employment counseling, housing referral services and food and clothing distribution.
*'''Community Health Practice''': This all-volunteer clinic provides primary and specialty medical care to families who are uninsured or underinsured. The practice’s main objective is to provide care until patients acquire insurance coverage through employment, government assistance or other forms of aid. Some patients have been homeless people whom Lourdes helped find employment and housing. The practice serves more than 1,300 patients annually.
*'''Osborn Family Health Center''': Founded in 1974 to provide optimal prenatal care to the women of Camden and primary care to their families, the Osborn Family Health Center offers family practice, obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, lab testing and social services in a facility across the street from Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center. Osborn serves more 15,000 patients and handles 45,000 appointments annually. It is a private practice, treating individuals by appointment, rather than a walk-in clinic. Patients are seen by staff physicians who are employed by the health center, rather than by medical residents or a rotating staff. This allows for better physician-patient relationship and leads to better long-term care. Osborn distributes thousands of books a year to pediatric patients through its Reach Out and Read program and used-clothing through a boutique staffed by a volunteer.
*'''The Bridge''': This program addresses the needs of at-risk teens in Camden and surrounding communities.  The Bridge was founded in 1979 to provide a safe haven for young people to freely talk about their concerns and the issues they face and to help them develop leadership skills. The Bridge began with weekly drop-in sessions, but has expanded to offer programs in collaboration with schools, churches, businesses, community agencies and law enforcement. The Bridge works closely with the '''Camden County Prosecutor’s Office''', offering anti-violence and anti-bullying programs to schools.
*'''Senior Dining Program''': This program at Lourdes Medical Center of Burlington County offers discounts on meals provided in the hospital’s cafeteria. The program is designed to improve seniors’ access to nutritious meals, provide socialization and health screenings and information.
*'''Parish Health Nursing''': The program works with congregations of various denominations to promote healthy lifestyles, provide information on available resources and encourage individuals to assume primary responsibility for their own health. Attendees of educational sessions include registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, parish health ministers and others who have a working knowledge of parish nursing and health ministries. Lourdes conducts these sessions in conjunction with [[La Salle University]]. Attendees are taught to focus on the whole person when emphasizing wellness, disease prevention, health promotion and healing, linking the interrelationship of mind, body and spirit. The successfully trained parish nurse can help congregants access and navigate the health system; institute programs to promote healthy lifestyles and support groups; provide education on health issues; provide selected medical screenings; and support hospitalized or homebound family members.&lt;ref&gt;Our Lady of Lourdes Health Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsors==
The [[Third Order of Saint Francis#Sisters of St. Francis|Franciscan Sisters of Allegany, New York]],&lt;ref name=AlleganySisters&gt;[http://www.alleganyfranciscans.org Franciscan Sisters of Allegany] official website. Retrieved 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; trace their beginnings to April 25, 1859, when, in the chapel of St. Bonaventure College and Seminary, Father Pamfilo da Magliano, O.S.F., gave the habit of the Third Order of St. Francis and the name, Sister Mary Joseph, to Mary Jane Todd. Father Pamfilo, the custos-Provincial of the Friars Minor of the Immaculate Conception Custody, had come with three other friars to western New York in 1855 at the invitation of Bishop John Timon, C.M., of the Diocese of Buffalo and [[Nicholas Devereux]], a Catholic layman and land owner. The friars had come to educate young men at St. Bonaventure and carry on pastoral work in the area. Bishop Timon had also asked Father Pamfilo to “seek for Sisters of the Third Order” to provide education for the young women of the area, and his search led him to form a new congregation in Allegany, New York.
 
After the reception of Sister Mary Joseph, Ellen Fallon was received on June 24, 1859, and took the name Sister Mary Bridget. Several months later, these two sisters were joined by Mary Anne O'Neil, a 15-year-old girl from New Jersey who had been exhorted by Father Pamfilo, “to be generous with the Lord despite her young years.” Mary Anne was received on Dec. 8, 1859, and took the name Sister Mary Teresa.
 
These three women formed the nucleus of the new community which soon began to attract other young women from the surrounding areas. From the beginning of the congregation, the sisters were under the jurisdiction of Father Pamfilo. He appointed the officers of the new community until 1865, when he presented the sisters with their first statutes, which had been adapted from those of the Franciscan Sisters in Glasgow, Scotland. That same year, the sisters elected Sister Mary Teresa O'Neil as their general superior, who served in this capacity for 55 years.

The new community grew, and the sisters sought to serve the needs of the church in a variety of ministries. In 1860, St. Elizabeth Academy opened in Allegany for the education of young women, and from this beginning the sisters branched out to open schools in Connecticut, New York and other East Coast states. In 1879, three sisters were sent to Jamaica and British West Indies, and the Franciscan Sisters of Allegany became the first American-founded congregation of religious women to send sisters to foreign missions.
 
In the 1880s and 1890s, the sisters became affiliated with hospitals in Boston and New York City. They also expanded to homes for the young and elderly, pastoral and social work. Many of these ministries, including health care, continue today.&lt;ref name=AlleganySisters/&gt;

== History ==
Southern New Jersey experienced a rapid growth in population immediately preceding and during World War II. Many of the new residents were Catholic, and their fast influx demanded the formation of new parishes and facilities. In the early 1940s, Bishop Bartholomew J. Eustace invited the Franciscan Sisters of Allegany to build a hospital in the Diocese of Camden. Bishop Eustace knew of the Sisters when they cared for his mother during her final years at their hospital, St. Elizabeth’s, in New York City.
 
In December 1945, the Dominican Sisters of the Perpetual Rosary agreed to sell a portion of their property at Haddon Avenue and Euclid Street in Camden to the Third Order Regular of St. Francis of Allegany, New York for the construction of a hospital. Construction began in September 1947, with Bishop Eustace laying the cornerstone a year later.
  
On March 15, 1950, 2½ years after ground was broken for Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center, construction was completed on the 300-bed hospital. On May 28, Bishop Eustace presided at a dedication ceremony attended by 3,000, including several hundred priests, physicians and civic leaders. The inscription above the main entrance, “The Body Is Often Curable — The Soul Is Ever So,” spoke to the new hospital’s commitment to Franciscan values.

The Diocese raised $1 million, or one-quarter the cost of the new hospital. The Franciscan Sisters assumed a debt of more than $3 million. The Rev. Mother Jean Marie Greeley appointed Mother Mary Paracleta the first hospital administrator. She served in that post until 1969, and was a driving force behind Lourdes’ initial growth.
 
Camden was a thriving city when Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center was planned and built. However, in the 1960s, Camden fell prey to an urban manufacturing decline and an exodus of middle-class residents to the suburbs.
 
The Franciscan Sisters realized there was a need to develop top-quality specialty services that would draw patients from throughout southern New Jersey. These services would support the hospital’s mission of staying in Camden and providing quality care to its residents while also serving the growing suburban population. The hospital developed several regional services to sustain the organization, including cardiology, high-risk maternity, physical rehabilitation, dialysis and organ transplantation.

The facility itself has been expanded and improved many times to meet the needs of the community.

Planning for the addition of a School of Nursing began in 1956. Groundbreaking for the school occurred in 1959 on the medical center’s campus, and the first class of nurses was accepted in 1961. “We may sometimes wonder why the sisters embark on such great projects,” Camden Bishop Justin J. McCarthy said during the school’s groundbreaking ceremony. “They always want to do great work for God. I’m sure the nurses trained here will obtain a true sense of the spirit of Christian charity. Let us not forget that the nurses are the right hand of the doctors.”

From 1970-71, the hospital underwent the first of several renovations, a $2 million project for intensive care, cardiac care and surgical recovery areas. In 1976, the medical center completed a $6.9 million construction project. The four-story addition housed a new 50-bed rehabilitation center, as well as expanded outpatient and emergency departments. In 1988, the medical center completed a three-year, $42 million renovation and expansion that included two new patient floors; a spacious solarium; new pediatrics, inpatient dialysis and mental health units; a women’s services floor; a new cardiac services floor; larger and modernized patient rooms throughout the medical center; new radiology and laboratory equipment; and new nursing stations.

Two years later, Angel’s Alley, one of the region’s first hospital-based child-care centers, opened. Angel’s Alley not only cares for the children of employees, but also those from the neighborhood, allowing their parents the opportunity to find productive, economically beneficial jobs.

In 1999, the Sister M. Elizabeth Corry Ambulatory Care Center opened across Haddon Avenue from the hospital. The {{convert|46000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building, named for the medical center’s long-time president, houses the Osborn Family Health Center, outpatient dialysis and organ transplant facilities.
 
In 2005, Lourdes opened a $60-million expansion that features a new emergency department, operating suites, patient rooms, laboratories and School of Nursing. Also in 2005, Lourdes, now with 410 beds, became the first hospital in the Delaware Valley to acquire a 64-slice CT scanner.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Star Herald, June 29, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extending the mission ===
For more than four decades, residents of Burlington County have relied on Lourdes Medical Center of Burlington County for their inpatient and outpatient health care.
 
The hospital was founded by a group of 11 physicians, led by Meyer Abrams, M.D., who felt the need to develop a hospital in the growing Burlington County community of Willingboro. The original Rancocas Valley Hospital opened in August 1961 and had 100 beds, operating suites, a maternity ward and emergency room. Eventually, the physicians’ group sold their interest in the hospital, all the while remaining as active members of the medical staff.
 
Over the years, the hospital underwent several changes in ownership and leadership.
Willingboro was at risk of losing the hospital when its owner, the Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation declared bankruptcy in the late 1990s. Lourdes purchased the hospital in 1998 for $45 million.
  
Immediately after purchasing the facility, Lourdes invested $20 million in a new critical care building. The expansion, which includes six state-of-the-art operating suites, a same-day surgery center, a 12-bed recovery unit and an expanded 20-bed critical-care unit opened in May 2001. In December 2002, the hospital was renamed Lourdes Medical Center of Burlington County and became a Catholic hospital following a dedication and blessing by the Most Rev. John Smith, Bishop of the Diocese of Trenton.
 
In 2003, the medical center opened a new $1.5 million cardiac catheterization laboratory and a new magnetic resonance imaging center, expanding the hospital’s diagnostic capabilities. In 2005, in conjunction with AcuityHealthcare of Charlotte, N.C., the facility opened Lourdes Specialty Hospital of Southern New Jersey, the region’s first unit for long-term acute-care patients.&lt;ref&gt;Burlington County Times, various articles; Lourdes Health System Public Relations Office&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospital has developed one of the region’s leading cancer programs with a range of diagnostic and treatment services, in addition to a variety of community outreach and support initiatives. Those include a patient navigator program; opening a caring boutique to assist cancer patients from throughout Burlington County with their aesthetic, physical and emotional needs; developing a resource center; and expanding community lectures and support options.

== Catholic Health East ==
In 1998, Lourdes merged with Catholic Health East (CHE), a multi-institutional Catholic health system co-sponsored by 10 religious congregations and Hope Ministries, a public juridic person within CHE. Based in Newtown Square, P.A., the system provides the means to ensure the continuation of the Catholic identity and operational strength of the sponsors’ health ministries, which are located in 11 eastern states from Maine to Florida.
 
CHE includes 33 acute care hospitals, four long term acute care hospitals, 36 freestanding and hospital-based long term care facilities, 12 assisted living facilities, five continuing care retirement communities, seven behavioral health and rehabilitation facilities, 25 home health/hospice agencies, and numerous ambulatory and community-based health services. Catholic Health East facilities employ approximately 50,000 full-time employees.

The '''Maddox rod''' test can be used to subjectively detect and measure a latent, manifest, horizontal or vertical [[strabismus]] for near and distance. The test is based on the principle of diplopic projection.&lt;ref&gt;Ansons, A. &amp; Davis, H. (2008). Diagnosis and Management of Ocular Motility Disorders, Third Edition. [Wiley Online Library]. {{DOI|10.1002/9780470698839}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissociation of the deviation is brought about by presenting a red line image to one eye and a white light to the other, while [[prism]]s are used to superimpose these and effectively measure the angle of deviation (horizontal and vertical). The strength of the [[prism]] is increased until the streak of the light passes through the centre of the [[prism]], as the strength of the [[prism]] indicates the amount of deviation present. The Maddox rod is a handheld instrument composed of red parallel plano convex cylinder [[Lens (optics)|lens]], which refracts light rays so that a point source of light is seen as a line or streak of light.&lt;ref&gt;Maddox rod. (n.d.) Millodot: Dictionary of Optometry and Visual Science, 7th edition. (2009). Retrieved October 19, 2014 from http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Maddox+rod&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the optical properties, the streak of light is seen perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jomtonline.com/jomt/articles/volumes/2/2/themaddoxrodtest.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Maddox Rod Test |publisher=Jomtonline.com|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment required in Maddox rod testing  ==
[[File:Maddox rod tools.jpg|thumb|Equipment used in Maddox rod testing. Top left (Maddox rod), top right (vertical base up and base down prisms), bottom left (pen torch) and bottom right (horizontal base out or in prisms)]]
*  Maddox rod
*  Light source at near (33&amp;nbsp;cm) and at distance (6m) 
*  Base in, base out, base up, base down [[prism]]s
*  Trial frames

==Indication of use==
The Maddox rod test should be used in cases of:
* Small to moderate (i.e..&lt;25pd) vertical deviations where there is simultaneous perception and [[Retinal correspondence|normal retinal correspondence]] (NRC)
* Decompensated phorias
* Acquired strabismus (rather than [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] or early onset)

==Method of assessment==
The method of assessing near and distance fixation is similar.
[[File:Maddox rod test results.jpg|thumb|A) Esodeviation, B) Exodeviation, C) Hypo-deviation, D) Hyper-deviation, E) No deviation]]
Method for measuring horizontal deviations: 
# When performing the clinical test, the room lights should be dimmed and only one light source should be visible. 
# When testing at near, the patient is to fixate on light source at 33&amp;nbsp;cm, which is held at eye level. When testing at distance, the patient is to fixate on a light source at 6m.
# Patient is instructed to fixate on the light source with both eyes opened.
# The Maddox rod is then placed over the fixating eye.
# To measure the horizontal deviation, the Maddox rod is placed in front of the right eye (it is done on both eyes) with the cylinder horizontal, making the red line will be vertical. The patient is then asked whether the white light is superimposed on the red line, or if it is to the left or right of the red line. 
* If the patient saw a red line to the left and white light to the right, they are said to have [[exotropia]] or exophoria (crossed [[diplopia]]) in which base in (BI) [[prism]]s of increasing strength are used until the lines are superimposed.&lt;ref&gt;Ansons, A. &amp; Davis, H. (2008). Diagnosis and Management of Ocular Motility Disorders, Third Edition. [Wiley Online Library]. {{DOI|10.1002/9780470698839}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the patient saw a red line to the right and white light to the left, they are said to have [[esotropia]] or esophoria (uncrossed [[diplopia]]) in which base out (BO) [[prism]]s of increasing strength are used until the lines are superimposed.&lt;ref&gt;Ansons, A. &amp; Davis, H. (2008). Diagnosis and Management of Ocular Motility Disorders, Third Edition. [Wiley Online Library]. {{DOI|10.1002/9780470698839}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maddox Rod Test Tutorial.webm|thumbtime=34|thumb|400px |Maddox rod test tutorial]]
Method for measuring vertical deviations:

1. The patient is held for granted to hold the Maddox Rod in front of their right with the cylinders vertical, making the red line horizontal.&lt;br/&gt;
2. The patient is then asked whether the white light is superimposed on the red line or if it appears above or below the red line. 
* If the line appears below the light, there will be a hyper-deviation in which base down [[prism]]s are used to measure and correct the deviation.
* If the line appears above the light, there will be a hypo-deviation and base up [[prism]]s are used measure and correct the deviation.
* If the white light is superimposed on the red line, there are no vertical deviations present &lt;ref&gt;Ansons, A. &amp; Davis, H. (2008). Diagnosis and Management of Ocular Motility Disorders, Third Edition. [Wiley Online Library]. {{DOI|10.1002/9780470698839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double Maddox rod test==
The double Maddox rod test can also be used to assess torsion and measure cyclotropias.&lt;ref&gt;Ansons, A. &amp; Davis, H. (2008). Diagnosis and Management of Ocular Motility Disorders, Third Edition. [Wiley Online Library]. {{DOI|10.1002/9780470698839}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maddox rod with trial frames.png|thumb|Double Maddox rod test with trial frames]]
# The room lights should be dimmed and only one light source should be visible
# Maddox rods are placed into the trial frames, one before each eye
# Cylinders are placed into trial frame vertically, making the two red lines horizontal
# Vertical prism ( base-up, or base-down) can also be added into the trial frames to separate the two red lines (This avoids confusion if the patients claim that they only see one red line). The degree of deviation and the direction (incyclo or excyclo) can be determined by the angle of rotation that causes the line images to appear horizontal and parallel. 
# The amount of cyclodeviation is measured in degrees, utilised from the scale on the trial frame
# When testing at near, the patient asked to fixate on light source at 33&amp;nbsp;cm, which is held at eye level. When testing at distance, the patient is to fixate on a light source at 6m.
# Patient is instructed to fixate on the light source with both eyes opened
# Patient is asked to rotate OR the examiner rotates the cylinders with the axis knob on the trial frame until the 2 red lines are parallel
# This test can be repeated for the secondary and tertiary positions of gaze &lt;ref&gt;Ansons, A. &amp; Davis, H. (2008). Diagnosis and Management of Ocular Motility Disorders, Third Edition. [Wiley Online Library]. {{DOI| 10.1002/9780470698839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages ==
*  Subjective test 
*  Can easily be performed 
*  Simple and fast technique 
*  Can be used on children, if they can respond reliably
*  Can be used to test eye muscle balance

==Disadvantages ==
*  Cannot be done when there are sensory anomalies present 
*  Cannot be performed if a patient has [[Suppression (eye)|suppression]], as they are unable to see the light 
*  Cannot be performed if there is [[Retinal correspondence|Abnormal Retinal Correspondence (ARC)]], as the angle of separation of the images will not correspond to the angle of deviation; defeating the purpose of the test. 
*  Cannot differentiate between tropias and phorias
*  Not suitable for the measurement of large deviations, nor for accommodation deviation as accommodation cannot be controlled with this test &lt;ref&gt;Ansons, A. &amp; Davis, H. (2008).

'''MOLST''' is an [[acronym]] for Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment.  The MOLST Program is an initiative to facilitate [[End-of-life care|end-of-life]] medical decision-making in [[New York State]], [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Ohio]] and [[Maryland]], that involves use of the MOLST form.  Most other U.S. states have similar initiatives, such as [[Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment]]. In New York state, the MOLST form is a [http://www.health.state.ny.us/ New York State Department of Health] form ([http://www.health.state.ny.us/forms/doh-5003.pdf DOH-5003]). MOLST is for patients such as a terminally ill patient, whether or not treatment is provided.&lt;ref name="2994-d"&gt;[See, [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=$$PBH2994-D$$@TXPBH02994-D+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=BROWSER+&amp;TOKEN=29103042+&amp;TARGET=VIEW N.Y. Public Health Law section 2994-d]&lt;/ref&gt;  For this example, assume the patient retains medical decision-making [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] and wants to die naturally in a residential setting, not in the [[intensive-care unit]] of a hospital on a [[ventilator]] with a [[feeding tube]].  Using MOLST, with the [[informed consent]] of the patient, the patient's doctor could issue medical orders for life-sustaining treatment, including any or all of the following medical orders: provide comfort measures ([[palliative care]]) only; do not attempt resuscitation (allow natural death); do not [[Intubation|intubate]]; do not hospitalize; no [[feeding tube]]; no [[Intravenous therapy|IV fluids]]; do not use [[antibiotic]]s; no [[dialysis]]; no [[Blood transfusion|transfusions]].  The orders should be honored by all health care providers in any setting, including [[emergency responders]] who are summoned by a [[9-1-1]] telephone call after the patient loses medical decision-making [[Capacity (law)|capacity]].&lt;ref name="DOH website"&gt;[http://www.nyhealth.gov/professionals/patients/patient_rights/molst/ New York State Department of Health MOLST web page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Advanced directives reg"&gt;[10 NYCRR § 400.21(b)(6)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== MOLST Program in New York State ==

The MOLST Program is a New York State initiative that facilitates [[End-of-life care|end-of-life]] medical decision-making.  One goal of the MOLST Program is to ensure that decisions to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment are made in accordance with the patient's wishes, or, if the patient's wishes are not reasonably known and cannot with reasonable diligence be ascertained, in accordance with the patient's best interests.&lt;ref name="2994-d"/&gt;

Patricia "Pat" Bomba, MD, has spearheaded the MOLST Program since its inception.  Dr. Bomba is a Vice President at [[Excellus Blue Cross Blue Shield|Excellus BlueCross BlueShield]].&lt;ref name="Bomba"&gt;[http://www.compassionandsupport.org/index.php/about_us/leadership Patricia A Bomba MD, FACP]&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about the MOLST Program can be found on the website that Dr. Bomba runs called www.compassionandsupport.org.

=== Legal basis in New York State ===
[[Image:The MOLST Form.JPG|thumb|upright|The MOLST Form]]

Under New York [[common law]], health care providers may withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment from a patient who is dying and currently lacks the [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] to make his or her own medical decisions if doing so is based upon [[Clear and convincing evidence#Clear and convincing evidence|clear and convincing evidence]] of the patient's wishes.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;[http://www.compassionandsupport.org/pdfs/legislation/WestchesterCountyMed%20Center.pdf ''In re Westchester County Med. Ctr. ex rel. O’Connor, 72 N.Y.2d 517'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1987, New York has had a [[Do not resuscitate|Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)]] law allowing surrogates to make decisions regarding [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] on behalf of an adult patient who lacks medical decision-making [[Capacity (law)|capacity]].&lt;ref name="laws of 1987"&gt;[N.Y. laws of 1987, chapter 818]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, the law was amended to authorize non-hospital orders not to resuscitate.&lt;ref name="laws of 1991"&gt;[N.Y. laws of 1991, chapter 370, section 17, codified in former N.Y. Public Health Law section 2977]&lt;/ref&gt;  Based upon this law, the [http://www.health.ny.gov/ New York State Department of Health] created a "standard form" to issue a non-hospital order not to resuscitate ([http://www.health.state.ny.us/forms/doh-3474.pdf DOH-3474]), which is still in use today.

In 2005, the law was amended to give the [http://www.health.ny.gov/ New York State Department of Health] authority to issue "alternative forms" for issuing non-hospital orders not to resuscitate in [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]] and [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga]] Counties.&lt;ref name="Laws of 2005"&gt;[http://image.iarchives.nysed.gov/images/images/82721.pdf N.Y. laws of 2005, chapter 734] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721061000/http://image.iarchives.nysed.gov/images/images/82721.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}, adding a subdivision (13) to former N.Y. Public Health Law section 2977]&lt;/ref&gt;  This established MOLST as a pilot program.  In 2006, the law was amended to allow such "alternative forms" to be used to issue non-hospital Do Not [[Intubate]] (DNI) orders.&lt;ref name="Laws of 2006"&gt;[http://image.iarchives.nysed.gov/images/images/79356.pdf N.Y. laws of 2006, chapter 325] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721061210/http://image.iarchives.nysed.gov/images/images/79356.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was necessary because in New York State, [[Emergency medical services in the United States|emergency medical services]] personnel may only honor a [[Do not resuscitate|DNR]] order in the event of a [[Cardiac arrest|cardiac]] or [[respiratory arrest]] and would still [[intubate]] a patient with a [[Do not resuscitate|DNR]] order unless the patient's heart or breathing has completely stopped.&lt;ref name="EMS policy"&gt;[http://www.nyhealth.gov/nysdoh/ems/pdf/11-02.pdf New York State Department of Health Bureau of Emergency Medical Services Policy 11-02]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, MOLST ceased to be a pilot program when the law was amended to authorize use of the MOLST form as a non-hospital [[Do not resuscitate|DNR and DNI]] order statewide.&lt;ref name="Laws of 2008"&gt;[http://image.iarchives.nysed.gov/images/images/139342.pdf N.Y. laws of 2008, chapter 197] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721061050/http://image.iarchives.nysed.gov/images/images/139342.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, along with passage of the [[Family Health Care Decisions Act]], the legal authority for MOLST was moved from N.Y. Public Health Law Article 29-B to a new N.Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2756">The '''mind projection fallacy''' is an [[informal fallacy]] first described by physicist and [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] philosopher [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|E.T. Jaynes]]. It occurs when someone thinks that the way they see the world reflects the way the world really is, going as far as assuming the real existence of imagined objects.&lt;ref name="PTAL"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Ninth Annual Workshop on Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods|year=1989|title= PROBABILITY THEORY AS LOGIC|author= E. T. JAYNES |url=http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/prob.as.logic.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, someone's subjective judgments are "projected" to be inherent properties of an object, rather than being related to personal perception. One consequence is that others may be assumed to share the same perception, or that they are irrational or misinformed if they do not.

A second form of the fallacy, as described by Jaynes,&lt;ref name="PTAL"/&gt; is when someone assumes that their own lack of knowledge about a phenomenon (which is a fact about their state of mind) means that the phenomenon is not or cannot be understood (a fact about reality). (See also [[Map–territory relation#"The map is not the territory"|Map and territory]].)

Jaynes used this concept to argue against [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Clearing up Mysteries--The Original Goal |year=1989 |last1=Jaynes |first1=E. T. |journal=Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods |pages=7 | url=http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the fallacy as follows:&lt;ref name="PTAL"/&gt;

{{quote|[I]n studying probability theory, it was vaguely troubling to see reference to "gaussian random variables", or "stochastic processes", or "stationary time series", or "disorder", as if the property of being gaussian, random, stochastic, stationary, or disorderly is a real property, like the property of possessing mass or length, existing in Nature. Indeed, some seek to develop statistical tests to determine the presence of these properties in their data...}}

{{quote|Once one has grasped the idea, one sees the Mind Projection Fallacy everywhere; what we have been taught as deep wisdom, is stripped of its pretensions and seen to be instead a foolish ''[[Non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]]''. The error occurs in two complementary forms, which we might indicate thus: (A) (My own imagination) → (Real property of Nature), [or] (B) (My own ignorance) → (Nature is indeterminate)}}

'''National Latino AIDS Awareness Day''' (NLAAD) ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] : ''El Dia Nacional de Concientizacion Latina del SIDA'') takes place in the United States of America and its territories on October 15, the last day of [[National Hispanic Heritage Month]], and aims to increase awareness of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ([[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]) in the Hispanic/Latino population living in the United States including [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[US Virgin Islands]]. It is a national community mobilizing and social marketing campaign co-ordinated by the [[Latino Commission on AIDS]] and the [[Hispanic Federation]] in partnership with commercial sponsors, community and public health organisations.&lt;ref name=NYTdeLeon&gt;{{cite news|last=Hevesi|first=Dennis|title=Dennis deLeon, AIDS Activist, Dies at 61.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/nyregion/15deleon.html|accessdate=9 August 2011|newspaper=[[New York Times]] online edition|date=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NLAAD_aboutus&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.nlaad.org/aboutNlaad.php|work=National Latino AIDS Awareness Day.|accessdate=9 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415115625/http://www.nlaad.org/aboutNlaad.php|archivedate=15 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National coordination, local ownership==
A National Planning Committee coordinates NLAAD, retains a national convenor and supplies participating organisations with materials such as campaign kits and with advice. Each local participating organisation organises its own activities tailored to their particular community. All aim to promote or sponsor prevention activities, including counselling and testing. Some also undertake to educate community leaders and public officials in reducing new infections and caring for Latinos living with HIV/AIDS. Some organise cultural events and celebrations. Each local group is largely responsible for raising funds for their organized activities.&lt;ref name=NLAAD_aboutus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Latino AIDS Awareness Day|url=http://llhc.info/national-latino-aids-awareness-day-nlaad/|work=Louisiana Latino Health Coalition for HIV/AIDS Awareness|accessdate=9 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525190642/http://llhc.info/national-latino-aids-awareness-day-nlaad/|archivedate=25 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===2003===
The first NLAAD was in 2003, initiated by the Latino Commission on AIDS under the leadership of [[Dennis deLeon]]&lt;ref name=NYTdeLeon/&gt; joined by the Hispanic Federation and attracted support from various community groups. In a media release announcing the event, deLeon was quoted: "AIDS has disproportionately affected Latinos whom represent 14% of the United States population (including Puerto Rico), but as a percentage of the national number of People Living with AIDS, Latinos represent a staggering 20%. ... There is no reason why Latinos should be disproportionately affected except for neglect by community leaders and government funders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Latino Leaders Respond to HIV/AIDS State of Emergency in the Hispanic Community Coalition Formed to Celebrate First National Latino AIDS Awareness Day| agency = PR Newswire| location = New York and Los Angeles | date = 10 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day was observed in more than 100 cities around the United States including New York, Miami, Los Angeles and Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Latino Leaders Join Forces to Commemorate First National Latino AIDS Awareness Day| agency = PR Newswire| location = New York | date = 10 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events around the theme ''Prevention Saves Lives'' included "proclamation ceremonies", press conferences, educational and cultural events, HIV testing and counselling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Latino Leaders From Across the Nation Declare October 15th First National Latino AIDS Awareness Day 100 Cities From Across U.S. Sponsor Programs &amp; Events to Respond to Disproportionate Impact of HIV/AIDS in Latino Community| agency = PR Newswire| location = New York | date = 15 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities included prevention education, free testing, press conferences, [[public service announcement]]s on major television networks and a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C. on 18 October 2005.&lt;ref name=PRN2005&gt;{{cite news | title = 3rd Annual National Latino Aids Awareness Day Unites Over 46 States From Coast to Coast The Last Day Of Hispanic Heritage Month Will Be Reserved To Spread The Message: 'Love Your Life, Protect Yourself, Get Tested For HIV'| agency = PR Newswire | publisher = PR Newswire Association LLC | date = 18 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rex v. Dixon''''', 3 M. &amp; S. 11 (K.B. 1814), was a case decided by the [[King's Bench]] that held that a person could not be convicted of selling impure foods unless he knew of the impurities.

The case was later overruled in ''[[Regina v. Woodrow]]'', which abolished the [[mens rea]] requirement of ''Rex v. Dixon''.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie, R.J. et al.  ''Criminal Law, Second Edition.''  Foundation Press, New York, NY: 2004, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Radium Ore Revigator''' was a [[pseudoscientific]] medical device consisting of a ceramic water [[Crock (dishware)|crock]] lined with [[radioactive]] materials.  It was [[patented]] in 1912 by R. W. Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Mullner.  ''Deadly glow: the radium dial worker tragedy''. American Public Health Association, 1999
Original from the University of Michigan {{ISBN|0-87553-245-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas was working at the time as a stock salesman in Arizona&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website | title = The Historical Collection: The Revigorator | url = https://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/quackcures/Revigator.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, by 1923, had moved to southern California to begin manufacture of his patent. In 1924, following several successful advertisement campaigns that left him unable to keep up with demand, he sold his operation to Dow-Herriman Pump &amp; Machinery Company, selling thousands of the devices in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Really Hot Drink, Centenarian Canines | url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/newscripts/88/8818newscripts.html | author = Ritter, S. | journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News | volume = 88 | issue = 18 | page = 56 | year = 2010 | doi=10.1021/cen-v088n018.p056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Revigator was intended to be filled with water overnight, which would be [[irradiation|irradiated]] by the [[uranium]] and [[radium]] in the liner, and then consumed the next day.  This was marketed as a healthy practice which could prevent illnesses including [[arthritis]], [[flatulence]], and [[senility]].
 
The Revigator contained [[carnotite]] K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  Water stored overnight in a vintage Revigator was analyzed by ICP/MS and radiation detectors.  Although the water contained higher levels of [[radon]], the health risk from radiation was low. Even so, the water contained detectable levels of [[arsenic]], [[lead]], [[vanadium]], and uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal | title = What Were They Drinking?

The case raised several legal, ethical and religious dilemmas including whether it would be permissible to kill one of the children to save the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=J.F.O. |last=Mcallister |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997967,00.html |title=Kill Mary to Save Jodie? |publisher=TIME magazine {{subscription required}} |date=2000-09-18 |accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether it was permissible to act against the wishes of the twins' parents.

==Facts==
Gracie and Rosie Attard, who were born on 8 August 2000, were [[conjoined twins]] who were joined at the abdomen.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/920487.stm |title=Jodie and Mary: The medical facts |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-12-07 |accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; During legal proceedings, the twins were given the public pseudonyms ''Jodie'' and ''Mary'', respectively.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/feb/05/sarahboseley |title=Law decided fate of Mary and Jodie |publisher=The Guardian |date=2002-02-05 |accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical evidence indicated that Gracie was the stronger sibling who was sustaining the life of Rosie. Rosie had only survived birth due to a shared common artery that enabled her sister Gracie to oxygenate blood for both twins. If surgically separated, Gracie had a 94% survival rate, but Rosie was guaranteed to die. However, if they were left conjoined, then Gracie's health—which was already rapidly deteriorating—was predicted to fail before they were six months old. Gracie's death would inevitably result in Rosie's.

==Judgment==
At first instance, Mr Justice Johnson was left to decide the case without any direct precedents to guide him&lt;ref name="hcourt1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/kirbyj/kirbyj_siamesetwins.htm |title=Siamese Twins Case Presents Serious Legal Doubts |publisher=Hcourt.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reasoned by analogy with ''[[Tony Bland|Airedale NHS Trust v Bland]]'' where it was declared acceptable to remove life support. Johnson ruled that separation would not be murder but a case of "passive euthanasia" in which food and hydration would be withdrawn.&lt;ref name="nejm1"&gt;
{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200104053441419 | title = Conjoined Twins - The Limits of Law at the limits of Life | date = 5 April 2001 | author = Annas, George | journal = New England Journal of Medicine {{subscription required}} | volume = 344 | pages = 1104–1108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeal rejected this analysis but the three judges who presided over the case gave very different legal reasoning. Lord Justice Alan Ward invoked the concept of self-defence suggesting that "If [Gracie] could speak she would surely protest, ''Stop it, [Rosie], you're killing me.''"&lt;ref name="nejm1" /&gt; Lord Justice Brooke relied upon ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'' and invoked [[defence of necessity|necessity]] as a defence. Lord Justice Robert Walker focused upon the intention of the surgeons in concluding that surgery could go ahead.&lt;ref name="hcourt1" /&gt;

===Result===
The 20-hour-long operation to separate the twins took place on 7 November 2000.&lt;ref name="bbc1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20141011/local/gozos-miracle-twin-gracie-attard-tells-her-story.539262|title=Gozo's miracle twin Gracie Attard tells her story|date=11 October 2014|work=Times of Malta|access-date=2017-07-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; As expected, Gracie survived the operation and Rosie died. Rosie's remains were later buried on the [[Malta|Maltese]] island of [[Gozo]].&lt;ref name="hcourt1" /&gt;

In 2014, when Gracie was 14 years old, she was living a reasonably normal life, had a younger sister, and was thinking about studying to become a physician.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the public authorisations given to the Red Cross of Serbia by the [[Government of Serbia]] is preparing, acting and educating people for response to disasters, armed conflicts and other emergency situations on the territory of Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crnps.org.rs/wp-content/uploads/zakon-o-crvenom-krstu.pdf] Article 5, Section 1 and 2 of the Law of the Red Cross of Serbia Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia n°107/2005&lt;/ref&gt; More than 3,000 volunteers in local branches of the Red Cross are educated for disaster response, while more than 300 of volunteers and employees were professionally trained for search and rescue in all environmental conditions. They are educated to perform specific tasks of the National disaster response teams:
* '''Team for Assessment and Coordination''' ({{lang-sr|Тим за процену и координацију/Tim za procenu i koordinaciju}} ('''ТПК/TPK''')) whose role is to assess the needs of the affected population and to coordinate the disaster response
* '''Rescue, evacuation and care during the floods''' ({{lang-sr|Спасавање, евакуација и збрињавање у случају поплава/Spasavanje, evakuacija i zbrinjavanje u slučaju poplava}} ('''СЕП/SEP''')) whole role is to participate in search and rescue and care of affected population during the floods.
* '''Rescue, evacuation and care in extreme winter conditions''' ({{lang-sr|Спасавање, евакуација и збрињавање у екстремним зимским условима/Spasavanje, evakuacija i zbrinjavanje u ekstremnim zimskim uslovima}} ('''ЕЗУ/EZU''')) whose role is to participate in search and rescue efforts during the extreme winter conditions and on high, snow covered mountains with specialised equipment such are sledges.
* '''Mobile technical team''' ({{lang-sr|Мобилни технички тим/Mobilni tehnički tim}} ('''МТТ/MTT''') whose role is to provide technical and logistical assistance to all other teams, operate technical equipment, provide water and sanitation, and set up temporary camps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.redcross.org.rs/%D1%98%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%88%D1%9B%D0%B5%D1%9A%D0%B0-%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8-%D1%86%D0%BA%D1%81/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%9B%D0%B5-%D0%B8-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%9A%D0%B5-%D1%83-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%9B%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0/%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BD%D1%83%D1%9B%D0%B0-%D0%B8-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82/] Red Cross of Serbia - Disaster response - Accomplishments and training&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rkd.jpg|250px|thumb|Badge of The Red Cross service  in the [[Swiss Armed Forces]]]]
The '''Red Cross service''' ({{lang-de|Rotkreuzdienst}}, RKD) is since 1903 a department of the [[Swiss Red Cross]]. It consists of approximately 300 women with qualified medical training in voluntary military service in support of the medical service in the [[Swiss Armed Forces]], founded by [[Henry Dunant]] Red Cross traditions.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}}

The members of the RKD (AdRKD) are divided into units, bodies of troops and staffs of the Swiss Armed Forces. They are trained by the army, equipped, used and remunerated. With few exceptions, they have the same rights and duties as the male members of the Army Medical Service. In particular, they enjoy the protection of the [[Geneva Convention]]s.

AdRKD provide refresher courses with the troops, they are under the Coordinated Medical (KSD), but may also occur in extraordinary circumstances (severe epidemics or major disaster). They wear the uniform and insignia of the Army and related income replacement. The military grade are accompanied by the words "RKD", for example "Wm RKD" for sergeant.

The management of the service holds since February 2006 Colonel RKD Brigitte Rindlisbacher.

==Qualification==
The Red Cross service accepts Swiss citizens who are between 18 and 38 years old. This requires a professional training in healthcare or in the areas of international law, education or adult education (for teaching of [[International humanitarian law]]  and [[Red Cross]] principles).

==History==
The mass internment of foreign military personnel in Switzerland, showed in the German-French war, that the civilian Swiss Red Cross (SRC) and the Swiss Army are mutually dependent.  Therefore, were private nursing training in 1903, which were under the patronage of the SRC, subsidized founds from the federal treasury.  In return, the SRC had to support the army medical service if needed at a mobilization of two thirds of its medical personnel.

Initially, only nurses were assigned to the Red Cross service. Later, women of pharmacy, medicine and alternative medicine are encouraged to join the Red Cross service. From the 2nd World War, Girl Scouts, office professional women, teachers, lawyers, etc. have been used in military hospitals, where they performed support services for the benefit of Hospital Administration.

Following his graduation in 1992, he started working at the Clinic of Stomatology at the [[First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague|First Faculty of Medicine]] and the General University Hospital in Prague, where he works today. He is also the current chief physician of the Center for Medical Photonics where he lectures in [[English language|English]].

In 1995 he passed the first postgraduate examination and in 2002 the second postgraduate examination in Stomatology. In 2002, he also obtained a [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree (CSc.). He qualified in the First Faculty of Medicine at Charles University in Prague in the field of Stomatology by presenting his thesis entitled ''The Therapeutic Use of Laser in Orofacial Oncology''. He became an [[Associate Professor]] on 1 February 2010.

He has also been working at the Faculty of Medicine, Plzeň, where he researches the possibilities of treatment of [[Oncology|oncological]] diseases with lasers.

He cooperates with the [[New York University]] College of Dentistry, and works at the Institute of Oncology and Rehabilitation Na Pleši.

He has participated in research fellowship programs in: Boston, Paris, Uppsala, Seoul, New York City and Vienna. He is a member of a range of [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and international expert associations, where he also holds various positions. These include: [[SPIE]], the American Society for Laser Medicine &amp; Surgery (ASLMS), the American Academy of Implant Dentistry (AAID), the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry (AACD), ELA, and ESAD. The chief focus of his research is the application of lasers. Among other things, since 1996 he has been working on the committee of the Czech Medical Laspi Association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.databazeknih.cz/zivotopis/roman-smucler-57603|title=Roman Šmucler životopis {{!}} Databáze knih|last=Databazeknih.cz|website=www.databazeknih.cz|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Czech Medical Association of J.E. Purkyně, where he formerly held the position of secretary for science. He has been a chair for this organization since 2013. The name was changed to the Czech Medical Laspi Association so that it could further develop the new field of [[aesthetic medicine]]. He also engages in research in the fields of [[dental implants]] and [[dentoalveolar]] surgery. To date he has published 60 original and [[wikt:Special:Search/synoptic|synoptic]] scientific papers. He has co-authored five research projects, mentors postgraduate students, and is dedicated to the popularization of science. He has written 112 articles and co-authored [[monograph]]s, as well as television and radio programs requiring his expertise. He has delivered 152 lectures, 59 of which were given abroad. In 2016 he became a member of the scientific board the IMCAS Academy ( which deals with the interface of plastic surgery and dermatology), in Paris.

==Career in media==
On 4 February 1994 he presented the first live broadcast of ''[[TV Nova (Czech Republic)|TV Nova]]'' and subsequently programs ''The Nod, Why?'', ''Tabu, 1 against 100''. He was the author of ''Tabu'', which was also screened abroad. He also appeared on programs such as ''The Golden Cage'', ''Miss of the Decade'', ''New Year's Eve Show'' and others. He left TV Nova in 2005. For six months in 2008 he accepted an offer to present the TV show ''Millionaire'' at [[TV Prima]]. In 2013, he resumed his work as a presenter for the ''Microforum Night Service'' at Czech Radio 2 and in collaboration with Czech Television he initiated preparations for the program ''The Brightest Czech''. In 2016 Czech Television aired the second season of ''The Brightest Czech''.

==Entrepreneurship==
Since 1992, he has been producing television programs under a business license. In 1996, he founded Asklepion-Lasercentrum Praha s.r.o. This company operates a non-state medical facility which has grown from the first Czech center specializing in laser aesthetic medicine into a multi-field institute of aesthetic medicine. The main clinic is in Prague with branches in [[Karlovy Vary]] and [[Mariánské Lázně]]. The company has taken part in establishing medical facilities that were later sold to other organizations ([[Prague]], [[Ostrava]]), or those that were developed primarily for other fields. About 40% of the clientele seeking treatment comes from abroad. It also runs a few surgeries abroad too, e.g. in London. Gradually other subsidiary companies specializing in business, medical training, and cosmetics production have been established. In 2008, the firm bought an equity stake in the Institute of Oncology and Rehabilitation Na Pleši, s.r.o., which had been created a year earlier through [[privatisation]]. In the same year, through Asklepion SG Hospital, s.r.o. (together with SUDOP Group – a partner of [[Asklepion]] in the Na Pleši facility) it gained a majority stake in the Municipal Hospital Mariánské Lázně, which after a few years it sold off. At present it has targeted the majority of its investments in the development of new medical procedures and products.

==Family==
He was married to Libuše Šmuclerová, the general director at Ringier Česká Republika, who was formerly the CEO at TV Nova. They are divorced. They have one daughter Justine-Anna, who was born in 2001. He remarried in 2015, his second wife is Ing. Iva Šmuclerová, successful banker HSBC associate.

==Awards==
In 2009, together with Prof. MD. Jiří Mazánek DrSc., and Dr. Marek Vlk, he was awarded the prize for medical research of 2008. He has been awarded prizes for giving speeches at foreign medical congresses and repeatedly nominated in viewer polls. In 2005, he came second in ANNO and TýTý polls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12490">'''Rural health care in Australia''' involves the delivery of health services by private, community and public hospitals in areas classified as rural and remote.&amp;nbsp;Researchers note that the health of those living in rural areas is quantitatively and qualitatively different to those living in major metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;Rickards, L. 2011, 'Rural health : problems, prevention and positive outcomes', in H. Sykes (ed.), Health, Albert Park, Vic., Future Leaders, pp.149-173,
{{ISBN|9780980332056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;These differences include often significant gaps in service delivery, accessibility and lower health outcomes.

Rural areas and those who live in them are often understood as living in a spatially, economically, socially and culturally distinct group,&lt;ref&gt;Rickards, L. 2011, 'Rural health : problems, prevention and positive outcomes', in H. Sykes (ed.), Health, Albert Park, Vic., Future Leaders, pp.149-173,
{{ISBN|9780980332056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;although there are criticisms of this perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Rickards, L. 2011, 'Rural health : problems, prevention and positive outcomes', in H. Sykes (ed.), Health, Albert Park, Vic., Future Leaders, pp.149-173,
{{ISBN|9780980332056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Despite the questions about the framing of rural and remote areas and health services as 'other' to the metropolitan norm or majority, the framing does "highlight a serious social and equity issue,"&lt;ref&gt;Rickards, L. 2011, 'Rural health : problems, prevention and positive outcomes', in H. Sykes (ed.), Health, Albert Park, Vic., Future Leaders, pp.149-173,
{{ISBN|9780980332056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;particularly the gap in access and health outcomes for rural and remote populations.

==Rural &amp; Remote Health Care&amp;nbsp;==
Rural and remote areas of Australia are classified according to a number of different schemes in relation to health care services and reporting.&amp;nbsp;

Rural areas are classified by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare as those extending from large rural centres (urban centre population 25,000-99,999) through to rural areas with an urban centre population of less than 10,000. Remote areas are classified as remote centres (urban centre population &gt; 4,999) through to those areas with less than 5,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aihw.gov.au/rural-health-rrma-classification/|title = Rural, Remote and Metropolitan Areas (RRMA) classification|date = |accessdate = January 13, 2015|website = Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|publisher = Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Commonwealth Department of Health utilises a similar classification structure called the Australian Standard Geographical Classification - Remoteness Area which was created by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Alongside its '[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/work-st-bmp-ret-dws Districts of Workforce Shortage]' data, the Department provides&amp;nbsp;[http://www.ruralhealthaustralia.gov.au/internet/rha/publishing.nsf/content/locator interactive mapping]&amp;nbsp;of the Country.

=== Rural &amp; Remote Primary Health Care ===
[[Primary health care|Primary Health Care]] (PHC) is defined by the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-reliance and self-determination."&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation, 1978: Declaration of Alma Ata, Report on the International
Conference of Primary Health Care, Alma Ata, USSR: World Health Organisation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Experts agreed that the core primary care services which should be available to those living in rural and remote communities included care of the sick and injured, mental health, maternal/child health, allied health, sexual/reproductive health, rehabilitation, oral/dental health and public health/illness prevention.&lt;ref&gt;What core primary health care services should be available to Australians living in rural and remote communities?, http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2296/15/143&lt;/ref&gt; That these communities do not have exactly same access to health and medical services - particularly specialist and rarely used services - located in metropolitan communities should not matter if they are able to readily access high quality primary health care services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.health.gov.au/internet/nhhrc/publishing.nsf/Content/16F7A93D8F578DB4CA2574D7001830E9/$File/Primary%20health%20care%20in%20rural%20and%20remote%20Australia%20-%20achieving%20equity%20of%20access%20and%20outcomes%20through%20national%20reform%20(J%20Humph.pdf|title = Primary health care in rural and remote Australia: achieving equity of access and outcomes through national reform, p3.|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that access to this basket of essential primary health care services is not adequate in rural and remote communities.&lt;ref&gt;What core primary health care services should be available to Australians living in rural and remote communities?, http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2296/15/143&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between primary health care provision and improved health outcomes is supported by "compelling international evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.health.gov.au/internet/nhhrc/publishing.nsf/Content/16F7A93D8F578DB4CA2574D7001830E9/$File/Primary%20health%20care%20in%20rural%20and%20remote%20Australia%20-%20achieving%20equity%20of%20access%20and%20outcomes%20through%20national%20reform%20(J%20Humph.pdf|title = Primary health care in rural and remote Australia: achieving equity of access and outcomes through national reform|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Australians who live in rural and remote areas experience have poorer access to primary health care services than those living in metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;What core primary health care services should be available to Australians living in rural and remote communities?, http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2296/15/143&lt;/ref&gt;

Some challenges for delivering high quality primary health care services in rural and remote locations include the need for alternative models and approaches to delivering services. Service models used in rural and remote primary health care in Australia include discrete services, integrated services, comprehensive primary health care, outreach models and virtual outreach models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wakerman J, Humphreys JS, Wells R, Kuipers P, Entwistle P, Jones J | year = 2008 | title = Primary health care delivery models in rural and remote Australia: a systematic review | journal = BMC Health Serv Res | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 276 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-8-276 | pmid = 19114003 | pmc=2642801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics&amp;nbsp;==
The&amp;nbsp;[[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare]]&amp;nbsp;(AIHW) provides statistical and other data relating to rural and remote health system performance, health status and determinants of health.&amp;nbsp;

Rural health care policy is driven by a combination of Commonwealth (Federal), State or Territory and Local Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2787230 | pmid=19956377 | volume=9 | title=Integrated primary health care in Australia | year=2009 | journal=Int J Integr Care | pages=e95 |vauthors=Davies GP, Perkins D, McDonald J, Williams A | doi=10.5334/ijic.328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council (AHMAC) Rural Health Standing Committee published a '[http://www.ruralhealthaustralia.gov.au/internet/rha/publishing.nsf/Content/EBD8D28B517296A3CA2579FF000350C6/$File/NationalStrategicFramework.pdf National Strategic Framework for Rural and Remote Health]' in 2012. This document is an agreed statement made by Health Ministers of the Commonwealth, States and the Northern Territory to identify systemic issues which require government attention and to guide future government action. The agreed statement included a 'vision' that "[p]eople in rural and remote Australia are as healthy as other Australians." It also identified access, service models and models of care, health workforce, collaborative partnership and planning at a local level and strong leadership, governance, transparency and performance as its five goals and outcome areas.&lt;ref&gt;The National Strategic Framework for Rural and Remote Health, Published by the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council (AHMAC) Rural Health Standing Committee 2012, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent statements by the&amp;nbsp;[[National Rural Health Alliance]], argue that the Commonwealth Government's introduction of a co-payment for Medicare funded primary care services will compound the already poorer access to General Practitioners which rural and remote populations already experience. In a&amp;nbsp;[http://ruralhealth.org.au/document/impact-gp-co-payment-out-pocket-health-care-costs-rural-and-remote-areas statement]&amp;nbsp;on the first proposal, it opposed the major policy change arguing that the consequences for access to primary care in rural areas would "include higher rates of potentially preventable hospitalisations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ruralhealth.org.au/document/impact-gp-co-payment-out-pocket-health-care-costs-rural-and-remote-areas|title = Impact of GP Co-Payment on Health Care Costs in Rural and Remote Areas|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = National Rural Health Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical Literature&amp;nbsp;==
The definition of 'rural health' has been criticised by researchers and health practitioners who question why the phrase ‘rural’ is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Theory in rural health|last = Farmer J, Munoz S-A, Threlkeld, G|date = 2012|journal = Australian Journal of Rural Health |doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1584.2012.01286.x|pmid = 22827425|access-date =|volume=20|pages=185–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;For them, "it implies a unified, fixed and identifiable space that is empirically unproven."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Theory in rural health|last = Farmer J, Munoz S-A, Threlkeld, G|date = 2012|journal = Australian Journal of Rural Health |doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1584.2012.01286.x|pmid = 22827425|access-date =|volume=20|pages=185–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;In particular, scholars question the accuracy of the construction of rural geographic classifications, and the links between rural classification efforts as "recent impositions of government for facilitating resource allocation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brett J | year = 2011 | title = Fair share: country and city in Australia | url = | journal = Quarterly Essay | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 1–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salivary diagnostics''' or '''Salivaomics''' is a [[Procedure (term)|procedure]] for testing and maintaining the [[data]] for [[Diagnosis|diagnostic purposes]].  Saliva based hand-held sensors are used to detect and measure proteins and nucleic acids that are present in [[saliva]] for diagnosis.  '''Salivary diagnostic''' technology is showing promise in the detection and monitoring malignancies at early stage and other various health concerns{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The advantages of '''salivary diagnostics''' includes ease of collection, elimination of [[fear of needles]], inexpensive testing and reduce risk of [[disease]] transmission between healthcare workers and patients. In addition, '''salivary diagnostic''' is fast, highly sensitive and specific, portable, user-friendly and can screen for multiple agents simultaneously{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} contributing in determining the scope of toxin exposure, thereby providing a quicker fight and diagnosis in the event of [[pandemic]], [[epidemic]] and [[bioterrorism]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

[[File:Bazellgette Sewer Network EN.svg|thumb|Map of London sewer network, late 19th century]]
'''Sewerage''' is the [[infrastructure]] that conveys [[sewage]] or [[surface runoff]] ([[stormwater]], [[meltwater]], [[rainwater]]) using sewers. It encompasses components such as receiving [[drainage|drain]]s, [[manhole]]s, [[pumping station]]s, storm overflows, and screening chambers of the [[combined sewer]] or [[sanitary sewer]]. Sewerage ends at the entry to a [[sewage treatment plant]] or at the point of discharge into the [[Natural environment|environment]]. It is the system of pipes, chambers, manholes, etc. that conveys the sewage or storm water. 

In American [[colloquialism|colloquial]] English, "sewer system" is applied more frequently to the large infrastructure of sewers that British speakers more often refer to as "sewerage".

== Components and types ==
[[File:Seattle sewer districts, 1894.jpg|thumb|Map of Seattle sewer districts, 1894]]
The main part of such a system is made up of large pipes (i.e. the sewers, or "[[Sanitary sewer|sanitary sewers]]") that convey the sewage from the point of production to the point of treatment or discharge.
[[File:Avlopp - Ystad-2018.jpg|thumb|Sewers under constrution in [[Ystad]], Sweden]]
Types of sanitary sewer systems that all usually are [[gravity sewer]]s include:
* [[Combined sewer]]
* [[Simplified sewerage]]
* [[Storm drain]]

Sanitary sewers not relying solely on [[gravity]] include:
* [[Vacuum sewer]]
* [[Effluent sewer]]

== Maintenance and rehabilitation ==
Severe constraints are applied to sewerage, which may result in premature deterioration. These include root intrusion, joint displacement, cracks, and hole formations that lead to a significant volume of leakage with an overall risk for the environment and public health. For example, it is estimated that 500 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of contaminated water per year can leak into soil and ground-water in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kaempfer, W., Berndt, M., 2009. Estimation of service life of concrete pipes in sewer networks. Durability of building materials and components, 8, 36-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The rehabilitation and replacement of damaged sewers is very costly. Annual rehabilitation costs for Los Angeles County are about €400 million,&lt;ref&gt;Sydney, R., Esfandi, E., Surapaneni, S., 1996. Control concrete sewer corrosion via the crown spray process. Water Environment Research, 68 (3), 338-347.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Germany, these costs are estimated to be €100 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kaempfer, W., Berndt, M., 1998. Polymer modified mortar with high resistance to acid corrosion by biogenic sulphuric acid. In: Proceedings of the IX ICPIC Congress, Bologna, Italy, pp.&amp;nbsp;681–687&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CES utilities 120627-F-CC568-041.jpg|thumb|Vacuuming debris from a sewer line]]
[[Hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is indirectly responsible for [[biogenic sulfide corrosion]] and consequently, sewers need rehabilitation work. Various repair options are available to owners over a large range of costs and potential durability. One option is the application of a cementitious material based on [[Calcium aluminate cements|calcium aluminate cement]], after a cleaning of the corroded structure to remove loose material and contaminants in order to expose a sound, rough and clean substrate. Depending on the concrete condition and contamination, the cleaning can range from simple high pressure jet water cleaning (200 bar) up to real hydro-demolition (2000 bars).

One method to ensure sound concrete is exposed is to verify that the surface pH is superior to 10.

As for any concrete repair, the state-of-the-art rules must be followed. After this cleaning step, the cementitious material is applied to the saturated-surface-dry substrate using either:
* Low pressure wet spray: this method is the more common because it does not produce dust and virtually no material is lost by rebound. It utilizes classical facade rotor pump, easily available in the market. The main drawback is the limited pumping distance that cannot exceed 75 meters.
* Spinning head wet spray: this method is similar to the first, but the manual spraying is replaced by a spinning head projecting the mortar onto the repaired surface. This method is fast and especially suited for cylindrical chambers such as manholes. When a structure is so severely corroded that human entry is a risk, spinning head application permits an “un-manned” consolidation of the manhole.
* High pressure dry spray: this method, also called “[[shotcrete]]” or “gunite” is allowing a faster rate of rehabilitation, and also to make a thicker application in a single pass. The main interest of dry shotcrete is the capacity to pump the mortar over a long distance and this is needed when the access points are distant. Perhaps the longest dry [[shotcrete]] distance is a job site in [[Australia]] in 2014, where 100% [[Calcium aluminates|calcium aluminate]] mortar was air transported over 800 meters before being sprayed. The main drawback with dry shotcrete is the generation of dust and rebound; these could be limited and controlled with appropriate means (pre-moisture ring, adapted aggregate grading, experienced nozzleman, water mist cut-off walls, etc.).

== Challenges ==

=== Water table ===
Sewer system infrastructure often reduces the [[water table]] in areas, especially in densely populated areas where rainwater (from house roofs) is directly piped into the system, as opposed to being allowed to be absorbed by the soil. In certain areas it has resulted in a significant lowering of the water table. In the example of Belgium, a lowering of the water table by 100 meters has been the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/politiek/1.2221951|title=Beleid tegen watertekort dringt zich op|work=deredactie.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmm.be/verrekijker/Verrekijker_juni_2007.pdf|title=Publicaties — Vlaamse Milieumaatschappij|work=vmm.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freshwater that is accumulated by the system is then piped to the sea.

In areas where this is a concern, [[Vacuum_sewer|vacuum sewers]] may be used instead, due to the shallow excavation that is possible for them.

== Regulations ==
In many [[Europe]]an countries, citizens are obliged to connect their home sanitation to the national sewerage where possible. This has resulted in large percentages of the population being connected. For example, the [[Netherlands]] have 99% of the population connected to the system, and 1% has an individual sewage disposal system or treatment system, e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[septic tank]]. Others have slightly lower (although still substantial) percentages; e.g.,&amp;nbsp;96% for [[Germany]].

'''Sightsavers''' is an international non-governmental organisation that works with partners in developing countries to treat and prevent avoidable [[blindness]], and promote equality for people with [[visual impairments]] and other [[disabilities]]. It is based in [[Haywards Heath]] in the United Kingdom, with branches in Sweden, Norway, India, Italy, Republic of Ireland, the United Arab Emirates, and the USA.

The charity was founded in 1950 by [[John Wilson (blind activist)|Sir John Wilson]] and was originally called the '''British Empire Society for the Blind''', then the '''Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind'''. Its patron is [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|HRH Princess Alexandra]]. In its 65 year history, Sightsavers has distributed treatment to protect more than 295 million people against river blindness ([[onchocerciasis]]), carried out 6.1 million sight-restoring cataract operations and treated 43 million people with antibiotics to combat the potentially blinding infection [[trachoma]].

==History==
In 1950 [[Sir John Wilson]], himself blind, set up an international organisation to help people in the world’s poorest countries see again. In its first year, the organisation (then known as the British Empire Society for the Blind) formed national organisations for blind people in six countries, initially concentrating on education, rehabilitation and welfare.

In 1953, a number of surveys were conducted in West Africa to determine the extent of the various eye conditions. These proved that 80 per cent of blindness was either preventable or curable. Along with [[trachoma]], [[onchocerciasis]] (also known as river blindness, a term coined by Sir John’s wife Lady Jean Wilson) was identified as a major cause of blindness in West Africa.

Several pioneer schemes in rural training were set up in 1955 with the aim of integrating blind people into their communities by teaching useful skills such as crop cultivation, fishing, herding and rural crafts. Sir John observed that “In economic terms the cost of blindness is astonishing. Investing in training schemes is crucial in relieving this financial strain and allowing blind people to become independent and self-sufficient.” The following year, the first eye clinics were set up in [[Nigeria]].

The changing political attitude towards Britain’s overseas territories resulted in a change of name in 1957 and organisation became known as the Commonwealth Society for the Blind. Royal status (RCSB) was conferred by the Queen a year later.

In 1960, the first mobile eye units appeared in [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]]. In 1964, the charity’s first eye camp in Asia was held at Spencer Eye Hospital in Karachi, [[Pakistan]]. Sir John recognised the potential of these camps to deliver the world’s largest sight restoring programme.

In the late 1960s an experiment was launched in Katsina, [[Nigeria]] to determine whether blind children could be educated in local schools with the assistance of itinerant teachers. The scheme proved highly successful and was the forerunner of Sightsavers’ Inclusive Education Programme.

In 1977 the first permanent base hospitals were established in India to provide low cost mass treatment. By 1980 more emphasis was being put onto local training, which was recognised as key to the success of eye health programmes. In [[Malawi]] a training course for ophthalmic assistants was set up, and this now serves much of central and southern Africa.

In 1984, [[Bhopal disaster|a gas leak in Bhopal, India]], killed up to 8,000 people and temporarily blinded many more. The RCSB was the first relief to arrive and a UK disaster appeal was launched to fund the construction of a new eye hospital to treat the injured. In 1987, [[Blue Peter]] launched its ‘Sight Savers’ appeal, raising over £2 million for eye care across Africa, and RCSB subsequently adopted the title Sightsavers. The same year, pharmaceutical company Merck released Mectizan®, trade name for [[Ivermectin]], a drug which killed the blindness-causing stage of the worms that cause [[onchocerciasis]]. Sightsavers could now begin a preventative distribution programme.

Around 1994, Sightsavers was instrumental in the development of the Comprehensive Eye Services (CES) model, incorporating screening, treatment, surgery, education and training through to rehabilitation services. The model was designed to be replicated in new regions and countries. Sightsavers also set up training courses in new surgical techniques and supported the manufacture of replacement intraocular lenses in [[India]].

In Sightsavers’ 50th year in 2000, a [[cataract]] campaign restored sight to over 400,000 people. The year also saw the launch of Vision 2020, a joint initiative with the [[World Health Organization]] and 19 international eye care organisations, including Sightsavers. Vision 2020 was created with a goal of eliminating avoidable blindness by 2020. Also in 2000, Sightsavers participated in the first World Sight Day, which is now held annually in October.

In 2012, Sightsavers led a consortium to set up the Global Trachoma Mapping Project, funded by the UK Department for International Development. The project aimed to map the prevalence of [[trachoma]] by using mobile phones to collect and transmit data to pinpoint the disease in 29 countries. The project was completed in 2016 and was the largest infectious disease survey ever undertaken&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalhealthdelivery.org/case-collection/case-studies/global/the-global-trachoma-mapping-project|title=The Global Trachoma Mapping Project|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2013, Sightsavers launched its first policy campaign, Put Us in the Picture, calling for global development to be inclusive of people with disabilities. 

In December 2017, Sightsavers celebrated its one billionth treatment for [[neglected tropical diseases]] (NTDs).

'''T-X''' (referred to as the '''Terminatrix''' in some appearances) is the name of a fictional character who appears in the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' franchise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sofge|first1=Erik|title=The Toughest, Smartest, Best Terminators of All Time|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/robots/a5586/4245140/|website=[[Popular Mechanics]]|publisher=popularmechanics.com|accessdate=29 July 2016|date=September 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The T-X model is a [[gynoid]] assassin with a human-female appearance. The character was introduced as the main antagonist in the 2003 film ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'', portrayed by [[Kristanna Loken]]. The T-X has the ability to assume the appearance of other characters; therefore, several other cast members occasionally portrayed the T-X throughout the film. This ability to shapeshift is similar to that of the [[T-1000]], the main antagonist of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.

[[File:T-X (default form).png|thumb|left|upright|T-X, in its default form.]]
The T-X was designed by [[Stan Winston]] and his studio team, where it was considered particularly challenging to design, as the script required a character capable of holding its own against the original Terminator. Originally, the T-X's [[endoskeleton]] was meant to convey an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] shape which would permit the android to assume the superficial traits of both men and women, though later designs veered on it being more feminine. The final, approved T-X design was done by Aaron Sims, who designed it entirely on computer through a mixture of [[Photoshop]] and 3D software. The T-X endoskeleton was painted chrome black, in order to differentiate it from the silver sheen of the T-850 endoskeleton, and fitted with blue running lights rather than the original's red. John Rosengrant later stated that the individual parts of the T-X endoskeleton were hard coated, sanded and polished through machines, resulting in a mathematically perfect model, unlike the endoskeleton in ''The Terminator'', which was sculpted by hand and lacked symmetry.&lt;ref name="Winston"/&gt;

The T-X is designed to not only terminate humans but also rogue Terminators reprogrammed by the Resistance, an "anti-terminator terminator" as stated by John Connor. It is a composite of the T-800 and [[T-1000]], combining the former's solid endoskeleton covered with the latter's liquid metal "[[nano technology|mimetic]] polyalloy", allowing it to take the shape of any humanoid it touches. Because it is only coated in this material, it is possible to remove it from the endoskeleton using immensely strong [[magnetic force]], such as that from a [[Particle accelerator#Circular or cyclic accelerators|cyclic particle accelerator]]. Having a solid endoskeleton did solve some of the T-1000's problems, namely being deformed by temperature extremes and explosives while also lacking built-in ranged weaponry. However, the endoskeleton makes the T-X less flexible than its T-1000 predecessor, in that the T-X does not have the ability to liquefy and assume forms in innovative and surprising ways, including fitting through narrow openings, morphing its arms into solid metal tools or bladed weapons, walking through prison bars and narrow openings, or flattening itself.

Although the official novelization of ''Terminator 2'' expanded the origin of the T-1000 and reveals it had onboard [[nanotechnology]] (and programmable memory) that was capable of scanning the [[molecular structure]] of anything the T-1000 touched, the T-X has a built-in supply of more advanced [[nanobot]]s in its fingers, which it can inject into other machines (even a less-advanced android), giving it remote control. An onboard plasma reactor powers all of the T-X's systems.&lt;ref&gt;"T-X is designed for extreme combat, driven by a plasma reactor..." ''[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/t/terminator-3-script-transcript-schwarzenegger.html (Terminator 3 Script - Dialogue Transcript)]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Loken had to gain over 15 pounds of muscle to portray the T-X. She was also trained by mime coach Thorsten Heinze, a long-time collaborator of famous mime [[Marcel Marceau]], to develop a robotic style of moving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=15 THINGS YOU PROBABLY DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES|url=http://www.ifc.com/2015/02/15-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-terminator-3-rise-of-the-machines|publisher=[[ifc.com]]|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==

===''Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines''===
The T-X is the main antagonist in ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]''. 

She was sent by [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] to the year 2004 to eliminate [[John Connor]]'s lieutenants and ensure that Skynet will rise without any interference. Among her targets is John's future wife, Kate Brewster, and her father, Robert—who is destined to become Connor's father-in-law and is Skynet's primary creator. The T-X arrives in a store, kills a woman, assumes her appearance, then steals the car and terminates three targets in the process.

When it tracks down Kate Brewster in a veterinarian hospital, it locates John Connor and makes him her primary target. As she interrogates Kate, a [[Terminator (character)|T-850]], which was sent to protect the T-X's targets, arrives and rescues John and Kate. After a chase, the T-X kills Kate's fiancé and impersonates him. It almost succeeds in killing Kate, but John and the Terminator arrive and rescue her. The T-X chases them through a cemetery, but fails to kill them.

Proceeding with its secondary mission, the T-X infiltrates the Cyber Research Systems and activates the T-1 terminator and Hunter Killer prototypes, which kills most of the employees. The T-X succeeds in killing Robert Brewster and ensuring Skynet's rise. After a tremendous fight with the T-850, it pursues John and Kate to Crystal Peak. Just as she prepares to kill them, the T-850 arrives in a helicopter and crashes into the T-X. The T-X, with her endoskeleton broken in half and revealed, crawls and pursues John. The T-850 grabs her and puts its hydrogen fuel cell in her mouth, destroying both the T-X and the T-850. Though it failed to kill John and Kate, the T-X succeeded in securing Skynet's rise.

==Novels==
===''T3: Terminator Hunt''===
In the book ''T3: Terminator Hunt'', the second known T-X is trained by captured resistance members for a jump to the 1960s where she will track the Connor family for the next forty years. A captured resistance soldier, Paul Keeley, is tricked into helping make the T-X more human. An implant in his brain causes him to think that the T-X is a girl named Eliza, and his interaction with her helps her learn how to be human. The resistance captures the T-X and rescues Keeley. But Eliza uses the implant to make Keeley think they have been captured by a rogue government, and he frees her. Overburdened with guilt, Keeley convinces John and Katherine Connor to give him another chance to capture Eliza. Through the implant, Paul discovers the training facility she has escaped to, and Eliza is again captured by the resistance and reprogrammed to serve it.

==Notes==
In the crossover comic ''[[Superman vs. The Terminator: Death to the Future]]'' (2000), there is a female Terminator called '''Terminatrix'''. However, it is never mentioned if it is a T-X or not as the comic predates the film ''Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines'' (2003).

'''''The Bridge''''' is a 2006 [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] [[documentary film]] by [[Eric Steel]] spanning one year of filming at the famed [[Golden Gate Bridge]] which crosses the [[Golden Gate]] entrance to [[San Francisco Bay]], connecting the city of [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]] to the [[Marin Headlands]] of [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], in 2004. The film captured a number of [[suicide]]s, and featured interviews with family and friends of some of the identified people who had thrown themselves from the bridge that year.

The film was inspired by a 2003 article titled "Jumpers," written by [[Tad Friend]] for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="net"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/jumpers|title=Jumpers|first=|date=October 13, 2003|work=[[The New Yorker]]|author=[[Tad Friend]]|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film crew shot almost 10,000 hours of footage, recording 23 of the known 24 suicides off the bridge in 2004.&lt;ref name="kottke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kottke.org/06/05/controversy-over-the-bridge |title=Controversy over 'The Bridge'|author=Jason Kottke|website=kottke.org|date=May 1, 2006 |accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2592841&amp;page=1&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |title=The Bridge of Death|work=[[ABC News]]|date=October 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge}}
The Golden Gate Bridge, which first opened in May 1937, was the most popular suicide site in the world during the documentary's filming, with approximately 1,200 deaths by 2003.&lt;ref name="lethal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Lethal-Beauty-The-Allure-Beauty-and-an-easy-3302966.php |title=Lethal Beauty |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |author=Edward Guthmann |date=October 30, 2005 | accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its death toll has since been surpassed only by the [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/asia-pacific/a-voice-of-reason-on-yangtze-bridge|title=A voice of reason on Yangtze bridge|author=Paul Mooney|date=July 8, 2008|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-second fall from the Golden Gate Bridge sends a person plunging {{convert|245|ft|m}} at {{convert|75|mph|km/h}} to hit the waters of the [[San Francisco Bay]] "with the force of a speeding truck meeting a concrete building." Jumping off the bridge holds a 98 percent fatality rate; some die instantly from internal injuries, while others drown or die of [[hypothermia]].&lt;ref name="lethal" /&gt;

In his article for ''The New Yorker'', Tad Friend wrote, "Survivors often regret their decision in midair, if not before," supported by survivor Ken Baldwin explaining, "I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was totally fixable—except for having just jumped."&lt;ref name="jumpers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/jumpers |title= Jumpers - The fatal grandeur of the Golden Gate Bridge|author=[[Tad Friend]]|work=[[The New Yorker]]''|date=October 13, 2003|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the city's newspapers sparked "countdowns" as the death toll closed in on 500 recorded fatalities. Television crews covered the scene as bridge officials managed to stop 14 prospective jumpers, among them a man with a sign reading "500" pinned to his T-shirt. The media frenzy was even more intense in 1995 as the total drew close to 1,000. The body of the 1,000th victim, a 25-year-old who was seen jumping, remains unrecovered.&lt;ref name="jumpers" /&gt;

Steel said he was shocked that, despite the Golden Gate Bridge's notoriety and history, nothing had been done to prevent people from attempting suicide there. "Most bridges where, or high places, if it's high enough that it would be a fatal fall, have put up [[suicide barrier]]s precisely for this reason."&lt;ref name="gma"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1900628|title=Man Survives Suicide Jump From Golden Gate Bridge|work=[[Good Morning America]]|date=April 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and film==

Steel steered clear of publicity about the project to avoid a situation where someone would "get it into his or her head to go to the bridge and immortalize him or herself on film."  The camera crew consisted of 10 to 12 people who filmed the bridge day and night in 2004, using telephoto and wide-angle cameras.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.today.com/id/12534606/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/golden-gate-suicides-film-opens-tribeca/#.VLFdEWTF9bs |title=Golden Gate suicides film opens at Tribeca |work=[[The Associated Press]]|date=May 1, 2006|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first few months of filming, the crew captured only splashes on the water and only knew someone had jumped when the Coast Guard arrived. The first jumper caught with the telephoto lens was not behaving as filmmakers expected – crying and weeping – but, rather, was jogging, talking on his cellphone and laughing; he then suddenly put his things away and leaped to his death. During filming, on average, one person jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge every 15 days.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The Times]]|title=The bridge of suicide|author=Catherine Philip|date=February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morning Fog at GGB.JPG|thumb|"The rail is so low, a 7 year old can climb over it," director Eric Steel said.&lt;ref name= "IvwPt1"/&gt;]]
The film also shows many people being saved from jumping. In one case a woman traversed the upper railing to the lower railing only to be pulled by her collar back to safety by an unrelated photographer. Filmmakers tried in each case to intercede when they could, succeeding in preventing six jumps. The crew members were trained in suicide prevention prior to filming,&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt; and had their phones programmed to call the bridge authority if they suspected someone was about to jump. "All of us came to the same conclusion that we were human beings first and filmmakers second," Steel said.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt; However, in most cases there was either no warning or no time to prevent the jump.&lt;ref name= "IvwPt1"&gt;{{YouTube|ADxUFAD6eBU|The Bridge - Director Eric Steel interview pt 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "IvwPt2"&gt;{{YouTube|mwYKs6ssYQI|The Bridge - Director Eric Steel interview pt 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A19849251 The Bridge Interview (BBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6365207.stm Director's year at suicide bridge (BBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary also features an interview with Kevin Hines, who survived his suicide attempt in 2000. As he fell toward the water, he decided that he wanted to live after all and positioned himself so he hit the water feet first. He suffered serious injuries to his spine, but his life was saved by a black seal swimming below him. He later attributed the seal's presence as a sign from God.&lt;ref name="gma" /&gt;

Steel interviewed relatives and friends of the suicide victims, but did not inform them that he had footage of their loved ones' deaths. He claimed that, "All the family members now, at this point, have seen the film, [and are] glad that they had participated in it."&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt; He filmed 120 hours of interviews.&lt;ref name= "IvwPt1"/&gt;
&lt;!-- His first name was not Eugene - see http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/gene_r_sprague_born_1969_10755875 --&gt;
Jumper Gene Sprague's life is shown throughout the film, ending with his jump into the water, shown as the last jump of the film from two opposite points.  While the film crew was filming on May 11, 2004, Sprague appeared at the Golden Gate Bridge and walked back and forth over the bridge for 93 minutes. Eventually, he climbed the railing, sat for a few seconds, then stood with his back to the water and fell motionless into the water below.
According to Steel, Sprague "walked across the bridge from the south to the north side and then from north to south, which are typically tourists. I did not think he would jump, but it must have been something about him that caught my attention."&lt;ref name= "IvwPt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "IvwPt2"/&gt;

{{quote|Why he chose the bridge? I don't know… Maybe he just wanted to fly one time.|author=Caroline Pressley, Gene's friend}}

==Controversy==

The documentary caused significant controversy when bridge officials charged Steel with misleading them about his intentions. In his permit application to the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]], a government agency that does not have any jurisdiction over the bridge but that does manage nearby park areas, Steel wrote he intended "to capture the powerful, spectacular intersection of monument and nature that takes place every day at the Golden Gate Bridge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Film-captures-suicides-on-Golden-Gate-Bridge-3313450.php |title=Film captures suicides on Golden Gate Bridge |author1=Phillip Matier |author2=Andrew Ross |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=January 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steel says he lied on his permit application because he believed he would be instantly rejected if the true scope of his project was known. He also wanted to keep the nature of the project secret in order to prevent anyone from jumping to have their deaths recorded in the documentary: "To me, the worst-case scenario was if word got out that we were filming around the clock."&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

Celia Kupersmith, CEO and general manager of the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District, said there was an increase in suicide attempts at the bridge when the documentary began appearing at film festivals and attracting publicity.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;  District spokeswoman Mary Currie called the film an "invasion of privacy."&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

Kyle Gamboa, a high school student from [[Fair Oaks, California]], skipped school in September 2013 to jump off the bridge, yelling "Yahoo!" as he leaped to his death. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported he had watched the trailer for ''The Bridge'' repeatedly. His suicide note read, "I'm happy. I thought this was a good place to end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/27/us/suicides-mounting-golden-gate-looks-to-add-a-safety-net.html |title=Suicides Mounting, Golden Gate Looks to Add a Safety Net |author=Carol Pogash|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 26, 2014|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''The Bridge'' was a box office success; from an estimated budget of $25,000,&lt;ref name="budget"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bridge (2006/I) - Box office / business|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0799954/business|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film grossed $179,780 domestically and $25,944 overseas for a worldwide total of $205,724.&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bridge06.htm | title=The Bridge (2006) | work=Box Office Mojo | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=March 11, 2007 | accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The film received mostly positive reviews and a 67% "fresh" rating from 57 reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], where the critical consensus states: "Tactlessly morbid or remarkably sensitive? Deeply disturbing or viscerally fascinating?  Critics are divided on Eric Steel's unique documentary on the Golden Gate Bridge, wonder of the modern world and [[List of suicide sites|notorious suicide destination]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1169498-bridge/ | title=The Bridge | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a 58/100 rating, signifying "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-bridge | title=The Bridge Reviews | website=Metacritic | accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Stephen Holden]] of ''The New York Times'' said the film "juxtaposes transcendent beauty and personal tragedy." He praised its simple documentary approach, noting it was "remarkably free of religious cant and of cozy [[New Age]] bromides," calling it "one of the most moving and brutally honest films about suicide ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/27/movies/27brid.html |title=That Beautiful but Deadly San Francisco Span |work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Stephen Holden]] |date=October 27, 2006 |accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Josh Rosenblatt of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' gave the film three out of five stars and wrote: "The results are striking: an emotional and aesthetic whirlpool of horror, fascination, beauty, and resignation that would probably drown lesser movies but that gives 'The Bridge' an eerie power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2007-01-26/430985 |title=The Bridge |work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|author=Josh Rosenblatt|date=January 26, 2007 |accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics condemned the film for its subject matter. ''[[The Times]]'' called it "gripping viewing but you feel like a voyeur of somebody else's pain. After a while you may feel that you're watching a particularly scenic [[snuff film]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article1385423.ece |title=The Bridge |work=[[The Times]] |date=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Pulver of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave it one out of five stars, saying it "could be the most morally loathsome film ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/16/documentary |title=The Bridge |author=Andrew Pulver |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UK Coalition of People Living with HIV and AIDS''' (UKC) was a [[United Kingdom]]-based organisation. Due to debt, it ceased operations at 5&amp;nbsp;pm on July 25, 2007.

UKC was established in 1993 as a "not for profit" organisation run by and for people living with [[HIV]]. In its original form, it was led by peers who advocated on behalf of those who most required the help. The onus was on listening to what clients required and empowering them, thus giving them the skills to face further challenges rather than allowing them to become dependent of services.

Its mission was to “to ensure the diverse voices of people living with HIV and AIDS could be heard.”

It supported people living with HIV with advocacy and advice services, and later devised an employability programme called [[Ensuring Positive Futures]] which aimed to support people living with HIV in the workplace. They shared offices and resources with the Denholm Elliot Project.

''[http://www.positivenation.co.uk/ Positive Nation]'' is an HIV and sexual health magazine, now published privately but established by the Coalition and published by them until 15 May 2007 when it had an annual readership of approximately 60,000.

UKC worked closely with [[HIV]] organisations across the [[European Union|EU]] in developing European policies and programmes, in addition to those in [[Uganda]], [[South Africa]] and [[Zambia]]. 

Its structure of HIV-positive people supporting and empowering other HIV-positive people was seen by the [[UN]] and the [[International Labour Organization]] as a useful model for HIV organisations in the developing world.

An article published on 7 September 2010 by ''Third Sector Magazine'' reported that the Metropolitan Police were currently investigating allegations of fraud at the defunct charity, and that no arrests had yet been made.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/archive/1026252/Fraud-inquiry-shut-Aids-charity/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Étang de Saint-Quentin''', or pond of [[Trappes]], with a surface of approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;km², is the largest body of fresh water in [[Yvelines]]. It on in the perimeter of the [[new town]] of Saint-Quentin-in-Yvelines, in the commune of Trappes and [[Montigny-le-Bretonneux]].  The lake an important base of outdoor recreation.  To the west of the lake a national natural reserve of 0.87&amp;nbsp;km² was established in 1986.

The Étang de Saint-Quentin is an artificial lake created by [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Sebastien Prestre, Lord of Vauban]] in 1685 to form part of an engineering work intended to feed water, by gravity, to the park of [[Gardens of Versailles|Versailles]]. The lake is 160 metres above sea level.  A series of drains and aqueducts connected the lake to other ponds upstream, and downstream to the park of the castle of Versailles, at 110 metres above sea level.  The construction of the new city demolished the aqueducts to Versailles.
