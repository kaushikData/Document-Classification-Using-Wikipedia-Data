'''André Georges Journel''' is a [[French American]] [[engineer]] who excelled in formulating and promoting [[geostatistics]] in the [[earth sciences]] and [[engineering]], first from the [[Centre of Mathematical Morphology]] in [[Fontainebleau]], France and later from [[Stanford University]].

==Education==
*D.Sc., [[University of Nancy]], [[Applied Mathematics]], 1977
*M.S2., [[University of Nancy]], [[Doctor of Engineering]], 1974
*B.Sc., [[École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Nancy]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Mining Engineering]], 1967

==Early professional career in France==
André joined the [[Paris School of Mines]] research group at Fontainebleau, under the direction of [[Georges Matheron]], as a Mining Project Engineer in 1969, moving to Head of Research four years later.  He remained active primarily teaching courses,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saimm.co.za/news/398-memories-of-danie-krige-geostatistician-extraordinaire&lt;/ref&gt; doing consulting work for mining companies around the world, and simultaneously formulating new methods often to solve pressing problems.

==Second stage at Stanford University==
Journel accepted a position as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Applied Earth Sciences in 1978.  The physical relocation was shortly followed by a reorientation of his research from mining to [[petroleum engineering]].  He was promoted to full professor in 1986 and within the year appointed Chairman of the Department, serving for a period of 6 years.  He was the mentor of several generations of students and enthusiastic promoter of joint research with industry through the Stanford Center for Reservoir Forecasting that he founded also in 1986, remaining as its Director until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://pangea.stanford.edu/researchgroups/scrf/&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his numerous research interest and accomplishments, it is worth mentioning his contributions to non-parametric geostatistics,&lt;ref&gt;André G.

In Genesis, it is used somewhat interchangeably with the names ''[[Paddan Aram]]'' and ''[[Haran (biblical place)|Haran]]'' to denote the place where [[Abraham]] stayed briefly with his father [[Terah]]'s family after leaving [[Ur of the Chaldees]], while ''en route'' to [[Canaan]] (Gen. 11:31), and the place from which later patriarchs obtained wives, rather than marry daughters of Canaan.

==Location and etymology==
Both [[Josephus]] and the [[Septuagint]] translate the name as ''Mesopotamia''. Ancient writers later used the name "Mesopotamia" for all of the land between the [[Tigris]] and Euphrates. However, the usage of the Hebrew name "Aram-Naharaim" does not match this later usage of "Mesopotamia", the Hebrew term referring to a northern region within Mesopotamia.

The translation of the name as "Mesopotamia" was not consistent - the Septuagint also uses a more precise translation "Mesopotamia of Syria" as well as "Rivers of Syria".

The '''Azraq Wetland Reserve''' is a [[List of nature reserves in Jordan|nature reserve]] located near the town of [[Azraq, Jordan|Azraq]] in the eastern desert of [[Jordan]]. An oasis for migratory birds, Azraq was established in 1978 and covers {{convert|12|km2|sqmi|1}}. The natural springs dried up in 1992 and most migratory birds subsequently moved away from the area. Artificial springs are maintained today in order to keep the site a tourist destination.

==History==
The wetlands were created some 250,000 years ago&lt;ref name=historyposter&gt;[[:File:Azraq history poster.jpg|Poster]] in the Azraq museum.&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of being fed by aquifers that corresponded with geological changes.&lt;!--what has been garbled here?--&gt; [[Azraq, Jordan|Azraq]] has, since ancient times, been the crossroads of both human trade routes and bird migrations.&lt;ref name="tradeposter"&gt;[[:File:Azraq Trade info.jpg|Poster]] in the Azraq museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of cubic meters of freshwater attracted camels caravans&lt;ref name="roughguide"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rough Guide to Jordan|author=Matthew Teller|publisher=Rough Guides 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; carrying spices and herbs traveling between [[Arabia]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=historyposter/&gt; Millions of migrating birds stopped in Azraq between [[Africa]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="tradeposter"/&gt; However, in the 1960s, water began to be pumped to support [[Amman]]'s booming population.&lt;ref name="roughguide"/&gt; In 1978, the [[Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature]] established Azraq as a wetlands reserve.&lt;ref name=rscn&gt;{{cite web|title=Azraq Wetlands Reserve|url=http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/AzraqWetlandReserve/tabid/98/Default.aspx|accessdate=2008-04-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624104203/http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/AzraqWetlandReserve/tabid/98/Default.aspx|archive-date=2008-06-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1992, however, the springs dried up,&lt;ref name="roughguide"/&gt; and the [[aquifers]] that had once gushed ceased to provide. All the water buffalos of Azraq died, and many migrating birds went to the [[Sea of Galilee]] instead.&lt;ref name="roughguide"/&gt;

==Azraq today==
The Azraq wetlands have been described as in the state of "ecological collapse".&lt;ref name="roughguide"/&gt; RSCN continues to fight an uphill battle against rising population and a growing demand for water.&lt;ref name="roughguide"/&gt; The {{convert|10000000|m3|cuft|0}} of water per year provided by the Jordanian Ministry of Water to maintain Azraq is only sufficient to restore Azraq to 10% of its original size.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Azraq 10 percent poster.jpg|Poster]] in the Azraq museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are more than 500 illegal wells still pumping water from Azraq.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Azraq illegal wells poster.jpg|Poster]] in the Azraq museum.&lt;/ref&gt; In just 37 years the numbers of migrant birds have reduced from 347,000 on February 2, 1967 to 1200 birds on February 2, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Azraq birds number poster.jpg|Poster]] at the Azraq museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Azraq provides drinking water for one-quarter of [[Amman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Azraq drinking water poster.jpg|Poster]] in the Azraq museum.&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|25|km2|sqmi}} once covered by wetlands have now dried up.&lt;ref name=rscn/&gt;

==Accommodation==
RSCN maintains an Azraq Lodge several kilometers away from the wetlands&lt;ref name="roughguide"/&gt; which features a gift shop, restaurant, 16 rooms in a 1940s British military hospital,&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt; and a reception area.[[File:Azraq reception.jpg|The reception area at the Azraq Lodge.|thumb]]

==Trails and activities==
[[File:Azraq marsh trail.jpg|thumb|The Azraq Marsh Trail.|left]] The Marsh Trail is a raised platform going through the reserve that is approximately {{convert|1.5|km|mi|2}}.&lt;ref name=brochure&gt;{{cite book|title=Azraq Wetlands Reserve &amp; Lodge brochure|publisher=RSCN/Wild Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sections of the trail are on land going through the reeds. Halfway through the trail is the mud-brick "rustic bird hide", overlooking one of the reserve's lagoons, which is used for bird watching
.&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt;

==Wildlife==
Migratory birds come from [[Anatolia]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Siberia]], and [[Africa]], stopping in Azraq during the long journey.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Map in Azraq museum.jpg|Map]] in the Azraq museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The partial restoration of the wetlands by RSCN have resulted in the return of several migratory species, such as the [[hoopoe lark]], [[Cetti's warbler]], the [[desert finch]], and the [[marsh harrier]].&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt; Among the 280 recorded migratory species in Azraq are the [[ruff]], [[avocet]], [[little stint]], and the [[little ringed plover]].&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt; Additionally, several birds of prey stop in Azraq, such as the [[European honey buzzard]] and [[Montagu's harrier]].&lt;ref name=brochure/&gt;

===Prehistoric Wildlife===
From ancient times, Azraq, ecologically, was a continuation of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Azraq slice of africa.jpg|Poster]] at the Azraq museum.&lt;/ref&gt; In this time period, many animals often characterized as [[Africa]]n lived in Azraq.&lt;ref name=prehistoricwildlife&gt;[[:File:Azraq former species.jpg|Poster]] at the Azraq Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these species were the [[Syrian wild ass]], wild [[camel]], [[rhinoceros]], [[hippopotamus]], [[Asian elephant]], [[gazelle]], [[aurochs]], [[Asiatic cheetah]], [[Syrian ostrich]], [[Asiatic lion]], and [[Arabian oryx]].&lt;ref name=prehistoricwildlife/&gt; All of these animals, except the gazelle, are now [[extinct]] in Azraq, and Jordan alike.&lt;ref name=prehistoricwildlife/&gt;

[[File:Canalbeagle.png|right|400px|thumb|Beagle Channel, from the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].]]

'''Beagle Channel''' ({{Lang-es|Canal Beagle}}) is a [[strait]] in [[Tierra del Fuego|Tierra del Fuego Archipelago]] on the extreme southern tip of [[South America]] between [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Zagier, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The channel separates the larger main island of [[Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego]] from various smaller islands including the islands of [[Picton, Lennox and Nueva]]; [[Navarino Island|Navarino]]; [[Hoste Island|Hoste]]; [[Londonderry Island|Londonderry]]; and [[Stewart Island (Chile)|Stewart]]. The channel's eastern area forms part of the border between Chile and Argentina and the western area is entirely within Chile.

The Beagle Channel, the [[Straits of Magellan]] to the north, and the open-ocean [[Drake Passage]] to the south are the three navigable passages around South America between the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s. However, most commercial shipping uses the open-ocean Drake Passage.

The Beagle Channel is about {{convert|240|km|nmi mi}} long and is about {{convert|5|km|nmi mi|0}} wide at its narrowest point. It extends from [[Isla Nueva|Nueva Island]] in the east to [[Darwin Sound]] and [[Bahía Cook|Cook Bay]] of the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west.  Some {{convert|50|km|nmi mi|0}} from its western end it divides into two branches, north and south of [[Gordon Island]].  The southwest branch between Hoste Island and Gordon Island enters Cook Bay. The northwest branch between Gordon Island and Isla Grande enters Darwin Sound connecting to the Pacific Ocean by the O'Brien Channel and the [[Ballenero Channel]]. The biggest settlement on the channel is [[Ushuaia]] in Argentina followed by [[Puerto Williams]] in Chile. These are two of the [[southernmost settlements]] of the world.

Although it is navigable by large ships, there are safer waters to the south ([[Drake Passage]]) and to the north ([[Strait of Magellan]]).&lt;ref name="Laudy"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Mark | last = Laudy | editor1-last = Greenberg | editor1-first = Melanie C. | editor2-last = Barton | editor3-last = McGuinness | editor3-first = Margaret E. | contribution = The Vatican Mediation of the Beagle Channel Dispute: Crisis Intervention and Forum Building  | title = Words Over War:Mediations and Arbitration to Prevent Deadly Conflict| year = 2000 | pages = | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | location = Lanham, Md. | isbn = 978-0-8476-9893-6 | editor2-first = John H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]], ships of other nations navigate with a Chilean [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] between the [[Strait of Magellan]] and [[Ushuaia]] through the [[Magdalena Channel]] and the [[Cockburn Channel]] to the Pacific Ocean, then by the Ballenero Channel, the O'Brien Channel and the northwest branch of the Beagle Channel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/CHL-ARG1984PF.PDF ''Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1984'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islands==
The Beagle Channel develops between several islands; to the north lies Argentine-Chilean [[Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego]], to the south [[Hoste Island|Hoste]], [[Navarino Island|Navarino]], and [[Picton, Lennox and Nueva|Picton and Nueva]], which were claimed by Argentina until 1984. The latter two lie at the bi-national eastern entrance to the channel while the western entrance is wholly inside Chile. The western entrance of Beagle Channel is divided by [[Gordon Island]] into two channels. Some minor islands exist inside the channel among them [[Snipe incident|Snipe Islet]] and [[Gable Island]]. Except for eastern Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego and Gable Island all islands mentioned here belong to Chile.

==History==
{{see also|Tierra del Fuego gold rush}}
[[File:HMS Beagle by Conrad Martens.jpg|thumb|right|[[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] at Ponsonby Sound in the Beagle Channel, by [[Conrad Martens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=259 227]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
The [[Yaghan]] peoples settled the islands along the [[Murray Channel]] approximately 10,000 years before present. There are notable [[archaeological]] sites indicating such early Yaghan settlement at locations such as [[Bahia Wulaia]] on [[Isla Navarino]], site of the ''Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens''.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming and Darwin visit===
The channel was named after the ship [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] during its first [[hydrographic survey]] of the coasts of the southern part of South America which lasted from 1826 to 1830. During that expedition, under the overall command of Commander [[Phillip Parker King]], ''Beagle'''s captain [[Pringle Stokes]] committed suicide and was replaced by captain [[Robert FitzRoy]]. The ship continued the survey in the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of ''Beagle'']] under the command of captain FitzRoy, who took [[Charles Darwin]] along as a self-funding [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]], giving him opportunities as an amateur [[naturalist]]. Darwin had his first sight of [[glacier]]s when they reached the channel on 29 January 1833, and wrote in his field notebook  "It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more beautiful than the beryl-like blue of these glaciers, and especially as contrasted with the dead white of the upper expanse of snow."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin, Voyage of the Beagle (New York: Collier, 1909), chapter 10, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=glaciers&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=A345&amp;pageseq=2 |title=An 1830s View from Outside Switzerland: Charles Darwin on the "Beryl Blue" Glaciers of Tierra del Fuego |author=Herbert, Sandra |year= 1999 |format= |work= |publisher=Eclogae Geologicae Helvetiae |pages=92, 339–46 |accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beagle Conflict===
Several small islands ([[Beagle Channel cartography since 1881|Picton, Lennox and Nueva]]) up to the [[Cape Horn]] were the subject of the long-running [[Beagle conflict]] between Chile and Argentina; by the terms of a [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]] they are now part of Chile.&lt;ref name="Laudy" /&gt; From the 1950s to 1970s several incidents involving the Chilean and Argentine Navy occurred in the waters of the Beagle Channel, for example the 1958 [[Snipe incident]], the 1967 ''Cruz del Sur'' incident and the shelling of ''Quidora'' the same year. See [[List of incidents during the Beagle conflict]].

==Fauna==
Beagle Channel is a prominent area to watch rare, endemic dolphins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scotia Sea: Part 5. The Great Marine Mammals |url=http://www.vulkaner.no/n/vlad/escotia5.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the less-studied [[pygmy right whale]]s.

'''Bernouilli Conservation Reserve''' is a [[protected area]] located in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] in the gazetted locality of [[Cape Jaffa, South Australia|Cape Jaffa]] about {{convert|21|km|abbr=off}} south west of the township of [[Kingston SE, South Australia|Kingston SE]] in the state's [[Limestone Coast]] region.  The conservation reserve was proclaimed under the ''Crown Land Management Act 2009'' in 1993.  The name is derived from Cap Bernouilli, the former name of the headland of [[Cape Jaffa]].  The conservation reserve is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category VI – Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources|Category VI protected area]].&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum&gt;{{cite web|title=CAPAD 2012 South Australia Summary (see 'DETAIL' tab)|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/0f927a4e-336a-490c-a896-ec37874a5c73/files/capad2012sa.xlsx|work=CAPAD 2012|publisher=Australian Government - Department of the Environment|accessdate=6 February 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boxen''' is a [[fictional world]] that [[C. S. Lewis]] ("Jack") and his brother [[Warren Lewis|W. H. Lewis]] ("Warren") created as children.  The world of Boxen was created when Jack's stories about Animal-Land and Warnie's stories about India were brought together.  In ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'', Jack explains that the union of Animal-Land and India took place "sometime in the late eighteenth century (their eighteenth century, not ours)".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C.S., ''Surprised by Joy'', 1955, Chapter V.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a time when [[influenza]] was ravaging many families, the Lewis brothers were forced to stay indoors and entertain themselves by reading. They read whatever books they could find, both those written for children and adults. Influenced by [[Beatrix Potter]]'s animals, C.S. Lewis wrote about Animal-Land, complete with details about its economics, politics/government, and history, as well as illustrations of buildings and characters.

The stories were published posthumously as ''Boxen: The Imaginary World of the Young C. S. Lewis'' Edited by Walter Hooper and first published by London: Collins May 28, 1985.  First American edition: San Diego: Harcourt, Brace, Javanovich, October 17, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;In Pursuit of C. S. Lewis by Edwin W. Brown, M. D., Indianapolis: Proleptikos Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  (republished as ''Boxen: Childhood Chronicles Before Narnia'').

[[File:People's Republic of China Vietnam Locator.png|thumb|upright=1.2|China (green) and Vietnam (orange)]]

The border between China and Vietnam is the line that limits the territories of [[China]] and [[Vietnam]].

==Geography==
[[File:Confluence of Red River and Longbao River - P1380251.JPG|thumb|The confluence of the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] and the Longbao River is the northernmost point of the border section of the Red River]]
The land border measures about {{Convert|1281|km||abbr=on}}. It starts at the [[Tripoint]] with [[Laos]] , and goes to the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] , passing in essentially mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities. Whilst both sides agree on land borders, the territorial dispute over the [[Spratly]] and [[Paracel Islands]] has left maritime borders between the two nations undefined.

In several areas, the land border between the two countries runs along rivers. In particular, the border follows the  [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] on its section from the mouth of the [[Longbao River]] (near Wudaokou village in [[Hekou Yao Autonomous County|Hekou County]]) to the mouth of the [[Nanxi River (Yunnan)|Nanxi River]] (between downtown [[Hekou Yao Autonomous County|Hekou]] and [[Lào Cai]]. The lower sections of the Longbao and Nanxi are border rivers as well.

==History==
The border between China and Vietnam (which then part of [[French Indochina]]) was demarcated pursuant to the [[Treaty of Tientsin (1885)]], after the end of the [[Sino-French War]].

During the Chinese Civil War, China used the border near Vietnam as a refueling station while also giving aid to the Vietnamese who were fighting the French in the First Indochina War.

==Border crossings==
[[File:Red River south of Wudaokou - P1380257.JPG|thumb|The Red River forming the international border, between Wudaokou and Hekou]]
A number of crossing points for vehicular and pedestrian traffic operate on the border. There are two railway crossings: between Hekou and Lào Cai (where the narrow-gauge [[Kunming–Hai Phong Railway]] crosses the Nanxi River over a bridge), and between [[Pingxiang, Guangxi|Pingxiang]] and [[Đồng Đăng]] ([[Friendship Pass]]), where standard-gauge trains can cross the border on the Nanning-Hanoi line.

'''Comanagement''', also called '''community-based management''', '''community-based resource management''', '''cooperative management''', '''joint management''', and '''collaborative management''', in the broadest terms refers to the administration of a particular place being shared between two entities.  In Canada, it usually refers to agreements between government agencies and representatives of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]] to jointly make [[land use]] and [[resource management]] decisions about a tract of [[Crown land|government-controlled land]] or a [[fishery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afn.ca/uploads/files/env/comanagement_definitions_guide.pdf|title=ASSEMBLY OF FIRST NATIONS Co-Management Definitions Guide|accessdate=August 1, 2014|format=PDF|publisher=[[Assembly of First Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=Co-management has come to mean institutional arrangements whereby governments and Aboriginal entities (and sometimes other parties) enter into formal agreements specifying their respective rights, powers and obligations with reference to the management and allocation of resources in a particular area of crown lands and waters.|source=[[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]], 1997}}

[[Parks Canada]] co-manages several Canadian national parks with local Aboriginals has the result of land claims agreements.  [[Ivvavik National Park]] in the Yukon was created in 1984 and is part of the [[Inuvialuit Final Agreement]].  Likewise, the [[Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement]] dictates co-management of [[Torngat Mountains National Park]] in Labrador, created in 2005.  Proposals for new parks, such as [[Thaydene Nene National Park (proposed)]] in the Northwest Territories typically involve some kind of negotiations over co-management.  Not only national parks, but also provincial ones also are subject to co-management; the [[Hay-Zama Lakes]] wetlands complex in Alberta is an example.  A separate but related phenomenon is the joint management of parks by two governments without an Aboriginal partner.  For example thefederal government and a province can jointly manage a park such as the [[Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park]] in Quebec, as can two provinces such as [[Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park]] in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

The [[West Coast of Vancouver Island Aquatic Management Board]] is an example of co-management in fisheries.  It consists of two members appointed by each of the Government of Canada, Province of British Columbia, the [[Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council]], the [[regional districts]], as well as eight non-government members jointly appointed by the levels of government from the wider community.

The '''Dufourspitze''' is the highest peak of [[Monte Rosa]], a huge ice-covered mountain massif in the [[Alps]]. Dufourspitze is the [[List of mountains of Switzerland|highest mountain peak]] of both [[Switzerland]] and the [[Pennine Alps]] and is also the [[List of mountains of the Alps|second-highest mountain]] of the [[Alps]] and Europe outside the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]]. It is located between [[Switzerland]] ([[Canton of Valais]]) and [[Italy]] ([[Piedmont]] and [[Aosta Valley]]).

Following a long series of attempts beginning in the early nineteenth century, Monte Rosa's summit, then still called ''Höchste Spitze'' ({{lang-en|Highest Peak}}), was first reached on 1 August, the Swiss National celebration day, in 1855 from Zermatt by a party of eight climbers led by three guides: Matthäus and Johannes Zumtaugwald, Ulrich Lauener, Christopher and James Smyth, [[Charles Hudson (climber)|Charles Hudson]], [[John Birkbeck]] and Edward Stephenson.

== Naming ==
{{see also|List of mountains of Switzerland named after people}}
[[File:Guillaume-Henri Dufour (Irminger).png|thumb|left|160px|Guillaume-Henri Dufour]]
The peak is distinguished by the name ''Dufourspitze'' (in [[German language|German]], lit. ''Dufour Peak''; {{lang-fr|Pointe Dufour}}, {{lang-it|Punta Dufour}}). This replaced the former name ''Höchste Spitze'' ({{lang-en|Highest Peak}}) that was indicated on the Swiss maps before the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]], on January 28, 1863, decided to rename the mountain in honor of [[Guillaume-Henri Dufour]]. Dufour was a Swiss engineer, topographer, co-founder of the [[Red Cross]] and army general who led the [[Sonderbund]] campaign. This decision followed the completion of the [[Topographic Map of Switzerland|Dufour Map]], a series of military topographical maps created under the command of Dufour.

The point just {{convert|80|m|abbr=on}} east of the Dufourspitze and only 2 metres lower, the [[Dunantspitze]], was renamed in 2014 in honor of [[Henry Dunant]], the main founder of the Red Cross.

==Elevation==
{{see also|List of countries by highest point|List of Swiss cantons by elevation}}
{{see also|Monte Rosa}}

The Dufourspitze of Monte Rosa is the most [[elevation|elevated]] point of [[Valais]] and [[Switzerland]], although it is not the most [[topographic prominence|prominent]] of the country, that distinction belonging to the [[Finsteraarhorn]], nor the most [[topographic isolation|isolated]], that distinction belonging to [[Piz Bernina]]. The [[Cartography of Switzerland|Swiss national map]] gives an elevation of {{convert|4634.0|m|ft|1}} for the summit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://s.geo.admin.ch/0208efdff The geoportal of the federal authorities of the Swiss Confederation (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; which is 4,441 metres above [[Lake Maggiore]], Switzerland's lowest point. The height difference between the summit and the plains of northern Italy, from where Monte Rosa is well visible, reaches over {{convert|4500|m|-3}}.&lt;!--South of Milan, the river Po is below 60 m--&gt; Monte Rosa has a [[topographic prominence]] of {{convert|2165|m|abbr=on}}, the [[Great St Bernard Pass]] being the lowest col between it and the culminating point of the Alps.

Though the Mediterranean can hardly be visible from the summit of Monte Rosa because of intervening mountains, the view to the south extends to the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], the mountains of [[Corsica]] and the [[Maritime Alps]]. On the north side the view extends to the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]] and further to the [[Vosges]],&lt;!--The Black Forest is entirely hidden--&gt; the [[Swiss Plateau]] being mostly hidden by the high range of the [[Bernese Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hinchliff, after reaching the summit of Monte Rosa in 1856, described the panorama (Hinchliff, ''Summer months among the Alps: with the ascent of Monte Rosa'', pp. 127–132):
:"Not a cloud defaced the gigantic panorama before us: the fair land of Italy commenced at our feet, and stretched far and far away till the view was only bounded by the obscurity of distance. Sitting at the very edge of the vast precipices which descend about 12,000 feet right down to the head of the Val d' Anzasca, we were at the end and extremity, as well as the summit, of the wild kingdom of rocks and snow; and a new world of verdure and cultivation was suddenly spread out before our eyes. The green plains of Lombardy and Sardinia, faintly tinged with blue by distance, and studded with innumerable towns and villages, some of which only looked like white specks of various sizes, fatigued the eye in the endeavour to comprehend their magnitude: all that we could do was to seize upon the most salient points of the picture, and fix them for ever on our minds."

:"Comparatively in the foreground were the lakes of Maggiore, Lugano, and Como; for though the head of the latter is eighty miles in a direct line from Monte Rosa, it was not even dimmed by the haziness of distance: all around these beautiful lakes was fresh and verdant; and, as we looked at the somewhat long and narrow pond which we knew to be Lago Maggiore, it was indeed difficult to believe that the journey down its lovely surface was in reality about as long as that from London to Brighton. Lower down, and seemingly but a short distance from the foot of the lakes, was a city in which we thought we could perceive a shining white mound that we felt to be what Tennyson calls "a mount of marble, a hundred spires" — the far-famed cathedral of Milan. Turning slowly to the right, the eye passed over an immense extent of seemingly plain country, and took in almost at a glance the whole continental possessions of the king of Sardinia, with the vast chain of Alps stretching from Mont Blanc to the Mediterranean. This chain presented a very beautiful serrated outline, in which the higher tops of Mont Cenis and Monte Viso were conspicuous, and terminated abruptly at the southern extremity on the edge of the sea. I could not distinctly assert that we really saw the Mediterranean, for the distance is so enormous that it becomes impossible to distinguish the horizontal line which separates the sky from the water: but judging from the perfect clearness with which we saw the very end of the Maritime Alps, and from the fact that the Apennines were not high enough to appear noticeable in the view, it is undoubtedly certain that our true horizon must have included part of the Gulf of Genoa, though the similarity of tint at so immense a distance made it impossible to say which was sky and which was water. Still turning farther to the right, a change came o'er the fashion of our dream: farewell to the fertile green and purple tinted plains of Italy! The Titans of the mountain world once more confront our sight; and here, close in front, separated from us by a vast gulf of snow crevassed into every fantastic variety of form, rises the nearest of them, the Lyskamm. Even while we were looking at it, there came the roar of a few hundreds of tons of ice thundering down its precipitious side, as if a great frozen giant had tumbled out of bed, and was waking the mountain echoes with his groaning."

:"A little beyond this came the Breithorn, now so much below us that we could look down upon its splendid white head, high over which Mont Blanc and all its dependencies were seen with perfect clearness, though the distance of sixty miles had so reduced the apparent size of this large group, that it was only just long enough to cover the summit of the nearer mountain. The Matterhorn had lost that unique grandeur of isolation which gives it so wonderful an appearance when seen from below, and was now backed up by countless peaks and glaciers of the almost untrodden land, only made known by Studer and Professor Forbes, which extends from the neighbourhood of Zermatt to that of St. Bernard and the Combin, beyond which again some of the highest summits of France were visible. The Gorner glacier with all its ramifications was laid out like a map beneath our feet as far as the Cervin pass and the foot of the Matterhorn; and scores of the smaller glaciers shone with nearly all the colours of the rainbow in their various beds, according as their position and inclination affected the dazzling light that fell upon them."

:"The rocks beneath whose shelter we were entrenched prevented us from seeing the view towards the north till we rose to our feet again; and then in an instant nearly the whole of Switzerland was added to the vast panorama! Near us, and only separated by a ridge, was the Nord end of Monte Rosa, the only one of the points which remains unsealed: but though the last part of it would no doubt be very difficult, I should not think it is altogether unattainable. Further to the north, we had an admirable view of the two great ranges which enclose the valley of the Gorner Visp, that to the west culminating in the Weisshorn, and that to the east in the Dom or Grabenhorn, the highest point of the Mischabel. The last was, as far as we could judge, quite as high as the point we stood upon, and the slopes of rock and snow which lead to its sharp-pointed summit appeared to be inclined at so terribly steep an angle as to present a most formidable difficulty- to the climber. The Weisshorn forms a magnificent star amid the constellation of mountains around Zermatt, and is about 15,000 feet high: seen from Monte Rosa its peak is remarkably like that of the Dom."

:"Far beyond these, and seen through a wide gap between the Dom and the Mittaghorn, shone the Jungfrau, queen of the Oberland, tinged with the same delicate yellowish shade that I had already observed on Mont Blanc: the Finsteraarhorn and many a well-known summit looked at us from afar like old friends; and yet further to the east, group after group of distant mountains, some of which must have been looking down upon the tranquil waters of Lucerne, were followed by the Tyrolese ranges, many of them far beyond the Ortler Spitze, where, at a distance of 200 miles, they displayed their snowy heads all tinged with a rosy light, though we had only arrived at the middle of the day. Thus we observed a regular gradation of colour on the snows, varying in proportion to their distance. Such was the sublime view which we had the rare fortune to enjoy."

== History ==
{{see also|Exploration of the High Alps}}

=== Early exploration ===
Monte Rosa could be seen from many places on the south side of the Alps and it had been mentioned in many travel diaries. At the end of the 15th century some outlines of the mountain may possibly have been painted by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] into the background of the [[Madonna of the Rocks]] or other pictures. Da Vinci explored the Italian side of the mountain and made some observations, though there is but scanty evidence that he had climbed even a minor summit in the neighbourhood. He was intringued by the permanent snow lying on the mountain and the darkness of the sky above him, he wrote:&lt;ref name = Engel&gt;Claire Eliane Engel, ''A History of Mountaineering in the Alps'', p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The base of this mountain gives birth to the 4 rivers which flow in four different directions through the whole of Europe. And no mountain has its base at so great a height as this, which lifts itself above almost all the clouds; and snow seldom falls there, but only hail in the summer, when the clouds are highest. And this hail lies [unmelted] there, so that if it were not for the absorption of the rising and falling clouds, which does not happen more than twice in an age, an enormous mass of ice would be piled up there by the layers of hail, and in the middle of July I found it very considerable; and I saw the sky above me quite dark, and the sun as it fell on the mountain was far brighter here than in the plains below, because a smaller extent of atmosphere lay between the summit of the mountain and the sun."&lt;ref&gt;{{ws|"[[s:The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci/XVII|The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci]]" (Note 1060)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MteRosa 17000.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the [[Lysjoch]] area from the south]]
At the end of the eighteenth century, the people of the Italian valleys believed that a lost valley existed, hidden away between the glaciers of the great chain. The discovery of the valley was due to Joseph Beck of [[Gressoney-Saint-Jean]]. He put together a party, including his brother Valentin, and the Gressoney mountain guides Sebastian Linty, Joseph Zumstein, Nicolas (Niklaus) Vincent, François Castel and Étienne Lisco. They set out on a Sunday of August 1778. They started from their sleeping places at midnight, and roped carefully. They had furnished themselves with climbing irons and alpenstocks. At the head of the glacier, they encountered a slope of rock devoid of snow, which they climbed.&lt;ref name = Lunn&gt;[[Arnold Lunn]], ''The Alps'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;
:"It was twelve o'clock. Hardly had we got to the summit of the rock than we saw a grand-an amazing-spectacle. We sat down to contemplate at our leisure the lost valley, which seemed to us to be entirely covered with glaciers. We examined it carefully, but could not satisfy ourselves that it was the unknown valley, seeing that none of us had ever been in the Vallais."

The valley, in fact, was none other than the upper [[Mattertal|valley of Zermatt]], and the pass, which these early explorers had reached, was the [[Lysjoch]], where, to this day, the rock on which they rested bears the name that they gave it, the "[[Entdeckungsfels]]" (German: ''Rock of Discovery''). Beck's party thus reached a height of 4,178 metres (13,707&amp;nbsp;ft), probably a record in the Alps at that times.&lt;ref name = Lunn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On July 14, 1775, Jean-Nicolas Couteran, Francois and Michel-Gabriel Paccard and Victor Tissai may have reached a similar height while attempting to climb the [[Dôme du Goûter]] near the [[Mont Blanc]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Count Morozzo of Turin was inspired by the view of Monte Rosa and in 1787 he tried to reach its summit from the east face. However he did not go very high, and the mountain looked much too inaccessible to encourage him to proceed further. He reached the place of the actual Marinelli hut, 1,500 m below the summit. The route on the east face was opened only in 1872. In 1789, following the recommendation of the Count, [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]] went to [[Macugnaga]] to explore the mountain. He climbed [[Pizzo Bianco]], a 3215 m summit facing the mountain from the east and measured the altitude of Monte Rosa. He found a height of 2430 [[toise]]s.&lt;ref name = Engel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]], ''Voyages dans les Alpes'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

A first serious attempt was made in 1801 by a doctor of [[Alagna]], Pietro Giordani. He reached alone a great height when climbing a 4,046 metres high point on the south-east ridge of the [[Vincent Pyramid]], later named ''Giordanispétz'' or ''Punta Giordani'' in his honour. He arrived too late to proceed to the Vincent Pyramid summit and night drove him away. He had to sleep in a cleft of ice at about 14,000 feet. He wrote an account of his exploit: After an eloquent description of the view, he expresses his annoyance at the lack of scientific instruments, and the lateness of the hour which prevented him from ascending "Monte Rosa" itself.&lt;ref name = Lunn/&gt;

The 4215 m Vincent Pyramid summit was eventually successfully climbed on 15 August 1819 by Johann Niklaus and Joseph Vincent from Gressoney&lt;!--(grand)sons of the 1778 Niklaus Vincent?--&gt;, after whom the peak has been named. The brothers Vincent tried to reach the highest summit again the next year, together with Joseph Zumstein&lt;!--(grand)son of the 1778 Joseph Zumstein?--&gt;, and guides and porters. On August 1, 1820, they reached a 4,563 metres high secondary summit, later named ''[[Zumsteinspitze]]''. The climb was dangerous, as the party had to traverse under threatening walls of ice; they also had great difficulties on descent, because the afternoon sun had melted the snow on the slopes. They used mules to carry their equipment as far as the snow-line. During the expedition they thought they had climbed the true highest peak, but when they reached the summit they found out it was only a subpeak of Monte Rosa. Zumstein was anxious to return later and reach the highest summit, but his desire did not materialize.&lt;ref name = Lunn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dumler/&gt;

=== First ascents ===
[[File:MonteRosa005.jpg|thumb|The west flank and the Monte Rosa Glacier. The [[Nordend]] (left) is separated from the summit by the Silbersattel.]]
The first approaches to the summit were made from the northern slopes over the Gorner glacier via the Silbersattel (4,510&amp;nbsp;m). This pass was first reached on August 12, 1847, by Matthias and Johann zum Taugwald (guides from Zermatt whose name is also written "Zumtaugwald"), Johann Brantschen and Joseph Moser guiding the French professors Victor Puisieux and Edouard Ordinaire.&lt;ref name = Dumler&gt;Wolfgang Pusch, Helmut Dumler, Willi P. Burkhardt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5KkhAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119 Viertausender der Alpen], [[Bergverlag Rother GmbH]], 2013, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Precisely a year later (12 August 1848), [[Johann Madutz]] from [[Matt, Switzerland|Matt, Glarus]], and [[Matthias Zumtaugwald]] guided the Swiss theologian [[:de:Melchior Ulrich]] to the pass for an ascent of the highest summit. Ulrich had to give up, but the guides proceeded to climb to what they thought to be the Eastern summit of the Dufourspitze (''Ostspitze'', since 2014 [[Dunantspitze]], 4632 m) and established a new altitude record in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Since 1820 held at 4,563 m by the climbers of the [[Zumsteinspitze]].&lt;/ref&gt; The descent over the same route was so tricky that Madutz at places had to lower down Zum Taugwald by rope. Three years later, on 22 August 1851, Johann Zumtaugwald returned, with [[Peter Taugwalder]] and Peter Inderbinen and the Swiss botanist brothers [[Adolf Schlagintweit|Adolf]] and [[Hermann Schlagintweit]] to repeat this ascent. They did not dare to traverse to the western summit, which the Schlagintweits estimated to be 7 meters higher.&lt;ref name=studer&gt;[[Gottlieb Studer]], ''Über Eis und Schnee: Die höchsten Gipfel der Schweiz und die Geschichte ihrer Besteigung'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=IcksAAAAYAAJ Volume 2], Schmid, Francke &amp; Company, 1899, pp. 78–85&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, [[W.A.B. Coolidge]] analyzed these ascents and concluded that both parties had reached the 4,618 m [[Grenzgipfel]] instead, which is a mere 50 meters to the east of Ostspitze.&lt;ref&gt;Grenzgipfel was in Coolidge and Studer's time thought to be 4,631 m vs. 4,638 for both summits of the Dufourspitze, i.e. exactly 7 meters lower, which was then used to argue that the Grenzgipfel must have been reached. The current heights of 4618, 4632 and 4634 m suggest a weakness in Coolidge's argument, and modern writers like Dumler and Burkhardt assume that the 1848 and 1851 ascendants were on the Ostspitze after all.&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred the honor of first climbing the Ostgipfel to Ulrich Lauener from [[Lauterbrunnen]] and the brothers Christopher, Edmund and James G. Smyth from [[Great Yarmouth]], who reached the Ostspitze on September 1, 1854 from the Silbersattel.&lt;ref name=studer/&gt; Some sources have the Zumtaugwald brothers also among this party.&lt;ref name=Dumler/&gt; Zumtaugwald brothers returned twice more to the East summit, Johann and Matthias 10 days later (11 Sep 1854) with Edward Shirley Kennedy and Benedict Leir, and Matthias and Stephan later again with [[Edward Levi Ames]]. On these five occasions they never tried the difficult traverse to the western summit, also because the summits were both mapped as 4,638 m high at the time. Partially with the technical difficulty ([[UIAA climbing grades|UIAA]] III) of the route from Silbersattel in mind, many consider the Madutz and Zumtaugwald ascent in 1849 the true first ascent of Monta Rosa.&lt;ref name=Dumler/&gt;

The first ascent of the western summit finally took place on August 1, 1855, by the above guides Matthias and Johann zum Taugwald and Ulrich Lauener and two of the Smyth brothers (James Greenville and Christopher). They were joined by the English gentlemen [[John Birkbeck]], [[Charles Hudson (climber)|Charles Hudson]] and Edward Stephenson. Deeming the approach from the east summit unfeasible, the guides devised a route over the junction of the Monte Rosa and Grenz glaciers and over the west ridge directly to the west summit. Not two weeks later, on 13 August 1855, Johann and his brother Peter zum Taugwald guided eight more people, including [[Johann Jakob Weilenmann]], to the summit over the same route.&lt;ref&gt;Studer, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; The west ridge route immediately became very popular and is still the normal route to the Dufourspitze.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summitpost.org/dufourspitze/150756 Dufourspitze] at summitpost.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish physicist [[John Tyndall]] was guided to the summit in a group led by Ulrich Lauener in August 1858, but returned the next day (or week?) to make the first solo ascent of Dufourspitze on 17 August 1858, which he described in his account, ''Glaciers of the Alps''.&lt;ref name=Dumler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tyndall]], ''The Glaciers of the Alps'', p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;
:"After breakfast I poured what remained of my tea into a small glass bottle, an ordinary demi-bouteille in fact; the waiter then provided me with a ham sandwich, and, with my scrip thus frugally furnished, I thought the heights of Monte Rosa might be won..."

After encountering a party of climbers guided by Lauener, Tyndall reached alone the summit:
:"A world of clouds and mountains lay beneath me. Switzerland, with its pomp of summits, was clear and grand; Italy was also grand, but more than half obscured. Dark cumulus and dark crag vied in savagery, while at other places white snows and white clouds held equal rivalry. The scooped valleys of Monte Rosa itself were magnificent, all gleaming in the bright sunlight&amp;nbsp;— tossed and torn at intervals, and sending from their rents and walls the magical blue of the ice."

[[File:Dufourspitze01.jpg|thumb|View from the base of the east face]]
Among mountain guides, the eastern wall had the reputation of being unconquerable. Ferdinand Imseng was convinced that the long snow couloir in the middle of the face could be ascended. He succeeded in convincing other climbers and, on 22 July 1872, [[Richard Pendlebury]], William and Charles Taylor, Ferdinand Imseng, Gabriel Spechtenhauser and Giovanni Oberto began the ascent from Macugnaga. They were aware of the objective dangers of the wall but they decided to go as high as possible, without compromising their lives. After a bivouac on the actual Marinelli hut emplacement, they headed towards the Grenzsattel. Suddenly, when they arrived near the Grenzsattel, an avalanche started and rivers of snow began to flow everywhere around the climbers. They were able to reach the safe rocks of the [[Grenzgipfel]] just in time to save their lives. They finally reached the summit and descended to [[Riffelalp]] on the other side, concluding an 18-hour journey.&lt;ref name=Dumler/&gt;

This ascent made Ferdinand Imseng a famous mountain guide. He lost his life in 1881 on the east wall during the third ascent with Damiano Marinelli and guide Battista Pedranzini. On 8 August, they were caught by an avalanche and brought 1,200&amp;nbsp;metres down. The accident was reported by a porter who survived. The couloir was then named ''Canalone Marinelli''.&lt;ref name=Dumler/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gos"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gos|first=Charles|title=Alpine Tragedy|chapter=The Blast of an Avalanche|others=Trans. Malcolm Barnes|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]]|year=1948|pages=116–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ascents ===
In 1889 [[Achille Ratti]], who became later Pope Pius XI, made the first traverse from Macugnaga to Zermatt by the Zumsteinjoch. After climbing the Dufourspitze, he spent the night on the summit with his companions.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Shoumatoff, Nina Shoumatoff: ''The Alps: Europe's Mountain Heart'' (page 198). University of Michigan Press 2001, {{ISBN|0-472-11111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visiting Zermatt in 1894, the young [[Winston Churchill]] insisted on an ascent of Monte Rosa rather than of the Matterhorn, not only because of its superior height but also because the guides' fee was substantially less.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/skiing/switzerland-for-skiing-dont-look-down-look-up-428898.html Switzerland for skiing: Don't look down, look up] independent.co.uk, retrieved 21 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, on August 1 (which happens to be the [[Swiss National Day]]), 2005, the Swiss [[Federal Department of Economic Affairs|Minister of Treasure]] [[Joseph Deiss]] climbed the Dufourspitze. The expedition marked the 150th anniversary of the first ascent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/search/Result.html?siteSect=882&amp;ty=st&amp;sid=5979956 Switzerland enjoys the highs of August 1, swissinfo]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Huts and climbing routes ==
[[File:Neue Monte Rosa Huette2.JPG|thumb|The Monte Rosa Hut in May in front of the [[Lyskamm]]]]
The [[Monte Rosa Hut]] (2,883&amp;nbsp;m) is the only mountain hut in the massif owned by the [[Swiss Alpine Club]]. It is situated on the ''Plattje'', a rocky island between the Gorner and Grenz glaciers. It is accessible from [[Rotenboden railway station|Rotenboden]], a station on the [[Gornergratbahn]] line. The hut was inaugurated in 1894 and rebuilt in 1940. In 2009, a new high technology mountain hut was inaugurated. The five-story crystal-shaped building is designed to obtain 90 per cent of its power needs from the sun and will be used as a research station.

The other huts are owned by the [[Club Alpino Italiano|Italian Alpine Club]], among them the [[Regina Margherita Hut]] located at 4,559&amp;nbsp;metres on the [[Signalkuppe]]. Inaugurated in 1893 and replaced in 1979, it is still the highest construction in Europe, which include a laboratory and observatory.

Other huts owned by the Italian Alpine Club are the [[Marinelli Hut]] (3,036&amp;nbsp;m), used for the ascent of the east face, and the [[Bivacco Città di Gallarate]] (3,960&amp;nbsp;m), located near the summit of the [[Jägerhorn]].

=== Normal route ===
The [[:File:Dufour swiss.jpg|normal route to the summit]] start from the [[Monte Rosa Hut]]. The normal route is mainly a glacier itinerary on the west slopes of Monte Rosa (Monte Rosa Glacier), with the final rocky west ridge to the summit. Although the itinerary itself is not difficult, it requires physical endurance and a good [[acclimatization]].

=== Marinelli couloir ===
The route starts from the [[Marinelli Hut]] and follows the steep Marinelli couloir on the east face. It is a long and dangerous route and has to be ascended very early in the morning on cold days in order to decrease the risk of avalanches.

The '''El Malpais National Conservation Area''' is a federally protected conservation area in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Mexico]].  The El Malpais National Conservation area was established in 1987 and is managed by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] as part of the [[National Landscape Conservation System]]. The adjoining [[El Malpais National Monument]] was established at the same time and is managed by the [[National Park Service]].

The {{convert|263000|acre|km2|adj=on}} El Malpais NCA includes two wilderness areas — the [[West Malpais Wilderness]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/blm_special_areas/wilderness_and_wsas/wilderness_areas/west_malpais.html|title=West Malpais Wilderness|accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cebolla Wilderness|Cebolla Wilderness Area]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/blm_special_areas/wilderness_and_wsas/wilderness_areas/cebolla.html|title=Cebolla Wilderness|accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; — covering almost {{convert|100000|acre|km2}}.

==Features==
El Malpais translates to "the [[badlands]]" in Spanish and is pronounced Mal-(rhymes with wall)-pie-ees. The El Malpais National Conservation Area was established to protect nationally significant geological, archaeological, ecological, cultural, scenic, scientific, and wilderness resources surrounding the [[Grants Lava Flows]].

In addition to the two [[wilderness area]]s, the NCA includes dramatic [[sandstone]] cliffs, canyons, La Ventana Natural Arch, the Chain of Craters Back Country Byway and the Narrows Picnic Area. There are many opportunities for photography, hiking, camping and wildlife viewing within this unique NCA.

There are two visitor centers that serve the NCA, both off of I-40.  El Malpais Visitor Center, operated jointly with the National Park Service, is located on the south side of exit 85.  The Bureau of Land Management Ranger Station is located about 8 miles south of exit 89 on State Highway 117.

==Cultural landscape==
For more than 10,000 years people have interacted with the El Malpais landscape. Historic and prehistoric [[Cultural landscape]] sites provide connections to past times. More than mere artifacts, these cultural resources are kept alive by the spiritual and physical presence of contemporary Indian groups, including the Puebloan peoples of [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]], [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]] and [[Zuni people|Zuni]], and the Ramah [[Navajo people|Navajo]]. These tribes continue their ancestral uses of El Malpais including gathering plant materials, paying respect, and renewing ties.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

'''Frenchman Pass''' is a narrow passage on the island of [[Aruba]], between coral cliffs above the area known as Spanish Lagoon. From the pass one can see the remains of the Balashi Gold Mill.

Legend has it that [[France|French]] [[pirate]]s tried to invade Aruba in the early 17th century and were confronted by Indians in this narrow passage above Spanish Lagoon.  After this encounter, the passage became known as “Franse Pas” or “Rooi Frances” in [[Papiamento]], which translates to “Frenchman Pass” in English.  Many Indians were killed during the invasion, and today inhabitants near "Frenchman pass" claim they hear crying noises from the Indians during the evening. Some say the Indian ghosts are awake and haunting the area known as Spanish Lagoon.


This early period of Aruba’s history is not well documented, so history depends on [[legend]] and stories that are passed down from generation to generation.

[[Taiwan]] is active geologically, formed on a complex [[convergent boundary]] between the [[Yangtze Plate|Yangtze Subplate]] of the [[Eurasian Plate]] to the west and north, the [[Okinawa Plate]] on the north-east, the [[Philippine Plate]] on the east and south, and the [[Sunda Plate]] to the southwest.  [[Subduction]] changes direction at Taiwan.
The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate, which is moving to the northeast. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/~anderson/taiwan/tai_index.html |title=Geology of Taiwan&amp;nbsp;— University of Arizona |website=Geo.arizona.edu |date= |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting under the Sunda Plate, forming the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]] (including [[Green Island, Taiwan|Green Island]] and [[Orchid Island]]).  The east and south of the island are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the Luzon Volcanic Arc and the Eurasian Plate, where accreted portions of the Luzon Arc and Luzon forearc form the [[Haian Range|eastern Coastal Range]] and parallel inland [[Huatung Valley|Taitung Longitudinal Valley]] of Taiwan respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, Schouten and Draut (2003) in ''Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes'', {{ISBN|1-86239-147-5}} p84–86&lt;/ref&gt;

To the northeast, the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting under the Okinawa Plate, forming the [[Ryukyu]] Volcanic Arc.

==Terranes==
[[File:Haian Range, Taiwan.jpg|thumb|[[Haian Range]]]]
The [[Haian Range]] or Coastal Range [[terrane]] belongs to the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]] (呂宋島火山弧), and is on the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] (菲律賓海板塊).  West of this is the Longitudinal Valley or [[Huatung Valley]], an active depositional zone in a rift valley.  West of this is the Eastern Central Range terrane, part of the continental base that has been upturned. The western side of the range is the Western Central Range terrane, which is metamorphosed earlier Tertiary clastic sediments.  The '''Lishan Fault''' separates the Hsuehshan Range terrane Eocene to Oligocene sandstone and shale.  The '''Chukou Fault''' (觸口斷層) provides the boundary for the Western Foothills terrane, which is shallow marine detritus from Miocene to Pleistocene.  A deformation front forms the boundary with the undeformed coastal plains alluvium, which is still depositing.&lt;ref name=ma/&gt;

The Eastern Central Range terrane can be divided into the Tailuko belt on the west with greenschist metamorphism and the Yuli belt on the east with blueschist metamorpism.  The two metamorphic belts are possibly separated by a fault called Shoufeng fault, but this is unproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_eastern_15.jsp |title=Metamorphc Belts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215025512/http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_eastern_15.jsp |archivedate=2010-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central Mountains==
[[File:Central Range.jpg|thumb|[[Central Mountain Range]]]]

The oldest exposed rocks are heavily metamorphosed and found in the Central Mountains.&lt;ref name=goc&gt;{{cite book|title=Geology of China|chapter=Geology of Taiwan Province|authors=Zhang Jinhai and He Lishi|isbn=7-116-02268-6|publisher=Geological Publishing House|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poor quality fossil evidence suggests an origin in the [[Permian]] Period. They form a band of rock from [[Nan-ao, Yilan|Nan'ao]] in the north to inland of [[Jinfeng, Taitung|Jinfeng]] on the eastern flank of the [[Central Mountain Range]]. The band is 30&amp;nbsp;km wide in the north and narrows to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern Central Range Introduction |url=http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_eastern_1.jsp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524180702/http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_eastern_1.jsp |archivedate=2011-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These earlier rocks are heavily metamorphosed. They also occur as a basement beneath the western part of the island. They make up the '''Danana'ao Group''' or Tananao Schist.  This group consists of the Kainanagang Gneiss, Tailuge Marble, and Changchun Schist.

The Yuli Schist is [[Cretaceous]] in age and consists of black schist and some [[greenschist]], [[glaucophane]] [[schist]], and spotted [[slate]]. It is the easternmost part and extends from Chian southwards to the west of the Chihpen hot springs in a belt about 150&amp;nbsp;km long. Although the dark colour of the black schist is due to carbon, carbon is less than 2% of the content. The minerals found are quartz, [[mica]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[albite]], [[sphene]], and [[graphite]].&lt;ref name=lomr&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern Central Range Occurrence and Lithology of Metamorphic Rocks |url=http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_eastern_12.jsp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215025437/http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_eastern_12.jsp |archivedate=2010-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Changchun Schist being mostly [[greenschist]] is found on the western side and forms thick beds. It is found along with smaller amounts of [[chert]], and black schist.  The rock is foliated dark green rock containing chlorite, [[epidote]], quartz, calcite, biotite, albite and [[actinolite]]. They are derived from [[mafic]] [[volcanic rock]]s.  These rocks can host [[copper sulfide]] ores.&lt;ref name=lomr/&gt;

Siliceous schists are coloured grey, they are metamorphosed sandstone, rich in quartz. [[Quartzite]] and chert bands can be found, and they are commonly associated with the black schist.

The Chiuchu Formation or Tailuge Marble forms a band from Tailuko in the north to a point between Wulu and Kuanshan in the south. The [[limestone]] is mined in quarries south of Suao for cement manufacture. Although the colour is usually a shade of grey, there are also black or white limestone, which is chopped into blocks for building purposes. [[Dolostone|Dolomite]] is also found along with the limestone particularly at [[Chingchangshan]], [[Hopingchi]], and [[Mukuashan]].&lt;ref name=lomr/&gt;

The Kainangan Gneiss or Kanagan Formation occurs in several elongated bodies. The [[gneiss]] derived from sedimentary rocks contains coarse grained quartz, biotite, and albitic plagioclase.  There is also orthogneiss derived from [[granite]]. This is light grey and contains sodic plagioclase, quartz, biotite, and muscovite.  Within the gneiss there are [[pegmatite]] [[Dike (geology)|dikes]] containing quartz, feldspar and mica.&lt;ref name=lomr/&gt;
 
Other igneous rocks found in the old metamorphic belt are [[amphibolite]] and [[dolerite]] dikes. [[Serpentinite]] is found 5&amp;nbsp;km west of Fengtien (奉天).  It contains exploited deposits of [[nephrite]], [[talc]] and [[asbestos]]. [[Wanjung, Hualien|Wanjung Station]] (萬榮) is close to more outcrops of serpentenite.  Tamayenshan block northwest of [[Juisui, Hualien|Juisui]] (瑞穗) and the Tsenghuanshan block 10&amp;nbsp;km west of Juisui are significant [[ultramafic]] outcrops.&lt;ref name=lomr/&gt;

Green serpentinite from near [[Yuli, Hualien|Yuli]] makes a good quality building stone. A band of ultramafic rocks extends for 25&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Litao, Taitung]] (離島).&lt;ref name=lomr/&gt;

The area was subjected to the Nanao Orogeny around 85&amp;nbsp;Ma which involved the granite intrusion and regional metamorphism. Rifting that opened the [[South China Sea]] around 40 Ma may be connected with some dolerite intrusions. The Penglai Orogeny started about 10 Ma and continues at the present time.&lt;ref name=ecrra&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern Central Range Radiometric Ages |url=http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_eastern_14.jsp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215025250/http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_eastern_14.jsp |archivedate=2010-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern stratigraphic region==
The most recently added part of the island is the [[Haian Range|Coastal Range]] on the east coast from [[Taitung City]] in the  south to Hualien City in the north.  The range is the continuation of the Luzon arc.  The age is [[Neogene]] and the rock consist of [[Mélange|melange]] and [[volcaniclastic]]s.  The rock units are firstly Chimei Volcanics Miocene [[andesite]].  Next is the Tuluanshan Formation, consisting of [[tuff]], then Takangou Formation, consisting of sediments such as shale and sandstone that contain volcanic particles. The Lichi Formation consists of melange.  It is made of mud containing blocks of other stone such as sandstone and [[ophiolite]].  It is found on the southern half of the west side of the Coastal range.  When this erodes, [[badlands]] are formed. Because it is a mixture of stone, the Lichi Formation is hard to date, but is likely to be from [[Pliocene]].&lt;ref name=ecrsal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_eastern_22.jsp |title=Eastern Coastal Range Stratigraphy and Lithology |author=Central Geological Survey MOEI |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927123537/http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_eastern_22.jsp |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pinanshan [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] is found on Pinanshan Hill and along the Pinantachi stream north of [[Taitung City|Taitung]] (台東).  The constituents are 5–15&amp;nbsp;cm cobbles erodes by freshwater from the Central Range.  It formed somewhere from middle to late Pleistocene, and indicates the plate collision had taken place.&lt;ref name=ecrsal/&gt;

The Milun Conglomerate is to the north of Hualien.  This has also gone under the names of Beiron Conglomerate Formation and Milunpi Conglomerate.  It is tilted at 30°.  It is undated but is likely from Pleistocene.&lt;ref name=ecrsal/&gt;

==Central Mountains strata==
Shibachongxi Formation is from the Eocene consisting of slate and then beds of metamorphosed sandstone.  The total thickness is up to 1000&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=goc/&gt;

Dajian Formation consists of sandstone from the upper Eocene, up to 2700 meters thick.&lt;ref name=goc/&gt;

Xichun Formation slate and [[phyllite]] is from the lower Oligocene.  The thickness is from 0.6 to 3&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=goc/&gt;

Siling Formation coarse sandstone in thick beds is from the Oligocene.&lt;ref name=goc/&gt;

Shuichungliu Formation form the Oligocene contains [[argillaceous]] slate and [[graywacke]].&lt;ref name=goc/&gt;

Lushan Formation from the Miocene contains shale slate and sandstone.&lt;ref name=goc/&gt;

Aodi Formation contemporary

Sule Formation slate and sandstone from the later Miocene.

==Western stratigraphic region==
The west part of the island exposes deformed and metamorphosed [[Cenozoic]] sediments, overlaid by [[Quaternary]] piedmont region in the flat plains on the west coast.

[[Cretaceous]], [[Paleocene]] and Eocene deposits are not exposed on the surface, but are buried.  They have been discovered by drilling.

The Yunlin Formation is from the Cretaceous and only known from boreholes.  The rocks are siltstone, basalt, shale and limestone.

The Paleocene Wangong Formation consisting of [[volcaniclastic]]s, sandstone, shale and limestone is over 1046 meters thick.

In the [[Eocene]] the Shuangji Formation formed mostly from volcanic particles in the form of tuff and tuffaceous sandstone.  These beds are from 100 m to 3&amp;nbsp;km thick.

In the [[Oligocene]] the Wuzhishan Formation or Wuchihshan Formation (五指山組) formed thick beds of sandstone.  The total thickness is 0.9 to 1.2&amp;nbsp;km.

The Yeliu Group from the [[Miocene]] is fine grained sandstone, with some beds of shale, basaltic tuff and three seams of [[coal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://52jyw.com/%B5%E7%D7%D3%CD%BC%CA%E9/035/T/A2038224.pdf |title=Tertiary in Petroliferous Regions of China }}&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly including Wushan Formation, Piling Shale, Peiliao Formation, Talu shale, Shihti Formation, Kuanyiongshan sandstone.&lt;ref name=acc/&gt;

The Ruifang Group contains beds of sandstone, siltstone, shale and six thin coal beds. These beds are 0.8 to 1.6&amp;nbsp;km thick.

The Sangxia Group starts with medium grained sandstone, but in the upper layers increases shale.  Eight thin coal seams are included.  The total thickness of the deepest beds exceeds 5&amp;nbsp;km.  This includes the Kueichulin Formation with the Yutengping Sandstone, Shihliufen Shale, Kuantaoshan Sandstone; the Nanchuang Formation including Shangfuchi Sandstone and Tungkeng Formation.&lt;ref name=acc/&gt;

The Jinshui Formation or Chinshui Formation from the [[Pliocene]] is mostly shale interbedded with some [[mudstone]] and sandstone is between 80 and 400&amp;nbsp;m thick.

The Zhuolan Formation or Cholan Formation (卓蘭層) starts in the Pliocene and extends into the first stage of the [[Pleistocene]].  It consists of fine grained sandstone.  This is 1.5 to 2.5&amp;nbsp;km thick.
At the same time on the southern tip of the island, the Kending Formation or Kenting Formation (墾丁組) was formed consisting of mudstone with [[ophiolite]] [[Mélange|melange]].&lt;ref name=ghp&gt;{{cite web|title=Geology of the Hungchun Peninsula|url=http://www.gl.ntu.edu.tw/model/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=30&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724235434/http://www.gl.ntu.edu.tw/model/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=30&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1|archivedate=2011-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ophiolite melange contains pebbles and blocks of Miocene age consisting of basic and ultrabasic rock from the ocean floor.

The Toukoshan Formation (Toukeshan) (頭嵙山層) commenced with fine sandstone with thin beds of conglomerate, and continued into mainly conglomerate with sandstone beds.  This was formed in stage 1 and 2 of the Pleistocene.  It is from 0.4 to 3&amp;nbsp;km thick.

The Szekou Formation is a light bluish gray siltstone, with shale and fine grained sandstone.  The Maanshan Formation is very similar. It is overlain by Hengchun Limestone and may interfinger.&lt;ref name=ghp/&gt;

==Western piedmont region==
The Hengchun Limestone was formed after the Penglai movement in the third Pleistocene stage.  Also at this time [[laterite]] (紅土) and gravel on [[river terrace]]s was formed.  [[Holocene]] mud sand and coral form a wide belt on the west side of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Tropical Oceanography|date=February 2004|

The [[Tatun Volcano Group]] is found on the northern tip of Taiwan. [[Qixing Mountain (Taipei)|Chihsingshan]] is the highest point of the volcanoes at 1120 meters.  The volcanoes have formed the rounded shape of the northern cape of Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_setting.jsp |publisher=Central Geological Survey |title=Geographic Setting |work=Geology of Taiwan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524175532/http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_setting.jsp |archivedate=24 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The volcanic rock also occur on Huaping Isle, Mienhua Isle, [[Pengjia Islet|Pengchia Isle]] and Huangwei Isle just to the north of Taiwan.  The rocks are aluminium rich [[andesite]], [[tuff]] and [[breccia]].  The rocks are poor in sodium and magnesium, but rich in iron, potassium, rubidium and strontium and strong in rare earth elements. The magma was derived by melting of the underthrust sea plate behind the [[Ryukyu arc|Ryukyu Volcanic Arc]] during the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name=goc/&gt;

The Caolingshan Basalt consists of olivine and pyroxene, with crystals of biotite and plagioclase.  This is rich in K, Rb, Mg, Sr, Cr, and Ni, but poor in Na, Al, and Fe.  Rare earth elements are strongly enriched. The magma was derived by deep mantle melting of the underthrust sea plate behind the Ryukyu Volcanic Arc during the Pleistocene.&lt;ref name=goc/&gt;

The [[Chilung Volcano Group|volcanoes on Chilungshan]], Penshan, Caoshan, [[Chilung Island]] (Keelung Islet) and [[Gueishan Island]] date from the Pleistocene period and later.  The eruption were explosive [[tholeiitic]] andesite and [[dacite]].  The main mineral is calcium rich [[plagioclase]].  The magma source is the western extremity of the Ryukyu Volcanic Arc formed when the [[subducting]] [[Philippines Sea Plate]] was compressed below the edge of the Eurasian Plate at about 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;km deep.  The magma was contaminated with continental crust material.  Geochemistry of the rock shows that iron, aluminium, titanium, potassium, rubidium and strontium are enriched, but sodium, magnesium and nickel are impoverished.&lt;ref name=goc/&gt;

Alkaline volcanic rocks from north west Taiwan are found at the [[Shihmen Dam|Shihmen Reservoir]], Chiaopanshan, [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]] and Fuxing.  The rocks are [[picrite]], [[alkaline basalt]] and [[trachyandesite]].  The commons minerals are [[albite]], [[olivine]], [[clinopyroxene]] and oxides of iron and titanium.  The elements enriched are sodium and titanium, and magnesium and calcium are reduced.  The rock dates from the Miocene.  The magma was formed under tension conditions on the continental margin from deep down in the mantle.&lt;ref name=goc/&gt;

Volcanoes on the Coastal Range and [[Green Island, Taiwan|Green Island]] erupted tholeiite andesite, and volcanic explosive fragments.  The volcanoes erupted from the [[Pliocene]] to Pleistocene period.  It is part of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]].  Magma was formed from subducting [[oceanic crust]] under compression about 25&amp;nbsp;km deep.  The andesite rock contains some visible crystals of [[pyroxene]] or [[amphibole]].  The [[geochemistry]] of the rock shows it is enriched in [[potassium]], [[strontium]] and [[rubidium]] and [[LREE|light rare earth elements]]. Chromium and nickel are depleted.&lt;ref name=goc/&gt;  The Chimei Volcanic Complex, near the [[Xiuguluan River|Hsiukuluanchi River]], has an age from 9 to 22.2 Ma.

Pleistocene basalt and tholeiite is found in the [[Penghu Islands]].  The lava erupted from fissures in a flood.  The rock is enriched in titanium and poor in aluminium, rubidium and strontium.  The alkaline basalt contains olivine and [[analcite]].  The tholeiite contains plagioclase and pyroxene.  The magma originated in the upper mantle under tension conditions on the continental margin.&lt;ref name=goc/&gt;

==Tectonics==
The Philippines Sea Plate is converging with the continent at 7&amp;nbsp;cm per year in the west north west direction. It has compressed Cenozoic sediments by around 200&amp;nbsp;km in the last 4&amp;nbsp;[[Year#SI_prefix_multipliers|Ma]]. The piled up sediment is rising into mountains at the rate of 5&amp;nbsp;mm per year.&lt;ref name=goc/&gt;

The major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various terranes. As a result, Taiwan has numerous [[mud volcano]]es and [[hot spring]]s. These faults have produced [[List of earthquakes in Taiwan|several major quakes]] throughout the history of the island, including the [[1951 East Rift Valley earthquakes]] on the East Rift Valley (花東縱谷) and [[1964 Baihe earthquake]] on the Chukou Fault. The [[1946 Hsinhua earthquake]] ruptured the Hsinhua fault (新化斷層). The most lethal was [[1935 Hsinchu-Taichung earthquake]] shifting on a fault at [[Emei, Hsinchu|Emei Township]], [[Hsinchu County]]. The second deadliest was a 7.3 quake that ruptured the Chelongpu Fault (車籠埔斷層) on 21 September 1999, known as the "[[1999 Jiji earthquake|921 earthquake]]".

==Geophysics==
Taiwan has a very strong, positive [[Bouguer gravity anomaly]] in the Coastal Range, at over +4x10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;ms&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Positive magnetic variations are found in narrow strips, west-southwest oriented of the west coast, and east-northeast off the northern coast, and south-north offshore from the Coastal Range heading south.  These are of the order of 200&amp;nbsp;nT.&lt;ref&gt;Geology of China page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crustal thickness is around 30&amp;nbsp;km, with over 2&amp;nbsp;km of thickening under the Central Range, and thinning off the east coast.  Taiwan is on the edge of the continental shelf, so the thickness of the crust is constant through the Taiwan Strait to the mainland.&lt;ref name="Geology of China page 62"/&gt;

Heat flow is greatest to west of the Longitudinal Valley at rates exceeding 240&amp;nbsp;mWm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Hydrology==
[[File:Beitou Hot Spring Valley.jpg|thumb|right|Beitou hot spring valley]]
Many of the rocks in Taiwan have low pore space and have little ground water.

There are several hot springs in Taiwan, with most around the northern volcanic region.  The Chingshui geothermal region is named after the [[Cingshuei River]] 13&amp;nbsp;km south west of [[Yilan City|Yilan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/pdf/IGAstandard/SGW/2006/fan.pdf|title=Evaluation of Natural Recharge of Chingshui Geothermal Reservoir in Taiwan|author=K.

Rivers in Taiwan transport a large amount of sediment to the sea.  The south end of the Longitudonal Valley discharges the [[Peinan River]] with 88,000,000 tons of sediment per year.  East flowing rivers  move 17, 15 31 and 22 megatons per year of sediment.  The [[Zhuoshui River|Cho Shiu]] shifts 54 MT per year.  Rivers running south from the Central Range move over 100&amp;nbsp;MT of sediment per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.springerimages.com/Images/Geosciences/1-10.1007_s10064-009-0209-y-35|title=Home - Springer|website=Springerimages.com|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==
===Mapping===
The first [[geological map]] of Taiwan was made in 1898 by Y. Ishii titled ''A Map of Geology and Mineral Resources of the Island of Taiwan''.  It was at a scale of 1:800,000 and showed six items in its legend.&lt;ref name=egm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_map.jsp |title=Earlier Geologic Maps Of Taiwan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524180608/http://www.moeacgs.gov.tw/english/twgeol/twgeol_map.jsp |archivedate=2011-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan needed oil and coal for the war against Russia in 1904, so study began on the coal fields in the north part of Taiwan, more detailed maps were made, and the next one was published in 1911 by Y. Deguchi and G. Hosoya at a scale of 1:300,000.&lt;ref name=egm/&gt; A third map was produced in 1926 titled: ''Geological Map of Taiwan showing Mineral Distribution'' by Y. Ichikawa and H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1060">A '''glacial boundary''' is a line on a map representing the farthest advance of a [[glacier]] that has retreated.  It generally refers to the extent of continental, rather than alpine, glaciers.

In the northern hemisphere, glaciers advanced from the north during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch.  The glacial boundary thus represents the farthest southern extent of the glaciers at that time.

In North America, the boundary from the most recent ice sheet passes through the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington.  It also crosses the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]] in several locations.

[[Image:Hubble Deep Field South.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Hubble Deep Field South. Credit: [[NASA]]/[[ESA]]. [[ISOHDFS 27]] is on the bottom right.]]
The '''Hubble Deep Field South''' is a composite of several hundred individual images taken using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] over 10 days in September and October 1998.  It followed the great success of the original [[Hubble Deep Field]] in facilitating the study of extremely distant [[galaxy|galaxies]] in early stages of their [[Galaxy formation and evolution|evolution]].  While the WFPC2 took very deep optical images, nearby fields were simultaneously imaged by the [[Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph]] (STIS) and the [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer]] (NICMOS).

==Planning==
The rationale behind making another Deep Field image was to provide observatories in the [[southern hemisphere]] with a similarly deep optical image of the distant universe as had been provided to those in the [[northern hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="hdfs_desc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdfsouth/project.html | title=HDF-S Project Description | publisher=STScI | accessdate=December 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field chosen was in the [[constellation]] of [[Tucana]] at a [[right ascension]] of {{RA|22|32|56.22}} and [[declination]] of {{DEC|-60|33|02.69}}.&lt;ref name="coords"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdfsouth/coordinatesS.html | title=HDF-S Coordinates | publisher=STScI | accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the original [[Hubble Deep Field]] (referred to hereafter as the 'HDF-N'), the target area was selected to be far from the plane of the [[Milky Way]]'s [[galactic disk]], which contains a large amount of obscuring matter, and to contain as few galactic [[star]]s as possible. However the field is closer to the galactic plane than the HDF-N, meaning that it contains more galactic stars. It also has a nearby bright star, as well as a moderately strong radio source close by, but in both cases it was decided that these wouldn't compromise follow-up observations.&lt;ref name="Williams2000" /&gt;

As with the HDF-N, the field lies in Hubble's Continuous Viewing Zone (CVZ), this time in the south, allowing twice the normal observing time per orbit. At specific times of year, the HST can observe this zone continuously, without it being eclipsed by the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="Casertano2000"&gt;Casertano et al. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing this field, however, has some issues due to passages through the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]] and also with scattered [[earthshine]] during daylight hours; the latter can be avoided by using instruments with larger sources of noise, for example from the CCD reading process, at those times. The survey again used Director's Discretionary Time.&lt;ref name="Williams2000" /&gt;

The field was imaged briefly on October 30–31, 1997&lt;ref name="tests"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdfsouth/testdata.html | title=HDF-S 1997 TEST Observations | publisher=STScI | accessdate=December 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make sure that the guide stars in the field were acceptable; these guide stars would be required to keep the HST accurately pointing on the region during the observations proper.&lt;ref name="hdfs_desc" /&gt;

==Observations==
The observing strategy for the HDF-S was similar to that of the HDF-N, with the same [[optical filter]]s used for the WFPC2 images (isolating wavelengths at 300, 450, 606 and 814 nanometres), and similar total exposure times.  The observations were made over 10 days in September and October 1998,{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} a total of 150 orbits, and had a total exposure time of over 1.3 million seconds. While the WFPC2 took very deep optical images, the fields were simultaneously imaged by the [[Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph]] (STIS) and the [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer]] (NICMOS). A number of flanking fields were also observed for shorter periods of time.&lt;ref name="Williams2000"&gt;Williams et al. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the HDF-N, the images were processed using a technique known as '[[Drizzle (photometry)|drizzling]]', in which the direction the telescope was aimed was changed by a very small amount between exposures, and the resulting images combined using sophisticated techniques to achieve a higher [[angular resolution]] than would otherwise be possible. Translational changes were fine during the imaging parts of the observation; however, the telescope had to be rotated by small amounts instead of repointed during the spectroscopic work, such that the centre of the STIS instrument was kept on the central quasar.&lt;ref name="Williams2000" /&gt; The HDF-S final image had a [[pixel]] scale of 0.0398 [[arcsecond]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Contents of the HDF-S==
The [[cosmological principle]] states that at the largest scales, the universe is [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]], meaning that it should look the same in any direction.  The HDF-S would thus be expected to strongly resemble the HDF-N, and this was indeed the case, with large numbers of galaxies visible displaying a similar range of colours and morphologies to those seen in the HDF-N, and very similar numbers of galaxies in each of the fields.&lt;ref name="Casertano2000" /&gt;

One difference with the HDF-N was that the HDF-S included a known [[quasar]] with a [[redshift]] value of 2.24, [[J2233-606]], discovered during the search for the target field. The quasar provides a probe of the gas along the line of sight where the foreground objects are also observed, allowing an investigation into the association of galaxies with absorption features. Including a quasar in the field of view was originally considered for the HDF-N, but was decided against due to concerns about increased numbers of galaxies associated with the quasar might skew the galaxy number counts, and because there was not a favourably located quasar. For the Southern field, however, such a skewed count wasn't a concern due to the known counts from the HDF-N.&lt;ref name="Williams2000" /&gt;

==Scientific results==
As with the HDF-N, the HDF-S provided rich pickings for [[physical cosmology|cosmologists]].  Many studies of the HDF-S confirmed results found from the HDF-N, such as [[star formation]] rates over the lifetime of the universe.  The HDF-S was also extensively used in studies of how galaxies evolve over time, both due to internal processes and encounters with other galaxies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Following Hubble's observations of the HDF-S field, the field was also surveyed in the UV/optical/infrared frequency range by the [[Anglo-Australian Observatory]], the [[Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory]] and the [[European Southern Observatory]]. At mid-infrared it was observed by the [[Infrared Space Observatory]], and radio observations were made by the [[Australia Telescope National Facility]].&lt;ref name="clearinghouse"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdfsouth/clearinghouse.html | title=HDF-S Clearinghouse | publisher=STScI | accessdate=December 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:GT''' is the entry for [[Guatemala]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Guatemala, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[departments of Guatemala|22 departments]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|GT}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Guatemala. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

{{Refimprove|date=April 2012}}
[[File:Cono de Arita, Salta. (Argentina).jpg|thumb|This [[conical hill]] in [[Salar de Arizaro]], [[Salta Province|Salta]], [[Argentina]] called Cono de Arita constitutes a landform.]]
A '''landform''' is a natural feature of the solid surface of the Earth or other [[planetary body]].  Landforms together make up a given [[terrain]], and their arrangement in the landscape is known as [[topography]].  Typical landforms include [[hill]]s, [[mountain]]s, [[plateau]]s, [[canyon]]s, and [[valley]]s, as well as [[shoreline]] features such as [[bay]]s, [[peninsula]]s, and [[sea]]s,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} including submerged features such as [[mid-ocean ridge]]s, [[volcanoes]], and the great [[ocean basin]]s.

==Physical characteristics==
Landforms are categorized by characteristic physical attributes such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[Stratum|stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type. Gross physical features or landforms include intuitive elements such as [[berm]]s, [[mound]]s, [[hill]]s, [[ridge]]s, [[cliff]]s, [[valley]]s, [[river]]s, [[peninsula]]s, [[volcano]]es, and numerous other structural and size-scaled (i.e. [[pond]]s vs. [[lake]]s, [[hill]]s vs. [[mountain]]s) elements including various kinds of inland and oceanic [[Waterbody|waterbodies]] and sub-surface features.

{{wide image|Cades Cove Panorama.JPG|600px|This panorama in [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] has the readily identifiable '''physical features''' of a rolling [[plain]], actually part of a broad [[valley]], distant [[hill|foothills]], and a backdrop of the old, much [[weathering|weathered]] [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian mountain range]]}}

==Hierarchy of classes==
[[File:1 li jiang guilin yangshuo 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Karst|Karst towers]] landforms along [[Lijiang River]], [[Guilin]], [[China]]]]

[[Ocean]]s and [[continent]]s exemplify the highest-order landforms. [[Landform element]]s are parts of a high-order landforms that can be further identified and systematically given a cohesive definition such as hill-tops, shoulders, saddles, foreslopes and backslopes.

Some generic landform elements including: pits, peaks, channels, ridges, passes, pools and plains.

[[Terrain]] (or ''relief'') is the third or vertical dimension of ''land surface''. [[Topography]] is the study of terrain, although the word is often used as a synonym for relief itself. When relief is described [[underwater]], the term [[bathymetry]] is used. In [[cartography]], many [[Cartographic relief depiction|different techniques]] are used to describe relief, including [[contour line]]s and TIN ([[Triangulated irregular network]]).

Elementary landforms (segments, facets, relief units) are the smallest homogeneous divisions of the land surface, at the given scale/resolution. These are areas with relatively homogeneous [[morphometric]] properties, bounded by lines of discontinuity. A plateau or a hill can be observed at various scales ranging from few hundred meters to hundreds of kilometers. Hence, the spatial distribution of landforms is often scale-dependent as is the case for soils and geological strata.

A number of factors, ranging from [[plate tectonics]] to [[erosion]] and [[deposition (sediment)|deposition]], can generate and affect landforms. [[biology|Biological]] factors can also influence landforms— for example, note the role of [[vegetation]] in the development of [[dune]] systems and [[salt marsh]]es, and the work of [[coral]]s and [[alga]]e in the formation of [[reef|coral reefs]].

Landforms do not include man-made features, such as [[canal]]s, [[port]]s and many [[harbor]]s; and geographic features, such as [[desert]]s, [[forest]]s, and [[grassland]]s. Many of the terms are not restricted to refer to features of the planet [[Earth]], and can be used to describe surface features of other planets and similar objects in the [[Universe]]. Examples are mountains, hills, polar caps, and valleys, which are found on all of the [[terrestrial planets]].

The scientific study of landforms is known as [[geomorphology]].

==Recent developments==
Landforms may be extracted from a [[digital elevation model]] using some automated techniques where the data has been gathered by modern satellites and [[stereoscopic]] [[aerial photography|aerial surveillance]] cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/research/cires/banff/pubpapers/198/ |title=Conference paper: "Automated landform classification using DEMs"|accessdate=2008-06-26|author1=Robert A. MacMillan |author2=David H. McNabb |author3=R. Keith Jones |date=September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, compiling the data found in such data sets required time consuming and expensive techniques involving many man-hours.  The most detailed DEMs available are measured directly using [[LIDAR]] techniques.

'''Government in Tasmania''' is delivered by a number of '''agencies''', grouped under areas of portfolio responsibility. Each portfolio is led by a [[Minister (government)|government minister]] who is a member of the [[Parliament of Tasmania]], appointed by the [[Governor of Tasmania|Governor]] as the representative of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Crown]].

The agencies are principally grouped as eight departments, each led by a [[Departmental secretary|secretary]] or [[director-general]] and comprising a number of portfolios covering specific policy areas across the department and allocated statutory authorities, trading enterprises, boards, councils and other public bodies.

Agencies have varying levels of operational autonomy, and deliver one or more of frontline public services, administrative functions and law enforcement. Some are structured as for-profit corporations. Where there are multiple portfolios within a department, directors-general may be accountable to a number of ministers.

All agencies are identifiable by their corporate logo, which features in agency advertising, publications and correspondence, pictured right.

A list of articles on Tasmanian government agencies sorted alphabetically is available at [[:Category:Government agencies of Tasmania|Government agencies of Tasmania]]. The Tasmanian government maintains a list of agencies and their contact details [http://www.service.tas.gov.au/GovOrgs/ at its website].

==Education==
The '''[[Department of Education (Tasmania)|Department of Education]]''' (DoE) is the lead agency of the portfolio headed by the Minister for Education and Training, presently the Hon. [[Jeremy Rockliff]] MP.

The Department is led by its Secretary, Jenny Gale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.education.tas.gov.au/documentcentre/Documents/Organisational-Chart-Department-of-Education.pdf |title=Organisational chart |work=[[Department of Education (Tasmania)|Department of Education]] |publisher=Tasmanian Government |date= |accessdate=15 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Education is responsible for the following statutory and non-statutory bodies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.tas.gov.au/About_us/Pages/Our-Structure.aspx |title=Boards and Advisory Groups|work=[[Department of Education (Tasmania)|Department of Education]] |publisher=Tasmanian Government |date= |accessdate=15 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mountaineering]] is one of the most popular activities for many [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]]. A list of [[100 Peaks of Taiwan]] was created in 1971, which lists the one hundred mountains over 3,000 m for mountaineering on the island. Climbing all of the one hundred mountains listed is considered the greatest challenge for Taiwanese climbers.

'''Monarch Watch''' is a volunteer-based [[citizen science]] organization that tracks the fall migration of the [[monarch butterfly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Monarch butterfly biology &amp; conservation|date=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press|others=Oberhauser, Karen Suzanne., Solensky, Michelle J.|isbn=978-0801441882|location=Ithaca|oclc=54046294}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is self-described as "a nonprofit education, conservation, and research program based at the University of Kansas that focuses on the monarch butterfly, its habitat, and its spectacular fall [[Monarch butterfly migration|migration]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monarchwatch.org/about/index.htm|title=Monarch Watch : About Us : Introduction|last=jlovett@ku.edu|first=Jim Lovett -|website=monarchwatch.org|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Organization==
The informal organization is largely supported by teachers and students participating in "classroom projects, collaborative research" among other opportunities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Brad|last2=Taylor|first2=Orley|date=May 1996|title=Monarch migration|url=|journal=The Science Teacher|volume=63|issue=5|pages=26|issn=00368555|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founder and director is Orley R. "Chip" Taylor, a "world-renowned expert on butterflies and their migration patterns." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/462300037/abstract/7198F32DBA354D86PQ/1|title=Monarch Watch sets open house|last=Kealing|first=Jonathan|date=Sep 7, 2007|work=McClatchy - Tribune Business News|access-date=Oct 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization creates and distributes tags to place on monarch butterflies in order to track their migration path from [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] to south-central [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holzberg|first=Carol S.|date=Nov 1999|title=Monarch watch|url=|journal=Technology &amp; Learning|volume=20|issue=4|pages=46|issn=10536728|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tagging method used is derived from the one that was developed by [[Canadians|Canadian]] scientist, [[Fred Urquhart|Fred Urquhart]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The tagging process was adapted by Orley Taylor to minimize the damage to the butterflies. Color-coded tags are glued to a monarch butterfly's wing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Volunteers have tagged over 1.5 million monarchs in the last 26 years from Colorado to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://monarchwatch.org/blog/2018/08/03/a-message-to-all-taggers/|title=A Message to all Taggers|date=2018-08-03|work=Monarch Watch|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monarch Waystation Program ==
[[File:Monarch Waystation Sign.jpg|alt=Monarch Waystation Sign|thumb|Monarch Waystation Sign]]
The monarch butterfly is also known as the milkweed butterfly due to its subsistence on the [[Asclepias|milkweed plant]] for its habitat.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Brad|last2=Taylor|first2=Orley|date=May 1996|title=Monarch migration|url=|journal=The Science Teacher|volume=63|issue=5|pages=26|issn=00368555|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely due to commercial farming practices, the habitats of monarch butterflies have declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monarchwatch.org/waystations/|title=Monarch Watch : Monarch Waystation Program|last=jlovett@ku.edu|first=Jim Lovett -|website=monarchwatch.org|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to mitigate the destruction of the monarch butterflies natural habitat, Monarch Watch has called for volunteers to plant milkweed wherever possible. Milkweed is essential to the life-cycle of the monarch butterfly as they lay their eggs on the underside of the plant's leaves.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spangler|first=Holly|date=Mar 16, 2018|title=Farmers for Monarchs -- and milkweed?|url=|journal=Western Farm Press|volume=|pages=|issn=15251217|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to register and certify a site that is designated as a "Monarch Waystation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monarchwatch.org/waystations/certify.html|title=Monarch Watch : Monarch Waystation Program|last=jlovett@ku.edu|first=Jim Lovett -|website=monarchwatch.org|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sites can also be added to an interactive map that is monitored by Monarch Watch. The program also offers free milkweed plugs to people that engage in the creation of habitats for monarchs and pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monarchwaystationnetwork.res.ku.edu/|title=Monarch Waystation Network|website=Monarch Waystation Network|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary consideration is given to non-profits and schools. There is an application process to receive the milkweed from Monarch Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://biosurvey.ku.edu/application-free-milkweed-nonprofits-and-schools|title=Free Milkweed for Schools and NonProfits Application|date=2016-11-22|work=Kansas Biological Survey|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bring Back the Monarchs Campaign ==
Monarch Watch is not only focused on tracking the fall migration of monarchs, but also on the conservation of the monarch butterfly through the preservation and restoration of monarch habitats.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monarchwatch.org/about/index.htm|title=Bring Back The Monarchs|last=|first=|date=|website=monarchwatch.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of habitats has negatively affected the monarch butterfly population as well as that of other [[Pollinator|pollinators]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Habitat shrinkage has resulted in the extinction of several species of pollinators over the last 50 years.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holzberg|first=Carol S.|date=Nov 1999|title=Monarch watch|url=|journal=Technology &amp; Learning|volume=20|issue=4|pages=46|issn=10536728|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monarch butterfly is also affected by parasites and the "declining winter habitat in Mexico."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Monarch Watch's efforts in this arena are specifically referred to at the "Bring Back the Monarchs Campaign."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Bring Back the Monarchs Campaign is an offshoot of the Monarch Waystation Program.

=== Milkweed Market ===
Beyond offering free [[Asclepias|milkweed]] plugs, Monarch Watch also offers a shop by which an individual can purchase milkweed for the purpose of creating monarch habitats. The milkweed species offered to the buyer is contingent on the buyer's zip code, in an effort to ensure that only native milkweed is planted in the appropriate regional areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monarchwatch.org/milkweed/market/|title=Monarch Watch Milkweed Market|website=monarchwatch.org|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7700">'''Oskar Schmieder''' (January 27, 1891 in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]] - February 12, 1980 in [[Schleswig]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[geographer]] and expert in the regional geography of Latin America. He spent his early career with [[Carl O. Sauer]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], where he was an Associate Professor from 1926 to 1930.

== Life ==
Schmieder studied geography at the [[University of Bonn]], [[University of Königsberg]], and the [[University of Heidelberg]]. His dissertation on the [[Sierra de Gredos]] was supervised by [[Alfred Hettner]]. Although focusing on physical geography, the final conclusions of his dissertation already include a certain notion of the social and cultural-historical forces that are decisive for the genesis of the landscape (later known as the [[Culture|cultural]]-[[Morphogenesis|genetic]] method); a point of view influenced by Hettner. In 1914 he undertook his first private field trip to [[Peru]], but cancelled his trip in [[Chile]] to participate in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Bähr, J., Stewig, R. (1981): Beiträge zur Theorie und Methode der Länderkunde: Oskar Schmieder zum Gedenken. Universität Kiel.&lt;/ref&gt;

His first travel to Latin America was crucial for his later career. After his ''[[Habilitation]]'' under [[Alfred Philippson]] in Bonn in 1919, with a study on the [[settlement geography]] of [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]] in central Spain, he travelled again to Latin America. Before arriving in Peru and Chile, however, he became a professor of [[mineralogy]] and [[geology]] at the [[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba]], [[Argentina]], where he remained from 1920 to 1925. Influenced by his mentor [[Alfred Hettner]], who worked on the Colombian Andes, his regional focus was appreciated at the University of California at Berkeley where he worked with [[Carl O. Sauer]] as a Visiting Professor (1925) and Associate Professor (until 1930) (replacing [[Richard Russel]]),&lt;ref&gt;Kenzer, M. (1987): Carl O. Sauer, a tribute. Oregon State University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  and contributed the Latin Americanist focus—and probably German geographic methodology&lt;ref&gt;Robinson DJ. (1980): Studying Latin America: Essays in Honor of Preston E. James. Syracuse University&lt;/ref&gt;—to the development of the [[Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography|Berkeley School]].&lt;ref&gt;West, RC. (1979): Carl Sauer's Fieldwork in Latin America. Syracuse University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kent, R., Soriano Marti, J. (2005): Bridging Cultural Geographies: Europe and Latin America. Universitat Jaume I.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they carried out research in [[Baja California]]. During this time, he taught courses in Latin American regional geography visited by [[Fred B. Kniffen]],&lt;ref&gt;DeVivo, M. (2014): Leadership in American Academic Geography: The Twentieth Century. Lexington Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel N. Dicken]],&lt;ref&gt;Martin, G. (2015): Geographers: Biobibliographical Studies. Bloomsbury.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julian Steward]],&lt;ref&gt;Kerns, V. (2010): Scenes from the High Desert. University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Although Sauer offered him the position of a Full Professor, Schmieder decided to go back to Germany. After Schmieder's departure, Sauer himself began to offer seminars on Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, H. (2008): Looking South: The Evolution of Latin Americanist Scholarship in the United States, 1850-1975. University of Alabama Press.&lt;/ref&gt; yet followed more or less the Länderkunde format of Schmieder, as [[James J. Parsons]] lines out: {{Quote| I was one of his teaching assistants. Sauer's North America course, relentlessly historical, had Daniel Boone "peeping over the crest of the Appalachians" at the term's final lecture. For Latin America he more or less followed the format used by Oscar Schmieder in his Länderkunde with a major concern for aboriginal and colonial geography.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, JJ. (1979): The Later Sauer Years. Annals of the Association of American Geographers [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2569540]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Back to Germany in 1930, he became a professor of geography at the [[University of Kiel]], where he continued his work on Latin America with his disciple and assistant [[Herbert Wilhelmy]]. He soon adopted the then dominating [[nationalist]]/[[national socialist]] mode of thinking, became an admirer of the colonial policies of Fascist Italy, contributed to national socialist ''[[Lebensraum]]'' research, and became a member of the [[NSDAP]] in 1941. {{Quote|Spurred by the Italian example, the German scholar advocated an enormous population transfer between South America and the ‘Dark Continent’: no less than 200,000 of the 1.2 million people of German origin Schmieder had identified in his scholarly work as living in Argentina and Brazil were to be relocated to Africa in the near future. In his radical plans he felt backed by Hitler, who also supported the return of ethnic Germans living in the Americas to the Volksgemeinschaft.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard P. (2013): Borrowing from Mussolini: Nazi Germany's Colonial Aspirations in the Shadow of Italian Expansionism. The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03086534.2013.836358]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After a period at the [[University of Halle]], he went back to Kiel. In the 1950s, he was a Visiting Professor at the [[University of Karachi]] and the [[University of Chile]]. In a 1967 volume of the Pakistan Geographical Review he was described as "one of the very senior geographers, a chapter in German geography, an image of Hettner, and a successful writer. He is one of the associates of Berkeley school of geography, founded by Carl Sauer". Schmieder was a convinced representative of ''Länderkunde'' [[regional geography]].

The Commonwealth of Australia comprises the mainland of the Australian continent, plus the major island of [[Tasmania]], and other nearby islands.&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=2 July 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html|title=Australia|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The neighbouring countries are [[Indonesia]], [[East Timor]], and [[Papua New Guinea]] to the north, the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[New Caledonia]] to the north-east, and [[New Zealand]] to the south-east.

The Australian mainland has been inhabited for more than 60,000 years by [[Indigenous Australians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.softpedia.com/news/Both-Aborigines-and-Europeans-Rooted-in-Africa-54225.shtml Both Australian Aborigines and Europeans Rooted in Africa – 50,000 years ago]&lt;/ref&gt; After sporadic visits by fishermen from the north and then European discovery by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] explorers in 1606,&lt;ref&gt;MacKnight, CC (1976).''The Voyage to Marege: Macassan Trepangers in Northern Australia.''

The terms '''''podunk''''' or '''''Podunk Hollow''''' in [[American English]] denote or describe an insignificant, out-of-the-way, or fictitious town.&lt;ref name="Nick Bacon 2013"&gt;Nick Bacon. "Podunk After Pratt: Place and Placelessness in East Hartford, CT." In ''Confronting Urban Legacy: Rediscovering Hartford and New England’s Forgotten Cities.'' Xiangming Chen and Nick Bacon (eds). Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used in the upper case as a [[placeholder name]], to indicate insignificance and lack of importance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Read, Allen 1939. "The Rationale of Podunk." ''American Speech'' 14(2): 99-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''[[wikt:podunk|podunk]]'' is of [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] origin. It denoted both the [[Podunk people]] and marshy locations, particularly the people's winter village site on the border of present-day [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford]] and [[South Windsor, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="Nick Bacon 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, John. 1982. "If this is Podunk, it is truly nowhere", ''Hartford Courant,'' May 30, pg. E6.&lt;/ref&gt; Podunk was first defined in an American national dictionary in 1934, as an imaginary small town considered typical of placid dullness and lack of contact with the progress of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, Jim. 2007. “Proud to be Podunk!” ''Hartford Courant,'' Jan 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest citation in the ''[[Dictionary of American Regional English]]'' is from [[Samuel Griswold Goodrich]]'s 1840 book, ''The Politician of Podunk:'' 
:Solomon Waxtend was a shoemaker of Podunk, a small village of New York some forty years ago.

The book portrays Waxtend as being drawn by his interest in [[public policy|public affairs]] into becoming a representative in the [[New York State Assembly|General Assembly]], finding himself unsuited to the role, and returning to his trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThcUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA109-IA2&amp;lpg=PA109-IA2&amp;dq=%22politician+of+podunk%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6o1WiqWsA5&amp;sig=OODdWiECEj8TLeV-72hlt5qPFYo |title=Token |first=Samuel Griswold |last=Goodrich |publisher=Gray And Bowen |year=1840 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether the author intended to evoke more than [[Podunk, Ulysses, New York|the place near Ulysses, New York]] by the name "Podunk". Possibly the term was meant to exemplify "plain, honest people", as opposed to more sophisticated people with questionable values. An 1875 description said:
:Sometimes the newest State, or the youngest county or town of a State is nicknamed "Old Podunk," or whatever it may be, by its affectionate inhabitants, as though their home was an ancient figure in national history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Old North State |publisher=The New York Times |date=May 21, 1875 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American discourse, the term podunk came into general colloquial use, through the wide national readership of the "Letters from Podunk" of 1846, in the ''[[Daily National Pilot]]'' of [[Buffalo, New York]]. These represented "Podunk" as a real place but one insignificant and out of the way.&lt;ref&gt;Read, Allen 1939 "The Rationale of Podunk." ''American Speech'' 14(2): 99-108.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term gained currency as standing for a fictional place. For instance, in 1869, [[Mark Twain]] wrote the article, "Mr. Beecher and the Clergy," defending his friend, [[Thomas Kinnicut Beecher|Thomas K. Beecher]], whose preaching had come under criticism.  In it he said:
: They even know it in Podunk, wherever that may be. It excited a two-line paragraph there.
At the time he was living in Buffalo, moving to [[Hartford, Connecticut]] in 1871, in a home within {{convert|4|mi|km}} of the Podunk River. [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]], where Twain had lived earlier, is within {{convert|30|mi|km}} of Podunk, New York, so it is not clear to which village Twain was referring.

The '''Poles of Cold''' are the places in the [[Southern hemisphere|southern]] and [[Northern hemisphere|northern]] hemispheres where the lowest air [[temperature]]s have been recorded.

==Southern hemisphere==
[[File:LakeVostok-Location.jpg|thumb|Lake Vostok composite image ([[NASA]])]]

In the southern hemisphere, the Pole of Cold is currently located in [[Antarctica]], at the [[Russia]]n (formerly [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]) Antarctic station [[Vostok, Antarctica|Vostok]] at {{coord|78|28|S|106|48|E|name=Vostok}}. On July 21, 1983, this station recorded a temperature of {{convert|-89.2|C}}. This is the lowest naturally occurring temperature ever recorded on Earth. Vostok station is located at the elevation of {{convert|3488|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, far removed from the moderating influence of oceans (more than {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} from the nearest sea coast), and high latitude that results in almost three months of [[civil polar night]] every year (early May to end of July), all combine to produce an environment where temperatures rarely rise above {{convert|-25|C}} during summer and frequently fall below {{convert|-70|C}} in winter. By comparison, the [[South Pole]], due to its lower elevation, is, on average, {{convert|5|to|10|C-change|0}} warmer than Vostok, and the lowest temperature ever recorded at the South Pole is {{convert|-82.8|C|0}}.

It is generally thought that Vostok is not the coldest place in Antarctica, and there are locations (notably, [[Dome A]]) that are modestly colder on average. The now inactive [[Plateau Station]], located on the central Antarctic plateau, recorded an average yearly temperature that was consistently lower than that of Vostok Station during the 37-month period that it was active in the late 1960s, with its average for the coldest month being several degrees lower than the same statistic for Vostok. Plateau Station never recorded a temperature that surpassed the record low set at Vostok. However, temperatures at Plateau Station were only recorded during the 37 months that it was active. Had a lower temperature than the Vostok record occurred there at a later date, it would never have been recorded.

Monitoring stations in Antarctica are few and far between; prior to 1995, Vostok was the only research station on the [[Antarctic Plateau]] above the elevation of 3,000 m (with the exception of Plateau Station during the brief period that it was active in the 1960s), with no other stations for several hundred kilometers in any direction. Temperatures below {{convert|-89.2|C}}, if they did occur elsewhere, would not have been recorded. The automatic weather station at Dome A was only installed in 2005, and has recorded {{convert|-82.5|C}} as the coldest so far (2010). However a review of satellite measurements taken between 2010–2013 found several places located along a ridge between [[Dome A]] and [[Dome F]] which recorded even lower temperatures of {{convert|-92|to|-94|C}}, with the lowest reliable temperature being {{convert|-93.2|C}} recorded in 2010, at {{coord|-81.8|59.3|format=dms}}, at an elevation of {{convert|3900|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The extreme low temperatures are found in hollows slightly below the peak of the ice ridge, where cold air gets trapped as it flows downhill, and since the same low temperature ranges were detected at several different sites along the ridge across multiple years, it is thought this may be the lowest temperature achievable under local atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25287806 Coldest spot on Earth identified by satellite.

== Northern hemisphere ==
In the northern hemisphere, there are two places in the [[Sakha Republic]] (Yakutia), [[Siberia]], [[Russia]] that vie for the honour of being considered the "Pole of Cold" in winter. These are [[Verkhoyansk]] (located at {{coord|67|33|N|133|23|E|name=Verkhoyansk}}) and [[Oymyakon]] (located at {{coord|63|15|N|143|9|E|name=Oymyakon}}).

In December 1868 and then in February 1869 [[:ru:Худяков, Иван Александрович|Ivan Khudyakov]] made the discovery of the Northern Pole of Cold by measuring a record temperature of {{convert|-63.2|C|1}} in Verkhoyansk. Later, on January 15, 1885, a temperature of {{convert|-67.8|C|1}} was registered there by [[:ru:Ковалик, Сергей Филиппович|Sergey Kovalik]]. This measurement was published in the ''Annals of the General Physical Observatory'' in 1892; by mistake it was written as {{convert|-69.8|C}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|author=N.A. Stepanova 
|title=On the Lowest Temperatures on Earth
|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/086/mwr-086-01-0006.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was later corrected. One can still find this incorrect value in some literature. The coldest reliably measured temperature in Verkhoyansk was {{convert|-67.6|C|1}} on February 5 and 7 of 1892.

In 1924, Russian scientist Sergey Obruchev registered the lowest temperature {{convert|−71.2|C}}.
On February&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;1933, a temperature of {{convert|-67.7|C|1}} was recorded at Oymyakon's weather station.&lt;ref name="wmo"&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://wmo.asu.edu/northern-hemisphere-lowest-temperature

 |archivedate = 2012-04-20
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the coldest reliably measured temperature for the [[Northern Hemisphere]].  The weather station is in a valley between Oymyakon and [[Tomtor, Oymyakonsky District, Sakha Republic|Tomtor]]. The station is at {{convert|750|m|ft|abbr=on}} and the surrounding mountains at {{convert|1100|m|ft|abbr=on}}, causing cold air to pool in the valley: recent studies show that winter temperatures in the area ''increase'' with elevation by as much as {{convert|10|C-change}}.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.igsoc.org/annals/v52/58/a58A068.pdf Response of glaciers in the Suntar-Khayata Range, eastern Siberia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The small rural locality of [[Delyankir]], also in the Sakha Republic, has a lower average temperature throughout all winter months than either Oymyakon or Verkhoyansk, as well as a lower yearly average. Its record low temperature of {{convert|−65|C|F}} is slightly higher than the record lows set at Oymyakon and Verkhoyansk, however.

A '''position line''' is a line that can be identified both on a [[nautical chart]] or [[aeronautical chart]] and by observation out on the surface of the [[earth]]. The intersection of two position lines is a [[fix (position)|fix]] that is used in [[position fixing]] to identify the navigator's location.

There are several types of position line:
* [[Compass]] [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] - the [[angle]] between [[north]] and the line passing through the compass and the point of interest
* [[Navigational transit|Transit]]  - a line passing through the observer and two other reference points
* [[Leading line]] - the line passing through two marks indicating a safe channel
* [[Leading lights]] - the line passing through two beacons indicating a safe channel
* [[Sector light]]s – the lines created by masked coloured lights that indicate a safe channel

'''RV ''Rachel Carson''''' is a research vessel owned and operated by the [[University of Maryland]]'s Center for Environmental Science, named in honor of the marine biologist and writer [[Rachel Carson]].

The 81-foot aluminum-hulled vessel is an extended and modified Challenger class fast research vessel, designed by marine architect Roger Long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmsnet.com/rv_design.htm |title=Research Vessel Design |work=JMS Naval Architects &amp; Salvage Engineers |year=2012 |accessdate=21 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107205725/http://jmsnet.com/rv_design.htm |archivedate=7 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is equipped with twin 1,200 horsepower diesel engines and water jet drives which give a maximum speed of 24 knots. A [[Dynamic positioning|dynamic positioning system]] automatically maintains the vessel's position.&lt;ref name="umces"/&gt;

The ship was built by [[Hike Metal Products]] of [[Wheatley, Ontario]],&lt;ref name="umces"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.umces.edu/research-discovery/rv-rachel-carson |title=The R/V Rachel Carson |work=University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science |year=2012 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of $4.6 million, and christened by [[Katie O'Malley]] on November 16, 2008, at [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mdsg.umd.edu/CQ/V07N4/side3/ |title=New R/V Rachel Carson Commissioned |work=Chesapeake Quarterly |year=2008 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rachel Carson'' has operated in [[Chesapeake Bay]] since early 2009, teaching estuarine sampling techniques, carrying out water quality surveys, [[plankton]] collection, [[Box corer|box coring]] operations, and deploying instrument packages.&lt;ref name="umces"/&gt;

The '''University of Edgestow''' is a fictional university which appears in the novel ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]]. It is a small collegiate institution, dating back to at least the 14th Century. It has four colleges:

* '''Bracton College'''
* '''Northumberland College'''
* '''Dukes College'''
* '''St. Elizabeth's College''' (the only ladies' college)

Some commentators{{who|date=December 2012}} have suggested that it may be based on [[Durham University]], to which it bears certain similarities. However, Lewis denied any connection with Durham (a university of which he was fond) and close examination show the similarities to be superficial: Edgestow is a medieval foundation, a third "Oxbridge" university, while Durham was founded in the early 19th Century (though some of its buildings are indeed medieval). Bracton College (where much of the novel's story takes place) is a fellows-only institution, which was probably based on [[All Souls College, Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==History==
The University has an ancient history, some details of which are lost. It suffered during the English Civil War, when Roundheads killed at least one Royalist don. Less clear details, from further back in history, indicate that Bragdon Wood – the grounds of Bracton College – is the location of the grave of [[Merlin]].

The novel begins after the [[Second World War]], when the British government establishes the National Institute of Co-ordinated Experiments (N.I.C.E.), which is intended to bring to the problems of peace the same scientific organization which had won the war. Bracton College is keen to persuade the N.I.C.E. to base itself in Edgestow, and succeeds in selling them a site including a large part of Bragdon Wood&lt;!-- not Bracton Wood--&gt; – an action which attracts some controversy. Extensive building works cause more disruption than had been anticipated, and disorder leads to the appointment of [[Lord Feverstone]], a leading N.I.C.E. official and fellow of Bracton College, as Emergency Commissioner.

At the climax of the novel, a large part of the town, including the whole of Bracton College, is destroyed in a freak natural disaster. The exact nature of this disaster remains unspecified, but the description includes earthquakes and subterranean explosions. Extraordinary numbers of residents leave shortly before this happens, for reasons ranging from coincidental (one resident receives a telegram from a relative) to portentous (various residents report animals telling them to leave). Lord Feverstone, however, dies in the disaster.

The Sub-warden of Bracton, Dr. Curry, has a narrow escape from the disaster. As the only surviving fellow (aside from Mark Studdock who was deemed to have resigned) he anticipates becoming the new Warden of Bracton College and playing a key role in the rebuilding of the university. However, it is unknown whether any of these ambitions are actually fulfilled, as the story ends shortly after the Edgestow disaster.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1043">In France, a '''pôle urbain''' is a statistical area defined by [[INSEE]] (France's national statistics office) for the measurement of contiguously built-up areas. It shares the same definition as a ''[[unité urbaine]]'' ("[[urban area]]"), but differing in that it is not contained within the ''couronne périurbaine'' ([[commuter belt]]) of any other ''pôle urbain''; in other words, a ''pôle urbain'' is an [[urban area]] that is a core of demographic growth. Please see ''[[unité urbaine]]'' and ''[[aire urbaine]]'' for more detail.

'''Ågestasjön''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] for "Lake of Ågesta") is a small [[lake]] in [[Huddinge Municipality]] south of [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].

Ågestasjön forms part of the [[Tyresån Lake System]] and, with a [[biodiversity]] unique in the Stockholm region, is highly popular among [[Birdwatching|birdwatchers]] and [[ornithology|ornithologists]].  The lake also forms part of the [[Orlången Nature Reserve]] and one of the [[green wedge]]s stretching into central Stockholm.&lt;ref name="Huddinge-Ågesta" /&gt;

The lakes receives water from Lake [[Trehörningen (Sjödalen)|Trehörningen]] and in its northern end empties into [[Magelungen]].  For a brief history of the area see [[Trehörningen (Sjödalen)|Trehörningen]].

== Catchment area ==
[[Image:Wetland in Ågestasjön in spring 2008-1.jpg|thumb|left|The wetlands surrounding Ågestasjön.]]
The lake and the wetlands around it was transformed into a bird [[Protected area|protection area]] in 1976, which means the area is inaccessible to the public from April 15 to July 15 and hunting, hunting equipment, and dogs are prohibited all seasons.  Most of the area within a radius of 300 metres from the lake is subject to special restrictions.&lt;ref name="Huddinge-Ågesta" /&gt;

Except for birdwatchers, the lake and its surrounding also attracts open-air lovers who use the area for walking, [[tour skating]], and [[cross-country skiing]].  Due to the restrictions on visiting the lake in summer, and to the considerable amount of aquatic plants, bathing is not possible in the lake.  Additionally, motorboats and fishing are not allowed on the lake.&lt;ref name="Huddinge-Ågesta" /&gt;

The lake is surrounded by agricultural lands and a variety of forests, including precious [[deciduous]] forest.  Near the lake is a [[golf course]] and a [[riding school]].  Part of the biodiversity in the area is due to the bait animals kept around the lake.&lt;ref name="Huddinge-smultron"&gt;Huddinge Municipality, ''Hitta ditt smultronställe...''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental impact ===
Ågestasjön receives nutrients and contaminants from both lakes upstream, the [[Orlången]] and [[Trehörningen (Sjödalen)|Trehörningen]], and Ågestasjön's proper catchment area which is rich in nutrients.  In the northern end of the lake superficial sediments (0–2&amp;nbsp;cm) contain high levels of [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[nickel]], [[lead]], [[cadmium]], and [[Manganese]]; while the southern part of the lake show high levels of [[Chromium]] in deeper sediments (20–22&amp;nbsp;cm).  Overall, levels of [[heavy metals]] are considered moderate.&lt;ref name="Huddinge-Ågesta" /&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
[[Image:Betula pendula at Ågestasjön in spring 2008-1.JPG|thumb|[[Betula pendula|Silver Birch]] near Ågestasjön.]]
In 1998, a wide range of aquatic plants were documented in the lake: [[Phragmites|reed]], [[Scirpus|common club-rush]]&lt;!--- Säv, Schoenoplectus lacustris ---&gt;, [[Typha latifolia|common bulrush]], [[Typha angustifolia|lesser bulrush]], [[Iris pseudacorus|yellow iris]], [[alisma]], [[Sparganium|branched bur-reed]], [[Cicuta virosa|water hemlock]], [[Calla|marsh calla]], [[Stratiotes|water-soldier]], [[Nuphar lutea|yellow water-lily]], [[Nymphaea alba|white water-lily]], [[Potamogeton|broad-leaved pondweed]], [[Potamogeton|blunt-leaved pondweed]], [[Myriophyllum verticillatum|whorled water-milfoil]], [[Ceratophyllum demersum|rigid hornwort]], [[Utricularia vulgaris|common bladderwort]], [[Elodea canadensis|pondweed]], [[Menyanthes|bog-bean]], [[Hydrocharis morsus-ranae|frogbit]], [[Lemna minor|lesser duckweed]], [[Spirodela polyrhiza|greater duckweed]], and [[Lemna trisulca|ivy-leaved duckweed]].&lt;ref name="Huddinge-Ågesta" /&gt;

Common fishes in the lake includes [[Northern pike|pike]], [[Rutilus|roach]], [[rudd]], [[tench]], [[Common bleak|bleak]], [[Blicca bjoerkna|silver bream]], [[carp bream]], [[crucian carp]], [[European perch|perch]], and [[ruffe]].  Of these tench and crucian carp represent the majority of biomass in the lake, while roach and perch dominated in numbers.  Large fishes dominate in the lake, which is considered as a sign of presence of carnivores.  A considerable variation in sizes of roaches indicates the lake is an important breeding locale for this species.  In contrast, perches show a small variation in scale, which is a sign of the lake being dominated by a single generation as individuals fail to reach carnivorous adulthood.&lt;ref name="Huddinge-Ågesta" /&gt;

Some 240 bird species have been reported by the lake, which is an important locale for both resting and breeding species.  The lake is dominated by some 500 couples of [[black-headed gull]]s together with [[mallard]]s and [[Eurasian coot|coots]].
5 couples of [[great crested grebe]], 5-10 couples of [[Common teal|teal]] and [[Common goldeneye|goldeneye]], 5 couples of [[tufted duck]] and [[Common pochard|pochard]], a few couples of [[Common moorhen|moorhen]] and [[water rail]], and single couples of [[Northern shoveler|shoveler]], [[gadwall]], [[garganey]].  A presence of [[whooper swan]] dates back to 2004, while regular visitors include [[marsh harrier]] (2-3 couples), [[Common snipe|snipe]], and [[Eurasian woodcock]].  Occasionally [[Eurasian bittern]] and [[spotted crake]] are seen by the lake.&lt;ref name="Huddinge-Ågesta" /&gt;

There are a dozen couples of [[northern lapwing]] and [[Motacilla flava|eastern yellow wagtail]], together with couples of [[meadow pipit]], [[whinchat]], [[red-backed shrike]], [[bearded reedling]], [[Northern goshawk|goshawk]], [[spotted nutcracker]], [[Eurasian wryneck]], [[European honey buzzard]], [[thrush nightingale]], [[long-tailed tit]], [[lesser spotted woodpecker]], [[wood warbler]], [[hawfinch]], and [[Eurasian hobby]]. In the night time [[sedge warbler]] and [[reed warbler]] are regularly heard, while [[grasshopper warbler]], [[river warbler]], [[marsh warbler]], and [[great reed warbler]] are reported now and then. [[Osprey]] are regularly seen fishing in the lake.  Uncountable numbers of resting species are reported by the lake, including various [[swan]]s, [[Buteoninae|hawks]], [[eagle]]s, [[cormorant]]s, and [[sparrow]]s.&lt;ref name="Huddinge-Ågesta" /&gt;

Both the lakes upstream and downstream suffered of [[crayfish plague]] in the late 1970s, which makes it likely Ågestasjön was affected too.  As [[signal crayfish]] was introduced in the neighbouring lakes recently, it is assumed they are also present in Ågestasjön. [[Amphibian]]s are represented by [[moor frog]], [[common frog]], [[true toad]], and [[smooth newt]].  There are several [[bat]]s present by the lake: [[northern bat]], [[Daubenton's bat]], [[common noctule]], and [[whiskered bat]].  [[Otter]]s were present in the lake until the 1960s and were spotted nearby in 2003.&lt;ref name="Huddinge-Ågesta" /&gt;
