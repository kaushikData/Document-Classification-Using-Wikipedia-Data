Among other things, requested the Association to help friends, called "Brothers," on the one hand they are very moral but on the other financially weak. Help included assistance in finding jobs, and providing [[credit (finance)|credit]].

Fraternity brothers are divided into four different levels, ranging from 'trainees' are "following siblings learn the theory of brotherhood" to 'educate' they "There are those who go to the fraternity of complete self-forgetfulness. They have no calculates interest on themselves when they give their hands brotherhood, not later, not any time any day, but always they feel only the second and always are willing to give themselves and dedicate themselves for the other. few are unique individuals but this fraternity Hasmonean. role of these brotherhood serve as a symbol to others and play are without intention special role of educators".

==Association Activity==

In recent decades, the association activity in Israel almost completely diminished and most of the activities currently being branches in [[Australia]], [[England]], [[Argentina]], [[United States]], [[Brazil]], [[South Africa]], [[France]] and [[Canada]].

The '''American Missionary Association''' ('''AMA''') was a [[Protestant]]-based [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] group founded on September 3, 1846, in [[Albany, New York]]. The main purpose of the organization was [[Abolitionism|abolition]] of slavery, education of [[African American]]s, promotion of racial equality, and spreading Christian values. Its members and leaders were of both races; The Association was chiefly sponsored by the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalist]] churches in New England. Starting in 1861, it opened camps in the South for former slaves. It played a major role during the [[Reconstruction Era]] in promoting education for blacks in the South by establishing numerous schools and colleges, as well as paying for teachers. 

==History==
The American Missionary Association was started by members of the [[American Home Missionary Society]] (AHMS) and the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] (ABCFM), who were disappointed that their first organizations refused to take stands against slavery and accepted contributions from slaveholders. From the beginning the leadership was integrated: the first board was made up of 12 men, four of them black.&lt;ref name="DeBoer"/&gt; One of its primary objectives was to abolish slavery. The AMA (American Missionary Association) was one of the organizations responsible for pushing slavery onto the national political agenda.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The organization started the ''American Missionary'' magazine, published from 1846 through 1934.  ([[Cornell University]] Library has editions accessible online in its ''Making of America'' digital library.&lt;ref name="Making of America"&gt;[http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/a/amis "The Missionary Magazine" (1878-1901)], ''Making of America'', Cornell University Library, accessed 3 Mar 2009&lt;/ref&gt;) 

Among the AMA's achievements was the founding of anti-slavery churches. For instance, the abolitionist [[Owen Lovejoy]] was among the Congregational ministers of the AMA who helped start 115 anti-slavery churches in Illinois before the [[American Civil War]], aided by the strong westward migration of population to that area.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton H. Johnson, "The Amistad Incident and the Formation of the American Missionary Association", ''New Conversations,'' Vol. XI (Winter/Spring 1989), pp. 3-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qMEv8DNXVbIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Paul Simon, "Preface", Owen Lovejoy, ''His Brother's Blood: Speeches and Writings, 1838-1864''], edited by William Frederick Moore and Jane Anne Moore, University of Illinois Press, 2004, accessed 27 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Another member, Rev. [[Mansfield French]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] who became a Methodist, helped found [[Wilberforce University]] in Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drbronsontours.com/bronsonrevmansfieldfrench.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the AMA began their support of education for blacks before the Civil War, and they recruited teachers for the numerous [[contraband]] camps that developed in Union-occupied territory in the South during the war. Rev. French was assigned to [[Port Royal, South Carolina]] and went on a speaking tour with [[Robert Smalls]], who famously escaped enslavement, as well as met with President Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, jointly convincing them to allow blacks to serve in the Union military.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Dray, Capitol Men (Houghton Mifflin Company 2008) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; By war's end, Union forces had organized 100 contraband camps, and many had AMA teachers. The AMA also served the [[Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony]] (1863–1867). Located on an island occupied by Union troops, the colony was intended to be self-sustaining.  It was supervised by [[Horace James]], a Congregational chaplain appointed by the Army as "Superintendent for Negro Affairs in the North Carolina District". The first of 27 teachers who volunteered through the AMA was his cousin, Elizabeth James.&lt;ref name="learnNC"/&gt;  By 1864 the colony had more than 2200 residents, and both children and adults filled the classrooms in the several one-room schools, as they were eager for learning. The missionary teachers also evangelized and helped provide the limited medical care of the time.&lt;ref name="learnNC"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110929200613/http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-civilwar/4590 "The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony"], provided by National Park Service, at North Carolina Digital History: LEARN NC, accessed 11 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction==
{{Further|African-American Civil Rights Movement (1865–95)}}
The AMA's pace of founding schools and colleges increased during and after the war. Freedmen, historically free blacks (many of whom were of mixed race), and white sympathizers alike believed that education was a priority for the newly freed people. Altogether, "the AMA founded more than five hundred schools and colleges for the freedmen of the South during and after the Civil War, spending more money for that purpose than the Freedmen's Bureau of the federal government."&lt;ref name="DeBoer"/&gt;

Among the eleven colleges they founded were [[Berea College]] and [[Clark Atlanta University|Atlanta University]], (1865); [[Fisk University]], (1866); [[Hampton Institute]] (1868) and [[Tougaloo College]] (1869); [[Dillard University]], [[Talladega College]], LeMoyne/[[LeMoyne-Owen College]], Tillotson/[[Huston-Tillotson University]], and Avery Normal Institute (1867) (now part of the [[College of Charleston]]). Together with the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands|Freedmen's Bureau]], the AMA founded [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1867. 

In addition, the AMA organized the [[Freedmen's Aid Society]], which recruited northern teachers for the schools and arranged to find housing for them in the South.

In the mid-1870s, white Democrats began to regain control of state legislatures through violence and intimidation at the polls that suppressed Republican voting. The Association expressed disappointment at the failures of the Reconstruction Era but never wavered in opposing disenfranchisement and continued the struggle over the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4CDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=American+Missionary+Association+said+black+suffrage+failed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BNN660HCcT&amp;sig=uQX-xLaQlB3QKyET5__Q1Dcy2tQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA2__b89jZAhUNZKwKHb19CJ4Q6AEIeDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20Missionary%20Association%20said%20black%20suffrage%20failed&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1988), p. 527&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1870s, the AMA national office had relocated to [[New York City]]. Its magazine, ''American Missionary'', had a circulation of 20,000 in the 19th century, ten times that of the abolitionist [[William Lloyd Garrison|William Garrison]]'s magazine.&lt;ref name="DeBoer"&gt;[http://www.ucc.org/about-us/hidden-histories/blacks-and-the-american.html Clara Merritt DeBoer, "Blacks and the American Missionary Association"], United Church of Christ, 1973, accessed 12 Jan 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cornell University]] Library has editions from 1878-1901 accessible online in its ''Making of America'' digital library.&lt;ref name="Making of America"/&gt;

While the AMA became notable in the United States with its work in opposition to slavery and in support of education for freedmen, it also sponsored and maintained missions in numerous nations overseas. The 19th-century missionary effort was strong in India, China and east Asia. It was strongly supported by Congregational and Christian churches. Over time, the association became most closely aligned with the [[Congregational Christian Churches]], established in 1931 as a union between those two groups of churches. 

Most of those congregations became members of the [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC) in the late 20th century. The AMA maintained a distinct and independent identity until 1999, when a restructuring of the UCC merged it into the Justice and Witness Ministries division.

The records of the American Missionary Association are housed at the [[Amistad Research Center]], located at [[Tulane University]] in New Orleans.

Soon after, Moyers transferred to the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he wrote for ''[[The Daily Texan]]'' newspaper. In 1956, he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Journalism. While in Austin, Moyers served as assistant news editor for KTBC [[KLBJ-AM|radio]] and [[KTBC (TV)|television]] stations, owned by [[Lady Bird Johnson]], wife of then-Senator Johnson.

===Kennedy and Johnson administrations===
During the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy Administration]], Moyers was first appointed as associate director of public affairs for the newly created [[Peace Corps]] in 1961. He served as Deputy Director from 1962 to 1963.  When [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] took office after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy assassination]], Moyers became a special assistant to Johnson, serving from 1963 to 1967.

Johnson#Love Field, Dallas|first inauguration on Air Force One]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} He played a key role in organizing and supervising the 1964 [[Great Society]] legislative task forces and was a principal architect of Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign. Moyers acted as the President's informal chief of staff from October 1964 until 1966. From July 1965 to February 1967, he also served as [[White House press secretary]].&lt;ref name="library"/&gt;

After the resignation of White House Chief of Staff [[Walter Jenkins]] because of a sexual misdemeanor in the run up to the [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964 election]], President [[Lyndon B.

Moyers also sought information from the FBI on the sexual preferences of White House staff members, most notably [[Jack Valenti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/investigations/documents/Moyers.pdf|format=PDF|title=Letter to Bill Moyers from FBI – December 2, 1964|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=February 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moyers indicated his memory was unclear on why Johnson directed him to request such information, "but that he may have been simply looking for details of allegations first brought to the president by [[J.

[[Image:MoyersPress-small.jpg|270px|thumbnail|right|Moyers giving a press conference at the [[White House]] in 1965]]
Journalist [[Morley Safer]] in his 1990 book "Flashbacks" wrote that Moyers and President Johnson met with and "harangued" Safer's boss, [[CBS]] president [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]], about Safer's coverage of the Marines torching [[Cam Ne]] village in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="safer1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The U.S. Government and the Vietnam War: Executive and Legislative Roles and Relationships|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W3fy6AABBXsC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69|last=Gibbons|first=William Conrad|year=1995|pages=69pp|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-00635-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the meeting, Safer alleges, Johnson threatened to expose Safer's "communist ties". This was a bluff, according to Safer. Safer says that Moyers was "if not a key player, certainly a key bystander" in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/12151-1/Morley+Safer.aspx|title=Booknotes: Flashbacks On Returning to Vietnam|publisher=booknotes.org|accessdate=February 28, 2009|quote=And Moyers was present during some of this showdown stuff about me being a Communist, clearly knew it was a bluff.

W. Bush|Bush]] were behind Safer's 1990 allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/113557171.html?dids=113557171:113557171&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT|title=Is ill will behind piece `60 Minutes' plans to do on PBS' Bill Moyers?|website=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=February 28, 2009|quote=Mr. Moyers wonders aloud whether his hard-hitting coverage of presidents Reagan and Bush has vexed Mr. Wallace and Mr. Safer, who, friends say, have become more politically conservative as they've grown older and wealthier.|first=Marc|last=Gunther|date=May 29, 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times]]'' on April 3, 1966, Moyers offered this insight on his stint as press secretary to President Johnson: "I work for him despite his faults and he lets me work for him despite my deficiencies."&lt;ref name="numbertwotexan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Patrick |title=No. 2 Texan in the White House|pages=SM1|newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 3, 1966 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/04/03/archives/no-2-texan-in-the-white-house-no-2-texan-in-the-white-house.html?nytmobile=0 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simpsonsquotations"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson |first=James B. |title=Simpson's Contemporary Quotations, No. 848 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1988 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/63/48/848.html |isbn=0-395-43085-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205105522/http://www.bartleby.com/63/48/848.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 17, 1967, he told an audience in Cambridge that Johnson saw the war in Vietnam as his major legacy and, as a result, was insisting on victory at all costs, even in the face of public opposition. Moyers felt such a continuation of the conflict would tear the country apart. "I never thought the situation could arise when I would wish for the defeat of LBJ, and that makes my current state of mind all the more painful to me," he told them. "I would have to say now: It would depend on who his opponent is."&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Ellsberg]], ''Secrets'', 197f&lt;/ref&gt;

The full details of his rift with Johnson have not been made public but may be discussed in a forthcoming memoir.&lt;ref name="pulpitwithsermons"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=David|title=Moyers Leaves a Public Affairs Pulpit With Sermons to Spare|work=The New York Times|date=December 17, 2004|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/17/arts/television/17moye.html?ex=1261026000&amp;en=e634685e55090435&amp;ei=5090|accessdate=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalism===

====''Newsday''====
Moyers served as publisher for the [[Long Island, New York]] daily newspaper ''[[Newsday]]'' from 1967 to 1970. The conservative publication had been unsuccessful,&lt;ref name="CHAH"&gt;"Bill Moyers." Contemporary Heroes and Heroines, Book IV. Gale Group, 2000. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but Moyers led the paper in a progressive direction,&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Biography|page=215|author=Gale Research|isbn=0-7876-2551-5|year=1998|publisher=Gale Research|location=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing in leading writers such as [[Pete Hamill]], [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], and [[Saul Bellow]], and adding new features and more investigative reporting and analysis. Circulation increased and the publication won 33 major journalism awards, including two [[Pulitzer Prize]]s.&lt;ref name="CHAH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Bill Moyers." Newsmakers 1991, Issue Cumulation.

====''Bill Moyers Journal''====
In 1971 he began working for the Public Broadcasting System ([[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]), hosting a [[news program]] called ''[[Bill Moyers Journal]]'', which ran until 1981 with a hiatus from 1976 to 1977, and then again from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref name="mbcprofile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Moyers, Bill: U.S. Broadcast Journalist|publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/moyesrbill/moyersbill.htm|accessdate=June 7, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608195913/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/moyesrbill/moyersbill.htm|archivedate=June 8, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CBS News====
In 1976 he moved to [[CBS]], where he worked as editor and chief correspondent for ''CBS Reports'' until 1980, then as senior news analyst and commentator for the ''[[CBS Evening News]] with [[Dan Rather]]'' from 1981 to 1986. He was the last regular commentator for the network broadcast.&lt;ref name="opinionsdifferoncbs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shister |first=Gail |title=Opinions Differ on CBS News' Commentary Plan |website=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=April 18, 2006 |url=http://www.freepress.net/news/15028 |accessdate=June 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190512/http://www.freepress.net/news/15028 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his last year at CBS, Moyers made public statements about declining news standards at the network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Boyer, Peter J. |title=BILL MOYERS IS EXPECTED TO KEEP TIE TO CBS NEWS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/07/movies/bill-moyers-is-expected-to-keep-tie-to-cbs-news.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York, NY United States |date=November 7, 1986 |access-date=October 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and declined to renew his contract with CBS, citing commitments with PBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Boyer, Peter J. |title=MOYERS WILL SEVER CBS TIE |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/21/arts/moyers-will-sever-cbs-tie.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York, NY United States |date=November 21, 1986 |access-date=October 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Power of Myth'' series====
In 1986 Moyers and his wife, Judith Suzanne Davidson Moyers, formed ''Public Affairs Television''. Among their first productions was the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] 1988 documentary series ''[[The Power of Myth|Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth]]'', consisting of six one-hour interviews between Moyers and mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]]. The documentary covers Campbell's exploration of the [[monomyth]] and the [[hero cycle]], or the story of the hero, as it manifests itself in various cultures. Campbell's influence is clearly seen in the work of [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga. In the first interview, filmed at George Lucas' "[[Skywalker Ranch]]",&lt;ref name="herosadventure"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hero's Adventure|publisher=TV.com|url=http://www.tv.com/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth/the-heros-adventure/episode/432756/summary.html|accessdate=June 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moyers and Campbell discuss the relationship between Campbell's theories and Lucas's creative work. Twelve years after the making of ''The Power of Myth'', Moyers and Lucas met again for the 1999 interview, the ''Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas &amp; Bill Moyers'', to further discuss the impact of Campbell's work on Lucas's films.&lt;ref name="dvdlucas"&gt;{{cite book|title=DVD: The Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas and Bill Moyers|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7365-7936-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis''====
In 1987 Moyers produced and hosted a scathing documentary, ''The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis'', covering the infringement on the limitations on government and the executive branch provided by the Constitution. It considered U.S. foreign policy and militarism historically and recently, centering on the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. It was harshly rebuked by conservatives and continuing into the 1990s was used by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] as a reason to threaten the funding of the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] and PBS.

====''In Search of the Constitution''====
Also in 1987 Moyers produced an 11-part documentary celebrating the bicentennial of the signing of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and critically analyzing the present state of affairs and the intervening 200 years. Four episodes of ''In Search of the Constitution'' were interviews of sitting [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|justices]] and the remainder contained discussions with prominent scholars. The miniseries was produced by [[Madeline Amgott]].&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite news|first= |last=|title=Madeline Amgott Dead: Pioneering Female TV News Producer Dies at 92 |url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/people-news/madeline-amgott-dead-pioneering-female-tv-news-producer-dies-at-92-1201266910/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher= |date=July 22, 2014 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''A World of Ideas''====
In 1988, Moyers produced an interview series featuring writers, artists, philosophers, scientists, and historians he had become acquainted with. The series broke new ground for national television by bringing thoughtful, intelligent, provocative, and noteworthy people to the screen, most of whom had little prior exposure in the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/12/movies/reviews-television-bill-moyers-examines-public-issues.html|title=Reviews/Television -  Bill Moyers Examines Public Issues - NYTimes.com|date=September 12, 1988|publisher=|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was revived in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billmoyers.com/series/a-world-of-ideas/|title=A World of Ideas (1988, 1990)|work=BillMoyers.com|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moyers published companion books for both the first series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0385262787 | title = Bill Moyers' World of Ideas | last1 = Moyers | first1 = Bill | year = &lt;!--replace this comment with the publication year--&gt; | origyear = 1989 | publisher = Doubleday | location = New York  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0385416652 | title = A World of Ideas II | last1 = Moyers | first1 = Bill | year = &lt;!--replace this comment with the publication year--&gt; | origyear = 1990 | publisher = Main Street Books | location = New York  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NBC News====
Moyers briefly joined [[NBC News]] in 1995 as a senior analyst and commentator, and the following year he became the first host of sister cable network [[MSNBC]]'s ''Insight'' program. He was the last regular commentator on the ''[[NBC Nightly News]]''.&lt;ref name="opinionsdifferoncbs"/&gt;

====''NOW with Bill Moyers''====
Moyers hosted the TV news journal ''[[NOW with Bill Moyers]]'' on PBS for three years, starting in January 2002. He retired from the program on December 17, 2004, but returned to PBS soon after to host ''[[Wide Angle (PBS series)|Wide Angle]]'' in 2005. When he left ''NOW'', he announced that he wished to finish writing a biography of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].&lt;ref name="toleavepbs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Moyers to leave PBS|agency=AP|website=USA Today|date=February 19, 2004|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-02-19-bill-moyer_x.htm|accessdate=June 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Faith and Reason''====
In 2006, he presented two public television series. ''Faith and Reason'', a series of conversations with esteemed writers of various faiths and of no faith, explored the question "In a world in which religion is poison to some and salvation to others, how do we live together?"

====''Moyers on America''====
The series, ''Moyers on America'', analyzed in depth the ramifications of three important issues: the [[Jack Abramoff]] scandal, evangelical religion and environmentalism ([[Evangelical environmentalism]]), and threats to open public access of the Internet.

====''Bill Moyers Journal''====
On April 25, 2007, Moyers returned to PBS with ''[[Bill Moyers Journal]]''. In the first episode, "Buying the War", Moyers investigated what he called the general media's shortcomings in the runup to the [[Iraq War|War in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117933394.html?categoryid=32&amp;cs=1|title=Bill Moyers Journal: Buying the War|first=Brian|last=Lowry|date=April 20, 2007|accessdate=May 20, 2010|work=Variety|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509182725/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117933394.html?categoryid=32&amp;cs=1|archivedate=May 9, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==

===Regarding the U.S. media===

====On the media and class warfare====
In a 2003 interview with BuzzFlash.com,&lt;ref name="BuzzFlash"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Moyers is Insightful, Erudite, Impassioned, Brilliant and the Host of PBS' "NOW"|url=http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/03/10/int03281.html|work=interview|publisher=BuzzFlash.com|date=October 28, 2003|accessdate=December 18, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206125054/http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/03/10/int03281.html|archivedate=December 6, 2006|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Moyers said, "The corporate right and the political right declared class warfare on working people a quarter of a century ago and they've won." He noted, "The rich are getting richer, which arguably wouldn't matter if the rising tide lifted all boats." Instead, however, "[t]he inequality gap is the widest it's been since 1929; the middle class is besieged and the working poor are barely keeping their heads above water." He added that as "the corporate and governing elites are helping themselves to the spoils of victory," access to political power has become "who gets what and who pays for it."

Meanwhile, the public has failed to react because it is, in his words, "distracted by the media circus and news has been neutered or politicized for partisan purposes." In support of this, he referred to "the paradox of Rush Limbaugh, ensconced in a Palm Beach mansion massaging the resentments across the country of white-knuckled wage earners, who are barely making ends meet in no small part because of the corporate and ideological forces for whom Rush has been a hero. ... As Eric Alterman reports in his recent book—a book that I'm proud to have helped make happen—part of the red-meat strategy is to attack mainstream media relentlessly, knowing that if the press is effectively intimidated, either by the accusation of liberal bias or by a reporter's own mistaken belief in the charge's validity, the institutions that conservatives revere—corporate America, the military, organized religion, and their own ideological bastions of influence—will be able to escape scrutiny and increase their influence over American public life with relatively no challenge."&lt;ref name="BuzzFlash"/&gt;

====On media bias====
When he retired in December 2004, the AP News Service quoted Moyers as saying, "I'm going out telling the story that I think is the biggest story of our time: how the right-wing media has become a partisan propaganda arm of the [[Republican National Committee]]. We have an ideological press that's interested in the election of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and a mainstream press that's interested in the bottom line. Therefore, we don't have a vigilant, independent press whose interest is the American people."&lt;ref name="retire"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.commondreams.org/cgi-bin/print.cgi?file=/headlines04/1210-11.htm |title=Bill Moyers Retiring From TV Journalism |accessdate=July 25, 2007 |agency=Associated Press |year=2004 |author=Frazier Moore |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612003856/http://www.commondreams.org/cgi-bin/print.cgi?file=%2Fheadlines04%2F1210-11.htm |archivedate=June 12, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Karl Rove and U.S. politics===
;"The Progressive Story of America" speech
On June 4, 2003, Moyers gave a speech at the "Take Back America" conference. In it, Moyers defined what he considered  [[Karl Rove]]'s influence on [[George W. Bush]]'s administration. Moyers asserted that, from his reading of Rove, the mid-to-late 19th century was to Rove a "cherished period of American history." He further stated, "From his own public comments and my reading of the record, it is apparent that Karl Rove has modeled the Bush presidency on that of [[William McKinley]] ... and modeled himself on [[Mark Hanna]], the man who virtually manufactured McKinley",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdnF1xuMfAIC&amp;pg=PA17|title=Everyday politics: reconnecting citizens and the public life|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0610-11.htm|title=This is Your Story – The Progressive Story of America. Pass It On.|publisher=commondreams.org|accessdate=February 15, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121072914/http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0610-11.htm|archivedate=January 21, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scoop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0506/S00063.htm|title=Scoop: Bill Moyers Address: "Take Back America"|publisher=scoop.co.nz|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a man whose primary "passion" was attending to corporate and imperial power.

Furthermore, Moyers indicated that Hanna gathered support for McKinley's presidential campaign from "the corporate interests of the day" and was responsible for Ohio and Washington coming under the rule of "bankers, railroads and public utility corporations." He submitted that political opponents of this transfer of power were "smeared as disturbers of the peace, socialists, anarchists, or worse."&lt;ref name="harvard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scoop"/&gt;

Moyers also referred to what historian Clinton Rossiter called the period of "the great train robbery of American intellectual history," when "conservatives—or better, pro-corporate apologists" began using terms such as ''progress'', ''opportunity'', and ''individualism'' to make "...the plunder of America sound like divine right." He added that [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution was also used by conservative politicians, judges, and publicists to justify the idea of a "natural order of things" as well as "the notion that progress resulted from the elimination of the weak and the 'survival of the fittest.'"&lt;ref name="harvard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scoop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5244/is_200306/ai_n20785379/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718225214/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5244/is_200306/ai_n20785379/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 18, 2013|title=Moyers' accusation – ''The Washington Times''|publisher=findarticles.com|accessdate=February 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He concludes, "This 'degenerate and unlovely age', as one historian calls it, exists in the mind of Karl Rove, the reputed brain of George W. Bush, as the seminal age of inspiration for the politics and governance of America today."&lt;ref name="harvard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scoop"/&gt;

==Presidential draft initiative==
On July 24, 2006, liberal political commentator [[Molly Ivins]] published an article entitled ''Run Bill Moyers for President, Seriously'' on the progressive website [[Truthdig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/07/25/ivins.candidates/|title=Ivins: Reality-based candidate – Jul 25, 2006|publisher=CNN|accessdate=February 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ivinstruthdig"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ivins|first=Molly|title=Run Bill Moyers for President, Seriously|publisher=truthdig.com|date=July 24, 2006|url=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20060724_molly_ivins_bill_moyers/|accessdate=June 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/28/opinion/main1845088.shtml|title=Bill Moyers For President? Absolutely|publisher=cbsnews.com|accessdate=February 16, 2010|date=July 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in October 2006 [[Ralph Nader]] wrote an article supporting a Moyers candidacy.&lt;ref name="nadercommondreams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nader |first=Ralph |title=Bill Moyers For President |publisher=CommonDreams.org |date=October 28, 2006 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views06/1028-24.htm |accessdate=June 9, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613013458/http://www.commondreams.org/views06/1028-24.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no effect from the op-eds, and Moyers did not run.

==Allegations of bias==
[[George W. Bush administration|Bush-appointee]] [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] chairman [[Kenneth Tomlinson]] was a regular critic of Moyers; in 2003, he wrote to [[Pat Mitchell]], the president of PBS, that ''[[NOW with Bill Moyers]]'' "does not contain anything approaching the balance the law requires for public broadcasting."&lt;ref name="lehrer05"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/jan-june05/cpb_6-21.html |title= Public Broadcasting Under Fire |date=June 21, 2005 |work=[[NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]] |publisher= [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Tomlinson commissioned a study of the show, without informing or getting authorization from the CPB board.&lt;ref&gt;Labaton, Stephen (November 16, 2005). [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/16/politics/16broadcast.html "Ex-Chairman of Public Broadcasting Violated Laws, Inquiry Suggests"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113155138/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/16/politics/16broadcast.html |date=January 13, 2015 }}. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Tomlinson said that the study supported what he characterized as "the image of the left-wing bias of NOW".&lt;ref name="cpbbode"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bode |first=Ken A. |title=CPB Ombudsmen Reports: The Question Of "Balance"|date=September 1, 2005 |url= http://www.cpb.org/ombudsmen/display.php?id=6 |accessdate=June 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Neumayr]], the executive editor of ''[[The American Spectator]]'', a conservative magazine, told the ''[[NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'' that "PBS looks like a liberal monopoly to me, and Bill Moyers is Exhibit A of that very strident, left-wing bias... [Moyers] uses his show as a platform from which to attack conservatives and Republicans."&lt;ref name="lehrer05"/&gt;

Moyers, who left the show in 2004 before returning in 2007, replied by saying that his journalism showed "the actual experience of regular people is the missing link in a nation wired for everything but the truth." Moyers characterized Tomlinson as "an ally of Karl Rove and the right-wing monopoly's point man to keep tabs on public broadcasting." Tomlinson, he said, "found kindred spirits at the right-wing editorial board of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' where the '[[animal spirits (Keynes)|animal spirits]] of business' are routinely celebrated."&lt;ref name="cpbbode" /&gt; Moyers also responded to these accusations in a speech given to [[The National Conference for Media Reform]], saying that he had repeatedly invited Tomlinson to debate him on the subject but had repeatedly been ignored.&lt;ref name="speechtoncmr"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moyers|first=Bill|title=Bill Moyers' speech to the National Conference for Media Reform|publisher=FreePress.net|date=May 15, 2005|url=http://www.freepress.net/news/8120|accessdate=June 9, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704160613/http://www.freepress.net/news/8120|archivedate=July 4, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke about this again a few months later in a speech called "Democracy, Secrecy and Ideology" on the 20th anniversary of the [[National Security Archive]].&lt;ref name="speechnsa"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moyers|first=Bill|title=Bill Moyers' speech on the National Security Archive|date=December 9, 2005|url=http://billmoyers.com/2005/12/09/democracy-secrecy-and-ideology-december-9-2005/|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Bill Moyers 2018 (DIG14317-054).jpg|thumb|Moyers at the [[LBJ Presidential Library]] in 2018]]
Moyers married Judith Suzanne Davidson (a producer) on December 18, 1954. They have three children and five grandchildren. His son William Cope Moyers ([[CNN]] producer, [[Hazelden|Hazelden Foundation]] spokesman) struggled to overcome alcoholism and crack addiction as detailed in the book ''Broken: My Story of Addiction and Redemption''. He includes letters from Bill Moyers in his book, which he says are "a testament to a father's love for his son, a father's confusion with his son, and ultimately, a father's satisfaction with his son."&lt;ref name="cope"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazelden.org/web/public/ade60904.page|title=Moyers's memoir serves as a voice for recovery|accessdate=May 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other son, John Moyers, assisted in the foundation of [[TomPaine.com]], "an online public affairs journal of progressive analysis and commentary."&lt;ref name="john"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tompaine.com/about/|title=TomPaine.common sense: About Us|accessdate=July 15, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710130118/http://www.tompaine.com/about/|archivedate=July 10, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Character encoding''' is used to represent a repertoire of [[character (computing)|characters]] by some kind of [[code|encoding]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Definition from [http://techterms.com/definition/characterencoding The Tech Terms Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the [[abstraction level]] and context, corresponding [[code point]]s and the resulting code space may be regarded as [[bitstream|bit patterns]], [[octet (computing)|octets]], natural [[number]]s, electrical pulses, etc. A character encoding is used in [[computation]], [[computer data storage|data storage]], and transmission of textual [[data]]. "Character set", "character map", "codeset" and "[[code page]]" are related, but not identical, terms.

Early character codes associated with the optical or electrical [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] could only [[Representation (systemics)|represent]] a subset of the characters used in written languages, sometimes restricted to upper case letters, numerals and some punctuation only. The low cost of digital representation of data in modern computer systems allows more elaborate character codes (such as [[Unicode]]) which represent most of the characters used in many written languages. Character encoding using internationally accepted standards permits worldwide interchange of text in electronic form.

==History==
Early binary repertoires include [[Bacon's cipher]], [[Braille]], [[International maritime signal flags]], and the 4-digit encoding of Chinese characters for a [[Chinese telegraph code]] ([[Hans Schjellerup]], 1869). Common examples of character encoding systems include [[Morse code]], the [[Baudot code]], the American Standard Code for Information Interchange ([[ASCII]]) and [[Unicode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.smartbear.com/development/ancient-computer-character-code-tables-and-why-theyre-still-relevant/ | title=Ancient Computer Character Code Tables – and Why They're Still Relevant | publisher=Smartbear | date=17 April 2014 | accessdate=29 April 2014 | author=Tom Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morse code]] was introduced in the 1840s and is used to encode each letter of the [[Latin alphabet]], each [[Arabic numeral]], and some other characters via a series of long and short presses of a [[telegraph key]]. Representations of characters encoded using Morse code varied in length.

The [[Baudot code]], a five-bit encoding, was created by [[Émile Baudot]] in 1870, patented in 1874, modified by Donald Murray in 1901, and standardized by CCITT as International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) in 1930.

[[Fieldata]], a six-or seven-bit code, was introduced by the U.S. Army Signal Corps in the late 1950s.

[[IBM]]'s [[Binary-coded decimal#IBM and BCD|Binary Coded Decimal]] ([[BCD (character encoding)|BCD]]) was a six-bit encoding scheme used by IBM in as early as 1959 in its [[IBM 1401|1401]] and [[IBM 1620|1620]] computers, and in its [[IBM 700/7000 series|7000 Series]] (for example, 704, 7040, 709 and 7090 computers), as well as in associated peripherals. BCD extended existing simple four-bit numeric encoding to include alphabetic and special characters, mapping it easily to punch-card encoding which was already in widespread use. It was the precursor to EBCDIC.

[[ASCII]] was introduced in 1963 and is a seven-bit encoding scheme used to encode letters, numerals, symbols, and device [[control code]]s as fixed-length codes using [[integer]]s.

[[IBM]]'s [[EBCDIC|Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]] (usually abbreviated as EBCDIC) is an eight-bit encoding scheme developed in 1963.

The limitations of such sets soon became apparent,{{to whom|date=September 2018}} and a number of ''ad hoc'' methods were developed to extend them. The need to support more [[writing system]]s for different languages, including the [[CJK characters|CJK]] family of [[East Asian scripts]], required support for a far larger number of characters and demanded a systematic approach to character encoding rather than the previous ''ad hoc'' approaches.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} 

In trying to develop universally interchangeable character encodings, researchers in the 1980s faced the dilemma that on the one hand, it seemed necessary to add more bits to accommodate additional characters, but on the other hand, for the users of the relatively small character set of the Latin alphabet (who still constituted the majority of computer users), those additional bits were a colossal waste of then-scarce and expensive computing resources (as they would always be zeroed out for such users).

The compromise solution that was eventually found and developed into Unicode was to break the assumption (dating back to telegraph codes) that each character should always directly correspond to a particular sequence of bits. Instead, characters would first be mapped to a universal intermediate representation in the form of abstract numbers called [[code point]]s. Code points would then be represented in a variety of ways and with various default numbers of bits per character (code units) depending on context. To encode code points higher than the length of the code unit, such as above 256 for 8-bit units, the solution was to implement [[variable-width encoding]]s where an escape sequence would signal that subsequent bits should be parsed as a higher code point.

==Terminology==
[[File:KB Dubeolsik for Old Hangul (NG3).svg|thumb|365x365px]]
Terminology related to character encoding:
* A ''character'' is a minimal unit of text that has semantic value.
* A ''character set'' is a collection of characters that might be used by multiple languages. 
''Example:'' The Latin character set is used by English and most European languages, though the Greek character set is used only by the Greek language.
* A ''coded character set'' is a character set in which each character corresponds to a unique number.
* A ''code point'' of a coded character set is any allowed value in the character set.
* A ''code unit'' is a bit sequence used to encode each character of a repertoire within a given encoding form.

; Character repertoire (the abstract set of characters):

The character repertoire is an abstract set of more than one million characters found in a wide variety of scripts including ''Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hebrew, and Aramaic''.

Other symbols such as musical notation are also included in the character repertoire. Both the Unicode and [[GB18030]] standards have a character repertoire. As new characters are added to one standard, the other standard also adds those characters, to maintain parity.

The code unit size is equivalent to the bit measurement for the particular encoding:
* A code unit in [[US-ASCII]] consists of 7 bits;
* A code unit in [[UTF-8]], [[EBCDIC]] and GB18030 consists of 8 bits;
* A code unit in [[UTF-16]] consists of 16 bits;
* A code unit in [[UTF-32]] consists of 32 bits.

''Example of a code unit:'' Consider a ''[[String (computer science)|string]]'' of the letters "abc" followed by {{unichar|10400|DESERET CAPITAL LETTER LONG I}} (represented with 1 char32_t, 2 char16_t or 4 char8_t). That string contains:
* four characters;
* four code points
* either:
*: four code units in UTF-32 (00000061, 00000062, 00000063, 00010400)
*: five code units in UTF-16 (0061, 0062, 0063, d801, dc00), or
*: seven code units in UTF-8  (61, 62, 63, f0, 90, 90, 80).

To express a character in Unicode, the hexadecimal value is prefixed with the string 'U+'. The range of valid code points for the Unicode standard is U+0000 to U+10FFFF, inclusive, divided in 17 [[Plane (Unicode)|planes]], identified by the numbers 0 to 16. Characters in the range U+0000 to U+FFFF are in the plane 0, called the ''[[Plane (Unicode)#Basic Multilingual Plane|Basic Multilingual Plane]]'' (BMP). This plane contains most commonly-used characters. Characters in the range U+10000 to U+10FFFF in the other planes are called ''[[supplementary characters]]''.

The following table shows examples of code point values:

A code point is represented by a sequence of code units. The mapping is defined by the encoding. Thus, the number of code units required to represent a code point depends on the encoding:
* ''UTF-8:'' code points map to a sequence of one, two, three or four code units.
* ''UTF-16:'' code units are twice as long as 8-bit code units. Therefore, any code point with a scalar value less than U+10000 are encoded with a single code unit. Code points with a value U+10000 or higher require two code units each. These pairs of code units have a unique term in UTF-16: [[UTF-16#cite note-Unicode7Ch3s8-5|"Unicode surrogate pairs".]]
* ''UTF-32:'' the 32-bit code unit is large enough that every code point is represented as a single code unit.
* ''GB18030:'' multiple code units per code point are common, because of the small code units. Code points are mapped to one, two, or four code units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/text/terminology.html | title=The Java Tutorials - Terminology | publisher=Oracle | accessdate=25 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|CCS}}Unicode encoding model==
[[Unicode]] and its parallel standard, the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]], together constitute a modern, unified character encoding. Rather than mapping characters directly to octets ([[byte]]s), they separately define what characters are available, corresponding natural numbers ([[code point]]s), how those numbers are encoded as a series of fixed-size natural numbers (code units), and finally how those units are encoded as a stream of octets. The purpose of this decomposition is to establish a universal set of characters that can be encoded in a variety of ways.&lt;ref name=utr17&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr17/ |title=Unicode Technical Report #17: Unicode Character Encoding Model |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To describe this model correctly requires more precise terms than "character set" and "character encoding." The terms used in the modern model follow:&lt;ref name=utr17/&gt;

A '''character repertoire''' is the full set of abstract characters that a system supports. The repertoire may be closed, i.e. no additions are allowed without creating a new standard (as is the case with ASCII and most of the ISO-8859 series), or it may be open, allowing additions (as is the case with Unicode and to a limited extent the [[Windows code page]]s). The characters in a given repertoire reflect decisions that have been made about how to divide writing systems into basic information units. The basic variants of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Cyrillic]] alphabets can be broken down into letters, digits, punctuation, and a few ''special characters'' such as the space, which can all be arranged in simple linear sequences that are displayed in the same order they are read. But even with these alphabets, [[diacritic]]s pose a complication: they can be regarded either as part of a single character containing a letter and diacritic (known as a precomposed character), or as separate characters. The former allows a far simpler text handling system but the latter allows any letter/diacritic combination to be used in text. [[Typographic ligature|Ligatures]] pose similar problems. Other writing systems, such as Arabic and Hebrew, are represented with more complex character repertoires due to the need to accommodate things like bidirectional text and [[glyph]]s that are joined together in different ways for different situations.

A '''coded character set''' (CCS) is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that maps characters to ''[[code point]]s'' (each code point represents one character). For example, in a given repertoire, the capital letter "A" in the Latin alphabet might be represented by the code point 65, the character "B" to 66, and so on. Multiple coded character sets may share the same repertoire; for example [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] and IBM code pages 037 and 500 all cover the same repertoire but map them to different code points.

A '''character encoding form''' (CEF) is the mapping of code points to ''code units'' to facilitate storage in a system that represents numbers as bit sequences of fixed length (i.e. practically any computer system). For example, a system that stores numeric information in 16-bit units can only directly represent code points 0 to 65,535 in each unit, but larger code points (say, 65,536 to 1.4&amp;nbsp;million) could be represented by using multiple 16-bit units. This correspondence is defined by a CEF.

Next, a '''character encoding scheme''' (CES) is the mapping of code units to a sequence of octets to facilitate storage on an octet-based file system or transmission over an octet-based network. Simple character encoding schemes include [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16BE]], [[UTF-32BE]], [[UTF-16LE]] or [[UTF-32LE]]; compound character encoding schemes, such as [[UTF-16]], [[UTF-32]] and [[ISO/IEC 2022]], switch between several simple schemes by using [[byte order mark]]s or [[escape sequence]]s; compressing schemes try to minimise the number of bytes used per code unit (such as [[Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode|SCSU]], [[Binary Ordered Compression for Unicode|BOCU]], and [[Punycode]]).

Although [[UTF-32BE]] is a simpler CES, most systems working with Unicode use either [[UTF-8]], which is [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with fixed-width ASCII and maps Unicode code points to variable-width sequences of octets, or [[UTF-16BE]], which is [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with fixed-width UCS-2BE and maps Unicode code points to variable-width sequences of 16-bit words. See [[comparison of Unicode encodings]] for a detailed discussion.

Finally, there may be a '''higher level protocol''' which supplies additional information to select the particular variant of a [[Unicode]] character, particularly where there are regional variants that have been 'unified' in Unicode as the same character. An example is the [[XML]] attribute xml:lang.

The Unicode model uses the term '''character map''' for historical systems which directly assign a sequence of characters to a sequence of bytes, covering all of CCS, CEF and CES layers.&lt;ref name="utr17" /&gt;

== Character sets, character maps and code pages ==
Historically, the terms "character encoding", "character map", "character set" and "[[code page]]" were synonymous in [[computer science]], as the same standard would specify a repertoire of characters and how they were to be encoded into a stream of code units – usually with a single character per code unit. But now the terms have related but distinct meanings,&lt;ref name="SteeleMSDN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/shawnste/2005/03/15/whats-the-difference-between-an-encoding-code-page-character-set-and-unicode/|author=Shawn Steele|title=What's the difference between an Encoding, Code Page, Character Set and Unicode?|date=15 March 2005|website=MSDN}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to efforts by standards bodies to use precise terminology when writing about and unifying many different encoding systems.&lt;ref name=utr17/&gt; Regardless, the terms are still used interchangeably, with ''character set'' being nearly ubiquitous.

A "'''code page'''" usually means a [[byte oriented|byte-oriented]] encoding, but with regard to some suite of encodings (covering different scripts), where many characters share the same [[code point|codes]] in most or all those code pages. Well-known code page suites are "Windows" (based on Windows-1252) and "IBM"/"DOS" (based on [[code page 437]]), see [[Windows code page]] for details. Most, but not all, encodings referred to as code pages are single-byte encodings (but see [[Octet (computing)|octet]] on byte size.)

IBM's Character Data Representation Architecture (CDRA) designates with coded character set identifiers ([[CCSID]]s) and each of which is variously called a "charset", "character set", "code page", or "CHARMAP".&lt;ref name=utr17/&gt;

The term "code page" does not occur in Unix or Linux where "charmap" is preferred, usually in the larger context of locales.

Contrasted to [[#CCS|CCS above]], a "character encoding" is a map from abstract characters to [[code word]]s. A "character set" in [[HTTP]] (and [[MIME]]) parlance is the same as a character encoding (but not the same as CCS).

"[[legacy system|Legacy]] encoding" is a term sometimes used to characterize old character encodings, but with an ambiguity of sense. Most of its use is in the context of [[Unicode|Unicodification]], where it refers to encodings that fail to cover all Unicode code points, or, more generally, using a somewhat different character repertoire: several code points representing one Unicode character,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basistech.co.jp/knowledge-center/database/uc-trillium-2.ppt "Processing database information using Unicode, a case study"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617193918/http://www.basistech.co.jp/knowledge-center/database/uc-trillium-2.ppt |date=17 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or versa (see e.g. [[code page 437]]). Some sources refer to an encoding as ''legacy'' only because it preceded Unicode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=IWS-Chapter03#79e846db|publisher=[[SIL International]]|title=Character set encoding basics|work=Implementing Writing Systems: An introduction|first=Peter|last=Constable|date=13 June 2001|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Windows code pages are usually referred to as legacy, both because they antedate Unicode and because they are unable to represent all 2&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; possible Unicode code points.

== Character encoding translation ==
As a result of having many character encoding methods in use (and the need for backward compatibility with archived data), many computer programs have been developed to translate data between encoding schemes as a form of data [[transcoding]]. Some of these are cited below.

{{Hispanic and Latino Americans}}
'''Chonga''' is a Spanish-derived term used especially in [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]], often to indicate a working-class, sexualized, aggressive, and emotionally expressive young woman.

Chongas are also a distinct [[subculture]], believed to have developed in [[Miami]] in the late 20th century. Members are typically young, working-class Latina women. In South Florida the term is usually considered a pejorative, though some young women are proud to identify themselves as such. While feminist scholarship on chongas is limited, early work by [[gender studies]] scholar Jillian Hernandez has suggested that the chonga identity is an "emerging [[icon]]", and that it can be empowering for working-class women.

==Etymology and meaning==
The intended meaning of the term "chonga" varies depending on the context in which it is used. The most specific meaning of the term denotes a member of the chonga subculture—young, usually working class and Latina women—who dress and often act in a sexualized, brash, sometimes aggressive manner. The term also has three looser meanings: as a synonym for prostitute; to refer to a woman who acts "gangsta" or in a thug like manner; and among female friends, as a jovial way to greet each other, as an alternative to "girlfriend!"&lt;ref name="hern68"&gt;Hernandez 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"&gt;Lush 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the term to refer to young women is believed to have arisen in [[Miami]], and only became prominent in the early 21st century. The same word has long been used in Latin American countries such as [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]] to refer to a brothel; the modern US usage of the word may be related to this, or might have arisen independently among Floridian Cuban-Americans. 

"Chonga" has lexical similarities with several other Spanish terms, some of which have been in use for centuries.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt; These include: 
* ''[[Cholo|chola]]''  - used in the [[Southwestern United States]] for women of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] or [[Mexican American|Mexican-American]] descent, sometimes with the added meaning that they are a "homegirl" or someone from the streets.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;
* ''chula'' - which denotes a cute or sexy young woman.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;
* ''chusma'' - in the US, this term is often used to denote  an oversexualized and under-Americanized woman of [[Cuban people|Cuban]] descent. In Latin America, the term can merely refer to loud, working-class women, and can even refer to a rabble, some of whom might not be female.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chonga subculture==
According to the journalist Tamara Lush, Chonga subculture may have first appeared in [[Miami]] during the 1980s. Early chongas were usually Cuban teenagers whose parents had recently immigrated to the US. In the 1990s, chongas often wore white shorts with a colored thong underneath, basketball jerseys, and fake gold jewelry. Over the years the style evolved, with for instance tight jeans becoming more popular than shorts.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;

===Chonga characteristics===
21st-century chongas will often exhibit at least some of the following characteristics: 
*Cheap but sexy clothing, which often includes "Brazilian jeans"&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Pocketless [[Skinny jeans]] that usually have an accentuating effect on the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; and revealing tops, a preference for gelled hair, synthetic nails and gaudy jewelry, often including fake gold, bangles and earring hoops.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Chongas sometimes like to have their names written on the hoops.&lt;/ref&gt;   
*Sexual availability, often along with a preference to be surrounded by men.  
*Hostility to other young women, unless they are fellow members of the same chonga crew.  
*Loud, emotionally expressive and aggressive behavior.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez ''passim'', and esp. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all chongas live up to these stereotypes; for example, sometimes women whose conduct is the most overtly sexualized will in fact be among the least interested in actual heterosexual encounters—in some cases chonga behavior is perhaps best understood as a kind of bonding between female friends.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depictions in the media===
Until 2007, chongas have rarely appeared in the media, despite their high visibility in real life. One of the rare exceptions was the ''Cheerleaders'' (2000) set of art photographs by [[Luis Gispert]].&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 77-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisgispert.com/index.php#mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;s=16&amp;p=1&amp;a=0&amp;at=0 The cheerleader set of images on Gispert's web site]. Not all pics feature chonga-like lasses; for an iconic image discussed at length in Hernandez, see pic no. 15. See also pic nos. 3, 9, 16 &amp; 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In popular culture, the few exceptions include [[Bratz]] dolls which have a chonga-like appearance; the chonga-like characters Lydia and Melina in the television comedy [[MADtv]]; and the chonga-like character Tina in the movie ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Chongas became considerably more common in popular culture after the 2007 release of [[Chongalicious]], a YouTube [[viral video]]. Hernandez noted that the only depiction she's aware of that accurately showed chongas in their social context was the 2007 "Bratz girls" exhibition by the ''GisMo Collective'' (Jessica Gispert and Crystal Molinary).&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 68, 79-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cultural and gender studies===
According to a 2009 article by gender studies scholar Jillian Hernandez, feminist literature covering chongas remains sparse, even after their profile was raised by the ''Chongalicious'' video. Hernandez contrasts this with the extensive body of work on [[Chicana feminism]], which explores the ''chola'' and ''chusma'' phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez argues the chonga image has become iconic in Miami, and states that the aesthetic appeal of the chonga can be considerable, which in her opinion partly explains why the ''cheerleaders'' set of photographs was successful in launching Gispert's international career.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The portrayal of chongas in the media can, however, be problematic, sometimes even repressive, as powerful negative images contribute to Latinas internalizing pressure to conform which originates from the dominant Anglo-American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Guzmán  2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypical representations of chongas can play a role in the United States' wider [[culture wars#United States of America|culture wars]], adding to concerns about the sexuality of some Latina women being "out of control" with their perceived high rate of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Gutiérrez ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing earlier work by Isabel Molina Guzmán,&lt;ref&gt;''Disorderly Bodies and Discourses of Latinidad in the Elián González Story'', Isabel Molina Guzmán (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez relates this to the [[Elián González affair]], where the media portrayal of Marisleysis González as having the chonga-like characteristic of emotional excess contributed to the degradation of the  privileged, "model minority status" that [[Cuban Americans]] had previously enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her own research, Hernandez found that most people she questioned considered "chonga" a pejorative term. One respondent even went as far as to say the term sums up all the negative Latina stereotypes. A few asserted that while they know several chongas, they don't know any who self-identify as such. Sometimes Latina women will admit they went through a brief "chonga" phase in their early teens, but later came to view the style as uncool. Yet some chongas chose to retain the identity into their twenties. Hernandez also found that some young woman are proud to call themselves chongas. Several expressed pride in their sexual attractiveness. The creators of "Chongalicious", who are themselves middle class, found they had considerably more male attention while pretending to be chongas, one of them saying back in 2007 that "I think we would have boyfriends if we were real chongas."&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt; Hernandez suggests that the chonga sub culture is in several ways a positive thing, representing women who are not shamed into invisibility by their low-class status or ethnic identity. She anticipates a broadening and deepening of feminist scholarship on chongas, to uncover the ways in which the chonga identity can be helpful to young women exploring their "bodies and pleasures".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Hernandez notes that she is consciously echoing [[Michel Foucault]] in using the term "bodies and pleasures", as she sees it as a more empowering alternative to "sexuality".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez ''passim'', esp. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comedy music''' is [[music]] that is [[Comedy|comic]] or [[humor]]ous in nature, encompassing a wide variety of [[music genre]]s. Popular types of comedy music include [[parody music]], [[novelty song]]s, [[comedy rock]] and [[comedy hip hop]]. Some comedians, such as [[Bo Burnham]] and [[Tim Hawkins]], use songs in stand-up in addition to more traditional joke-telling methods, while others, such as [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] and [[Lil Dicky]], focus entirely on comedy music as their sole medium of humor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2883">In [[Freudian psychology]], a '''condensation''' ({{lang-de|Verdichtung}}) is when a single idea (an image, memory, or thought) or dream object stands for several associations and ideas.

==In dreams/symptoms/jokes==
[[Freud]] considered that "dreams are brief, meagre and laconic in comparison with the range and wealth of the dream-thoughts." Images and chains of association have their emotional charges [[Displacement (psychology)|displaced]] from the originating ideas to the receiving one, where they merge and "condense" together.&lt;ref&gt;J Childers ed., ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (New York 1995) p. 51-2&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example a dream figure may resemble A, wear B's clothes and act like C, but nevertheless we know somehow that they are 'really' D - rather as with the composite photographs of [[Francis Galton]].&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 205-6&lt;/ref&gt; While condensation could serve the purposes of the dream [[Censorship (psychoanalysis)|censorship]] by disguising thoughts, Freud considered condensation as primarily the preferred mode of functioning of the unconscious [[Superego, ego and id|Id]].&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures of Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud saw the same mechanism of condensation at work in [[Phantasy (psychology)|phantasies]] and neurotic symptoms,&lt;ref&gt;O Fenichel, ''Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in parapraxis and jokes: he often cited as an instance [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]]'s quip about the rich man treating him 'famillionairily'.&lt;ref&gt;P Gay, ''Reading Freud'' (Yale 1990) p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==In metaphor/metonymy==

In the 1950s the concept was used by linguist [[Roman Jakobson]] in his influential article on [[metaphor and metonymy]]. Comparing the linguistic evidence to Freud's account of the dream-work, Jakobson saw symbolism as relating to metaphor, condensation and displacement to metonymy.&lt;ref&gt;E Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Jakobson's work encouraged [[Jacques Lacan]] to say that the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] is structured like a language, though he himself linked condensation to metaphor, not metonymy.&lt;ref&gt;J Lacan, ''Ecrits'' (London 1997) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36818">'''Fan fiction''' or '''fanfiction''' (also abbreviated to '''fan fic''', '''fanfic''', '''fic''' or '''ff''') is [[fiction]] about characters or settings from an original work of fiction, created by [[Fan (person)|fans]] of that work rather than by its creator. Fans may maintain the creator's characters and settings or add their own. It is a popular form of [[fan labor]], particularly since the advent of the Internet.

Fan fiction is rarely commissioned or authorized by the original work's creator or publisher and is rarely professionally published. It may or may not [[Copyright infringement|infringe on the original author's copyright]], depending on the jurisdiction and on such questions as for whether or not it qualifies as "[[fair use]]" (see [[Legal issues with fan fiction]]). Attitudes of authors and copyright owners of original works to fan fiction have ranged from indifference to encouragement to rejection. Copyright owners have occasionally responded with legal action.

The term "fan fiction" came into use in the 20th century as [[copyright|copyright laws]] began to delineate between stories using established characters that were authorized by the copyright holder and those that were unauthorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reporter.rit.edu/views/fanfiction-legal-battle-creativity|title=Fanfiction: A Legal Battle of Creativity|date=2016-02-05|work=Reporter Magazine|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For earlier works with similar characteristics, see [[Sequel#Unofficial sequels|unofficial sequel]] or [[pastiche]].

Fan fiction is defined by being both related to its subject's [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] [[fictional universe]]  (often referred to as "canon") and simultaneously existing outside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fan-Fiction-TV-Viewers-Have-It-Their-Way-1518184 |title=Fan Fiction—TV Viewers Have It Their Way |author=Schulz, Nancy | date=2001-12-31| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most fan fiction writers assume that their work is read primarily by other fans, and therefore presume that their readers have knowledge of the canon universe (created by a professional writer) in which their works are based.

==Earlier meanings of the term==
The term "fan fiction" has been attested in print as early as 1939; in this earliest known citation, it is used in a disparaging way to refer to amateurish science fiction (as opposed to "pro fiction").&lt;ref name="bravenewwords"&gt;{{cite book | title = Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction | editor = Jeff Prucher | year = 2007 | publisher = Oxford University Press, Inc. | location = New York | page = 57 | isbn = 978-0-19-530567-8 | url = https://books.google.pl/books?id=iYzi8m8FbEsC&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also appears in the 1944 ''Fancyclopedia'', an encyclopedia of fandom [[jargon]]. It is defined there as "fiction about fans, or sometimes about pros, and occasionally bringing in some famous characters from [science fiction] stories". The book also mentions that the term is "[s]ometimes improperly used to mean fan science fiction, that is, ordinary fantasy published in a fan magazine".&lt;ref name="bravenewwords" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fancyclopedia1944"&gt;{{cite book | title = Fancyclopedia | author = "John Bristol" | year = 1944 | publisher = The Fantasy Foundation | url = http://fanac.org/Fannish_Reference_Works/Fancyclopedia/Fancyclopedia_I/f1.html#8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Spockanalia2.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Star Trek'' fanzine ''Spockanalia'' contained the first fan fiction in the modern sense of the term.]]
The modern phenomenon of fan fiction as an expression of fandom and fan interaction was popularized and defined via [[Star Trek fandom|''Star Trek'' fandom]] and their [[fanzine]]s published in the 1960s. The first ''[[Star Trek]]'' fanzine, ''Spockanalia'' (1967), contained some fan fiction; many others followed its example.&lt;ref name="verba2003"&gt;{{cite book | title=Boldly Writing: A Trekker Fan &amp; Zine History, 1967-1987 | author=Verba, Joan Marie | year=2003 | publisher=FTL Publications | location=Minnetonka MN | url=http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | isbn=0-9653575-4-6 | access-date=2017-04-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910042451/http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | archive-date=2016-09-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} These fanzines were produced via offset printing and [[mimeograph]]y, and mailed to other fans or sold at [[science fiction conventions]] for a small fee to help recoup costs. Unlike other aspects of fandom, women dominated fan fiction authoring; 83% of ''Star Trek'' fan fiction authors were female by 1970, and 90% by 1973.&lt;ref name = "Coppa in Hellekson and Busse"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Francesca  | last = Coppa  | editor-last = Hellekson  | editor-first = Karen  | editor2-last = Busse  | editor2-first = Kristina  | contribution = A Brief History of Media Fandom  | title = Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet  | year = 2006  | pages = 41–59  | place = Jefferson, North Carolina  | publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Company]]  | isbn = 978-0-7864-2640-9 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar states that fan fiction "fill[s] the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official source products offered on the television and movie screen."&lt;ref name="cbs2000"&gt;{{cite book | title=Science Fiction Culture | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | author=Bacon-Smith, Camille | pages=112–113 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCvIZpCSRA0C&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-8122-1530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fan fiction has become more popular and widespread since the advent of the World Wide Web; according to one estimate, fan fiction comprises one third of all content about books on the Web.&lt;ref name="boog20080918"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/brokeback-33-percent_b7743?c=rss |title=Brokeback 33 Percent |work=Mediabistro |date=September 18, 2008 |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |author=Boog, Jason |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210011535/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/brokeback-33-percent_b7743?c=rss |archive-date=2013-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to traditional fanzines and conventions, [[Usenet group]] [[electronic mailing lists]] were established for fan fiction as well as fan discussion. Online, searchable fan fiction archives were also established. The online archives were initially non-commercial hand-tended and fandom- or topic-specific. These archives were followed by non-commercial automated databases. In 1998, the not-for-profit site [[FanFiction.Net]] came online, which allowed anyone to upload content in any fandom.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{Cite news |last=Buechner |first=Maryanne Murray |title=Pop Fiction |date=March 4, 2002 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001950,00.html |accessdate=May 29, 2010 |newspaper=[[Time Magazine]] |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

One popular example of modern fan fiction is [[E. L. James]]' ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]''. This series was originally written as fan fiction for the ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' series of books and movies and played off the characters of Bella and Edward. In order to not infringe on copyright issues, James changed the character names to Anna and Christian for the purposes of her novels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/holy-crow-fifty-shades-grey-crazy-similar-its-twil-215185|title=Holy crow!

On May 22, 2013, the online retailer [[Amazon.com]] established a new publishing service, [[Kindle Worlds]]. This service would enable fan fiction stories of certain licensed media properties to be sold in the [[Kindle Store]] with terms including 35% of net sales for works of 10,000 words or more and 20% for short fiction ranging from 5000 to 10,000 words. However, this arrangement includes restrictions on content, copyright violations, poor document formatting and/or using misleading titles.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pepitone|first=Julianne|title=Amazon's "Kindle Worlds" lets fan fiction writers sell their stories|url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/23/technology/amazon-fan-fiction/?iid=HP_LN&amp;hpt=us_bn5|accessdate=23 May 2013|newspaper=CNN Money|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese dōjinshi===
A similar trend in [[Japanese literature|Japan]] also began appearing around the 1960s and 1970s, where [[Self-published|independently published]] [[manga]] and novels, known as ''[[dōjinshi]]'', are frequently published by [[dōjin]] circles; many of these dōjinshi are based on existing [[manga]], [[anime]], and [[video game]] franchises. [[Mangaka|Manga authors]] like [[Shotaro Ishinomori]] and [[Fujiko Fujio]] formed dōjin groups such as Fujio's {{nihongo|New Manga Party|新漫画党|Shin Manga-tō}}. At this time, dōjin groups were used by artists to make a professional debut. This changed in the coming decades with dōjin groups forming as school clubs and the like. This culminated in 1975 with the [[Comiket]] in Tokyo.

===Genres===
In addition to the "regular" [[list of genres]], which for fanfiction are usually determined by the work they're based on, there are a few genres that are closely associated with fanfic. Often, they also overlap. The genres include:

====Angst====
A story with an angsty mood centered on a character/characters who are brooding, sad, or in anguish.

====AU or alternate universe====
{{Main|Alternative universe (fan fiction)}}
Characters set in a universe other than their own canonical one.

====Crossover====
Works featuring characters, items, or setpieces from multiple fandoms.

====Darkfic====
Stories which are considerably grimmer and/or more depressing than the original, often in deliberate contrast to the canonical work(s). Not all stories tagged as "[[Darkness#Literature|dark]]" count as darkfic.  This is sometimes done with fandoms which are meant to be light-hearted or for children.

====Fix-fic====
A counterpart to darkfic, or perhaps its supergenre, fix-fic or more commonly known as "fix-it", refers to stories which rewrite canonical events that the author disliked, often because they were depressing or incomprehensible.

====Fluff or WAFF====
A story designed to be happy, and nothing else. The plot is usually less relevant in these types of works, as the main focus is to be cheerful. WAFF is short for "Warm And Fuzzy Feelings," and the two terms are quite similar in usage.

====Fusion====
Works blending two settings, and sometimes their casts, into a cohesive whole.

====Hurt/comfort====
A story in which a character is put through a traumatizing experience in order to be comforted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Fanspeak Dictionary|url=http://expressions.populli.net/dictionary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peggy Sue====
A story in which one of the characters is sent back in time, getting a second chance with knowledge of the original plot. Named after the movie ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'', in which this happens to the titular character. [[Groundhog Day (film)|''Groundhog Day'']] is an example of this happening repeatedly. Refers to both the story and the character in this situation. Not related to [[Mary Sue]].

====Rationalist rewrite====
Rebuild fiction that heavily features critical thinking skills and deductive reasoning. Also popularized by ''Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality''.

====Rebuild fiction====
A subtype of fix-fic, wherein aspects of the setting and/or characters are rewritten to be more cohesive. Named for the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' series, which originally qualified, and popularized by ''[[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]''.

====Self-insert====
A genre of fanfiction in which a version of the author is transported to, or discovers they are inside, the world the fanfiction is based on. Almost always [[first-person narration|written in the first person]]. Fanfictions of this type are often also fix-fics.

====Multicross self-insert====
Instead of a single fictional universe, the inserted author is taken to many in a row, and must usually solve some problem or complete some challenge in each place before moving on. Gaining new powers and occasionally companions from each world is common.

====Shipping====
A variant of [[list of genres#romance|romance]], focused on exploring a relationship between two or more characters from the original fandom(s). It has several subgenres, including Slash (which focuses on homosexual pairings, usually of the male variety), [[Femslash]]/Femmeslash/Yuri (same as Slash, but exclusively female/female), Crossover Shipping, which focuses on a romance between characters from multiple fandoms, and "friendshipping", which focuses on platonic relationships.

====Curtainfic====
A subcategory of shipping; describes romantic couples in mundane domestic situations such as picking out [[curtains]].

====Smut====
Smut is sexually explicit or pornographic writing. This could refer to a small portion of a story, or in its entirety.  The terms "lemon" and "lime" are often used to allude to the upcoming sexual scene.

====Songfic====
Songfic, also known as a song fic or a song-fic, is a genre of fan fiction that features a fictional work interspersed with the lyrics of a relevant song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yfOTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Critical Perspectives on Harry Potter|last=Heilman|first=Elizabeth E.|date=2008-09-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135891541|pages=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbcqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Media Convergence Handbook - Vol. 2: Firms and User Perspectives|last=Lugmayr|first=Artur|last2=Zotto|first2=Cinzia Dal|date=2016-07-23|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642544873|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a [[portmanteau]] of "song" and "fiction"; as such, one might also see the genre referred to as "songfiction". As many lyrics are under [[copyright]], whether songfics are a violation of that copyright law is a subject of debate. Some fan fiction websites, such as FanFiction.Net, have barred authors from posting songfics with lyrics outside the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/|title=Guidelines|website=FanFiction.net|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay in ''Music, Sound, and Silence in Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', [[University of Sydney]] professor [[Catherine Driscoll]] commented that the genre was "one of the least distinguished modes of fan production" and that "within fan fiction excessive attachment to or foregrounding of popular music is itself dismissed as immature and derivative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKxBuIcAoeEC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Music, Sound and Silence in Buffy the Vampire Slayer|last=Attinello|first=Paul Gregory|last2=Halfyard|first2=Janet K.|last3=Knights|first3=Vanessa|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9780754660415|pages=114, 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vent====
Vent refers to literature written by an author under duress or for therapeutic purposes, normally to calm themselves following a stressful or upsetting situation.

==Other related terms==

===A/N===
An abbreviation of "author's note".  Author's notes can be written at any point during a fanfiction (in some cases interrupting the flow of the piece by appearing within the body of a fanfiction), but are typically found directly before the beginning of a fanfiction or after it has concluded, and also at the starts or ends of chapters if the story is updated periodically. A/N's are used to convey direct messages from the author to the reader regarding the piece.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Canon===
Canon is the original story. This means anything related to the original source including the plot, settings, and character developments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/moonbeam/terms.html|title=Common Fandom Terms|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disclaimer ===
{{see also|Legal issues with fan fiction}}
[[Disclaimer]]s are author's notes typically informing readers about who deserves credit for the original source material,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://expressions.populli.net/dictionary.html|title=A Fanspeak Dictionary|last=Freeman|first=Morgan|date=|website=|access-date=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often containing pseudo-legal language disavowing any intent of [[copyright infringement]] or alluding to [[fair use]]. Such "disclaimers" are legally ineffective and based on misunderstandings of [[copyright law]], particularly confusion between illegal copyright infringement and unethical [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dearauthor.com/features/letters-of-opinion/fan-fiction-plagiarism-and-copyright/|title=Fan Fiction, Plagiarism, and Copyright|date=18 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fandom ===
A [[fandom]] is a group of fans of a particular work of fiction (e.g. novel, film, television show or video game). Members of a fandom are typically interested in even minor details of the plot/characters of their fandom and often spend a significant portion of their time and energy involved with their interest, that is why most fanfictions are written by members of a particular fandom(s).

===Fangirl/fanboy===
A female/male that is a part of one or more fandoms. Furthermore, the term fangirling/fanboying refers to a moment where a person "geeks out" or gets quite excited about a fandom.

===Fanon===
Fanon is an idea that is widely believed to be true among fans, but is unconfirmed, preventing it from being labelled as canon. Fanon may refer to a whole interpretation of the original work, or to specific details within it.

===Headcanon===
Headcanon is a fan's personal, idiosyncratic interpretation of canon, such as the backstory of a character, or the nature of relationships between characters. It may represent a teasing out of subtext present in the canon, or it may directly contradict canon. If many other fans share this interpretation, it may become fanon.

===Mary Sue===
Also of note is the concept of the "[[Mary Sue]]", a term credited as originating in ''[[Star Trek]]'' fan fiction that has crossed over to the mainstream, at least among editors and writers. In early ''Trek'' fan fiction, a common plot was that of a minor member of the USS ''Enterprise''{{'}}s crew saving the life of Captain Kirk or Mister Spock, often being rewarded with a sexual relationship as a result. The term "Mary Sue", originating in a parody of stories in this [[wish fulfillment]] genre, thus tends to refer to an idealized or fictional character lacking flaws, often representing the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Segall |year=2008 |title=Fan Fiction Writing: New Work Based on Favorite Fiction |publisher=Rosen Pub. |page=26 |isbn=1404213562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OTP===
An abbreviation of the term "one true pairing", where the author or reader ships (wishes for a romantic relationship between) certain characters from a fandom. Additionally, OTPs are also subsetted as OT3s, which reference the reader's one true bonding with three people; this number can be changed to refer to larger bondings.

===RPF===
An abbreviation of "real person fanfiction". Describes fanfiction-like works written about real people, usually celebrities, instead of fictional characters.

===SI===
An abbreviation of self-insert, usually referring to either a story in the eponymous genre or to the author avatar within one.

===TW===
An abbreviation of "[[trauma trigger|trigger warning]]". Trigger warnings are meant to warn people of content in fics that could be harmful or "triggering" to those who have dealt with situations such as abuse. Fan fiction is tagged using various TWs so that readers may prepare for or avoid certain content. Sometimes CW, an abbreviation of "content warning", is used instead of or in addition to a TW. Trigger warnings are usually inserted when the subject matter of a work deals with things issues like drug abuse, mental illness, abuse, or extreme violence.

==Interactivity in the online era==
Reviews can be given by both anonymous and registered users of most sites, and sites are often programmed to notify the author of new feedback, making them a common way for readers and authors online to communicate directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/secure/review.php?storyid=3058878&amp;chapter=1&amp;storytextid=9301416' |title=Fanfiction.Net Review Form |publisher=[[Fanfiction.net]] |accessdate=April 24, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is intended for a type of bond between the reader and the writer, as well as helping the author improve their writing skills through [[constructive criticism]], enabling their to produce a better work next time.&lt;ref name="Merlin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firefox.org/news/articles/650/11/Dr-Merlin039s-Guide-to-Fanfiction/Page11.html |title=Dr. Merlin's Guide to Fanfiction |author=Merlin, Missy |publisher=[[Firefox]] |date=September 13, 2007 |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523223635/http://firefox.org/news/articles/650/11/Dr-Merlin039s-Guide-to-Fanfiction/Page11.html |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |df= }}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, unmoderated review systems are abused to send [[Flaming (Internet)|flames]], [[spam (electronic)|spam]], or [[Internet troll|trolling]] messages. As a result, the author of the story can either disable or enable anonymous reviews, depending on their preference. Internet fan fiction gives young writers a wider audience for their literary efforts than ever before, resulting in improved literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Tosenberger, Catherine (2008) "Homosexuality at the Online Hogwarts: Harry Potter Slash Fanfiction" ''Children's Literature'' 36 pp. 185-207 {{doi|10.1353/chl.0.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
{{Main|Legal issues with fan fiction}}
Fan fiction is a [[derivative work]] under [[United States copyright law]].&lt;ref name="legal-derivativeWork"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoosh.org/issue25/lee1a.html#41 |title=What's "Derivative Work?" |work=A Brief Introduction to Copyright for Fanfiction Authors |author=Lee, A.T. |publisher=Woosh! |date=October 1998 |accessdate=April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that fan fiction does not fall under [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6673573.html Burns, Elizabeth, and Webbr, Carlie.

Batts, permanently prohibiting publication in the United States of a book by Ryan Cassidy, a Swedish writer whose protagonist is a 76-year-old version of [[Holden Caulfield]] of ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', may be seen as upholding this position regarding publishing fan fiction, as the judge stated, "To the extent Defendants contend that 60 Years and the character of Mr. C direct parodied comment or criticism at ''Catcher'' or Holden Caulfield, as opposed to Salinger himself, the Court finds such contentions to be post-hoc rationalizations employed through vague generalizations about the alleged naivety of the original, rather than reasonably perceivable parody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chan |first=Sewell |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/judge-rules-for-salinger-in-copyright-suit/?hp |title=Chan, Sewell.

Others such as the [[Organization for Transformative Works]] uphold the legality of non-profit fan fiction under the fair use doctrine, as it is a creative, [[Transformation (law)|transformative]] process.&lt;ref name="legal-fairUse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Legal |publisher=[[Organization for Transformative Works]] |url=http://transformativeworks.org/faq/legal |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001030602/http://transformativeworks.org/faq/legal |archivedate=October 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Lucasfilm]] Ltd. sent out a letter to several [[fanzine]] publishers, asserting Lucasfilm's copyright to all [[List of Star Wars characters|''Star Wars'' characters]] and insisting that no fanzine publish [[pornography]]. The letter also alluded to possible legal action that could be taken against fanzines that did not comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html |last=Jenkins |first=Henry |title=Quentin Tarantino's Star Wars?: Digital Cinema, Media Convergence, and Participatory Culture |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309235553/http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html |archivedate=March 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harry Potter Lexicon is one case where the encyclopedia-like website about everything in the Harry Potter series, moved towards publishing and commercializing the Lexicon as a supplementary and complementary source of information to the series. Rowling and her publishers levied a lawsuit against the website creator, Steven Vander Ark, and the publishing company, RDR Books, for a breach of copyright. While the lawsuit did conclude in Vander Ark's favor, the main issue in contention was the majority of the Lexicon copied a majority of the Series' material and does not transform enough of the material to be held separately from the series itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwabach|first=Aaron|title=The Harry Potter Lexicon and the World of Fandom: Fan Fiction, Outsider Works and, Copyright|journal=University of Pittsburgh Law Review|year=2009|volume=70|issue=3|pages=387–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the HP Lexicon case is an example of Western culture treatment of fan fiction and copyright law, in China, Harry Potter fan fiction is less addressed in legal conflicts but is used as a cultural and educational tool between Western and Chinese cultures. More specifically, while there are a number of "fake" Harry Potter books in China, most of these books are treated as addressing concepts and issues found in Chinese culture. This transformative usage of Harry Potter in fan fiction is mainly from the desire to enhance and express value to Chinese tradition and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gupta |first=Suman |title=Re-Reading Harry Potter 2nd Ed. |year=2009 |publisher=Basingstoke (UK); New York (US): Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent authors have given their blessings to fan fiction, notably [[J.K. Rowling]]. Rowling said she was "flattered" that people wanted to write their own stories based on her fictional characters.&lt;ref name="bcc-rowling"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3753001.stm |title=Rowling backs Potter fan fiction |author=Waters, Darren |publisher=BBC |date=May 27, 2004 |accessdate=April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Stephenie Meyer]] has put links on her website to fan fiction sites about her characters from the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stepheniemeyer.com/ts_fansites.html |title=Twilight Series Fansites |publisher=StephenieMeyer.com |accessdate=October 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006021434/http://stepheniemeyer.com/ts_fansites.html |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fifty Shades (novel series)|''Fifty Shades'' trilogy]] was developed from a ''Twilight'' fan fiction originally titled ''Master of the Universe'' and published episodically on fan-fiction websites under the pen name "Snowqueen's Icedragon". The piece featured characters named after Stephenie Meyer's characters in ''Twilight'', [[Edward Cullen]] and [[Bella Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=mediabistro.com|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine_b49124|title=The Lost History of ''Fifty Shades of Grey''|author=GalleyCat|access-date=2015-06-30|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140727045638/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine_b49124|archive-date=2014-07-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=mtv.com |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1685954/fifty-shades-of-grey-stephenie-meyer.jhtml |title=''Fifty Shades of Grey'': Stephenie Meyer Speaks Out |publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of changing views on the subject, author [[Orson Scott Card]] (best known for the ''[[Enders Game]]'' series) once stated on his website, "to write fiction using my characters is morally identical to moving into my house without invitation and throwing out my family." He changed his mind completely and since has assisted fan fiction contests, arguing to the ''Wall Street Journal'' that "Every piece of fan fiction is an ad for my book. What kind of idiot would I be to want that to disappear?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano |first=Aja |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_orson_scott_card_hates_fan_fiction_the_homosexual_agenda_partner/ |title=Orson Scott Card’s long history of homophobia |publisher=Salon.com |date=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Anne Rice]] has consistently and aggressively prevented fan fiction based on any of her fictional characters (mostly those from her famous ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' and its sequels in ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]''). She, along with [[Anne McCaffrey]] (whose stance has been changed by her son, Todd McCaffrey, since her death) and [[Raymond Feist]], have asked to have any fiction related to their series removed from FanFiction.Net.&lt;ref name="bcc-rowling"/&gt; [[George R.R. Martin]], who was selected by ''Time'' magazine as one of the "2011 Time 100" and is most famous for his epic fantasy series, ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', is also strongly opposed to fan fiction, believing it to be copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgerrmartin.com/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions - George R.

The '''final girl''' is a [[trope (literature)|trope]] in [[horror film]]s (particularly [[slasher film]]s). It refers to the last girl or woman alive to confront the killer, ostensibly the one left to tell the story. The final girl has been observed in many films, including ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', and ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]''.{{sfn|Rogers|2002|pp=118,120}} The term was coined{{sfn|Totaro|2002}} by [[Carol J. Clover]] in her book ''[[Men, Women, and Chainsaws|Men, Women, and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film]]'' (1992).{{sfn|Clover|1992|pp=260}} Clover suggested that in these films, the viewer began by sharing the perspective of the killer, but experienced a shift in identification to the final girl partway through the film. 

==Usage of the term==
The original meaning of "final girl", as described by Clover in 1992, is quite narrow. Clover studied [[slasher film]]s from the 1970s and 1980s (which is considered the [[golden era]] of the genre) and defined the final girl as a female who is the sole survivor of the group of people (usually youths) who are chased by a villain, and who gets a final confrontation with the villain (whether she kills him herself or she is saved at the last minute by someone else - i.e. a police officer), and who has such a 'privilege' because of her implied moral superiority (i.e. she is the only one who refuses sex, drugs and other such behaviors, unlike her other friends). 

However, the term "final girl" is often used, especially in recent years, in a much broader sense, applied also outside the slasher genre, and to females who are not morally pure, or even who survive together with other survivors, provided the other survivors are not the main focus of the struggle. The stereotypical virginal girl contrasted with her girlfriends' promiscuity is largely out of use today. Furthermore, slasher films have declined in popularity in recent decades, being replaced with [[science fiction]] horror in the 1990s, and [[supernatural horror]] in the 21st century. In fact, it has been argued that the most common female character trope of the 21st century horror is the Dysfunctional Mother female character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.claremont.edu/scripps_theses/958/|title=The Final Girl Grown Up: Representations of Women in Horror Films from 1978-2016|first=Cupp,|last=Lauren|date=April 28, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trope concept==
A common plot line in many horror films is one in which a series of victims is killed one-by-one by a killer amid increasing terror, culminating in a climax in which the last surviving member of the group, usually female, either vanquishes the killer or escapes. 

The final girl trope has evolved throughout the years, from early final girls most often being [[damsels in distress]], often saved by a strong male (such as a police officer or a heroic stranger), to more modern final girls who are more likely to survive due to their own abilities. [[Lila Crane]], from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', is an example of a female survivor (according to Clover's definition not a final girl due to lack of moral purity) who is saved by a male (also named [[Samuel Loomis|Sam Loomis]]) at the film's ending, and [[Laurie Strode]] from ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' is a final girl saved by someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x4fLaCLD11MC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq|title=Men, Women, and Chain Saws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film|last=Clover|first=Carol J.|date=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691006202|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On this basis, Tony Williams argues that, whilst [[List of horror films of the 1980s|1980s horror film]] heroines were more progressive than those of earlier decades, the gender change is done conservatively, and the final-girl convention cannot be regarded as a progressive one "without more thorough investigation".{{sfn|Williams|1996|pp=169&amp;ndash;170}} Furthermore, in many slashers, the final girl's victory is often ambiguous or only apparent. The fact that she is still alive at the end of the movie does not make her a victorious heroine. In many of these movies, the end is ambiguous, where the killer/entity is or might be still alive, leaving the viewers uncertain about the future of the final girl (a notable example is [[Jess (Black Christmas)|Jess Bradford in ''Black Christmas'']] (1974). Tony Williams also gives several examples of final girls in the heroines of the ''Friday the 13th'' series such as Chris Higgins from ''[[Friday the 13th Part III|Part III]]''. He notes that she does not conclude the film wholly victorious. Chris is [[catatonia|catatonic]] at the end of the film. Williams also observes that ''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'' does not have a final girl, despite Trish Jarvis surviving at the end. Williams also notes that final girls often survive, but in the sequel they are either killed or institutionalized. A notable example is [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]] who survives ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980) only to be killed in the beginning of ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'' (1981). Derek Soles argues that the tragic destiny of such final girls represents an expression of patriarchal society where capable, independent women must by be contained or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Essentials of Academic Writing'', by Derek Soles, pg 374.&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent films, this has started to change, with the final girl no longer being always doomed, a notable example being the ''[[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]'' series.

According to Clover, the final girl in many movies shares common characteristics: she is typically sexually unavailable or [[virgin]]al, and avoids the vices of the victims like [[illegal drug use]]. She sometimes has a [[unisex name]] such as Avery, Chris, or Sidney. Occasionally the final girl will have a shared history with the killer. The final girl is the "investigating consciousness" of the film, moving the narrative forward and, as such, she exhibits intelligence, curiosity, and vigilance. Another trope of slashers (particularly in the 1980s) is "death by sex", where sex scenes are shortly followed by violence, with the participants being murdered in gruesome ways.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08838159409364261&lt;/ref&gt; More recent horror movies challenge more of these tropes. [[Buffy Summers]] in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', in the words of Jes Battis, "subverts" the final girl trope of [[B-grade]] horror films.{{sfn|Battis|2005|pp=69}} Jason Middleton observes that although Buffy fulfills the monster-killing role of the final girl, she is the opposite of Clover's description of a final girl in many ways. Buffy is a cheerleader, a "beautiful blond" with a feminine first name, and "gets to have sex with boys and ''still'' kill the monster".{{sfn|Middleton|2007|pp=160&amp;ndash;161}} [[Sidney Prescott]] in  ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' also survives despite having sex.

One of the basic premises of Clover's theory is that audience identification is unstable and fluid across gender lines, particularly in the case of the slasher film. During the final girl's confrontation with the killer, Clover argues, she becomes masculinized through "phallic appropriation" by taking up a weapon, such as a knife or [[Chainsaws in popular culture|chainsaw]], against the killer. The phenomenon of the male audience having to identify with a young female character in an ostensibly male-oriented [[film genre|genre]], usually associated with sadistic [[voyeurism]], raises interesting questions about the nature of slasher films and their relationship with [[feminism]]. Clover argues that for a film to be successful, it is necessary for this surviving character to be female because she must experience abject terror, and many viewers would reject a film that showed abject terror on the part of a male. The terror has a purpose, in that the female, if she survives, is 'purged' of undesirable characteristics, such as relentless pursuit of personal pleasure. Certain films, like ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'' (2015), can be said to subvert traditional expectations of a final girl.

== Examples of final girls ==
=== Mari Collingwood ===
{{main|Mari Collingwood}}
While the 1972 version of the character has been viewed as more of a victim, the 2009 incarnation of the character has been observed to follow the "final girl" archetype. In ''Rape-Revenge Films: A Critical Study'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rape-Revenge Films: A Critical Study|last=Heller-Nicholas|first=Alexandra|publisher=McFarland|year=2011|isbn=9780786449613|location=|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandra Heller-Nicholas notes that that 2009 version of the character manifests traits of the trope, stating:
:"The most obvious shift towards a more generic horror structure, however, manifests in the "final girl" elements of Mari's character that are absent in the original. In 2009, Mari is not interested in drugs and argues it (although she finally succumbs). She fights back consistently throughout her attack; she deliberately lures Krug to her parents house as a way of possibly getting help; and Krug himself even observes at one point that she is a "cool customer." The film celebrates Mari's determination to survive, and the fact that this Mari lives and the 1972 one does not inadvertently acts as condemnation of the earlier version. The 2009 Mari was a fast swimmer and could get away (she was still shot, but only in the shoulder). But the 1972 Mari was physically unable to escape, and thus her "punishment" was death. Sara Paxton's Mari in the recent ''The Last House on the Left'' is not killed, and this presents the possibility that she herself was able to enact her own revenge, a dramatic act that would have significantly moved the film from being a rape revenge film where her parents act for her, to one where the raped woman seeks vengeance on her own behalf."
:"The depiction of Mari after Krug and his gang leave her (assuming she is dead) is a clear genre-marker, as she climbs out of the dark water at night to stumble home ''Creature from the Black Lagoon''-style. This depiction of her as a vacant monster continues throughout the rest of the film. Mari is not so much a rape survivor as she is the walking dead, whose only function is to provide her parents (specifically her father) with a motivation for violent and spectacular vengeance. Even in the scenes where John performs emergency surgery on their living room coffee table, Mari's face is mostly turned from the camera. It is less about ''her'' reaction and trauma than it is the ''impact'' her traumatized body has on her father."

=== Jess Bradford ===
{{main|Jess (Black Christmas)}}
An early example of a "final girl" can be found in the film ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974), where [[Jess (Black Christmas)|Jess Bradford]], played by [[Olivia Hussey]], is a well-developed character who refuses to back down against a series of more or less lethal male antagonists.&lt;ref name=Piepenburg&gt;{{cite news| last1= Piepenburg| first1= Erik| title=In Horror Films, the ‘Final Girl’ Is a Survivor to the Core| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/movies/in-horror-films-the-final-girl-is-a-survivor-to-the-core.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0|accessdate=24 October 2015|work=The New York Times|date= 22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jess is technically not a final girl according to the narrow definition, due to lack of chastity, but being a sole survivor of an early major influential slasher she is often analyzed together with final girls.

=== Sally Hardesty ===
{{Main|Sally Hardesty}}
[[Sally Hardesty]] from ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (1974), created by [[Tobe Hooper]] and portrayed by [[Marilyn Burns]], has been regarded as one of the earliest examples of the final girl trope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3315496/marilyn-burns-first-final/|title=Marilyn Burns: The First 'Final Girl' - Bloody Disgusting|website=bloody-disgusting.com|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laurie Strode ===
{{main|Laurie Strode}}
According to Clover, [[Laurie Strode]] (from ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'', ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]], [[Halloween: Resurrection|Halloween Resurrection]], and [[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween 2018)]]'' is another example of a final girl. Tony Williams notes that Clover's image of supposedly progressive final girls are never entirely victorious at the culmination of a film nor do they manage to eschew the male order of things as Clover argues. He holds up Strode as an example of this. She is rescued by a male character, Dr. [[Samuel Loomis]], in the ending of ''Halloween''.

=== Ellen Ripley ===
{{main|Ellen Ripley}}
Before the release of ''[[Alien 3]]'', Clover identified [[Ellen Ripley]] from the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]] as a final girl. Elizabeth Ezra continues this analysis for ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'', arguing that by definition both Ripley and Annalee Call must be final girls, and that Call is the "next generation of Clover's Final Girl". In Ezra's view, Call exhibits traits that fit Clover's definition of a final girl, namely that she is boyish, having a short masculine-style haircut, and that she is characterized by (in Clover's words) "smartness, gravity, competence in mechanical and other practical matters, and sexual reluctance" being a ship's mechanic who rejects the sexual advances made by male characters on the ship. However, Ezra notes that Call fits the description imperfectly as she is a [[gynoid]], not a human being.{{sfn|Ezra|2008|pp=73&amp;ndash;74}}

Christine Cornea disputes the idea that Ripley ''is'' a final girl, contrasting Clover's analysis of the character with that of [[Barbara Creed]], who presents Ripley as "the reassuring face of womanhood". Cornea does not accept either Clover's or Creed's views on Ripley. While she accepts Clover's general thesis of the final girl convention, she argues that Ripley does not follow the conventions of the slasher film, as ''Alien'' follows the different conventions of the [[science fiction film]] genre. In particular, there is not the foregrounding in ''Alien'', as there is in the slasher film genre, of the character's sexual purity and abstinence relative to the other characters (who would be, in accordance with the final girl convention, killed by the film's monster "because" of this). The science fiction genre that ''Alien'' inhabits, according to Cornea, simply lacks this kind of sexual theme in the first place, as it has no place in such "traditional" science fiction formats.{{sfn|Cornea|2007|pp=150&amp;ndash;151}}

=== Ginny Field ===
{{main|Ginny (Friday the 13th)}}
The character [[Ginny (Friday the 13th)|Ginny Field]] (from ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'') has often been viewed as an example of the trope. In ''The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film'', [[Barry Keith Grant]] stated that, "Ginny temporarily adopts Mrs. Voorhees's authoritarian role to survive. Although circumstances necessitate this, she clearly uses her enemy's strategy to become a phallic mother herself. This posture really questions the positive image of the Final Girl." He then called her "not victorious" when she called out for her boyfriend at the end of the film saying that it was done in a "non-independent manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film|last=Grant|first=Barry|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2015|isbn=0292772459|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Kenneth Muir references Ginny in ''Horror Films of the 1980s, Volume 1'', saying "Amy Steel is introduced as Ginny, our final girl and heroine, and the only person who seems to have an inkling of the nearby danger. She's more resourceful than Alice and nearly upstages even Laurie Strode during the film's tense finale, wherein she brazenly dresses up as Jason's dead mother and starts barking orders at the confused serial killer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horror Films of the 1980s, Volume 1|last=Muir|first=John|publisher=MacFarland|year=2012|isbn=0786455012|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Blood Money: A History of the First Teen Slasher Film Cycle'', Richard Nowell said "The shift in characterization of the female leads was also trumpeted during Ginny's self-confident entrance (Amy Steel) in ''Friday the 13th Part II''. Where the makers of its predecessor introduced Alice as she prepared cabins while dressed in denim jeans and a shapeless lumberjack shirt, the sequel's conventionally attractive lead is established immediately as combining masculine traits with feminine attributes. Ginny exits a battered VW bug in a flowing fuchsia skirt and a low-cut t-shirt."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blood Money: A History of the First Teen Slasher Film Cycle|last=Nowell|first=Richard|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=2010|isbn=1441188509|location=|pages=210|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginny's adoption of the monster's own strategy, in ''Part II'', brings into question whether the final girl image is in fact a wholly positive one.{{sfn|Williams|1996|pp=169&amp;ndash;170}}

===Sarah Connor===
{{main|Sarah Connor (Terminator)}}
Sarah Connor was a timid young woman for the most part in the first film, ''[[The Terminator]]''. She learned of the Terminator from Kyle Reese, and that he had come for her. By the end of the film, when it was down to her versus the Terminator, she had become a tough-as-nails heroine, and defeated the Terminator by luring it into a hydraulic press, where she crushed it. By the second film, she had become a hardened warrior, in danger of losing her humanity.

=== Nancy Thompson ===
{{main|Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)}}
The character [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]] (from ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]''),  has often been regarded as one of the most influential horror movie heroines. In his book ''Horror films of the 1980s'', John Kenneth Muir&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horror Films of the 1980s, Volume 1|last=Muir|first=John|publisher=McFarland|year=2012|isbn=0-78645-501-2|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; references Nancy Thompson, stating the following:

:"As written by Craven and performed by Heather Langenkamp, Nancy is a rarity in the horror genre: an intelligent and insightful youth who is capable of connecting the important things in her life. Only Nancy can recognize the link between worlds for what it is, and look below the surface of reality because she is already trained to do so, through family history. Nancy is prepared in her battle with Freddy because, one senses, she has already detected the dark truth lurking beneath the affluent surface of Elm Street. She has suffered her parent's divorce, her father's absence, and her mother's alcoholism...Nancy is even compared explicitly to Hamlet...in that Hamlet stamps out the lies of his mother, an act which Nancy will repeat during the course of the film..."

:"So the key to defeating her Freddy...is something that goes against Nancy's most prominent characteristic. She must turn her back on the dream demon. She must take back all the energy she gave him...This is Nancy's crisis: knowing when to dig for truth and confront the lies, and when to turn her back on the corruption and lies she has discovered..."

:"The final girl must actively take steps to protect herself and vanquish evil. For example, Nancy buys a survivalist, self-defense manual and in the conclusion of ''Elm Street'', baits Freddy into chasing her. She then runs him through a punishing course of booby traps...Unlike Laurie, whom ''Halloween'' depicts as a victim of unchangeable 'fate,' someone who must mount a defense on the fly, Nancy is armed for battle and ready to rock."

=== Sidney Prescott ===
{{main|Sidney Prescott}}
Kearney points to the character of [[Sidney Prescott]] in the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' franchise. One of the final girl stereotypes was that the final girl is supposed to be a virgin, but the ''Scream'' films challenged that by allowing Prescott to survive until the end – even after having sex.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1575">'''Fluorine absorption dating''' is a method used to [[Chronological dating|determine the amount of time]] an object has been underground.

Fluorine absorption dating can be carried out based on the fact that [[groundwater]] contains fluoride ions. Items such as [[bone]] that are in the soil will [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] fluoride from the groundwater over time. From the amount of absorbed fluoride in the item, the time that the item has been in the soil can be estimated.

Many instances of this dating method compare the amount of  fluorine and uranium in the bones to [[nitrogen dating]] to create more accurate estimation of date. Older bones have more fluorine and uranium and less nitrogen. But because [[decomposition]] happens at different speeds in different places, it's not possible to compare bones from different sites.

As not all objects absorb fluorine at the same rate, this also undermines the accuracy of such a dating technique. Although this can be compensated for by accommodating for the rate of absorption in calculations, such an accommodation tends to have a rather large [[margin of error]].

In 1953 this test was used to easily identify that the '[[Piltdown Man]]' was forged, almost 50 years after it was originally 'unearthed'.

"'''Free Hat'''" is episode 88 of the [[Animated cartoon|animated series]] ''[[South Park]]''. It originally aired on July 10, 2002. 

In the episode, the boys find out that their favorite movies are being enhanced, re-released and ruined in the process. In response, they form a club to "Save Films from their Directors." Their goal is to stop certain famous authors from wrecking any more of their original masterpieces. They also cater to a group who demand a trailer-trash toddler murderer be freed.

Much of the plot parodies ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]].'' The episode ridicules [[Lucasfilm]]'s digital altering of [[George Lucas]]' original [[list of changes in Star Wars re-releases|''Star Wars'' trilogy]] and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial#20th anniversary version|E.T.]]''. The episode also criticizes [[remake]] movies. 

The episode was written by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and is rated [[TV-MA]] in the United States.

== Plot ==
[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] get angry about Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' habit of altering their films with each "[[Reissue#Films|re-re-re-release]]" to make them more [[family-friendliness|family-friendly]] or [[political correctness|politically correct]].  They decide to form an organization to protect classic movies from changes. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] writes "Free Hat" on the advertising poster in the belief that freebies are necessary to attract people.  However, the crowd mistakenly thinks the rally is to free Hat McCullough, a convicted [[Infanticide|baby killer]] they believe is innocent. 

The crowd focuses on persuading the governor to free Hat, while the boys appear on ''[[Nightline]]'' to explain their group's motives. [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]] appear on the show, and when the boys mention changing ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', the two directors quickly decide this is a great idea. Determined to stop them, the boys sneak into Lucas' house and steal the master print for the film, but are caught by him.  Lucas calls the police, and the boys attempt to convince him to turn away Spielberg. As their attempts begin to sway him, Spielberg arrives flanked by guards and Lucas relents and gives Spielberg the film. The boys are taken prisoner to be guests at the film's premiere, but Tweek escapes. At the premiere is a trailer for a remastered version of ''South Park''{{'}}s [[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe|pilot episode]].

Back at the club, Tweek alerts everybody else to the situation at hand, but the crowd remains obsessed with Hat McCullough.  Meanwhile, Spielberg and Lucas, now joined by [[Francis Ford Coppola]], start making their way to the premiere in a convoy with the film's print enclosed in an ark being carried. Tweek ambushes the convoy wielding a [[bazooka]] and threatens to blow it up unless the boys are released. The negotiation ends when Spielberg invites Tweek to "blow it back to God," but reminds him all his life has been in pursuit of seeing a great film, and thanks to the new "effects beyond your wildest dreams" he wants to see it screened just as much as Spielberg does. Tweek pauses and is captured as he hesitates. At the premiere, Spielberg reveals his plan to destroy the original film afterwards, and the film begins. Knowing it will be horrible the boys look away while the audience watches. Parodying the climax of the actual [[Raiders of the Lost Ark]], the altered version kills the audience. Coppola's head shrivels up, Lucas' face is melted off his skull and Spielberg's head explodes. When there is finally silence, the kids find themselves tie-free and open their eyes. Cartman observes, "That new version must've sucked balls." 

Back in South Park, the boys think that they are going to be congratulated for stopping Spielberg and Lucas. However, the boys are congratulated for getting Hat released from prison instead. Despite the fact that Hat is obviously deranged and asks for a baby, the crowd cheers for him and presents him with one.  As the baby tries desperately to escape Hat, Tweek looks at the now offscreen Hat and shouts, "Oh, God!," implying that Hat killed the baby. The boys say that what they did might not matter now, but will matter later. When Tweek asks what if someone else tries to change the movie, Stan answers that it is "somewhere safe. Somewhere where...nobody will ever find it." The episode ends, referencing ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', with a shot of an old man placing the original prints inside a box, which he then places inside a warehouse labeled "[[Financial assistance following the September 11 attacks#American Red Cross|Red Cross 9/11 Relief Funds]]."

==Production==
In the DVD commentary, the creators say that they think of classic films as art, and that art shouldn't be changed to be politically correct. Stone comes out as "officially over Star Wars." Steven Spielberg wrote to Parker and Stone, saying he felt like he had "finally arrived now that he's one of the villains of South Park." Parker said that if he had anything to do with Spielberg not editing ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', he was "just as proud of that as wearing a dress to the [[72nd Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date = November 2005|title=South Park: The Complete Sixth Season: "Free Hat" ''(Audio commentary)'' |medium= DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home release==
"Free Hat," along with the sixteen other episodes from ''South Park'''s sixth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on October 11, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. IGN gave the season a rating of 9/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=South Park: The Complete Sixth Season DVD Review |publisher=IGN |date=February 26, 2009 |last=Schorn |first=Peter |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/10/14/south-park-the-complete-sixth-season |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Buchanan''' ({{lang-gd|Seòras Bochanan}}; February 1506 – 28 September 1582) was a Scottish historian and [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholar.  According to historian Keith Brown, Buchanan was "the most profound intellectual sixteenth century Scotland produced."   His ideology of resistance to royal usurpation gained widespread acceptance during the [[Scottish Reformation]]. Brown says the ease with which [[James II of England|King James VII]] was deposed in 1689 shows the power of Buchananite ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Keith M Brown, "Reformation to Union, 1560–1707," in R.A. Houston and W. W.  J.  Knox, eds., ''The New Penguin History of Scotland'' (2001) pp 182–275, quote at p 185&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Early upbringing and education in Paris===
His father, a Highlander&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macmillan|first=D.|title=George Buchanan, A Biography|year=1906|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a younger son of an old family, owned the farm of Moss, in the parish of [[Killearn]], Stirlingshire, but he died young, leaving his widow, five sons, and three daughters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macmillan|first=D.|title=George Buchanan, A Biography|year=1906|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in poverty. George's mother, Agnes Heriot, was of the family of the Heriots of Trabroun, [[East Lothian]], of which [[George Heriot]], founder of [[Heriot's Hospital]], was also a member. Buchanan, a native speaker of [[Scottish Gaelic]], is said to have attended Killearn school, but not much is known of his early education. His brother, Patrick Buchanan, was also a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macmillan|first=D.|title=George Buchanan, A Biography|year=1906|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1520 he was sent by his uncle, James Heriot, to the [[University of Paris]], where he first came in contact with the two great influences of the age, [[the Renaissance]] and the Reformation.  There, according to him, he devoted himself to the writing of verses "partly by liking, partly by compulsion (that being then the one task prescribed to youth)".

===Return to Scotland===
In 1522 his uncle died, and George Buchanan, who was at that time severely ill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macmillan|first=D.|title=George Buchanan, A Biography|year=1906|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; was unable to stay in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and returned to Scotland. After recovering from his illness, he joined the French auxiliaries who had been brought over to Scotland by [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany]], and took part in an unsuccessful siege of [[Wark on Tweed|Wark Castle]] on the border with England in late 1523.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Buchanan, George (1506-1582)|display=Buchanan, George (1506–1582)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year he entered the [[University of St Andrews]], where he graduated B.A. in 1525. He had gone there mainly to attend the lectures of [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]] on [[logic]]; and when Mair moved to Paris, Buchanan followed him in 1526.

===Professor and Procurator===
In 1528 Buchanan graduated M.A. at [[Scots College (Paris)|Scots College]], [[University of Paris]]. The next year he was appointed [[regent]], or professor, in the [[College of Sainte-Barbe]], and taught there for over three years. Sainte-Barbe was one of the most prestigious and advanced colleges at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macmillan|first=D.|title=George Buchanan, A Biography|year=1906|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; George added to that prestige by creating new reforms in teaching Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macmillan|first=D.|title=George Buchanan, A Biography|year=1906|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1529 he was elected "Procurator of the German [[Nation (university)|Nation]]" in the University of Paris, and was re-elected four times in four successive months. He resigned his regentship in 1531, and in 1532 became tutor to [[Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd Earl of Cassilis]], with whom he returned to Scotland early in 1537 having acquired a great reputation for learning.

===Theological stance===
At this period Buchanan assumed the same attitude toward the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as [[Erasmus]]: he did not repudiate its doctrines, but considered himself free to criticise its practice. Though he listened to the arguments of the [[Protestant Reformers]], he did not join their ranks until 1553. His first literary production in Scotland, when he was in Lord Cassilis's household in the west country, was the poem ''Somnium'', a [[satirical]] attack on the [[Franciscan friars]] and the [[monastic life]] generally. This assault on the monks was not displeasing to [[James V of Scotland|James V]], who engaged Buchanan as tutor to one of his natural sons, Lord James Stewart (not the son who was afterwards regent), and encouraged him in a more daring effort. The poems ''Palinodia'' and ''Franciscanus et Fratres'' remained unpublished for many years, but made the author hated by the Franciscan order.

==Humanist in exile==

===Arrest, escape and relocation===
In 1539 there was persecution in Scotland of the [[Lutheran]]s, and Buchanan among others was arrested. Although the King had withheld his protection, Buchanan managed to escape and made his way to London, and then Paris. In Paris, however, he found himself in danger when his main enemy, Cardinal [[David Beaton]], arrived there as ambassador, and on the invitation of [[André de Gouveia]], he moved to [[Bordeaux]]. Gouveia was then principal of the newly founded [[College of Guienne]], and by his influence Buchanan was appointed professor of [[Latin]]. During his time there several of his major works, the translations of ''[[Medea]]'' and ''[[Alcestis]]'', and the two dramas, ''Jephthes (sive Votum)'' and ''Baptistes (sive Calumnia)'', were completed.
[[File:George Buchanan by Jacobus Houbraken.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Buchanan, original engraving by [[Jacobus Houbraken]]]]
[[Michel de Montaigne]] was Buchanan's pupil at Bordeaux&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montaigne|first=Michel|editor=Emmanuel Naya|others=Delphine Reguig-Naya, Alexandre Tarrête|title=Essais I|edition=Folio|publisher=Gallimard|isbn=978-2-07-042381-1|page=642}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acted in his [[tragedies]]. In the essay ''Of Presumption'' he classes Buchanan with Jean d'Aurat, [[Theodore Beza]], [[Michel de l'Hôpital]], Pierre de{{nbsp}}Montdoré and [[Adrianus Turnebus]], as one of the foremost Latin poets of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montaigne|first=Michel|editor=Emmanuel Naya|others=Delphine Reguig-Naya, Alexandre Tarrête|title=Essais II|edition=Folio|publisher=Gallimard|isbn=978-2-07-042382-8|page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here also Buchanan formed a lasting friendship with [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]]; in later life he won the admiration of [[Joseph Scaliger]], who wrote an [[epigram]] on Buchanan which contains the [[couplet]], famous in its day: "Imperii fuerat Romani Scotia limes; Romani eloquii Scotia limes erit?" Austin Seal and Steve Philp translate this as: 'Just as Scotland was at the apex of the Roman Empire, so Scotland shall be at the apex of Roman eloquence'. (Not only is Buchanan's Latin scholarship extolled, a congratulatory reference to Scotland retaining Scottish law – quintessentially an improved version of Roman law – as the foundation of its legal system is also implied.)

===Return to Paris===
In 1542 or 1543 he returned to Paris, and in 1544 he was appointed regent in the Collège du cardinal Lemoine. Among his colleagues were [[Muretus]] and Turnebus. Although little is known about George during this time, we can gather that he probably once again fell ill according to an elegy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macmillan|first=D.|title=George Buchanan, A Biography|year=1906|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote to his comrades Tastaeus and Tevius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Irving|first=David|authorlink=David Irving (librarian)|title=Memoirs of the Life and Writings of George Buchanan|year=1807|publisher=Bell and Bradfute and A. Lawrie, and Longman, Hurst, and Rees, and Orme|location=London|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coimbra===
In 1547 Buchanan joined the band of French and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] humanists who had been invited by Gouveia to lecture in the Portuguese [[University of Coimbra]]. The French mathematician [[Elie Vinet]], and the Portuguese historian, [[Jerónimo Osório]], were among his colleagues; Gouveia, called by Montaigne ''le plus grand principal de France'', was rector of the university, which had reached the summit of its prosperity under the patronage of [[John III of Portugal|King John III]]. But the rectorship had been coveted by [[Diogo de Gouveia]], uncle of André and formerly head of Sainte-Barbe. It is probable that before André's death at the end of 1547 Diogo had urged the [[Inquisition]] to investigate him and his staff; up to 1906, when the records of the trial were first published in full, Buchanan's biographers generally attributed the attack to the influence of Cardinal Beaton, the [[Franciscan]]s, or the [[Jesuit]]s, and the whole history of Buchanan's residence in Portugal was extremely obscure.

===Trial and imprisonment===
[[File:Illustratedcatal00anna orig 0262v2.png|thumb|right|upright=0.75|George Buchanan, painter unknown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Annan|first1=Thomas|title=Illustrated catalogue of the exhibition of portraits on loan in the new galleries of art, Corporation buildings, Sauchiehall Street|date=1868|publisher=Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum|location=Glasgow|page=105|url=https://archive.org/stream/illustratedcatal00anna#page/104/mode/2up/|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A commission of inquiry was appointed in October 1549 and reported in June 1550. Buchanan and two Portuguese, [[Diogo de Teive (humanist)|Diogo de Teive]] and João da Costa (who had succeeded to the rectorship), were committed for trial. Teive and Costa were found guilty of various offences against public order, and the evidence shows that there was ample reason for a judicial inquiry. Buchanan was accused of Lutheran and [[Judaistic]] practices. He defended himself, admitting that some of the charges were true. About June 1551 he was sentenced to [[abjure]] his errors, and to be imprisoned in the monastery of [[São Bento Palace|São Bento]] in Lisbon. Here he listened to edifying discourses from the monks, whom he found "not unkind but ignorant".  In his leisure he began to translate the ''[[Psalms]]'' into Latin verse, completing the greater part of the work.

===Release===
After seven months, Buchanan was released on condition that he remain in Lisbon; and on 28 February 1552 this restriction was lifted. Buchanan then sailed for England, but soon made his way to Paris, where in 1553 he was appointed regent in the College of Boncourt. He remained in that post for two years, and then accepted the office of tutor to the son of the [[Charles de Cossé, Count of Brissac|Maréchal de Brissac]]. It was almost certainly during this last stay in France, where [[Protestantism]] was being repressed under King Henry II and his son Francis II, that Buchanan took the side of [[Calvinism]].

==Return to Scotland==

===Espousal of Protestantism===
In 1560 or 1561 Buchanan returned to Scotland, and by April 1562 was installed as tutor to the young [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], who read [[Livy]] with him daily. Although he had remained Catholic throughout his support of the new learning and his strident criticism of the vices of the clergy, he now openly joined the Protestants [[Covenanter|Reformed Church]] and in 1566 was appointed principal of [[St Leonard's College (University of St Andrews)|St Leonard's College]], [[St Andrews]], by the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Earl of Moray]]. Two years before, he had received from the queen the gift of the revenues of [[Crossraguel Abbey]]. Though a [[layman]], he was made [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Moderator of the General Assembly]] of the [[Church of Scotland]] in 1567. He had sat in the assemblies from 1563. He was the last [[lay person]] to be elected Moderator until [[Alison Elliot]] in 2004, the first female Moderator.

===Tutor and other offices===
Buchanan accompanied the Regent Moray to England, and his famous ''Detectio Mariæ Reginæ''—a scathing exposure of the Queen's relations to [[Henry Darnley|Darnley]] and the circumstances leading up to his death, published London: John Day, [1571]—was produced to the commissioners at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]].

In 1570, after the assassination of Moray, he was appointed one of the [[preceptor]]s of the young king, and it was through his strict [[tuition]] that [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] acquired his scholarship. As the young king's senior tutor, Buchanan subjected James to regular beatings but also instilled in him a lifelong passion for literature and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Croft, Pauline (2003). King James. Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan, p.{{nbsp}}12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan sought to turn James into a God-fearing, Protestant king who accepted the limitations of monarchy, as outlined in his [[treatise]] ''De Jure Regni apud Scotos''.&lt;ref&gt;Croft, Pauline (2003). King James. Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan, pp.{{nbsp}}13, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

While royal tutor he also held other offices: he was for a short time [[director of chancery]], and then became [[Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland]], a post which entitled him to a seat in the [[Parliament of Scotland|parliament]]. He appears to have continued in this office for some years, at least till 1579.

===Final years===
His last years were occupied with completion and publication of two of his major works, ''De Jure Regni apud Scotos'' (1579) and ''Rerum Scoticarum Historia'' (1582).

He died in his house on Kennedy's Close (near the modern Hunter Square) in [[Edinburgh]] on 28 September 1582 and was buried in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] on the following day. The grave was originally marked by a ''through-stone'' but this had sunk into the ground by 1701.&lt;ref&gt;Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, two memorials in Greyfriars each claim to mark his burial: one just north-west of the church and a second more modest memorial near the eastmost path.

==Works==

===Latin scholar===
For mastery of the [[Latin]] language, Buchanan has seldom been surpassed by any modern writer. His style is not rigidly modelled on that of any classical author, but has a freshness and elasticity of its own. Hugh Trevor-Roper called him "by universal consent, the greatest Latin writer, whether in prose or in verse, in sixteenth century Europe". He wrote Latin as if it were his [[mother tongue]]. Buchanan also had a rich vein of poetical feeling, and much originality of thought. His translations of the ''Psalms'' and of the Greek plays are more than mere versions; his two tragedies, ''Baptistes'' and ''Jephthes'', enjoyed a European reputation for academic excellence. His ''Pompae'' verses were written for performance at the court entertainments of Mary, including the ''Offering of the Rustic Gods'' sung during a masque devised by [[Bastian Pagez]] for the baptism of [[James VI of Scotland|King James]].&lt;ref&gt;Shire, Helena Mennie, ''Song Dance and Poetry at the Court of James VI'', CUP (1969), 56: Buchanan, George, ''Omnia Opera'', vol.{{nbsp}}2 (1725), pp.{{nbsp}}399–405&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prose works===
In addition to these works, Buchanan wrote in prose ''Chamaeleon'', a satire in [[Scots language|Scots]] against [[Maitland of Lethington]], first printed in 1711; a Latin translation of [[Thomas Linacre|Linacre]]'s ''Grammar'' (Paris, 1533); ''Libellus de Prosodia'' (Edinburgh, 1640); and ''Vita ab ipso scripta biennio ante mortem'' (1608), edited by [[R. Sibbald]] (1702). His other poems are ''Fratres Fraterrimi'', ''Elegiae'', ''Silvae'', two sets of verses entitled ''Hendecasyllabon Liber'' and ''Iambon Liber''; three books of ''[[Epigram]]mata''; a book of miscellaneous [[Poetry|verse]]; ''De Sphaera'' (in five books), suggested by the poem ''[[De sphaera mundi]]'' of [[Joannes de Sacrobosco]], and intended as a defence of the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] theory against the new [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] view.

There are two early editions of Buchanan's works: [[Thomas Ruddiman]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ruddiman |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Ruddiman |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Freebairn |year=1715 |title=Georgii Buchanani Scoti, Poetarum sui seculi facile principis, Opera Omnia }}. {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pieter Burman the Elder|Pieter Burman]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ruddiman|1725}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late works===
The first of his important late works was the treatise ''De Jure Regni apud Scotos'', published in 1579. In this famous work, composed in the form of a [[dialogue]], and evidently intended to instil sound political principles into the mind of his pupil, Buchanan lays down the doctrine that the source of all political power is the people, that the king is bound by those conditions under which the supreme power was first committed to his hands, and that it is lawful to resist, even to punish, [[tyrant]]s. The importance of the work is proved by the persistent efforts of the legislature to suppress it during the century following its publication. It was condemned by [[act of parliament]] in 1584, and again in 1664; and in 1683 it was burned by the [[University of Oxford]].

The second of his larger works is the ''History of Scotland'', ''Rerum Scoticarum Historia'', completed shortly before his death, and published in 1582. It is remarkable for the power and richness of its style, and of great value for the period personally known to the author, which occupies the greater portion of the book. The earlier part is based, to a considerable extent, on the legendary history of [[Boece]]. Buchanan's purpose was to "purge" the national history ''"of sum Inglis lyis and Scottis vanite"'' (Letter to Randolph). He said that it would "content few and displease many"; in fact, its matter gave so much offence that a proclamation was issued calling in all copies of it, as well as of the ''De Jure Regni'', that they might be purged of the "offensive and extraordinary matters" which they contained.

===Lasting legacy===
Buchanan holds his great and unique place in literature not so much for his own writings as for his strong and lasting influence on subsequent writers. His influence was notable by 1726 when [[Andrew Millar]], a prominent 18th-century bookseller, took over James McEuen's bookshop in London at the sign of 'Buchanan's Head, [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]'. The sign for the shop depicted the face of George Buchanan, a testament to Buchanan's early place and reputation in Scottish letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/5.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from Andrew Millar to Robert Woodrow, July 15, 1725. See footnote no. 1.|website=millar-project.ed.ac.uk|access-date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern publications and influence==
[[Polygon Books]] have published the poet [[Robert Crawford (Scottish poet)|Robert Crawford]]'s selection of Buchanan's verse in ''Apollos of the North: Selected Poems of George Buchanan and [[Arthur Johnston (poet)|Arthur Johnston]]'' ({{ISBN|1-904598-81-1}}) in 2006, the 500th anniversary of Buchanan's birth.

In the lead-up to the anniversary Professor Roger Mason of the [[University of St Andrews]] has published ''A Dialogue on the Law of Kingship among the Scots, a critical edition and translation of George Buchanan's 'De Iure Regni apud Scotos Dialogus'' ({{ISBN|1-85928-408-6}}).

'''Gissar Range''' ({{lang-ru|Гиссарский хребет}}; {{lang-tg|Қаторкӯҳи Ҳисор}}, ''Qatorköhi Hisor''; {{lang-uz|Hisor tizmasi}}; also known as '''Hissar''' or '''Hisor''' Range) is a [[mountain range]] in [[Central Asia]], in the western part of the [[Pamir-Alay]] system, stretching over 200&amp;nbsp;km in the general east-west direction across the territory of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. 
==Geography==
The Gissar Range lies south of the [[Zarafshan Range|Zeravshan Range]], extending north of [[Dushanbe]] through Tajikistan's [[Hisor district|Gissar District]] of the [[Districts of Republican Subordination]] and reaching Uzbekistan at the north tip of [[Surxondaryo Province|Surkhandarya Province]].&lt;ref&gt;''Atlas of the Soviet Central Asian Republics'', Geodesy and Cartography Authority, Moscow, 1988, in Russian.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest point in the Gissar Range at {{convert|4643|m|ft|sp=us}} is located in Uzbekistan on the border with Tajikistan, just north-west of [[Dushanbe]]. Formerly known as ''Peak of the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party'', the [[Khazret Sultan]] is also the [[List of countries by highest point|highest point in all Uzbekistan]]. The Gissar Range is composed of [[crystalline rock]]s, [[schist]], and [[sandstone]], punctured by [[granite]] intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article010747.html Big Soviet Encyclopedia, on-line edition], accessed April 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Nature
Hissar (Gissar) Valley, which encompasses the Shirkent National Park is a {{convert|3000|ha}} reserve, which is expected to be expanded to some {{convert|30000|ha}} in the coming years, has an unusually high concentration of sites of historical and scientific interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paramountjourney.com/destinations/hissar-valley/ Hissar Mountain Range], accessed December 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hindu studies''' is the study of the traditions and practices of the [[Indian subcontinent]], especially [[Hinduism]]. Beginning with British [[philology]] in the colonial period, Hindu studies has been practiced largely by Westerners, due in part to the lack of a distinct department for religion in Indian academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IeFApZpwZa8C|title=Religious Studies: A Global View|first=Gregory D.|last=Alles|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s this has caused some dissent from Hindus, raising questions in academia about the role of Hindu studies in creating [[postcolonial]] images of India.

==Philological era==
Between the period 1789 and 1832, British perceptions of Indian culture were completely reversed. Before that time, the British viewed Indians as disorganized and lacking a coherent philosophy. After the mid-19th century, however, the term "Hinduism" became acceptable in English use to refer to an overarching religious structure that spanned India. This was not a one-sided fabrication, since self-identified Hindus met the British challenge with a reappropriation of "Hinduism" and defense of their own culture.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Kemble Pennington, ''Was Hinduism Invented?''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The early study of Hinduism chiefly constituted translations of and commentaries on [[Sanskrit]] texts, rather than observation of present-day Hindu life. This historical emphasis on philology has had a strong influence on present day Hindu studies, which often emphasizes medieval and classical period Hinduism.

==Later researchers==
By the time [[Wendy Doniger]] became involved with Hindu studies, the nature of Hinduism as a single category was already in question, having been discussed in [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]]'s ''The Meaning and End of Religion'' (1962). In a general-audience response, she claimed in the ''[[Wilson Quarterly]]'' (1991) that Hinduism could be imagined as a "[[Venn diagram]]" which together constituted a whole, or akin to light being [[Wave–particle duality|both a wave and a particle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy Doniger]]. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/40258118 Hinduism by Any Other Name]". ''[[Wilson Quarterly]]'' 15.3 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctoral programs in Hinduism studies==

Since the mid nineteen nineties, some universities have started to offer doctoral programs in Hindu Theology. One of the universities is Hindu University of America, accredited by the National Public Schools Alliance which is not recognized as an accrediting agency by the U.S. Department of Education.&lt;ref name=NPSAA&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutions that may be operating illegally in South Carolina Or operating illegally elsewhere and enrolling residents of South Carolina (updated 03/04/2014)|url=http://www.che.sc.gov/CHE_Docs/AcademicAffairs/License/Illegally_Operating.pdf|publisher=South Carolina Commission on Higher Education|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Beginning in the 1990s, North American Hindu groups began protesting the academic portrayal of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;Arti Dhand. "Hinduism to Hindus in the Western Diaspora." ''Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion'' 17.3 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; This began in 1995 with the publication of ''[[Kali's Child]]'', [[Jeffrey Kripal]]'s [[psychoanalytic]] biography of [[Ramakrishna]]. In 1995, the book won the [[American Academy of Religion]] award. The book became controversial and Kripal himself became deeply involved in discussing the book with Hindu critics and western scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kalischi/|title=Kali's Child|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="balu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balagangadhara|first=S.N. |author2=Sarah Claerhout|date=Spring 2008|title=Are Dialogues Antidotes to Violence? Two Recent Examples From Hinduism Studies|journal=Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies|volume=7|issue=19|pages=118–143|url=http://www.jsri.ro/new/?download=19_balagangadhara_claerhout.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another controversial [[psychoanalytical]] is by Paul B. Courtright's ''Ganesa: Lord of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings''. Courtright responded that he did not see anything coming out of the Hindu criticism that was worth responding to;&lt;ref&gt;Paul B. Courtright. "[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_american_academy_of_religion/v074/74.3courtright.html The Self-Serving Humility of Disciplining Liberal Humanist Scholars"]. ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 74.3 (2006), 752-755&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy Doniger, for her part, quickly stopped responding to Hindu complaints, and after being egged at a lecture in Britain canceled a talk in Bengal.&lt;ref name="uc"&gt;Amy M. Braverman. [http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0412/features/index.shtml "The interpretation of gods"]. ''University of Chicago Magazine'', 97.2 (December 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same Britain conference, Wendy Doniger was questioned about her qualifications to speak on Hinduism. According to witnesses, she avoided giving an answer when asked whether she had herself been psychoanalyzed.&lt;ref name="arvnds" /&gt;

In 2002, [[Rajiv Malhotra]] founder of Infinity foundation rekindled the debate with a [[blog]] post called "RISA Lila - 1: Wendy's Child Syndrome".&lt;ref name="arvnds"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Arvind |date=Spring 2004|title=Hindus and Scholars|journal=Religion in the news|publisher=[[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]]|volume=7|issue=1|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/csrpl/RINVol7No1/Hindus%20and%20Scholars.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Malhotra questioned the application of Freudian psychoanalytical approach in the study of Hinduism and argued that this has been discredited among Western Psychologists and the scholars were not trained psychoanalysts and the approach was not applicable to non-Western subjects.&lt;ref name="Kurien_202"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurien|first=Prema |authorlink=Prema Kurien|title=A place at the multicultural table: the development of an American Hinduism|year=2007|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONMxZc5_saYC&amp;pg=PA202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published on Sulekha.com, the article was widely read.&lt;ref name="Kurien_202"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Nussbaum|Martha C. Nussbaum]], ''The Clash Within: Democracy, Religious Violence, and India's Future'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2009), p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 ''[[Invading the Sacred]]'', a book written by a multitude of professors including Antonio De Nicholas of Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the [[State University of New York]], psychoanalyst [[Alan Roland]], [[S.N. Balagangadhara]], Pandita Indrani Rampersad and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Contributors|url=http://invadingthesacred.com/content/view/25/39/|accessdate=7 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714222654/http://invadingthesacred.com/content/view/25/39/|archivedate=14 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aimed to counter-analyze and refute the dominant narrative of Hindu studies. [[Anantanand Rambachan]] wrote that "there can be little doubt about the importance and legitimacy of many of the concerns raised by the authors of Invading the Sacred about the academic study of Hinduism in the United States."&lt;ref name="rambachan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rambachan|first=Anantanand |title=Hindu Studies|journal=[[International Journal of Hindu Studies]] |date=April 2008|volume=12|issue=1|pages=81–101|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/67176684m04174x3/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insider/outsider problem===
The Hindu criticism of Western Hindu studies relies on the terms [[etic and emic]] to explain what is missing from Western interpretations. The authors of ''[[Invading the Sacred]]'' by and large claim that the outsider, etic, perspective has historically shielded scholars from feeling affected by their judgments. However, Shrinivas Tilak writes that insider, emic, scholars must take care to avoid bias as well.&lt;ref&gt;Shrinivas Tilak. [http://tilak.sulekha.com/blog/post/2004/01/taking-back-hindu-studies.htm "Taking Back Hindu Studies"]. In John Stratton Hawley and Vasudha Narayanan, eds., ''The Life of Hinduism''. University of California Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell T. McCutcheon]], the author of ''Critics Not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public Study of Religion'', has used the controversy as a means to present his own perspective on the insider/outsider problem. In his article "It's a Lie. There's No Truth in It! It's a Sin!", McCutcheon focuses on the attitude of the scholars, who he thinks are going too far in trying to unify the concerns of the Hindus with their own interests. McCutcheon himself believes that ''rejecting'' the worldviews of the insiders is essential if religious scholars aim to be something other than "dedicated disciples to one set of voices."&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell T. McCutcheon]]. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_american_academy_of_religion/v074/74.3mccutcheon01.html "It's a Lie. There's No Truth in It! It's a Sin!": On the Limits of the Humanistic Study of Religion and the Costs of Saving Others from Themselves]. ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion 74.3'' (2006), 747&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that Hindu scholars should make it clear that they are presenting a view that is ''critical'' of Hinduism, because presenting a non-critical view means "the end of the human sciences as we know them."&lt;ref&gt;McCutcheon 2006, 736&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing specific Hindu scholars, McCutcheon sides with Courtright et al. by holding the view that ''"as scholars we have an intellectual and institution imperative to, at times, study people precisely in ways unwelcome by them."'' &lt;ref&gt;McCutcheon 2006, 729-730&lt;/ref&gt; However, the authors of [[Invading the Sacred]] assert that they  critique [[etic]] Western evaluations of Hinduism ''"not because it is offensive or politically incorrect, but because it is baseless and untruthful."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?234969|title=Invading The Sacred|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCutcheon places himself in opposition to [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]], one of the leading figures of 20th century religious studies, who wrote that religious traditions must always be taught in a way acceptable to insiders.&lt;ref&gt;WC Smith. "Comparative religion: whither--and why?" In Eliade and Kitagawa, ''The History of Religions''. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[S.N. Balagangadhara]] also points out that "some of these 'dialogues' exacerbate violence; they do not reduce it".&lt;ref  name="balu"/&gt;

===Defining Hinduism===
Malhotra's conclusion, however, was that Wendy Doniger was using her authority as a scholar to overrule the culture's self-identity: "Rights of individual scholars must be balanced against rights of cultures and communities they portray, especially minorities that often face intimidation. Scholars should ''criticize'' but not ''define'' another's religion." Doniger denies that she is defining Hinduism.&lt;ref name="uc"/&gt;

'''Huandacareo''' (or Guandacareo)&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oliveros |first=J. Arturo |date= |title=Zona Arqueológica de Huandacareo |trans-title=Huandacareo Archaeological Site |journal=INAH |location= Mexico |url= http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za01301.html |language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an archaeological zone located about 60 kilometers north of the city of [[Morelia]], in the state of [[Michoacán]].

The site was constructed on an elevated plateau overlooking the Cuitzeo lake, some 2.46 kilometers (1.52&amp;nbsp;mi.) from its north western shores and about two kilometers from the center of the Huandacareo town and municipality.&lt;ref name=Visit &gt;{{cite web |first= Marianne C. |last=Clément |title=Huandacareo Site Visit notes and photographs |url= |publisher= |trans-title= |date=January 30, 2011 |accessdate=Feb 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locally the place is better known as "The Nopalera".

The site is located on the western side of [[Lake Cuitzeo]], located at around {{coord|19|56|0|N|101|5|0|W|type:waterbody_region:MX}}. It has an area of 300–400&amp;nbsp;km².

The lake is astatic, and the volume and level of water in the lake fluctuates frequently. It is the second largest freshwater lake in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Galindo de Obario, Marcela. "Water Quality and its Spatial Variability in Lake Cuitzeo, Mexico" 2005. International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation, Enschede, Netherlands. [http://www.itc.nl/library/Papers_2005/msc/wrem/galindo.pdf ITC.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this site is of a clear Purépecha ancestry, the geographic location on the Cuitzeo basin and the ceremonial center concept, attests to the presence of some cultural elements originating elsewhere. As an example [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] from the "cerro de Zináparo" in northern Michoacán or from [[Zinapécuaro]] east of Cuitzeo can be noted; as well as coastal materials, especially the Pacific Ocean. Also from the Mexican plateau and certainly from the Purépecha region of Pátzcuaro, that provided the main cultural influence.&lt;ref name=Huanda &gt;{{cite web |title= Huandacareo |url= http://www.huandarqueologia.galeon.com/ |publisher=Arqueologia Michocan Mexico

==Background==

The site is located in the '''Michoacán''' ({{IPA-es|mitʃoaˈkan}}) region. The name Michoacán is from [[Nahuatl]] and means "place of the fishermen" referring to those who fish on [[Lake Pátzcuaro]].&lt;ref name="introduccion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.mx/mich/mich-intro.html |title=El Estado de Michoacán Introduccion |publisher=UMSNH |location=Morelia, Michoacán |language=Spanish |trans-title=The State of Michoacan Introduction |accessdate=June 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719163442/http://www.umich.mx/mich/mich-intro.html |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In prehispanic times, the area was the home of the [[Purépecha Empire]], which rivaled the [[Aztec Empire]]. The state has today native members of the Purépecha people as well as [[Otomi people|Otomis]] and [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]].

According to the archeological evidence, there has been human habitation within the territory of Michoacán state for at least 10,000 years.&lt;ref name="elochis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_michoacan |title=Historia |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Michoacán |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal, |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=History |accessdate=June 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162648/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_michoacan |archivedate=May 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-Hispanic period there were a number of waves of migration into the area, including the Pirinda, Nahua, Huetamo, Colima, Purépecha and other peoples.&lt;ref name="prehis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/prehisp.html |title=El Estado de Michoacán Epoca Prehispanica |publisher=UMSNH |location=Morelia, Michoacán |language=Spanish |trans-title=The State of Michoacan Pre-Hispanic Era |accessdate=June 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124211111/http://www.umich.mx/mich/historia/prehisp.html |archivedate=January 24, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are sites of formal settlements from all Mesoamerican period. Important sites include [[El Opeño]] and those in [[Curutarán]], [[Tepalcatepec]] [[Apatzingán]], [[Zinapécuaro]] and [[Coalcomán de Vázquez Pallares|Coalcoman]]. The territory has been inhabited by the Nahuas, Otomis, [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]]s, Pirindas and Tecos as well as the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]].&lt;ref name="elochis"/&gt;
Archeological sites found in the state, have helped clarify the historical origin and [[ethnicity]] development of [[Michoacán]]. It dates back to the Mesoamerican formative or preclassical period (1500 to 200 BCE), the classical period (200 BCE to 1000 CE) and the post-classical (800 to 1000 CE). Those sites include: [[El Opeño]], Curutarán, la Villita, [[Tepalcatepec]], [[Apatzingán]], Zinapécuaro, [[Coalcomán]], San Felipe de los Alzati, [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]], [[Tingambato]], [[Pátzcuaro]], [[Zacapu]], [[Uruapan]], Tzitzio, etc.

The main pre-Hispanic civilization of the state is that of the Purépecha, which was centered in the Lake Pátzcuaro area.&lt;ref name="elochis"/&gt; Before the 13th century, both Nahua and Purépecha peoples were here, sustaining themselves by agriculture and fishing. The Purépecha are descendants of a late arrival of [[Chichimeca]]s who came from the north. At Lake Patzcuaro, they came upon people with similar cultures to their own but who were more technically and socially advanced. The formation of the Purépecha state began in the 13th century, when these people started their own dominion at Uayameo, today [[Santa Fe de la Laguna]] and becoming dominant over the entire Lake Patzcuaro area by the 15th century. Conquest of neighboring tribes and territories occurred between 1401 and 1450, absorbing peoples with different cultures and languages into the empire. By the late 15th century, this state rivaled that of the Aztecs, expanding their territory over much of what is now Michoacán and into part of [[Colima]], [[Nayarit]], [[Querétaro]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Guerrero]] and [[Jalisco]]. The Aztecs attempted to invade Purépecha but were repelled. This would later cause the Purépecha to deny the Aztecs aid in the defense of [[Tenochtitlan]] against the Spanish.&lt;ref name="elochis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prehis"/&gt;

The Michoacán history has been studied from archaeological evidence and historical documents, such as the literary work "Relación de Michoacán", written in 1524 by Frair Jeronimo de Alcalá.&lt;ref name=Rela &gt;{{cite web |author1=Franco Mendoza, Moisés |author2=Martínez Ibáñez, Clotilde |author3=Molina Ruiz, Carmen |title= Jerónimo de Alcalá, Relación de Michoacán, |url= http://etzakutarakua.colmich.edu.mx/proyectos/relaciondemichoacan/rm/indiceRM.asp
|publisher= El Colegio de Michoacán, Gobierno del Estado de Michoacán (p.340) |location= México |language= Spanish |trans-title= Jerónimo de Alcalá, Relación de Michoacán |year= 2000 |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence it is known that the first settlers of the region were several Chichimeca tribes which arrived in different times, and therefore evolved differently.

===Toponymy===
According to INAH, the Huandacareo name is a [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] word: Uandakua that has several meanings such as "Trial Place", "Speaker Place" or "tribunal".

According to another version&lt;ref name=Enci&gt;{{cite web |title= Reseña Histórica. Huandacareo, Michoacán |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/michoacan/mpios/16036a.htm |publisher= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México |language= Spanish |trans-title=  |year=  |accessdate= Sep 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110616192119/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/michoacan/mpios/16036a.htm |archivedate= 2011-06-16 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Huandacareo word, is of [[Chichimeca]] origin and translates as "Preaching Place", as it derives from the "huandaca" word that means "speech".

=== Chichimec culture ===
'''Chichimeca''' was the name that the [[Nahua peoples]] of Mexico generically applied to a wide range of semi-[[nomad]]ic peoples who inhabited the north of modern-day [[Mexico]] and [[southwestern United States]], and carried the same sense as the European term "[[barbarian]]". The name was adopted with a pejorative tone by the Spaniards when referring especially to the semi-nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples of northern Mexico. In modern times only one ethnic group is customarily referred to as Chichimecs, namely the [[Chichimeca Jonaz]], although lately this usage is being changed for simply "Jonáz" or their own name for themselves "''Úza''".

The [[Chichimeca]] peoples were in fact many different groups with varying ethnic and linguistic affiliations. As the Spaniards worked towards consolidating the rule of [[New Spain]] over the Mexican native peoples during the 16th and 17th centuries, the "Chichimecan tribes" maintained a resistance. A number of ethnic groups of the region allied against the Spanish, and the following military colonization of northern Mexico has become known as the "[[Chichimeca War]]s".

Many of the peoples called Chichimeca are virtually unknown today; few descriptions mention them and they seem to have been absorbed into [[mestizo]] culture or into other native ethnic groups. For example, virtually nothing is known about the peoples referred to as ''[[Guachichil]]es'', ''[[Caxcan]]es'', ''[[Zacateco]]s'', ''[[Tecuexe]]s'', or ''[[Guamare]]s''. Others like the ''[[Opata]]'' or "''Eudeve''" are well described but extinct as a people.

=== Purépecha culture ===
{{main|Purépecha culture}}
The Purépecha area has been inhabited at least since the early [[Mesoamerican chronology|Pre-classic period]].  Early lithic evidence from before 2500 B.C. like [[Folsom point|fluted points]] and stone utensils are found at some [[Megafauna]] kill sites. The earliest radio-carbon dates of archeological sites fall around 1200 B.C.  The best known early Pre-classic culture of Michoacán was the [[Chupicuaro culture]]. Chupícuaro sites are mostly found on lake islands which can be seen as a sign of it having traits relating it to the later Purépecha cultural patterns.  In the early Classic period, [[Mesoamerican Ballgame|ballcourts]] and other artifacts demonstrate a [[Teotihuacan]] influence in the Michoacán region.

In the late classic at least two non-Purépecha ethnic groups lived around Lake Pátzcuaro: Nahuatl speakers in Jarácuaro, and some Chichimecan cultures on the northern banks, with the Nahua population being the second largest.

According to the ''Relación de Michoacán''&lt;ref name=Rela /&gt; a visionary leader of the Purépecha named [[Taríacuri]] decided to gather the communities around Lake Pátzcuaro into one strong state. Around 1300 he undertook the first conquests and installed his sons Hiripan and Tangáxoan as lords of [[Ihuatzio]] and [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]] respectively, himself ruling from Pátzcuari city. By the death of Taríacuri (around 1350), his lineage was in control of all the major centers around Lake Pátzcuaro.  His son Hiripan continued the expansion into the area surrounding [[Lake Cuitzeo]].

The people of the [[Purépecha Empire]] were mostly of [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] ethnic affiliation but also included other ethnic groups such as the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]] and [[Chichimec]].  These ethnic groups were gradually assimilated into the Purépecha majority group.

=== Chupícuaro culture ===
This culture is important due to the influence it had in the area. It is possible it spread to southern United States, 500 BCE. There are theories that the first Guanajuato inhabitants belonged to this culture.&lt;ref name=Leon &gt;{{cite web |title= Historia prehispánica |url= http://www.leon-gto.com.mx/la-ciudad-leon/epoca-prehispanica/ |publisher= León-Gto |trans-title=Prehispanic History |year= |accessdate= October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramics of this culture is earlier than the classical mesoamerican period, includes angular figurines with geometric shapes. The Acámbaro museum exhibit pieces from the Purépecha, Mazahua, and Otomi cultures.&lt;ref name=Leon/&gt;

Apparently the Chupícuaro culture developed in a vast territory, or it was defined as Chupícuaro style or tradition (Beatriz Braniff) in, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Guerrero, Mexico State, Hidalgo, Colima, Nayarit, Querétaro and Zacatecas. It is estimated that Chupícuaro facilitated the northward expansion of Mesoamerican elements (cultural roots of western Mexico and perhaps Northwest, comparable with the Olmec culture throughout Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Jiménez Moreno, 1959: 1043.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chupícuaro]] had an important cultural development and expansion of its style in distant areas from the diffusing center and influenced ceramic traditions, which lasted until the end of the classical period, and even into the Postclassical, as seen in Purépecha Michoacán ceramic.&lt;ref name=Boletin&gt;{{cite web|title=Boletín de Cultura Chupícuaro |url=http://www.acambaro.gob.mx/uaip/museo/cultura%20chupicuaro.pdf |publisher=Local Acámbaro Museum |location=Guanajuato |language=Spanish |trans-title=Chuícuaro Cultural Bulletin |year= |accessdate=October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717170559/http://www.acambaro.gob.mx/uaip/museo/cultura%20chupicuaro.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1985, at the first prehispanic societies meeting, in relation to the Chupícuaro culture it was noted, that Chupícuaro tradition ceramics manufacturing groups, should be considered part of Mesoamerican stratified societies, with a definite political and territorial structure and not as isolated village societies, lacking ceremonial centers and architecture. From that first impulse, subsequent social groups presented own cultural expressions, at regional level in the Mesoamerican context.&lt;ref&gt;Crespo, et al., 1988:259.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Site==
[[File:Huandacareo, south east structure access.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Detail of the south-east structure]]
The construction of this ceremonial center is estimated towards year 1200 CE, and it functioned until 1536, when Spaniard destruction of the Purépecha civilization occurred.&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

This is confirmed by the finding of a prehispanic characteristics burial, in which several European glass pieces were found, which means that when these materials were present in the Mexico plateau, in western Mesoamerica prevailed prehispanic cultural patterns.&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

===Discovery and investigations===
The first excavations season commenced in December 1977.

The site was vandalized by plunderers since the beginning of the last century, had excavated the site removing artifacts and by farmers that cultivated on the structures. Up to that time no archaeological work had been made in this region that revealed any antecedents for the need to initiate works.&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

The site topography was the only clue as to location of the structures, since initially there were visible signs of them; mounds could be seen mainly at the top of the hill. Once the first wall was found, it was named Structure A, excavations were extended following in both directions, removing dirt and rubbish.&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;
[[File:Huandacareo, main structure east side.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Western side of Temple on main structure, the lake on the background to the south]]

In addition to Structure A, other structures were found around the site. It is important to point out that according to Purépecha architectonic tradition, temples and their foundations always were built on top of natural hills, over an artificial platform, or, as in the Huandacareo case, over platforms and plazas, for this purpose they built retention walls embedded to the mountain slopes.&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

The site has been reconstructed, to differentiate original sections from those reconstructed; new sections are recessed five centimeter in average from the original sections.&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

From the first excavations season of 1977, five more seasons took place ending in 1983, since then, no further work has been performed. As a result of the little attention the place is neglected.&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

===Historical brief===
The site dates back to pre-Hispanic times and was part of the region oldest cultures in the region, known as "Chupícuaro", which was based in the creeks of the Cuitzeo Lake. They received Teotihuacán and pre-Purépecha influence. Later they were conquered by Purépechas, to whom tributes were paid.

According to tradition, the Cazonci,&lt;ref&gt;Caltzontzin or irecha, was the Purépecha name for their maximum governor&lt;/ref&gt; leading an army, marched towards Yuriria-Púndaro to fight certain tribes that were attacking the place and, after defeating them, the victorious army while returning home via the Cuitzeo Lake, stopped somewhere near the lake shores, to participate in festivities that celebrated the victory. Cazonci listened to numerous speeches in his honor and in agreement with tradition, as of that moment the place was called Huandacareo.

Huandacareo is one of many sites around the Cuitzeo Lake basin. It is a culturally important zone within the Michoacan region, from lake resources exploitation evidence from pre-Hispanic times. There are few studies of this type paleolithic environment in the country, in spite of information offered to anthropology. These include testimonies of the nutritional and artisan products that have been obtained throughout history, but also about the communication and transportation used by people. Not counting their importance until recently, such as hundreds of bird flocks refuge that migrate to hibernate. Given specific natural conditions, these ecological niches then worked to tie diverse human groups within the essential ancient trade networks.

Part of the historical information about this site, comes from the "Relación de Michoacan" (1542), the essential 16th century document that makes reference to this native community. By such reference it is known that the place was dominated by the Purépecha, from at least 300 years before Spaniards arrival. Data confirmed by archaeological excavations and objects found. Among these materials are not only the elegant typical pottery, negative decorated or pipes, but also metal objects, like bells, "fistoles", clamps or axes that demonstrates the presence of diversely applied metallurgical techniques. Most of these manufactures have older trajectories, product of millenarian cultural traditions. Thus in the sample place were found older objects. At the same time, these allowed to visualize the relation of this place with other neighboring communities and important cities, such as Teotihuacán, many years before the Purépecha arrival.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Within offerings and local architecture diverse exogenous raw materials and elements were found in the objects; including stone slabs for construction. Together with these materials, also found carved green stone slabs, turquoise, or projectile tips and obsidian ornaments from different mine sources, copper and gold; as well as marine shells from the Pacific Ocean. This confirms the antiquity of the place, its strategic importance within the communication routes, and mainly the political and commercial control at that time.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

=== Objects found ===
Among findings in the Huandacareo archaeological site, are several copper tools, including eye needles, some 35 centimeters long. Also of made copper, but with ornamental and ritual purposes, found the following magnificent examples:&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

* Clamps. Important by their quantity and beauty, the clamps that were used not only to shave but also as adornment and to define a social hierarchy. These clamps appear on chronicles representations, these clamps are hung on the neck of important personages.
* Wire hoops. Many wire hoops with rectangular and circular section, these were frequently found in primary burials, probably used as earrings.
* Bells of several types and sizes, of false filigree and worked metal sheets.
* A very wide hoop was found with bells of worked metal, surrounded by soldiers, perhaps was used on a command baton.
* Ornaments consisting of an inverted U shaped bar, finished with animal heads, possibly eagles with small bells hanging from their beak. The gold metallurgy samples are made on laminated gold and worked with hammers, possibly part of funerary material.
* Beads, four semi cylindrical pieces, perhaps part of a necklace, the existence of these objects demonstrate the high technological level reached by group (items originating from Chupícuaro and Pátzcuaro), which was only possible in towns whose solid economic base allowed them to have specialized craftsmen working full-time.

As far as Huandacareo Ceramics a complete pipe was found, representing an owl (tecolote).&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

Other ceramic objects worth mentioning are globular pieces, many with sgraffito: one of the most usual designs is one of lines that made up the infinite symbol. Also there are many "malacates" some decorated; their presence demonstrates the extended practice of vegetal fiber weave, mainly cotton. Special note is made of figurines found in this area. Their general feature is solid brown color pieces of several tones. All found are adult feminine figures, it is necessary to remember that feminine is related to lunar deities, all associated with agriculture, and aquatic related to fishing, both activities of sedentary societies; the heads of these figures appear deformed with front-occipital tabular type.&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

Also found, associated with an infant burial, was a gorgeous feminine figure about 14 centimeters tall, that carries a breast feeding boy about two years old astride; both figures display the deformed skull and have band hairdos that resemble the distorting instrument. The mother also wears a skirt and ornaments such as earflaps and necklace. Other animal figures found; these are small, solid, dark brown color, molded and unpolished. It was noted that all pieces found represent dogs, even though as is known there is a wide variety of fauna in the region. It is worth remembering that the Purépecha culture worshiped dogs.&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

As far as their detailed work knowledge, these are samples found:&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

* Domestic utensils: metates, mortar and "Tejolotes or Temachin" (grinding stone), metal fragments without and without support.
* Tools: ceramic polishers and other of bigger size, possibly for skin tanning.
* Sculpture: The fragment of the face of an old man found is very important, traditionally related to the God of the fire, divinity on which the [[Purépecha religion]] was based; it is believed that this sculpture is one of the few representations of Curicaueri (Sp.), "the great fire" or "Great burner).
* Ritual: discs made from slate, have been found measuring 16 centimeters diameter average, some with two symmetrical perforations. There is evidence in Huandacareo that these discs were used as clasps in the burials of high social hierarchy individuals.
* Various: 5 centimeters average stone spheres, made in obsidian, as with other pieces, no manufacturing remains or factories have been found, hence it is assumed that the pieces were imported from other places.

Such is the case, for the following found objects:&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

* Tools: projectile ends pressure re-touched and with base or extension; prismatic knives, some altered to make projectile ends, pins, cutters and knives, among others.
* Ornaments: extraordinary quality appraised, mainly tubular and spool earflaps, some are so thin that are translucent; also found some beautiful samples of "bezotes" (worn by high chiefs).
* Ritual: green obsidian ornaments as rich offerings for high rank individuals. Such is the case of pieces found within skull in some burials, as if these were placed in the person’s mouth; these pieces are spherical or semi-square and always of green stone. In these same conditions a small rectangular piece was found, with an edge perforation, of a dark green stone and so polished that it seems mirror.

As far as Shell and Bone items, without a doubt the most important Purépecha culture items found here were made from these materials. The presence of these materials demonstrates that the settlers maintained contact with people from both coasts, whether for commerce or some other type of interchange, for example:&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

* Small trimmed snail necklaces with perforations.
* Circular Hoops catalogued as bracelets… human soldiers’ figures, naked without gender beings, and with a hieratic position, dancers with a shell incrusted forming an eye.
[[File:Huandacareo, south west structure burials.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Location of burials, south western corner]]

Human burials containing human bones found in Huandacareo:
* Shaft Tomb excavated in tepetate that resembles the [[El Opeño]], (Jacona, Michoacán) from the Preclassical period, although the Huandacareo tomb, from the cultural materials found as offering, it must be placed in the period immediately previous to the arrival of the Spaniards; the burial found corresponds to a primary burial of an old person and to a secondary burial of an adult.
* Six tombs were built on a perfectly outlined patio, one of them unfinished; there is another one associated to this group with the same characteristics; the walls are made with stone blocks perfectly cut and jointed with mortar; the floor is compacted earth; the tombs are covered by large stone slabs, some with worked edges. The location dimensions of six of them is very interesting as they were constructed symmetrically; in the central part of the group, the slab forming the roof of tomb number 2 serves as weight to number 4, that is oriented perpendicularly, with a cruciform aspect although in fact they are two rectangles. Each grave contained remains of an adult primary burial accompanied by rich and numerous offerings consisting of pottery, shell objects, bone and stone tools. A three by eighteen ditch was excavated, in which sixty three primary and secondary burials were found with numerous fragments clearly identified as decapitations or mutilations, that is to say, skulls with the atlas and maxillary bone in place or the bones of an arm with hand but without the rest of the body.

===Political Organization===
Authority was exerted through a hierarchical and coercive bureaucracy formed by civil employees who shared and invaded administrative, judicial, military and religious functions.&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

The central governmental apparatus based in Pátzcuaro and later in Tzintzuntzan was formed by: the Canzonci (governor), the Commander in chief (military), Deputies (collectors), the "Ocambecha" (reprimand or admonisher) and the "Petamuti" (greater priest). The Canzonci represented the Curicaueri God and as such governed and maintained alive the cult of the God.&lt;ref name=Huanda /&gt;

==Structures==
Even though everything seems to indicate that the place achieved its maximum enhancement and most visible constructions were built by 1200 CE, there are substructures and materials that correspond to earlier times; those related to the foundation of this center. Works accomplished have real impact on its history. What can be argued from one of the senses or meaning of its name: "Court", is the strategic importance for the Purépecha political and economic structure, to maintain this site in control of towns within its regime. It is pointed out, the construction of large reservoirs to lodge the mortuary remains of people socially important, in contrast with multiple burials directly in the ground; the majority with sacrifice evidence, beheaded and dismembered. These were located in front of one of the main buildings, known as "the Temple".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The explored part seems to indicate that the site was an administrative and religious center. It was built on a gentle hill slope, thus they had to build terraces with front retaining walls, to be able to level the ground and build constructions on them. Also such leveling forced the design and construction of water drainage channels. The presence of a sunken patio, as well as a construction of mixed plant (rectangular and circular) is an indication of a "yácata" (Tzintzuntzan); both constructions are samples of two different architectonic traditions, two cultural groups and two different time and space distributions. Remains of ancient housing units are underneath present day houses. This item needs to be confirmed.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Structures identified are the sunken plaza, Mound 1 and 2 in the Temple and the "tomb patio" are well-known; by their respective locations within the site, as for the constructive systems used to build them. Regional quarry white and pink stone was used, jointed with mud and there are remains of stuccoed surfaces, hardened with fire. Nevertheless, perhaps the most remarkable feature of the place is its physical and strategic location in front of Cuitzeo Lake.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The site construction, or what can be seen today, is located within a land plot of about 187 by 100 meters (614 by 238&amp;nbsp;ft.), it depicts a complex center. Whether its purpose was as a political, religious or administrative is actually not known, the official version remains full of speculative assumptions.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;

The site is oriented on an east–west axis, with the main structure on the north-eastern corner, other structures cover the entire southern side and remains of other basements are along the northern side.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;

===Main Structure===
[[File:Huandacareo, entrance to main structure.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Main structure, viewed from the south west corner]]
[[File:Huandacareo, main structure from west.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Access stairway to the temple from the west side, facing the sunken patio]]
The main structure, called as such for the sake of discussion, occupies the site north-west corner and it actually has four components, the sunken patio, small temple or altar to the north, a concentric circular basement and a Temple, east of the patio.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;

====Sunken Patio====
[[File:Huandacareo, main structure sunken patio.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Sunken patio, viewed from its south eastern corner]]
[[File:Huandacareo, main structure sunken patio 1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Detail of the south edge of the sunken patio, with the perimeter walk way and wall basement]]
The sunken patio (or plaza) is an irregularly shaped trapezoid, measures some 20 meters wide (65&amp;nbsp;ft.) on the south side, about 24 meters wide on the north side and it is about 30 meters (98&amp;nbsp;ft.) long.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;

It is surrounded by a double wall, which might have been a perimeter walkway. It has access stairs at the center of both, the south and north sides.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;

Although it is not known what its purpose actually was, its size and depth, resembles a pool. It could have been a ceremonial pool.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;

==== Small Temple ====
The sunken patio, on its northern side, has a stairway leading to a structure with several level platforms and remains of a structure, which possibly was an altar, related to events taking place in the complex.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;

==== Concentric Circular basement ====
[[File:Huandacareo, circular structure.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Concentric circular basement, north of the sunken patio]]
It is located at the northern most edge of the sunken patio-altar complex. It consists of two concentric stone circles, the outer circle measuring about 20 meters (65&amp;nbsp;ft.) in diameter, with no other visible structural remains. The circle is not complete, its south side, facing the altar is flat against the altar structure.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;

==== Temple ====
This temple was perhaps the most important component of the complex, it holds the highest position of the site, and its entrance faces west and the sunken patio. It has a series of passages or walled spaces on the eastern side and access stairways facing east and west.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;

The eastern side is somewhat destroyed, its stairway leads to the remains of an almost destroyed structure. At the foot of the structure, as part of the blocks forming the structure, a petroglyph, depicting an inverted human figure can be seen.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;
 
On the top of the temple, there were several covered and walled spaces used for unknown purposes.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;

===Other structures===
[[File:Huandacareo, main structure sunken patio north structure.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Detail of the north side of the sunken patio and temple]]
The balance of structures are irregularly shaped and are partly destroyed, hence it is difficult to assess their purpose or actual shape. There are apparent entrances, hall ways to private areas.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;

These structures were built on terraces and all surrounded by a perimeter wall, with different levels. Mostly were built on the southern side, overlooking the lake.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;

It is possible these were residential complexes, probably for high priests and governors of the city, heading ceremonies and events taking place at the complex.&lt;ref name=Visit /&gt;

==Other sites in Michoacán==
The Michoacán archaeological sites are mostly ancient Purepecha settlements, as the culture evolved in the entity and had political, administrative and religious headquarters in the region. Among the most important and visible sites are [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]] and [[Ihuatzio]] in the region [[Lake Pátzcuaro]]; Huandacareo and Tres Cerritos in the [[Lake Cuitzeo]] region; as well as San Felipe Alzati in the [[Zitácuaro]] region.

In addition, there are sites related to other prehispanic cultures, such as [[Tingambato]] or [[El Opeño]] archaeological sites area in the Jacona de Plancarte municipality, with important funerary remains hitherto considered the most ancient Mesoamerican tombs. More archaeological sites are being discovered, such as the city of [[La Piedad]], in the Zaragoza area, where several remains have been found and are being explored.

An '''incunable''', or sometimes '''incunabulum''' (plural '''incunables''' or '''incunabula''', respectively), is a [[book]], pamphlet, or [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]] [[printing|printed]] in [[Europe]] before the year 1501. (Importantly, incunabula are not [[manuscript]]s.) {{As of|2014|post=,}} there are about 30,000 distinct known incunable [[Edition (book)|edition]]s extant. The number of surviving copies in [[Germany]] alone is estimated at around 125,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Library]]: [http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html Incunabula Short Title Catalogue] gives 30,375 editions as of March 2014, which also includes some prints from the 16th century though (retrieved 23 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Bettina Wagner: "Das Second-Life der Wiegendrucke. Die Inkunabelsammlung der Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek", in: Griebel, Rolf; Ceynowa, Klaus (eds.): "Information, Innovation, Inspiration. 450 Jahre Bayerische Staatsbibliothek", K G Saur, München 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-598-11772-5}}, pp. 207–224 (207f.) the Incunabula Short Title Catalogue lists 30,375 titles published before 1501.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"Incunable" is the [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] singular form of ''incunabula'', [[Latin]] for "[[swaddling]] clothes" or "[[bassinet|cradle]]",&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Lewis and C. Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', Oxford 1879, p. 930. The word ''incunabula'' is a neuter plural only; the singular ''incunabulum'' is never found in Latin and not used in English by most specialists.&lt;/ref&gt; which can refer to "the earliest stages or first traces in the development of anything".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1933, I:188.&lt;/ref&gt; A former term for "incunable" is '''"fifteener"''',&lt;!--fifteener redirects here--&gt; referring to the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction to Incunabula | url=http://www.historicpages.com/texts/incun1.htm | publisher=Barber, Phil | accessdate=6 July 2017 | quote="Incunabula" is a generic term coined by English book collectors in the seventeenth century to describe the first printed books of the fifteenth century. It is a more elegant replacement for what had previously been called 'fifteeners', and is formed of two Latin words meaning literally 'in the cradle' or 'in swaddling clothes'. The word is plural; in referring to a single fifteenth century book, "incunabulum" is correct.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Fifteener" is a coinage of the bibliographer [[Thomas Frognall Dibdin]], a term endorsed by [[William Morris]] and [[Robert Proctor (bibliographer)|Robert Proctor]]. {{harv|Carter|Barker|2004|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''incunabula'' as a printing term was first used by the Dutch physician and humanist [[Hadrianus Junius|Hadrianus Iunius]] (Adriaan de Jonghe, 1511–1575) and appears in a passage from his posthumous work (written in 1569): Hadrianus Iunius, ''Batavia'', [...], [Lugduni Batavorum], ex officina Plantiniana, apud Franciscum Raphelengium, '''1588''', p. 256 l. 3: «inter prima artis [typographicae] '''incunabula'''», a term ("the first infancy of printing") to which he arbitrarily set an end of 1500 which still stands as a convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glomski|first1=J|title=Incunabula Typographiae: seventeenth-century views on early printing|journal=The Library|volume=2|pages=336|year=2001|doi=10.1093/library/2.4.336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only by a misunderstanding was [[Bernhard von Mallinckrodt]] (1591–1664) considered to be the inventor of this meaning of ''incunabula''; the identical passage is found in his Latin pamphlet ''De ortu ac progressu artis typographicae'' ("On the rise and progress of the typographic art", [[Cologne]], 1640): Bernardus a Mallinkrot, ''De ortu ac progressu artis typographicae dissertatio historica'', [...], Coloniae Agrippinae, apud Ioannem Kinchium, '''1640''' (in frontispiece: 1639), p. 29 l. 16: «inter prima artis [typographicae] '''incunabula'''», within a long passage of several pages, which he (correctly) quotes entirely in italic characters (that is between quotation marks), referring to the name of author and work cited: «Primus istorum [...] Hadrianus Iunius est, cuius integrum locum, ex ''Batavia'' eius, operae pretium est adscribere; [...]. Ita igitur Iunius» (ibid., p. 27 ll. 27-32, followed by the long passage, «Redeo → sordes», ibid., p. 27, l. 32 – p. 33 l. 32 [= ''Batavia'', p. 253 l. 28 – p. 258 l. 21]). So the source is only one, the other is a quotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Le baptême inconscient de l'incunable: non pas 1640 mais 1569 au plus tard|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00791398v2|journal=Gutenberg Jahrbuch|volume=84|pages=102–105|language=French|doi=|last1=Sordet|first1=Yann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''incunabula'' came to denote the printed books themselves in the late 17th century. [[John Evelyn]], in moving the [[Arundel Manuscripts]] to the [[Royal Society]] in August 1678, remarked of the printed books among the manuscripts: "The printed books, being of the oldest impressions, are not the less valuable; I esteem them almost equal to MSS."&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn, ''The Diary of John Evelyn From 1641 to 1705/6''.&lt;/ref&gt; The convenient but arbitrarily chosen end date for identifying a printed book as an incunable does not reflect any notable developments in the printing process, and many books printed for a number of years after 1500 continued to be visually indistinguishable from incunables.  

'''"Post-incunable"''' typically refers to books printed after 1500 up to another arbitrary end date such as 1520 or 1540. From around this period the dating of any edition becomes easier, as the practice of printers including information such as the place and year of printing became more widespread.

==Types==
There are two types of ''incunabula'' in printing: the [[block book]], printed from a single carved or sculpted wooden block for each page, employing the same process as the [[woodcut]] in art (these may be called ''xylographic''); and the ''[[Typography|typographic book]]'', made with individual pieces of cast-metal [[movable type]] on a [[printing press]]. Many authors reserve the term ''incunabula'' for the latter kind only.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to the Book'', ed. M. F. Suarez and H. R. Woudhuysen, OUP, 2010, s.v. 'Incunabulum', p. 815.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of [[printing]] to cities both in the north and in Italy ensured that there was great variety in the texts chosen for printing and the styles in which they appeared. Many early [[typeface]]s were modelled on local forms of [[writing]] or derived from the various European forms of [[Blackletter|Gothic]] script, but there were also some derived from documentary scripts (such as most of [[William Caxton|Caxton]]'s types), and, particularly in Italy, types modelled on handwritten scripts and [[calligraphy]] employed by [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]].

Printers congregated in urban centres where there were [[scholar]]s, [[ecclesiastic]]s, [[lawyers]], and [[nobles]] and [[profession]]als who formed their major customer base. Standard works in [[Latin]] inherited from the medieval tradition formed the bulk of the earliest printed works, but as books became cheaper, [[vernacular]] works (or translations into vernaculars of standard works) began to appear.

==Famous examples==
[[File:Pfister.faks.1.jpg|thumb|left|240px|First incunable with illustrations, Ulrich Boner's ''Der Edelstein,'' printed by Albrecht Pfister, Bamberg, 1461]]
The most famous ''incunabula'' include two from [[Mainz]], the [[Gutenberg Bible]] of 1455 and the ''[[Peregrinatio in terram sanctam]]'' of 1486, printed and illustrated by [[Erhard Reuwich]]; the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' written by [[Hartmann Schedel]] and printed by [[Anton Koberger]] in 1493; and the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' printed by [[Aldus Manutius]] with important illustrations by an unknown artist. 

Other printers of incunabula were [[Günther Zainer]] of [[Augsburg]], [[Johannes Mentelin]] and [[Heinrich Eggestein]] of [[Strasbourg]], [[Heinrich Gran]] of [[Haguenau]] and [[William Caxton]] of [[Bruges]] and [[London]]. The first incunable to have woodcut illustrations was [[Ulrich Boner]]'s ''Der Edelstein'', printed by [[Albrecht Pfister]] in [[Bamberg]] in 1461.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel De Simone (ed), ''A Heavenly Craft: the Woodcut in Early Printed Books,'' New York, 2004, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-incunable ==
Many incunabula are undated, needing complex bibliographical analysis to place them correctly. The post-incunabula period marks a time of development during which the printed book evolved fully as a mature artefact with a standard format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |title=The Book Triumphant: Print in Transition in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries |editor1-last=Walsby |editor1-first=Malcolm |editor2-last=Kemp |editor2-first=Graeme |publisher=Brill |year=2011 |page=viii |isbn=9789004207233 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cysqnfvAUEAC&amp;pg=PR7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After c. 1540 books tended to conform to a template that included the author, title-page, date, seller, and place of printing. This makes it much easier to identify any particular edition.{{sfn|Walsby|Kemp|2011|p=viii}}

As noted above, the ''end date'' for identifying a printed book as an incunable is convenient but was chosen arbitrarily; it does not reflect any notable developments in the printing process around the year 1500. Books printed for a number of years after 1500 continued to look much like incunables, with the notable exception of the small format books printed in [[italic type]] introduced by [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1501. The term '''post-incunable''' is sometimes used to refer to books printed "after 1500—how long after, the experts have not yet agreed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv| |first=John |last=Carter |first2=Nicolas |last2=Barker |title=ABC for Book Collectors |url=http://www.ilab.org/download.php?object=documentation&amp;id=29 |format=PDF |accessdate=28 May 2010 |edition=8th |year=2004 |publisher=Oak Knoll Press and the British Library |location=New Castle, Del. |isbn=1-58456-112-2 |page=172}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; For books printed in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the term generally covers 1501–1520, and for books printed in mainland [[Europe]], 1501–1540.{{sfn|Carter|Barker|2004|p=172}}

The 18 languages that incunabula are printed in, in descending order, are: Latin, [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], English, [[Hebrew]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Church Slavonic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (see diagram).

Only about one edition in ten (i.e. just over 3,000) has any illustrations, [[woodcut]]s or [[metalcut]]s.

The "commonest" incunable is Schedel's ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' ("Liber Chronicarum") of 1493, with c 1,250 surviving copies (which is also the most heavily illustrated). Many incunabula are unique, but on average about 18 copies survive of each. This makes the [[Gutenberg Bible]], at 48 or 49 known copies, a relatively common (though extremely valuable) edition. Counting extant incunabula is complicated by the fact that most libraries consider a single volume of a multi-volume work as a separate item, as well as fragments or copies lacking more than half the total leaves. A complete incunable may consist of a slip, or up to ten volumes.

In terms of [[Book size|format]], the 29,000-odd editions comprise: 2,000 [[broadside (printing)|broadsides]], 9,000 [[Folio (printing)|folios]], 15,000 [[quarto]]s, 3,000 [[octavo]]s, 18 [[Book size|12mos]], 230 [[Book size|16mos]], 20 [[Book size|32mos]], and 3 [[Book size|64mos]].

ISTC at present cites 528 extant copies of books printed by [[William Caxton|Caxton]], which together with 128 fragments makes 656 in total, though many are broadsides or very imperfect (incomplete).

Apart from migration to mainly North American and Japanese universities, there has been little movement of incunabula in the last five centuries. None were printed in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the latter appears to possess less than 2,000 copies, about 97.75% remain north of the equator. However many incunabula are sold at auction or through the rare book trade every year.

==Major collections==
The [[British Library]]'s [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]] now records over 29,000 titles, of which around 27,400 are incunabula editions (not all unique works). Studies of incunabula began in the 17th century. [[Michel Maittaire]] (1667–1747) and [[Georg Wolfgang Panzer]] (1729–1805) arranged printed material chronologically in annals format, and in the first half of the 19th century, [[Ludwig Hain]] published, ''Repertorium bibliographicum''— a checklist of incunabula arranged alphabetically by author: "Hain numbers" are still a reference point. Hain was expanded in subsequent editions, by [[Walter A. Copinger]] and [[Dietrich Reichling]], but it is being superseded by the authoritative modern listing, a German catalogue, the ''[[Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke]]'', which has been under way since 1925 and is still being compiled at the [[Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin]]. North American holdings were listed by [[Frederick R. Goff]] and a worldwide union catalogue is provided by the [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/|title=ISTC|accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National law may become international law when [[treaties]] permit national jurisdiction to [[supranational]] tribunals such as the [[European Court of Human Rights]] or the [[International Criminal Court]]. Treaties such as the [[Geneva Conventions]] may require national law to conform to respective parts.

International law is consent-based governance. This means that a state member may choose to not abide by international law, and even to break its treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slomanson|first=William|title=Fundamental Perspectives on International Law|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston, USA|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an issue of [[state sovereignty]].  International laws are consent-based. Violations of [[customary international law]] and peremptory norms (''[[Peremptory norm|jus cogens]]'') can lead to wars.

(Jr.)|title=How The Catholic Church Built Western Civilization|year=2005|publisher=Regnery Publishing|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-89526-038-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The current order of international law, the equality of sovereignty between nations, was formed through the conclusion of the "[[Peace of Westphalia]]" in 1648.  Prior to 1648, on the basis of the purpose of war or the legitimacy of war, it sought to distinguish whether the war was a "just war" or not. This theory of power interruptions can also be found in the writings of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Cicero]] and the writings of St. Augustine. According to the theory of armistice, the nation that caused unwarranted war could not enjoy the right to obtain or conquer trophies that were legitimate at the time &lt;ref&gt;Randall Lesaffer, “Too Much History: from War as Sanction to the Sanctioning of War”, in Marc Weller (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p.37-38&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th, 18th and 19th centuries saw the growth of the concept of the sovereign "[[nation-state]]", which consisted of a nation controlled by a centralised system of government.  The concept of [[nationalism]] became increasingly important as people began to see themselves as citizens of a particular nation with a distinct national identity.  Until the mid-19th century, relations between nation-states were dictated by treaty, agreements to behave in a certain way towards another state, unenforceable except by force, and not binding except as matters of honor and faithfulness. But treaties alone became increasingly toothless and wars became increasingly destructive, most markedly towards civilians, who decried their horrors, leading to calls for regulation of the acts of states, especially in times of war.

The modern study of international law starts in the early 19th century, but its origins go back at least to the 16th century, and [[Alberico Gentili]], [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and [[Hugo Grotius]], the "fathers of international law."&lt;ref name="Jr.2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Woods Jr.|title=How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYvmAgAAQBAJ|date=18 September 2012|publisher=Regnery Publishing, Incorporated, An Eagle Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-59698-328-1|pages=5, 141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several legal systems developed in [[Europe]], including the codified systems of continental European states and [[English common law]], based on decisions by judges and not by written codes. Other areas developed differing legal systems, with the Chinese legal tradition dating back more than four thousand years, although at the end of the 19th century, there was still no written code for civil proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''China and Her People'', [[Charles Harvey Denby|Charles Denby]], L. C. Page, Boston 1906 page 203&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first instruments of modern international law was the [[Lieber Code]], passed in 1863 by the [[Congress of the United States]], to govern the conduct of US forces during the [[United States Civil War]] and considered to be the first written recitation of the rules and articles of war, adhered to by all civilised nations, the precursor of international law. This led to the first prosecution for war crimes—in the case of United States prisoners of war held in cruel and depraved conditions at [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville]], Georgia, in which the Confederate commandant of that camp was tried and hanged, the only Confederate soldier to be punished by death in the aftermath of the entire [[United States Civil War|Civil War]].

In the years that followed, other states subscribed to limitations of their conduct, and numerous other treaties and bodies were created to regulate the conduct of states towards one another in terms of these treaties, including, but not limited to, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in 1899; the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague]] and [[Geneva Conventions]], the first of which was passed in 1864; the [[International Court of Justice]] in 1921; the [[Genocide Convention]]; and the [[International Criminal Court]], in the late 1990s. Because international law is a relatively new area of law its development and propriety in applicable areas are often subject to dispute.

== International relations ==
{{Main|Sources of international law|List of ICJ cases}}
Under article 38 of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]], international law has three principal sources: international treaties, custom, and general principles of law. In addition, judicial decisions and teachings may be applied as "subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law",

International treaty law comprises obligations states expressly and voluntarily accept between themselves in [[treaty|treaties]]. Customary international law is derived from the consistent practice of States accompanied by ''[[opinio juris]]'', i.e. the conviction of States that the consistent practice is required by a legal obligation. Judgments of international tribunals as well as scholarly works have traditionally been looked to as persuasive sources for custom in addition to direct evidence of state behavior. Attempts to codify customary international law picked up momentum after the [[Second World War]] with the formation of the [[International Law Commission]] (ILC), under the aegis of the [[United Nations]]. Codified customary law is made the binding interpretation of the underlying custom by agreement through treaty. For states not party to such treaties, the work of the ILC may still be accepted as custom applying to those states. General principles of law are those commonly recognized by the major legal systems of the world. Certain norms of international law achieve the binding force of [[peremptory norm]]s (''jus cogens'') as to include all states with no permissible derogations.

*''[[Colombia v Perú]]'' [1950] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1950/6.html ICJ 6], recognising custom as a source of international law, but a practice of giving asylum was not part of it.
*''[[Belgium v Spain]]'' [1970] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1970/1.html ICJ 1], only the state where a corporation is incorporated (not where its major shareholders reside) has standing to bring an action for damages for economic loss.

International law is sourced from decision makers and researchers looking to verify the substantive legal rule governing a legal dispute or academic discourse. The [[sources of international law]] applied by the community of nations to find the content of international law are listed under Article 38.1 of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]]: [[Treaties]], customs, and general principles are stated as the three primary sources; and judicial decisions and scholarly writings are expressly designated as the subsidiary sources of international law. Many scholars agree that the fact that the sources are arranged sequentially in the Article 38 of the ICJ Statute suggests an implicit hierarchy of sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slomanson|first=William|title=Fundamental Perspectives on International Law|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston, USA|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no concrete evidence, in the decisions of the international courts and tribunals, to support such strict hierarchy, at least when it is about choosing international customs and treaties. In addition, unlike the Article 21 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], which clearly defines hierarchy of applicable law (or sources of international law), the language of the Article 38 do not explicitly support hierarchy of sources.

The sources have been influenced by a range of political and legal theories. During the 20th century, it was recognized by legal [[legal positivism|positivists]] that a [[sovereign state]] could limit its authority to act by consenting to an agreement according to the principle ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]''. This consensual view of international law was reflected in the 1920 Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, which was succeeded by the [[United Nations Charter]] and is preserved in the [[United Nations]] Article 7 of the 1946 Statute of the International Court of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml ''Charter of the United Nations''], United Nations, 24 October 1945, 1 UNTS, XVI&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treaties ===
Where there are disputes about the exact meaning and application of national laws, it is the responsibility of the courts to decide what the law means. In international law interpretation is within the domain of the protagonists, but may also be conferred on judicial bodies such as the International Court of Justice, by the terms of the treaties or by consent of the parties. It is generally the responsibility of states to interpret the law for themselves, but the processes of diplomacy and availability of supra-national judicial organs operate routinely to provide assistance to that end.
Insofar as treaties are concerned, the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] writes on the topic of interpretation that:
: "A treaty shall be interpreted in [[good faith]] in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose." (article 31(1))
This is actually a compromise between three different theories of interpretation:
* The textual approach, a restrictive interpretation, which bases itself on the "ordinary meaning" of the text; that approach assigns considerable weight to the actual text.
* The subjective approach, which takes into consideration i. the idea behind the treaty, ii. treaties "in their context", and iii. what the writers intended when they wrote the text.
* A third approach, which bases itself on interpretation "in the light of its object and purpose", i.e. the interpretation that best suits the goal of the treaty, also called "effective interpretation".
These are general rules of interpretation; specific rules might exist in specific areas of international law.

*''[[Greece v United Kingdom]]'' [1952] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1952/1.html ICJ 1], ICJ had no jurisdiction to hear a dispute between the UK government and a private Greek businessman under the terms of a treaty.
*''[[United Kingdom v Iran]]'' [1952] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1952/2.html ICJ 2], the ICJ did not have jurisdiction for a dispute over the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.]] being nationalised.
*''[[Oil Platforms case (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)]]'' [2003] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/2003/4.html ICJ 4], rejected dispute over damage to ships which hit a mine.

=== Statehood and responsibility ===
{{See also|Monism and dualism in international law}}
International law establishes the framework and the criteria for identifying [[Sovereign state|states]] as the principal actors in the international legal system. As the existence of a state presupposes control and [[jurisdiction]] over territory, international law deals with the acquisition of territory, [[state immunity]] and the legal responsibility of states in their conduct with each other. International law is similarly concerned with the treatment of individuals within state boundaries. There is thus a comprehensive regime dealing with group rights, the treatment of [[alien (law)|aliens]], the rights of [[refugee]]s, [[Transnational crime|international crimes]], [[nationality]] problems, and [[human rights]] generally. It further includes the important functions of the maintenance of international peace and security, arms control, the pacific settlement of disputes and the regulation of the [[use of force]] in international relations. Even when the law is not able to stop the outbreak of war, it has developed principles to govern the conduct of hostilities and the treatment of [[prisoners of war|prisoners]]. International law is also used to govern issues relating to the global environment, the global commons such as [[international waters]] and [[outer space]], global communications, and [[International trade|world trade]].

In theory all states are [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and equal. As a result of the notion of sovereignty, the value and authority of international law is dependent upon the voluntary participation of states in its formulation, observance, and enforcement. Although there may be exceptions, it is thought by many international academics that most states enter into legal commitments with other states out of [[enlightened self-interest]] rather than adherence to a body of law that is higher than their own. As [[D. W. Greig]] notes, "international law cannot exist in isolation from the political factors operating in the sphere of [[international relations]]".&lt;ref&gt;Greig, D. W., ''International Law'', 2nd edn (Butterworths: London, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, [[sovereign state]]s and the [[Holy See#Status of the Holy See in international law|Holy See]] were the sole subjects of international law. With the proliferation of [[international organizations]] over the last century, they have in some cases been recognized as relevant parties as well. Recent interpretations of [[international human rights law]], [[international humanitarian law]], and [[international trade law]] (e.g., [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) Chapter 11 actions) have been inclusive of corporations, and even of certain individuals.

The conflict between international law and national sovereignty is subject to vigorous debate and dispute in academia, diplomacy, and politics. Certainly, there is a growing trend toward judging a state's domestic actions in the light of international law and standards. Numerous people now view the nation-state as the primary unit of international affairs, and believe that only states may choose to voluntarily enter into commitments under international law, and that they have the right to follow their own counsel when it comes to interpretation of their commitments. Certain scholars{{who|date=August 2012}} and political leaders feel that these modern developments endanger nation states by taking power away from state governments and ceding it to international bodies such as the U.N. and the World Bank, argue that international law has evolved to a point where it exists separately from the mere consent of states, and discern a legislative and judicial process to international law that parallels such processes within domestic law.  This especially occurs when states violate or deviate from the expected standards of conduct adhered to by all civilized nations.

A number of states place emphasis on the principle of territorial sovereignty, thus seeing states as having free rein over their internal affairs. Other states oppose this view. One group of opponents of this point of view, including many [[Europe]]an nations, maintain that all civilized nations have certain norms of conduct expected of them, including the prohibition of [[genocide]], [[slavery]] and the [[slave trade]], [[war of aggression|wars of aggression]], [[torture]], and [[piracy]], and that violation of these universal norms represents a crime, not only against the individual victims, but against humanity as a whole. States and individuals who subscribe to this view opine that, in the case of the individual responsible for violation of international law, he "is become, like the [[piracy|pirate]] and the [[slave trade]]r before him, [[hostis humani generis]], an enemy of all mankind",&lt;ref&gt;Janis, M. and Noyes, J. International Law": Cases and Commentary (3rd ed.), Prosecutor v. Furundžija, Page 148 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and thus subject to prosecution in a fair trial before any fundamentally just tribunal, through the exercise of [[universal jurisdiction]].

Though the European democracies tend to support broad, universalistic interpretations of international law, many other democracies have differing views on international law. Several democracies, including [[India]], [[Israel]] and the [[United States]], take a flexible, eclectic approach, recognizing aspects of international law such as territorial rights as universal, regarding other aspects as arising from treaty or custom, and viewing certain aspects as not being subjects of international law at all. Democracies in the developing world, due to their past colonial histories, often insist on non-interference in their internal affairs, particularly regarding human rights standards or their peculiar institutions, but often strongly support international law at the bilateral and multilateral levels, such as in the United Nations, and especially regarding the use of force, disarmament obligations, and the terms of the UN Charter.

{{quote| It is probably the case that almost all nations observe almost all principles of international law and almost all of their obligations almost all the time.|[[Louis Henkin]]&lt;ref name="Henkin Quote"&gt;{{cite book|last=Henkin|first=Louis|title=How Nations Behave|year=1968|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since international law has no established compulsory [[judicial system]] for the settlement of disputes or a coercive [[penal system]], it is not as straightforward as managing breaches within a domestic legal system. However, there are means by which breaches are brought to the attention of the international community and some means for resolution. For example, there are judicial or quasi-judicial tribunals in international law in certain areas such as trade and human rights. The formation of the [[United Nations]], for example, created a means for the world community to enforce international law upon members that violate its charter through the Security Council.

Since international law exists in a legal environment without an overarching "sovereign" (i.e., an external power able and willing to compel compliance with international norms), "enforcement" of international law is very different from in the domestic context. In many cases, enforcement takes on [[Ronald Coase|Coasian]] characteristics, where the norm is self-enforcing.  In other cases, defection from the norm can pose a real risk, particularly if the international environment is changing.  When this happens, and if enough states (or enough powerful states) continually ignore a particular aspect of international law, the norm may actually change according to concepts of customary international law.  For example, prior to World War I, [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] was considered a violation of international law and ostensibly the [[casus belli]] for the United States' declaration of war against Germany.  By World War II, however, the practice was so widespread that during the [[Nuremberg trials]], the charges against German Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] for ordering unrestricted submarine warfare were dropped, notwithstanding that the activity constituted a clear violation of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936.

=== Domestic enforcement ===
Apart from a state's natural inclination to uphold certain norms, the force of international law comes from the pressure that states put upon one another to behave consistently and to honor their obligations. As with any system of law, many violations of international law obligations are overlooked. If addressed, it may be through [[diplomacy]] and the consequences upon an offending state's reputation, submission to international judicial determination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php|title=Home – International Court of Justice|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;k=cd&amp;case=1|title=Contentious Cases – International Court of Justice|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; arbitration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2194880|title=Arbitral Opinion Relative to the Gold of the National Bank of Albania|date=1 January 1955|journal=The American Journal of International Law|volume=49|issue=3|pages=403–405|doi=10.2307/2194880}}&lt;/ref&gt; sanctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/syria.aspx|title=Syria Sanctions|website=Treasury.gov|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or force including war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklandswar.org.uk|title=The Falklands Conflict|website=Falkslandswar.org.uk|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though violations may be common in fact, states try to avoid the appearance of having disregarded international obligations. States may also unilaterally adopt sanctions against one another such as the severance of economic or diplomatic ties, or through reciprocal action. In some cases, domestic courts may render judgment against a foreign state (the realm of private international law) for an injury, though this is a complicated area of law where international law intersects with domestic law.

It is implicit in the Westphalian system of nation-states, and explicitly recognized under Article 51 of the [[Charter of the United Nations]], that all states have the inherent right to individual and collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against them. Article 51 of the UN Charter guarantees the right of states to defend themselves until (and unless) the Security Council takes measures to keep the peace.

===International bodies===
{{Main|International legal system|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377}}
As a "deliberative, policymaking and representative organ", the [[United Nations General Assembly]] "is empowered to make recommendations"; it can neither codify international law nor make binding resolutions.&lt;ref name="UN_GA-Powers"&gt;{{cite web |title=Functions and powers of the General Assembly |url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/about/background.shtml |website=un.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_Int-Law"&gt;{{cite web |title=International Law and Justice |url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/international-law-and-justice/index.html |website=un.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=5 October 2018|date=2016-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merely internal resolutions, such as budgetary matters, may be binding on the operation of the General Assembly itself. Violations of the UN Charter by members of the United Nations may be raised by the aggrieved state in the General Assembly for debate. 

[[United Nations General Assembly resolution|General Assembly resolution]]s are generally non-binding towards member states, but through its adoption of the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|"Uniting for Peace" resolution (A/RES/377 A)]], of 3 November 1950, the Assembly declared that it had the power to authorize the use of force, under the terms of the UN Charter, in cases of breaches of the peace or acts of aggression, provided that the Security Council, owing to the negative vote of a permanent member, fails to act to address the situation. The Assembly also declared, by its adoption of [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|resolution 377 A]], that it could call for other collective measures—such as economic and diplomatic sanctions—in situations constituting the milder "threat to the Peace". 

The Uniting for Peace resolution was initiated by the United States in 1950, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], as a means of circumventing possible future Soviet vetoes in the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. The legal role of the resolution is clear, given that the General Assembly can neighter issue binding resolutions nor codify law. It was never argued by the "Joint Seven-Powers" that put forward the draft resolution,&lt;ref&gt;United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Turkey, Philippines and Uruguay&lt;/ref&gt; during the corresponding discussions, that it in any way afforded the Assembly new powers. Instead, they argued that the resolution simply declared what the Assembly's powers already were, according to the UN Charter, in the case of a dead-locked Security Council.&lt;ref name="UN_APV299"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-PV.299 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=1 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_APV300"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-PV.300 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=2 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_APV301"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-PV.301 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=2 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_APV302"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-PV.302 |type=Proces Verbal |body=General Assembly |session=5 |year=1950 |date=3 November 1950 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union was the only permanent member of the Security Council to vote against the Charter interpretations that were made recommendation by the Assembly's adoption of resolution 377 A.

Alleged violations of the Charter can also be raised by states in the Security Council. The Security Council could subsequently pass resolutions under Chapter VI of the UN Charter to recommend the "Pacific Resolution of Disputes." Such resolutions are not binding under international law, though they usually are expressive of the Council's convictions.  In rare cases, the Security Council can adopt resolutions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, related to "threats to Peace, Breaches of the Peace and Acts of Aggression," which are legally binding under international law, and can be followed up with economic sanctions, military action, and similar uses of force through the auspices of the United Nations.

It has been argued that resolutions passed outside of Chapter VII can also be binding; the legal basis for that is the Council's broad powers under Article 24(2), which states that "in discharging these duties (exercise of primary responsibility in international peace and security), it shall act in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations". The mandatory nature of such resolutions was upheld by the [[International Court of Justice]]  (ICJ) in its advisory opinion on [[Namibia]]. The binding nature of such resolutions can be deduced from an interpretation of their language and intent.

States can also, upon mutual consent, submit disputes for arbitration by the [[International Court of Justice]], located in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. The judgments given by the Court in these cases are binding, although it possesses no means to enforce its rulings.
The Court may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request. Some of the advisory cases brought before the court have been controversial with respect to the court's competence and jurisdiction.

Often enormously complicated matters, ICJ cases (of which there have been less than 150 since the court was created from the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] in 1945) can stretch on for years and generally involve thousands of pages of pleadings, evidence, and the world's leading specialist international lawyers. As of June 2009, there are 15 cases pending at the ICJ. Decisions made through other means of arbitration may be binding or non-binding depending on the nature of the arbitration agreement, whereas decisions resulting from contentious cases argued before the ICJ are always binding on the involved states.

Though states (or increasingly, [[international organizations]]) are usually the only ones with standing to address a violation of international law, some treaties, such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] have an optional [[Protocol (treaty)|protocol]] that allows individuals who have had their rights violated by member states to petition the international [[Human Rights Committee]]. Investment treaties commonly and routinely provide for enforcement by individuals or investing entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://archive.is/20120712220742/http://finlayson.id.au/index.php/practising-law/australia-indonesia-agreements/ | title=Australia Indonesia Treaties}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commercial agreements of foreigners with sovereign governments may be enforced on the international plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/australia/article.asp?articleid=12836|title=The Sandline Affair Illegality And International Law* - International Law – Australia|website=Mondaq.com|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International courts===
There are numerous international bodies created by treaties adjudicating on legal issues where they may have jurisdiction. The only one claiming [[universal jurisdiction]] is the [[United Nations Security Council]]. Others are: the United Nations [[International Court of Justice]], and the [[International Criminal Court]] (when national systems have totally failed and the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Treaty of Rome]] is applicable) and the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]].

===East Africa Community===
{{Main|East African Community}}
There were ambitions to make the East African Community, consisting of [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Burundi]] and [[Rwanda]], a political federation with its own form of binding supranational law, but this effort has not materialized.

===Union of South American Nations===
{{Main|Union of South American Nations}}
The Union of South American Nations serves the South American continent. It intends to establish a framework akin to the [[European Union]] by the end of 2019. It is envisaged to have its own passport and currency, and limit barriers to trade.

===Andean Community of Nations===
{{Main|Andean Community of Nations}}
The Andean Community of Nations is the first attempt to integrate the countries of the [[Andes Mountains]] in South America. It started with the Cartagena Agreement of 26 May 1969, and consists of four countries: [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]. The Andean Community follows supranational laws, called Agreements, which are mandatory for these countries.

==International legal theory==
{{Main|International legal theories}}
International legal theory comprises a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches used to explain and analyse the content, formation and effectiveness of international law and institutions and to suggest improvements. Some approaches center on the question of compliance: why states follow international norms in the absence of a coercitive power that ensures compliance. Other approaches focus on the problem of the formation of international rules: why states voluntarily adopt international law norms, that limit their freedom of action, in the absence of a world legislature; while other perspectives are policy oriented: they elaborate theoretical frameworks and instruments to criticize the existing norms and to make suggestions on how to improve them. Some of these approaches are based on domestic [[legal theory]], some are [[interdisciplinary]], and others have been developed expressly to analyse international law. Classical approaches to International legal theory are the [[Natural law]], the Eclectic and the [[Legal positivism]] schools of thought.

The [[natural law]] approach argues that international norms should be based on [[axiomatic]] truths. 16th-century natural law writer, [[Francisco de Vitoria]], a professor of [[theology]] at the [[University of Salamanca]], examined the questions of the [[just war]], the Spanish authority in the [[Americas]], and the rights of the Native American peoples.

In 1625 [[Hugo Grotius]] argued that nations as well as persons ought to be governed by universal principle based on [[morality]] and [[Divine retribution|divine justice]] while the relations among polities ought to be governed by the law of peoples, the ''[[jus gentium]]'', established by the consent of the community of nations on the basis of the principle of ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'', that is, on the basis of the observance of commitments. On his part, [[Emmerich de Vattel]] argued instead for the equality of states as articulated by 18th-century natural law and suggested that the law of nations was composed of custom and law on the one hand, and natural law on the other. During the 17th century, the basic tenets of the Grotian or [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] school, especially the doctrines of legal equality, territorial sovereignty, and independence of states, became the fundamental principles of the European political and legal system and were enshrined in the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]].

The early [[legal positivism|positivist]] school emphasized the importance of custom and treaties as sources of international law. 16th-century [[Alberico Gentili]] used historical examples to posit that positive law (''jus voluntarium'') was determined by general consent. [[Cornelius van Bynkershoek]] asserted that the bases of international law were customs and treaties commonly consented to by various states, while [[John Jacob Moser]] emphasized the importance of state practice in international law. The positivism school narrowed the range of international practice that might qualify as law, favouring [[rationality]] over [[morality]] and [[ethic]]s. The 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]] marked the formal recognition of the political and international legal system based on the conditions of Europe.

Modern legal positivists consider international law as a unified system of rules that emanates from the states' will. International law, as it is, is an "[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]" reality that needs to be distinguished from law "as it should be." Classic positivism demands rigorous tests for [[law|legal]] [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and it deems irrelevant all extralegal arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Simma]] and Andreas L.Paulus "Symposium on method in International Law: The Responsibility of Individuals for Human Rights Abuses in Internal Conflicts: A Positivist View" 93 American Journal of International Law 302  (April, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
The term "international law" is sometimes divided into "public" and "private" international law, particularly by civil law scholars, who seek to follow a Roman tradition.&lt;ref&gt;There is an ongoing debate on the relationship between different branches of international law. {{cite journal|last1=Koskenniemi|first1=Marti|title=Fragmentation of International Law? Postmodern Anxieties|journal=Leiden Journal of International Law|date=September 2002|volume=15|issue=3|pages=553–579|doi=10.1017/S0922156502000262|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0922156502000262|accessdate=30 January 2015}} {{cite journal|last1=Yun|first1=Seira|title=Breaking Imaginary Barriers: Obligations of Armed Non-State Actors Under General Human Rights Law – The Case of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child|journal=Journal of International Humanitarian Legal Studies|date=2014|volume=5|issue=1–2|pages=213–257|ssrn=2556825|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman lawyers would have further distinguished ''[[jus gentium]]'', the law of nations, and ''[[jus inter gentes]]'' – agreements between nations. On this view, "public" international law is said to cover relations between nation-states, and includes fields such as [[treaty law]], [[law of sea]], [[international criminal law]], the [[laws of war]] or [[international humanitarian law]], [[international human rights law]], and [[refugee law]]. By contrast "private" international law, which is more commonly termed "[[conflict of laws]]", concerns whether courts within countries claim jurisdiction over cases with a foreign element, and which country's law applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/en/sla/dil/private_international_law.asp| title=Private International Law|website=Oas.org|accessdate=27 December 2017| date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further concept, more recently developing, is of "[[supranational law]]", on the law of [[supranational]] organizations. This concerns regional agreements where the laws of nation states may be held inapplicable when conflicting with a supranational legal system when that nation has a [[treaty]] obligation to a supranational [[collective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/883/the-sovereignty-of-the-european-court-of-justice-and-the-eus-supranational-legal-system|author=Kolcak, Hakan|title=The Sovereignty of the European Court of Justice and the EU's Supranational Legal System|website=Inquiriesjournal.com|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems of "supranational law" arise when nations explicitly cede their right to make certain judicial decisions to a common tribunal.&lt;ref name="Degan1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Degan|first=Vladimir Đuro|title=Sources of International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0pTp1qCc9UC&amp;pg=PA126|accessdate=5 December 2015|date=1997-05-21|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9789041104212|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decisions of the common tribunal are directly effective in each party nation, and have priority over decisions taken by national courts.&lt;ref name="Blanpain2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blanpain|first=Roger|title=Comparative Labour Law and Industrial Relations in Industrialized Market Economies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ahaoKRbqPdMC&amp;pg=PA410|accessdate=5 December 2015|year=2010|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9789041133489|pages=410 n.61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] is an example of an international treaty organization which implements a supranational legal framework, with the [[European Court of Justice]] having supremacy over all member-nation courts in matter of [[European Union law]]. A further frequently used term is "transnational law", which refers to a body of rules that transcend the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cotterrell|first=Roger|date=2012-03-01|title=What Is Transnational Law?|journal=Law &amp; Social Inquiry|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=500–524|doi=10.1111/j.1747-4469.2012.01306.x|issn=1747-4469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Nation-states observe the principle of {{lang-la|[[par in parem non habet imperium]]|lit=Between equals there is no sovereign power|label=none}}. [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]] therefore asserted that 'so-called' international law, lacking a sovereign power and so unenforceable, was not really law at all, but 'positive morality', consisting of 'opinions and sentiments...more ethical than legal in nature.' &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;James B Scott, "The legal nature of international law", ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', vol 5 no 2, Feb 1905, p 128-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 2 (1) of the [[UN Charter]] confirms this Sovereignty of Nations; no state is in subjection to any other state.

Also, since the bulk of international law is treaty law, binding only on signatories, then; &lt;blockquote&gt; 'If legislation is the making of laws by a person or assembly  binding on the whole community, there is no such thing as international law. For treaties bind only those who sign them.' &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since states are few in number, diverse and atypical in character, unindictable, lacking a centralised sovereign power, and their agreements unpoliced and decentralised,&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Wight, power politics, p 109&lt;/ref&gt; then, says Wight, 'international society is not a society at all. The condition of international relations is best described as international anarchy;
&lt;blockquote&gt; 'While in domestic politics the struggle for power is governed and circumscribed by law, in international politics, law is governed and circumscribed by the struggle for power. (This is why) international politics is called [[power politics]]... War is the only means by which states can in the last resort defend vital interests...the causes of war are inherent in power politics.' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the subject of treaty law, [[Charles de Gaulle]] said this; 'Treaties are like pretty girls, or roses; they last only as long as they last.' &lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;speech, 2/7/1963; [[Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]], OUP 1999, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Hans Morgenthau]], international law is the weakest and most primitive system of law enforcement. Its decentralised nature makes it similar to the law that prevails in preliterate tribal societies.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Morgenthau, Politics among nations, fifth edition, Knopf, 1976, p273&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Monopoly on violence]] is what makes domestic law enforceable; but between nations, there are multiple competing sources of force.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;ibid, p273-4&lt;/ref&gt; The confusion created by treaty laws, which resemble private contracts between persons, is mitigated only by the relatively small number of states.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;ibid, p 275&lt;/ref&gt; On the vital subject of war, it is unclear whether the [[Nuremberg trials]] created new law, or applied the existing law of the [[Kellogg-Briand pact]].

Morgenthau asserts that no state may be compelled to submit a dispute to an international tribunal, making laws unenforceable and voluntary.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;ibid, p281&lt;/ref&gt; International law is also unpoliced, lacking agencies for enforcement.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;ibid, p 289&lt;/ref&gt; He cites a 1947 US opinion poll in which 75% of respondents wanted 'an international police to maintain world peace'; but only 13% wanted that force to exceed the US armed forces. Later surveys have produced similar contradictory results.&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;ibid, p 324&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language delay''' is a failure in [[children]] to develop [[language]] abilities on the usual [[age-appropriate]] for their [[developmental timetable]]. It is most common during the ages of 2 to 7 years and can sometimes continue into late childhood.  Language delay is distinct from [[speech delay]], in which the development of the [[Manner of articulation|mechanical and motor aspects of speech production]] is delayed.

Communication is a two-stage process.  The first stage is to encode the message into a set of words (or signs in the case of Sign Languages) and sentence structures that convey the required meaning, i.e. into language. In the second stage, language is translated into motor commands that control the articulators (hands, face, body, lungs, vocal cords, mouth, tongue, teeth, etc.), thereby creating language.

Because language and speech are independent, they may be individually delayed. For example, a child may be delayed in speech
(i.e., unable to produce intelligible speech sounds), but not delayed in language because they use a Sign Language or other means of communication.

{{anchor|receptive|expressive}}Language delay is commonly divided into ''receptive'' and ''expressive'' categories. [[Receptive language]] refers to the process of understanding language.  [[Expressive language]] refers to the use of sentences (made of words or signs) to communicate messages to others.  Both categories are essential to effective communication.

==Presentation==
===Complications===
Language delay is a [[risk factor]] for other types of developmental delay, including social, emotional, and cognitive delay. Even though speech and language delays may affect a smaller portion of the population in children, it still can have an incredible impact on their life and their accomplishments in the future. Some of these include problems with behavior, difficulty with reading, and other issues related to spelling and low IQ scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Screening for speech and language delay in preschool children: Recommendation statement|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/speech-and-language-delay-in-preschool-children-screening|journal=Pediatrics|volume=117|issue=2|pages=497-501|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some children may grow out of these deficits, even coming to excel where they once lagged, while others do not. One particularly common result of language delay is delayed or inadequate acquisition of [[reading (activity)|reading]] skills. Reading depends upon an ability to code and decode script (i.e., match speech sounds with symbols, and vice versa). If a child is still struggling to master language and speech, it is very difficult to learn another level of complexity (writing). Thus, it is crucial that children have facility with language to be successful readers.

Neuroscientist [[Steven Pinker]] postulates that a certain form of language delay may be associated with exceptional and innate analytical prowess in some individuals, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Edward Teller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Steven| last=Pinker| title=His Brain Measured Up| url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1999_06_24_newyorktimes.html| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=24 June 1999| accessdate=2006-12-04| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211085927/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1999_06_24_newyorktimes.html| archivedate=11 December 2006| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Language delays are the most frequent [[developmental delay]]s, and can occur for many reasons. A delay can be due to being a “[[late bloomer]]”, “[[late talker]]”, or a more serious problem. The most common causes of speech delay include
* Hearing loss
* Slow development
* [[Intellectual disability]]

Such delays can occur in conjunction with a lack of mirroring of [[facial response]]s, unresponsiveness or unawareness of certain [[noise]]s, a lack of interest in playing with other children or toys, or no pain response to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toplanguageguide.com/language-acquisition.php |title=Language Learning Styles |date=August 2013 |publisher=TLG |accessdate=22 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823095038/http://www.toplanguageguide.com/language-acquisition.php |archivedate=23 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Frequently Asked Questions| url=http://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Resource_Centers/Autism_Resource_Center/FAQ.aspx| publisher=American Academy of Children &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry| accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes include:
* [[Psychosocial deprivation]] - The child doesn't spend enough time communicating with adults, such as babbling and joint attention. Research on early brain development shows that babies and toddlers have a critical need for direct interactions with parents and other significant care givers for healthy brain growth and the development of appropriate social, emotional, and cognitive skills.&lt;ref name="American Academy of Pediatrics"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Committee on Public Education |title=Media education |journal=Pediatrics |volume=104 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=341–3 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10429023 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/104/2/341.long |doi=10.1542/peds.104.2.341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Television]] viewing is associated with delayed language development. Children who watched television alone were 8.47 times more likely to have language delay when compared to children who interacted with their caregivers during television viewing.&lt;ref name="Chonchaiya 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chonchaiya| first1=W| last2=Pruksananonda| first2=C |title=Television viewing associates with delayed language development |journal=[[Acta Paediatrica]] |volume=97 |issue=7 |pages=977–82 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18460044 |doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00831.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some educational television shows, such as Blue's Clues, have been found to enhance a child's language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bavelier, |first1=Daphne |last2=Green |first2=Shawn |last3=Dye |first3=Matthew |title=Children, wired – for better and for worse |journal=Neuron |date=2010 |pages=692–701. |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.08.035 |pmid=20826302 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170902/}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, as recommended by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], children under the age of 2 should watch no television at all, and after age 2 watch no more than one to two hours of quality programming a day. Therefore, exposing such young children to television programs should be discouraged, especially television shows with no educational value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bavelier, |first1=Daphne |last2=Green |first2=Shawn |last3=Dye |first3=Matthew |title=Children, wired – for better and for worse |journal=Neuron |date=2010 |pages=692–701. |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.08.035 |pmid=20826302 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170902/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents should engage children in more conversational activities to avoid television-related delays to their children language development, which could impair their intellectual performance. However, in a study conducted by Dr. Birken of the Hospital for Sick Children, it was found that watching television while interacting with a parent of caregiver is actually beneficial for children who are bilingual. The study spanned four years, from 2011 to 2015, and was based on parent report and clinician observation. Over the four years it was found that if a bilingual child had interaction with an adult while watching television they did not suffer language delay and it in fact helped them develop English, their second language. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Akpan |first1=N |title=Toddler's Screen Time Linked to Slower Speech Development |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/toddlers-screen-time-linked-slower-speech-development-study-finds |website=PBS |publisher=PBS |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gender and how each gender uses technology can also impact a child's language development. The use of handheld electronics in addition to television differs between boys and girls. A survey done in 2014 in the UK by Ofcom showed that 21% of girls ages 3-4 used handheld electronics whereas 30% of boys ages 3-4 used handheld electronics. From this study, the results show that gender provides a gap between the usage of electronics when comparing boys and girls, even though they are the same age. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kucirkova|first=Natalia|last2=Littleton|first2=Karen|last3=Kyparissiadis|first3=Antonios|date=2017-01-03|title=The influence of children's gender and age on children's use of digital media at home|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12543|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=49|issue=3|pages=545–559|doi=10.1111/bjet.12543|issn=0007-1013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stress during pregnancy is associated with language delay.&lt;ref name="pmid17355398"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Talge| first1=NM| last2=Neal| first2=C| last3=Glover| first3=V |title=Antenatal maternal stress and long-term effects on child neurodevelopment: how and why? |journal=[[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] |volume=48 |issue=3-4 |pages=245–61 |year=2007 |pmid=17355398 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01714.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Being a twin or a younger sibling increases the chance of speech and language delays. Reasons for this are thought to include less one-on-one time with parents, premature birth with twins, and the companionship of their twin sibling reducing their motivation to talk to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twinpickle.com/2017/11/07/do-twins-talk-to-each-other/|title=Do Twins Talk to Each Other in a Secret Language?|date=2017-11-07|work=Twin Pickle|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With being a younger sibling, it can also be linked to less one on one time with their parents or guardians. Older siblings also tend to talk for their younger siblings, giving them less opportunities to grow their language skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turnbull |first1=Khara |last2=Justice |first2=Laura |title=Language Development from Theory to Practice |date=2017 |publisher=Pearson |edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]{{fact|date=December 2016}}
* [[Autism]] (a developmental disorder) - There is strong evidence that autism is commonly associated with language delay.&lt;ref name="pmid16608544"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miniscalco| first1=C| last2=Nygren| first2=G| last3=Hagberg| first3=B| last4=Kadesjö| first4=B| last5=Gillberg| first5=C |title=Neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental outcome of children at age 6 and 7 years who screened positive for language problems at 30 months |journal=[[Developmental Medicine &amp; Child Neurology]] |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=361–6 |date=May 2006 |doi=10.1017/S0012162206000788| pmid=16608544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19713073"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hagberg BS, Miniscalco C, Gillberg C |title=Clinic attenders with autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: cognitive profile at school age and its relationship to preschool indicators of language delay |journal=[[Research in Developmental Disabilities]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2010 |pmid=19713073 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2009.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asperger syndrome]], which is on the autistic spectrum, however, is not associated with language delay.&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00&gt;{{cite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |edition=4 |location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |oclc=768475353 |url=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Selective mutism]] (an anxiety disorder that is expressed by loss of speech)
* [[Cerebral palsy]] (a movement disorder caused by brain damage)
* Genetic abnormalities - In 2005, researchers found a connection between expressive language delay and a genetic abnormality: a duplicate set of the same genes that are missing in sufferers of [[Williams-Beuren syndrome]]. Also so called [[XYY syndrome]] can often cause speech delay.&lt;ref&gt;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/47xyy-syndrome&lt;/ref&gt;
* Correlation with male sex, previous family history, and maternal education has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campbell| first1=T F| last2=Dollaghan| first2=C A| last3=Rockette| first3=H E| last4=Paradise| first4=J L| last5=Feldman| first5=H M| last6=Shriberg| first6=L D| last7=Sabo| first7=D L| last8=Kurs-Lasky| first8=M| title=Risk factors for speech delay of unknown origin in 3-year-old children| journal=[[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]]| date=2002| volume=74| issue=2| pages=346–57| pmid=12705559| url=http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/phonology/pubs/PUB18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Studies have failed to find clear evidence that a language delay can be prevented by training or educating health care professionals in the subject. Overall, some of the reviews show positive results regarding interventions in language delay, but are not curative.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary - Early Identification of Language Delays, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
To treat an already existing language delay a child would need Speech and Language Therapy to correct any deficits. These therapists can be found in schools, clinics, through home care agencies, and also colleges where Communication Sciences and Disorders are studied. Aside from these, it is still encouraged for the child's parent to get involved. A few ways that a parent could get involved with helping to  improve a child’s language and speech skills includes speaking to their child with enthusiasm, engaging in conversations revolving what the child is focusing on, and reading to their child frequently. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thespec.com/|title=When to worry if a child has too few words|last1=Klass|first1=Perri|date=2010|website=The Hamilton Spectator|publisher=The Hamilton Spectator|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social and play skills appear to be more difficult for children with language delays due to their decreased experience in conversation. [[Speech pathologist|Speech Pathologists]] utilize methods such as prompting to improve a child's social skills through play intervention. While recent studies have consistently found play intervention to be helpful, further research is required in order to determine the effectiveness of this form of therapy. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sualy|first=Abbey|last2=Yount|first2=Sara|last3=Kelly-Vance|first3=Lisa|last4=Ryalls|first4=Brigette|date=2011|title=Using a play intervention to improve the play skills of children with a language delay|url=https://web-a-ebscohost-com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=d05a7084-3661-4cd4-bbde-065956fef94a%40sessionmgr4009|journal=International Journal of Psychology|volume=|pages=105-122|via=PsychINFO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London: Sage Publications. p. 1007. {{ISBN|1412988764}}.

[[Roderick T. Long]]. "Toward a libertarian theory of class." ''Social Philosophy and Policy''. Volume 15. Issue 02. Summer 1998. p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian socialism also rejects the [[State (polity)|state]] itself,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"So, libertarian socialism rejects the idea of state ownership and control of the economy, along with the state as such. Through workers' self-management it proposes to bring an end to authority, exploitation, and hierarchy in production." [http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionI1 "I1.

Blackwell Pub, 2003. p. 612&lt;/ref&gt; and criticizes [[Wage slavery|wage labour relationships within the workplace]],&lt;ref&gt;"Therefore, rather than being an oxymoron, "libertarian socialism" indicates that true socialism must be libertarian and that a libertarian who is not a socialist is a phoney. As true socialists oppose wage labour, they must also oppose the state for the same reasons. Similarly, libertarians must oppose wage labour for the same reasons they must oppose the state." [http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionI1 "I1.

Charles Masquelier. ''Critical theory and libertarian socialism: Realizing the political potential of critical social theory.'' Bloombury.

A politics that is completely revolutionary because it seeks to transform all of reality. We do not think that capturing the economy and the state lead automatically to the transformation of the rest of social being, nor do we equate liberation with changing our life-styles and our heads.

"What it Really Stands for Anarchy" in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows "They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, – follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx."

== Overview ==
[[File:Le libertaire 25.png|thumb|left|250px|The August 17, 1860 edition of [[libertarian communist]] publication ''Le Libertaire'' edited by [[Joseph Déjacque]]]]
Libertarian socialism is a Western philosophy with diverse interpretations, though some general commonalities can be found in its many incarnations. It advocates a worker-oriented system of production and organization in the workplace that in some aspects radically departs from [[neoclassical economics]] in favor of democratic [[cooperative]]s or [[common ownership]] of the means of production (socialism).&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Frank H. ''The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty'' Transaction Publishers (1994) p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; They propose that this economic system be executed in a manner that attempts to maximize the [[liberty]] of individuals and minimize [[Elite|concentration of power]] or authority ([[libertarianism]]).

Libertarian socialists are strongly critical of coercive institutions, which often leads them to reject the legitimacy of the state in favor of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel, Henry. ''The Growth of Economic Thought'' Duke University Press (1991) p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents propose achieving this through decentralization of political and economic power, usually involving the socialization of most large-scale private property and enterprise (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]). Libertarian socialism tends to deny the legitimacy of most forms of economically significant private property, viewing capitalist property relation as a form of domination that is antagonistic to individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Ellen Frankel et al. ''Problems of Market Liberalism'' Cambridge University Press (1998) p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, libertarian socialism retains respect for personal property.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first anarchist journal to use the term "libertarian" was ''Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social'' and it was published in New York City between 1858 and 1861 by French anarcho-communist [[Joseph Déjacque]].&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/The_Anarchist_FAQ_Editorial_Collective__150_years_of_Libertarian.html The Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective]. "150 years of Libertarian".&lt;/ref&gt; The next recorded use of the term was in Europe, when "libertarian communism" was used at a French regional anarchist Congress at Le Havre (16–22 November 1880). January 1881 saw a French manifesto issued on "Libertarian or Anarchist Communism". Finally, 1895 saw leading anarchists [[Sébastien Faure]] and [[Louise Michel]] publish ''La Libertaire'' in France".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary"/&gt; The word stems from the [[French language|French]] word ''libertaire'', which was used to evade the [[lois scélérates|French ban on anarchist publications]].&lt;ref name="Graham2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Graham|title=We Do Not Fear Anarchy—We Invoke It: The First International and the Origins of the Anarchist Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRdjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT8|date=23 June 2015|publisher=AK Press|isbn=978-1-84935-211-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this tradition, the term "libertarianism" in "libertarian socialism" is generally used as a synonym for anarchism, which some say is the original meaning of the term; hence "libertarian socialism" is equivalent to "socialist anarchism" to these scholars.&lt;ref name="Noam Chomsky 2004, p. 739"&gt;Chomsky, Noam (2004). ''Language and Politics''. In Otero, Carlos Peregrín. AK Press. p. 739.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perlin|first=Terry M.|title=Contemporary Anarchism|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1979|page=40|isbn=978-0-87855-097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of the European socialist movement, "libertarian" has conventionally been used to describe those who opposed [[state socialism]], such as Mikhail Bakunin.

The association of socialism with libertarianism predates that of capitalism and many anti-authoritarians still decry what they see as a mistaken association of [[capitalism]] with [[libertarianism in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray, ''The Modern Crisis'', Black Rose Books (1987), pp. 154–55 {{ISBN|0-920057-61-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Noam Chomsky]] put it, a consistent libertarian "must oppose [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and [[wage slavery]], which is a component of this system, as incompatible with the principle that labor must be freely undertaken and under the control of the producer".&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (2003) p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Noam chomsky cropped.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky is one of the most well-known contemporary libertarian socialist thinkers]]
In a chapter recounting the history of libertarian socialism, economist [[Robin Hahnel]] relates that thus far the period where libertarian socialism has had its greatest impact was at the end of the 19th century through the first four decades of the 20th century: {{cquote|Early in the twentieth century, libertarian socialism was as powerful a force as social democracy and [[communism]]. The [[Anarchist St. Imier International|Libertarian International]]—founded at the Congress of Saint Imier a few days after the split between Marxist and libertarians at the congress of the [[First International|Socialist International]] held in [[Hague Congress (1872)|The Hague in 1872]]—competed successfully against social democrats and communists alike for the loyalty of anticapitalist activists, revolutionaries, workers, unions and political parties for over fifty years. Libertarian socialists played a major role in the Russian revolutions of [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905]] and [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917]]. Libertarian socialists played a dominant role in the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1911. Twenty years after World War I was over, libertarian socialists were still strong enough to spearhead the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|social revolution that swept across Republican Spain]] in 1936 and 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnel, Robin. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CI5d2CpL60oC ''Economic Justice and Democracy''], Routledge Press, 2005, p. 138 {{ISBN|0-415-93344-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, a libertarian trend also developed within [[Marxism]] which gained visibility around the late 1910s mainly in reaction against [[Bolshevism]] and Leninism rising to power and establishing the [[Soviet Union]].

=== Anti-capitalism ===
{{main|Anti-capitalism}}
{{Socialism sidebar|Variants}}
John O'Neil argues: {{cquote|It is forgotten that the early defenders of commercial society like [[Adam Smith|(Adam) Smith]] were as much concerned with criticising the associational blocks to mobile labour represented by [[guilds]] as they were to the activities of the state. The [[History of socialism|history of socialist thought]] includes a long associational and anti-statist tradition prior to the political victory of the [[Bolshevism]] in the east and varieties of [[Fabianism]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neil.  ''The Market: Ethics, knowledge and politics''. Routledge. 1998. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Libertarian socialists are anti-capitalist and can thus be distinguished from [[Right-libertarianism|right-wing libertarians]]. Whereas capitalist (and right-libertarian) principles concentrate economic power in the hands of those who own the most capital, libertarian socialism aims to distribute power more widely amongst members of society. A key difference between libertarian socialism and [[Neoliberalism|capitalist libertarianism]] is that advocates of the former generally believe that one's degree of freedom is affected by one's economic and social status whereas advocates of the latter focus on freedom of choice within a capitalist framework. This is sometimes characterized as a desire to maximize "free creativity" in a society in preference to "free enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (2003) pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Within anarchism, there emerged a critique of [[wage slavery]] which refers to a situation perceived as quasi-[[voluntary slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |publisher= [[Merriam Webster|merriam-webster.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |publisher= [[dictionary.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[connotation|negatively connoted]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and [[employment|renting]] a person. The term "wage slavery" has been used to criticize [[economic exploitation]] and [[social stratification]], with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in [[sweatshops]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandel|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KdrTfTxqvgC&amp;pg=PA184 184]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter as a lack of [[workers' self-management]], fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy.&lt;ref name="globetrotter.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky |page=2|publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallgrimsdottir|Benoit|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spunk.org"&gt;{{cite web |title= The Bolsheviks and Workers Control, 1917–1921: The State and Counter-revolution |url= http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/russia/sp001861/bolintro.html |publisher= [[Spunk Library]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian socialists believe that by valuing freedom society works towards a system in which individuals have the power to decide economic issues along with political issues. Libertarian socialists seek to replace unjustified authority with direct democracy, voluntary federation and popular autonomy in all aspects of life,&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Austin, et al. 'Encyclopedia of Social Theory' Routledge (2006) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; including physical communities and economic enterprises. With the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], thinkers such as [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Karl Marx]] elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Proudhon|1890}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marx 1863 c7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1969|loc=[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch07.htm Chapter VII]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luddite]]s emphasized the [[dehumanization]] brought about by machines while later [[Emma Goldman]] famously denounced wage slavery by saying: "The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldman|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IF7CusxuMcC&amp;pg=PA283 283]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many libertarian socialists believe that large-scale voluntary associations should manage industrial production while workers retain rights to the individual products of their labor.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann, Albert S. 'A History of European Socialism' Yale University Press (1983) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; They see a distinction between concepts of "private property" and "[[Personal property|personal possession]]". "Private property" grants an individual exclusive control over a thing whether it is in use or not; and regardless of its productive capacity, "possession" grants no rights to things that are not in use.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, Richard et al. 'Property and Contract in Their Relations to the Distribution of Wealth' The Macmillan Company (1914)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "[[Refusal of work|the separation of work and life is questioned]] and alternatives suggested that are underpinned by notions of dignity, self-realization and freedom from domination and exploitation. Here, a [[Negative liberty|freedom that is not restrictively negative]] (as in [[neo-liberal]] conceptions) but is, as well, [[Positive liberty|positive – connected, that is, to views about human flourishing]] – is important, a profoundly embedded understanding of freedom, which ties freedom to its social, communal conditions and, importantly, refuses to separate questions of freedom from those of equality".&lt;ref&gt;Chamsy el- Ojeili. Beyond post-socialism. Dialogues with the far-left. Palgrave Macmillan. 2015. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-authoritarianism and opposition to the state ===
{{main|Anti-statism|anti-authoritarianism}}
{{Anarchism sidebar|Related}}
{{Libertarianism sidebar|Schools}}
Libertarian socialists generally regard concentrations of power as sources of oppression that must be continually challenged and justified. Most libertarian socialists believe that when power is exercised as exemplified by the economic, social, or physical dominance of one individual over another, the burden of proof is always on the authoritarian to justify their action as legitimate when taken against its effect of narrowing the scope of human freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (2004) p. 775&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian socialists typically oppose rigid and stratified structures of authority, be they [[political power|political]], [[economic power|economic]], or social.&lt;ref&gt;Ed, Andrew. 'Closing the Iron Cage: The Scientific Management of Work and Leisure' Black Rose Books (1999) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In lieu of corporations and states, libertarian socialists seek to organize society into voluntary associations (usually [[collective]]s, [[intentional community|communes]], [[Municipality|municipalities]], [[cooperative]]s, [[commons]], or [[Syndicalism|syndicates]]) that use direct democracy or [[consensus]] for their decision-making process. Some libertarian socialists advocate combining these institutions using rotating, recallable [[Wiktionary:Delegate|delegates]] to higher-level federations.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F06arcQyYEgC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Social Anarchism Or Lifestyle Anarchism''], AK Press (1995), pp. 71–72, {{ISBN|1-873176-83-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spanish anarchism]] is a major example of such federations in practice.

Contemporary examples of libertarian socialist organizational and decision-making models in practice include a number of anti-capitalist and global justice movements&lt;ref&gt;Purkis, Jon. Bowen, James. 'Changing Anarchism' Manchester University Press (2004) pp. 165, 179&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] [[Councils of Good Government]] and the global [[Indymedia]] network (which covers 45 countries on six continents). There are also many examples of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] societies around the world whose political and economic systems can be accurately described as anarchist or libertarian socialist, each of which is unique and uniquely suited to the culture that birthed it.&lt;ref&gt;Graeber, David. "Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology" Prickly Paradigm Press (2004) pp. 22–23, 26–29&lt;/ref&gt; For libertarians, that diversity of practice within a framework of common principles is proof of the vitality of those principles and of their flexibility and strength.

Contrary to popular opinion, libertarian socialism has not traditionally been a [[utopia]]n movement, tending to avoid dense theoretical analysis or prediction of what a future society would or should look like. The tradition instead has been that such decisions cannot be made now and must be made through struggle and experimentation, so that the best solution can be arrived at democratically and organically; and to base the direction for struggle on established historical example. They point out that the success of the [[scientific method]] comes from its adherence to open rational exploration, not its conclusions, in sharp contrast to [[dogma]] and predetermined predictions. Noted anarchist [[Rudolf Rocker]] once stated: "I am an anarchist not because I believe anarchism is the final goal, but because there is no such thing as a final goal".&lt;ref&gt;''The London Years'', 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Because libertarian socialism encourages exploration and embraces a diversity of ideas rather than forming a compact movement, there have arisen inevitable controversies over individuals who describe themselves as libertarian socialists yet disagree with some of the core principles of libertarian socialism. For example, [[Peter Hain]] interprets libertarian socialism as minarchist rather than anarchist, favoring radical decentralization of power without going as far as the complete abolition of the state&lt;ref&gt;Hain, Peter "Rediscovering our Libertarian Roots" Chartist (August 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and libertarian socialist Noam Chomsky supports dismantling all forms of unjustified social or economic power while also emphasizing that state intervention should be supported as a temporary protection while oppressive structures remain in existence.

Proponents are known for opposing the existence of states or government and refusing to participate in coercive state institutions. Indeed, in the past many refused to swear oaths in court or to participate in trials, even when they faced imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. ''The Spanish Anarchists: The Heroic Years, 1868–1936]]'' AK Press (1998) p. 112 {{ISBN|1-873176-04-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or deportation.&lt;ref&gt;Polenberg, Richard [https://books.google.com/books?id=UCvOpLFFVSgC&amp;printsec=frontcover Fighting Faiths: The Abrams Case, the Supreme Court, and Free Speech]. Cornell University Press (1999) pp. 127–30 {{ISBN|0-8014-8618-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Chamsy el-Ojeili, "it is frequently to forms of working-class or popular self-organization that Left communists look in answer to the questions of the struggle for socialism, revolution and post-capitalist social organization. Nevertheless, Left communists have often continued to organize themselves into party-like structures that undertake agitation, propaganda, education and other forms of political intervention. This is a vexed issue across Left communism and has resulted in a number of significant variations – from the absolute rejection of separate parties in favour of mere study or [[affinity groups]], to the critique of the naivety of pure spontaneism and an insistence on the necessary, though often modest, role of disciplined, self- critical and popularly connected communist organizations".&lt;ref&gt;Chamsy el- Ojeili. ''Beyond post-socialism. Dialogues with the far-left.'' Palgrave Macmillan. 2015. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil liberties and individual freedom ===
{{main|Free love|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex|Anarchism and religion|Anarcha-feminism|Anarchism and education|Queer anarchism|Individualist anarchism}}
Libertarian socialists have been strong advocates and activists of [[civil liberties]] that provide an individual specific rights such as the freedom in issues of love and sex (free love) (see [[anarchism and issues related to love and sex]]) and of thought and conscience ([[freethought]]). In this activism, they have clashed with state and religious institutions which have limited such rights (see [[anarchism and religion]]). Anarchism has been an important advocate of free love since its birth. A strong tendency of free love later appeared alongside [[anarcha-feminism]] and advocacy of [[LGBT rights]] (see [[Queer anarchism|anarchism and issues related to LGBTI persons]]).

Anarcha-feminism developed as a synthesis of radical feminism and anarchism that views patriarchy (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government. It was inspired by the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], Emma Goldman, [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] and [[Virginia Bolten]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticise and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and gender roles. Council communist [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] was also a feminist activist as well as a [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxist]]. Anarchists also took a pioneering [[Queer anarchism|interest in issues related to LGBTI persons]].

=== Violent and non-violent means ===
{{see also|Anarchism and violence}}
Some libertarian socialists see violent revolution as necessary in the abolition of capitalist society while others advocate non-violent methods. Along with many others, [[Errico Malatesta]] argued that the use of violence was necessary. As he put it in ''[[Umanità Nova]]'' (no. 125, September 6, 1921): {{cquote|It is our aspiration and our aim that everyone should become socially conscious and effective; but to achieve this end, it is necessary to provide all with the means of life and for development, and it is therefore necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the violence that denies these means to the workers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Umanità Nova]], n. 125, September 6, 1921. A translation can be found at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1921/09/haste.htm The revolutionary haste by Errico Malatesta]. Retrieved June 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon argued in favor of a [[non-violent revolution]] through a process of [[dual power]] in which libertarian socialist institutions would be established and form associations enabling the formation of an expanding network within the existing state capitalist framework with the intention of eventually rendering both the state and the capitalist economy obsolete. The progression towards violence in anarchism stemmed in part from the massacres of some of the communes inspired by the ideas of Proudhon and others. Many anarcho-communists began to see a need for revolutionary violence to counteract the violence inherent in both capitalism and government.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Emma. 'Anarchism and Other Essays' Mother Earth (1910) p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-pacifism]] is a tendency within the anarchist movement which rejects the use of violence in the struggle for social change.&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"&gt;Woodcock&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence "Resisting the Nation State, the pacifist and anarchist tradition" by Geoffrey Ostergaard]. Ppu.org.uk (1945-08-06). Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The main early influences were the thought of [[Henry David Thoreau]]&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; and [[Leo Tolstoy]].&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; It developed "mostly in {{Sic|[[Netherlands|Holland]]}}, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War".&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, p. 21: "Finally, somewhat aside from the curve that runs from [[anarchist individualism]] to [[anarcho-syndicalism]], we come to [[Tolstoyanism]] and to pacifist anarchism that appeared, mostly in [[Netherlands|Holland]] ''(sic)'', Britain, and the United states, before and after the Second World War and which has continued since then in the deep in the anarchist involvement in the protests against nuclear armament."&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the use of violence has not prohibited anarcho-pacifists from accepting the principle of resistance or even [[Nonviolent revolution|revolutionary action]], provided it does not result in violence; it was in fact their approval of such forms of opposition to power that lead many anarcho-pacifists to endorse the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] concept of the general strike as the great revolutionary weapon. Anarcho-pacifists have also come to endorse to non-violent strategy of dual power.

Other anarchists have believed that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified as a way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a [[social revolution]].

De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]].

[[File:Levellers declaration and standard.gif|thumb|250px|Woodcut from a [[Diggers]] document by [[William Everard (Digger)|William Everard]]]]
For Roderick T. Long, libertarian socialists claim the 17th century [[Levellers|English Levellers]] among their ideological forebears.&lt;ref name="Roderick T 1998. Pg. 310"&gt;Roderick T. Long. "Toward a libertarian theory of class." ''Social Philosophy and Policy''. Volume 15. Issue 02. Summer 1998. p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; Various libertarian socialist authors have identified the written work of English Protestant social reformer [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and the social activism of his group (the Diggers) as anticipating this line of thought.&lt;ref&gt;"It was in these conditions of class struggle that, among a whole cluster of radical groups such as the Fifth Monarchy Men, the Levellers and the Ranters, there emerged perhaps the first real proto-anarchists, the Diggers, who like the classical 19th-century anarchists identified political and economic power and who believed that a social, rather than political revolution was necessary for the establishment of justice. Gerrard Winstanley, the Diggers' leader, made an identification with the word of God and the principle of reason, an equivalent philosophy to that found in [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]''. In fact, it seems likely Tolstoy took much of his own inspiration from Winstanley "[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Marlow__Anarchism_and_Christianity.html Marlow. "Anarchism and Christianity"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"While the ideal commonwealth conceived by [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] tried to combine the existence of a powerful state with respect for the political rights of the citizens, [[Thomas Hobbes]] and Gerrard Winstanley, for opposite reasons, denied the possibility of power being shared between the state and the people...Before defining the government of a true Commonwealth Winstanley denounces the kingly government based on property and like Proudhon he believes that "[[property is theft]]". [[Marie Louise Berneri]] "[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Marie_Louise_Berneri__Utopias_of_the_English_Revolution.html#toc10 "Utopias of the English Revolution"]&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchist historian George Woodcock, although Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first was [[Gerrard Winstanley]] (1609–c. 1660), a linen draper who led the small movement of the Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the [[English Civil War]] and against the inequality that the grandees of the [[New Model Army]] seemed intent on preserving.&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary1"&gt;George Woodcock [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/George_Woodcock__Anarchism.html "Anarchism"]. ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1649–1650, the Diggers squatted on stretches of common land in southern England and attempted to set up communities based on work on the land and the sharing of goods. The communities failed, but a series of pamphlets by Winstanley survived, of which ''The New Law of Righteousness'' (1649) was the most important. Advocating a rational Christianity, Winstanley equated Christ with "the universal liberty" and declared the universally corrupting nature of authority. He saw "an equal privilege to share in the blessing of liberty" and detected an intimate link between the institution of property and the lack of freedom.&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary1"/&gt;

Murray Bookchin said: "In the modern world, anarchism first appeared as a movement of the peasantry and yeomanry against declining feudal institutions. In Germany its foremost spokesman during the Peasant Wars was [[Thomas Muenzer]]. The concepts held by Muenzer and Winstanley were superbly attuned to the needs of their time – a historical period when the majority of the population lived in the countryside and when the most militant revolutionary forces came from an agrarian world. It would be painfully academic to argue whether Muenzer and Winstanley could have achieved their ideals. What is of real importance is that they spoke to their time; their anarchist concepts followed naturally from the rural society that furnished the bands of the peasant armies in Germany and the New Model in England".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Lewis_Herber__Murray_Bookchin___Ecology_and_Revolutionary_Thought.html Lewis Herber.

==== The Enlightenment ====
[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[William Godwin]]]]
For Long, libertarian socialists also often share a view of ancestry in the 18th century [[French Encyclopédistes|French encyclopedists]] alongside [[Thomas Jefferson]]&lt;ref&gt;"It was the great service of liberal thinkers like Jefferson and Paine that they recognized the natural limitations of every form of government. That is why they did not want to see the state become a terrestrial Providence which in its infallibility would make on its own every decision, thereby not only blocking the road to higher forms of social development, but also crippling the natural sense of responsibility of the people which is the essential condition for every prosperous society." Rudolf Rocker. ''[[Pioneers of American Freedom]]: Origin of Liberal and radical thought in America.'' J. J. Lttle Ives &amp; Ives Company, New York. 1949. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Anarchists are simply unterrified Jeffersonian Democrats. They believe that the best government is that which governs least," and that that which governs least is no government at all." Benjamin Tucker. ''Individual Liberty''. New York. Vanguard Press. MCMXXVI. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"At one end of an institutional continuum one can place the total institutions that routinely destroy the autonomy and initiative of their subjects. At the other end of this continuum lies, perhaps, some ideal version of Jeffersonian democracy composed of independent, self-reliant, self-respecting, landowning farmers, managers of their own small enterprises, answerable to themselves, free of debt, and more generally with no institutional reason for servility or deference. Such free-standing farmers, Jefferson thought, were the basis of a vigorous and independent public sphere where citizens could speak their mind without fear or favor. Somewhere in between these two poles lies the contemporary situation of most citizens of Western democracies: a relatively open public sphere but a quotidian institutional experience that is largely at cross purposes with the implicit assumptions behind this public sphere and encouraging and often rewarding caution, deference, servility, and conformity."

The anarchist library (2011-02-12). Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; For Woodcock, a more elaborate sketch of anarchism—although still without the name—was provided by [[William Godwin]] in his ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]'' (1793). Godwin was a gradualist anarchist rather than a revolutionary anarchist as he differed from most later anarchists in preferring above revolutionary action the gradual and—as it seemed to him—more natural process of discussion among men of good will, by which he hoped truth would eventually triumph through its own power. Godwin, who was influenced by the English tradition of Dissent and the French philosophy of the Enlightenment, put forward in a developed form the basic anarchist criticisms of the state, of accumulated property and of the delegation of authority through democratic procedure.&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary1"/&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], [[Sylvain Maréchal]] in his ''Manifesto of the Equals'' (1796) demanded "the communal enjoyment of the fruits of the earth" and looked forward to the disappearance of "the revolting distinction of rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and valets, of governors and governed".&lt;ref name="Graham-2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="graham2005-v1"/&gt; The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642 during the English Civil War as a [[Pejorative|term of abuse]], used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] against their [[Roundhead]] opponents.&lt;ref name=BBC-Anarchism/&gt; By the time of the French Revolution, some such as the ''[[Enragés]]'' began to use the term positively&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean.

[[File:Hw-fourier.jpg|thumb|200px|Charles Fourier]]
In his preface to Peter Kropotkin's book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'', Kent Bromley considered early French socialist Charles Fourier to be the founder of the libertarian branch of socialist thought as opposed to the [[Authoritarian socialism|authoritarian socialist]] ideas of [[François-Noël Babeuf]] and [[Philippe Buonarroti]].&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter. ''The Conquest of Bread'', preface by Kent Bromley, New York and London, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist [[Hakim Bey]] describes Fourier's ideas as follows: "In Fourier's system of Harmony all creative activity including industry, craft, agriculture, etc. will arise from liberated passion – this is the famous theory of "attractive labor." Fourier sexualizes work itself – the life of the [[Phalanstère|Phalanstery]] is a continual orgy of intense feeling, intellection, &amp; activity, a society of lovers &amp; wild enthusiasts". Fourierism manifested itself in the middle of the 19th century, where hundreds of communes (phalansteries) were founded on Fourierist principles in France, North America, Mexico, South America, Algeria, and Yugoslavia. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, [[Friedrich Engels]] and Peter Kropotkin all read him with fascination as did [[André Breton]] and [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hakim Bey]] (1991) [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Hakim_Bey__The_Lemonade_Ocean___Modern_Times.html "The Lemonade Ocean &amp; Modern Times"]&lt;/ref&gt; In his influential work ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', [[Herbert Marcuse]] praised Fourier by saying that he "comes closer than any other utopian socialist to elucidating the dependence of freedom on non-repressive [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Marcuse]].

Anarchist Peter Sabatini reports that in the United States of early to mid-19th century, "there appeared an array of communal and "utopian" counterculture groups (including the so-called free love movement). [[William Godwin]]'s anarchism exerted an ideological influence on some of this, but more so the socialism of [[Robert Owen]] and Charles Fourier. After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at [[New Harmony, Indiana]] during 1825. One member of this commune was Josiah Warren (1798–1874), considered to be the first individualist anarchist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Peter_Sabatini__Libertarianism__Bogus_Anarchy.html Peter Sabatini.

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who is often considered the father of modern anarchism, coined the phrase "[[Property is theft]]" to describe part of his view on the complex nature of ownership in relation to freedom. When he said property is theft, he was referring to the capitalist who he believed stole profit from laborers. For Proudhon, the capitalist's employee was "subordinated, exploited: his permanent condition is one of obedience".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://fair-use.org/p-j-proudhon/general-idea-of-the-revolution/organization-of-economic-forces#s3p5 General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'' (1851), Sixth Study, § 3 ¶ 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventeen years (1857) after Proudhon first called himself an anarchist (1840), [[anarcho-communist]] [[Joseph Déjacque]] was the first person to describe himself as a libertarian.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Déjacque, [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm "De l'être-humain mâle et femelle–Lettre à P.J. Proudhon"] (1857).&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the United States, "libertarian" generally refers to anti-authoritarian [[anticapitalist|anti-capitalist]] ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126081805/http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA1.html |archivedate=2009-01-26 |title=An Anarchism FAQ – A.1 What is anarchism? |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=January 26, 2009 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian socialism has its roots in both [[classical liberalism]] and socialism, though it is often in conflict with [[liberalism]] (especially [[neoliberalism]] and right-libertarianism) and authoritarian [[state socialism]] simultaneously. While libertarian socialism has roots in both socialism and liberalism, different forms have different levels of influence from the two traditions. For instance, [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] anarchism is more influenced by liberalism while communist and syndicalist anarchism are more influenced by socialism. However, mutualist anarchism has its origins in 18th and 19th century European socialism (such as Fourierian socialism)&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. ''What is Mutualism?''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[Ricardian socialism]]". The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought. 1987. p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; while communist and syndicalist anarchism has its earliest origins in early 18th century liberalism (such as the [[French Revolution]]).&lt;ref name="graham2005-v1"&gt;[[Robert Graham (historian)|Graham, Robert]]. [[Anarchism - A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]] – Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300 CE to 1939), Black Rose Books, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchism posed an early challenge to the [[vanguardism]] and [[statism]] it detected in important sectors of the socialist movement. As such: "The consequences of the growth of parliamentary action, ministerialism, and party life, charged the anarchists, would be de-radicalism and embourgeoisiement. Further, state politics would subvert both true individuality and true community. In response, many anarchists refused Marxist-type organisation, seeking to dissolve or undermine power and hierarchy by way of loose political-cultural groupings, or by championing organisation by a single, simultaneously economic and political administrative unit (Ruhle, [[Syndicalism]]). The power of the intellectual and of science were also rejected by many anarchists: "In conquering the state, in exalting the role of parties, they [intellectuals] reinforce the hierarchical principle embodied in political and administrative institutions". Revolutions could only come through force of circumstances and/or the inherently rebellious instincts of the masses (the "instinct for freedom" (Bakunin, Chomsky)). Thus, in Bakunin's words: "All that individuals can do is to clarify, propagate, and work out ideas corresponding to the popular instinct".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ojeili |first=Chamsy |date= November 2001|title= The "Advance Without Authority": Post-modernism, Libertarian Socialism, and Intellectuals |url=http://www.democracynature.org/vol7/ojeili_intellectuals.htm |journal=Democracy &amp; Nature |volume=7 |issue= 3|doi= 10.1080/10855660120092294|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages= 391–413|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marxism ===
{{main|Libertarian Marxism}}
{{see also|Anarchism and Marxism}}
[[File:William Morris age 53.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Morris]], early English [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxist]]]]
Marxism started to develop a libertarian strand of thought after specific circumstances. Chamsy Ojeili said: "One does find early expressions of such perspectives in [[William Morris|(William) Morris]] and the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (the SPGB), then again around the events of 1905, with the growing concern at the bureaucratisation and de-radicalisation of international socialism".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt; Morris established the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] in December 1884, which was encouraged by Friedrich Engels and [[Eleanor Marx]]. As the leading figure in the organization, Morris embarked on a relentless series of speeches and talks on street corners in working men's clubs and lecture theatres across England and Scotland. From 1887, anarchists began to outnumber socialists in the Socialist League.&lt;ref name="Beer, p. 256"&gt;Beer, ''A History of British Socialism,'' vol. 2, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd Annual Conference of the League, held in London on 29 May 1887, marked the change with a majority of the 24 branch delegates voting in favor of an anarchist-sponsored resolution declaring: "This conference endorses the policy of abstention from parliamentary action, hitherto pursued by the League, and sees no sufficient reason for altering it".&lt;ref&gt;''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 48.'' New York: International Publishers, 2001; p. 538, fn. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris played peacemaker, but he sided with the anti-Parliamentarians, who won control of the League, which consequently lost the support of Engels and saw the departure of Eleanor Marx and her partner [[Edward Aveling]] to form the separate [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)#Anarchist control|Bloomsbury Socialist Society]].
[[File:Zetkin luxemburg1910.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Clara Zetkin]] and Rosa Luxemburg, 1910]]
However, "the most important ruptures are to be traced to the insurgency during and after the First World War. Disillusioned with the capitulation of the social democrats, excited by the emergence of workers' councils, and slowly distanced from Leninism, many communists came to reject the claims of socialist parties and to put their faith instead in the masses". For these socialists, "[t]he intuition of the masses in action can have more genius in it than the work of the greatest individual genius". [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s workerism and spontaneism are exemplary of positions later taken up by the far-left of the period—[[Antonie Pannekoek]], Roland Holst and [[Herman Gorter]] in the Netherlands, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] in Britain, [[Antonio Gramsci]] in Italy and [[György Lukács]] in Hungary. In these formulations, the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] was to be the dictatorship of a class, "not of a party or of a clique".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt; However, within this line of thought "[t]he tension between anti-vanguardism and vanguardism has frequently resolved itself in two diametrically opposed ways: the first involved a drift towards the party; the second saw a move towards the idea of complete proletarian spontaneity...The first course is exemplified most clearly in Gramsci and [[György Lukács|Lukacs]]...The second course is illustrated in the tendency, developing from the Dutch and German far-lefts, which inclined towards the complete eradication of the party form".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt;

In the emerging [[Soviet Union]], there appeared [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]] which were a series of [[rebellion]]s and uprisings against the [[Bolsheviks]] led or supported by left-wing groups including [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]],&lt;ref name="carr1985"&gt;Carr, E.H. – The Bolshevik Revolution 1917–1923. W. W. Norton &amp; Company 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], [[Mensheviks]] and [[anarchists]].&lt;ref name="avrich1968"&gt;[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]]. "Russian Anarchists and the Civil War", ''Russian Review'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Jul., 1968), pp. 296–306. [[Blackwell Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some were in support of the [[White Movement]] while some tried to be an independent force. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued through the [[Russian Civil War]] and after until 1922. In response, the Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to get these groups to join the government and suppressed them with force. ''[["Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' is a work by [[Vladimir Lenin]] himself attacking assorted critics of the Bolsheviks who claimed positions to their left.

For many Marxian libertarian socialists, "the political bankruptcy of socialist orthodoxy necessitated a theoretical break. This break took a number of forms. The [[Bordigism|Bordigists]] and the SPGB championed a super-Marxian intransigence in theoretical matters. Other socialists made a return "behind Marx" to the [[anti-positivist]] programme of [[German idealism]]. Libertarian socialism has frequently linked its anti-authoritarian political aspirations with this theoretical differentiation from orthodoxy... [[Karl Korsch]]... remained a libertarian socialist for a large part of his life and because of the persistent urge towards theoretical openness in his work. Korsch rejected the eternal and static, and he was obsessed by the essential role of  practice in a theory's truth. For Korsch, no theory could escape history, not even Marxism. In this vein, Korsch even credited the stimulus for Marx's Capital to the movement of the oppressed classes".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt;

In rejecting both capitalism and the state, some libertarian Marxists align themselves with anarchists in opposition to both capitalist [[representative democracy]] and to authoritarian forms of Marxism. Although anarchists and Marxists share an ultimate goal of a stateless society, anarchists criticise most Marxists for advocating a transitional phase under which the state is used to achieve this aim. Nonetheless, libertarian Marxist tendencies such as [[autonomist Marxism]] and council communism have historically been intertwined with the anarchist movement. Anarchist movements have come into conflict with both capitalist and Marxist forces, sometimes at the same time—as in the [[Spanish Civil War]]—though as in that war Marxists themselves are often divided in support or opposition to anarchism. Other political persecutions under bureaucratic parties have resulted in a strong historical antagonism between anarchists and libertarian Marxists on the one hand and Leninist Marxists and their derivatives such as [[Maoism|Maoists]] on the other. In recent history, libertarian socialists have repeatedly formed temporary alliances with [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] groups for the purposes of protest against institutions they both reject. Part of this antagonism can be traced to the [[International Workingmen's Association]], the First International, a congress of [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] workers, where Mikhail Bakunin, who was fairly representative of anarchist views; and [[Karl Marx]], whom anarchists accused of being an "authoritarian", came into conflict on various issues. Bakunin's viewpoint on the illegitimacy of the state as an institution and the role of [[electoral politics]] was starkly counterposed to Marx's views in the First International. Marx and Bakunin's disputes eventually led to Marx taking control of the First International and expelling Bakunin and his followers from the organization. This was the beginning of a long-running feud and schism between libertarian socialists and what they call "authoritarian communists", or alternatively just "authoritarians". Some Marxists have formulated views that closely resemble [[syndicalism]] and thus express more affinity with anarchist ideas. Several libertarian socialists, notably Noam Chomsky, believe that anarchism shares much in common with certain variants of Marxism such as the council communism of Marxist [[Anton Pannekoek]]. In Chomsky's ''[[Notes on Anarchism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Anarchism: From Theory to Practice|date=1970|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=0-85345-128-1|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1970----.htm|authorlink=Noam Chomsky|editor1-last=Guérin |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-link= Daniel Guérin|accessdate=22 May 2014|chapter=Notes on Anarchism}}&lt;/ref&gt; he suggests the possibility "that some form of council communism is the natural form of [[revolutionary socialism]] in an [[industrialization|industrial]] society. It reflects the belief that democracy is severely limited when the industrial system is controlled by any form of autocratic elite, whether of owners, managers, and technocrats, a '[[Vanguard party|vanguard' party]], or a State bureaucracy".

In the mid-20th century, some libertarian socialist groups emerged from disagreements with [[Trotskyism]] which presented itself as Leninist anti-Stalinism. As such, the French group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] emerged from the [[Trotskyist]] [[Fourth International]], where [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] and [[Claude Lefort]] constituted a Chaulieu–Montal tendency in the French [[Internationalist Communist Party|Parti Communiste Internationaliste]] in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their "final disenchantment with Trotskyism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that "the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German "left" of the 1920s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the United Kingdom, the group [[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]] was founded in 1960 by a small group of expelled members of the [[Trotskyist]] [[Socialist Labour League]]. Almost from the start it was strongly influenced by the French Socialisme ou Barbarie group, in particular by its intellectual leader Cornelius Castoriadis, whose essays were among the many pamphlets Solidarity produced. The intellectual leader of the group was [[Chris Pallis]], who wrote under the name Maurice Brinton.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Pallis|Brinton, Maurice]] (Goodway, David ed). ''For Workers' Power: the selected writings of Maurice Brinton''. [[AK Press]]. 2004. {{ISBN|1-904859-07-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) since 1967, the terms [[Ultra-leftism|ultra-left]] and [[Left communism|left communist]] refers to political theory and practice self-defined as further "[[Left-wing politics|left]]" than that of the central Maoist leaders at the height of the GPCR ("[[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]]"). The terms are also used retroactively to describe some early 20th century [[Chinese anarchist]] orientations. As a slur, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has used the term "ultra-left" more broadly to denounce any orientation it considers further "left" than the [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. According to the latter usage, in 1978 the CPC [[Central Committee]] denounced as "ultra-left" the line of [[Mao Zedong]] from 1956 until his death in 1976. "Ultra-left" refers to those GPCR rebel positions that diverged from the central Maoist line by identifying an [[antagonistic contradiction]] between the CPC-PRC [[party-state]] itself and the [[Hoi polloi|masses]] of workers and "peasants"&lt;ref&gt;"Peasant (农民)" was the official term for workers on [[people's commune]]s. According to the Ultra-Left, both peasants and (urban) workers together composed a [[proletarian]] [[Social class|class]] divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution.&lt;/ref&gt; conceived as a single proletarian class divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution. Whereas the central Maoist line maintained that the masses controlled the means of production through the party's mediation, the ultra-left argued that the objective interests of bureaucrats were structurally determined by the centralist state-form in direct opposition to the objective interests of the masses, regardless of however "red" a given bureaucrat's "thought" might be. Whereas the central Maoist leaders encouraged the masses to criticize reactionary "ideas" and "habits" among the alleged 5% of bad cadres, giving them a chance to "turn over a new leaf" after they had undergone "[[Mind control|thought reform]]", the ultra-left argued that "cultural revolution" had to give way to "political revolution" —"in which one class overthrows another class".&lt;ref&gt;See for instance [http://www.marxists.de/china/sheng/whither.htm "Whither China?"] by Yang Xiguang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 70s Collective, ed. 1996. ''China: The Revolution is Dead, Long Live the Revolution''. Montreal: Black Rose Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, French [[platformist]] anarcho-communist [[Daniel Guerin]] published an essay called "Libertarian Marxism?" in which he dealt with the debate between Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin at the First International and afterwards he suggested that "Libertarian marxism rejects determinism and fatalism, giving the greater place to individual will, intuition, imagination, reflex speeds, and to the deep instincts of the masses, which are more far-seeing in hours of crisis than the reasonings of the 'elites'; libertarian marxism thinks of the effects of surprise, provocation and boldness, refuses to be cluttered and paralysed by a heavy 'scientific' apparatus, doesn't equivocate or bluff, and guards itself from adventurism as much as from fear of the unknown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Libertarian_Marxism_.html |title=Libertarian Marxism? by Daniel Guerin |publisher=Theanarchistlibrary.org |date=2011-04-23 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, from 1970 to 1981 there existed the publication ''Root &amp; Branch''&lt;ref&gt;[https://libcom.org/tags/root-branch Root &amp; Branch at libcom.org]&lt;/ref&gt; which had as a subtitle "A Libertarian Marxist Journal".&lt;ref&gt;[https://libcom.org/library/root-branch-7 ''Root &amp; Branch'' # 7 at libcom.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the journal ''[[Libertarian Communism (journal)|Libertarian Communism]]'' was started in the United Kingdom by a group inside the SPGB.&lt;ref&gt;"papers relating to Libertarian Communism (a splinter group of the SPGB) including journals and miscellaneous correspondence, 1970–1980 (1 box)"[[Socialist Party of Great Britain|"Socialist Party of Great Britain" at Archives Hub at the Great Research Centre]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Autonomist Marxism, [[neo-Marxism]] and [[Situationist International|Situationist theory]] are also regarded as being [[anti-authoritarian]] variants of Marxism that are firmly within the libertarian socialist tradition. As such, "[i]n New Zealand, no situationist group was formed, despite the attempts of Grant McDonagh. Instead, McDonagh operated as an individual on the periphery of the anarchist milieu, co-operating with anarchists to publish several magazines, such as Anarchy and KAT. The latter called itself 'an anti-authoritarian spasmodical' of the 'libertarian ultra-left (situationists, anarchists and libertarian socialists)'".&lt;ref&gt;Toby Boraman.

Palgrave Macmillan, December 2012. p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; For libcom.org: "In the 1980s and 90s, a series of other groups developed, influenced also by much of the above work. The most notable are Kolinko, Kurasje and Wildcat in Germany, ''[[Aufheben]]'' in England, Theorie Communiste in France, TPTG in Greece and Kamunist Kranti in India. They are also connected to other groups in other countries, merging autonomia, operaismo, Hegelian Marxism, the work of the JFT, [[Open Marxism]], the ICO, the Situationist International, anarchism and post-68 German Marxism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/libertarian-marxist-tendency-map |title=A libertarian Marxist tendency map|publisher=Libcom.org |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this were intellectuals who were influenced by Italian left communist [[Amadeo Bordiga]], but who disagreed with his Leninist positions and so these included the French publication ''Invariance'' edited by [[Jacques Camatte]], published since 1968 and [[Gilles Dauve]] who published ''Troploin'' with Karl Nesic.

== Notable libertarian socialist tendencies ==
=== Classical anarchist tendencies ===
In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical—those created throughout the 19th century—and post-classical anarchist schools, i.e. those created since the mid-20th century and after.

==== Mutualism ====
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]
Mutualism is a political and economic theory largely associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Proudhon argued that "all capital, whether material or mental, being the result of collective labour, is, in consequence, collective property".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. 'What is Property?'&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that artisans would manage the tools required for their own work while in large-scale enterprises this meant replacing wage labour by workers' co-operatives. He argued "it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers... because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two... castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''The General Idea of the revolution'' Freedom Press (1923)&lt;/ref&gt; As he put it in 1848: "Under the law of association, transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour, so cannot become a cause of inequality.... We are socialists... under universal association, ownership of the land and of the instruments of labour is ''social'' ownership... We want the mines, canals, railways handed over to democratically organised workers' associations... We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies, joined together in the common bond of the democratic and social Republic".&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. 'Oeuvres Complètes' (Lacroix edition), volume 17, pp. 188–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutualists believe that a free labor market would allow for conditions of equal income in proportion to exerted labor.&lt;ref name="Tandy-96 paragraphs"&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10, 15, 19 &amp; 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Meek &amp; Oppenheimer) {{ISBN|1-4196-5869-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Jonathan Beecher puts it, Proudhon's aim was to "emancipate labor from the constraints imposed by capital".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beecher |first=Jonathan F. |title=Victor Considerant and the Rise and Fall of French Romantic Socialism |year=2001 |page=155 |publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-22297-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon supported individual possession of land and argued that the "land is indispensable to our existence, consequently a common thing, consequently insusceptible of appropriation".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He believed that an individual only had a right to land while he was using or occupying it. If the individual ceases doing so, it reverts to unowned land.&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. [http://www.panarchy.org/swartz/mutualism.6.html What is Mutualism? VI. Land and Rent]&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists hold a [[labor theory of value]], arguing that in exchange labor should always be worth "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility"&lt;ref name="Tandy-96 para15"&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and considering anything less to be exploitation, theft of labor, or [[usury]]. Mutualists oppose the institutions by which individuals gain income through loans, investments and rent as they believe the income received through these activities is not in direct accord with labor spent.&lt;ref name="Tandy-96 para19"&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Ricardo, Dobb &amp; Oppenheimer) {{ISBN|1-4196-5869-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In place of these capitalist institutions, they advocate [[Worker cooperative|labor-owned cooperative firms]] and associations.&lt;ref&gt;Hymans, E., ''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', pp. 190–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, pp. 110, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists advocate mutual banks, owned by the workers, that do not charge interest on secured loans. Most mutualists believe that anarchy should be achieved gradually rather than through revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutualist.org/ Free Market Anti-Capitalism]. Mutualist.Org. Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[individualist anarchists]], such as Benjamin Tucker, were influenced by Proudhon's mutualism, but they did not call for "association" in large enterprises like him.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutualist ideas found a fertile ground in the 19th century in Spain. In Spain, [[Ramón de la Sagra]] established anarchist journal ''El Porvenir'' in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon's ideas.&lt;ref name="britannica.com Spain"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22753/anarchism/66525/Anarchism-in-Spain#ref539322 "Anarchism" at the ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]'' online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Catalan politician [[Francesc Pi i Margall]] became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: a history of libertarian movements''. p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to George Woodcock, "[t]hese translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; According to the ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]'': "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralized, or "[[Cantonalism|cantonalist]]", political system on Proudhonian lines".&lt;ref name="britannica.com Spain"/&gt; [[Kevin Carson]] is a contemporary mutualist theorist who is the author of ''[[Studies in Mutualist Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Carson]].

==== Collectivist anarchism ====
{{main|Collectivist anarchism}}
[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|left|upright|Mikhail Bakunin]]
Collectivist anarchism (also known as anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. Marx in Context. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; doctrine that advocates the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]] and private ownership of the [[means of production]]. Instead, it envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers would revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref&gt;Bakunin Mikail. Bakunin on Anarchism. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with anarcho-communism where wages would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods "to each according to his need". Notwithstanding the title, Bakunin's collectivist anarchism is thus seen as a blend of individualism and [[collectivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Morriss, Brian. Bakukunin: The Philosophy of Freedom. Black Rose Books Ltd., 1993. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin, the anti-authoritarian sections of the [[First International]]; and the early [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist movement]].

==== Anarcho-communism ====

Anarcho-communism (also known as anarchist communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state, markets, money, capitalism and private property (while retaining respect for [[personal property]])&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"&gt;"The revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business.

To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e. established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon) are the anarchist territories during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]]&lt;ref&gt;"This process of education and class organization, more than any single factor in Spain, produced the collectives. And to the degree that the CNT-FAI (for the two organizations became fatally coupled after July 1936) exercised the major influence in an area, the collectives proved to be generally more durable, communist and resistant to Stalinist counterrevolution than other republican-held areas of Spain". Murray Bookchin.

Through the efforts and influence of the [[Spanish anarchists]] during the Spanish Revolution within the [[Spanish Civil War]], starting in 1936 anarcho-communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia and in the stronghold of [[anarchist Catalonia]] before being crushed by the combined forces of [[Francoism]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Communist Party of Spain]] repression (backed by the [[Soviet Union]]) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the [[Spanish Republic]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin.

During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as [[Nestor Makhno]] worked to create and defend—through the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]—anarcho-communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921. Anarcho-communist currents include [[platformism]] and insurrectionary anarchism.

==== Within individualist anarchism ====
{{main|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and his or her [[will (philosophy)|will]] over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems.&lt;ref name="ryner"&gt;"What do I mean by individualism? I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience."[https://web.archive.org/web/20171017134540/https://www.marxists.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tucker"&gt;"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.""Anarchism and the State" in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt;

While not against the market and property he was firmly against capitalism as it was, in his eyes, a state-supported monopoly of social capital (tools, machinery, etc.) which allows owners to exploit their employees, i.e., to avoid paying workers the full value of their labour. He thought that the "labouring classes are deprived of their earnings by usury in its three forms, interest, rent and profit", therefore "''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' will abolish interest; it will abolish profit; it will abolish monopolistic rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish the exploitation of labour; it will abolish all means whereby any labourer can be deprived of any of his product". This stance puts him squarely in the libertarian socialist tradition and Tucker referred to himself many times as a socialist and considered his philosophy to be "Anarchistic socialism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG5 "Benjamin Tucker: Capitalist or Anarchist"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107013451/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG5 |date=2012-01-07 }} in ''An Anarchist FAQ'' by Various Authors&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The economic principles of Modern Socialism are a logical deduction from the principle laid down by Adam Smith in the early chapters of his "Wealth of Nations," – namely, that labor is the true measure of price...Half a century or more after Smith enunciated the principle above stated, Socialism picked it up where he had dropped it, and in following it to its logical conclusions, made it the basis of a new economic philosophy...This seems to have been done independently by three different men, of three different nationalities, in three different languages: Josiah Warren, an American; Pierre J. Proudhon, a Frenchman; Karl Marx, a German Jew...That the work of this interesting trio should have been done so nearly simultaneously would seem to indicate that Socialism was in the air, and that the time was ripe and the conditions favorable for the appearance of this new school of thought...So far as priority of time is concerned, the credit seems to belong to Warren, the American, – a fact which should be noted by the stump orators who are so fond of declaiming against Socialism as an imported article."

[[File:Oscar Wilde portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Oscar Wilde]], famous [[Anarchism in Ireland|anarchist Irish]] writer who published the libertarian socialist work titled ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'']]
[[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Émile Armand]] shows clearly opposition to capitalism and centralized economies when he said that the individualist anarchist "inwardly he remains refractory – fatally refractory – morally, intellectually, economically (The capitalist economy and the directed economy, the speculators and the fabricators of single are equally repugnant to him.)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/library/emile-armand/life-activity.html |title="Anarchist Individualism as a Life and Activity" by Emile Armand |publisher=Spaz.org |date=March 1, 2002 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish individualist anarchist [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] thought that "capitalism is an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it [[State capitalism]] or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State".&lt;ref&gt;"el capitalismo es sólo el efecto del gobierno; desaparecido el gobierno, el capitalismo cae de su pedestal vertiginosamente.... Lo que llamamos capitalismo no es otra cosa que el producto del Estado, dentro del cual lo único que se cultiva es la ganancia, bien o mal habida. Luchar, pues, contra el capitalismo es tarea inútil, porque sea Capitalismo de Estado o Capitalismo de Empresa, mientras el Gobierno exista, existirá el capital que explota. La lucha, pero de conciencias, es contra el Estado."[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt; His view on class division and [[technocracy]] are as follows: "Since when no one works for another, the profiteer from wealth disappears, just as government will disappear when no one pays attention to those who learned four things at universities and from that fact they pretend to govern men. Big industrial enterprises will be transformed by men in big associations in which everyone will work and enjoy the product of their work. And from those easy as well as beautiful problems anarchism deals with and he who puts them in practice and lives them are anarchists.... The priority which without rest an anarchist must make is that in which no one has to exploit anyone, no man to no man, since that non-exploitation will lead to the limitation of property to individual needs".&lt;ref&gt;"¿La propiedad? ¡Bah! No es problema. Porque cuando nadie trabaje para nadie, el acaparador de la riqueza desaparece, como ha de desaparecer el gobierno cuando nadie haga caso a los que aprendieron cuatro cosas en las universidades y por ese sólo hecho pretenden gobernar a los hombres. Porque si en la tierra de los ciegos el tuerto es rey, en donde todos ven y juzgan y disciernen, el rey estorba. Y de lo que se trata es de que no haya reyes porque todos sean hombres. Las grandes empresas industriales las transformarán los hombres en grandes asociaciones donde todos trabajen y disfruten del producto de su trabajo. Y de esos tan sencillos como hermosos problemas trata el anarquismo y al que lo cumple y vive es al que se le llama anarquista...El hincapié que sin cansancio debe hacer el anarquista es el de que nadie debe explotar a nadie, ningún hombre a ningún hombre, porque esa no-explotación llevaría consigo la limitación de la propiedad a las necesidades individuales."[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt;

The anarchist&lt;ref&gt;"The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]''. Wilde, as we have seen, declared himself an anarchist on at least one occasion during the 1890s, and he greatly admired [[Kropotkin]], whom he had met. Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one "of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience" and talked of him as "a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia." But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is [[William Godwin|Godwin]] rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant." George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962. (p. 447)&lt;/ref&gt; writer and [[bohemianism|Bohemian]] [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote in his famous essay ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' that "[a]rt is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/hist_texts/wilde_soul.html |title=The soul of man under Socialism by Oscar Wilde |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |accessdate=2013-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914032335/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/hist_texts/wilde_soul.html |archivedate=2013-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchist historian George Woodcock, "Wilde's aim in ''The Soul of Man under Socialism'' is to seek the society most favorable to the artist... for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated.... Wilde represents the anarchist as [[aesthete]]".&lt;ref&gt;George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962. (p. 447)&lt;/ref&gt; In a socialist society, people will have the possibility to realise their talents as "each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society". Wilde added that "upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments "armed with economic power as they are now with political power" over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism, saying that "of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type" a critique which is "quite true".&lt;ref name="The Soul of Man"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/soul-of-man-under-socialism-oscar-wilde |title=The Soul of Man |publisher=Libcom.org |date=2005-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Wilde's imagination, in this way socialism would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul. He ended by declaring: "The new individualism is the new hellenism".&lt;ref name="The Soul of Man"/&gt;

==== Anarcho-syndicalism ====
{{main|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
[[File:Manifestación CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|[[International Workers' Day|May Day]] demonstration of Spanish anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in [[Bilbao]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] in 2010]]
Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the [[labor union|labor movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Sorel, Georges. 'Political Theorists in Context' Routledge (2004) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-syndicalists view [[trade union|labor unions]] as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers.

The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[Wiktionary:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[direct action]] and [[workers' self-management]]. Workers' solidarity means that anarcho-syndicalists believe all workers—no matter their race, gender, or ethnic group—are in a similar situation in regard to their [[Wiktionary:Boss|boss]] ([[class consciousness]]). Furthermore, it means that within capitalism any gains or losses made by some workers from or to bosses would eventually affect all workers. Therefore, to [[Wiktionary:Liberate|liberate]] themselves all workers must support one another in their [[class conflict]]. Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which in anarcho-syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.

Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The [[International Workers Association]] (IWA) is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries. The Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labor movement. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

=== Libertarian Marxist tendencies ===
{{main|Libertarian Marxism}}
Libertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the anti-authoritarian aspects of [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Outside and against this process of turning of Marxism into an ideology of domination, however, were various revolutionary tendencies which still drew on Marx's work to inform their struggles and which rejected both social- democratic and [[Marxist-Leninist]] versions of his theory. The most interesting of these, those that are relevant to my current purpose, have been those which insisted on the primacy of the self-activity and creativity of people in struggle against capitalism. Within the space of these tendencies there has developed a coherent critique of "orthodox Marxism" that includes not only a rejection of the concept of "the transition" but a reconceptualization of the process of transcending capitalism that has remarkable similarities to Kropotkin's thinking on this subject. ... Thus one of the earliest political tendencies within which this approach appeared after the Russian revolution of 1917 was that of "[[Council Communism]]" which saw the "workers councils" in Germany (see [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]), or the [[soviets]] in Russia, as new organizational forms constructed by the people. As with the anarchists, they too saw the Bolshevik take-over of the soviets (like that of the trade unions) as subverting the revolution and beginning the restoration of domination and exploitation. ... Over the years this emphasis on working class autonomy has resulted in a reinterpretation of Marxist theory that has brought out the two-sided character of the class struggle and shifted the focus from capital (the preoccupation of orthodox Marxism) to the workers. ... As a result, not only has there been a recognition that capitalism seeks to subordinate everyone's life (from the traditional factory proletariat to peasants, housewives and students) but that all those peoples' struggles involve both the resistance to this subordination and the effort to construct alternative ways of being."[[Harry Cleaver|Cleaver, Harry]].

De Leonism, occasionally known as Marxism–De Leonism, is a form of [[syndicalist]] Marxism developed by [[Daniel De Leon]]. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]] (SLP). De Leon combined the rising theories of syndicalism in his time with [[orthodox Marxism]]. According to De Leonist theory, militant [[industrial unions]] (specialized trade unions) are the vehicle of [[class struggle]]. Industrial unions serving the interests of the [[proletariat]] will bring about the change needed to establish a socialist system. The only way this differs from some currents in anarcho-syndicalism is that according to De Leonist thinking a revolutionary political party is also necessary to fight for the proletariat on the political field. De Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. It predates Leninism as De Leonism's principles developed in the early 1890s with De Leon's assuming leadership of the SLP whereas Leninism and its [[vanguard party]] idea took shape after the 1902 publication of Lenin's ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]''. The highly [[decentralized]] and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the [[democratic centralism]] of Marxism–Leninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and other [[communist state]]s. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out the revolution.

==== Council communism ====
{{main|Council Communism}}
&lt;!-- [[File:Antonie Pannekoek.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Antonie Pannekoek, one of the main theorists of council communism]] --&gt;
Council communism was a radical left-wing movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD). Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within Marxism and also within libertarian socialism. In contrast to those of social democracy and Leninist communism, the central argument of council communism is that [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural and legitimate form of [[working class]] organisation and government power. This view is opposed to the reformist and [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] stress on [[Vanguardism|vanguard parties]], parliaments, or the state. The core principle of council communism is that the state and the economy should be managed by [[workers' councils]], composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose state-run "bureaucratic socialism". They also oppose the idea of a "revolutionary party" since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party [[dictatorship]]. Council communists support a workers' democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.

The Russian word for council is "[[Soviet (council)|soviet]]" and during the early years of the revolution worker's councils were politically significant in Russia. It was to take advantage of the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of workplace power that the word became used by [[Vladimir Lenin]] for various political organs. Indeed, the name "[[Supreme Soviet]]", by which the parliament was called; and that of the Soviet Union itself make use of this terminology, but they do not imply any decentralization. Furthermore, council communists held a critique of the Soviet Union as a capitalist state, believing that the Bolshevik revolution in Russia became a "[[bourgeois]] revolution" when a party bureaucracy replaced the old [[feudal]] [[aristocracy]]. Although most felt the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] was working class in character, they believed that since capitalist relations still existed (because the workers had no say in running the economy), the Soviet Union ended up as a [[state capitalist]] country, with the state replacing the individual capitalist. Council communists thus support workers' revolutions, but oppose one-party dictatorships. Council communists also believed in diminishing the role of the party to one of [[agitprop|agitation]] and [[propaganda]], rejected all participation in elections or parliament and argued that workers should leave the reactionary trade unions and form one big revolutionary union.

==== Left communism ====
{{main|Left communism}}
{{Left communism sidebar|Related}}
Left communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks at certain periods, from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the [[Communist International]] after its first and during its second congress. Left communists see themselves to the left of Leninists (whom they tend to see as "left of capital", not socialists), anarchists (some of whom they consider internationalist socialists) as well as some other revolutionary socialist tendencies (for example [[De Leonism|De Leonists]], who they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances). Although she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has heavily influenced most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included Amadeo Bordiga, [[Herman Gorter]], Anton Pannekoek, [[Otto Rühle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Paul Mattick]].

Prominent [[list of left communist internationals|left communist groups existing today]] include the [[International Communist Current]] and the [[International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party]]. Different factions from the old Bordigist [[International Communist Party]] are also considered left communist organizations.

==== Johnson–Forest tendency ====
{{main|Johnson–Forest tendency}}
The Johnson–Forest tendency, sometimes called the Johnsonites, refers to a radical left tendency in the United States associated with Marxist theorists [[C. L. R. James|C.L.R. James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], who used the pseudonyms J. R. Johnson and Freddie Forest respectively. They were joined by [[Grace Lee Boggs]], a Chinese American woman who was considered the third founder. After leaving the trotskist [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], Johnson–Forest founded their own organization for the first time, called Correspondence. This group changed its named to the [[Correspondence Publishing Committee]] the next year.  However, tensions that had surfaced earlier presaged a split, which took place in 1955. Through his theoretical and political work of the late 1940s, James had concluded that a vanguard party was no longer necessary because its teachings had been absorbed in the masses. In 1956, James would see the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] as confirmation of this. Those who endorsed the politics of James took the name [[Facing Reality]] after the 1958 book by James co-written with Grace Lee Boggs and Pierre Chaulieu (a pseudonym for [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]) on the Hungarian working class revolt of 1956.

==== Socialisme ou Barbarie ====
{{main|Socialisme ou Barbarie}}
[[File:Cornelius Castoriadis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Cornelius Castoriadis]], libertarian socialist theorist]]
Socialisme ou Barbarie ("Socialism or Barbarism") was a French-based radical libertarian socialist group of the post-[[World War II]] period (the name comes from a phrase Friedrich Engels used and was cited by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] in the 1916 essay ''The Junius Pamphlet'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg: The Junius Pamphlet (Chap.1) |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It existed from 1948 until 1965. The animating personality was [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], also known as Pierre Chaulieu or Paul Cardan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dick Howard | title=Introduction to Castoriadis | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23 | page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he explicitly both rejected Leninist vanguardism and criticised spontaneism, for Castoriadis "the emancipation of the mass of people was the task of those people; however, the socialist thinker could not simply fold his or her arms". Castoriadis argued that the special place accorded to the intellectual should belong to each autonomous citizen. However, he rejected ''attentisme'', maintaining that in the struggle for a new society intellectuals needed to "place themselves at a distance from the everyday and from the real".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt; Political philosopher [[Claude Lefort]] was impressed by Cornelius Castoriadis when he first met him. They published ''On the Regime and Against the Defence of the USSR'', a critique of both the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] supporters. They suggested that the Soviet Union was dominated by a social layer of bureaucrats and that it consisted of a new kind of society as aggressive as Western European societies. Later, he also published in ''Socialisme ou Barbarie''.

==== Situationist International ====
{{main|Situationist International}}
The Situationist International was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957 and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented [[general strike|general]] [[wildcat strikes]] of [[May 1968 in France]].

With their ideas rooted in Marxism and the 20th century European artistic [[avant-garde]]s, they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the capitalist order, for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose, they suggested and experimented with the "construction of situations", namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]]. In this vein, a major theorectical work which emerged from this group was [[Raoul Vaneigem]]'s ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raoul Vaneigem]]. [http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/raoul-vaneigem-the-revolution-of-everyday-life '[The Revolution of Everyday Life''].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Situationists|Related}}
They fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in [[advanced capitalism]]. Their critical theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]]. Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like [[mass media]] and advertising have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. To overthrow such a system, the Situationist International supported the May 1968 revolts and asked the workers to [[Council for Maintaining the Occupations|occupy the factories]] and to run them with direct democracy through [[workers' councils]] composed by instantly revocable delegates.

After publishing in the last issue of the magazine an analysis of the May 1968 revolts and the strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions,&lt;ref name="SI12BeginningOfAnEra"&gt;''The Beginning of an Era'' ([http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm part1], [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era2.htm part 2]) Situationist International #12, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; the SI was dissolved in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Situationism in a nutshell | author=Karen Elliot | url=http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000011.shtml | publisher=Barbelith Webzine | date=June 1, 2001 | accessdate=June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Autonomism ====
{{main|Autonomism}}
[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|thumb|upright|Antonio Negri, main theorist of Italian autonomism]]
Autonomism refers to a set of left-wing political and social movements and theories close to the socialist movement. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency|Johnson–Forest tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]. Later, post-Marxist and anarchist tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian far-left movements in the 1970s and the emergence of a number of important theorists including Antonio Negri, who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'' as well as [[Mario Tronti]], [[Paolo Virno]] and [[Franco Berardi|Franco "Bifo" Berardi]].

Unlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a "bottom up" theory which draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working and socialization in the workplace.

All this influenced the German and Dutch autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]] and today is influential in Italy, France and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The autonomist Marxist and autonomen movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English-speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as autonomists. The Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]]. Today, it is associated also with the publication ''[[Multitudes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multitudes.samizdat.net/ Webpage of ''[[Multitudes]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pi y margal 1869.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Francesc Pi i Margall]], [[Catalan people|Catalan]] follower and translator of Proudhon and libertarian socialist theorist who briefly became [[President of Spain]]]]
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon ran for the French [[constituent assembly]] in April 1848, but he was not elected although his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besançon and Lille. He was successful in the complementary elections of June 4. The Catalan politician [[Francesc Pi i Margall]] became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party.

On the other hand, [[Fermín Salvochea]] was a mayor of the city of [[Cádiz]] and a president of the [[Cádiz (province)|province of Cádiz]].

[[Libertarian possibilism]] was a political current within the early 20th-century Spanish anarchist movement which advocated achieving the anarchist ends of ending the state and capitalism with participation inside structures of contemporary parliamentary democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus Ruiz. ''Posibilismo libertario. Felix Morga, Alcalde de Najera (1891–1936)''.

Lorenzo. ''Les Anarchistes espagnols et le pouvoir. 1868–1969''. Éditions du Seuil. 1969. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; During the autumn of 1931, the "Manifesto of the 30" was published by militants of the anarchist trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT). Among those who signed it there was the CNT General Secretary (1922–1923) Joan Peiro, [[Angel Pestaña]] (General Secretary in 1929) and Juan Lopez Sanchez. Their current was called ''treintismo'' and they called for a more moderate political line within the Spanish anarchist movement. In 1932, they established the [[Syndicalist Party]] which participated in the [[Spanish general election, 1936|1936 Spanish general election]] and proceeded to be a part of the leftist coalition of parties known as the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]], obtaining two congressmen (Pestaña and Benito Pabon). In 1938, Horacio Prieto, general secretary of the CNT, proposed that the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]] transform itself into a libertarian socialist party and that it participate in national elections.&lt;ref name=Renof&gt;Israël Renof, ''Possibilisme libertaire'', [[Noir et Rouge]], n°41, mai 1968, pp. 16–23, [http://archivesautonomies.org/IMG/pdf/anarchismes/noiretrouge/NR-n41.pdf lire en ligne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311055515/http://archivesautonomies.org/IMG/pdf/anarchismes/noiretrouge/NR-n41.pdf |date=2016-03-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1936, the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front government]] appointed the prominent anarcha-feminist [[Federica Montseny]] as Minister of Health.

In 1950, a clandestine group formed within the Francophone [[Anarchist Federation (France)|Anarchist Federation]] (FA) called Organisation Pensée Bataille (OPB) led by the [[Platformism|platformist]] George Fontenis.&lt;ref name="public.federation-anarchiste.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014916/http://public.federation-anarchiste.org/IMG/pdf/Cedric_Guerin_Histoire_du_mvt_libertaire_1950_1970.pdf Cédric Guerin. "Pensée et action des anarchistes en France : 1950–1970"]&lt;/ref&gt; The OPB pushed for a move which saw the FA change its name into the Fédération Communiste Libertaire (FCL) after the 1953 Congress in Paris while an article in ''Le Libertaire'' indicated the end of the cooperation with the French [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] Group led by André Breton. The new decision-making process was founded on [[unanimity]], as each person had a right of veto on the orientations of the federation. The FCL published the same year the ''Manifeste du communisme libertaire''. Several groups quit the FCL in December 1955, disagreeing with the decision to present "revolutionary candidates" at the legislative elections. On 15–20 August 1954, the 5th intercontinental plenum of the CNT took place. A group called Entente anarchiste (Anarchist Agreement) appeared, which was formed of militants who did not like the new ideological orientation that the OPB was giving the FCL, considering it authoritarian and almost Marxist.&lt;ref&gt;''"Si la critique de la déviation autoritaire de la FA est le principal fait de ralliement, on peut ressentir dès le premier numéro un état d'esprit qui va longtemps coller à la peau des anarchistes français. Cet état d'esprit se caractérise ainsi sous une double forme : d'une part un rejet inconditionnel de l'ennemi marxiste, d'autre part des questions sur le rôle des anciens et de l'évolution idéologique de l'anarchisme. C'est Fernand Robert qui attaque le premier : "Le LIB est devenu un journal marxiste. En continuant à le soutenir, tout en reconnaissant qu'il ne nous plaît pas, vous faîtes une mauvaise action contre votre idéal anarchiste. Vous donnez la main à vos ennemis dans la pensée. Même si la FA disparaît, même si le LIB disparaît, l'anarchie y gagnera. Le marxisme ne représente plus rien. Il faut le mettre bas ; je pense la même chose des dirigeants actuels de la FA.

There was a strong left-libertarian current in the British labour movement and the term "libertarian socialist" has been applied to a number of [[democratic socialist]]s, including some prominent members of the [[British Labour Party]]. The [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] was formed in 1885 by [[William Morris]] and others critical of the authoritarian socialism of the [[Social Democratic Federation]]. It was involved in the [[New Unionism]], the rank-and-file union militancy of the 1880s–1890s, which anticipated syndicalism in some key ways ([[Tom Mann]], a New Unionist leader, was one of the first British syndicalists). The Socialist League was dominated by anarchists by the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Quail |title=The Slow-Burning Fuse |publisher= Paladin |date= 1978 |ISBN=0-586-08225-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) formed at that time drew more on the [[nonconformist]] religious traditions in the British working class than on Marxist theory and had a libertarian socialist strain. Others in the tradition of the ILP and described as libertarian socialists included [[Michael Foot]] and most importantly, [[G. D. H. Cole]]. Labour Party minister [[Peter Hain]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.chartist.org.uk/articles/britpol/july_hain.html "Rediscovering our libertarian roots" by Peter Hain]&lt;/ref&gt; has written in support of libertarian socialism, identifying an axis involving a "bottom-up vision of socialism, with anarchists at the [[revolutionary]] end and democratic socialists [such as himself] at its [[reformism|reformist]] end" as opposed to the axis of [[state socialism]] with Marxist–Leninists at the revolutionary end and social democrats at the reformist end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hain |first=Peter |title=Ayes to the Left: A Future for Socialism |year=1995 |publisher=Lawrence and Wishart|isbn=978-0-85315-832-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent mainstream Labour politician who has been described as a libertarian socialist is [[Robin Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]] said in 2005 that in recent years Cook had been setting out a vision of "libertarian, democratic socialism that was beginning to break the sometimes sterile boundaries of 'old' and 'New' Labour labels.".{{cite news |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article304442.ece |title=Chris Smith: The House of Commons was Robin Cook's true home – Commentators, Opinion – Independent.co.uk |publisher=Comment.independent.co.uk |date=2005-08-08 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930170828/http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article304442.ece |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Defined in this way, libertarian socialism in the contemporary political mainstream is distinguished from modern social democracy and democratic socialism principally by its political decentralism rather than by its economics.

Negative freedom is according to Halsema the freedom citizens from government influence; she applies this concept especially to the multicultural society and the rechtsstaat, where the government should protect the rights of citizens and not limit them.

In the Spanish autonomous community of [[Catalonia]], ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' reports about the contemporary political party [[Popular Unity Candidacy|Candidatura d'Unitat Popular]] (or CUP) that:
{{quote|A libertarian socialist and even anarcho-syndicalist character permeates CUP, in the anti-authoritarian tradition of the Catalan left — embodied by Civil War-era organizations like the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT), which was anarcho-syndicalist, or Trotskyists like [[Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista]] (POUM). [...] cooperatives and popular cultural centers (''casals'' and ''ateneus populars'') flourished in the late 1990s and 2000s as safe havens for radical socialist communities, economic alternatives, and ideological formations. Many revolutionary youth organizations were born in these cultural centers. [...] In addition to the network of popular cultural centers, the emergence of squatted houses — also known as "self-managed social centers" — further extended this radical sensibility in Catalonia. While not all squatted houses are aligned with separatist socialism, some of the most emblematic houses are more identified with the separatist movement, like the squatted house of [[Can Vies]] in Barcelona. [...] Every local assembly represents the essential unit of this popular unity. It represents the neighborhood, the village, the town. [...] Assemblies are sovereign and potentially powerful. They are the cradle of participatory democracy. In some of the towns where CUP holds the power, these open assemblies have received extra responsibilities and "devolved" powers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2015/10/catalan-referendum-spain-podemos-independence |title=The Catalan Left: An interview with Boaz Vilallonga |newspaper= [[Jacobin Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Georgism ====
{{main|Georgism|Henry George}}
Georgism (also called Geoism or Geonomics) is an [[Economics|economic philosophy]] and [[ideology]] which holds that people own what they create, but that things found in nature, most importantly [[land (economics)|land]], belong equally to all.&lt;ref name=Heavey&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heavey  |first=Jerome F. |title=Comments on Warren Samuels' "Why the Georgist movement has not succeeded" |journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology |date=July 2003  |volume=62 |series= |issue=3 |pages=593–99 |jstor=3487813 |quote=human beings have an inalienable right to the product of their own labor |doi=10.1111/1536-7150.00230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgist philosophy is based on the writings of the economist [[Henry George]] (1839–1897) and is usually associated with the idea of a [[single tax]] on the value of land. His most famous work, ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' (1879), is a treatise on inequality, the [[business cycle|cyclic nature]] of [[industrialized country|industrialized economies]] and the use of the land value tax as a remedy. Georgists argue that a [[Land value tax|tax on land value]] is [[Economic efficiency|economically efficient]], [[Justice|fair]] and [[Equity (economics)|equitable]]; and that it can generate sufficient revenue so that other taxes (e.g. taxes on profits, sales or income), which are less fair and efficient, can be reduced or eliminated. A tax on land value has been described by many as a [[Progressive taxation|progressive tax]] since it would be [[tax burden|paid]] primarily by the wealthy and would reduce [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref name="McCluskey and Franzsen"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jkogP2U4k0AC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=disadvantages+of+land+value+taxation#PPA4,M1 |title=Land Value Taxation: An Applied Analysis, William J.

Georgist ideas heavily influenced the politics of the early 20th century. Political parties that were formed based on Georgist ideas include the [[Commonwealth Land Party (United States)|Commonwealth Land Party]], the [[Justice Party of Denmark]], the [[Henry George Justice Party]] and the [[Single Tax League]]. Several communities were also initiated with Georgist principles during the height of the philosophy's popularity. Two such communities that still exist are [[Arden, Delaware]], which was founded in 1900 by [[George Francis Stephens|Frank Stephens]] and [[Will Price]]; and [[Fairhope, Alabama]], which was founded in 1894 by the auspices of the [[Fairhope Single Tax Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairhopesingletax.com |title=Fairhope Single Tax Corporation |publisher=Fairhopesingletax.com |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy was enthused by the economic thinking of Henry George, incorporating it approvingly into later works such as ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'', the book that played a major factor in his [[excommunication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Wenzer |first= Kenneth C. |year= 1997 |title= Tolstoy's Georgist Spiritual Political Economy (1897–1910): Anarchism and Land Reform |journal= [[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]] |volume= 56 |issue= 4, Oct |jstor= 3487337 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Guild socialism ====
{{main|Guild socialism}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:George-douglas-howard-cole.jpg|thumb|left|G. D. H. Cole, theorist of guild socialism]] --&gt;
Guild socialism is a political movement advocating [[workers' control]] of industry through the medium of trade-related [[guilds]] "in an implied contractual relationship with the public".&lt;ref name="britannica.com Guild Socialism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/248652/Guild-Socialism |title="Guild Socialism". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 31 May. 2012 |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originated in the United Kingdom and was at its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="britannica.com Guild Socialism"/&gt; It was strongly associated with G. D. H. Cole and influenced by the ideas of [[William Morris]].

Guild socialism was partly inspired by the guilds of [[artisan|craftsmen]] and other skilled workers which had existed in [[England in the Middle Ages|England during the Middle Ages]]. In 1906, [[Arthur Penty]] published ''Restoration of the Gild System'' in which he opposed factory production and advocated a return to an earlier period of artisanal production organised through guilds. The following year, the journal ''[[The New Age]]'' became an advocate of guild socialism, although in the context of modern industry rather than the medieval setting favoured by Penty. The guild socialists "stood for state ownership of industry, combined with "workers' control" through delegation of authority to national guilds organized internally on democratic lines. About the state itself they differed, some believing it would remain more or less in its existing form and others that it would be transformed into a federal body representing the workers' guilds, consumers' organizations, local government bodies, and other social structures".&lt;ref name="britannica.com Guild Socialism"/&gt; In 1914, [[Samuel George Hobson|S. G. Hobson]], a leading contributor to ''The New Age'', published ''National Guilds: An Inquiry into the Wage System and the Way Out''. In this work, guilds were presented as an alternative to state-control of industry or conventional trade union activity. Unlike the existing trade unions, guilds would not confine their demands to matters of wages and conditions, but would seek to obtain control of industry for the workers whom they represented. Ultimately, industrial guilds would serve as the organs through which industry would be organised in a future socialist society. The theory of guild socialism was developed and popularised by G. D. H. Cole who formed the National Guilds League in 1915 and published several books on guild socialism, including ''Self-Government in Industry'' (1917) and ''Guild Socialism Restated'' (1920). For scholar Charles Masquerade, "[i]t is by meeting such a twofold requirement that the libertarian socialism of G.D.H. Cole could be said to offer timely and sustainable avenues for the institutionalization of the liberal value of autonomy...By setting out to 'destroy this predominance of economic factors' (Cole 1980, 180) through the re-organization of key spheres of life into forms of associative action and coordination capable of giving the 'fullest development of functional organisation'...Cole effectively sought to turn political representation into a system actually capable of giving direct recognition to the multiplicity of interests making up highly complex and differentiated societies".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Masquelier.

==== Revolutionary syndicalism ====
{{main|Revolutionary syndicalism}}
{{Syndicalism sidebar}}
Revolutionary syndicalism is a type of [[economic system]] proposed as a replacement for capitalism and an alternative to [[state socialism]], which uses federations of collectivised [[trade unions]] or [[industrial unions]]. It is a form of socialist economic [[corporatism]] that advocates interest aggregation of multiple non-competitive categorised units to negotiate and manage an economy.&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J. ''Corporatism and comparative politics''. M.E. Sharpe, 1996. pp. 65–66, 156.&lt;/ref&gt; For adherents, labour unions are the potential means of both overcoming economic aristocracy and running [[society]] fairly in the interest of the majority through [[union democracy]]. Industry in a syndicalist system would be run through [[co-operative economics|co-operative]] confederations and [[Mutual aid (politics)|mutual aid]]. Local syndicates would communicate with other syndicates through the [[Bourse du Travail]] (labor exchange) which would manage and transfer [[Commodity|commodities]].

Syndicalism is also used to refer to the tactic of bringing about this social arrangement, typically expounded by anarcho-syndicalism and [[De Leonism]] in which a general strike begins and workers seize their means of production and organise in a federation of trade unionism, such as the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT).&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Syndcicalism'', Brown, Tom. Retrieved July 6, 2010: http://libcom.org/library/principles-of-syndicalism-tom-brown&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its history, the reformist section of syndicalism has been overshadowed by its revolutionary section, typified by the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] in [[France]], the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] section of the CNT.,&lt;ref&gt;info on the FAI http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/f/10748453.php&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana]] and the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]].

==== Christian anarchism ====
{{main|Christian anarchism}}
[[File:Leo Tolstoy, portrait.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Leo Tolstoy, important theorist of [[Christian anarchism]] and anarcho-pacifism]]
Christian anarchism is a [[Christian movement|movement]] in [[political theology]] that combines anarchism and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Christoyannopoulos, pp. 2–4: "Locating Christian anarchism.... In political theology"&lt;/ref&gt; It is the belief that there is only one source of authority to which Christians are ultimately answerable, the authority of God as embodied in the teachings of Jesus. More than any other Bible source, the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and Jesus' call to not resist evil but [[turning the other cheek|turn the other cheek]], are used as the basis for Christian anarchism.&lt;ref name=Sermon&gt;Christoyannopoulos, pp. 43–80: "The Sermon on the Mount: A manifesto for Christian anarchism"&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian anarchists are [[Christian pacifism|pacifists]] and oppose the use of violence, such as war.&lt;ref name=CritiqueofViolence&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/alexpaper.pdf |title=A Christian Anarchist Critique of Violence: From Turning the Other Cheek to a Rejection of the State |first=Alexandre |last=Christoyannopoulos |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |date=12 March 2010 |conference=Evil, Law, and the State |location=Salzburg |accessdate=23 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523064356/http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/alexpaper.pdf |archive-date=2014-05-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of Christian anarchism is a rejection of violence, with Leo Tolstoy's ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' regarded as a key text.&lt;ref name=CritiqueofViolence /&gt;&lt;ref name=tolstoy&gt;Christoyannopoulos, pp. 19 and 208: "Leo Tolstoy"&lt;/ref&gt; Christian anarchists denounce the state as they claim it is violent, deceitful and when glorified a form of [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name=CritiqueofViolence /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christoyannopoulos, p. 254: "The state as idolatry"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tolstoyanism|Tolstoyans]] were a small Christian anarchist group formed by Tolstoy's companion [[Vladimir Chertkov]] (1854–1936) to spread Tolstoy's religious teachings. Prince Peter Kropotkin wrote of Tolstoy in the article on anarchism in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] while in hundreds of essays over the last twenty years of his life Tolstoy reiterated the anarchist critique of the state and recommended books by Kropotkin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to his readers whilst rejecting anarchism's espousal of [[propaganda of the deed|violent revolutionary means]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 1900 essay, "On Anarchy", he wrote; "The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be instituted by a revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power ... There can be only one permanent revolution – a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man." Despite his misgivings about [[anarchist violence]], Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of [[anarchism in Russia|anarchist thinkers in Russia]], and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin's "Words of a Rebel", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.

==== Gandhism ====
{{main|Gandhism|Gandhian economics|Gandhian socialism}}
Gandhism is the collection of inspirations, principles, beliefs and philosophy of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi), who was a major political leader of India and the [[Indian independence movement]]. It is a body of ideas and principles that describes the inspiration, vision and the life work of Gandhi. It is particularly associated with his contributions to the idea and practice of [[nonviolent resistance]], sometimes also called [[civil resistance]]. [[Gandhian economics]] are the socio-economic principles expounded by Gandhi. It is largely characterised by its affinity to the principles and objectives of nonviolent humanistic socialism, but with a rejection of violent [[class conflict|class war]] and promotion of socio-economic harmony. Gandhi's economic ideas also aim to promote spiritual development and harmony with a rejection of [[materialism]]. The term "Gandhian economics" was coined by [[J. C. Kumarappa]], a close supporter of Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kumarappa|first=Joseph Cornelius|title=Gandhian economic thought|publisher=Vora|location=Bombay, India|year=1951|edition=1st|series=Library of Indian economics|oclc=3529600|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3529600?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhian economics places importance to means of achieving the aim of development and this means must be non-violent, ethical and truthful in all economic spheres. In order to achieve this means, he advocated [[Trusteeship (Gandhism)|trusteeship]], decentralization of economic activities, labour intensive technology and priority to weaker sections. Gandhi also had letter communication with Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy and saw himself as his disciple.&lt;ref&gt;In 1908 Leo Tolstoy wrote ''[[A Letter to a Hindu]]'', which said that only by using love as a weapon through [[passive resistance]] could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish ''A Letter to a Hindu'' in Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy's death in 1910. The letters concern practical and theological applications of non-violence.{{cite book|title=Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy: Letters |editor=Murthy, B.

Gandhian activists such as [[Vinoba Bhave]] and [[Jayaprakash Narayan]] were involved in the ''[[Sarvodaya]]'' movement, which sought to promote self-sufficiency amidst India's rural population by encouraging [[land redistribution]], socio-economic reforms and promoting [[cottage industries]]. The movement sought to combat the problems of class conflict, unemployment and poverty while attempting to preserve the lifestyle and values of rural Indians, which were eroding with [[industrialisation]] and modernisation. ''Sarvodaya'' also included ''[[Bhoodan]]'', or the gifting of land and agricultural resources by the landlords (called ''[[zamindar]]s'') to their tenant farmers in a bid to end the medieval system of ''zamindari''. ''The Conquest of Violence: An Essay on War and Revolution'' is a book written by dutch anarcho-pacifist [[Bart de Ligt]] which deals with nonviolent resistance in part inspired by the ideas of Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;"Gandhi's ideas were popularised in the West in books such as Richard Gregg's The Power of Nonviolence (1935), (34) and Bart de Ligt's The Conquest of Violence (1937)."[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Geoffrey_Ostergaard__Resisting_the_Nation_State._The_pacifist_and_anarchist_tradition.html Geoffrey Ostergaard.

Never surrendering his revolutionary vision and commitments, Marcuse continued to his death to defend the Marxian theory and libertarian socialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The emergence of the New Left in the 1950s and 1960s led to a revival of interest in libertarian socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Hahnel]], ''Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation'' Part II {{ISBN|0-415-93344-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Left's critique of the [[Old Left]]'s authoritarianism was associated with a strong interest in [[personal liberty]] and [[autonomy]] (see the thinking of [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]) which led to a rediscovery of older socialist traditions, such as left communism, council communism, and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. In the United States, this was caused by a renewal of anarchism from the 1950s forward through writers such as [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] and anarcho-pacifism which became influential in the [[anti-nuclear movement]] and [[anti war movement]]s of the time and which incorporated both the influences of [[Gandhism]] and Tolstoyan [[Christian anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;.

Where the more conventional wing of the peace movement rejected militarism and war under all but the most dire circumstances, the anarchist/pacifist wing rejected these on principle."[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm "Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement" by Barbara Epstein] "In the 1950s and 1960s anarcho-pacifism began to gel, tough-minded anarchists adding to the mixture their critique of the state, and tender-minded pacifists their critique of violence. Its first practical manifestation was at the level of method: nonviolent direct action, principled and pragmatic, was used widely in both the Civil Rights movement in the USA and the campaign against nuclear weapons in Britain and elsewhere."[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Geoffrey_Ostergaard__Resisting_the_Nation_State._The_pacifist_and_anarchist_tradition.html#toc13 Geoffrey Ostergaard.  ''Resisting the Nation State.

Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the [[Cold War]]."[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm "Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement" by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the [[Sydney Push]] was a predominantly left-wing intellectual [[subculture]] in Sydney from the late 1940s to the early 1970s which became associated with the label "Sydney libertarianism".&lt;ref&gt;See Baker A J [http://www.takver.com/history/aia/aia00026.htm "Sydney Libertarianism and the Push"] or at [http://www.nealemorison.com/wlmorison/sydlib.htm "Sydney Libertarians and the Push"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230052/http://www.nealemorison.com/wlmorison/sydlib.htm |date=2016-03-03 }} on Prof. W L Morison memorial site&lt;/ref&gt; The New Left also led to a revival of anarchism in the 1960s in the United States.

==== Social ecology and Communalism ====
{{main|Social ecology (theory)|Communalism}}
[[File:Murray Bookchin.jpg|thumb|upright|Murray Bookchin]]
Social ecology is closely related to the work and ideas of Murray Bookchin and influenced by anarchist Peter Kropotkin. Social ecologists assert that the present [[ecological crisis]] has its roots in human social problems and that the domination of human-over-nature stems from the domination of human-over-human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bookchin |first=Murray |title=The Philosophy of Social Ecology: Essays on Dialectical Naturalism |year=1994 |pages=119–20 |publisher=Black Rose Books|isbn=978-1-55164-018-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookchin later developed a political philosophy to complement social ecology which he called Communalism (spelled with a capital ''C'' to differentiate it from other forms of communalism). While originally conceived as a form of [[social anarchism]], he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of anarchism, Marxism, syndicalism and radical ecology.

Politically, Communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities or cities organized in a [[Confederation|confederated]] fashion. The method used to achieve this is called [[libertarian municipalism]] and involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions which grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state. Unlike anarchists, Communalists are not opposed to taking part in parliamentary politics&amp;mdash;especially municipal elections&amp;mdash;as long as candidates are libertarian socialist and [[Anti-statism|anti-statist]] in outlook.

==== Participism ====
{{main|Participism}}
[[File:NLN Michael Albert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Michael Albert]]]]
[[Participism]] is a 21st century form of libertarian socialism. It comprises two related economic and political systems called [[participatory economics]] or "parecon" and [[participatory politics]] or "parpolity".

Parecon is an economic system proposed primarily by activist and political theorist [[Michael Albert]] and radical economist [[Robin Hahnel]], among others. It uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society. Proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalist market economies and also an alternative to centrally planned socialism or coordinatorism, it is described as "an anarchistic economic vision" and it could be considered a form of socialism as under parecon the means of production are owned by the workers. It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions: workers' and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for decision making, balanced job complexes, remuneration according to effort and sacrifice and participatory planning. Under parecon, the current monetary system would be replaced with a system of non-transferable "credit" which would cease to exist upon purchase of a commodity.

Parpolity is a theoretical political system proposed by [[Stephen R. Shalom]]. It was developed as a political vision to accompany parecon. Participism as a whole is critical of aspects of modern [[representative democracies]] and capitalism arguing that the level of political control by the people is not sufficient. To address this problem, parpolity suggests a system of "Nested Councils", which would include every adult member of a given society. Under [[participism]], the state as such would dissolve into a mere coordinating body made up of delegates which would be recallable at any time by the nested council below them.

==== Inclusive Democracy ====
{{main|Inclusive Democracy}}
Inclusive Democracy (ID) is a political theory and political project that aim for direct democracy, [[economic democracy]] in a [[stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] (democracy in the social realm) and [[ecological democracy]]. As distinguished from the political project which is part of the democratic and autonomy traditions, the theoretical project of ID emerged from the work of political philosopher, former academic and activist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' and was further developed by him and other writers in the journal ''Democracy &amp; Nature'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', an [[electronic journal]] freely available and published by the International Network for ID.

According to [[Arran Gare]], ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy'' "offers a powerful new interpretation of the history and destructive dynamics of the market and provides an inspiring new vision of the future in place of both neo-liberalism and existing forms of socialism".&lt;ref&gt;Arran Gare, [http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin:989/SOURCE1 "Beyond Social Democracy? Takis Fotopoulos' Vision of an Inclusive Democracy as a New Liberatory Project"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706115814/http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin%3A989/SOURCE1 |date=2011-07-06 }} ''Democracy &amp; Nature'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (November 2003), pp. 345–58(14)&lt;/ref&gt; As David Freeman points out, although Fotopoulos' approach "is not openly anarchism, yet anarchism seems the formal category within which he works, given his commitment to direct democracy, municipalism and abolition of state, money and market economy".&lt;ref&gt;David Freeman, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol1/vol1_no3_freeman.htm "Inclusive democracy and its prospects"] review of book ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy: The Crisis of the Growth Economy and the Need For a New Liberatory Project'', published in ''Thesis Eleven'', Sage Publications, no. 69 (May 2002), pp. 103–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

An artificial market is proposed by this tendency as a solution to the problem of maintaining freedom of choice for the consumer within a marketless and moneyless economy, an artificial market operates in much the same way as traditional markets, but uses [[labour voucher]]s or personal credit in place of traditional money. According to Takis Fotopoulos, an artificial market "secures real freedom of choice, without incurring the adverse effects associated with real markets".&lt;ref name="inclusivedemocracy.org"&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/brtid/IDBook.pdf Towards an Inclusive Democracy: the crisis of the growth economy and the need for a new liberatory project], (London &amp; NY: Cassell, 1997), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insurrectionary anarchism ====
{{main|Insurrectionary anarchism}}
Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory, practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes the theme of [[insurrection]] within anarchist practice. It is critical of formal organizations such as labor unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization and small [[affinity group]]-based organization. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent [[class conflict]] and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.

Contemporary insurrectionary anarchism inherits the views and tactics of anti-organizational anarcho-communism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/insurrection.php "Say you want an insurrection"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013152611/http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/insurrection.php |date=2016-10-13 }} by [[Crimethinc]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[illegalism]]. Between 1880 and 1890,&lt;ref name="Alain Pengam"/&gt; with the "perspective of an [[immanent]] [[revolution]]",&lt;ref name="Alain Pengam"/&gt; who was "opposed to the official workers' movement", which was then in the process of formation (general social democratisation). They were opposed not only to political and statist struggles, but also to strikes which put forward wage or other claims, or which were organised by trade unions.&lt;ref name="Alain Pengam"/&gt; However, "[w]hile they were not opposed to strikes as such—they were opposed to trade unions and the struggle for the [[eight-hour day]]. This anti-reformist tendency was accompanied by an [[Individualist anarchism in Italy|anti-organisational tendency]], and its partisans declared themselves in favour of agitation amongst the unemployed for the expropriation of foodstuffs and other articles, for the expropriatory strike and, in some cases, for '[[individual recuperation]]' or acts of terrorism".&lt;ref name="Alain Pengam"/&gt; A resurgence of such ideas happened "in the peculiar conditions of postwar [[History of the Italian Republic#The First Republic (1948–1992)|Italy]] and [[History of Greece#Greek Civil War Greek Civil War (1944–1949)|Greece]]".&lt;ref name="joeblack"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ainfos.ca/06/jul/ainfos00232.html |title="Anarchism, insurrections and insurrectionalism" by Joe Black |publisher=Ainfos.ca |date=19 July 2006 |accessdate=20 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101206162459/http://www.ainfos.ca/06/jul/ainfos00232.html| archivedate= 6 December 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neozapatismo and Magonism ====
{{main|Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Emiliano Zapata|Magonism|Neozapatismo}}
[[File:SubMarcosHorseFromAfar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Subcomandante Marcos]]]]
The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (''Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional'', EZLN) often referred to as the ''zapatistas'' is a revolutionary leftist group based in [[Chiapas]], the southernmost state of Mexico. Since 1994, the group has been in a declared war "against the Mexican state", though this war has been primarily [[nonviolent]] and defensive against [[Military of Mexico|military]], [[paramilitary]] and [[Corporation|corporate]] incursions into Chiapas. Their social base is mostly rural [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous people]], but they have some supporters in urban areas and internationally. Their former spokesperson was [[Subcomandante Marcos]] (also known as Delegate Zero in relation to [[The Other Campaign]]). Unlike other Zapatist spokespeople, Marcos is not an indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]]. Since December 1994, the Zapatistas had been gradually forming several autonomous municipalities, called Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities (MAREZ). In these municipalities, an assembly of local representatives forms the ''Juntas de Buen Gobierno'' or [[Councils of Good Government]] (JBGs). These are not recognized by the federal or state governments and they oversee local community programs on food, health and education as well as taxation. The EZLN political formations have happened in two phases generally called ''Aquascalientes'' and ''Caracoles''.

The group takes its name from [[Emiliano Zapata]] (the agrarian reformer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/zapata-emiliano-1879-1919 |title=Zapata, Emiliano, 1879–1919 |publisher=libcom.org |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commander of the [[Liberation Army of the South]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]]) and sees itself as his ideological heir. ''Zapatista'' originally referred to a member of the revolutionary [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement founded about 1910 by Zapata. His Liberation Army of the South (''Ejército Libertador del Sur'') fought during the Mexican Revolution for the [[Land reform|redistribution of agricultural land]]. Zapata and his army and allies, including [[Pancho Villa]], fought for agrarian reform in Mexico. Specifically, they wanted to establish [[communal]] [[land rights]] for Mexico's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population, which had mostly lost its land to the wealthy elite of European descent. Zapata was partly influenced by an anarchist from [[Oaxaca]] named [[Ricardo Flores Magón]]. The influence of Flores Magón on Zapata can be seen in the Zapatist' [[Plan de Ayala]], but even more noticeably in their slogan (this slogan was never used by Zapata) ''Tierra y libertad'' or "Land and liberty", the title and maxim of Flores Magón's most famous work. Zapata's introduction to anarchism came via a local schoolteacher, Otilio Montaño Sánchez—later a general in Zapata's army, executed on 17 May 1917—who exposed Zapata to the works of Peter Kropotkin and Flores Magón at the same time as Zapata was observing and beginning to participate in the struggles of the peasants for the land.

In reference to inspirational figures, in nearly all EZLN villages exist murals accompanying images of Zapata, [[Che Guevara]] and Subcomandante Marcos.&lt;ref&gt;Baspineiro, Alex Contreras.

==== Communization ====
{{main|Communization}}
Communization mainly refers to a contemporary communist theory in which we find is a "mixing-up of [[insurrectionist anarchism]], the communist ultra-left, post-autonomists, anti-political currents, groups like [[The Coming Insurrection|the Invisible Committee]], as well as more explicitly 'communizing' currents, such as ''Théorie Communiste'' and ''Endnotes''. Obviously at the heart of the word is communism and, as the shift to communization suggests, communism as a particular activity and process".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Noys (ed). [http://www.minorcompositions.info/?p=299 ''Communization and its Discontents: Contestation, Critique, and Contemporary Struggles.''] Minor Compositions, [[Autonomedia]]. 2011. 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of the term communization with a self-identified "[[ultra-left]]" was cemented in France in the 1970s, where it came to describe not a transition to a higher phase of communism, but a vision of communist revolution itself. The 1975 Pamphlet ''A World Without Money'' thus states: "insurrection and communisation are intimately linked. There would not be first a period of insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social reality. The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation itself".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/world-without-money-les-amis-de-4-millions-de-jeunes-travailleurs "A World Without Money"] by Les amis de 4 millions de jeunes travailleurs. (Quoted passage not included in this English extract.)&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still used in this sense in France today and has spread into English usage as a result of the translation of texts by [[Gilles Dauvé]] and ''Théorie Comuniste'', two key figures in this tendency. In collaboration with other left communists such as François Martin and Karl Nesic, Dauvé has attempted to fuse, critique and develop different left communist currents, most notably the Italian movement associated with Amadeo Bordiga (and its heretical journal ''[[Invariance (magazine)|Invariance]]''), German Dutch council communism and the French perspectives associated with [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] and the [[Situationist International]].&lt;ref&gt;"The text surveys the Italian and German lefts, Socialisme Ou Barbarie and the Situationist International and describes the theoretical development of the French ultra-left."[http://libcom.org/library/re-collecting-our-past-la-banquise Re-collecting our past – La Banquise]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, a close yet not identical sense of "communization" was developed by the French post-situationist group [[Tiqqun]]. In keeping with their ultra-left predecessors, Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer synonymous with "the revolution" considered as an historical event, but rather becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities—from squatting and setting up communes to simply "sharing"—that would typically be understood as "pre-revolutionary".&lt;ref&gt;"As we apprehend it, the process of instituting communism can only take the form of a collection of acts of ''communisation'', of making common such-and-such space, such-and-such machine, such-and-such knowledge. That is to say, the elaboration of the mode of sharing that attaches to them. Insurrection itself is just an accelerator, a decisive moment in this process." Anonymous, [http://www.bloom0101.org/call.pdf ''Call''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212804/http://www.bloom0101.org/call.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From an ultra-left perspective, such a politics of "dropping-out" or, as Tiqqun put it, "desertion"—setting up spaces and practices that are held to partially autonomous from capitalism—is typically dismissed as either naive or reactionary.&lt;ref&gt;For a critique of Tiqqun from an ultra-left perspective, as well as a description of the opposition between the two sense of "communization" see "[http://libcom.org/library/reflexions-around-call Reflexions Around Call] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912181348/http://libcom.org/library/reflexions-around-call |date=2011-09-12 }}" Letters Journal #3. See also Dauvé and Nesic, [http://troploin0.free.fr/ii/index.php/textes/19-communisation-un-appel-et-une-invite "Un Appel et une Invite"].&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the popularity of the Tiqqun-related works ''Call'' and ''[[The Coming Insurrection]]'' in the American anarchist circles, it tended to be this latter sense of "communization" that was employed in American anarchist and "[[insurrectionist]]" communiques, notably within the [[2009 California college tuition hike protests|Californian student movement of 2009–2010]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://afterthefallcommuniques.info/ "After the Fall: Communiqués from Occupied California"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126222020/http://afterthefallcommuniques.info/ |date=2011-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic confederalism is the proposal of a libertarian socialist [[political system]] that "is open towards other political groups and factions. It is flexible, [[Multiculturalism|multi-cultural]], anti-monopolistic, and [[Consensus decision-making|consensus-oriented]]".&lt;ref name="Ocalan 2011. p. 21"&gt;[[Abdullah Öcalan|Öcalan, Abdullah]].[http://www.freeocalan.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Ocalan-Democratic-Confederalism.pdf "Democratic Confederalism''].

While originally a Marxist–Leninist organization, the organization modified their views as Öcalan began corresponding with Murray Bookchin and incorporating his ideology.

In his book, he says: "The stronger the participation the more powerful is this kind of democracy. While the nation-state is in contrast to democracy, and even denies it, democratic confederalism constitutes a continuous democratic process".&lt;ref name="Ocalan 2011. p. 26-27"&gt;Öcalan, Abdullah.[http://www.freeocalan.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Ocalan-Democratic-Confederalism.pdf  "Democratic Confederalism''].

He explains that their pacifism, anarchism, and commitment to the downtrodden were one of the important models and inspirations for the 60s. As Farrell puts it, "Catholic Workers identified the issues of the sixties before the Sixties began, and they offered models of protest long before the protest decade."[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SA/en/display/268 "The Spirit of the Sixties: The Making of Postwar Radicalism" by James J. Farrell]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"While not always formally recognized, much of the protest of the sixties was anarchist. Within the nascent women's movement, anarchist principles became so widespread that a political science professor denounced what she saw as "The Tyranny of Structurelessness." Several groups have called themselves "Amazon Anarchists." After the [[Stonewall Rebellion]], the New York [[Gay Liberation Front]] based their organization in part on a reading of Murray Bookchin's anarchist writings."

Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement." [http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm "Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement" by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 in [[Carrara]], Italy, the [[International of Anarchist Federations]] was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France, the [[Italian Anarchist Federation|Italian]] and the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Iberian Anarchist Federation]] as well as the Bulgarian Anarchist Federation in French exile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/l/10760196.php London Federation of Anarchists involvement in Carrara conference, 1968] International Institute of Social History, Accessed 19 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980206152015/http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/ifa-hist-short.html Short history of the IAF-IFA] A-infos news project, Accessed 19 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The uprisings of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] also led to a small resurgence of interest in left communist ideas. Various small left communist groups emerged around the world, predominantly in the leading capitalist countries. A series of conferences of the communist left began in 1976, with the aim of promoting international and cross-tendency discussion, but these petered out in the 1980s without having increased the profile of the movement or its unity of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.internationalism.org/ir/122_conferences |title=The International Conferences of the Communist Left (1976–80) &amp;#124; International Communist Current |publisher=En.internationalism.org |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent [[list of left communist internationals|left communist groups existing today]] include the [[International Communist Party]], [[International Communist Current]] and the [[Internationalist Communist Tendency]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and [[Squatting|squatter]] movements like that of Barcelona, Spain. In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the [[Freetown Christiania]], an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen.

Around the turn of the 21st century, libertarian socialism grew in popularity and influence as part of the [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]], anti-capitalist and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.&lt;ref name="rupert"&gt;{{cite book | page=66 |last = Rupert | first = Mark | title = Globalization and International Political Economy | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-7425-2943-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[Group of Eight]] (G8) and the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF). Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ''ad hoc'', leaderless, anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s—other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity groups]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.&lt;ref name="rupert" /&gt; A significant event of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name="rupert" /&gt; For English anarchist scholar [[Simon Critchley]], "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary [[neo-liberalism]]...One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally".&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Critchley#Infinitely Demanding (2007)|Infinitely Demanding]]'' by [[Simon Critchley]]. [[Verso Books|Verso]]. 2007. p. 125''&lt;/ref&gt; This might also have been motivated by "the collapse of '[[Real socialism|really existing socialism]]' and the capitulation to [[neo-liberalism]] of Western social democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Chamsy el- Ojeili. ''Beyond post-socialism. Dialogues with the far-left.'' Palgrave Macmillan. 2015. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

International anarchist federations in existence include the [[International of Anarchist Federations]] (IAF), the [[International Workers' Association]] (IWA) and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]] (ILS). The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain in the form of the [[Confederacion General del Trabajo de España|Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT). CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark "Trade union membership 1993–2003" (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian socialists in the early 21st century have been involved in the [[alter-globalization]] movement, squatter movement; [[social centers]]; [[infoshop]]s; anti-poverty groups such as [[Ontario Coalition Against Poverty]] and [[Food Not Bombs]]; [[Leasehold estate|tenants']] unions; [[housing cooperative]]s; [[Intentional community|intentional communities]] generally and [[egalitarian communities]]; [[anti-sexist]] organizing; grassroots media initiatives; digital media and computer activism; experiments in [[participatory economics]]; [[anti-racist]] and [[anti-fascist]] groups like [[Anti-Racist Action]] and [[Anti-Fascist Action]]; activist groups protecting the rights of [[immigrant]]s and promoting the free movement of people, such as the [[No Border network]]; [[worker co-operative]]s, [[countercultural]] and artist groups; and the [[peace movement]]. Libertarian socialism has also more recently played a large part in the global [[Occupy movement]],&lt;ref&gt;"If any radical left tendency has been responsible for inspiring action, the palm should go to Marxism's historic antagonist on the Left – anarchism. Wherever movements have been provoked against neoliberalism, black flags have tended to outnumber red. Autonomista and other kinds of left-libertarian thought were major currents running through movements in Greece and Spain. The cornerstone for the occupation of Zuccotti Park was laid by anarchists, who also developed the consensus procedures by which the movement participants made (or occasionally failed to make) decisions."

'''''Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopædia''''' was a book series of 133&lt;ref name="New-York1856"/&gt; volumes, edited by [[Dionysius Lardner]].

==Background==
[[File:Scott History of Scotland Finden.jpg|thumb|Illustration from the first volume of ''Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopædia'', the ''History of Scotland by Walter Scott]]''
During the first quarter of the 19th century, self-improvement literature became an important portion of the book market: "it was the age of the 'Family Library' edition".&lt;ref&gt;Crook, xix.&lt;/ref&gt; In his article on the ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'', Morse Peckham writes that this "revolution in literacy, [was] partly the result of the spread of liberal ideas by the French Revolution, [and] partly of the desire to combat those ideas by teaching the poor to read the Bible and religious tracts&amp;nbsp;[...&amp;nbsp;It] was to have an effect on modern society almost as profound as the industrial and agricultural revolutions".&lt;ref&gt;Peckham, 38; for a longer explanation of this phenomenon, see Smith, 128–31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dionysius Lardner|Dionysius Lardner's]] ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'', published between 1829 and 1846, was one of the most successful of these enterprises, which also included [[John Murray (1778–1843)|John Murray's]] ''[[Murray's Family Library|Family Library]]'' and the publications of the [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;Crook, xix; Kucich, "Biographer", 227; Peckham, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Although intended for the "general reader", the series was aimed specifically at the middle class rather than the masses: each volume cost six [[shilling]]s, prohibiting purchase by the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, xx; Kucich, "Biographer", 235; Peckham, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisements for the ''Cyclopaedia'' describe the expected audience as "merchants, captains, families, [and] new-married couples".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Kucich, "Biographer", 235.&lt;/ref&gt; The prospectus assured its readers that "nothing will be admitted into the pages of the 'CABINET CYCLOPAEDIA' which can have the most remote tendency to offend public or private morals. To enforce the cultivation of religion and the practice of virtue should be a principal object with all who undertake to inform the public mind."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Peckham, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was divided into five "Cabinets": Arts and Manufactures, Biography, History, Natural History, and Natural Philosophy. The advertisement claimed these covered "all the usual divisions of knowledge that are not of a technical and professional kind".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Crook, xx; see also Kucich, "Biographer", 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other encyclopedias of the time, Lardner's ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'' arranged its articles topically rather than alphabetically.&lt;ref name="Peckham, 40"&gt;Peckham, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The series eventually contained 61 titles in 133 volumes and customers could purchase a single volume, a single cabinet, or the entire set.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, xx; Peckham, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume was published in December 1829 by [[Longman]], Reese, Orme, Browne, Greene, and [[John Taylor (1781-1864)|John Taylor]].&lt;ref name="Crook, xx"&gt;Crook, xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-eight identified authors contributed (others are unidentified);&lt;ref&gt;Peckham, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Shelley]] was the only female contributor and the eighth most productive.&lt;ref name="Crook, xx"/&gt;

Reverend Dr. Dionysius Lardner, a science lecturer at [[University College London]], started the ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'' in 1827 or 1828.&lt;ref name="Peckham, 40"/&gt; The authors who contributed to the volumes spanned the political spectrum and included many luminaries of the day. [[James Mackintosh]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Thomas Moore]], and [[Connop Thirlwall]] wrote histories; [[Robert Southey]] wrote naval biographies; [[Henry Roscoe (legal writer)|Henry Roscoe]] wrote [[legal biographies]]; [[John Herschel]] wrote on astronomy and the philosophy of science; [[Augustus de Morgan|August de Morgan]] wrote on mathematics; [[David Brewster]] wrote on optics; and Lardner himself wrote on mathematics and physics.&lt;ref&gt;Peckham, 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Authors were usually paid about £200 for each volume, though some contracts were much higher or lower. For example, Irish poet Thomas Moore was contracted to write a two-volume ''History of Ireland'' for £1,500.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, xxiv, note a.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons the overall project ran into difficulty may have been that it overpaid well-known writers.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Peckham speculates that the reason many of the famous writers listed on the prospectus never participated was because of the project's financial problems. The 19 substitute contributors were, he writes, "at the time and subsequently a far less distinguished group than Lardner had originally announced".&lt;ref&gt;Peckham, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The books were relatively expensive to print, because of the Corbould and [[William Finden|Finden]] illustrations, the images for the scientific volumes, and the use of [[Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, Ltd.|Spottiswoode's]] printing house.&lt;ref name="crookxxv"&gt;Crook, xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to cut costs, the publishers decided to use small print and narrow margins.&lt;ref name="crookxxv" /&gt; An estimated 4,000 copies of the first edition of the early volumes were printed, but the print run would probably have fallen to 2,500 since the sales did not pick up after 1835.&lt;ref name="crookxxv" /&gt; As it became clear that the series was not going to take off, fewer review copies were sent out and advertisements became smaller.&lt;ref name="crookxxv" /&gt; Lardner's interest in the project may also have waned, as he paid less attention to its business dealings.&lt;ref name="crookxxv" /&gt; However, some volumes of the ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'' remained in print until 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the popularity of encyclopedias at the beginning of the 19th century, the ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'' did not receive enough critical notice to make it a bestseller. Often the reviews were "perfunctory".&lt;ref name="crookxxv" /&gt; However, some individual writers received attention. Moore, for example, was given a front-page spread in the ''Literary Gazette'' for his history of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, xxiv–v.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley's volumes received 12 reviews in total—a good number—but "her name was never fully exploited" in the project; whether by her choice or Lardner's, it is unclear.&lt;ref name="crookxxv" /&gt; Nevertheless, Peckham writes that "the ''Cyclopaedia'' on the whole was a distinguished and valuable work", and some of the individual volumes became famous.&lt;ref&gt;Peckham, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City''' is a [[UNESCO]] designated [[World Heritage Site]] in [[Liverpool]], England. It comprises six locations in the city centre of Liverpool including the [[Pier Head]], [[Albert Dock]] and [[William Brown Street]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liverpool – Maritime Mercantile City |publisher=UK Local Authority World Heritage Forum |url=http://www.lawhf.gov.uk/LAWHF/liverpool.htm |accessdate=9 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423041054/http://www.lawhf.gov.uk/LAWHF/liverpool.htm |archivedate=23 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes many of the city's most famous landmarks.

UNESCO received the [[Liverpool City Council|city council's]] nomination for the six sites in January 2003 and in September of that year sent [[ICOMOS]] representatives to carry out an evaluation on the eligibility for these areas to be given World Heritage Status. In March 2004 ICOMOS recommended that UNESCO inscribe the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City as a World Heritage Site.&lt;ref name=ICOMOS/&gt;

The area was inscribed during the 28th session of the [[World Heritage Site#World Heritage Committee Session|World Heritage Committee]] in 2004 under cultural criteria [[World Heritage Site#Selection criteria|ii, iii and iv]]. Its inclusion by UNESCO was attributed to the fact that it was 'the supreme example of a commercial port at a time of Britain's greatest global influence'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to Liverpool World Heritage |publisher=[[Liverpool City Council]] |url=http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/ |accessdate=9 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222083911/http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/ |archivedate=22 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the site was inscribed on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] due to the proposed construction of [[Liverpool Waters]] project.

In July 2017, UNESCO warned that the city's status as a World Heritage Site was at risk of being rescinded in light of planning and development proposals, with [[English Heritage]] asserting that the proposed [[Liverpool Waters]] development would leave the setting of some of Liverpool’s most significant historic buildings “severely compromised”, the archaeological remains of parts of the historic docks “at risk of destruction”, and “the city’s historic urban landscape ... permanently unbalanced”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/03/liverpool-world-heritage-site-threat-taskforce|work=[[the Guardian]]|title=Liverpool faces up to world heritage removal threat with taskforce|first=Frances|last=Perraudin|date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
The '''Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City''' comprises six separate locations throughout the centre of the city, each of which relates to a different component and time in the Liverpool's maritime history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool - Maritime Mercantile City |publisher=[[Visit Britain]]|url=http://www.visitbritain.com/en/things-to-see-and-do/interests/history-and-heritage/map/maritime-mercantile-city.aspx |accessdate=9 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscribed sites extend for approximately 4&amp;nbsp;km north-south along the city's waterfront and stretch approximately 1&amp;nbsp;km east-west.&lt;ref name="Liverpool City Council (2005), p17"&gt;Liverpool City Council (2005), p17&lt;/ref&gt; In total it covers an area of 136&amp;nbsp;[[hectares]].&lt;ref name="Liverpool City Council (2005), p26"&gt;Liverpool City Council (2005), p26&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pier Head===
{{main|Pier Head}}
The Pier Head is the focal point of Liverpool's waterfront and is dominated by three of its most recognisable landmarks: The [[Liver Building]], The [[Port of Liverpool Building]] and the [[Cunard Building]]. Collectively referred to as the [[Charites|Three Graces]], they stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century when Liverpool was one of the most important ports in the world.&lt;ref name=Pier&gt;{{cite web |title=Pier Head |publisher=World Heritage Liverpool |url=http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/pierhead/index.asp |accessdate=10 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207111903/http://liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/pierhead/index.asp |archivedate=7 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially plans existed to add a 'fourth grace' to area, named ''The Cloud'' and designed by [[Will Alsop]], however this fell through in 2004. Today, in what would have been its place, a new [[Museum of Liverpool]] opened on 19 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Liverpool|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/about/|publisher=Liverpool museums|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Building a New Museum |publisher=[[National Museums Liverpool]] |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/ |accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the Port of Liverpool building is the [[art deco]] [[Queensway Tunnel|George's Dock Ventilation Tower]], whose design is heavily influenced by Egyptian architectural styling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=George's Dock Ventilation |publisher=Liverpool World Heritage |url=http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/pierhead/georgesdockventilation.asp |accessdate=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a part of the site is the old [[George's Dock]] wall, which dates from the late 18th century, as well as several memorials, including one built to [[Memorial to the Engine Room Heroes of the Titanic|honour the engineers]] who remained at their post as the [[RMS Titanic]] sank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorial to the Engine Room Heroes of the Titanic |publisher=Liverpool World Heritage |url=http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/pierhead/memorialtoengineroomheroes.asp |accessdate=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Albert Dock===
{{main|Albert Dock}}

The Albert Dock is a complex of dock buildings and warehouses located to the south of the Pier Head. Designed by [[Jesse Hartley]] and [[Philip Hardwick]] and opened in 1846, the Albert Dock warehouses were the first in the world to be entirely fireproof, due to their construction from only iron, brick and stone, with no structural wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jones | first = Ron | title = The Albert Dock, Liverpool | publisher = RJ Associates Ltd | year = 2004 | pages = 83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dock was home to many advances in docking technology including being the first to have [[hydraulic]] cranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jones | first = Ron | title = The Albert Dock, Liverpool | publisher = RJ Associates Ltd | year = 2004 | pages = 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]] the buildings suffered significant damage and general docking decline in the city after the end of the war saw them fall rapidly into disrepair. In the 1980s the area underwent massive regeneration after the creation of the [[Merseyside Development Corporation]] and the complex was reopened to the public in 1984, as part of the tall ships festival. Today they form a focal point for tourism in the city, being home to [[Tate Liverpool]], [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]] and [[The Beatles Story]]. They also constitute the largest single collection of Grade I [[listed buildings]] anywhere in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/cityofculture2008/story/0,,950372,00.html |title=Glory of Greece, grandeur of Rome ... and docks of Liverpool |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |date=7 March 2003 |author=Helen Carter |accessdate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Stanley Dock Conservation Area===

The Stanley Dock Conservation area is located to the north of the [[Pier Head]] and includes huge swathes of Liverpool's docking heartland. Within the site are several docks including [[Stanley Dock]], [[Collingwood Dock]], [[Salisbury Dock]] and [[Clarence Dock (Liverpool)|Clarence]] [[Graving Dock]]; parts of the [[Leeds Liverpool Canal]] and associated [[canal locks]]; and many smaller features such as bridges, [[bollards]] and [[Capstan (nautical)|capstans]].&lt;ref name=Stanley&gt;{{cite web|title=The Stanley Dock Conservation area |publisher=Liverpool World Heritage |url=http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/stanleydock/index.asp |accessdate=7 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506233248/http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/stanleydock/index.asp |archivedate=6 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the Clarence Graving Docks are notable as the oldest docks still in use in the city today, dating back to 1830, although their full development wasn't completed until 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clarence Graving Docks |publisher=Liverpool World Heritage |url=http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/stanleydock/clarencegravingdocks.asp |accessdate=9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the buildings in the area are the [[Victoria Tower (Liverpool)|Victoria Clock Tower]] and [[Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse]], one of the largest brick buildings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse |publisher=Liverpool World Heritage |url=http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/stanleydock/tobaccowarehouse.asp |accessdate=7 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204102301/http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/stanleydock/tobaccowarehouse.asp |archivedate=4 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duke Street Conservation Area/ Ropewalks===

The ''Ropewalks'' site comprises the south western component of the Duke Street conservation area, as well as two warehouses on College Lane and [[Bluecoat Chambers]] on School lane. The location was one of the first areas in the city to develop when Liverpool was an emerging port,&lt;ref name=Duke&gt;{{cite web|title=Duke Street Area/Ropewalks |publisher=Liverpool World Heritage |url=http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/dukestreet/index.asp |accessdate=1 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626173807/http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/dukestreet/index.asp |archivedate=26 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Bluecoat Chambers being the oldest surviving building in Liverpool city centre, dating back to 1715.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Pollard| first =Richard |author2=Nikolaus Pevsner  | title =The Buildings of England: Lancashire: Liverpool and the South-West | publisher =[[Yale University Press]] | year =2006 | location =New Haven &amp; London | pages = 302–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its proximity to the [[Old Dock]], the world's first enclosed wet dock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trading Places: Old Dock History |publisher=[[National Museums Liverpool]] |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/docks/access/dock_history7.html |accessdate=1 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324050020/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/docks/access/dock_history7.html |archivedate=24 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; meant it was the location of the city's first property speculators who built both warehousing and residential premises along Duke St, Hannover St, and Bold St. The area soon developed a cosmopolitan feel being home to various types of people including sea captains, merchants, traders and artisans. Today the area is known as Ropewalks, a reference to the large number of [[roperies]] present in the area when Liverpool was one of the busiest ports in the world during the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name=Duke/&gt;

===The 'Commercial Quarter'/Castle Street Conservation Area===

This part of the WHS is focused around what would have previously been medieval Liverpool and includes Castle Street dominated by Trials Hotel at one end and the Town Hall at the other linking Old Hall Street by Exchange Flags, Victoria Street, Water Street and Dale Street. Today a centre for commercial activity in the city, the area was included due to the nature of its street development over three centuries and the grandeur of its architecture and monuments.&lt;ref name=Castle&gt;{{cite web|title=Castle/Dale/Old Hall St Commercial Centre |publisher=Liverpool World Heritage |url=http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/castlestreet/index.asp |accessdate=6 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719162901/http://www.liverpoolworldheritage.com/visitingthewhs/areas/castlestreet/index.asp |archivedate=19 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having received the nomination for the area in January 2003, the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] (ICOMOS) travelled to Liverpool in September of that year to carry out an evaluation on behalf of UNESCO. The ICOMOS evaluation analysed the city in relation to its nomination document, looking at four key areas: conservation, authenticity and integrity, comparative evaluation and outstanding universal value.&lt;ref name=ICOMOS&gt;{{cite web |title=Liverpool (United Kingdom) - NO 1050 |publisher=[[ICOMOS]] |year=2004 |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/1150.pdf |accessdate=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Conservation''' - In terms of conservation status ICOMOS were happy that a wide range of buildings from the 18th through to 20th century were preserved within the city, despite two world wars and significant decline during the 1970s. However, they keenly stressed the importance of continued preservation suggesting that all future developments within the nominated areas are stringently monitored.
* '''Authenticity and integrity''' - ICOMOS were pleased with manner in which the nominated areas had maintained the majority of their historical integrity, despite some major regeneration and development projects since the Second World War. The urban fabric of the six sites ranged from the 18th to 20th century and the committee were happy that the city's street pattern provided a readable representation of different periods in Liverpool's history.
* '''Comparative evaluation''' - As part of their evaluation ICOMOS compared Liverpool's maritime history with that of other major ports throughout both the UK and wider world. They felt that Liverpool had values and qualities that set it apart from many other port cities both in terms of its maritime function and architectural and cultural significance.
* '''Outstanding universal value''' - In analysing Liverpool's Maritime Mercantile City in terms of its universal value, ICOMOS concurred with the local council that Liverpool was the 'supreme example of a commercial port at the time of Britain's greatest global influence'. In particular they noted the role the city played in the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]], the development of docking technology and railway transportation, and the attention given to cultural activities and architecture.

Upon completion of their evaluation, ICOMOS returned to UNESCO with the recommendation that the area be inscribed as a world heritage site. At the same time they made several recommendations regarding future preservation and development within the areas and their buffer zones.&lt;ref name=ICOMOS/&gt; As a result, the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City was inscribed as a [[world heritage site]] at the 28th session of the World Heritage Committee in 2004, under the cultural criteria ii, iii and iv:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nominations of Cultural Properties to the World Heritage List (Liverpool - Maritime Mercantile City)  |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/132 |accessdate=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Criterion (ii)''': "Liverpool was a major centre generating innovative technologies and methods in dock construction and port management in the 18th and 19th centuries. It thus contributed to the building up of the international mercantile systems throughout the British Commonwealth."
*'''Criterion (iii)''': "The city and the port of Liverpool are an exceptional testimony to the development of maritime mercantile culture in the 18th and 19th centuries, contributing to the building up of the British Empire. It was a centre for the slave trade, until its abolition in 1807, and for emigration from northern Europe to America."
*'''Criterion (iv)''': "Liverpool is an outstanding example of a world mercantile port city, which represents the early development of global trading and cultural connections throughout the British Empire."

'''''Modernisme''''' ({{IPA-ca|muðərˈnizmə}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] for "modernism"), also known as '''[[Catalan people#Culture and society|Catalan]] modernism''', is the historiographic denomination given to an art and literature movement associated with the search of a new entitlement of Catalan culture, one of the most predominant cultures within [[Spain]]. Nowadays it is considered a movement based on the cultural reivindication of a ''catalan identity''. Its main form of expression was in architecture, but many other arts were involved (painting, sculpture, etc.), and especially the design and the decorative arts (cabinetmaking, carpentry, forged iron, ceramic tiles, ceramics, glass-making, silver and goldsmith work, etc.), which were particularly important, especially in their role as support to architecture. Modernisme was also a literary movement (poetry, fiction, drama). 

Although Modernisme was part of a general trend that emerged in [[Europe]] around the [[Fin de siècle|turn of the 20th century]], in [[Catalonia]] the trend acquired its own unique personality. Modernisme's distinct name comes from its special relationship, primarily with [[Catalonia]] and [[Barcelona]], which were intensifying their local characteristics for socio-ideological reasons after the revival of Catalan culture and in the context of spectacular urban and industrial development. It is equivalent to a number of other [[fin de siècle]] art movements going by the names of [[Art Nouveau]] in [[France]] and [[Belgium]], [[Jugendstil]] in [[Germany]], [[Secession (art)|Sezession]] in [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Liberty style]] in [[Italy]] and Modern or [[Glasgow Style]] in [[Scotland]].

Modernisme was active from roughly 1888 (the [[Exposición Universal de Barcelona|First Barcelona World Fair]]) to 1911 (the death of [[Joan Maragall]], the most important ''Modernista'' poet). The ''Modernisme'' movement was centred in the city of [[Barcelona]], though it reached far beyond, and is best known for its architectural expression, especially in the work of [[Antoni Gaudí]], but was also significant in sculpture, poetry, theatre and painting. Notable painters include [[Santiago Rusiñol]], [[Ramon Casas]],&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Robert (1993) 'Barcelona', London, {{ISBN|0-00-272167-8}}, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidre Nonell]], [[Hermen Anglada Camarasa]], Joaquim Mir, [[Eliseu Meifrèn]], Lluïsa Vidal and Miquel Utrillo. Notable sculptors are [[Josep Llimona]], Eusebi Arnau and Miquel Blai.

==Main concepts==
[[File:Barcelona-gm4.jpg|thumb|right|Duana de Barcelona (Customs House), by [[Enric Sagnier]]]]

[[Catalan nationalism]] was an important influence upon ''Modernista'' artists, who were receptive to the ideas of [[Valentí Almirall]] and [[Enric Prat de la Riba]] and wanted Catalan culture to be regarded as equal to that of other European countries. Such ideas can be seen in some of Rusiñol's plays against the Spanish army (most notably ''[[L'Hèroe]]''), in some authors close to [[anarchism]] ([[Jaume Brossa]] and [[Gabriel Alomar]], for example) or in the articles of [[federalism|federalist]] anti-[[monarchism|monarchic]] writers such as [[Miquel dels Sants Oliver]]. They also opposed the traditionalism and religiousness of the [[Renaixença]] Catalan Romantics, whom they ridiculed in plays such as [[Santiago Rusiñol]]'s ''[[Els Jocs Florals de Canprosa]]'' (roughly, "The Poetry Contest of Proseland"), a satire of the revived [[Jocs Florals]] and the political milieu which promoted them.

''Modernistes'' largely rejected bourgeois values, which they thought to be the opposite of art. Consequently, they adopted two stances: they either set themselves apart from society in a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] or culturalist attitude (Decadent and Parnassian poets, Symbolist playwrights, etc.) or they attempted to use art to change society (''Modernista'' architects and designers, playwrights inspired by [[Henrik Ibsen]], some of [[Joan Maragall|Maragall]]'s poetry, etc.)

==Architecture and the plastic arts==
The earliest example of ''Modernista'' [[architecture]] is the café Castell dels tres Dragons designed by [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] in the Parc de la Ciutadella for the [[Exposición Universal de Barcelona|1888 Universal Exhibition]]. It is a search for a particular style for Catalonia drawing on Medieval and Arab styles. Like the currents known in other countries as [[Art Nouveau]], Jugendstil, Stile Liberty, Modern Style or [[Sezessionstil]], ''Modernisme'' was closely related to the English [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and the [[Gothic revival]]. As well as combining a rich variety of historically-derived elements, it is characterized by the predominance of the curve over the straight line, by rich decoration and detail, by the frequent use of vegetal and other organic motifs, the taste for asymmetry, a refined aestheticism and dynamic shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Solà-Morales, I, (1992) 'Arquitectura Modernista, fi de segle a Barcelona', Barcelona, {{ISBN|84-252-1563-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Barcelona was the centre of ''Modernista'' construction, the Catalan industrial bourgeoisie built industrial buildings and summer residences - ''cases d'estiueig'' - in many Catalan towns, notably [[Terrassa]] and [[Reus]]. The textile factory which is now home to the Catalan national technical museum [[MNACTEC]] is an outstanding example.

[[File:Reptil Parc Guell Barcelona.jpg|thumb|right|'El drac' (dragon) in the [[Parc Güell]], by [[Antoni Gaudí]].]]
[[Antoni Gaudí]] is the best-known architect of this movement. Other influential architects were [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] and [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]], and later [[Josep Maria Jujol]], [[Rafael Guastavino]] and [[Enrique Nieto (architect)|Enrique Nieto]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, David, 'Modern architecture in Barcelona, 1854-1929', Barcelona, 1985. {{cite web |url=http://www.anglo-catalan.org/op/monographs/issue03.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425152348/http://www.anglo-catalan.org/op/monographs/issue03.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
In literature, ''Modernisme'' stood out the most in narrative. The ''nouvelles'' and novels of decadent writers such as [[Prudenci Bertrana]] (whose highly controversial ''[[Josafat (book)|Josafat]]'' involved a demented priest who ends up killing a prostitute), [[Caterina Albert]] (also known as Víctor Catala), author of bloody, expressionistic tales of rural violence, opposed to the idealisation of nature propugned by Catalan Romantics, or [[Raimon Casellas]] have been highly influential upon later Catalan narrative, essentially recovering a genre that had been lost due to political causes since the end of the Middle Ages. Those writers often, though not always, show influences from Russian literature of the 19th Century and also [[Gothic novel]]s. Still, works not influenced by those sources, such as [[Joaquim Ruyra]]'s slice-of-life tales of the North-Eastern Catalan coast are perhaps even more influential than that of the aforementioned authors, and Rusiñol's well-known ''[[L'auca del senyor Esteve]]'' (roughly "The Tale of Mr. Esteve"; an ''[[auca (cartoon)|auca]]'' is a type of illustrated [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]], similar to a one-sheet comic book) is an ironic critique of Catalan bourgeoisie more related to ironic, pre-Realist Catalan ''costumisme''.

In poetry, ''Modernisme'' closely follows Symbolist and Parnassian poetry, with poets frequently crossing the line between both tendencies or alternating between them. Another important strain of ''Modernista'' poetry is [[Joan Maragall]]'s "Paraula viva" (''Living word'') school, which advocated Nietzschean vitalism and spontaneous and imperfect writing over cold and thought-over poetry. Although poetry was very popular with the ''Modernistes'' and there were lots of poets involved in the movement, Maragall is the only ''Modernista'' poet who is still widely read today.

''Modernista'' theatre was also important, as it smashed the insubstantial regional plays that were popular in 19th century Catalonia. There were two main schools of ''Modernista'' theatre: social theatre, which intended to change society and denounce injustice—the worker stories of [[Ignasi Iglésias]], for example ''[[Els Vells]]'' ("The old ones"); the Ibsen-inspired works of [[Joan Puig i Ferreter]], most notably ''[[Aigües Encantades]]'' ("Enchanted Waters"); Rusiñol's antimilitaristic play ''[[L'Hèroe]]''—and symbolist theatre, which emphasised the distance between artists and the bourgeoisie—for example, Rusiñol's ''[[Cigales i Formigues]]'' ("Cicadas and Ants") or ''[[El Jardí Abandonat]]'' ("The Abandoned Garden").

==Linguistics==
''Modernista'' ideas impelled ''[[L'Avenç]]'' collaborator [[Pompeu Fabra]] to devise a new [[orthography]] for Catalan. However, only with the later rise of [[Noucentisme]] did his projects come to fruition and end the orthographic chaos which reigned at the time.

==Decline==
By 1910, ''Modernisme'' had been accepted by the bourgeoisie and had pretty much turned into a fad. It was around this time that [[Noucentisme|Noucentista]] artists started to ridicule the rebel ideas of ''Modernisme'' and propelled a more bourgeois art and a more right-of-center version of Catalan Nationalism, which eventually rose to power with the victory of the [[Regionalist League|Lliga Regionalista]] in 1912. Until [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]'s dictatorship suppressed all substantial public use of Catalan, Noucentisme was immensely popular in Catalonia. However, ''Modernisme'' did have a revival of sorts during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], with ''[[avant-garde]]'' writers such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] [[Joan-Salvat Papasseit]] earning comparisons to Joan Maragall, and the spirit of [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] such as [[Josep Vicent Foix]] or [[Salvador Dalí]] being clearly similar to the rebellion of the ''Modernistes'', what with Dalí proclaiming that Catalan Romanticist [[Àngel Guimerà]] was ''a putrefact pervert''. However, the ties between Catalan art from the 1930s and ''Modernisme'' are not that clear, as said artists were not consciously attempting to continue any tradition.

''Modernista'' architecture survived longer. The Spanish city of [[Melilla]] in Northern Africa experienced an economic boom at the turn of the 20th century, and its new bourgeoisie showed its riches by massively ordering ''Modernista'' buildings. The workshops established there by Catalan architect [[Enrique Nieto (architect)|Enrique Nieto]] continued producing decorations in this style even when it was out of [[fashion in Barcelona]], which results in Melilla having, oddly enough, the second largest concentration of ''Modernista'' works after Barcelona.

== UNESCO World Heritage ==
Some of the works of Catalan Modernism have been listed by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Cultural Heritage]]:

== Architects ==
There were more than 100 architects who made buildings of the ''Modernista'' style, three of whom are particularly well known for their outstanding buildings: [[Antoni Gaudí]], [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] and [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]].

* [[Antoni Gaudí]], who went beyond mainstream ''Modernisme'', creating a personal style based on observation of the nature and exploitation of traditional Catalan construction traditions. He was using regulated geometric shapes as the [[hyperbolic paraboloid]], the hyperboloid, the helicoid and the conoide.&lt;ref&gt;http://noticias.arq.com.mx/Detalles/9955.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] created a genuine alternative architecture. Along with [[Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas]] he worked towards a modern and international style. Domènech continued on from Viollet-le-Duc, his work characterized by a mix of constructive rationalism and ornaments inspired in the Hispano-Arab architecture as seen in the [[Palau de la Música Catalana]], in the [[Hospital de Sant Pau]] or in the [[Institut Pere Mata]] of Reus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arteespana.com/arquitecturamodernista.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His Hotel Internacional at Passeig de Colom in Barcelona (demolished after the 1888 World Fair) was an early example of industrial building techniques.
* [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]] was a Catalan architect, politician and historian who was involved in many projects to restore older buildings. One of his most well-known buildings is his rebuilding of the [[Casa Amatller]] in [[Passeig de Gràcia]]. It has elements in both the Catalan tradition and others originating in the [[Netherlands]] or the [[Germany|German]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. [[Neo-Gothic]] is also apparent in his Codorniu Winery (Caves Codorniu, 1904). He built Casa Amatller and [[Casa Trinxet]].

Smith|title=Old English: A Linguistic Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SduG-tIxL-AC&amp;pg=PA125|date=2 April 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86677-4|pages=125–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The helmets are of typical [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] '[[vetulonic]]' shape, sometimes described as of the '''Negau type'''. They were buried in c. 50 BC, shortly before the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] invasion of the area. Helmets of the Negau type were typically worn by priests at the time of deposition of these helmets, so they seem to have been left at the Ženjak site for ceremonial reasons. The village of Ženjak was of great interest to German archaeologists during the [[Nazi]] period and was briefly renamed Harigast during [[World War II]]. The site has never been excavated properly.

==Inscriptions==
On one of the helmets ("Negau B"), there is an inscription in a [[Old Italic alphabet|northern Etruscan alphabet]]. The inscription need not date to c. 400 BC, but was possibly added by a later owner in c. 2nd century BC or later. It is read as:
&lt;!--:&lt;span dir=rtl &gt;[[Image:EtruscanH-01.png|12px|H]][[Image:EtruscanA-01.png|12px|A]][[Image:EtruscanR-01.png|12px|R]][[Image:EtruscanI-01.png|12px|I]][[Image:EtruscanK-01.png|12px|G]][[Image:EtruscanA-01.png|12px|A]][[Image:EtruscanS-01.png|12px|S]][[Image:EtruscanT-01.png|12px|T]][[Image:EtruscanI-01.png|12px|I]][[Image:EtruscanT-01.png|12px|T]][[Image:EtruscanE-01.png|12px|E]][[Image:EtruscanI-01.png|12px|I]][[Image:EtruscanF-01.png|12px|V]][[Image:EtruscanA-01.png|12px|A]]///[[Image:EtruscanI-01.png|12px|I]][[Image:EtruscanP-01.png|12px|P]]&lt;/span&gt;--&gt;
:{{lang|gem|{{script/Old Italic|𐌇𐌀𐌓𐌉𐌊𐌀𐌔𐌕𐌉𐌕𐌄𐌉𐌅𐌀///𐌉𐌐|rtl=y}}}}
:''harikastiteiva\\\ip'',
Many interpretations of the inscription have been proffered in the past, but the most recent interpretation is by T.L. Markey (2001), who reads the inscription as 'Harigast the priest' (from *''[[teiwaz]]'' "god"), as another inscribed helmet also found at the site bears several names (mostly [[Celt]]ic) followed by religious titles.

In any case, the Germanic name ''Harigast'' is almost universally read. Formerly, some scholars have seen the inscription as an early incarnation of the [[runic alphabet]], but it is now accepted that the script is North Etruscan proper, and precedes the formation of the Runic alphabet. ''Harigast'' constitutes an attestation of the [[Germanic sound shift]], probably the earliest preserved, preceding [[Tacitus]] perhaps by some two centuries.&lt;ref name="Smith2009"/&gt;

Must (1957) reads ''Hariχas Titieva'' as a [[Raetic]] personal name, the first element from the Indo-European ([[Venetic]] rather than Germanic), the second from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]].

The four discrete inscriptions on the helmet usually called "Negau A" are read by Markey as: ''Dubni banuabi'' 'of Dubnos the pig-slayer'; ''sirago turbi'' 'astral priest of the troop'; ''Iars'e esvii'' 'Iarsus the divine'; and ''Kerup'', probably an abbreviation for a Celtic name like Cerubogios.

The city is located at the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] entrance of the [[Panama Canal]], in the province of [[Panamá Province|Panama]]. The city is the political and administrative center of the country, as well as a hub for banking and commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesspanama.com/investing/opportunities/financial_service.php |title=Investing in Panama |publisher=BusinessPanama.com |accessdate=2010-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209220934/http://www.businesspanama.com/investing/opportunities/financial_service.php |archive-date=2010-12-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Panama was founded on August 15, 1519, by Spanish conquistador [[Pedro Arias Dávila]]. The city was the starting point for expeditions that conquered the Inca Empire in Peru. It was a stopover point on one of the most important trade routes in the American continent, leading to the fairs of [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]] and [[Portobelo, Colón|Portobelo]], through which passed most of the gold and silver that Spain took from the Americas.

On January 28, 1671, the original city (see [[Panamá Viejo]]) was destroyed by a fire when privateer [[Henry Morgan]] sacked and set fire to it. The city was formally reestablished two years later on January 21, 1673, on a peninsula located {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=in}} from the original settlement. The site of the previously devastated city is still in ruins.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
{{see also|Timeline of Panama City}}
[[File:Review of reviews and world's work (1890) (14597444780).jpg|thumb|right|The Old Quarter of Panama City, circa 1903]]
The city was founded on August 15, 1519, by [[Pedro Arias de Ávila]], also known as Pedrarias Dávila. Within a few years of its founding, the city became a launching point for the exploration and conquest of Peru and a transit point for gold and silver headed back to Spain through the Isthmus. In 1671 Henry Morgan with a band of 1400 men attacked and looted the city, which was subsequently destroyed by fire. The ruins of the old city still remain and are a popular tourist attraction known as Panamá la Vieja (Old Panama). The city was rebuilt in 1673 in a new location approximately {{convert|5|mi|0|abbr=out}} southwest of the original city. This location is now known as the Casco Viejo (Old Quarter) of the city.

One year before the start of the [[California Gold Rush]], the [[Panama Railroad Company]] was formed, but the railroad did not begin full operation until 1855. Between 1848 and 1869, the year the first transcontinental railroad was completed in the United States, about 375,000 persons crossed the isthmus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and 225,000 in the opposite direction. This traffic greatly increased the prosperity of the city during that period.

The construction of the Panama Canal was of great benefit to the infrastructure and economy. Of particular note are the improvements in health and sanitation brought about by the American presence in the Canal Zone.  Dr. [[William Gorgas]], the chief sanitary officer for the canal construction, had a particularly large impact. He hypothesized that diseases were spread by the abundance of mosquitos native to the area, and ordered the fumigation of homes and the cleansing of water. This led to yellow fever being eradicated by November 1905, as well malaria rates falling dramatically.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, most of the laborers for the construction of the canal were brought in from the Caribbean, which created unprecedented racial and social tensions in the city.

[[File:Southbound on the Panama Canal approaching the Centennial Bridge.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|The Panama Canal is one of the main attractions to the Panama City area. The Centennial Bridge spans the area near Gold Hill on the left and Contractor Hill on the right. This is the site of the highest elevation of the Panama Canal construction.]]

During World War II, construction of military bases and the presence of larger numbers of U.S. military and civilian personnel brought about unprecedented levels of prosperity to the city. Panamanians had limited access, or no access at all, to many areas in the Canal Zone neighboring the Panama city metropolitan area. Some of these areas were military bases accessible only to United States personnel. Some tensions arose between the people of Panama and the U.S. citizens living in the Panama Canal Zone. This erupted in the January 9, 1964 events, known as [[Martyrs' Day (Panama)|Martyrs' Day]].

In the late 1970s through the 1980s the city of Panama became an international banking center, bringing a lot of undesirable attention as an international money-laundering locale. In 1989 after nearly a year of tension between the United States and Panama, President [[George H. W. Bush]] ordered the [[invasion of Panama]] to depose General [[Manuel Noriega]], the country's de facto dictator. As a result, a portion of the [[El Chorrillo]] neighborhood, which consisted mostly of old wood-framed buildings dating back to the 1900s (though still a large slum area), was destroyed by fire.  In 1999, the United States officially transferred control of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama, which remains in control today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Panama Canal|url=http://www.history.com/topics/panama-canal|website=History|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Panama is still a banking center, although with very visible controls in the flow of cash. Shipping is handled through port facilities in the area of Balboa operated by the Hutchison Whampoa Company of Hong Kong and through several ports on the Caribbean side of the isthmus. Balboa, which is located within the greater Panama metropolitan area, was formerly part of the Panama Canal Zone, and the administration of the former Panama Canal Zone was headquartered there.

==Geography==

Panamá is located between the Pacific Ocean and tropical rain forest in the northern part of Panama. The ''[[Parque Natural Metropolitano]]'' (Metropolitan Nature Park), stretching from Panama City along the [[Panama Canal]], has unique bird species and other animals, such as [[tapir]], [[Cougar|puma]], and [[caimans]]. At the Pacific entrance of the canal is the ''Centro de Exhibiciones Marinas'' (Marine Exhibitions Center), a research center for those interested in tropical marine life and ecology, managed by the [[Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute]].

Tropical forests around Panama are vital for the functioning of the Panama Canal, providing it with the water required for its operation. Due to the canal's importance to the Panamanian economy, tropical forests around the canal have been kept in an almost pristine state; the canal is thus a rare example of a vast engineering project in the middle of a forest that helped to preserve that forest. Along the western side of the canal is the ''Parque Nacional Soberanía'' (Sovereignty National Park), which includes the Summit botanical gardens and a zoo. The best known trail in this national park is Pipeline Road, popular among birdwatchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canopytower.com/ |title=Canopy Tower, a famous birdwatchers hotel |publisher=Canopytower.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 500 rivers lace Panama's rugged landscape. Most are unnavigable; many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the Río Chepo and the Río Chagres, both within the boundaries of the city, work as sources of hydroelectric power.

The Río Chagres is one of the longest and most vital of the approximately 150 rivers that flow into the Caribbean. Part of this river was dammed to create Gatun Lake, which forms a major part of the transit route between the locks near each end of the canal. Both Gatun Lake and Madden Lake (also filled with water from the Río Chagres) provide hydroelectricity to the former Canal Zone area. The Río Chepo, another major source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific.

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Panama City has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw''), a little drier than a [[tropical monsoon climate]]. It sees {{convert|1900|mm|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually. The [[wet season]] spans from May through December, and the [[dry season]] spans from January through April. Temperatures remain constant throughout the year, averaging around {{convert|27|C|F}}. Sunshine is subdued in Panama because it lies in the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], where there is a nearly continual cloud formation, even during the dry season.

===Neighborhoods===
The city is located in [[Panama District]], although its metropolitan area also includes some populated areas on the opposite side of the Panama Canal. As in the rest of the country, the city is divided into ''[[corregimiento]]s'', in which there are many smaller boroughs. The old quarter, known as the ''Casco Viejo'', is located in the ''corregimiento'' of [[San Felipe, Panama|San Felipe]]. San Felipe and twelve other ''corregimientos'' form the [[urban center]] of the city, including Santa Ana, [[El Chorrillo]], Calidonia, Curundú, Ancón, Bella Vista, Bethania, San Francisco, Juan Diaz, Pueblo Nuevo, Parque Lefevre, and Río Abajo.

==Economy==
[[File:Panamá-C.jpg|thumb|Construction boom in Panama City.]]
[[File:Panama City financial district.jpg|thumb|Panama City financial district]]
As the economic and financial center of the country, Panama City's economy is [[Service economy|service-based]], heavily weighted toward banking, commerce, and tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panamatours.com/Facts/Useful%20Facts.htm |title=Panama Useful Facts |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy depends significantly on trade and shipping activities associated with the Panama Canal and [[port]] facilities located in [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]]. Panama's status as a convergence zone for capital from around the world due to the canal helped the city establish itself as a prime location for offshore banking and tax planning. Consequently, the economy has relied on accountants and lawyers who help global corporations navigate the regulatory landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/world/americas/panama-papers-leak-casts-light-on-a-law-firm-founded-on-secrecy.html|title=Panama Papers Leak Casts Light on a Law Firm Founded on Secrecy|last=Semple|first=Kirk|date=April 6, 2016|work=New York Times|access-date=November 14, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has benefited from significant economic growth in recent years, mainly due to the ongoing expansion of the Panama Canal, an increase in real estate investment, and a relatively stable banking sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/02/panama-economy-idUSN0214618620100302 |title=Panama economy grew 2.4 percent in 2009 |publisher=Reuters |date=2010-03-02 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are around eighty banks in the city, at least fifteen of which are national.

Panama City is responsible for the production of approximately 55% of the country's GDP. This is because most Panamanian businesses and premises are located in the city and its metro area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://municipio.gob.pa/ |title=Municipio de Panamá |publisher=Municipio.gob.pa |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a stopover for other destinations in the country, as well as a transit point and tourist destination in itself.

Tourism is one of the most important economic activities in terms of revenue generation. This sector of the economy has seen a great deal of growth since the transfer of the Panama Canal Zone at the end of the twentieth century. The number of hotel rooms increased by more than ten-fold, from 1,400 in 1997 to more than 15,000 in 2013, while the number of annual visitors increased from 457,000 in 1999 to 1.4 million in 2011.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/travel/panama-city-rising.html|title=Panama City Rising|last=Neville|first=Tim|date=May 3, 2013|work=New York Times|access-date=November 14, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's hotel occupancy rate has always been relatively high, reaching the second highest for any city outside the United States in 2008, after [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth, Australia]], and followed by [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panamarealestateinvestment.org/2008/05/06/panama-city-has-the-second-highest-hotel-occupancy-outside-of-the-united-states/ |title=Panama City Has The Second Highest Hotel Occupancy Outside Of The United States |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, hotel occupancy rates have dropped since 2009, probably due to the opening of many new luxury hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaledge.co.uk/news/hotel-occupancy-rates-see-sharp-drop-36008 |title=Hotel occupancy rates see sharp drop. |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several international hotel chains, such as [[Le Méridien]], [[Radisson Hotels|Radisson]], and [[RIU Hotels|RIU]], have opened or plan to open new hotels in the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpanama-hotel.com/twenty-two-hotels-are-under-construction-in-panama/ |title=Twenty-two Hotels are Under Construction in Panama. |accessdate=2011-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710184318/http://www.elpanama-hotel.com/twenty-two-hotels-are-under-construction-in-panama/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with those previously operating under [[Marriott International|Marriott]], [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]], [[InterContinental Hotels Group|InterContinental]], and other foreign and local brands.

===World Heritage Sites===
[[File:Archaeological Site of Panamá Viejo and Historic District of Panamá-111606.jpg|thumb|File:Archaeological Site of [[Panamá Viejo]]  and Historic District of Panamá]]

====Panamá Viejo====
{{main|Panamá Viejo}}

[[Panamá Viejo]] ("Old Panama")&lt;ref name="Panamaviejo"&gt;{{cite web
| url =http://www.panamaviejo.org/ | title =Panama Viejo| accessdate =July 18, 2010
| publisher =Patronato Panama Viejo }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name used for the architectural vestiges of the Monumental Historic Complex of the first Spanish city founded on the Pacific coast of the Americas by Pedro Arias de Avila on August 15, 1519. This city was the starting point for the expeditions that conquered the Inca Empire in Peru in 1532. It was a stopover point on one of the most important trade routes in the history of the American continent, leading to the famous fairs of Nombre de Dios and Portobelo, where most of the gold and silver that Spain took from the Americas passed through.&lt;ref name="World Heritage Site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/790 |title=UNESCO Official Site |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=1997-12-07 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Casco Viejo or Casco Antiguo====
{{main|Casco Viejo, Panama}}

Built and settled in 1671 after the destruction of Panama Viejo by the [[privateer]] [[Henry Morgan]], the historic district of Panama City (known as Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo, or San Felipe) was conceived as a walled city to protect its settlers against future pirate attacks. It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/790/|title=Archaeological Site of Panamá Viejo and Historic District of Panamá|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casco Antiguo displays a mix of architectural styles that reflect the country's cultural diversity: Caribbean, Republican, art deco, French, and colonial architecture mix in a site comprising around 800 buildings. Most of Panama City's main monuments are located in Casco Antiguo, including the Salón Bolivar, the National Theater (founded in 1908), Las Bóvedas, and Plaza de Francia. There are also many Catholic buildings, such as the Metropolitan Cathedral, the [[Virgin of Mercy|La Merced]] Church, and the [[Philip Neri|St. Philip Neri]] Church. The distinctive golden altar at [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]] Church was one of the few items saved from Panama Viejo during the 1671 pirate siege. It was buried in mud during the siege and then secretly transported to its present location.

; The Cinta Costera 3 in Casco Viejo
Undergoing [[redevelopment]], the old quarter has become one of the city's main tourist attractions, second only to the Panama Canal. Both government and private sectors are working on its restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,fdc48ceb-4b4e-427c-af4c-e3131de40e66.aspx |title=Panama Casco Viejo Blog – Panama News: World Bank invests in Cultural Industries for Casco Antiguo |publisher=Arcoproperties.com |date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116000514/http://www.arcoproperties.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,fdc48ceb-4b4e-427c-af4c-e3131de40e66.aspx |archive-date=2009-01-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Ricardo Martinelli]] built an extension to the Cinta Costera maritime highway viaduct in 2014 named "Cinta Costera 3" around the Casco Antiguo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cinta Costera]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Cinta Costera 3 project was built there were protests. Much of the controversy surrounding the project involved the possibility that Casco Viejo would lose its World Heritage status. On June 28, 2012, UNESCO decided that Casco Viejo will not be put on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Tourism===
Tourism in Panama City includes many different historic sites and locations related to the operation of the Panama Canal. A few of these sites are the following: 
* ''Las Bóvedas'' ("The Vaults"), a waterfront promenade jutting out into the Pacific;
* The National Institute of Culture Building and the French embassy across from it;
* The Cathedral at ''Plaza de la Catedral'';
* ''Teatro Nacional'' ([[National Theatre of Panama]]), an intimate performance center with outstanding natural acoustics and seating for about 800 guests;
* ''Museo del Canal Interoceánico'' (Interoceanic Canal Museum); and
* ''[[Palacio de las Garzas]]'' (Heron's Palace), the official name of the presidential palace, named for the numerous herons that inhabit the building.
* ''Miraflores Visitors Center'' at the Miraflores set of Locks on the Pacific Side, with a museum and a simulator of a ship cruising the canal.
* Calzada de Amador (Amador Causeway), a land-bridge built with rocks excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal. 
In addition to these tourist attractions, Panama City offers many different options when it comes to hotel accommodations, including the first Waldorf Astoria hotel to open in Latin America, and many small boutique style hotels that have smaller numbers of guest rooms and offer a more intimate vacation. Nightlife in the city is centered around the Calle Uruguay and Casco Viejo neighborhoods. These neighborhoods contain a variety of different bars and nightclubs that cater to the tourists visiting the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/17/travel/panama-city-luxury/index.html|title=Live large, pay small in Panama City - CNN.com|last=CNN|first=By Gabriel O'Rorke, for|website=CNN|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the newer tourist areas of the city is the area immediately east of the Pacific entrance of the canal, known as the Amador Causeway.&lt;!-- dead link: [http://www.thepanamareport.com/geeklog/public_html/article.php?story=20060222115335326 Jogging in Paradise...but where is everbody?

The United States State Department does not recommend traveling outside of the city due to the lack of accessibility to some areas and the prevalence of organized crime. Within the city, the State Department acknowledges the presence of crimes in the city, some of which include violent acts such as shootings, rape, armed robbery, and intentional kidnapping. The United States State Department also warns tourists about the purchasing of counterfeited or pirated goods, as they may be in violation of local Panamanian laws. In terms of LGBT rights in the city, same sex marriage is not recognized by the government but there are laws in place to prevent discrimination against the LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/panama.html|title=Panama|website=travel.state.gov|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery class="center"  widths=150px&gt;

Gelabert Airport is the main hub for AirPanama. All other flights are served by Tocumen.

There are frequent [[traffic jams]] in Panama City due to the high levels of private transport ownership per kilometre of traffic lane. In an attempt to curb traffic jams, President [[Ricardo Martinelli]] has brought forward the citywide [[Panama Metro]], initially {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=on}} long, stretching across the city.&lt;ref name="MetroPanama"&gt;{{cite web

The '''Peñol de Cerquín''' ({{IPA-es|peˈɲol de seɾˈkin}}): "'''Rock of Cerquín'''") was a mountaintop [[Lenca people|Lenca]] fortress in southern Honduras during the Contact Period (1520–1540).&lt;ref name="Gelliot&amp;c2011p1"&gt;Gelliot, Costa, Mercier, and Perrot-Minnot 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Peñol de Cerquín was a key Lenca stronghold during the Great Revolt of 1537 against the [[Spanish conquest of Honduras|Spanish conquest]].&lt;ref name="Gelliot s.d.p1"&gt;Gelliot undated, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The defences were formidable,&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Lenca warleader [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] strengthened the fortifications considerably, and used it as his base of operations. The hardened veteran Spanish ''[[conquistador]]es'' considered the fortress to be as strong as anything they had seen in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Spanish expedition to pass the Peñol was led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]] in early 1536, but he did not attempt an assault. A few months later Alvarado sent his lieutenant [[Juan de Chávez]] against the fortress; his initial assault was defeated, and the siege that followed it faltered due to supply problems. Over the next year, Spanish expeditions in the general region were moderately successful, and the Spanish considered the area pacified. Unknown to the Spanish, Lempira had been fortifying the Peñol in secret, and he amassed a great quantity of warriors and supplies there before openly declaring war in late 1537. The Spanish captain [[Alonso de Cáceres]] laid siege to the fortress at the beginning of November. In spring of 1538, Lempira agreed to a parley with the Spanish, and was shot dead during the negotiations. The surprise Spanish assault that followed quickly overran the demoralised defenders, and the fortress fell to the European invaders.

==Etymology==
''Cerquín'' was the name of an ancient Lenca province,&lt;ref name="Gelliot s.d.p1"/&gt; while ''peñol'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], meaning a rocky crag, or [[butte]].&lt;ref&gt;Royal Academia Española 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The Peñol de Cerquín is located in the southeast of the [[Lempira Department]] of [[Honduras]], in [[Central America]].&lt;ref name="Gelliot&amp;c2011p1"/&gt; The site lies within the [[Municipalities of Honduras|municipality]] of [[Erandique]].&lt;ref name="Gelliot&amp;c2011p7"&gt;Gelliot, Costa, Mercier, Perrot-Minnot 2011, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Peñol de Cerquín is to the south of the town, on the far side of the [[Sierra de las Neblinas]], in the region of the hamlet of San Antonio La Mina.&lt;ref name="Gelliot&amp;c2011p21"&gt;Gelliot, Costa, Mercier, Perrot-Minnot 2011, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The summit of the Peñol de Cerquín presents a ridge line with a surface area of approximately {{convert|4000|m2|sqft}}.&lt;ref name="Gelliot s.d.p1"/&gt; The available surface area was increased by narrow terraces supported by retaining walls on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Gelliot undated, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators Doris Stone and Federico Lunardi both described the site, and reported the presence of fortifications, retaining walls, and engraved rocks, as well as artefacts that included ceramic remains, [[metate]]s, and worked [[obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]].&lt;ref&gt;Gelliot undated, p. 1. Gelliot, Costa, Mercier, and Perrot-Minnot 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators in the 1940s climbed the Peñol and described finding the remains of a number of buildings, and the possible remains of a reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Gelliot, Costa, Mercier, and Perrot-Minnot 2011, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a quantity of rock art at the site, either engraved or picketed depending upon the form. Small oval and sub-circular [[petroglyph]]s were made using the picketing technique, while quadrangular forms and a spiral were cut into the rock with unbroken lines. A polychrome ceramic fragment is similar in style to [[Mesoamerican chronology#Late Classic era|Late Classic]] (c. 600–900 AD) [[Maya ceramics]] of the [[Copán]] valley, and the presence of petroglyphs suggest that the Peñol de Cerquín had an early history as a sacred site, later pressed into service as a fortress by Lempira.&lt;ref name="Gelliot s.d.p2"&gt;Gelliot undated, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish conquest==
{{main|Spanish conquest of Honduras}}
[[Pedro de Alvarado]] passed close to the Peñol de Cerquín in 1536, with eighty mixed Spanish infantry and cavalry, and some 3000 [[Indian auxiliaries|native Guatemalan auxiliaries]]. Alvarado was anxious to relieve a beleaguered Spanish garrison elsewhere, so he did not attempt an attack against the gathered warriors in what was obviously a strong fortification, and passed onwards without engaging the defenders.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, 1953, 1966, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; When Alvarado had established himself in the [[Naco, Honduras|Naco]] valley of Honduras, he sent his lieutenant Juan de Chávez southwards with 40–50 Spanish soldiers, and 1500–2000 native auxiliaries.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, 1953, 1966, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Chávez approached the Peñol de Cerquín towards the middle of 1536, to find it defended by a great many indigenous warriors who had gathered there to resist the Spanish. Chávez launched an assault against the fortress, but was beaten back before he could reach the base of the Peñol, so he laid siege to it. Chávez' force was short of supplies, and the natives had stripped the area of any food that the invaders could make use of. Given the strength of the fortress, his men became rebellious, and wished to return to their homes in Guatemala, and Chávez was forced to call off the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, 1953, 1966, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further Spanish expeditions in the general area were moderately successful, and they believed the region largely pacified.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1953, 1966,74, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Lenca warlord Lempira was secretly gathering a strong force of warriors at the Peñol, together with weapons and provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1953, 1996, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Lempira fortified the already formidable natural defences and, in late 1537, he openly declared war against the Spanish. The natives, including women and children, abandoned their villages and lands and gathered at the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1953, 1996, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The Peñol de Cerquín was crucial to Lempira's rebellion against the Spanish, and successful resistance there was a powerful symbol to indigenous peoples throughout the province of Honduras and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1953, 1996, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the open challenge to Spanish authority, [[Francisco de Montejo]], who had replaced Pedro de Alvarado as governor of Honduras,&lt;ref&gt;Olson and Shadle 1991, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; despatched his lieutenant [[Alonso de Cáceres]]  with eighty Spanish soldiers and a large number of native auxiliaries from Mexico and Guatemala. Cáceres arrived below the fortress around 1 November 1537. Cáceres immediately laid siege to the Peñol, hoping to starve the defenders into submission. There followed a series of attacks and counterattacks, and the Spanish closed the eight approaches to the mountain, although they were unable to make any advance. Five Spaniards died during the initial fighting, and many more were wounded, including Cáceres.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1953, 1966, pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Constant fighting dragged on for months, and the Spanish were unable to maintain supply lines through hostile territory and were often short of provisions. In spring of 1538 the rain season began, which added to the attackers' difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Desperate to bring the siege to a conclusion, Cáceres called a parley with Lempira. The Lenca general approached in full battle regalia, including feathered headdress and cotton armour. He refused Cáceres' demand that he submit, at which point a hidden Spanish [[arquebus]]ier shot Lempira through the head.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the signal for a surprise Spanish assault, which quickly overran the shocked and demoralised defenders. The Peñol de Cerquín rapidly fell to the invaders. Many warriors surrendered without further resistance, while a portion of them fled into the surrounding mountains. Many elderly, women, and children were also captured by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical documents==
The Peñol de Cerquín was described in a letter from ''conquistador'' Francisco de Montejo to the king of Spain, dated 10 June 1539. Also in 1539, Spanish bishop [[Cristóbal de Pedraza]] wrote a report that included the testimonies of various Spanish soldiers who had been present at the siege of the Peñol de Cerquín. In the early 17th century, [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]] produced his monumental [[Historia General de los Hechos de los Castellanos en las Islas y Tierra Firme del Mar Oceáno]], which included an account of the battle of Cerquín.&lt;ref&gt;Gelliot, Costa, Mercier, and Perrot-Minnot 2011, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
The area of the Peñol de Cerquín was investigated by Italian archaeologist [[Federico Lunardi]] in the 1940s, and by the American archaeologist [[Doris Zemurray Stone|Doris Stone]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Gelliot, Costa, Mercier, and Perrot-Minnot 2011, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; A French team led by Eric Gelliot carried out further investigations in 2011–2012.&lt;ref name="Gelliot s.d.p1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15317">{{Life in Cuba}}

The [[Cuban Revolution]] was not only fought by armed rebels on the battlefield but also through the propaganda campaigns designed and orchestrated by [[Fidel Castro]] and his rebel comrades. '''Propaganda in Cuba''' during revolution  included Castro's use of personal interviews with journalists, radio broadcasts and publicity seeking operations that contributed significantly to the victory of the rebels over [[Fulgencio Batista]]'s and provided insight into the successful propaganda campaign established by Castro after gaining power.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; The limited yet successful revolutionary propaganda apparatus transitioned into what Castro has called "one of the most potent weapons in his foreign policy arsenal." &lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;CIA, Cuba: Castro's Propaganda Apparatus and Foreign Policy, by CIA, restricted report (July 2003), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the Cuban government maintains an intricate propaganda machine that includes a global news agency, magazines, newspapers, broadcasting facilities, publishing houses, front groups, and other miscellaneous organizations that all stem from the modest beginnings of Castro's revolutionary propaganda machine.

==Revolutionary Propaganda==

===Historical Background===
After Fulgencio Batista took over control of the armed forces and reestablished his power in Cuba in 1952, Fidel Castro began his battle for social justice.&lt;ref name="Paul M. Sweezy 1960"&gt;Leo Huberman and Paul M. Sweezy, Cuba: Anatomy of a Revolution (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1960), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; As a 25-year-old lawyer, he went to Urgency Court and presented a brief outlining how Batista and his accomplices had violated six articles of the Code of Social Defense.&lt;ref name="Paul M. Sweezy 1960"/&gt;  When the court rejected his appeal to have Batista jailed for 106 years, Castro decided revolution was necessary.  Castro recruited a group of about 200 rebels consisting mostly of students or graduates in their twenties. On July 26, 1953, the "rebel" army attacked Moncada.&lt;ref name="Paul M. Sweezy 1960"/&gt; The attack ended in the brutal murders of many rebels.  While Fidel and his brother Raul Castro escaped, they were soon captured and imprisoned. Fidel was sentenced to 15 years in prison while Raul received 13 years.  After an intense public campaign for his release, Fidel Castro and his comrades were granted amnesty on May 15, 1955.&lt;ref name="Paul M. Sweezy 1960"/&gt; Shortly after in July 1955, Castro went to Mexico to gather arms and men for an invasion on Cuba.&lt;ref name="Paul M. Sweezy 1960"/&gt;  The small army boarded the Granma en route to Santiago de Cuba where they were to meet a rebel leader on November 30, 1956.&lt;ref name="Paul M. Sweezy 1960"/&gt;  The attack failed to go as planned, and Casto and his rebel army were forced to flee into the Sierra Maestra Mountains. Only 12 made it into the mountains including Raul Castro and Che Guevara. From atop the Sierra Maestra mountains, the rebels sought to gain domestic support for the revolution while winning over the international community (most notably the United States).

===Components===
The most important aspects of the revolutionary propaganda campaign include the use of radio broadcast on Radio Rebelde (Rebel Radio), personal interviews with journalists such as Herbert Matthews of the ''New York Times'', and publicity seeking operations such as the kidnapping of Argentine race car driver, Juan Manuel Fangio. Utilizing these means contributed to the overwhelming political victory of Fidel Castro and his revolutionary supporters in garnering domestic support and international acclaim.

====Personal Interviews====
The most notable and influential interviews were done by ''New York Times'' journalist [[Herbert Matthews]]. Matthews had gone to Sierra Maestra upon invitation by Castro in February 1957 and wrote three articles for the Times appearing on the 24th, 25th and 26th of the same month with the first two appearing on page one.&lt;ref name="William E. Ratliff 1987"&gt;William E. Ratliff, ed., The Selling of Fidel Castro: The Media and the Cuban Revolution (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books, 1987), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radio Rebelde====
[[File:Cheguevaracongo.jpg|thumb|Che Guevara Broadcasting]]
[[Radio Rebelde]] was part of the second phase of Castro and the rebels' propaganda campaign. Che Guevara set up a shortwave radio in the Sierra Maestra headquarters.&lt;ref name="CIA, Cuba 2003"&gt;CIA, Cuba: Castro's Propaganda Apparatus and Foreign Policy, by CIA, restricted report (July 2003), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The shortwave bypassed Eastern Cuba while reaching places like Venezuela. Soon countries such as Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador and Argentina were involved in the retransmission of the rebels' message.&lt;ref name="CIA, Cuba 2003"/&gt;  By 1968, Radio Rebelde reached as far as Washington D.C. and throughout the Caribbean Basin.&lt;ref name="CIA, Cuba 2003"/&gt;  The 150 watt broadcast put the Batista regime on the defensive and promoted the heroic impression of Castro abroad.

====Publicity Operations====
Radio Rebelde and the ''Times'' Articles contributed to international interest in the Cuban Revolution which Castro exploited at his full advantage. Castro granted other prominent news outlets the same personal interviews he gave Matthews. Argentina sent reporter Jorge Ricardo Masetti to interview Castro in 1958.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;CIA, Cuba: Castro's Propaganda Apparatus and Foreign Policy, by CIA, restricted report (July 2003), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the book ''Those Who Fight and Those Who Weep'' about his experience in Cuba and later returned to Cuba to head Castro's international press agency.  In addition to interviews, the rebels undertook paramilitary operations designed to gain international attention and promote the ineffectiveness of Batista's security forces.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The urban rebel force kidnapped famous race car driver Juan Manuel Fangio from a Havana hotel in broad daylight. Upon his release, Fangio spoke of the humane treatment he had received.  Later the rebels would kidnap a busload of American sailors and marines in order to pressure Batista to stop indiscriminate bombing of rebel villages. The idea was to get the United States to perceive the Batista regime as ineffective and savage. The propaganda campaign ultimately swayed the United States to halt all arms shipments to Batista in March 1958.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Post-Revolutionary Propaganda==

===Structure===
During the revolution, Fidel Castro created a propaganda structure that would serve as the foundation for propaganda dissemination after gaining power. He immediately began organizing an international media empire that included radio stations, a news agency with offices around the world, newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, "friendship" institutes and other organizations that were under direct control of the Cuban Communist Party's Political Bureau.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Castro was so entrenched in the daily nuances of the propaganda apparatus that he would personally visit editorial offices to check on stories in the party's daily newspaper ''Granma'' or visit the headquarters of Cuba's international news agency ''Prensa Latina'' to make statements on breaking news.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;CIA, Cuba: Castro's Propaganda Apparatus and Foreign Policy, by CIA, restricted report (July 2003), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Castro also wrote editorials on sensitive subject matter most often concerning the United States. The day-to-day components of the media empire were given to Antonio Perez Herrero who became head of the Revolutionary Orientation Department which outlined ideological guidelines of the party and made sure they were followed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Herrero and Department Chief Orlando Fundora Lopez often accompanied Castro abroad to ensure that tight control on the media was not loosened by distance.

===Components===

====Granma====
[[File:Granma 27-10-1978.JPG|thumb|Granma 27-10-1978]]
''Granma'' was set up to give Cubans a daily newspaper with international and domestic news stories while giving the Castro regime an internal propaganda outlet. .&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;William E. Ratliff, ed., The Selling of Fidel Castro: The Media and the Cuban Revolution (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books, 1987), 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the daily domestic distribution, ''Granma'' also publishes the ''Granma Weekly Review'' in English, French and Spanish for international distribution. The daily edition is only published in Spanish. Daily readers of ''Granma'' learned early on that the Castro regime supported the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and rebels fighting president Jose Napoleon Duarte in El Salvador.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  ''Granma'' readers were also aware of the regime's hatred for Israel, capitalism, and almost all things Western.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Readers never encountered stories of political executions, cultural repressions, the jailing of anti-Castro dissidents, the presence of Cuban soldiers in Africa or their deaths, the poor Cuban economy, and the dependence of the regime on the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  There was also no mention of the more than one million Cubans living in America. Recurring messages of Granma include the idea that the United States and all capitalist countries are greedy Nazi-like societies, that Cuba and all the revolutionary and socialists supporters are societies of moral and progressive citizens, and that because of the existence of good and evil nations, Marxist–Leninist Revolutions must happen all over the globe.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Ratliff, ed., The Selling of Fidel Castro: The Media and the Cuban Revolution (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books, 1987), 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prensa Latina====
One of the most important parts of the propaganda apparatus is ''Prensa Latina'' which not only disseminates Castro's propaganda worldwide, but it also works as a front for intelligence collection and operations. The idea for ''Prensa Latina'' was conceived in 1959 during Operation Truth when Fidel Castro gathered hundreds of journalists, mostly from Latin America, in Cuba to discuss what he called a conspiracy by European and American press.&lt;ref&gt;CIA, Cuba: Castro's Propaganda Apparatus and Foreign Policy, by CIA, restricted report (July 2003), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; While condemning Western press he told reporters, "The Latin American Press ought to have the means that would permit it to know the truth and not be victim of the lie."&lt;ref&gt;CIA, Cuba: Castro's Propaganda Apparatus and Foreign Policy, by CIA, restricted report (July 2003), 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Copies of ''Prensa Latina'' in English were sent to Egypt and Yugoslavia while Spanish copies were directed at Czechoslovakia and Poland. A year after it was created, ''Prensa Latina'' had offices in Washington, New York, London and Paris, Geneva and Prague as well as all Latin American countries except Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.  By 1972, it controlled two national and twelve international radio circuits, and by 1975, it distributed news materials in Quechua, a native Indian language used in Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;CIA, Cuba: Castro's Propaganda Apparatus and Foreign Policy, by CIA, restricted report (July 2003), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;''Prensa Latina'' also publishes extensive material on economic matters.

====International Radio Broadcast====
Before Castro, Cuba had no international shortwave radio broadcast, but in 1961, Radio Havana was created. Radio Havana is broadcast in eight languages to countries in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa and the Americas. The use of Radio Moscow's transmitters allow broadcast programs to reach Europe and the Mediterranean. Radio Havana's shortwave broadcasts are supplemented by medium wave broadcasts from La Voz de Cuba. An English version called the Voice of Cuba transmits in medium wave to North America. The regime also has a history of supporting subversive broadcasting efforts. Some of the most important and influential in Latin America include assisting Salvadoran insurgents with Radio Venceremos and Radio Farabundo Marti.&lt;ref&gt;CIA, Cuba: Castro's Propaganda Apparatus and Foreign Policy, by CIA, restricted report (July 2003), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cuban Institute for Friendship Among People (ICAP)====
The ICAP was established on December 30, 1960, to gain popular support in Europe and the United States in anticipation of a counterrevolutionary invasion by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;CIA, Cuba: Castro's Propaganda Apparatus and Foreign Policy, by CIA, restricted report (July 2003), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; ICAP organized foreigners into associations based on their country of origin such as Union of Peruvians in Cuba, Cuban-Spanish Friendship Society, The Cuban-Venezuelan Institute of Revolutionary Solidarity and The Association of Guatemalans Residing in Cuba. President of ICAP at the time, Rene Rodriguez Cruz admitted that the friendship organizations sponsored by the ICAP were used for Havana's propaganda purposes.&lt;ref&gt;CIA, Cuba: Castro's Propaganda Apparatus and Foreign Policy, by CIA, restricted report (July 2003), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; About 113 friendship organizations existed globally at the time. Members of the organization would hand out pro-Castro pamphlets, participate in marches and demonstrations and recruit foreign groups to come to Cuba.

====Casa de las Américas====
[[File:Casa de las Américas.JPG|thumb|left|Casa de las Américas]]
Casa de las Américas was established in April 1959 as a place where Castro could harness the propagandistic power of Latin American intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;CIA, Cuba: Castro's Propaganda Apparatus and Foreign Policy, by CIA, restricted report (July 2003), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, it organized a literary contest that awarded prizes to Latin American poets, authors and play-wrights. Also in 1960, it published a literary journal of the same name for poets and writers that provided a platform for political slant pieces. In addition to publishing winners of the literary contest, ''Casa'' also published book length material deemed important enough for widespread distribution. Perhaps the most important and influential piece published was Régis Debray's ''Revolution within the Revolution?'' in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;CIA, Cuba: Castro's Propaganda Apparatus and Foreign Policy, by CIA, restricted report (July 2003), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This book meant to complement Che Guevara's Bolivian uprising.

====Performing Arts====
[[File:Alicia Alonso 1955.jpg|thumb|Alicia Alonso 1955]]
Any avenue of performing arts was used to portray Cuban society in a favorable way. The Cuban National Ballet headed by prima ballerina, Alicia Alonso, is the flagship example of the propaganda machine.&lt;ref&gt;CIA, Cuba: Castro's Propaganda Apparatus and Foreign Policy, by CIA, restricted report (July 2003), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Alonso and the Ballet performed in places like Hanoi and Moscow as well as the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. After retiring from ballet, Alonso became the director of choreography.

'''''Red Tail Reborn''''' is a 2007 historical documentary film by Adam White about the [[Commemorative Air Force]]'s [[Red Tail Project]].  The project involves the restoration, exhibition and maintenance of a [[World War II]] [[P-51 Mustang]] flown by the [[United States Air Force]] [[332d Fighter Group]].  The exhibition of this plane is considered to be a traveling and flying tribute to the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]. In addition to increasing awareness of the travails of the Tuskegee Airmen, this film served to highlight the Red Tail Project fundraising effort to rebuild the plane after a 2004 crash.

The film was initially broadcast and released on DVD in 2007 in the director's home state of Ohio, winning local [[Emmy Award]] recognition.  The following year, it was broadcast nationally for the first time on [[Public Broadcasting Services]] (PBS) stations.  The film had a sequel called ''[[Flight of the Red Tail]]''.

==Story==
''Red Tail Reborn'' is described by [[AllMovie]] as "... the story of the brave African-American pilots who risked their lives in order to ensure that peace prevailed, and the people who have dedicated their lives to ensure that they are not forgotten."&lt;ref name=RTRAM/&gt; It tells three stories in one: the story of the Tuskegee Airmen, the history of the Red Tail Mustangs they flew (one of which is the subject of the restoration efforts) and the story of the late Don Hinz who crashed the first restored Mustang in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:DNWB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=12C60A2E440AF920&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=‘Red Tail Reborn’ to air on PBS Feb. 14|accessdate=January 25, 2010|date=February 12, 2008|newspaper=[[Wahpeton Daily News]]|author=Hevern, Erin C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film sheds light on the bravery and heroism of the Tuskegee Airmen in their service as [[bomber]] escorts for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] in the [[European Theatre of World War II]].&lt;ref name=RTRAM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/red-tail-reborn-471751|title=Red Tail Reborn|accessdate=January 1, 2010|publisher=Macrovision Corporation|work=[[AllMovie]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It documents that the Tuskegee Airmen were the country's first [[African American]] military aviators taking flight in World War II, despite contemporary stereotyping of African American men as lacking the essential intellectual and emotional qualities necessary to fly. The film even presents government documents deriding African American men as substandard and "cowards". It describes segregation endured by the African American military officers, and it describes how these pilots distinguished themselves with their record.&lt;ref name=SoTAtaoP/&gt;

It details the evolution of the Red Tail Project mission and the re-dedication to this enthusiasm when the mission's leader perished while flying a plane in homage to the Tuskegee Airmen.&lt;ref name=RTRAM/&gt;  This includes an explanation of the provenance of the plane and the various restoration efforts that led up to the Red Tail Project.&lt;ref name=RTR&gt;''Red Tail Reborn'', 2007, Hemlock Films.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those that Cleveland filmmaker White interviewed to make the film were 13 of the Tuskegee airmen. Several of the Tuskegee Airmen were from the northeast Ohio region.&lt;ref name=SoTAtaoP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:RCOC&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1249C9E31EB73860&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Story of Tuskegee Airmen to air on PBS|accessdate=January 1, 2010|date=February 5, 2008|work=[[The Repository]]|author=Goshay, Charita M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the veterans interviewed was [[Colonel]] [[Charles McGee (pilot)|Charles McGee]], who had served in World War II, the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]] and whom White said had more combat flight hours than any other American.&lt;ref name=SoTAtaoP/&gt;  The film was shot in [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], Montana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795451/trivia|title=Trivia for Red Tail Reborn (2007)|accessdate=December 31, 2009|publisher=[[IMDb.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film was produced to help increase awareness and elicit financial support for The Red Tail Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:PVPB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=122C82194515A2C0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Red Tail Project takes flight again|accessdate=January 1, 2010|date=August 22, 2008|author=Doss, Robert|work=[[Palos Verdes Peninsula News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was produced by Cleveland-based Hemlock Films, which is White's production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hemlockfilms.com/html/news___links.html |title=Film Maker To Speak At Aviation Hall Of Fame Dec. 17TH Event |accessdate=March 21, 2010 |publisher=Hemlock Films |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429233021/http://hemlockfilms.com/html/news___links.html |archivedate=April 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was underwritten by the [[Parker Hannifin|Parker Hannifin Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westernreservepublicmedia.org/images/presreport_winter08.pdf |title=Western Reserve Public Media |accessdate=March 21, 2010 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was inspired while White was filming ''[[The Restorers]]'', after a [[P-51 Mustang|P-51C Mustang]] landed for refueling and White met Doug Rozendaal, the pilot of the Red Tail Project's ''Tuskegee Airmen'' plane.  When White heard Don Hinz had been killed in a crash of that very same plane, he felt compelled to do a story focusing on it. Once he got involved in the project, a local PBS station committed to airing the final product, which was an early step in the successful development of the project.  When researching the film he noticed a lack of resources about the Tuskegee Airmen and felt driven to fill the void.&lt;ref name=RTRPBS/&gt;

The DVD release includes a second disc with four hours of additional interviews, deleted scenes, and productions stills. A reviewer from ''[[Flight Journal]]'', feels the DVD package will connect with an audience of actual and aspiring restorers of military combat aircraft, which sometimes referred to as warbirds.  It notes that the narrator, Michael Dorn, is a warbird owner and pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redtailreborn.com/html/reviews.html |title=Flight Journal |author=Farmer, James |accessdate=January 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516093224/http://www.redtailreborn.com/html/reviews.html |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''religious views of Thomas Jefferson''' diverged widely from the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Christianity]] of his era. Throughout his life, [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] was intensely interested in [[theology]], [[religious studies]], and [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom p 366&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sanford, ''The Religious Life of Thomas Jefferson'' (Charlotte: UNC Press, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;
Jefferson was most comfortable with [[Deism]], [[Age of Enlightenment|rational religion]], and [[Unitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Corbett and Julia Mitchell Corbett, ''Politics and religion in the United States'' (1999) p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; He was sympathetic to and in general agreement with the ''moral'' precepts of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Scherr, Arthur.  [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/church-history/article/thomas-jefferson-versus-the-historians-christianity-atheistic-morality-and-the-afterlife/3BCF349BFA2B263498D0AC341FCAC8F0 "Thomas Jefferson Versus the Historians: Christianity, Atheistic Morality, and the Afterlife."] ''Cambridge University Press''.  7 March 2014.  3 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the teachings of Jesus as having "the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man,"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Augustine|Jefferson, Washington, 1907]], p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; yet he held that the pure teachings of Jesus appeared to have been appropriated by some of Jesus' early followers, resulting in a Bible that contained both "diamonds" of wisdom and the "dung" of ancient political agendas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/jesus/jefferson.html Thomas Jefferson and his Bible] April, 1998, PBS Frontline, downloaded 15-04-03&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson held that "acknowledging and adoring an overruling providence" (as in his First Inaugural Address&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~tjpapers/inaugural/infinal.html Thomas Jefferson, First Inaugural Address]&lt;/ref&gt;) was important and in his second inaugural address, expressed the need to gain "the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old".&lt;ref name="divine interventionism"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres17.html Thomas Jefferson, Second Inaugural Address], Monday, March 4, 1805&lt;/ref&gt; Still, together with [[James Madison]], Jefferson carried on a long and successful campaign against state financial support of churches in Virginia. Also, it is Jefferson who coined the phrase "[[Separation of church and state in the United States|wall of separation between church and state]]" in his [[wikisource:Letter to the Danbury Baptists - January 1, 1802|1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists]] of [[Connecticut]]. During his [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800 campaign]] for the presidency, Jefferson even had to contend with critics who argued that he was unfit to hold office because of their discomfort with his "unorthodox" religious beliefs.

Jefferson used certain passages of the New Testament to compose ''[[Jefferson Bible|The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth]]'' (the "Jefferson Bible"), which excluded any [[miracle]]s by Jesus and stressed his moral message. Though he often expressed his opposition to many practices of the clergy, and to many specific popular Christian doctrines of his day, Jefferson repeatedly expressed his admiration for Jesus as a ''moral'' teacher, and consistently referred to himself as a Christian (though following his own unique type of Christianity) throughout his life. Jefferson opposed [[Calvinism]], [[Trinitarianism]], and what he identified as [[Platonism#Christianity and Platonism|Platonic elements in Christianity]]. In private letters Jefferson also described himself as subscribing to other certain philosophies, in addition to being a Christian.  In these letters he described himself as also being an "[[Epicureanism|Epicurean]]" (1819),&lt;ref name=1819Short&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.constitution.org/tj/jeff15.txt |work=The Writings of Thomas Jefferson |editor=Albert Ellery Bergh |year=1853 |page=219 |title=October 31, 1819 letter to William Short |publisher=The Thomas Jefferson Memorial Association |accessdate=2009-05-23 |quote=As you say of yourself, I too am an Epicurian.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon the disestablishment of religion in Connecticut, he wrote to [[John Adams]]: "I join you, therefore, in sincere congratulations that this den of the priesthood is at length broken up, and that a Protestant Popedom is no longer to disgrace the American history and character."&lt;ref&gt;''Works'', Vol. iv., p.&amp;nbsp;301.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church attendance==
Jefferson was raised in the [[Church of England]] at a time when it was the [[State religion|established church]] in Virginia and only denomination funded by Virginia tax money. Before the Revolution, parishes were units of local government, and Jefferson served as a [[vestryman]], a lay administrative position in his local parish. Office-holding qualifications at all levels—including the [[Virginia House of Burgesses]], to which Jefferson was elected in 1769—required affiliation with the current state religion and a commitment that one would neither express dissent nor do anything that did not conform to church doctrine. Jefferson counted clergy among his friends, and he contributed financially to the Anglican Church he attended regularly.

Following the Revolution, the Church of England in America was disestablished. It reorganized as the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church in America]]. [[Margaret Bayard Smith]], whose husband was a close friend of Jefferson, records that during the first winter of Jefferson's Presidency he "regularly attended service on" Sunday in a small humble Episcopalian church out of respect for public worship.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Margaret Bayard.  [https://archive.org/details/firstfortyyears00huntgoog "The first forty years of Washington society, portrayed by the family letters of Mrs. Samuel Harrison Smith (Margaret Bayard) from the collection of her grandson, J. Henley Smith."] ''Internet Archive''.  5 October 2016.  p.13&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only church in the new city, with the exception of a little Catholic chapel. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the House of Representatives, a custom which had not yet begun while he was Vice President, and which featured preachers of every Christian sect and denomination.

In "January 1806, a female evangelist, Dorothy Ripley, delivered a camp meeting-style exhortation in the House to Jefferson, Vice President Aaron Burr, and a 'crowded audience.' Throughout his administration Jefferson permitted church services in executive branch buildings," which "were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel06-2.html |title=Religion and the Federal Government: PART 2 |publisher=Library of Congress Exhibition}} (Religion and the Founding of the American Republic)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry S. Randall]], the only biographer permitted to interview Jefferson's immediate family, recorded that Jefferson "attended church with as much regularity as most of the members of the congregation—sometimes going alone on horse-back, when his family remained at home", and that he also "contributed freely to the erection of Christian churches, gave money to Bible societies and other religious objects, and was a liberal and regular contributor to the support of the clergy. Letters of his are extant which show him urging, with respectful delicacy, the acceptance of extra and unsolicited contributions, on the pastor of his parish, on occasions of extra expense to the latter, such as the building of a house."&lt;ref&gt;[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044021591532;view=plaintext;seq=575;q1=church;start=1;size=100;page=root;orient=0;num=555 Henry S. Randall, ''The life of Thomas Jefferson''], p. 555&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Jefferson refused to serve as a godparent for infants being baptized, because he did not believe in the [[dogma]] of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name=Holmes2006 &gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ml9GsreUwEAC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;q=jefferson+godparent+trinity+deists+unitarian |title=The Faiths of the Founding Fathers |first=David ynn |last=Holmes |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-530092-5  |pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite testimony of Jefferson's church attendance, there is no evidence that he was ever confirmed or was a [[communicant]].&lt;ref name="holmes.lecture"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monticello.org/streaming/speakers/transcripts/religion.html|first=David|last=Holmes |title=Monticello Speakers Forum: Thomas Jefferson and Religion|publisher=Thomas Jefferson Foundation|accessdate=2008-04-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020102127/http://monticello.org/streaming/speakers/transcripts/religion.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jefferson and Deism==
[[File:USA declaration independence.jpg|thumb|right|The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]]]

In 1760, at age 16, Jefferson entered the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], and for two years he studied mathematics, metaphysics, and philosophy under Professor [[William Small]]. He introduced the enthusiastic Jefferson to the writings of the [[Empiricism#British empiricism|British Empiricists]], including [[John Locke]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref&gt;Merrill D. Peterson, ed. ''Thomas Jefferson: Writings'', p. 1236&lt;/ref&gt;
Jefferson biographers say that he was influenced by [[Deism|deist philosophy]] while at William &amp; Mary, particularly by [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]].&lt;ref name=Dulles2005&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/08/the-deist-minimum--28 |first=Avery |last=Dulles |authorlink=Avery Dulles |title=The Deist Minimum |journal=First Things |issue=149 |date=January 2005 |pages=25+ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230193737/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/08/the-deist-minimum--28 |archivedate=2010-12-30 |df= }}

Phrases such as "Nature's God", which Jefferson used in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], are typical of Deism, although they were also used at the time by non-Deist thinkers, such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]. In addition, it was part of Roman thinking about [[natural law]], and Jefferson was influenced by reading [[Cicero]] on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;

Most deists denied the Christian concepts of miracles and the [[Trinity]]. Though he had a lifelong esteem for Jesus' moral teachings, Jefferson did not believe in miracles, nor in the divinity of Jesus. In a letter to deRieux in 1788, he declined a request to act as a godfather, saying he had been unable to accept the doctrine of the Trinity "from a very early part of my life".&lt;ref name=Holmes2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

I am a [[Materialism|Materialist]]; he takes the side of Spiritualism; he preaches the efficacy of repentance toward forgiveness of sin; I require a counterpoise of good works to redeem it."&lt;ref&gt;The character of Thomas Jefferson: as exhibited in his own writings By Theodore Dwight, Pg. 363&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824, four years later, Jefferson had changed on his view of the "materialism" of Jesus, clarifying then that "... the founder of our religion, was unquestionably a materialist as to man."&lt;ref&gt;The Battle for the American Mind: A Brief History of a Nation's Thought By Carl J. Richard, Pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://founders.archives.gov/?q=%20Author%3A%22Jefferson%2C%20Thomas%22%20jesus%20materialist&amp;s=1111311111&amp;r=4 Letter from Jefferson to Augustus Elias Brevoort Woodward, 24 March 1824] Downloaded 15-04-22, National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson was directly linked to deism in the writings of some of his contemporaries. Patrick Henry's widow wrote in 1799, "I wish the Grate Jefferson &amp; all the Heroes of the Deistical party could have seen my... Husband pay his last debt to nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring09/deism.cfm |title=DEISM: One Nation Under A Clockwork God? |first=James |last=Breig |publisher=Colonial Williamsburg |date=Spring 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avery Dulles]], a leading [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] theologian, states that while at the [[College of William &amp; Mary]], "under the influence of several professors, he [Jefferson] converted to the deist philosophy".&lt;ref name=Dulles2005 /&gt; Dulles concludes:

{{quote|In summary, then, Jefferson was a deist because he believed in one God, in divine providence, in the divine moral law, and in rewards and punishments after death; but did not believe in supernatural revelation. He was a Christian deist because he saw Christianity as the highest expression of natural religion and Jesus as an incomparably great moral teacher. He was not an orthodox Christian because he rejected, among other things, the doctrines that Jesus was the promised [[Messiah]] and the incarnate [[Son of God]]. Jefferson's religion is fairly typical of the American form of deism in his day.}} Dulles concurs with historian Stephen Webb, who states that Jefferson's frequent references to "Providence" indicate his Deism, as "most eighteenth-century deists believed in providence".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H. Webb, ''American providence: a nation with a mission'' (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=fCmo6zYUDYoC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=deism+providence+Jefferson+inauthor:webb&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NWViTaX1NpSmsQPzwYCfDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=deism%20providence%20Jefferson%20inauthor%3Awebb&amp;f=false p. 35]&lt;/ref&gt;

While many biographers, as well as some of his contemporaries, have characterized Jefferson as a Deist, historians and scholars have not found any such self-identification in Jefferson's surviving writings. In an 1803 letter to Priestley, Jefferson praises Jesus for a form of deism.&lt;ref name=1803Priestley&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.constitution.org/tj/jeff10.txt |year=1803 |title=April 9, 1803 letter to Dr. Joseph Priestley |location=Washington |work=The Writings of Thomas Jefferson |author=Thomas Jefferson |editor=H.A. Washington (1861) |publisher=H.W. Derby }}

{{quote|... In consequence of some conversation with Dr. Rush, in the year 1798-99, I had promised some day to write him a letter giving him my view of the Christian system.  I have reflected often on it since, and even sketched the outlines in my own mind.  I should first take a general view of the moral doctrines of the most remarkable of the ancient philosophers, of whose ethics we have sufficient information to make an estimate, say [[Pythagoras]], [[Epicurus]], [[Epictetus]], [[Socrates]], Cicero, [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Antoninus (philosopher)|Antoninus]].  I should do justice to the branches of morality they have treated well; but point out the importance of those in which they are deficient.  I should then take a view of the deism and ethics of the Jews, and show in what a degraded state they were, and the necessity they presented of a reformation.  '''I should proceed to a view of the life, character, and doctrines of Jesus, who sensible of incorrectness of their ideas of the Deity, and of morality, endeavored to bring them to the principles of a pure deism, and juster notions of the attributes of God, to reform their moral doctrines to the standard of reason, justice and philanthropy, and to inculcate the belief of a future state.  This view would purposely omit the question of his divinity, and even his inspiration.  To do him justice, it would be necessary to remark the disadvantages his doctrines had to encounter, not having been committed to writing by himself, but by the most unlettered of men, by memory, long after they had heard them from him; when much was forgotten, much misunderstood, and presented in every paradoxical shape.'''  Yet such are the fragments remaining as to show a master workman, and that his system of morality was the most benevolent and sublime probably that has been ever taught, and consequently more perfect than those of any of the ancient philosophers.  His character and doctrines have received still greater injury from those who pretend to be his special disciples, and who have disfigured and sophisticated his actions and precepts, from views of personal interest, so as to induce the unthinking part of mankind to throw off the whole system in disgust, and to pass sentence as an impostor on the most innocent, the most benevolent, the most eloquent and sublime character that ever has been exhibited to man...}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
He expressed similar ideas in an 1817 letter to John Adams.&lt;ref name=1817Adams&gt;

If by religion we are to understand [i.e., to mean] sectarian dogmas, in which no two of them agree, then your exclamation on that hypothesis is just, 'that this would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it.' But if the moral precepts, innate in man, and made a part of his physical constitution, as necessary for a social being, '''if the sublime doctrines of philanthropism and deism taught us by Jesus of Nazareth,''' in which all agree, constitute true religion, then, without it, this would be, as you again say, 'something not fit to be named even, indeed, a hell'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disestablishment of religion in Virginia ==&lt;!-- this section deals only with TJ's efforts to ensure religion was disestablished in VA. His views on separation of Church &amp; State &amp; the First Amendment are treated in a later section--&gt;
[[Image:Thomas Jefferson's Grave Site.jpg|thumb|right|Jefferson's tombstone.  The inscription, as he stipulated, reads ''Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author of the [[Declaration of American Independence]], of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom, and father of the [[University of Virginia]].'']]
For Jefferson, [[separation of church and state]] was a necessary reform of the religious tyranny whereby a religion received state endorsement, and those not of that religion were denied rights, and even punished.

Following the Revolution, Jefferson played a leading role in the disestablishment of religion in Virginia. Previously as the established state church, the Anglican Church received tax support and no one could hold office who was not an Anglican. The Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist churches did not receive tax support. As Jefferson wrote in his ''Notes on Virginia'', pre-Revolutionary colonial law held that "if a person brought up a Christian denies the being of a God, or the Trinity ... he is punishable on the first offense by incapacity to hold any office."&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, Thomas.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=DTWttRSMtbYC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=%22he+is+punishable+on+the+first+offense+by+incapacity+to+hold+any+office.%22+notes+on+virginia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fa44pfNpQr&amp;sig=SBk0O3BPEkGE-69tQs-8JPeLg-U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgxJ7nio7UAhVKyoMKHaT3AxUQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22he%20is%20punishable%20on%20the%20first%20offense%20by%20incapacity%20to%20hold%20any%20office.%22%20notes%20on%20virginia&amp;f=false "Notes on the State of Virginia."] ''Google Books''.  26 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1779 Jefferson proposed "The [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]]", which was adopted in 1786. Its goal was complete separation of church and state; it declared the opinions of men to be beyond the jurisdiction of the civil magistrate. He asserted that the mind is not subject to coercion, that civil rights have no dependence on religious opinions, and that the opinions of men are not the concern of civil government. This became one of the American charters of freedom. This elevated declaration of the freedom of the mind was hailed in Europe as "an example of legislative wisdom and liberality never before known".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fPQfNx2TQLAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA45&amp;lpg=RA1-PA45&amp;dq=%22an+example+of+legislative+wisdom+and+liberality+ |first=Richard |last=Price |date=July 26, 1786 |title=''The Correspondence of Richard Price''.

From 1784 to 1786, Jefferson and [[James Madison]] worked together to oppose [[Patrick Henry]]'s attempts to assess general taxes in Virginia to support churches. In 1786, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed Jefferson's [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom|''Bill for Religious Freedom'']], which he had first submitted in 1779. It was one of only three accomplishments he put in his epitaph. The law read:

{{quote|No man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burdened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill D. Peterson, ed., ''Thomas Jefferson: Writings'' (1984), p. 347&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his 1787 ''Notes on the State of Virginia'', Jefferson stated:

{{quote|Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites; to support roguery and error all over the earth. ... Our sister states of Pennsylvania and New York, however, have long subsisted without any establishment at all. The experiment was new and doubtful when they made it. It has answered beyond conception. They flourish infinitely. Religion is well supported; of various kinds, indeed, but all good enough; all sufficient to preserve peace and order: or if a sect arises, whose tenets would subvert morals, good sense has fair play, and reasons and laughs it out of doors, without suffering the state to be troubled with it. They do not hang more malefactors than we do. They are not more disturbed with religious dissensions. On the contrary, their harmony is unparalleled, and can be ascribed to nothing but their unbounded tolerance, because there is no other circumstance in which they differ from every nation on earth. They have made the happy discovery, that the way to silence religious disputes, is to take no notice of them. Let us too give this experiment fair play, and get rid, while we may, of those tyrannical laws.&lt;ref&gt;

== Accusations of being an infidel ==
During the [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800 presidential campaign]], the ''New England Palladium'' wrote, "Should the infidel Jefferson be elected to the Presidency, the seal of death is that moment set on our holy religion, our churches will be prostrated, and some infamous 'prostitute', under the title of [[Cult of Reason|goddess of reason]], will preside in the sanctuaries now devoted to the worship of the most High."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Federalist]]s attacked Jefferson as a "howling atheist" and [[infidel]], claiming that his attraction to the religious and political extremism of the [[French Revolution]] disqualified him from public office.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time, calling a person an infidel could mean a number of things, including that they did not believe in God. It was an accusation commonly levelled at Deists, although they believe in a deity. It was also directed at those thought to be harming the Christian faith in which they were raised.

While opposed to the institutions of organized religion, Jefferson consistently expressed his belief in God. For example, he invoked the notion of divine justice in 1782 in his opposition to slavery,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/jefferson/ch18.html |title=Notes on the State of Virginia, Q.XVIII |year=1782 |quote=This is so true, that of the proprietors of slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labour.  And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God?  That they are not to be violated but with his wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just: that his justice can not sleep forever: that considering numbers, nature and natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange of situation is among possible events: that it may become probable by supernatural interference!"}}&lt;/ref&gt; and invoked divine Providence in his second inaugural address.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres17.html "Jefferson's Second Inaugural Address"], Bartleby Quotes&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson did not shrink from questioning the existence of God. In a 1787 letter to his nephew and ward, Peter Carr, who was at school, Jefferson offered the following advice:

{{quote|Fix Reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve the homage of reason than of blindfolded fear. ... Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its consequences. If it end in a belief that there is no God, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its exercise and in the love of others which it will procure for you.|Jefferson's Works, Vol. V., p. 322&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/jefferson_carr.html |title= 1787 letter to nephew Peter Carr|year=1787}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following the 1800 campaign, Jefferson became more reluctant to have his religious opinions discussed in public.  He often added requests at the end of personal letters discussing religion that his correspondents be discreet regarding its contents.&lt;ref name=1803Rush&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.constitution.org/tj/jeff10.txt |work=The Writings of Thomas Jefferson |editor=Albert Ellery Bergh |publisher=The Thomas Jefferson Memorial Association |year=1853 |page=379 |title=April 21, 1803 letter to Doctor Benjamin Rush | accessdate=2009-05-23 |quote=... To the corruptions of Christianity I am, indeed, opposed; but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself.

And in confiding it [an enclosed syllabus] to you, I know it will not be exposed to the malignant perversions of those who make every word from me a text for new misrepresentations and calumnies. I am moreover averse to the communication of my religious tenets to the public; because it would countenance the presumption of those who have endeavored to draw them before that tribunal, and to seduce public opinion to erect itself into that inquisition over the rights of conscience, which the laws have so justly proscribed.... |volume=X}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Separation of church and state ==
Jefferson sought what he called a "wall of separation between Church and State", which he believed was a principle expressed by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Jefferson's phrase has been cited several times by the Supreme Court in its interpretation of the [[Establishment Clause]], including in cases such as ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' (1878), ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' (1947), and ''[[McCollum v. Board of Education]]'' (1948).

In an 1802 letter to the [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] [[Baptist]] Association, he wrote:

{{quote|Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof", thus building a [[Separation of church and state in the United States|wall of separation]] between church and State.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Letter to the Danbury Baptists - January 1, 1802]], January 1, 1802&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Jefferson's March 4, 1805, Drafts of Address of Second Inaugural he stated:

{{quote|In matters of religion, I have considered that its free exercise is placed by the constitution independent of the powers of the general government. I have therefore undertaken, on no occasion, to prescribe the religious exercises suited to it; but have left them, as the constitution found them, under the direction and discipline of state or church authorities acknowledged by the several religious societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mtj:@field(DOCID+@lit(tj100059)) | title=Draft of 2nd Inaugural | accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Regarding the choice of some governments to regulate religion and thought, Jefferson stated:

{{quote|The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others.  But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god.  It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lva.lib.va.us/whatwedo/k12/psd/colony/tjnotes.htm Notes on the State of Virginia]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Deriving from this statement, Jefferson believed that the Government's relationship with the Church should be indifferent, religion being neither persecuted nor given any special status.

{{quote|If anything pass in a religious meeting seditiously and contrary to the public peace, let it be punished in the same manner and no otherwise as it had happened in a fair or market&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Jeffersonian Cyclopedia: a Comprehensive Collection of the Views of Thomas Jefferson |last=Jefferson |first=Thomas |editor=John P. Foley | year=1900 |publisher=Funk and Wagnalls |location=New York City |pages=140 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icGh3NxREIIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though he did so as Governor of Virginia, during his Presidency Jefferson refused to issue proclamations calling for days of prayer and thanksgiving.  In a letter to Samuel Miller dated January 23, 1808, Jefferson stated:

{{quote|But it is only proposed that I should recommend, not prescribe a day of fasting &amp; prayer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mtj:@field(DOCID+@lit(tj110010))]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, in ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'', Jefferson supported "a perpetual mission among the Indian tribes" by the Christian [[Brafferton (building)|Brafferton]] institution, at least in the interest of [[anthropology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefBv021.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=1&amp;division=div1 University of Virginia Library, ''Jefferson's Notes on Virginia''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221151907/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefBv021.sgm&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=1&amp;division=div1 |date=2011-02-21 }}, p. 210
&lt;/ref&gt;
As president, he sanctioned financial support for a priest and church for the [[Kaskaskia]] Indians, who were at the time already Christianized and baptized. [[Edwin Gaustad]] wrote that this was a pragmatic political move aimed at stabilizing relations with the Indian tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin S. Gaustad, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jZsvTcwV2wwC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sworn of the Altar of God: A Religious Biography of Thomas Jefferson]'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson also publicly affirmed "acknowledging and adoring an overruling providence" by the nation in his First Inaugural Address,&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"/&gt;
and in his Second Inaugural Address expressed his need of "the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old", and thus asked the nation "to join in supplications" with him to God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres17.html Thomas Jefferson, Second Inaugural Address]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter written to [[Mordecai Manuel Noah]] in 1818, Jefferson wrote that America was unique in that it put all religious sects "on an equal footing". This insured that no single religion had state-sponsored domination over any other.  However, the state could only do so much; in the same letter, he said that it is up to individuals to behave with religious tolerance towards their neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, Thomas. "Jefferson to M. M. Noah, 28 May 1818." ''What Did They Think of the Jews?'', edited by Allan Gould, Jason Aronson, 1991.  p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jefferson, Jesus, and the Bible==
{{further|Jefferson Bible}}
Jefferson's views on Jesus and the Bible were mixed, but were progressively far from what was and is largely considered orthodox in [[Christianity]]. Jefferson stated in a letter in 1819, "You say you are a Calvinist. I am not. I am of a sect by myself, as far as I know."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Letter_from_Thomas_Jefferson_to_Ezra_Styles_June_25_1819 Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Ezra Stiles Ely, June 25, 1819], ''Encyclopedia Virginia''&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejected the idea of the divinity of Christ, but as he wrote to William Short on October 31, 1819, he was convinced that the fragmentary teachings of Jesus constituted the "outlines of a system of the most sublime morality which has ever fallen from the lips of man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/jeffersons-religious-beliefs|title=Jefferson's Religious Beliefs |publisher=monticello.org|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On one hand Jefferson affirmed, "We all agree in the obligation of the moral precepts of Jesus, and nowhere will they be found delivered in greater purity than in his discourses,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/tj/jeff12.txt Thomas Jefferson, ''The Writings of Thomas Jefferson''], Alberty Ellery Bergh, editor (Washington D.C.: The Thomas Jefferson Memorial Association, 1904), Vol. XII, p. 315, to James Fishback, September 27, 1809&lt;/ref&gt; that he was "sincerely attached to His doctrines in preference to all others,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7yp1S0B9lgC&amp;q=attached+to+His+doctrines+in+preference+to+all+others#v=snippet&amp;q=attached%20to%20His%20doctrines%20in%20preference%20to%20all%20others&amp;f=false Thomas Jefferson, ''Memoirs, correspondence and private papers of Thomas Jefferson''], Volume 3; Letter to Benjamin rush, April 21, 1803&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the doctrines of Jesus are simple, and tend all to the happiness of man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/tj/jeff15.txt Thomas Jefferson, ''The Writings of Thomas Jefferson''],  Vol. XII,  p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jefferson considered much of the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]] to be false.  In a letter to William Short in 1820, Jefferson described many biblical passages as "so much untruth, charlatanism and imposture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z-pv0i1qHIYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA329&amp;lpg=RA1-PA329&amp;dq=so+much+untruth,+charlatanism+and+imposture |title=Memoirs, Correspondence, and Private Papers of Thomas Jefferson: Late President of the United States|author=Thomas Jefferson &amp; Thomas Jefferson Randolph|publisher=H. Colburn and R. Bentley|location=London|year=1829|oclc=19942206|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same letter Jefferson states he describes [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] as the "first corrupter of the doctrines of [[Jesus]]".&lt;ref name=WritingsOf&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1mIFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=roguery+of+others+of+His+disciples |title=The Writings of Thomas Jefferson: Being His Autobiography, Correspondence |first=Thomas |last=Jefferson |pages=156 |year=1854 |editor=H. A. WASHINGTON|publisher=TAYLOR &amp; MATJRY|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson also denied the divine inspiration of the [[Book of Revelation]], describing it to [[Alexander Smyth]] in 1825 as "merely the ravings of a maniac, no more worthy nor capable of explanation than the incoherences of our own nightly dreams".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1mIFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA395&amp;lpg=PA395&amp;dq=no+more+worthy+nor+capable+of+explanation+than+the+incoherences+of+our+own+nightly+dreams |title=The Writings of Thomas Jefferson: Being His Autobiography, Correspondence|first=Thomas |last=Jefferson|year=1854|editor=H. A. WASHINGTON|publisher=TAYLOR &amp; MATJRY|pages=395|location=WASHINGTON, D. C|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his study of the Bible, Jefferson concluded that Jesus never claimed to be God.&lt;ref name=Larson171&gt;Edward J. Larson, ''A Magnificent Catastrophe: The Tumultuous Election of 1800, America's First Presidential Campaign'' (Simon and Schuster, 2007), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803 Jefferson composed a "Syllabus of an Estimate of the Merit of the Doctrines of Jesus" of the comparative merits of Christianity, after having read the pamphlet "Socrates and Jesus Compared" by the Unitarian minister Dr. [[Joseph Priestley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://americancreation.blogspot.com/2009/09/jeffersons-syllabus-philosophy-and-life.html Jared Farley, ''Jefferson's "Syllabus", "Philosophy" and "Life &amp; Morals"]&lt;/ref&gt; In this brief work Jefferson affirms Jesus' "moral doctrines, relating to kindred &amp; friends, were more pure &amp; perfect than those of the most correct of the philosophers, and greatly more so than those of the Jews," but asserts that "fragments only of what he did deliver have come to us mutilated, misstated, &amp; often unintelligible" and that "the question of his being a member of the Godhead, or in direct communication with it, claimed for him by some of his followers, and denied by others is foreign to the present view, which is merely an estimate of the intrinsic merit of his doctrines."&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/master/mss/mtj/mtj1/028/0100/0195.jpg page 1] &amp; [http://memory.loc.gov/master/mss/mtj/mtj1/028/0100/0196.jpg page 2]&lt;/ref&gt; He let only a few see it, including [[Benjamin Rush]] in 1803 and William Short in 1820. When Rush died in 1813, Jefferson asked the family to return the document to him.

In 1804, Jefferson began piecing together his own version of the [[Gospel]]s from which he omitted the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], [[miracles attributed to Jesus]], [[Divinity of Jesus#Denial of Christ's divine nature|divinity]], and the [[resurrection of Jesus]] – among many other teachings and events.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon-Reed, Annette and Peter S. Onuf.

This compilation was completed about 1820, but Jefferson did not make these works public, acknowledging "The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth" existence only to a few friends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Jeffersons-Bible.html?onsite_source=relatedarticles&amp;onsite_medium=internallink&amp;onsite_campaign=SmithMag&amp;onsite_content=Secretary%20Clough%20on%20Jefferson%27s%20Bible Smithsonian magazine, ''Secretary Clough on Jefferson's Bible'']{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This work was published after his death and became known as the ''[[Jefferson Bible]]''.&lt;ref name=1820Short /&gt;

== Anti-clericalism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-Calvinism ==
While Jefferson did indeed include some Protestant clergymen as amongst his friends,&lt;ref name="clerical friends"&gt;[http://www.jeffersonhour.com/Barton%20Review.html The Thomas Jefferson Hour: Clay Jenkinson book review, June 3, 2012] Excerpt: "Jefferson had many friends who were pastors, ministers, theologians, preachers, and priests".&lt;/ref&gt; and while he did in fact donate monies in support of some churches,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/jeffersons-religious-beliefs Jefferson's Religious Beliefs] Monticello.org Discussion of Jefferson's church donations. Downloaded 15-04-03.&lt;/ref&gt; his attitude towards Protestant clerics as a group and the Roman Catholic Church as a whole was one of extreme aversion.&lt;ref&gt;Luebke, Fred C.  [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/historyfacpub/180/ "The Origins of Thomas Jefferson's Anti-Clericalism."] ''DigitalCommons@University of Nebraska - Lincoln''.  1963.  5 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson's residence in France just before the French Revolution left him deeply suspicious of [[Catholic priest]]s and bishops, considering them a force for reaction and ignorance. His later private letters indicated he was skeptical of too much interference by Catholic clergy in matters of civil government. He wrote in letters: "History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government"&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[Alexander von Humboldt]] regarding religion in Mexico, December 6, 1813&lt;/ref&gt; and "[i]n every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the [[despotism|despot]], abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Horatio G. Spafford, March 17, 1814&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1817 he wrote to John Adams:

{{quote|The Christian priesthood, finding the doctrines of Christ levelled to every understanding and too plain to need explanation, saw, in the mysticisms of Plato, Materials with which they might build up an artificial system which might, from its indistinctness, admit everlasting controversy, give employment for their order, and introduce it to profit, power, and preeminence. The doctrines which flowed from the lips of Jesus himself are within the comprehension of a child; but thousands of volumes have not yet explained the Platonisms engrafted on them: and for this obvious reason that nonsense can never be explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=imUjCfbzgkMC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;dq=%22Christian+priesthood,+finding+the+doctrines+of+Christ+levelled%22

In an 1820 letter to [[William Short (American ambassador)|William Short]], Jefferson wrote, "[T]he serious enemies are the priests of the different religious sects, to whose spells on the human mind its improvement is ominous."&lt;ref name=1820Short/&gt;

Jefferson intensely opposed Calvinism. He never ceased to denounce the "blasphemous absurdity of the [[Calvinism#Five points of Calvinism|five points of Calvin]]," writing three years before his death to John Adams, "His [Calvin's] religion was demonism. If ever man worshiped a false God, he did. The being described in his five points is ... a demon of malignant spirit. It would be more pardonable to believe in no God at all, than to blaspheme him by the atrocious attributes of Calvin."&lt;ref&gt;''Works'', Vol. iv., p.&amp;nbsp;363.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Priestley and Unitarianism ==
Jefferson expressed general agreement with [[Unitarianism]], which, like Deism, rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. Jefferson never joined a Unitarian church, but he did attend Unitarian services while in Philadelphia. His friend Joseph Priestley was the minister. Jefferson corresponded on religious matters with numerous Unitarians, among them [[Jared Sparks]] (Unitarian minister, historian and president of Harvard), Thomas Cooper, Benjamin Waterhouse and John Adams. In an 1822 letter to [[Benjamin Waterhouse]] he wrote, "I rejoice that in this blessed country of free inquiry and belief, which has surrendered its conscience to neither kings or priests, the genuine doctrine of only one God is reviving, and I trust that there is not a young man now living in the United States who will not die a Unitarian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/lit/jeff17.htm |title=1822 Letter to Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse |date=June 26, 1822}} (meaning, at least, that they would not be "a Trinitarian")&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson named the teachings of both [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Conyers Middleton]] (an English clergyman who questioned miracles and revelation, emphasizing Christianity's role as a mainstay of social order) as the basis for his own faith. He became friends with Priestley, who lived in Philadelphia. In a letter to John Adams dated August 22, 1813, Jefferson wrote,

{{quote|You are right in supposing, in one of yours, that I had not read much of Priestley's ''Predestination'', his no-soul system, or his controversy with Horsley. But I have read his [[An History of the Corruptions of Christianity|''Corruptions of Christianity'']], and ''Early Opinions of Jesus'', over and over again; and I rest on them, and on Middleton's writings, especially his ''Letters from Rome'', and ''To Waterland'', as the basis of my own faith. These writings have never been answered, nor can be answered by quoting historical proofs, as they have done. For these facts, therefore, I cling to their learning, so much superior to my own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=807&amp;chapter=88112&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=letter in reply to John Adams |location=Monticello |date=August 22, 1813 |accessdate=2011-02-22}} Note: [[Conyers Middleton]]'s name is often omitted when this quote is cited; thereby leading to the inference that Jefferson is relying solely upon Priestley. Middleton defended Deist [[Matthew Tindal]]'s ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' against attacks by [[Daniel Waterland]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jefferson continued to express his strong objections to the doctrines of the virgin birth, the divinity of Jesus, and the Trinity. In a letter to Adams (April 11, 1823), Jefferson wrote, "And the day will come, when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the Supreme Being as His Father, in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the fable of the generation of [[Minerva]] in the brain of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNIcAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;pg=PA284#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Letter to John Adams |location=Monticello |date=April 1823 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an 1821 letter he wrote:

{{quote|No one sees with greater pleasure than myself the progress of reason in its advances towards rational Christianity. When we shall have done away the incomprehensible jargon of the Trinitarian arithmetic, that three are one, and one is three; when we shall have knocked down the artificial scaffolding, reared to mask from view the simple structure of Jesus; when, in short, we shall have unlearned everything which has been taught since His day, and got back to the pure and simple doctrines He inculcated, we shall then be truly and worthily His disciples; and my opinion is that if nothing had ever been added to what flowed purely from His lips, the whole world would at this day have been Christian. I know that the case you cite, of Dr. Drake, has been a common one. The religion-builders have so distorted and deformed the doctrines of Jesus, so muffled them in mysticisms, fancies and falsehoods, have caricatured them into forms so monstrous and inconceivable, as to shock reasonable thinkers, to revolt them against the whole, and drive them rashly to pronounce its Founder an impostor. Had there never been a commentator, there never would have been an infidel. ... I have little doubt that the whole of our country will soon be rallied to the unity of the Creator, and, I hope, to the pure doctrines of Jesus also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNIcAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Letter to Timothy Pickering, Esq. |location=Monticello |date=February 27, 1821 |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jefferson once wrote to the minister of the First Parish Church (Unitarian) in Portland, Maine, asking for services for him and a small group of friends. The church responded that it did not have clergy to send to the South. In an 1825 letter to Waterhouse, Jefferson wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am anxious to see the doctrine of one god commenced in our state. But the population of my neighborhood is too slender, and is too much divided into other sects to maintain any one preacher well. I must therefore be contented to be an Unitarian by myself, altho I know there are many around me who would become so, if once they could hear the questions fairly stated.&lt;ref name=1825water&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaead/published/uva-sc/viu01679.document |author=Thomas Jefferson |title=letter to Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse|date=January 8, 1825}} The copy of this 1825 Thomas Jefferson letter to Waterhouse (1754–1846) is in an unknown hand.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When followers of [[Richard Price]] and Priestley began debating over the existence of free-will and the soul (Priestley had taken the materialist position),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/priestly.htm |title=Joseph Priestley |year=2008 |encyclopedia=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |first=Elizabeth |last=Kingston |accessdate=2009-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson expressed reservations that Unitarians were finding it important to dispute doctrine with one another. In 1822 he held the Quakers up as an example for them to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/lit/jeff17.htm |title=Letter To Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse |location=Monticello |date=June 26, 1822 |quote=I rejoice that in this blessed country of free inquiry and belief, which has surrendered its creed and conscience to neither kings nor priests, the genuine doctrine of one only God is reviving, and I trust that there is not a young man now living in the United States who will not die an Unitarian.  But much I fear, that when this great truth shall be re-established, its votaries will fall into the fatal error of fabricating formulas of creed and confessions of faith, the engines which so soon destroyed the religion of Jesus.... How much wiser are the Quakers, who, agreeing in the fundamental doctrines of the gospel, schismatize about no mysteries, and, keeping within the pale of common sense, suffer no speculative differences of opinion, any more than of feature, to impair the love of their brethren.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jefferson's time, Unitarianism was generally considered a branch of Christianity. Originally it questioned the [[doctrine of the Trinity]] and the [[pre-existence of Christ]]. During the period 1800–1850, Unitarianism began also to question the existence of [[miracles]], the [[inspiration of Scripture]], and the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]], though not yet the [[resurrection of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Webb, "Miracles in English Unitarian Thought", in Mark S. Micale, Robert L. Dietle, Peter Gay, editors, ''Enlightenment, Passion, Modernity: Historical Essays in European Thought and Culture'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Unitarianism no longer implies belief in a deity; some Unitarians are theists and some are not. Modern Unitarians consider Jefferson both a kindred spirit and an important figure in their history. The ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024956/http://www.famousuus.com/ Famous UUs]'' website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/thomasjefferson.html|publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|title=Thomas Jefferson|accessdate=2008-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515181139/http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/thomasjefferson.html|archive-date=2007-05-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; says:

{{quote|Like many others of his time (he died just one year after the founding of institutional Unitarianism in America), Jefferson was a Unitarian in theology, though not in church membership. He never joined a Unitarian congregation: there were none near his home in Virginia during his lifetime. He regularly attended Joseph Priestley's Pennsylvania church when he was nearby, and said that Priestley's theology was his own, and there is no doubt Priestley should be identified as Unitarian. Jefferson remained a member of the Episcopal congregation near his home, but removed himself from those available to become godparents, because he was not sufficiently in agreement with the Trinitarian theology. His work, the Jefferson Bible, was Unitarian in theology ...}}

'''Roberto Esposito''' is an Italian philosopher, who is important for his work in [[biopolitics]].&lt;ref name=campbell2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Greg and Jon Short (2013). "Community, Immunity, and the Proper: An Introduction to the Political Theory of Roberto Esposito". Angelaki 18(3): 1-12. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0969725X.2013.834661#.UnbD5CRQ3M0''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sartre's Sink''''' is a literary pastiche in the form of a [[do it yourself]] handbook. It contains advice about how to undertake 14 common household tasks each written in the style of a famous author from history.&lt;ref name=Australian/&gt; ''Sartre's Sink'' is the second book by photographer and author [[Mark Crick]]. Excerpts have appeared in ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; and the ''[[Evening Herald]]''.&lt;ref name=Herald/&gt;

The book includes chapters on how to; bleed a radiator by [[Emily Brontë]],&lt;ref name=Australian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mail/&gt; tile a bathroom by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]],&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mail/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; hang wallpaper by [[Hemingway]],&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mail/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; unblock a sink by [[Sartre]],&lt;ref name=Australian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mail/&gt; repair a dripping tap with [[Marguerite Duras]],&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; put up a garden fence with [[Hunter S Thompson]],&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herald/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; paint a panelled door with [[Anaïs Nin]],&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; re-glaze a window with [[Milan Kundera]], board an attic with [[Edgar Allan Poe]],&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; loosen a stuck drawer with [[Samuel Beckett]]&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; and how to paint a room with [[Haruki Murakami]].&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; Other parodied authors include [[Goethe]] and [[Joseph Conrad]].&lt;ref name=Australian/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; Mark Crick says that he found Dostoyevsky the most difficult author to parody.&lt;ref name=Surrey/&gt;

As with his previous work, ''Sartre's Sink'' is illustrated with paintings by the author in the style of a number of famous artists including [[van Gogh]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Picasso]], [[Magritte]] and Turner.&lt;ref name=Australian/&gt;

Carolyn Kellogg of the ''[[LA Times]]'' noted that the book was "only marginally instructive".&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; ''[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]'' felt that the subject matter of ''Sartre's Sink'' was "not as interesting" as that of Crick's earlier book ''[[Kafka's Soup]]''. However, the editor nonetheless believed that the quality of the pastiche was equal to that of the earlier book calling both books "a gem".&lt;ref name=Kolkata/&gt; Roy Williams of ''[[The Australian]]'' called it "a minor masterpiece" naming painting the panelled door and putting up the garden fence as his particular favourites.&lt;ref name=Australian/&gt; Ian Sansom of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it "hands-down droll".&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; [[Nicolas d'Estienne d'Orves]] of ''[[Le Figaro]]'' called it "Irresistible".&lt;ref name=Figaro/&gt; ''Sartre's Sink'' was named ''[[Sunday Times]]'' humour book of the year 2008.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

'''Shaki''' ({{lang-az|Şəki}}; until 1968 '''Nukha''', Azerbaijani: ''{{lang|az|Nuxa}}'') is a city in northwestern [[Azerbaijan]], in the [[Sheki (rayon)|rayon of the same name]].

Shaki is in northern Azerbaijan on the southern part of the [[Greater Caucasus]] mountain range, {{convert|325|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Baku]]. The population is 63,000.

== Etymology ==
According to the Azerbaijani historians, the name of the town goes back to the ethnonym of the [[Sakas]], who reached the territory of modern-day Azerbaijan in the 7th century BC and populated it for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narinqala: Shaki's History|url=http://narinqala.com/?lang=eng|accessdate=6 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709205500/http://narinqala.com/?lang=eng|archivedate=9 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval sources, the name of the town is found in various forms such as Sheke, Sheki, Shaka, Shakki, Shakne, Shaken, Shakkan, Shekin.

== History ==

===Antiquity===
There are traces of large-scale settlements in Shaki dating back to more than 2700 years ago. The Sakas were an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian people]] that wandered from the north side of the [[Black Sea]] through Derbend passage and to the [[South Caucasus]] and from there to [[Asia Minor]] in the 7th century B.C.  They occupied a good deal of the fertile lands in South Caucasus in an area called Sakasena. The city of Shaki was one of the areas occupied by the Sakas. The original settlement dates back to the late [[Bronze Age]].

Shaki was one of the biggest cities of the [[Caucasian Albania|Albanian]] states in the 1st century.  The main temple of the ancient Albanians was located there. The kingdom of Shaki was divided into 11 administrative provinces. Shaki was one of the important political and economic cities before the Arab invasion. But as a result of the invasion, Shaki was annexed to the third emirate. An independent Georgia principality, [[Hereti]], was established in times when the [[Caliphate|Arab caliphate]] was weak.&lt;ref name=aztour&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheki history|url=http://aze.info/sheki_more_details/|publisher=Azerbaijan Tour Agency|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was also ruled by the [[Kingdom of Georgia]], the [[Atabegs of Azerbaijan]] and the [[Khwarazmian Empire]], before the [[History of Azerbaijan#Mongols and Ilkhanid rule|Mongol invasion]].

===Feudal era===
[[File:Sheki dvoretc rospisi az.jpg|left|thumb|Battle scene miniature on the wall of [[Palace of Shaki Khans|Khan's Palace of Shaki]]]]
After the collapse of the [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu Khan's rule]] in the first half of the 14th century, Shaki gained independence under the rule of Sidi Ahmed Orlat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yjIZ6ymyNO8C&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22orlat+dynasty%22&amp;ei=WlyMS5DDEaSclQT5m6SpDQ&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Shaki"], in Historical Dictionary of Azerbaijan 1999, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1500s, [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] king [[Ismail I]] (r. 1501—1524) conquered the area, but the town continued to be governed by its hereditary rulers, under Safavid suzerainty.&lt;ref name="Mage Publishers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nasiri|first1=Ali Naqi|last2=Floor|first2=Willem M.|title=Titles and Emoluments in Safavid Iran: A Third Manual of Safavid Administration|date=2008|publisher=Mage Publishers|isbn=978-1933823232|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ismail's son and successor [[Shah Tahmasp]] (r. 1524—1576) put an end to this, and in 1551, he appointed the first [[Qizilbash]] governor to rule the town.&lt;ref name="Mage Publishers"/&gt; Safavid rule was twice briefly interrupted by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] between 1578 and 1603 and 1724–1735. [[Shaki Khanate]] was established in 1743, during the reign of [[Nader Shah]], and was one of the strongest feudal states among the Caucasian khanates. During existence of Shaki khanate, the local population of the city was engaged in [[silkworm|silkworm breeding]], craft and trade.&lt;ref name=aztour /&gt; As a result of a flood in the river Kish, the city of Shaki was partially ruined and the population was resettled in the present day city.&lt;ref name=sharif /&gt;

===Modern era===
The area was fully annexed by Russia by the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] in 1813 and the khanate was abolished in 1819 and the Shaki province was established in its place. Shaki province was merged with provinces of Shemakha, Baku, Susha, Lankaran, Derbent and Kuban in 1840 and Caspian Oblast was created. At same time Shaki was renamed as Nuha. The oblast was dissolved in 1846 and it was raion center of [[Shemakha Governorate]]. After the earthquake in Shemakha in 1859, the governorate was renamed as [[Baku Governorate]]. On 19 February 1868, raion of Nuha was passed to newly created [[Yelizavetpol Governorate]] with one of Susha. After founding of USSR, it was center of Nuha raion. Its one was abolished on 4 January 1963 and was bounded to one of [[Oghuz (city)|Vartashen]]. Nuha one was founded again in 1965 and finally city and raion regained traditional name in 1968.

During its history, the town saw devastation many times and because of that, the oldest historic and architectural monuments currently preserved are dated to only the 16th–19th centuries. For many centuries, Shaki has been famous for being the center of silkworm-breeding. Originally located on the left bank of the river Kish, the town sat lower down the hill, however Shaki was moved to its present location after a devastating flood in 1772 and became the capital of [[Shaki Khanate]]. As the new location was near the village of Nukha, the city also became known as Nukha, until 1968 when it reverted to the name Shaki.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sheki-ih.gov.az/news.php?cat.21 Şəki Şəhərinin Tarixi] {{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic era===

A letter from the Chairman of the [[Kyoto]] City Council, [[Daisaku Kadokawa]], on 8 December 2008, said that Sheki was a member of the World Historical Cities League. Sheki became a member after the meeting of the Board of the World Cities League in October 2008.

Works to be done in the field of renovation and construction in 2012 were identified: Together with Sheki City Executive Authority and Architectural Urbanization Committee, Shaki City General Plan was prepared. According to the General Plan, it was planned to implement a number of infrastructure projects, as well as the expansion of the city to the west, inclusion of city of [[Oxud]], [[İncə, Shaki]], [[Kiş, Shaki|Kish]], and [[Qoxmuq]] villages to Shaki.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121127154008/www.arxkom.gov.az/imagemanager/images/genplan/boy/seki.jpg ] General Plan of Shaki City&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:032palaceseki.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palace of Shaki Khans]] – seat of [[Shaki Khanate|Shaki khans]].]]

Architecture in Shaki has largely been shaped by Shaki's history. It goes back to a time, when it was a market centre on the [[Silk Road]], linking [[Dagestan]], Russia to the northern trade routes through the Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CNN stops at Shaki City on the Silk Road|url=http://teas.eu/news-cnn-stops-shaki-city-silk-road|website=teas.eu|accessdate=13 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113084329/http://teas.eu/news-cnn-stops-shaki-city-silk-road|archive-date=13 November 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palace of Shaki Khans]] which was a summer residence of [[Shaki Khanate|Shaki Khans]], still remains one of the most visible landmarks of Shaki. Constructed in 1762 without a single [[Nail (fastener)|nail]] is one of the most marvelous monuments of its epoch.&lt;ref name=aze24 /&gt; Displayed within the palace are Azerbaijani Khanate-era artifacts, as well as displays of the art scene, considered to be among the finest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GENERAL INFORMATION ON AZERBAIJANI CULTURE|url=http://www.azerembassy-kuwait.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=23|publisher=Embassy of Azerbaijan in Kuwait|accessdate=6 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725025410/http://www.azerembassy-kuwait.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=23|archive-date=25 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gink|first=Kalory|title=Azerbaijan: Mosques, Turrets, Palaces. |year=1979|publisher=Corvina-Kiado|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Land That Time Forgot''''' is a 1975 British-American [[fantasy film|fantasy]]/[[adventure film]] based upon the 1924 novel ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (novel)|The Land That Time Forgot]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]. The screenplay was written by [[Michael Moorcock]] and [[James Cawthorn (artist)|James Cawthorn]] and directed by [[Kevin Connor (director)|Kevin Connor]]. The cast included [[Doug McClure]], [[John McEnery]], [[Keith Barron]], [[Susan Penhaligon]], [[Anthony Ainley]] and [[Declan Mulholland]].

==Plot==
The movie begins with a bottle with a written manuscript inside it being thrown into the sea, hoping for it to be discovered later.
Floating to coast of England, a sailor discovers the bottle and opens to read the manuscript as Bowen Tyler ([[Doug McClure]]) narrates the events, much as we see in many Edgar Rice Burroughs novels. 
 
The story is set during [[World War I]] and involves the survivors of the sinking of a British merchant ship who are taken on board a German [[U-boat]].

Bowen Tyler and Lisa Clayton ([[Susan Penhaligon]]) are passengers on the ship torpedoed by Captain von Schoenvorts ([[John McEnery]]). Along with a few surviving British officers, Tyler convinces the other men to take over the surfacing submarine, this being their only chance for survival. After confronting the Germans on the deck, a fight ensues and they seize the German U-boat. Tyler takes command hoping to sail to a British port. Von Schoenvorts has his crew steer toward a safe sea port. But German officer Dietz ([[Anthony Ainley]]) gets loose and smashes the sub's radio.

Off course and running out of fuel in the South Atlantic, the U-boat and its crew happen across an uncharted sub-continent called [[Caprona (island)|Caprona]], a fantastical land of lush vegetation where [[dinosaur]]s still roam, co-existing with primitive man. There are also reserves of oil which, if the Germans and British can work together, can be refined and enable their escape from the island.

Tyler discovers the secret of Caprona: individuals evolve not through [[natural selection]], but by migrating northward across the island. With the submarine working again but a sudden outbreak of volcanic eruptions across the island, Dietz starts a mutiny and shoots Captain von Schoenvorts to take command. Dietz abandons Tyler and Clayton in Caprona in an attempt to escape, but the U-Boat cannot function in the boiling waters and the crew is killed as it sinks. Tyler and Clayton are stranded and being the only survivors of their group, they are forced to move northwards. The movie ends with Tyler throwing the bottle, with the manuscript inside it, as seen in the beginning of the movie.

==Production==
Amicus originally wanted to cast Doug McClure in the lead but he refused so they signed [[Stuart Whitman]]. Then [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] of [[American International Pictures]] came on board as co-financers, providing the bulk of the budget, but would only make the film if McClure was cast. He changed his mind and agreed to do the film.&lt;ref name="AIP"&gt;Mark McGee, ''Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures'', McFarland, 1996 p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Connor said "Doug was a great asset. In fight scenes he was especially good due to his hours of American TV action films. He knew exactly where the camera was at all times and threw punches precisely where the effect would work for the screen.  He was always co-operative and came up with many ideas."&lt;ref name="kevin"/&gt;

Shooting began February 1974 and went for 16 weeks.

Kevin Connor recalled, "The reason we went for the hand puppets was for a more fluid look. Roger Dicken, who created the dinosaurs did such fine details and had the movement down so well that we went with him and used that technique. Also, we developed the use of a small VistaVision camera to shoot the dinosaur back-ground plates which gave us great quality because the exposed frame is twice the size of a normal 35mm.  Everything was shot front projection as well."&lt;ref name="kevin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heyuguys.com/the-studio-that-time-forgot-an-interview-with-amicus-director-kevin-connor/|title=The Studio That Time Forgot – An Interview With Amicus Director Kevin Connor|first=Ross|last= Jones-Morris|date=7 August 2012|website=Hey Guys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U-boat and ships were models and the dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals were puppets, hand-held or on strings rather than [[stop motion]]. The speaking part of Von Schoenvorts was later dubbed in post-production by German-born actor [[Anton Diffring]].

Amicus was to make two more Burroughs adaptations, ''[[The People That Time Forgot (film)|The People That Time Forgot]]'' (1977), a direct sequel to this film starring [[Patrick Wayne]], [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]] and McClure in an appearance midway to towards the end and ''[[At the Earth's Core (film)|At the Earth's Core]]'' (1976), with McClure (in a different role), [[Peter Cushing]], and [[Caroline Munro]]. All three films were distributed in the United States by [[American International Pictures]]

==Reception==
''The Land That Time Forgot'' was met with mixed reviews from critics and audiences, earning a [[Rotten Tomatoes]] approval rating of 50%.

The New York Times noted the film is "an initially agreeable picture about the discovery of a mystery realm where various stages of evolution coexist," but "the early virtues of "Land" collapse once the island is reached and the traffic jam in artificial monsters develops."&lt;ref name="AIP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anon (August 14, 1975).

The film was the 14th biggest hit at the British box office in 1975.&lt;ref name="amicus"/&gt;  

On April 14, 2017, the film was featured in the eleventh season of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

[[File:Arabella Fermor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.08|Arabella Fermor, a 19th-century print after Sir Peter Lely's portrait of her]]

'''''The Rape of the Lock''''' is a [[mock-heroic]] [[narrative poem]] written by [[Alexander Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pope/alexander/rape/contents.html Text online] from Adelaide University&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most commonly cited examples of [[high burlesque]], it was first published anonymously in Lintot's ''Miscellaneous Poems and Translations'' (May 1712) in two [[canto]]s (334 lines); a revised edition "Written by Mr. Pope" followed in March 1714 as a five-canto version (794 lines) accompanied by six engravings. Pope boasted that this sold more than three thousand copies in its first four days.&lt;ref&gt;Sherburn, G., Eed. ''Correspondence of Alexander Pope'', Oxford University Press, 1956, I, 201.&lt;/ref&gt; The final form of the poem appeared in 1717 with the addition of Clarissa's speech on good humour. The poem was much translated and contributed to the growing popularity of mock-heroic in Europe. 

==Description==
The poem [[satire|satirises]] a small incident by comparing it to the [[Epic poetry|epic]] world of the gods. It was based on an actual event recounted to the poet by Pope's friend, [[John Caryll the younger|John Caryll]]. [[Arabella Fermor]] and her suitor, [[Robert Petre, 7th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]], were both from aristocratic [[recusancy|recusant]] Catholic families, at a time in England when, under such laws as the [[Test Act]], all denominations except [[Anglicanism]] suffered legal restrictions and penalties. (For example, Petre, being a Catholic, could not take the place in the [[House of Lords]] that would otherwise have been rightfully his.) Petre had cut off a [[lock of hair|lock of Arabella's hair]] without permission, and the consequent argument had created a breach between the two families. The poem's title does not refer to the extreme of [[rape|sexual rape]], but to an earlier alternative definition of the word derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] [[wikt:Special:Search/rapere|''rapere'']] (supine stem ''raptum''), "to snatch, to grab, to carry off"&lt;ref name = "cor"&gt;Corinne J. Saunders, ''Rape and Ravishment in the Literature of Medieval England'', Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2001, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kei"&gt;Keith Burgess-Jackson, ''A Most Detestable Crime: New Philosophical Essays on Rape'', Oxford University Press, New York, 1999, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; —in this case, the theft and carrying away of a lock of hair. In terms of the sensibilities of the age, however, even this non-consensual personal invasion might be interpreted as bringing dishonour.

Pope, also a Catholic, wrote the poem at the request of friends in an attempt to "comically merge the two" worlds, the heroic with the social. He utilised the character Belinda to represent Arabella and introduced an entire system of "[[sylph]]s", or guardian spirits of virgins, a parodised version of the gods and goddesses of conventional epic. Pope derived his sylphs from the 17th-century French Rosicrucian novel ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]''.&lt;ref name="Seeber"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seeber |first=Edward D. |year=1944|title=Sylphs and Other Elemental Beings in French Literature since Le Comte de Gabalis (1670)|journal=[[Publications of the Modern Language Association|PMLA]]|volume=59|issue=1|pages=71–83|jstor=458845}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope, writing pseudonymously as Esdras Barnivelt, also published ''A Key to the Lock'' in 1714 as a humorous warning against taking the poem too seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004809274.0001.000?view=toc|title=''A key to the lock: Or, a treatise proving, beyond all contradiction, the dangerous tendency of a late poem, entituled, The rape of the lock, to government and religion''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RapeLock9New Star.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|"The New Star", illustration by [[Aubrey Beardsley]] for ''The Rape of the Lock'']]

Pope's poem uses the traditional high stature of classical epics to emphasise the triviality of the incident. The abduction of [[Helen of Troy]] becomes here the theft of a lock of hair; the gods become minute sylphs; the description of [[Achilles]]' shield becomes an [[excursus]] on one of Belinda's petticoats. He also uses the epic style of invocations, lamentations, exclamations and similes, and in some cases adds [[parody]] to imitation by following the framework of actual speeches in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]''. Although the poem is humorous at times, Pope keeps a sense that beauty is fragile, and emphasizes that the loss of a lock of hair touches Belinda deeply.

The humour of the poem comes from the [[storm in a teacup]] being couched within the elaborate, formal verbal structure of an epic poem. It is a satire on contemporary society which showcases the lifestyle led by some people of that age. Pope arguably satirises it from within rather than looking down judgmentally on the characters. Belinda's legitimate rage is thus alleviated and tempered by her good humour, as directed by the character Clarissa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.risenotes.com/rape/Rape-of-the-Lock.php|title=RiseNotes-Rape of the Lock|first=Muhammad|last=Ijaz|website=www.risenotes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dedicatory letter==
Pope added to the second edition the following dedicatory letter to Mrs. Arabella Fermor:

{{quote|

Madam,

It will be in vain to deny that I have some regard for this piece, since I dedicate it to You. Yet you may bear me witness, it was intended only to divert a few young Ladies, who have good sense and good humour enough to laugh not only at their sex's little unguarded follies, but at their own. But as it was communicated with the air of a secret, it soon found its way into the world. An imperfect copy having been offered to a Bookseller, you had the good nature for my sake to consent to the publication of one more correct: This I was forced to, before I had executed half my design, for the Machinery was entirely wanting to complete it.

The Machinery, Madam, is a term invented by the Critics, to signify that part which the [[deity|Deities]], [[Angel]]s, or [[Daemon (classical mythology)|Dæmons]] are made to act in a poem: For the ancient poets are in one respect like many modern ladies: let an action be never so trivial in itself, they always make it appear of the utmost importance. These Machines I determined to raise on a very new and odd foundation, the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] doctrine of [[Spirit]]s.

I know how disagreeable it is to make use of hard words before a lady; but 'tis so much the concern of a poet to have his works understood and particularly by your sex, that you must give me leave to explain two or three difficult terms.

The Rosicrucians are the people I must bring you acquainted with. The best account I know of them is in a French book called [[Comte de Gabalis|Le Comte de Gabalis]], which both in its title and size is so like a novel, that many of the fair sex have read it for one by mistake. According to these gentlemen, the four [[classical element|elements]] are inhabited by [[spirit]]s, which they call [[Sylph]]s, [[Gnome]]s, [[ondine (mythology)|Nymphs]], and [[salamander (legendary creature)|Salamanders]]. The Gnomes or Dæmons of Earth delight in [[mischief]]; but the Sylphs, whose habitation is in the air, are the best-conditioned creatures imaginable. For they say, any mortals may enjoy the most intimate familiarities with these gentle spirits, upon a condition very easy to all true [[adept]]s, an inviolate preservation of [[Chastity]].

As to the following [[Canto]]s, all the passages of them are as fabulous as the Vision at the beginning or the Transformation at the end; (except the loss of your Hair, which I always mention with reverence). The human persons are as fictitious as the airy ones, and the character of Belinda, as it is now managed, resembles you in nothing but in Beauty.}}

==Summary==
[[File:Lockenraub Werner.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|Belinda sails down the Thames to Hampton Court attended by sylphs; a copperplate engraving by Anna Maria Werner (1744)]]
In the beginning of this mock-epic, Pope declares that a "dire offence" (Canto 1 line 1) has been committed. A lord has assaulted a "gentle belle" (line 8), causing her to reject him. He then proceeds to tell the story of this offence.

While Belinda is still asleep, her guardian [[Sylph]] Ariel forewarns her that "some dread event impends". Belinda then awakes and gets ready for the day with the help of her maid, Betty. The Sylphs, though unseen, also contribute: "These set the head, and those divide the hair, some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown" (146–147). Here Pope also describes Belinda's two locks of hair "which graceful hung behind". The Baron, one of Belinda's suitors, greatly admires these locks and conspires to steal one. Building an altar, he places on it "all the trophies of his former loves" (line 40), sets them on fire and fervently prays "soon to obtain, and long possess" (line 44) the lock.

Ariel, disturbed by the impending event although not knowing what it will be, summons many sylphs to her and instructs them to guard Belinda from anything that may befall her, whether she "forget her prayers, or miss a masquerade, Or lost her heart, or necklace, at a ball" (line 108–109). So protected, Belinda arrives at Hampton Court and is invited to play a game of [[ombre]].

The conspiring Baron acquires a pair of scissors and tries to snip off one of her locks but is prevented by the watchful Sylphs. This happens three times, but in the end the Baron succeeds (also cutting a Sylph in two although Pope reassures us, parodying a passage in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', that "airy substance soon unites again" [line 152]). When Belinda discovers her lock is gone, she falls into a tantrum,  while the Baron celebrates his victory.

A gnome named Umbriel now journeys to the Cave of Spleen and from the Queen receives a bag of "sighs, sobs, and passions, and the war of tongues" (canto 4 line 84) and a vial filled "with fainting fears, soft sorrows, melting griefs, and flowing tears" (line 85–86) and brings them to Belinda. Finding her dejected in the arms of the woman Thalestris, Umbriel pours the contents over them both.

Many people, moved by Belinda's grief, demand the lock back, but the Baron is unrepentant and refuses. Clarissa admonishes them to keep their good humour, but they will not listen and instead a battle ensues with glares, songs and wits as weapons. Belinda fights with the Baron and throws snuff up his nose to subdue him. When she demands that he restore the lock, however, it is nowhere to be found. It has been made a constellation and is destined to outlast the contestants.

==Translations==

Translations of the poem into French, Italian and German were all made in the first half of the 18th century. Others in those languages followed later, as well as in Dutch, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, Polish, Swedish and Danish.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Rogers, ''The Alexander Pope Encyclopedia'', Greenwood Press 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=udRlsDhfhoUC&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;ots=R8VxAZY5Kv&amp;dq=%22Eloisa%20to%20Abelard%22%20%20translations%20into%20Italian&amp;pg=PA104#v=snippet&amp;q=Rape%20of%20the%20Lock%20&amp;f=false p.242]&lt;/ref&gt; The work had originally come to European notice through an anonymous prose version, ''La Boucle de Cheveux Enlevée'', published anonymously in 1728&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ocFgAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=La Boucle de Cheveux enlevée; poëme héroï-comique de Monsieur Pope.

Despite there being a playful French model for this kind of writing in [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]'s ''Lutrin'', the translator claims of Pope's work in the preface that "I do not believe that there can be found in our language anything more ingenious, in this playful genre."&lt;ref&gt;''Alexander Pope: The Critical Heritage'', Routledge 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-8Ol9gODas0C&amp;lpg=PT107&amp;ots=tGZdJFYdSD&amp;dq=rape%20of%20the%20lock%20%20%22Abb%C3%A9%20Desfontaines%20%22&amp;pg=PT107#v=onepage&amp;q=rape%20of%20the%20lock%20%20%22Abb%C3%A9%20Desfontaines%20%22&amp;f=false, ch.23]&lt;/ref&gt; A verse translation by [[Jean-François Marmontel]] followed in 1746.&lt;ref&gt;Available in Google Books,[https://books.google.com/books?id=oPlWAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=rape+of+the+lock++%22Abb%C3%A9+Desfontaines+%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s p.93ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lockenraub Gottsched.jpg|thumb|''Der Lockenraub'', the 1744 German translation of Pope's poem by Luise Gottsched]]

The first German translation, ''Der merckwürdige Haar-Locken-Raub'' (1739), was a rendering of the French prose version of 1728. [[Luise Gottsched ]]'s verse translation, ''Der Lockenraub'', was begun in the 1730s, again using a French prose version. However, she revised it totally once she managed to obtain the original text in English and in this way pioneered an interest in English literature in the German-language area. From then on, "Pope became very popular as a model for German poets from the 1750s onwards and remained an important source of inspiration throughout the second half of the 18th century," and in particular as a model for mock heroic poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4-eOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=the+rape+of+the+lock+%22translation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BjXJTpHpbX&amp;sig=9icJlt6Nk24gv9CdJfR9uq2hUek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz1Kn6oLTOAhWiIMAKHZm_C8w4ChDoAQgiMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20rape%20of%20the%20lock%20%22translation%22&amp;f=false introduction to the MHRA reprint], London 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Early Italian verse translations of the poem include Andrea Bonducci's ''Il Riccio Rapito'' (Florence 1739), followed by [[Antonio Schinella Conti]]'s version, begun much earlier and finally published in Venice in 1751.&lt;ref&gt;''Giuseppe Parinis Il Giorno im Kontext der europäischen Aufklärung'', Würzburg 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iKdAiyHQ5XcC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=the+rape+of+the+lock++%22Antonio+Conti%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=26bYE0s8JV&amp;sig=Oa58rNyvyLUsnyZMXjtBvY48Nj4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9iLDVqrTOAhUEDMAKHRauBuAQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20rape%20of%20the%20lock%20%20%22Antonio%20Conti%22&amp;f=false p.236]&lt;/ref&gt; The vogue for Pope's work went on to blossom at the start of the 19th century with separate translations by Federico Federici (Faziola 1819),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8oaYAAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Il+Riccio+Rapito+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWzKmw5rTOAhVeF8AKHURqCVgQ6AEIWjAI|title=Il Riccio rapito, di Alessandro Pope, traduzione di Federico Federici, ...|first=Alexander|last=Pope|date=24 August 2018|publisher=Stamp.

Scandinavian versions appeared near the start of the 19th century, beginning with the Swedish ''Våldet på Belindas låck'' (Stockholm, 1797) by Johan Lorens Odhelius (1737-1816). It was followed in 1819 by ''Den bortröfvade hårlocken'' by Jonas Magnus Stjernstolpe (1777-1831), and by the Danish imitation ''Belinde, eller den røvede Haarlok'' by Anton Martini (1773-1847) in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblioteksvagten.dk/single_question.asp?quid=150024:12582f09-ec2d-41d4-bdf6-ef4618d51883|title=Dansk oversættelse af Alexander Popes "The rape of the Lock"|website=biblioteksvagten.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parody and interpretation==
In 1717 [[Giles Jacob]] published his bawdy parody, ''The Rape of the Smock'', the plot of which turns on voyeurism and enforced seduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=waxkAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;ots=VOyCwjhWuN&amp;dq=Giles+Jacob,+The+Rape+of+the+Smock&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q=Giles+Jacob,+The+Rape+of+the+Smock&amp;f=false|title=The Rape of the Smock. An Heroi-comic Poem. In Two Cantos. [By Giles Jacob.]|date=24 August 1768|publisher=J. Brown|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; building on erotic undertones present in Pope's poem which were to be taken up by its illustrators, and reached an apotheosis in [[Aubrey Beardsley]]'s work.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Benedict, ''Curiosity: A Cultural History of Early Modern Inquiry'', University of Chicago 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JY5WgEAZ-6kC&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;ots=2zh1ECAeIh&amp;dq=Rape%20of%20the%20Lock%20%20%22Fuseli%22&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=Rape%20of%20the%20Lock%20%20%22Fuseli%22&amp;f=false pp.79-81]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1714 edition of ''The Rape of the Lock'' and those that followed from Lintot's press had come with six woodcuts designed by [[Louis Du Guernier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rape_of_the_Lock|title=The Rape of the Lock|first=Alexander|last=Pope|publisher=|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the work of this artist has been described as unimaginative,&lt;ref&gt;Morris R. Brownell, ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'' 16.1, 1982, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2738006?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents p.91]&lt;/ref&gt; he goes beyond his literal brief in making Belinda sleep in unwarranted [[décolletage]] in the first canto, while in the second giving the "painted vessel" on its way down the Thames the tilted perspective of the [[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]]. Furthermore, Du Guernier's frontispiece owes its iconography to a print by [[Etienne Baudet]] after a painting by [[Francesco Albani]] of ''Venus at her Toilette'', making for an identification of Belinda with the goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Erwin, ''Textual Vision: Augustan Design and the Invention of Eighteenth-Century British Culture'', Bucknell University 2015, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_i4ABwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=textual+vision&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuhsiA6I_YAhUG32MKHXlqCH4Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=textual%20vision&amp;f=false pp.17-58]&lt;/ref&gt;

The German translation of the poem published from [[Leipzig]] in 1744 had five copperplate engravings by Anna Maria Werner (1689–1753), the court painter of [[Saxony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonbeattie.kattare.com/blog/archives/2033|title=A new audience for Pope - Simon Beattie|website=www.simonbeattie.kattare.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed, however, that the places they depict are not specifically English and that the scene of the game of ombre in Canto 3 is "clearly based on a Leipzig coffee-house", complete with lapdogs tumbling on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Brown's introduction to ''Luise Gottsched, Der Lockenraub'', MHRA 2014, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4-eOBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;ots=BjXKMsMp8W&amp;dq=Anna%20Maria%20Werner%20%20%22Lockenraub%22&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=Anna%20Maria%20Werner%20%20%22Lockenraub%22&amp;f=false p.12]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Sir Plume Demands Leslie.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Sir Plume demands the restoration of the lock'', an oil painting by Charles Robert Leslie, 1854]]

Meanwhile, in Britain most illustrations of the work were descending into "high kitsch and low camp".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Halsband, ''The Rape of the Lock and its Illustrations'', OUP 1980, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; The 1798 edition, for example, illustrated by a variety of contemporary artists, is particularly noted now for [[Thomas Stothard]]'s watercolour in which fairies are pictured with wings. Advised by [[William Blake]] to make the sylphs like butterflies, Stothard decided to "paint the wing from the butterfly itself" and immediately went out to catch one.&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Elizabeth Lewis, ''Air's Appearance: Literary Atmosphere in British Fiction, 1660-1794'', University of Chicago 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uZrrhSFgh28C&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;ots=uB2BgyVXzj&amp;dq=rape%20of%20the%20lock%20anthony%20walker&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q=rape%20of%20the%20lock%20anthony%20walker&amp;f=false p.88]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil paintings by two artists rise a little above this judgment. [[Henry Fuseli]]'s erotic ''The Dream of Belinda'' (1789–1790) goes beyond the actual episode to incorporate other imagery from the poem and some details peculiar only to Fuseli, such as the white moths in copulation in the lower foreground.&lt;ref&gt;Vancouver Art Gallery, [http://projects.vanartgallery.bc.ca/publications/75years/pdf/Fuseli_Henry_16.pdf p.4]&lt;/ref&gt; He also illustrated the Cave of Spleen episode from Canto 4, but this met with contemporary scepticism&lt;ref&gt;Luisa Cale, ''Fuseli's Milton Gallery'', Oxford 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aUwVDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;ots=uNYuzU2PTL&amp;dq=fuseli%20%20cave%20of%20spleen&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=fuseli%20%20cave%20of%20spleen&amp;f=false p.56]&lt;/ref&gt; and the original is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1650848&amp;partId=1&amp;people=124383&amp;peoA=124383-2-23&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; Only [[Thomas Holloway (painter)|Thomas Holloway]]'s print remains to suggest that critics might have been right in seeing in it more "burlesque than sublimity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1650848&amp;partId=1&amp;people=124383&amp;peoA=124383-2-23&amp;page=1|title=The Cave of Spleen, with Umbriel Receiving from the Goddess the Bag and Vial|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following century, [[Charles Robert Leslie]]'s 1854 period piece, ''Sir Plume Demands the Restoration of the Lock'', takes place in a cluttered drawing room in which the kind of lap dog present in many previous pictures feeds from a dish on the floor.

The nine photo-engravings with which Aubrey Beardsley "embroidered" the 1896 edition of the poem &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pope/alexander/rape|title=The Rape of the Lock|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew on the French [[rococo]] style, in which there was a contemporary revival of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.reading.ac.uk/special-collections/2013/07/favourite-find-aubrey-beardsleys-illustrations-for-the-rape-of-the-lock|title=Favourite Find: Aubrey Beardsley’s illustrations for ‘The Rape of the Lock’|date=19 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well received at the time, their enduring popularity is deserved for the way they reinterpret the poem in ways only a very few had managed earlier.

==Influence==
Pope's fanciful conclusion to his work, translating the stolen lock into the sky, where "'midst the stars [it] inscribes Belinda's name", contributed to the eventual naming of three of the [[moons of Uranus]] after characters from ''The Rape of the Lock'': [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]], [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], and [[Belinda (moon)|Belinda]]. The first two are major bodies and were named in 1852 by [[John Herschel]], a year after their discovery. The inner satellite Belinda was not discovered until 1986 and is the only other of the planet's 27 moons taken from Pope's poem rather than Shakespeare's works.

Modern adaptations of ''The Rape of the Lock'' include Deborah Mason's opera-ballet, on which the composer worked since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debmasonstudio.com/Rape_of_the_Lock_Opera_by_Deborah_Mason.html|title=the rape of the lock opera |website=debmasonstudio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had its premiere as an opera-oratorio in June 2016, performed by the Spectrum Symphony of New York and the [[New York Baroque Dance Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://roulette.org/event/alexander-popes-rape-lock-opera-oratorio-deborah-mason-2 Roulette]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A performance of the last act is available on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9c5YH3HGo YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; There had also been a 2006 performance at [[Sheffield University]]'s Drama Studio of a musical work based on Pope's poem composed by Jenny Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/683-1.175047 Sheffield University]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Topkapı Scroll''' ({{lang-tr|Topkapı Parşömeni}}) is a [[Timurid dynasty]] pattern [[scroll]] in the collection of the [[Topkapı Palace]] museum.

The scroll is a valuable source of information, consisting of 114 patterns that may have been used both indirectly and directly by architects to create the tiling patterns in many mosques around the world, including the [[quasicrystal]] [[Girih tilings]] from [[Darb-e Imam]].

==Physical properties==
The Topkapı scroll is a {{convert|33|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide scroll of {{convert|29.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, which is unrolled side to side.&lt;ref name="cromwell"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cromwell, P.R. |journal=Mathematical Intelligencer |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=36–56 |year=2009 |title=The Search for Quasi-Periodicity in Islamic 5-fold Ornament |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/760261153n347478/?p=405b9dbf45ea4f4793a097b6e12dcb08pi=7 |doi=10.1007/s00283-008-9018-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One end of the scroll is fixed to a wooden roller, and the other end is glued to a protective leather piece.&lt;ref name="necipoglu1"&gt;{{cite book | title= Geometric Design in timurid/Turkmen Architectural Practice: Thoughts on a Recently Discovered Scroll and Its Late Gothic Parallels |author=Gülru Necipoğlu |work=Timurid Art and Culture - Iran and Central Asia in the Fifteenth Century (eds (Golombek, L. and Subtelny, M.) |publisher=E.J. Brill |year=1992 |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic570061.files/articles/Geometric_Design.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[parchment]] pieces featuring various patterns are applied on the scroll. The differences in the border of some drawings indicate that the Topkapı Scroll consists of two different scrolls fixed together. The fact that it is not worn out suggests that it was not made to be used as a reference document in a craftman's workshop, but rather than as an exhibition work in the palace. It was probably a record of tiling works carried out in the palace.&lt;ref name="rogers"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Notes on a recent study of the Topkapı scroll: a review article |author=Rogers, J.M. |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=433–439 |year=1997 |jstor=619536 |doi=10.1017/s0041977x0003247x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scroll was made by one person only. Most of the patterns were drawn on two pieces of parchment that were put together, and then pasted on the scroll. The placement of the patterns on the scroll is somewhat disorganized. Patterns of similar [[theme (arts)|theme]]s are fallen apart, and some patterns formed on two parchment pieces are combined imperfectly.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt;

The stamp on the scroll "H1956" indicates that it is registered in the inventory of the Topkapı Palace's Treasury department.

An edition of the scroll was published with an extensive commentary, but it is now out of print.

==History==
The Topkapı Scroll was presumably prepared in Iran during the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the end of the 15th century or beginning of the 16th century. A similarity between some of the patterns on the Topkapı Scroll and a tile panel in the [[Jame-e Kabir Mosque]] (grand mosque) in [[Yazd]] indicates that this scroll was created in [[Tabriz]]. On the other hand, it is possible that the scroll was made in [[Shiraz]] because it consists of mainly [[muqarnas]] in the form of a hand-held fan referred by [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]] as Shirazi. It may have been looted 
by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s after the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–90)]].

The muqarnas on the scroll, which are mostly in the form of a hand-held fan, reflect the architectural style of the Timurid dynasty, [[Turkmen people#Turkmen in Iran and Afghanistan|Turkmen people in Iran and Central Asia]]. In contrast, the muqarnas in [[Cairo]] are in the form of [[seashell]].

The Topkapı Scroll was discovered in 1986. [[Gülru Necipoğlu]] of [[Harvard University]] published a book, which describes the scroll with copies of its patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Gülru Necipoglu: The Topkapı Scroll: geometry and ornament in Islamic architecture.

[[File:Topkapi Scroll P290.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Quarter dome muqarnas - in the form of a seashell (top), in the form of a radial, hand-held fan (bottom)]]

The scroll consists of 114 geometric patterns drawn in ink and dye. It displays decorative ornaments found on the walls and domes of structures built between the  10th and 16th century in the Timurid dynasty. It was a guidebook for architectural designs seen in complex [[muqarnas]], [[girih]], mosaic panels and colorful tiles. The scroll does not mention how those patterns are constructed, and has no date or signature.&lt;ref name="necipoglu1"/&gt;

The two-dimensional figures make it unclear how they can be employed to three-dimensional ornamental objects.&lt;ref&gt;Artisans and Mathematicians in Medieval Islam. The Topkapi Scroll: Geometry and Ornament in Islamic Architecture by Gülru Necipoğlu Review by: George Saliba (1999). Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 119, No. 4, pp. 637-645 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/604839]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=van den Hoeven, Saskia, van der Veen, Maartje |title=Muqarnas-Mathematics in Islamic Arts |url=http://www.wiskuu.nl/muqarnas/Muqarnas_english8.pdf |accessdate=2011-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927070005/http://www.wiskuu.nl/muqarnas/Muqarnas_english8.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the characteristics of the Topkapı Scroll is that it includes [[Islamic calligraphy|Arabic calligraphy]] called [[Kufic#Square or geometric Kufic|square or geometric Kufic]]. This script type was seen for the first time in the state of [[Ilkhanate]], and it was presumably created in inspiration from [[Chinese character]]s in rectangular form.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt; One of the patterns on the Topkapı Scroll, which matches an existing architectural structure, is the Kufic script drawn for [[banna'i]], in which tiles are alternated with plain bricks to create geometric patterns over the surface of a wall.  Almost exactly the same of this pattern is found on the gate of a mosque in [[Varzaneh]].&lt;ref name="necipoglu1"/&gt;

[[File:Topkapi Scroll P325.JPG|thumb|250px|Hexagon with Kufic scripts of six time [[Muhammad]] (Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh) and three time [[Ali]] (Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib) in rotational symmetry]]
Some of the patterns show the application of geometric principles to Islamic traditions. For example, the word [[Muhammad]] (Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh) is repeated six times along the sides of the [[hexagon]], and the word [[Ali]] (Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib) three times in a rotating wise in the inner hexagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hacali Necefoğlu |title=Turkish Crystallografic Patterns: From Ancient to Present |url=http://www.crystallography.fr/mathcryst/pdf/istanbul/Necefoglu_text.pdf |accessdate=2011-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One pattern on the scroll consists of nine-pointed and eleven-pointed geometric [[star polygon#Star figures|star figures]], and other one thirteen-pointed and sixteen-pointed geometric star figures. In the [[Islamic art]], this sort of stars were developed by folding certain patterns along the sides of a square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cromwell, P.

Some of the drawings on the scroll are formed by overlapped patterns of different scales. This feature is seen frequently in [[Islamic architecture]]. Detailed patterns within an ornament appear when one gets closer to a building with figures, which are difficult to perceive from the distance.&lt;ref name="cromwell"/&gt;

The '''UNESCO 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transport of Ownership of Cultural Property''' is an [[international treaty]].&lt;ref name="unesco-main" /&gt; The treaty, signed to combat illegal trade of cultural items, was signed 14 November 1970, and came under effect on 24 April 1972. As of September 2018, 137 states have ratified the treaty.&lt;ref name="unesco-conventions"/&gt;

== History ==
Before the 1970 [[UNESCO]] convention, the illegal trade of antique objects and cultural items was prevalent among the trade of drugs and weapons. Therefore, several sovereign states set about to preserve important historical and culturally significant objects.&lt;ref name="1970-strengths"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prott|first=Lyndel V.|title=Strengths and Weaknesses of the 1970 Convention: An Evaluation 40 years after its adoption|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CLT/pdf/Prott_2_en.pdf|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="study-convention"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reichelt|first=Gerte|title=Study on The Protection of Cultural Property|url=http://www.unidroit.org/english/documents/1986/study70/s-70-01-e.pdf|publisher=UNIDROIT|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These actions were a prelude to UNESCO's wide-scale attempt on the manners of preserving cultural objects.

The conception of the treaty began in April 1964, when UNESCO appointed a Committee of Experts from thirty states in April 1964. In 1968, UNESCO adopted ''Resolution 3.334''&lt;ref name="unesco-conference-1968"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001140/114047e.pdf#xml=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgibin/ulis.pl?database=gcex&amp;set=52442A6D_0_194&amp;hits_rec=2&amp;hits_lng=eng |title=UNESCO — Records of the General Conference — Fifteenth Session — 1968, Paris — Resolutions |last=UNESCO |first=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |website=unesco.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515222944/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001140/114047e.pdf#xml=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgibin/ulis.pl?database=gcex&amp;set=52442A6D_0_194&amp;hits_rec=2&amp;hits_lng=eng |archive-date=2018-05-15 |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;, authorizing the creation of a committee to draft a convention. The UNESCO Director-General appointed a principal expert and four consultants to draft the text on the convention, for later review by each member state. Upon its revision, the text was sent to a Special Committee of Governmental Experts, which prepared a final draft around April 1970.

The convention was attended by 61 states, and then adopted at the 16th General Conference on 14 November 1970.

== Details ==
Under the 1970 Convention, ''cultural property'' is under protection. Cultural property includes anything of scientific, historical, artistic, and or religiously significant, as defined by Article I of the convention.&lt;ref name="convention-text"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13039&amp;language=E |title=Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transport of Ownership of Cultural Property |last=UNESCO |first=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |website=UNESCO.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515224254/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D13039%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |archive-date=2018-05-15 |access-date=2018-05-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, every state can define its own ''cultural property'', as long as it is an item of importance and within the categories defined in Article I.

The Convention recommends the enforcement of the protection of cultural property in "three main pillars", each being ''preventive measures'', ''restitution provisions'', and ''international cooperation''. The first pillar, ''preventive measures'', states that those signed to the treaty are to enforce the security and safety of cultural property, such as taking inventory, exportation certifications, monitoring of trade, and imposition of penal sanctions. The second pillar, ''restitution provisions'', states that each sovereign state is to assist one another in the recuperation of stolen cultural property. The third pillar, ''international cooperation'', is an attempt by the convention to strengthen international ties between signatories, and to provide assistance and cooperation with one another.&lt;ref name="convention-text" /&gt;

Finally, under the convention, any party may seek the recovery and assistance of another state for the recovery of stolen or illegally exported cultural property imported into another state party, albeit only after the enforcement of the Convention in both states. However, the import or export of any cultural property is not legitimized, and can still fall under the terms of the convention.&lt;ref name="convention-text" /&gt;

== Statutory bodies ==
Under the Convention, several statutory bodies have been created to oversee the execution of the treaty's goals.

=== Meeting of States Parties ===
The Meeting of the States Parties to the 1970 Convention is the sovereign body of the convention. Made up of all the parties that are signed to the 1970 convention, this body organizes strategies and plans of action for the implementation of the convention. They met for the fourth time in May 2017.&lt;ref name="meeting-of-states-parties"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/meeting-of-states-parties |title=Meeting of States Parties |last=UNESCO |first=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |website=UNESCO.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515230253/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/meeting-of-states-parties |archive-date=2018-05-15 |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsidiary Committee ===
The Subsidiary Committee of the Meeting of States Parties to the 1970 Convention is a statutory body of the 1970 Convention, made of 18 members from the states signed to the convention on 4-year terms, which are controlled by the Meeting of States Parties.&lt;ref name="subsidiary-committee"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/subsidiary-committee |title=Subsidiary Committee |last=UNESCO |first=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |website=UNESCO.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515230513/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/subsidiary-committee |archive-date=2018-05-15 |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its main functions are to not only promote the convention, but to review and inform the Meeting of States Parties, and to identify key problems in the Convention. 
=== UNESCO Secretariat to the 1970 Convention ===

The UNESCO Secretariat of the 1970 Convention assists the Meetings of States Parties by organizing meetings for the Meetings of States Parties and other statutory branches of the convention and assisting in the development of resources and materials regarding the convention.&lt;ref name="publications"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/publications/ |title=Publications |last=UNESCO |first=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |website=UNESCO.org |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee ===
The UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in Case of Illicit Appropriation (ICPRCP), or UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee, was created to provide assistance in the recuperation of cultural property. Every two years, half of its 22 members are elected for 4 year terms. As an advisory body, this committee serves the direct assistance in the retrieval of property stolen via illicit trade.&lt;ref name="intergovermental-committee"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/restitution-of-cultural-property |title=Restitution of Cultural Property |last=UNESCO |first=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also serves as a possible place for dispute resolution.&lt;ref name="unesco-conference-2005"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001405/140517e.pdf#page=3 |title=UNESCO.

The Intergovermental Committee also manages the International Fund for the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in Case of Illicit Appropriation.&lt;ref name="fund"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/restitution-of-cultural-property/fund-of-the-committee|title=Fund of the Committee|date=|website=|access-date=2018-05-15|last=UNESCO |first=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects ===
Under UNESCO's request, [[UNIDROIT]] drafted the UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally exported Cultural Objects.&lt;ref name="UNIDROIT-convention"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.unidroit.org/instruments/cultural-property/1995-convention |title=UNIDROIT - Cultural Property - 1995 Convention |last=UNIDROIT |first=Institut international pour l'unification du droit privé |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a body of private law for the international art trade to assist the efforts of the 1970 convention, which it reinforces with legal rules. It seeks to end technical problems resulting from different laws in different states, and to contribute in the effort against illegal trade of cultural items.

== Key partners ==
Several agencies and organizations have assisted the 1970 Convention, including:
* [[European Union]]
* [[Interpol]] – Works of Art Unit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.interpol.int/en/Internet/Crime-areas/Works-of-art/Works-of-art |title=Works of art / Works of art / Crime areas / Internet / Home - Interpol |last=INTERPOL |first=International Criminal Police Organization |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects|UNIDROIT]]  
* [[UNODC|The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)]]  
* [[World Customs Organization|The World Customs Organization (WCO)]]

=== Non-governmental organizations ===
*The [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM)

== Logo ==
The 1970 Convention consists of two images; a hand superimposed upon a vase. It is meant to represent the end (hand) of the illegal trade of cultural items (vase).

[[Image:Proposed area of Vasconic languages.png|thumb|Proposed area of Vasconic substratum]]
The '''Vasconic substratum theory''' is a proposal that several western European languages contain remnants of an old [[language family]] of [[Vasconic languages]], of which [[Basque language|Basque]] is the only surviving member. The proposal was made by the German linguist [[Theo Vennemann]], but has been rejected by other linguists.

According to Vennemann, Vasconic languages were once widespread on the European continent before they were mostly replaced by [[Indo-European languages]]. Relics of these languages include [[toponymy|toponyms]] across Central and Western Europe.

Theo Vennemann (2003) proposes that after the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]], Vasconic people (perhaps coming from Africa) resettled all of [[Western Europe]]. They gave names to the rivers and places. These names often persisted after the Vasconic languages were replaced by Indo-European languages in most of their area. The present Basque area in northern Spain and southern France is postulated to be a relic.

In support of this argument, Vennemann cites, ''inter alia'':
* cultural similarities noted by [[Marija Gimbutas]];{{Example needed|date=May2017}}
* parallels in geographical [[toponym]]s  which may be relics of a [[Indo-European substrate hypotheses|pre-Indo-European]] [[substratum]], including
** numerous examples from [[Old European hydronymy]] and maritime terminology, noted by scholars such as [[Hans Krahe]], that do not necessarily have an Indo-European root, such as words in [[West Germanic languages]] for "sea" (Dutch ''zee'') and "ice" (Dutch ''ijs'') that are similar to their respective Basque counterparts, i.e. ''itsaso'' and ''itzotz'', 
** the similarity of names like [[Val d'Aran]], [[Arundel]], and [[Arendal]] to (for example) the [[Standard Basque]] word ''haran'' "valley";
* other linguistic elements, especially
** [[vigesimal]] ("base-20") counting/numerical systems, which Vennemann regards as a trait of Vasconic languages, in [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[French language|French]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], the [[Resian dialect]] of Slovenian,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and [[Danish language|Danish]];
* evidence from [[genetics]] and [[blood type]]s, which show that the modern [[Basque people]] share physical characteristics with old populations throughout Western  and Central Europe, especially in likely [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] areas, such as mountain ranges.

Vennemann developed his ideas in a series of papers which were collected in a book called ''Europa Vasconica - Europa Semitica''. A long critical review of this appeared in ''Lingua'' 116.&lt;ref name=lingua&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldi|first1=Philip|last2=Page|first2=B. Richard|title=Europa Vasconica-Europa Semitica|journal=[[Lingua (journal)|Lingua]]|date=December 2006|volume=116|issue=12|pages=2183–2220|doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2005.03.011|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384105000690|accessdate=January 26, 2015|quote=Abstract: In this review article we evaluate Theo Vennemann's provocative theories on the role of Afroasiatic and Vasconic (e.g. Basque) languages in the pre-historic development of Indo-European languages in Europe as presented in the volume Europa Vasconica-Europa Semitica, a collection of 27 of Vennemann's essays...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis has been largely rejected by historical linguists.
* Vennemann's theories on "Vasconic" toponymy and hydronymy were opposed by linguists such as P. R. Kitson (1996),&lt;ref&gt;P.R. Kitson; ''British and European River-Names'' in Transactions of the Philological Society 94, 73-118 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; and Baldi &amp; Richard (2006), who pointed out that most linguists see unusual European hydronyms as more likely to have Indo-European roots of some kind.&lt;ref name=lingua /&gt;
* German linguist Dieter H. Steinbauer argued that it is difficult to argue on the basis of Basque because:
** its status as an [[language isolate|isolate]] means that there is insufficient historical data for the reconstruction of the substratal language and;
** Basque itself has adopted many words from Indo-European languages.
* Steinbauer also criticised Vennemann for
** assuming that a Vasconic substratal language would necessarily share with Basque a feature of root words with initial [[consonant clusters]];{{Example needed|date=December 2014}}
** ignoring indications that the ancient [[Etruscan language]] seems more closely related to western [[Anatolian languages]], and for
** several methodological flaws, concluding that "a scientific discourse with Vennemann must face insurmountable obstacles".&lt;ref&gt;*{{de icon}} Dieter H.

"'''When We Dead Awaken: Writing as Re-Vision,'''" originally published in ''College English'' in the fall of 1972,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westga.edu/~aellison/Other/Rich.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is an essay by American feminist, poet, teacher, and writer [[Adrienne Rich]] (1929-2012). It discusses several concepts needed by women writers to enable them to overcome the conditioning of a patriarchal sense of literary aesthetics and history. The essay, originally a lecture delivered by Rich at a women’s writer convention, emphasizes the need for re-visioning of old texts, renaming of the various aspects of women which have been distorted by a male point of view, and developing a new form of writing that is free of the haunting male gaze, of convention and propriety and of the ‘male’ language and its implications.

Rich says that the act of re-visioning would help women to analyze and to act on “how we live, how we have been living, how we have been led to imagine ourselves, how our language has trapped as well as liberated us, how the very act of naming has been till now a male prerogative, how we can begin to see and name – and therefore live – afresh.”&lt;ref name="Rich, p. 35"&gt;Rich, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations behind the essay==
The essay by Rich was written to support her gender, to let women know that they need to break from the roles which society places upon them. “Until we can understand the assumptions in which we are drenched we cannot know ourselves.”.&lt;ref&gt;Rich&lt;/ref&gt; Rich stood up for the fact that women had a chance to no longer be afraid to embrace who they are, their individuality; the person that they were other than when they were conforming to societies norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Rich invested in the term, “fresh eyes”&lt;ref name="Rich, p. 35"/&gt; with which she wanted women to see the world with “fresh eyes,” or seeing the world with a new outlook. An outlook where women do not have to be dominated by men, an outlook where women have a voice and have control as well. Finally, writing the essay was an attempt for Rich’s own self-knowledge, in which she works to find her own self-identification. Although she wanted to motivate women in a male-dominated society, she was also motivating herself to refuse self-destructiveness in the male-dominated world.

==Literary connections==
The title of the essay is from the play [[When We Dead Awaken]] by [[Henrik Ibsen]]. The theme of Ibsen's play is the desire and appreciation of life. The play surrounds Irena, a former model and mysterious character, and her idea that although they have been alive, they have not been living. “When we dead awaken we find that we have never lived.”.&lt;ref&gt;Irena, ''When We Dead Awaken''&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of living as opposed to just being alive can be connected to Rich’s theme about women being degraded by society. Although the women that she writes for have been alive, they have not been fully living their lives. Her essay's goal is to motivate women, including herself, to stand up for their rights as human beings: to be equal to the men in a society ruled by men.
As Ibsen did in his play, Rich encourages women to “live,” breaking out of their closed shells to do what they want, rather than following what society tells them they must do.

==Personal context: gender and creativity==
Adrienne Rich was married and had three children during the 1950s. Rich described the fifties as a time when “middle-class women were making careers of domestic perfection”.&lt;ref name=R42&gt;Rich, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; After having her third child, Rich feared she lost touch with whomever she had been prior to assuming the traditional gender role of wife and mother. The wife-mother role according to Rich required a “putting aside” of the imaginative activity necessary in creative writing.&lt;ref  name=R42/&gt; This imaginative activity requires a “freedom of the mind” that transcends and transforms daily experiences by questioning, challenging and conceiving alternatives in regards to reality.&lt;ref name=R43&gt;Rich, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Rich states that being “a female human being trying to fulfill traditional female functions in a traditional way is in direct conflict with the subversive functions of the imagination.”&lt;ref name=R43/&gt;

Rich desired time to think and to write, but she felt that there was never enough time due to the full-time job of being a mother and a wife. The fifties and the early sixties were "years of revelations" for Rich and she needed to think for herself and about her relationship to the ideas of “pacifism and dissent and violence, poetry and society”.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Rich was beginning to feel that politics was not simply external, but also internal and “of the essence of her condition.&lt;ref&gt;"...politics was not something 'out there' but something 'in here'...", Rich, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; She then began to write directly about her experiences as a woman whenever she had the time. It was at this point that Rich noticed the "fragments and scraps" had “a common theme and a common consciousness” that she had been unwilling to put on paper before, as she had been taught that poetry had to be "universal". This “universal” style meant "nonfemale" and connected to Rich’s previous acknowledgment of her style as having  been formed at first by male poets.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, she tried hard not to identify herself as a female poet. The common themes she found in her work at this time included resistance and rebellion regarding gender roles and stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "reawakening"==
Rich believed that the anger felt by women throughout the ages was necessary for creativity and change to flourish. The "victimization and anger experienced by women are real", according to Rich, "and have real sources, everywhere in the environment, built into society, language, the structure of thought."&lt;ref name=R49&gt;Rich, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich speaks of "a new generation of women poets" moving towards the "new space" on the boundaries of patriarchy. Women, according to Rich, are "speaking to and of women due to a newly unleashed courage to name, to love each other, to share risk and grief and celebration."&lt;ref name=R49/&gt; Rich ends the essay by stating that women have much to do, as the "creative energy of patriarchy is running out, leaving only its self-generating energy for destruction."&lt;ref name=R49/&gt;

[[Image:Blessing genie Dur Sharrukin.jpg|thumb|A four-winged genie in the [[Bucket and cone]] motif. Relief from the north wall of the Palace of king [[Sargon II]] at [[Dur Sharrukin]], 713–716 BC.]]
'''Winged genie''' is the conventional term for a recurring motif in the iconography of [[Assyrian sculpture]].
Winged genies are usually bearded male figures sporting birds' [[wing]]s. The Genii are a reappearing trait in ancient [[Assyrian art]], and are displayed most prominently in palaces or places of royalty.  The two most notable places where the genius existed were [[Ashurnasirpal II]]’s palace [[Kalhu]] and [[Sargon II]]’s palace [[Dur-Sharrukin]].

== Variations of style ==

They appear in the reliefs of the walls and throughout the temples and palaces in a wide variety of ways.  There are three common stylistic tendencies in reliefs with genii.  First there are bearded, winged figures wearing a horned helmet.  Next there are bearded, winged figures wearing a diadem instead of helmet.  Finally there are winged, muscular, male figures with bird heads.  They are usually adorned with rosettes on their [[diadem]] and/or wrists.  Most often they are wearing a short sleeved, knee-length tunic with a tasseled hem.  Over the tunic is an ankle length fringed shawl that covers the near leg, wraps around the body and drapes the left shoulder, with the end hanging down the back to the waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Paul|title=An Assyrian-Style Ivory Plaque from Hansalu, Iran|journal=Metropolitan Museum Journal|year=2006|volume=41|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

These genii have all been interpreted as beings known as [[antediluvian]] sages or '''[[apkallu]]''' in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].  They were beings that existed during a godlike generation of humanity.  These beings were closely associated with the god [[Enki]].  During the antediluvian age humanity was "covered" or more commonly referred to as the [[great flood]], and the inhabitants were purified and roamed the earth as invisible genii.  There are also other references to the apkallus as being purified humans that were sent to [[Apsû]], the underground sweet water realm of Enki/Ea by [[Marduk]] the ruler god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atac|first=Mehment-Ali|title=Visual Formula and Meaning in Neo Assyrian Relief Sculpture|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=March 2006|volume=88|issue=1|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==

Aside from their wardrobe, the genii were created with several different functioning symbols.  Several genii are shown carrying a small quadruped. This small creature, possibly a fawn or gazelle, had been interpreted as being a representation of a [[scapegoat]]. This creature was used to contain the spirit of an exorcised demon. The genii would hold the quadruped to show its supernatural protective powers for the king and his people.  The other interpretation of this symbol lies with it association with abundance.  The genii shown holding the quadruped represents the divine reasoning for the kingdom's abundance and protection over said abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Paul|title=An Assyrian-Style Ivory Plaque from Hansalu, Iran|journal=Metropolitan Museum Journal|year=2006|volume=41|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other depictions of genii show them holding what appear to be a pine cone and a pail. These two elements are commonly associated with the [[Tree of Life]].  Many interpretations have stated that the depiction is of the genii fertilizing the tree and tending to it. Other interpretations place the pine cone as an object known as a '''mu-li-la''', and in conjunction with the pail, is used to avert evil forces whether real or supernatural.  Another interpretation stated that the tree and sun above it represent the distinction between heaven and earth.  Some theories state that these symbols are directly related to the cult of [[Assur]], where the sun symbolizes [[Shamash]] the sun god and the tree symbolizes Assur himself. Therefore, it is inferred that the genii protecting the tree represent the supernatural forces that the Assyrians believed were protecting the earth and more importantly the [[Assyrian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grace|first=Fredrick|title=An Assyrian Winged Genius|journal=Bulletin of the Fogg Art Museum|date=March 1940|volume=9|issue=2|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similarity to the king ==

Due to the ornate nature of the kings and genii, there are many times in which the distinction between the king and a genie are impossible.  They are dressed in identical clothes and if the genie has no wings there is nothing separating it from a human.  Both genii and the king would wear earrings made of a single conical-tipped pendant suspended from a crescent.  Also if a genie was bearded there would be nothing different from a beard on that of a human.  The standard beard of a human consisted three layers, and the genie would have the same as well.  Variations of beards later on do exist, but still do not distinguish the genii from the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Paul|title=An Assyrian-Style Ivory Plaque from Hansalu, Iran|journal=Metropolitan Museum Journal|year=2006|volume=41|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cross culture influence ==

Winged genii co-existed with numerous other [[mythological hybrid]]s in the Early Iron Age art of Assyria and Asia Minor. They influenced [[Archaic Greece]] during its "[[orientalizing period]]", resulting in the hybrid creatures of Greek mythology such as the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], the [[Griffin]] or [[Pegasus]] and, in the case of the "winged man", [[Talos]]. The orientalizing period has its origin in Early Iron Age (9th century BC) [[Crete]], where bearded and winged figures clearly inspired by Assyrian templates are found engraved in bronze bowls and other artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Pendlebury |work=The Archaeology of Crete |year=1991 |page=336 |url=http://www.cycladic.gr/frontoffice/portal.asp?cpage=resource&amp;cresrc=1176&amp;cnode=55 |title=The "orientalizing" period in Greek art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "winged man" also makes an appearance among the [[Chayot]] of [[Ezekiel]]'s [[Merkabah]] vision, and via {{bibleverse||Revelation|4:7|KJV}} becomes the symbol of [[Matthew the Evangelist]]. The [[Seraphim]] of [[Isaiah]] (6:1–3) have six wings each.
