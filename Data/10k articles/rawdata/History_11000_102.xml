      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13309">'''Abu Bakr II''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 14th century), also spelled '''Abubakri''' and known as '''Mansa Qu''', may have been the ninth [[Mansa (title)|mansa]] of the [[Mali Empire]]. He succeeded his nephew Mansa [[Mohammed ibn Gao]] and preceded [[Musa I of Mali|Mansa Musa]]. Abu Bakr II abdicated his throne in order to explore "the limits of the ocean".

==Background==
Abu Bakar was one of two sons of Cheikh Anta Diop, a sister of the founding emperor [[Sundiata Keita]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} He was the last of a mini-dynasty within the Keita clan of emperors descending from Kolonkan. After his abdication in 1311, the Faga Laye mini-dynasty would control the empire.

==Reign==
Virtually all that is known of Abu Bakr II is from the account of [[Chihab al-Umari]].&lt;ref name="al-Umari"&gt;Al-Umari 1929, ''Masalik al Absar fi Mamalik el-Amsar'', French translation by Gaudefroy-Demombynes, Paris, Paul Geuthner, 1927, pp. 59, 74-75. See also Qalqashandi, ''Subh al-A'sha, V'', 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Umari visited Cairo after [[Mansa Musa]] stopped there during his historic [[hajj]] to [[Mecca]], and recorded a conversation between Musa and his host, Abu'l Hasan Ali ibn Amir Habib. According to Musa, Abu Bakr became convinced that he could find the edge of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and outfitted two expeditions to find it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/legend-how-mansa-abu-bakr-ii-mali-gave-throne-explore-atlantic-ocean-005392 "The Legend of How Mansa Abu Bakr II of Mali Gave up the Throne to Explore the Atlantic Ocean"], ''Ancient Origins,'' 21 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abbas Hamdani 1994"&gt;"Abbas Hamdani, An Islamic Background to the Voyages of Discovery. Language and Literature" in ''The Legacy of Muslim Spain'' (Studien Und Texte Zur Geistesgeschichte Des Mittelalters), 1994, ed. [[Salma Khadra Jayyusi]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, 9, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hussain Bukhari |first1=Zahid |title=Muslims' Place in the American Public Square: Hope, Fears, and Aspirations|date=1 Jan 2004 |publisher=Rowman Altamira |isbn=0759106134 |pages=xvi of 396 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=jXl2Z2PI3xMC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=abubakr+mali+ships&amp;q=abubakr%20mali%20ships}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Abu Bakr II's failure to return from the second of those expeditions, Mansa Musa acceded to the throne.

===Atlantic expeditions===

The Arab-Egyptian scholar [[Al-Umari]]&lt;ref name="al-Umari"/&gt; quotes Mansa Musa as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;The ruler who preceded me did not believe that it was impossible to reach the extremity of the ocean that encircles the earth (meaning Atlantic), and wanted to reach that (end) and obstinately persisted in the design. So he equipped two hundred boats full of men, as many others full of gold, water and victuals sufficient enough for several years. He ordered the chief (admiral) not to return until they had reached the extremity of the ocean, or if they had exhausted the provisions and the water. They set out. Their absence extended over a long period, and, at last, only one boat returned. On our questioning, the captain said: 'Prince, we have navigated for a long time, until we saw in the midst of the ocean as if a big river was flowing violently. My boat was the last one; others were ahead of me. As soon as any of them reached this place, it drowned in the whirlpool and never came out. I sailed backwards to escape this current.' But the Sultan would not believe him. He ordered two thousand boats to be equipped for him and for his men, and one thousand more for water and victuals. Then he conferred on me the regency during his absence, and departed with his men on the ocean trip, never to return nor to give a sign of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=646|title=Echos of What Lies Behind the 'Ocean of Fogs' in Muslim Historical Narratives|work=Muslim Heritage |author= Mohammed Hamidullah | accessdate=27 June 2015}}  (Quoting from Al-Umari 1927, ''q.v.'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Trans-Atlantic travel===
[[Ivan van Sertima]] and Malian researcher Gaoussou Diawara, proposed that Abu Bakr II traveled to the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garifunaheritagefoundation.org/285.html Garifuna Foundation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726073616/http://www.garifunaheritagefoundation.org/285.html |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1068950.stm Africa's Greatest Explorer - BBC (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; Van Sertima cites the abstract of Columbus's log made by [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], according to which the purpose of Columbus's third voyage was to test both the claims of King [[John II of Portugal]] that "canoes had been found which set out from the coast of Guinea [West Africa] and sailed to the west with merchandise" as well as the claims of the native inhabitants of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola that "from the south and the southeast had come black people whose spears were made of a metal called [[guanín]]&amp;nbsp;... from which it was found that of 32 parts: 18 were gold, 6 were silver, and 8 copper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morison|first=Samuel Eliot|title=Journals and Other Documents on the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus|year=1963|publisher=The Heritage Press|location=New York|pages=262, 263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thacher|first=John Boyd|title=Christopher Columbus: his life, his work, his remains, as revealed by original printed and manuscript records, together with an essay on Peter Martyr of Anghera and Bartolomé De Las Casas, the first Historians of America|year=1903|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|location=New York|pages=379, 380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another supporting claim was made by [[Washington Irving]], in his ''Life of Columbus'', who wrote that in 1503 Columbus was on the Mosquito Coast. "There was no pure gold to be met with here, all their ornaments were of guanine; but the natives assured the Adelantado that in proceeding along the coast, the ships would soon arrive at a country where gold was in abundance".&lt;ref&gt;Bollaert, W. (1860).

However, many archaeologists, anthropologists, ethnohistorians, linguists, and other modern pre-Columbian scholars say that there is no evidence of any such voyage reaching the Americas, and that there are insufficient evidential grounds to suppose there has been contact between Africa and the [[New World]] at any point in the pre-Columbian era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Haslip-Viera |first1= Gabriel |last2= Ortiz de Montellano|first2= Bernard |last3= Barbour |first3= Warren|date= 1997 |title= Robbing Native American Cultures: Van Sertima's Afrocentricity and the Olmecs |url= |journal= Current Anthropology |volume=38 |issue= 3|pages=419–441 |doi=10.1086/204626 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For views representative of this point of view, see the considerations on the question advanced in Haslip-Viera ''et al.'' (1997), who for example note "no genuine African artifact has ever been found in a controlled archaeological excavation in the New World". See also the supporting responses in peer-review printed in the article, by David Browman, [[Michael D. Coe]], Ann Cyphers, Peter Furst, and other academics active in the field. Ortiz de Montellano ''et al.'' (1997, ''passim.'') continues the case against Africa-Americas contacts. Other prominent Mesoamerican specialists such as UCR Riverside anthropology professor [[Karl Taube]] are confident that "There simply is no material evidence of any Pre-Hispanic contact between the Old World and Mesoamerica before the arrival of the Spanish in the sixteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;(Taube 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;/ref&gt;

A BBC article titled "Africa's greatest explorer" summarizes the controversy from the perspectives of the scholars and historians in Mali.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

[[image:Hektor ransom BM E75.jpg|thumb|Priam (right) entering the hut of Achilles in his effort to ransom the body of Hector. The figure at left is probably one of Achilles' servant boys. (Attic [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] of the early fifth century BCE)]]

The '''''Achilleis''''' (after the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἀχιλληΐς}}, ''Achillēis'', {{IPA-el|akʰillɛːís|pron}}) is a lost [[trilogy]] by the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[Theatre of ancient Greece|dramatist]] [[Aeschylus]].  The three plays that make up the ''Achilleis'' exist today only in fragments, but aspects of their overall content can be reconstructed with reasonable certainty. Like the ''[[Oresteia]]'' which forms "a narratively connected unit with a continuous plot,"&lt;ref&gt;Gantz (1980) 133.&lt;/ref&gt; the trilogy had a unified focus, presumably treating the story of [[Achilles]] at [[Trojan War|Troy]] in a version comparable to the plot of the latter two-thirds of the ''[[Iliad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz (1980) 145.&lt;/ref&gt; In the '''''Myrmidons''''' ({{lang|grc|Μυρμιδόνες}}, ''Myrmidónes''), Achilles' refusal to fight after his quarrel with [[Agamemnon]] led to the death of [[Patroclus]]. The title of the play traditionally placed second in the trilogy is the '''''Nereids''''' ({{lang|grc|Νηρείδες}}, ''Nēreídes''). The chorus was thus a group of [[Nereid]]s, and the subject of the play involved Achilles and his Nereid mother [[Thetis]], probably her mourning his imminent death and the acquisition of his [[Shield of Achilles|new arms]]. In the '''''Phrygians''''' ({{lang|grc|Φρύγες}}, ''Phrýges'') or ''Ransom of Hector'' (Ἕκτορος λύτρα, ''Héktoros lútra''), [[Priam]] and a chorus of [[Phrygia]]ns sought to retrieve Hector's body from the still wroth Achilles.&lt;ref&gt;This summary of the most common reconstruction of the trilogy is based upon West (2000) 340&amp;ndash;42, though he does not agree with the traditional arrangement.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the trilogy's title ''Achilleis''&lt;ref&gt;This title, a [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] adjective formed from Achilles' name, is a modern construct that has been adopted based upon the naming habits of antiquity. Like ''[[Oresteia]]'' (cf. Aristophanes, ''Frogs'' 1124 with [[scholia]]), ''Achilleis'' is meant to be construed with a suppressed feminine noun: either trilogy ({{lang|grc|τριλογία}}, ''trilogía'') or [[tetralogy]] ({{lang|grc|τετραλογία}}, ''tetralogía''), if referring to the three known plays and the unknown [[satyr play]] that would have followed. Cf. Gantz (1979) 291&amp;ndash;93 and (1980) 133&amp;ndash;34.&lt;/ref&gt; nor the grouping of the plays is explicitly attested from antiquity, but the existence of a unified trilogy with Achilles as its focus has long been accepted by modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F3H2g9ZDGfIC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=the+problematic+hero:+aeschylus%27+myrmidons&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9IBFTurZJcnXgQeD5oSoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mikelachis (2002) 22 with n. 1]. Welcker (1824) 310 was the first to propose both the title and the grouping; cf. Gantz (1979) 289.&lt;/ref&gt; In his commentary on ''[[Oresteia|The Libation Bearers]]'', Garvie states that it is "highly likely that Aeschylus often, though not always (of the surviving plays ''[[The Persians|Persae]]'' is an almost certain exception) composed trilogies consisting of tragedies connected in their subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;Garvie (1986) xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the ''Oresteia'' (to which 'The Libation Bearers' belongs), the ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]'' and ''[[The Suppliants (Aeschylus)|Suppliants]]'' formed part of connected trilogies, as did the lost plays that make up the ''[[Lycurgeia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz (1980) 136&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[satyr play]]s that accompanied these examples had plots related to those of the tragedies, and it has been suggested that the ''Achilleis'' might also have been followed by a comedic play related to its dramatic content, but there is no evidence as to what the subject of this satyr play might have been.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz (1980) 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the ''Achilleis'' survives in fragments, its text is comparatively more fluid than that of ancient texts with medieval [[manuscript]] traditions. During the first half of the 20th century [[papyrus]] fragments of numerous lost Aeschylean plays, including the ''Myrmidons'', were discovered that added much material to, and greatly altered the modern conception of, the dramatist's corpus. Given this fluidity, it is especially important to consult the most current [[Textual criticism|critical edition]] or translations of the text, since  earlier editions will likely not reflect the advances of the past century. In the case of the fragments of Aeschylus, the edition of record is the third volume of ''[[Achilleis (trilogy)#Critical editions|Tragicorum Graecorum fragmenta]]'' edited by [[:de:Stefan Radt|Stefan Radt]] (1985). While it is now customary to refer to the text and numeration of Radt, the majority of the fragments of the ''Achilleis'' can also be found in [[:de:Hans Joachim Mette|Mette]]'s 1959 edition. For example, fr. 140 Radt and 232 Mette refer to the same three-word fragment of the ''Myrmidons'', uttered (in Mette's opinion) by Achilles: "Arms! I want arms!" ({{lang|grc|ὅπλων ὅπλων δεῖ}}, ''hóplōn hóplōn deî''). Sommerstein's [[#Translations|Loeb]] is the most current English translation and follows the numeration of Radt, as does this article.

==The trilogy==
Given [[Aeschylus]]' tendency to write connected trilogies, three plays attested in the catalogue of his work have been supposed to constitute the ''Achilleis'': ''Myrmidons'', ''Nereids'' and ''Phrygians'' (alternately titled ''The Ransoming of Hector'').  Despite the paucity of surviving text, the ''Myrmidons'' has achieved some measure of fame, because of [[Aristophanes]]' satire of it at ''[[The Frogs|Frogs]]'' 911&amp;ndash;13 in which [[Euripides]] mocks Aeschylus' stagecraft:
[[image:Achilles embassy Louvre G264 n2.jpg|thumb|right]]
&lt;blockquote style="margin-left:250px;"&gt;
: πρώτιστα μὲν γὰρ ἕνα τιν' ἂν καθῖσεν ἐγκαλύψας,
: Ἀχιλλέα τιν' ἢ Νιόβην, τὸ πρόσωπον οὐχὶ δεικνύς,
: πρόσχημα τῆς τραγῳδίας, γρύζοντας οὐδὲ τουτί.

: At the very beginning he sits someone alone, enshrouded,
: some Achilles or Niobe, not showing the mask,
: the ornament of tragedy, mumbling not even this much.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This play, along with the also lost ''[[Niobe]]'', are two famous examples cited in antiquity of the often-discussed theme of the "Aeschylean silence".

===''Myrmidons''===

''Myrmidons'' (frr. 131&amp;ndash;42 Radt; 211&amp;ndash;35 Mette) concerned Achilles' refusal to fight for the Greeks, which tragically leads to the killing of his companion Patroclus by the Trojan hero, Hector; this death persuades Achilles to rejoin the fight.

===''Nereids''===

In ''Nereids'' (frr. 150&amp;ndash;54 Radt; 236&amp;ndash;41 Mette), [[Thetis]] and a chorus of sea-nymphs bring Achilles his new armor. The remainder of the action probably would have concerned his revenge killing of Hector and Patroclus' funeral.

===''Phrygians''===

The action of ''Phrygians'' (frr. 263&amp;ndash;72 Radt; 242&amp;ndash;59 Mette) almost certainly corresponded with Book 24 of the ''[[Iliad]]'': Achilles' defilement of Hector's corpse and his eventually agreeing to ransom the body back to the grieving father, Priam.&lt;ref&gt;See (e.g.) Gregory 2005, 274–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The text==

A small number of verses from these three of Aeschylus' lost works have been saved: fifty-four from ''Myrmidons'', seven from ''Nereids'' and twenty-one from ''Phrygians.'' A sense of the pace at which additions to this corpus are made can be gleaned from the fact that a papyrus fragment containing seven letters on three lines that could be fitted over a two-line quote from [[Justin Martyr|Justin Martyr's]] dialogue ''[[Dialogue with Trypho|Trypho]]'', to show that the quote was in fact from the opening of ''Myrmidons'' was worth publishing in a note in ''Classical Philology'', 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Smethurst (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern adaptation==

The ''Achilleis'' and the circumstances of its transmission came to broader public notice in 2003 when ThoC, Cyprus' national theatre, announced that it would be staging an adaptation (by way of creative reconstruction) of the trilogy by Elias Malandris.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC News article on the announcement|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3269965.stm|accessdate=2011-08-12 | date=2003-11-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629071843/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3269965.stm| archivedate= 29 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malandris' ''Achilleis'', on which he had worked for more than a decade,&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; built upon classicist [[Bruno Snell|Bruno Snell's]] work on the fragments and filled out their content with material adapted from the ''Iliad'' and other ancient references to Achilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeschylus' 'Achilleis' trilogy to be restored and played|url=http://www.greekembassy.org/Embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office=1&amp;folder=419&amp;article=12488|accessdate=2011-08-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717014337/http://www.greekembassy.org/Embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office=1&amp;folder=419&amp;article=12488|archivedate=2011-07-17|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the process of staging a largely lost work of ancient tragedy, Andy Bargilly, then director of the Theatre, stated: "We do think it is a faithful adaptation to a large extent, but nobody can say 100 percent."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; The reconstructed trilogy premiered July 7, 2004, with [[Mario Frangoulis]] as Achilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive of performances at the Cyprus National Theatre (in Greek) |url=http://www.thoc.org.cy/gr/archive/Production.aspx?ProductionID=314 |accessdate=2011-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330161701/http://www.thoc.org.cy/gr/archive/Production.aspx?ProductionID=314 |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12913">'''Anne Dowriche''' (before 1560– after 1613)&lt;ref&gt;[http://orlando.cambridge.org/protected/svPeople?formname=r&amp;subform=1&amp;person_id=dowran Anne Dowriche] at the Orlando Project, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[England|English]] poet and historian of the 16th century.

Anne Dowriche was the daughter of Sir Richard Edgecombe and Elizabeth Tregian Edgecombe, who were from a prominent family in [[Cornwall]]. In 1580, she married a [[Puritan]] minister from [[Devon]], with whom she had several children.&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Joann Ross, "Anne Dowriche" in Diana Maury Robin, Anne R. Larsen, and Carole Levin (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Women in the Renaissance: Italy, France, and England.'' Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2007; p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowriche wrote ''The French Historie'' about the [[French Wars of Religion]], "a 2,400 line poem, a long and inherently gory narrative epic about the long-winded French Wars of Religion during the C16",&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, Julie, ''Anne Dowriche/Edgcumbe's 'The French Historie' &amp; its Westcountry connections'', 2011 [http://scrapblogfromthesouth-west.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/anne-dowricheedgcumbes-french-historie.html]&lt;/ref&gt; in which she speaks out against tyranny and justifies the [[Protestant Reformation]]. She described several tyrants who were slain by subjects and gave an account of the gruesome death of [[Charles IX of France]], during whose reign the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] had taken place. After this, she addressed [[Elizabeth I of England]], calling upon her to protect and lead her Protestant subjects.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;Mihoko Suzuki, "Warning Elizabeth with Catherine de' Medici's Example, Anne Dowriche's French Historie and the Politics of Counsel" in Anne J. Cruz, and Mihoko Suzuki (eds.), ''The Rule of Women in Early Modern Europe.'' Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009; p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowriche also wrote ''Verses Written by a Gentlewoman, upon the Jailor's Conversion''. She is also credited for writing other poetry that has not survived.&lt;ref name="Ross" /&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===

Anne Edgecombe was born into the English gentry.&lt;ref&gt;White, Micheline, “Women Writers and Literary Religious Circles in the Elizabethan West Country: Anne Dowriche, Anne Lock Prowse, Anne Lock Moyle, Ursula Fulford, and Elizabeth Rous”, 2005: p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The Edgecombe family owned land and held a degree of economic and political power. The Edgecombes were ardent followers of the Protestant religion, which made them part of a minority in England and Europe as a whole. They were connected to a network of Protestants who used available literary talent, wealth, and power to promote Protestant causes.&lt;ref name="White 2005, p. 7"&gt;White 2005, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Anne was well educated as a girl, which is one indicator of her privileged social class. Some of Anne’s writing suggests that she may have been able to read Latin, which would be further evidence of the extent of her education.&lt;ref&gt;Bawcutt, N. W., “The ‘Myth of Gentillet’ Reconsidered: An Aspect of Elizabethan Machiavellianism”, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the Edgecombe family supported controversial Protestant activists. For instance, Anne’s brother Richard supported the Calvinist minister Melanchthon Jewell.&lt;ref name="White 2005, p. 11"&gt;White 2005, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewell preached illegally and was repeatedly imprisoned for his religious and political convictions. Despite this type of religious oppression, the Protestant faith was a cornerstone in Dowriche’s life and she was devoted to Protestant causes. Though she was limited by her gender at a time when women could not own property, Dowriche used her talents as a writer to promote her views.&lt;ref&gt;White 2005, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer [[Anne Locke]] was a fellow Protestant reformer who was connected to Dowriche through intermarried family members.&lt;ref&gt;White 2005, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Dowriche, Anne Locke was a female poet who also wrote in support of the Protestant faith. Some scholars have noted similarities between Locke’s poem entitled “The Necessitie and Benefite of Affliction,” and Dowriche’s “Verses Written by a Gentlewoman, Upon the Jaylor’s Conversion”.&lt;ref&gt;White 2005, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Both poems advocate Protestantism and encourage the reader to repent and follow God. Some scholars speculate that, given the women’s geographic and ideological proximity, Dowriche and Locke may have directly impacted one another’s writing.&lt;ref&gt;White 2005, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===

In 1580 Anne Edgecombe married Rev. Hugh Dowrich, rector of [[Honiton]] in Devon, the second son of Thomas Dowrish (d.1590) of [[Dowrich|Dowrish]]&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lambrick Vivian|Vivian, Lt. Col. J. L.]], (Ed.) The Visitations of the County of Devon: Comprising the  [[Heraldic visitation|Heralds' Visitations]] of 1531, 1564 &amp; 1620, Exeter, 1895, pedigree of "Dowrish of Dowrich" p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; in the parish of Sandford, near [[Crediton]], Devon. A small painted heraldic escutcheon survives on wood panelling at Dowrich displaying the arms of Dowrich (''Argent, a bend cotised sable a bordure engrailed of the last''&lt;ref&gt;[[William Pole (antiquary)|Pole, Sir William]] (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, [[Sir John de la Pole, 6th Baronet|Sir John-William de la Pole]] (ed.), London, 1791, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt;) [[impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] Edgcumbe (''Gules, on a bend ermine cottised or three boar's heads couped argent'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://scrapblogfromthesouth-west.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/anne-dowricheedgcumbes-french-historie.html See image]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient gentry family of Dowrish had become established at Dowrish before the reign of King John (1199–1216), when they built the keep&lt;ref&gt;Vivian, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; or gatehouse, which survives there today.&lt;ref&gt;[[William George Hoskins|Hoskins, W. G.]], A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1959 (first published 1954), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Anne and Hugh were united by their religious convictions, as both were ardent Protestants at a time when Europe was predominantly Catholic. Anne and Hugh had 6 children, Elkana, Walter, Mary (born 1587), Elizabeth, Anne (born 1589), and Hugh (born 1594).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kateemersonhistoricals.com/TudorWomenE.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
A Protestant, Dowriche supported Queen Elizabeth I, who faced death threats because she led a Protestant regime.&lt;ref&gt;Sondergard, Sidney L., ''Sharpening Her Pen: Strategies of Rhetorical violence by Early Modern English Women Writers'', 2002: p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially, Dowriche was a proponent of eradicating the Catholic faith, arguing that Protestantism was the rightful path to God. Dowriche was linked to other Protestants who also held the radical belief that Catholicism should be abolished.&lt;ref name="White 2005, p. 7"/&gt;

==Works==

Dowriche’s writings focus on the Protestant faith and what she viewed as the rightful path to God. In her poem ''The French Historie'', Dowriche wrote about the plight of French Protestants, a religious group which was persecuted during the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;. Martin, Randall, “Anne Dowriche's ‘The French History’, Christopher Marlowe, and Machiavellian Agency”, 1999: p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The French Historie''===

Dowriche published her 2,400-line poem ''The French Historie'' in 1589.&lt;ref&gt;Martin 1991, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem is a fictionalized retelling of the [[French Wars of Religion]], a bloody conflict primarily occurring between Catholics and Huguenots from 1562 to 1598. [[Huguenots]] were French Protestants who harshly criticized the Catholic Church. They were widely persecuted in France, which led to a mass exodus of Huguenots to other countries. Dowriche recalls the persecution of Huguenots with tales of Huguenot martyrs. By poetically describing the Huguenots’ resistance in the face of Catholic persecution, Dowriche endeavored to inspire English Protestants to rebel against Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Matchinske, Meagan, “Moral, Method, and History in Anne Dowriche’s The French Historie”, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

''The French Historie'' opens with a fictional exchange between an Englishman and a Huguenot refugee from France. Their exchange acts as a frame for the narrative of the poem, a common device in Elizabethan writing. The plight of the Huguenots in ''The French Historie'' echoes the stories of suffering and redemption of the Israelites in the Old Testament. Dowriche’s allusions to both contemporary and biblical texts are evidence that she was well read, an unusual trait for the majority of English women at this time.

''The French Historie'' chronicles three pivotal events in the French Wars of Religion, beginning with an uprising against Huguenots in Paris. The poem then moves to the execution of [[Anne du Bourg]], a counselor in the Parliament of Paris who opposed using capital punishment for crimes of heresy.&lt;ref&gt;Matchinske, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The third major event of the poem is a retelling of the bloody [[St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre]], an attack against Huguenots which began in Paris in 1572 and spread throughout France. Dowriche imagines the queen of France, the devoutly Catholic [[Catherine de Medici]], fiercely proposing the infamous St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre. While St. Bartholomew’s Massacre was a real series of events, Dowriche invented the detail that Catherine de Medici proposed the killings. Though Catherine de Medici is a villainous character in ''The French Historie'', Dowriche also imbues her and other female characters with capabilities which were traditionally ascribed only to men. Dowriche’s imagining of de Medici’s power, will, and ruthlessness subverts traditional representations of women as meek and submissive.

In ''The French Historie'', Dowriche characterizes the targeted murders of Huguenots as the work of Satan. Satan appears in the text to influence Catherine de Medici and others to commit atrocities. Dowriche sympathetically portrays Huguenot scholars and preachers who were martyred for their religious beliefs. Ultimately, the French narrator calls on Queen Elizabeth to defend Protestants in England.&lt;ref&gt;Matchinske, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The French Historie'' in relation to other literary works===

For historical information, Dowriche consulted [[Thomas Tymme]]’s ''The Three Partes of Commentaries, Containing the Whole and Perfect Discourse of the Civill Warres of Fraunce''. Tymme’s work is a translation of an earlier historical account written by [[[[Pierre_de_la_Place|Pierre de La Place]]]], who was killed during the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre. Numerous scholars argue that Dowriche’s ''The French Historie'' may have inspired Christopher Marlowe’s ''[[The Jew of Malta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hager, Alan, ''Encyclopedia of British Writers: 16th, 17th, and 18th Centuries'', 2005: p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Jew of Malta'', in turn, influenced William Shakespeare’s ''The Merchant of Venice''.

==="Verses Written by a Gentlewoman, Upon the Jaylor's Conversion"===

Anne Dowriche published her poem "Verses Written by a Gentlewoman, Upon a Jaylor’s Conversion" in her husband Hugh’s 1596 work, ''The Jaylor’s Conversion''. ''The Jaylor’s Conversion'' is a sermon describing Acts 16:30, in which the jailer of Paul and Silas experiences a conversion.&lt;ref&gt;White 2005, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh argued that this sermon, which he delivered 16 years before it was published, was relevant once more due to what he saw as a time of spiritual regression. Anne’s poem "Verses Written by a Gentlewoman, Upon the Jaylor’s Conversion" occurs in the prefatory material of Hugh’s sermon and follows a ballad meter. In her poem she criticizes magistrates who mask the truth as “sedition and conspiracy.”&lt;ref name="White 2005, p. 11"/&gt; Both Anne and Hugh praise believers who are willing to repent and sacrifice for God. They also emphasize willingness to suffer for one’s faith through imprisonment and are strongly anti-Catholic. In this respect, their writings are in keeping with the Puritan faction of the church, which also focused on resisting Catholicism. ''The Jaylor’s Conversion'' urges readers to completely submit to the Bible’s authority and admonishes what the Dowriche’s view as rampant spiritual lethargy. ''The Jaylor’s Conversion'' would have found a receptive audience among the network of Protestant activists and believers connected to Anne Dowriche.

The device, housed in the remains of a {{cvt|34|×|18|×|9|cm|in|adj=on}} wooden box, was found as one lump, later separated into three main fragments which are now divided into 82 separate fragments after conservation works. Four of these fragments contain gears, while inscriptions are found on many others.&lt;ref name=bibliotec/&gt;&lt;ref name=vetenskapens/&gt; The largest gear is approximately {{convert|14|cm|in}} in diameter and originally had 223 teeth.&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1/&gt;

It is a complex [[clockwork]] mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears. A team led by Mike Edmunds and Tony Freeth at [[Cardiff University]] used modern computer [[x-ray]] [[tomography]] and high resolution surface scanning to image inside fragments of the crust-encased mechanism and read the faintest inscriptions that once covered the outer casing of the machine.

Detailed imaging of the mechanism suggests that it had 37 gear wheels enabling it to follow the movements of the moon and the sun through the zodiac, to predict eclipses and even to model the [[Lunar month#Anomalistic month|irregular orbit of the moon]], where the moon’s velocity is higher in its [[Apsis|perigee than in its apogee]]. This motion was studied in the 2nd century BC by astronomer [[Hipparchus]] of [[Rhodes]], and it is speculated that he may have been consulted in the machine's construction.&lt;ref name=sample-06/&gt;

The knowledge of this technology was lost at some point in [[Late Antiquity|antiquity]], and technological works approaching its complexity and workmanship did not appear again until the development of mechanical [[astronomical clock]]s in Europe in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=marchant-06 /&gt; All known fragments of the Antikythera mechanism are kept at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]] in Athens, along with a number of artistic reconstructions/replicas of how the mechanism may have looked and worked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/museum "The Antikythera Mechanism at the National Archaeological Museum"].

===Discovery===
[[File:DerekdeSollaPrice.jpg|thumb|[[Derek J. de Solla Price]] (1922–1983) with a model of the Antikythera mechanism]]
The Antikythera mechanism was retrieved from {{convert|45|m}} of water in the [[Antikythera wreck|Antikythera shipwreck]] off Point Glyphadia on the Greek island of [[Antikythera]] in 1901, most probably in July of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/history|title=History - Antikythera Mechanism Research Project|website=www.antikythera-mechanism.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck had been found in April 1900 by a group of Greek [[Sponge diving|sponge divers]] who retrieved numerous large arte&lt;!-- 'e' - this article uses British spelling --&gt;facts, including bronze and marble statues,  pottery, unique glassware, jewellery, coins, and the mechanism.  All were transferred to the National Museum of Archaeology in Athens for storage and analysis. The mechanism was merely a lump of corroded bronze and wood at the time and went unnoticed for two years, while museum staff worked on piecing together more obvious statues.&lt;ref name=marchant-06/&gt;

On 17 May 1902, [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Valerios Stais]] found that one of the pieces of rock had a gear wheel embedded in it. He initially believed that it was an astronomical clock, but most scholars considered the device to be [[wikt:prochronistic|prochronistic]], too complex to have been constructed during the same period as the other pieces that had been discovered. Investigations into the object were dropped until British science historian and Yale University professor [[Derek J. de Solla Price]] became interested in it in 1951.&lt;ref name=haughton2006/&gt; In 1971, Price and Greek nuclear physicist Charalampos Karakalos made X-ray and [[Gamma camera|gamma-ray images]] of the 82 fragments. Price published an extensive 70-page paper on their findings in 1974.&lt;ref name=marchant-06 /&gt;

It is not known how the mechanism came to be on the cargo ship, but it has been suggested that it was being taken from [[Rhodes]] to [[Rome]], together with other looted treasure, to support a [[Roman triumph|triumphal parade]] being staged by [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref name=iol/&gt;

Two other searches for items at the Antikythera wreck site in 2012 and 2015 have yielded a number of fascinating art objects and a second ship which may or may not be connected with the treasure ship on which the Mechanism was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Missing Piece of Antikythera Mechanism Found on Aegean Seabed| url=https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-missing-piece-of-antikythera-mechanism-found-on-aegean-seabed-1.6640779| publisher=Haaretz| date=16 November 2018| accessdate=15 November 2018&lt;!--yes, dates are correct--&gt;| first=Philippe| last=Bohstrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also found was a bronze disk, with the image of a bull embellished on it.  The disk has four "ears" which have holes in them, and it was thought by some that it may have been part of the Antikythera Mechanism itself, as a "[[gear|cog wheel]]".  However, there appears to be little evidence that it was part of the Mechanism; it is more likely that the disk was a bronze decoration on a piece of furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| publisher=Smithsonian Magazine| title=No, Archaeologists Probably Did Not Find a New Piece of the Antikythera Mechanism| url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/no-archaeologists-probably-did-not-find-new-piece-antikythera-mechanism-180970821/| first=Jason| last=Daley| date=15 November 2018|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin===
The Antikythera mechanism is generally referred to as the first known [[analogue computer]].&lt;ref name=angelakis2006/&gt; The quality and complexity of the mechanism's manufacture suggests that it has undiscovered predecessors made during the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref name=allen-07/&gt; Its construction relied on theories of astronomy and mathematics developed by Greek astronomers during the second century BC, and it is estimated to have been built in the late second century BC&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt; or the early first century BC&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars", ''Hesperia'' 86 (2017) 129–203.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1974, Derek de Solla Price concluded from gear settings and inscriptions on the mechanism's faces that it was made about 87 BC and lost only a few years later.&lt;ref name=price-74/&gt; [[Jacques Cousteau]] and associates visited the wreck in 1976 and recovered coins dated between 76 and 67 BC.&lt;ref name=lazos-94/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/history/people/jacques-yves-cousteau|title=Jacques-Yves Cousteau – Antikythera Mechanism Research Project|website=www.antikythera-mechanism.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism's advanced state of corrosion has made it impossible to perform an accurate [[Metallurgical assay|compositional analysis]], but it is believed that the device was made of a low-tin [[bronze]] alloy (of approximately 95% copper, 5% tin).&lt;ref name=amrp-07/&gt; Its instructions were composed in [[Koine Greek]].&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

In 2008, continued research by the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project suggested that the concept for the mechanism may have originated in the colonies of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], since they identified the calendar on the [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] Spiral as coming from Corinth or one of its colonies in Northwest Greece or Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Freeth, Tony; Jones, Alexander; Steele, John M.; Bitsakis, Yanis (31 July 2008). "Calendars with Olympiad display and eclipse prediction on the Antikythera Mechanism"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was a colony of Corinth and the home of [[Archimedes]], and the Antikythera Mechanism Research project argued in 2008 that it might imply a connection with the school of Archimedes.&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt; However, it has recently been demonstrated that the calendar on the Metonic Spiral is indeed of the Corinthian type but cannot be that of Syracuse.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars", ''Hesperia'' 86 (2017): 134–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory suggests that coins found by Jacques Cousteau at the wreck site in the 1970s date to the time of the device's construction, and posits that its origin may have been from the ancient Greek city of [[Pergamon]],&lt;ref name="Freeth_SA" /&gt; home of the [[Library of Pergamum]]. With its many scrolls of art and science, it was second in importance only to the [[Library of Alexandria]] during the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref&gt;Article "Pergamum", ''Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'', 6th Edition, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship carrying the device also contained vases in the [[Rhodes|Rhodian]] style, leading to a hypothesis that it was constructed at an academy founded by [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Posidonius]] on that Greek island.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Derek de Solla (1974). "Gears from the Greeks. The Antikythera Mechanism: A Calendar Computer from ca. 80 B.C.". Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series. 64 (7): 13; 57–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes was a busy trading port in antiquity and a centre of astronomy and mechanical engineering, home to astronomer [[Hipparchus]] who was active from about 140 BC to 120 BC. The mechanism uses Hipparchus's theory for the motion of the moon, which suggests the possibility that he may have designed it or at least worked on it.&lt;ref name=marchant-06/&gt; In addition, it has recently been argued that the astronomical events on the [[Parapegma]] of the Antikythera Mechanism work best for latitudes in the range of 33.3–37.0 degrees north;&lt;ref&gt;Yannis Bitsakis and Alexander Jones, "The Inscriptions of the Antikythera Mechanism 3: The Front Dial and Parapegma Inscriptions", ''Almagest'' 7 (2016), pp. 117–119. See also Magdalini Anastasiou et al., "The Astronomical Events of the Parapegma of the Antikythera Mechanism", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'' 44 (2013): 173–186.&lt;/ref&gt; the island of Rhodes is located between the latitudes of 35.85 and 36.50 degrees north.

In 2014, a study by Carman and Evans argued for a new dating of approximately 200 BC based on identifying the start-up date on the [[Saros Dial]] as the astronomical lunar month that began shortly after the new moon of 28 April 205 BC.&lt;ref name="Carman Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141124-JM"/&gt; Moreover, according to Carman and Evans, the Babylonian arithmetic style of prediction fits much better with the device's predictive models than the traditional Greek trigonometric style.&lt;ref name="Carman Evans" /&gt; A study by Paul Iversen published in 2017 reasons that the prototype for the device was indeed from Rhodes, but that this particular model was modified for a client from Epirus in northwestern Greece, and was probably constructed within a generation of the shipwreck.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars", ''Hesperia'' 86 (2017) 129–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further dives were undertaken in 2014, with plans to continue in 2015, in the hope of discovering more of the mechanism.&lt;ref name=NYT-20141124-JM /&gt;

==Description==
The original mechanism apparently came out of the Mediterranean as a single encrusted piece. Soon afterward it fractured into three major pieces. Other small pieces have broken off in the interim from cleaning and handling,&lt;ref name=marchant-06-01&gt;{{cite book| first=Jo| last=Marchant| title=Decoding the Heavens| publisher=Da Capo Press| date=2006| page=180}} mechanical engineer and former curator of London's [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] [[Michael Wright (engineer)|Michael Wright]] tells of a piece breaking off in his inspection, which was glued back into place by the museum staff.&lt;/ref&gt; and still others were found on the sea floor by the Cousteau expedition. Other fragments may still be in storage, undiscovered since their initial recovery; Fragment F came to light in that way in 2005. Of the 82 known fragments, seven are mechanically significant and contain the majority of the mechanism and inscriptions. There are also 16 smaller parts that contain fractional and incomplete inscriptions.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=wright-07/&gt;

!Notes
|- align=center
| A ||180&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;150 ||369.1 ||27 ||Yes
| style="text-align:left" | The main fragment contains the majority of the known mechanism. Clearly visible on the front is the large b1 gear, and under closer inspection further gears behind said gear (parts of the l, m, c, and d trains are clearly visible as gears to the naked eye). The crank mechanism socket and the side-mounted gear that meshes with b1 is on ''Fragment A''. The back of the fragment contains the rearmost e and k gears for synthesis of the moon anomaly, noticeable also is the pin and slot mechanism of the k train. It is noticed from detailed scans of the fragment that all gears are very closely packed and have sustained damage and displacement due to their years in the sea. The fragment is approximately 30&amp;nbsp;mm thick at its thickest point.

Fragment A also contains divisions of the upper left quarter of the Saros spiral and 14 inscriptions from said spiral. The fragment also contains inscriptions for the Exeligmos dial and visible on the back surface the remnants of the dial face. Finally, this fragment contains some back door inscriptions.
|- align=center
| B ||125&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;60 ||99.4 ||1 ||Yes
| style="text-align:left" |  Contains approximately the bottom right third of the Metonic spiral and inscriptions of both the spiral and back door of the mechanism. The Metonic scale would have consisted of 235 cells of which 49 have been deciphered from fragment B either in whole or partially. The rest so far are assumed from knowledge of the [[Metonic cycle]]. This fragment also contains a single gear (o1) used in the Olympic train.
|- align=center
| C ||120&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;110 ||63.8 ||1 ||Yes
| style="text-align:left" |  Contains parts of the upper right of the front dial face showing calendar and zodiac inscriptions. This fragment also contains the moon indicator dial assembly including the moon phase sphere in its housing and a single bevel gear (ma1) used in the moon phase indication system.
|- align=center
| D ||45&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;35 ||15.0 ||1 ||
| style="text-align:left" |  Contains at least one unknown gear and according to [[Michael T. Wright]] possibly two. Their purpose and position has not been ascertained to any accuracy or consensus, but lends to the debate for the possible planet displays on the face of the mechanism.

===Minor fragments===
Many of the smaller fragments that have been found contain nothing of apparent value; however, a few have some inscriptions on them. Fragment 19 contains significant back door inscriptions including one reading "...&amp;nbsp;76 years&amp;nbsp;..." which refers to the [[Callippic cycle]]. Other inscriptions seem to describe the function of the back dials. In addition to this important minor fragment, 15 further minor fragments have remnants of inscriptions on them.&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|7}}

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Antikythera mechanism.svg|thumb|right|Schematic of the arte&lt;!-- 'e' - this article uses British spelling --&gt;fact's known mechanism]]

Information on the specific data gleaned from the ruins by the latest inquiries is detailed in the supplement to Freeth's 2006 ''Nature'' article.&lt;ref name="freeth-06" /&gt;

===Operation===
On the front face of the mechanism there is a fixed ring dial representing the [[ecliptic]], the twelve [[zodiac]]al signs marked off with equal 30 degree sectors. This matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the [[constellation]] boundaries were variable. Outside of that dial is another ring which is rotatable, marked off with the months and days of the Sothic [[Egyptian calendar]], twelve months of 30 days plus five [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary days]]. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the [[Greek alphabet]]. The first task, then, is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The mechanism was operated by turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via a [[crown gear]] to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible on the front of fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian [[ephemeris]] tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], the [[Lunar phase|moon phase]], [[eclipse]], and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System#Planets|planets]].&lt;ref name=freeth-09/&gt;

The operator also had to be aware of the position of the spiral dial pointers on the two large dials on the back. The pointer had a "follower" that tracked the spiral incisions in the metal as the dials incorporated four and five full rotations of the pointers. When a pointer reached the terminal month location at either end of the spiral, the pointer's follower had to be manually moved to the other end of the spiral before proceeding further.&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Faces===
[[File:Computer graphic for front of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated front panel of the Freeth model]]

====Front face====
The front dial has two concentric circular scales that represent the path of the [[ecliptic]] through the heavens. The outer ring is marked off with the days of the 365-day [[Egyptian civil calendar]]. On the inner ring, a second dial marks the Greek signs of the [[Zodiac]], with division into degrees. The mechanism predates the [[Julian calendar]] reform, but the [[Sothic cycle|Sothic]] and [[Callippic cycle]]s had already pointed to a {{frac|365|1|4}}-day solar year, as seen in [[Ptolemy III]]'s [[Decree of Canopus|abortive calendrical reform]] of 238{{nbsp}}BC. The dials are not believed to reflect his proposed [[leap day]] ([[Egyptian intercalary month|Epag.]] 6), but the outer calendar dial may be moved against the inner dial to compensate for the effect of the extra quarter day in the solar year by turning the scale backward one day every four years.

The position of the sun on the ecliptic corresponds to the current date in the year. The orbits of the moon and the five planets known to the Greeks are close enough to the ecliptic to make it a convenient reference for defining their positions as well.

The following three [[Egyptian calendar#Months|Egyptian months]] are inscribed in [[History of the Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] on the surviving pieces of the outer ring:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Jones |first=Alexander |title=A Portable Cosmos |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bl3ODQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT97 97] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bl3ODQAAQBAJ |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ΠΑΧΩΝ ([[Pachon]])
* ΠΑΥΝΙ ([[Payni]])
* ΕΠΙΦΙ ([[Epiphi]])

The other months have been reconstructed, although some reconstructions of the mechanism omit the 5 days of the Egyptian intercalary month. The [[Zodiac]] dial contains Greek inscriptions of the members of the zodiac, which is believed to be adapted to the [[tropical month]] version rather than the [[Sidereal month|sidereal]]:&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|8}}{{Failed verification|reason=This page mentions neither tropical nor sidereal|date=September 2016}}

Also on the zodiac dial are a number of single characters at specific points (see reconstruction here:&lt;ref name="isaw-1"/&gt;). They are keyed to a ''[[parapegma]]'', a precursor of the modern day [[almanac]] inscribed on the front face above and beneath the dials. They mark the locations of longitudes on the ecliptic for specific stars. The ''parapegma'' above the dials reads (square brackets indicate inferred text):

At least two pointers indicated positions of bodies upon the ecliptic. A lunar pointer indicated the position of the moon, and a mean sun pointer also was shown, perhaps doubling as the current date pointer. The moon position was not a simple mean moon indicator that would indicate movement uniformly around a circular orbit; it approximated the acceleration and deceleration of the moon's elliptical orbit, through the earliest extant use of [[epicyclic gearing]].

It also tracked the precession of the elliptical orbit around the ecliptic in an 8.88 year cycle. The mean sun position is, by definition, the current date. It is speculated that since such pains were taken to get the position of the moon correct,&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|20, 24}} then there also was likely to have been a "true sun" pointer in addition to the mean sun pointer likewise, to track the elliptical anomaly of the sun (the orbit of Earth around the sun), but there is no evidence of it among the ruins of the mechanism found to date.&lt;ref name=freeth-12 /&gt; Similarly, neither is there the evidence of planetary orbit pointers for the five planets known to the Greeks among the ruins. See [[#Proposed planet indication gearing schemes|Proposed planet indication gearing schemes]] below.

Finally, mechanical engineer Michael Wright has demonstrated that there was a mechanism to supply the lunar phase in addition to the position.&lt;ref name=wright-05 /&gt; The indicator was a small ball embedded in the lunar pointer, half-white and half-black, which rotated to show the phase (new, first quarter, half, third quarter, full, and back) graphically. The data to support this function is available given the sun and moon positions as angular rotations; essentially, it is the angle between the two, translated into the rotation of the ball. It requires a [[differential (mechanical device)|differential gear]], a gearing arrangement that sums or differences two angular inputs.

====Rear face====
[[File:Computer graphic for back of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated back panel]]
In July 2008, scientists reported new findings in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' showing that the mechanism not only tracked the [[Metonic calendar]] and predicted [[solar eclipses]], but also calculated the timing of several panhellenic athletic games, including the [[Ancient Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt; Inscriptions on the instrument closely match the names of the months that are used on calendars from [[Epirus]] in northwestern Greece and with the island of [[Corfu]], which in antiquity was known as Corcyra.&lt;ref name=wilford-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=connor-08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 148-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back of the mechanism, there are five dials: the two large displays, the [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] and the [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]], and three smaller indicators, the so-called Olympiad Dial,&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt; which has recently been renamed the Games dial as it did not track Olympiad years (the four-year cycle it tracks most closely is the Halieiad),&lt;ref name="Paul Iversen 2017"/&gt; the [[Callippic cycle|Callippic]], and the [[Exeligmos]].&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;{{rp|11}}

The Metonic Dial is the main upper dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Metonic cycle, defined in several physical units, is 235 [[month#Synodic month|synodic months]], which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in 5 rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on the pointer that keeps track of the layer of the spiral. The pointer points to the synodic month, counted from new moon to new moon, and the cell contains the [[Hellenic calendars#Corinthian|Corinthian month names]].&lt;ref name=freeth-08 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freeth | first1 = T | year = 2009 | title = Decoding an Ancient Computer | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 301 | issue = 6| pages = 76–83 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1209-76 | pmid=20058643|bibcode = 2009SciAm.301f..76F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 148-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, setting the correct solar time (in days) on the front panel indicates the current lunar month on the back panel, with resolution to within a week or so.

Based on the fact that the calendar month names are consistent with all the evidence of the Epirote calendar and that the Games dial mentions the very minor Naa games of Dodona (in Epirus), it has recently been argued that the calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism is likely to be the Epirote calendar, and that this calendar was probably adopted from a Corinthian colony in Epirus, possibly Ambracia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It has also been argued that the first month of the calendar, Phoinikaios, was ideally the month in which the autumn equinox fell, and that the start-up date of the calendar began shortly after the astronomical new moon of 23 August 205 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 165-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Callippic dial is the left secondary upper dial, which follows a 76-year cycle. The [[Callippic cycle]] is four Metonic cycles, and so this dial indicates the current Metonic cycle in the overall Callippic cycle.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Games dial is the right secondary upper dial; it is the only pointer on the instrument that travels in a counter-clockwise direction as time advances. The dial is divided into four sectors, each of which is inscribed with a year indicator and the name of two [[Panhellenic Games]]: the "crown" games of [[Isthmian Games|Isthmia]], [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympia]], [[Nemean Games|Nemea]], and [[Pythian Games|Pythia]]; and two lesser games: Naa (held at [[Dodona]]),&lt;ref name=bbc-08/&gt; and the sixth and final set of Games recently deciphered as the Halieia of Rhodes.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 141-147.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions on each one of the four divisions are:&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;

The Saros dial is the main lower spiral dial on the rear of the mechanism.&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;{{rp|4–5, 10}} The [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]] cycle is 18 years and {{frac|11|1|3}} days long (6585.333… days), which is very close to 223 synodic months (6585.3211 days). It is defined as the cycle of repetition of the positions required to cause solar and lunar eclipses, and therefore, it could be used to predict them&amp;nbsp;— not only the month, but the day and time of day. Note that the cycle is approximately 8 hours longer than an integer number of days. Translated into global spin, that means an eclipse occurs not only eight hours later, but one-third of a rotation farther to the west. Glyphs in 51 of the 223 synodic month cells of the dial specify the occurrence of 38 lunar and 27 solar eclipses. Some of the abbreviations in the glyphs read:
* Σ = ΣΕΛΗΝΗ (Moon)
* Η = ΗΛΙΟΣ (Sun)
* H\M = ΗΜΕΡΑΣ (of the day)
* ω\ρ = ωρα (hour)
* N\Y = ΝΥΚΤΟΣ (of the night)

The glyphs show whether the designated eclipse is solar or lunar, and give the day of the month and hour; obviously, solar eclipses may not be visible at any given point, and lunar eclipses are visible only if the moon is above the horizon at the appointed hour.&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|6}} In addition, the inner lines at the cardinal points of the Saros dial indicate the start of a new [[full moon cycle]]. Based on the distribution of the times of the eclipses, it has recently been argued that the start-up date of the Saros dial was shortly after the astronomical new moon of 28 April 205 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Carman, Christián C.; Evans, James (15 November 2014). "On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor". Archive for History of Exact Sciences. 68 (6): 693–774.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exeligmos Dial is the secondary lower dial on the rear of the mechanism. The [[Exeligmos]] cycle is a 54-year triple Saros cycle that is 19,756 days long. Since the length of the Saros cycle is to a third of a day (eight hours), so a full Exeligmos cycle returns counting to integer days, hence the inscriptions. The labels on its three divisions are:&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;{{rp|10}}
* Blank or o ? (representing the number zero, assumed, not yet observed)
* H (number 8) means add 8 hours to the time mentioned in the display
* Iϛ (number 16) means add 16 hours to the time mentioned in the display

Thus the dial pointer indicates how many hours must be added to the glyph times of the Saros dial in order to calculate the exact eclipse times.

===Doors===
The mechanism has a wooden casing with a front and a back door, both containing inscriptions.&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1/&gt; The back door appears to be the "instruction manual". On one of its fragments is written "76 years, 19 years" representing the [[Callippic]] and [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] cycles. Also written is "223" for the Saros cycle. On another one of its fragments, it is written "on the spiral subdivisions 235" referring to the Metonic dial.

===Gearing===
The mechanism is remarkable for the level of miniaturisation and the complexity of its parts, which is comparable to that of fourteenth-century astronomical clocks. It has at least 30 gears, although mechanism expert Michael Wright has suggested that the Greeks of this period were capable of implementing a system with many more gears.&lt;ref name=freeth-09/&gt;

There is much debate as to whether the mechanism had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient Greeks. No gearing for such a planetary display survives and all gears are accounted for—with the exception of one 63-toothed gear (r1) otherwise unaccounted for in fragment D.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The purpose of the front face was to position astronomical bodies with respect to the [[celestial sphere]] along the [[ecliptic]], in reference to the observer's position on the Earth. That is irrelevant to the question of whether that position was computed using a heliocentric or geocentric view of the solar system; either computational method should, and does, result in the same position (ignoring ellipticity), within the error factors of the mechanism.

Ptolemy's epicyclic solar system (still 300 years in the future from the apparent date of the mechanism), carried forward with more epicycles, was more accurate predicting the positions of planets than the view of Copernicus, until Kepler introduced the possibility that orbits are ellipses.&lt;ref name=amrp-07-2/&gt;

Evans et al. suggest that to display the mean positions of the five [[classical planets]] would require only 17 further gears that could be positioned in front of the large driving gear and indicated using individual circular dials on the face.&lt;ref name=cte-10/&gt;

Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones have modelled and published details of a version using several gear trains mechanically-similar to the lunar anomaly system allowing for indication of the positions of the planets as well as synthesis of the sun anomaly. Their system, they claim, is more authentic than Wright's model as it uses the known skill sets of the Greeks of that period and does not add excessive complexity or internal stresses to the machine.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The gear teeth were in the form of [[equilateral triangle]]s with an average circular pitch of 1.6&amp;nbsp;mm, an average wheel thickness of 1.4&amp;nbsp;mm and an average air gap between gears of 1.2&amp;nbsp;mm. The teeth probably were created from a blank bronze round using hand tools; this is evident because not all of them are even.&lt;ref name="freeth-12"/&gt; Due to advances in imaging and [[X-ray computed tomography|X-ray]] technology it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments. Thus the basic operation of the device is no longer a mystery and has been replicated accurately. The major unknown remains the question of the presence and nature of any planet indicators.&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|8}}

A table of the gears, their teeth, and the expected and computed rotations of various important gears follows. The gear functions come from Freeth et al. (2008)&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt; and those for the lower half of the table from Freeth and Jones 2012.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt; The computed values start with 1 year/revolution for the b1 gear, and the remainder are computed directly from gear teeth ratios. The gears marked with an asterisk (*) are missing, or have predecessors missing, from the known mechanism; these gears have been calculated with reasonable gear teeth counts.&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1/&gt;

There are several gear ratios for each planet that result in close matches to the correct values for synodic periods of the planets and the sun. The ones chosen above seem to provide good accuracy with reasonable tooth counts, but the specific gears that may have been used are, and probably will remain, unknown.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

It is very probable that there were planetary dials, as the complicated motions and periodicities of all planets are mentioned in the manual of the mechanism. The exact position and mechanisms for the gears of the planets is not known. There is no coaxial system but only for the moon. Fragment D that is an epicycloidal system is considered as a planetary gear for Jupiter (Moussas, 2011, 2012, 2014) or a gear for the motion of the Sun (University of Thessaloniki group).
'''The Sun gear''' is operated from the hand-operated crank (connected to gear a1, driving the large four-spoked mean sun gear, b1) and in turn drives the rest of the gear sets. The sun gear is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there may have been a second, "true sun" pointer that displayed the sun's elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume the input rotation of the b1 gear of 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed solely on the basis of the gear ratios of the gears named.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The Moon train''' starts with gear b1 and proceeds through c1, c2, d1, d2, e2, e5, k1, k2, e6, e1, and b3 to the moon pointer on the front face. The gears k1 and k2 form an [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic gear system]]; they are an identical pair of gears that don't mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted into a slot in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must move back and forth in the slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster in some parts of the rotation than others.  Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the moon, in consequence of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Position as a function of time|Kepler's second and third laws]]. The modelled rotational period of the moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. As mentioned, the pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year's time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the [[moon]] of 8.85 years.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

The system also models the [[lunar phase|phases of the moon]]. The moon pointer holds a shaft along its length, on which is mounted a small gear named r, which meshes to the sun pointer at B0 (the connection between B0 and the rest of B is not visible in the original mechanism, so whether b0 is the current date/mean sun pointer or a hypothetical true sun pointer is not known). The gear rides around the dial with the moon, but is also geared to the sun&amp;nbsp;— the effect is to perform a [[differential gear]] operation, so the gear turns at the synodic month period, measuring in effect, the angle of the difference between the sun and moon pointers.  The gear drives a small ball that appears through an opening in the moon pointer's face, painted longitudinally half white and half black, displaying the phases pictorially. It turns with a modelled rotational period of 29.53 days; the modern value for the synodic month is 29.530589 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] train''' is driven by the drive train b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, and n1, which is connected to the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the pointer is the length of the 6939.5 days (over the whole five-rotation spiral), while the modern value for the Metonic cycle is 6939.69 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The [[Olympiad]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n2, and o1, which mounts the pointer.  It has a computed modelled rotational period of exactly 4 years, as expected. Incidentally, it is the only pointer on the mechanism that rotates counter-clockwise; all of the others rotate clockwise.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The [[Callippic cycle|Callippic]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n3, p1, p2, and q1, which mounts the pointer. It has a computed modelled rotational period of 27758 days, while the modern value is 27758.8 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, and g1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Saros pointer is 1646.3 days (in four rotations along the spiral pointer track); the modern value is 1646.33 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The [[Exeligmos]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, g1, g2, h1, h2, and i1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Exeligmos pointer is 19,756 days; the modern value is 19755.96 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

Apparently, gears m3, n1-3, p1-2, and q1 did not survive in the wreckage. The functions of the pointers were deduced from the remains of the dials on the back face, and reasonable, appropriate gearage to fulfill the functions was proposed, and is generally accepted.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

====Proposed gear schemes====
Because of the large space between the mean sun gear and the front of the case and the size of and mechanical features on the mean sun gear it is very likely that the mechanism contained further gearing that either has been lost in or subsequent to the shipwreck or was removed before being loaded onto the ship.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt; This lack of evidence and nature of the front part of the mechanism has led to numerous attempts to emulate what the Greeks of the period would have done and, of course, because of the lack of evidence many solutions have been put forward.

'''Michael Wright''' was the first person to design and build a model with not only the known mechanism, but also, with his emulation of a potential [[planetarium]] system. He suggested that along with the lunar anomaly, adjustments would have been made for the deeper, more basic solar anomaly (known as the "first anomaly"). He included pointers for this "true sun", Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, in addition to the known "mean sun" (current time) and lunar pointers.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

'''Evans, Carman, and Thorndike''' published a solution with significant differences from Wright's.&lt;ref name=cte-10/&gt; Their proposal centred on what they observed as irregular spacing of the inscriptions on the front dial face, which to them seemed to indicate an off-centre sun indicator arrangement; this would simplify the mechanism by removing the need to simulate the solar anomaly. They also suggested that rather than accurate planetary indication (rendered impossible by the offset inscriptions) there would be simple dials for each individual planet showing information such as key events in the cycle of planet, initial and final appearances in the night sky, and apparent direction changes. This system would lead to a much simplified gear system, with much reduced forces and complexity, as compared to Wright's model.&lt;ref name=cte-10/&gt;

Their proposal used simple meshed gear trains and accounted for the previously unexplained 63 toothed gear in fragment D. They proposed two face plate layouts, one with evenly spaced dials, and another with a gap in the top of the face to account for criticism regarding their not using the apparent fixtures on the b1 gear. They proposed that rather than bearings and pillars for gears and axles, they simply held weather and seasonal icons to be displayed through a window.&lt;ref name=cte-10/&gt;

In a paper published in 2012 Carman, Thorndike, and Evans also proposed a system of epicyclic gearing with pin and slot followers.&lt;ref name=cte-12/&gt;

'''Freeth and Jones''' published their proposal in 2012 after extensive research and work. They came up with a compact and feasible solution to the question of planetary indication. They also propose indicating the solar anomaly (that is, the sun's apparent position in the zodiac dial) on a separate pointer from the date pointer, which indicates the mean position of the sun, as well as the date on the month dial. If the two dials are synchronised correctly, their front panel display is essentially the same as Wright's. Unlike Wright's model however, this model has not been built physically, and is only a 3-D computer model.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

[[Image:Gearing Relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism.svg|thumb|upright|Internal gearing relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism, based on the Freeth and Jones proposal]]

The system to synthesise the solar anomaly is very similar to that used in Wright's proposal. Three gears, one fixed in the centre of the b1 gear and attached to the sun spindle, the second fixed on one of the spokes (in their proposal the one on the bottom left) acting as an idle gear, and the final positioned next to that one, the final gear is fitted with an offset pin and, over said pin, an arm with a slot that in turn, is attached to the sun spindle, inducing anomaly as the mean sun wheel turns.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The inferior planet mechanism includes the sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt; For each of the three systems there is an epicyclic gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the sun and all the planets—excepting only the moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the gear's centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, out in front of the front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each. Five gears and three slotted bars in all.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The superior planet systems—Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—all follow the same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt; Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.

In total, there are eight coaxial spindles of various nested sizes to transfer the rotations in the mechanism to the eight pointers. So in all, there are 30 original gears, 7 gears added to complete calendar functionality, 17 gears and three slotted bars to support the six new pointers, for a grand total of 54 gears, three bars, and eight pointers in Freeth and Jones' design.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

On the visual representation Freeth supplies in the paper, the pointers on the front zodiac dial have small, round identifying stones. He mentions a quote from an ancient papyrus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...a voice comes to you speaking. Let the stars be set upon the board in accordance with [their] nature except for the Sun and Moon. And let the Sun be golden, the Moon silver, Kronos [Saturn] of obsidian, Ares [Mars] of reddish onyx, Aphrodite [Venus] lapis lazuli veined with gold, Hermes [Mercury] turquoise; let Zeus [Jupiter] be of (whitish?) stone, crystalline (?)...&lt;ref name=papyrus/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Accuracy===
Investigations by Freeth and Jones reveal that their simulated mechanism is not particularly accurate, the Mars pointer being up to 38° off at times. This is not due to inaccuracies in gearing ratios in the mechanism, but rather to inadequacies in the Greek theory. The accuracy could not have been improved until first Ptolemy put forth his [[Almagest|Planetary Hypotheses]] in the second half of the second century AD and then the introduction of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Kepler's Second Law]] in the early 17th century.&lt;ref name=freeth-12 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, the Antikythera Mechanism was a machine designed to predict celestial phenomena according to the sophisticated astronomical theories current in its day, the sole witness to a lost history of brilliant engineering, a conception of pure genius, one of the great wonders of the ancient world—but it didn’t really work very well!&lt;ref name=freeth-12 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to theoretical accuracy, there is the matter of mechanical accuracy. Freeth and Jones note that the inevitable "looseness" in the mechanism due to the hand-built gears, with their triangular teeth and the frictions between gears, and in bearing surfaces, probably would have swamped the finer solar and lunar correction mechanisms built into it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though the engineering was remarkable for its era, recent research indicates that its design conception exceeded the engineering precision of its manufacture by a wide margin—with considerable cumulative inaccuracies in the gear trains, which would have cancelled out many of the subtle anomalies built into its design.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/46026/|title=An Initial Assessment of the Accuracy of the Gear Trains in the Antikythera Mechanism|last=Geoffrey|first=Edmunds, Michael|date=1 August 2011|website=orca.cf.ac.uk|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the device itself may have struggled with inaccuracies due to the triangular teeth being hand made, the calculations used and the technology implemented to create the elliptical paths of the planets and retrograde motion of the moon and Mars by using a clockwork-type gear train with the addition of a pin-and-slot mechanism predated that of the first known clocks found in [[Late antiquity|antiquity]] in Medieval Europe by more than 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchant|first1=Jo|title=Decoding the Heavens|date=2009|publisher=First Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81742-7|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes' development of the approximate value of pi and his theory of centres of gravity along with the steps he made towards developing the calculus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Netz &amp; Noel|first1=Reviel &amp; William|title=The Archimedes Codex|date=2007|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81580-5|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; all suggest that the Greeks had access to more than enough mathematical knowledge beyond that of just Babylonian algebra in order to be able to model the elliptical nature of planetary motion.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of special delight to physicists, the Moon mechanism uses a special train of bronze gears, two of them linked with a slightly offset axis, to indicate the position and phase of the moon. As is known today from [[Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion]], the moon travels at different speeds as it orbits the Earth, and this speed differential is modeled by the Antikythera Mechanism, even though the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] were not aware of the actual elliptical shape of the orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickover|first1=Clifford|title=The Physics Book|date=2011|publisher=Sterling|isbn=978-1-4027-7861-2|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Similar devices in ancient literature==

[[Cicero]]'s ''[[De re publica]]'', a 1st-century BC philosophical dialogue, mentions two machines that some modern authors consider as some kind of [[planetarium]] or [[orrery]], predicting the movements of the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], and the five planets known at that time. They were both built by [[Archimedes]] and brought to Rome by the Roman general [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] after the death of Archimedes at the [[Siege of Syracuse (214–212 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in 212 BC. Marcellus had great respect for Archimedes and one of these machines was the only item he kept from the siege (the second was offered to the temple of Virtus). The device was kept as a family heirloom, and Cicero has Philus (one of the participants in a conversation that Cicero imagined had taken place in a villa belonging to [[Scipio Aemilianus]] in the year 129 BC) saying that [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] (consul with [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 166 BC)|Marcellus's nephew]] in 166 BC, and credited by [[Pliny the Elder]] as the first Roman to have written a book explaining solar and lunar eclipses) gave both a "learned explanation" and a working demonstration of the device.

{{quote|I had often heard this celestial globe or sphere mentioned on account of the great fame of Archimedes. Its appearance, however, did not seem to me particularly striking. There is another, more elegant in form, and more generally known, moulded by the same Archimedes, and deposited by the same Marcellus, in the Temple of Virtue at Rome. But as soon as Gallus had begun to explain, by his sublime science, the composition of this machine, I felt that the Sicilian geometrician must have possessed a genius superior to any thing we usually conceive to belong to our nature. Gallus assured us, that the solid and compact globe, was a very ancient invention, and that the first model of it had been presented by [[Thales of Miletus]]. That afterwards [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], a disciple of [[Plato]], had traced on its surface the stars that appear in the sky, and that many years subsequent, borrowing from Eudoxus this beautiful design and representation, Aratus had illustrated them in his verses, not by any science of astronomy, but the ornament of poetic description. He added, that the figure of the sphere, which displayed the motions of the Sun and Moon, and the five planets, or wandering stars, could not be represented by the primitive solid globe. And that in this, the invention of Archimedes was admirable, because he had calculated how a single revolution should maintain unequal and diversified progressions in dissimilar motions.

When Gallus moved this globe it showed the relationship of the Moon with the Sun, and there were exactly the same number of turns on the bronze device as the number of days in the real globe of the sky. Thus it showed the same eclipse of the Sun as in the globe [of the sky], as well as showing the Moon entering the area of the Earth's shadow when the Sun is in line&amp;nbsp;... [missing text] [i.e. It showed both solar and lunar eclipses.]&lt;ref name=cicero/&gt;}}

[[Pappus of Alexandria]] stated that Archimedes had written a now lost manuscript on the construction of these devices entitled ''On Sphere-Making''.&lt;ref name=rorres-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=fildes-10/&gt; The surviving texts from the [[Library of Alexandria]] describe many of his creations, some even containing simple drawings. One such device is his [[odometer]], the exact model later used by the Romans to place their [[mile marker]]s (described by [[Vitruvius]], [[Heron of Alexandria]] and in the time of Emperor [[Commodus]]).&lt;ref name=needham/&gt; The drawings in the text appeared functional, but attempts to build them as pictured had failed. When the gears pictured, which had square teeth, were replaced with gears of the type in the Antikythera mechanism, which were angled, the device was perfectly functional.&lt;ref name=sleeswyk-81/&gt; Whether this is an example of a device created by Archimedes and described by texts lost in the burning of the [[Library of Alexandria]], or if it is a device based on his discoveries, or if it has anything to do with him at all, is debatable.

If Cicero's account is correct, then this technology existed as early as the 3rd century BC. Archimedes' device is also mentioned by later Roman era writers such as [[Lactantius]] (''Divinarum Institutionum Libri VII''), [[Claudian]] (''In sphaeram Archimedes''), and [[Proclus]] (''Commentary on the first book of Euclid's Elements of Geometry'') in the 4th and 5th centuries.

Cicero also said that another such device was built "recently" by his friend [[Posidonius]], "... each one of the revolutions of which brings about the same movement in the Sun and Moon and five wandering stars [planets] as is brought about each day and night in the heavens&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=cicero-1/&gt;

It is unlikely that any one of these machines was the Antikythera mechanism found in the shipwreck since both the devices fabricated by Archimedes and mentioned by Cicero were located in Rome at least 30 years later than the estimated date of the shipwreck, and the third device was almost certainly in the hands of Posidonius by that date. The scientists who have reconstructed the Antikythera mechanism also agree that it was too sophisticated to have been a unique device.

This evidence that the Antikythera mechanism was not unique adds support to the idea that there was an ancient Greek tradition of complex mechanical technology that was later, at least in part, transmitted to the Byzantine and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]]s, where mechanical devices which were complex, albeit simpler than the Antikythera mechanism, were built during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=charette-06/&gt; Fragments of a geared calendar attached to a sundial, from the 5th or 6th century [[Byzantine Empire]], have been found; the calendar may have been used to assist in telling time.&lt;ref name=madison-85/&gt; In the Islamic world, [[Banū Mūsā]]'s ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices|Kitab al-Hiyal]]'', or ''Book of Ingenious Devices'', was commissioned by the [[Caliph of Baghdad]] in the early 9th century AD. This text described over a hundred mechanical devices, some of which may date back to ancient Greek texts preserved in [[Monastery|monasteries]]. A geared calendar similar to the Byzantine device was described by the scientist [[al-Biruni]] around 1000, and a surviving 13th-century [[astrolabe]] also contains a similar clockwork device.&lt;ref name=madison-85/&gt; It is possible that this medieval technology may have been transmitted to Europe and contributed to the development of mechanical clocks there.&lt;ref name=marchant-06/&gt;

'''Arnold Ipolyi''' (family name originally Stummer) (20 October 1823 – 2 December 1886) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] bishop and historian.

==Life==
Ipolyi was born in [[Kosihy nad Ipľom|Ipolykeszi]], [[Hungary]] (currently ''Kosihy nad Ipľomin'', [[Slovakia]]). At the age of 13 he entered the ranks of the alumni of the Archdiocese of [[Esztergom]], studied two years in the [[Emericianum]] at [[Bratislava|Pozsony]] and later at [[Trnava|Nagyszombat]], and finished at the [[Pázmáneum]] at [[Vienna]], where he attended lectures on theology for four years. In 1844 he entered the seminary of Esztergom, took minor orders in 1845, and was ordained priest in 1847. From 1845 to 1847 he acted as tutor in the family of Baron [[Mednyánszky]], was then curate at [[Svätý Peter|Komáromszentpéter]] (''German: Komorn-Sankt-Peter''), in 1848 preacher at Bratislava, in 1849 spent a short time as tutor in the family of [[Count Palffy]], and became in this year parish priest of [[Zohor]]. Even before his ordination he concerned himself with historical and art-historical matters. In 1854 his ''Ungarische Mythologic'' came out, as the first-fruit of his work, in which he treats of the [[ancient religion of Hungary]]. Although the work won the prize offered by the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], the author afterwards withdrew it from the press, so that at the present time it is very rare. In 1860 Ipolyi became parish priest at [[Törökszentmiklós]]. Accompanied by [[Franz Kubinyi]] and [[Emerich Henszlmann]], he made in 1862 a journey to [[Constantinople]], where he discovered the remainder of the library of [[Matthias Corvinus]]. In 1863 he was made canon of [[Eger]], and in 1869 director of the [[Central Ecclesiastical Seminary]] at [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]; in 1871 he became Bishop of [[Banská Bystrica|Besztercebánya]], and Bishop of [[Oradea|Nagyvárad]] where he died on 2 December later that same year. Ipolyi was member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, as well as a member of different learned Societies at home and abroad. He was one of the founders and at first vice-president, then president of the [[Hungarian Historical Society]]. His literary activity extended into the provinces of history, art-history, archaeology, and Christian art. He enriched the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] with sixty valuable paintings. He bequeathed to Nagyvárad (today Oradea, Romania) in his will, for the purpose of founding a museum, his collections which had been brought together with a great expert knowledge of art.

Mazlish has been substantively involved in the major ongoing activity of the [[Arnold J. Toynbee#Toynbee Prize Foundation|Toynbee Foundation]], the New Global History Initiative, which organized several international conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toynbeeprize.org/global-history-network/conferences/|title=International Conferences on Global History|work=toynbeeprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since 2007 has published the [http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ngs ''New Global Studies Journal''] (a peer-reviewed electronic journal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toynbeeprize.org/new-global-studies-journal|title=New Global Studies Journal|work=toynbeeprize.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428155748/http://toynbeeprize.org/new-global-studies-journal/|archivedate=2014-04-28|df=}}/&lt;/ref&gt;  Mazlish is one of the editors, along with [[Nayan Chanda]] (Yale), [[Akira Iriye]] (Emeritus, Harvard), [[Saskia Sassen]] (Columbia), and Kenneth Weisbrode (Managing Editor).

Mazlish was also one of the founding members of the [[Robert Lifton#The Wellfleet Psychohistory Group|Wellfleet Psychohistory Group]].

In 2004, the journal [[Historically Speaking (journal)|''Historically Speaking'']], on the occasion of an interview with Mazlish, conducted by its editor, [[Donald A. Yerxa|Donald Yerxa]], described him as "identified with several seemingly disparate intellectual pursuits", including psychohistory, the history of the social sciences, and the new field of "global history", which he was then helping to shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/historic/hs/julyaugust04.html#mazlish|title=Historically Speaking: The Bulletin of the Historical Society, July/August 2004: Volume V, Number 6|work=bu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honors ==

Mazlish was elected a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1967.

From 1974 to 1979, Mazlish served as Head of MIT’s Department of Humanities (Course XXI). At the time, there were 11 “sections” representing their disciplines (this amounted to about 140 faculty), an unwieldy administrative structure. When he stepped down, he recommended that each section became an autonomous department; this occurred a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/shass/soundings/issue_00f/fea_lum_bm_00f.html|title=Soundings Fall 2000 (An Interview with Bruce Mazlish)|work=mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazlish's books have received several honors, including the Hudson Book Club Selection, Book Find Club Selection,&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt; and Kayden National Book Award (1994-1995, for his 1993 ''The Fourth Discontinuity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300065121|title=The Fourth Discontinuity - Mazlish, Bruce - Yale University Press|work=yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and family ==

Bruce Mazlish was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1923. His father, Louis Mazlish, had immigrated as a teenager from what was then Russia.  A largely self-taught engineer and entrepreneur, Louis Mazlish started a laundry service for which he developed much of the equipment. He married Lee Reuben in 1919, and had three children, of whom Bruce was the middle, with an older brother Robert and a younger sister, Elaine.

Bruce Mazlish attended local public primary schools in Brooklyn, and then elected to go to [[Boys High School (Brooklyn)|Boys High School]], which drew its students on a city-wide basis. Upon graduation he entered [[Columbia University]] in 1940.

Having enlisted in the Officer's Reserve Corps, Mazlish was called up in 1943, and underwent basic training in the US infantry. Subsequently he served in the [[Office of Strategic Services]], assigned to the Far East arena, in Morale Operations. When the war ended, Columbia granted him a catch-up BA dated 1944.

Mazlish worked as a journalist at [[The Washington Daily News]] (now defunct) for half of a year, spent a year with his wife in Mexico working on a novel, and then worked at a third-rate prep school, teaching English (for which he was qualified) and History (which he learned by reading one chapter ahead of his students). Teaching the latter gave him an original view of the discipline, and the [[G.I. Bill]] drove educational expansion and demand for teachers in the post-WWII years.

In this way, Mazlish stumbled onto the path of the academic world, teaching history for two years at the University of Maine, Brunswick campus, and then completing advanced degrees at Columbia University in literature (MA thesis: “Defoe: Criminologist,” 1947) and then a Ph.D in Modern European History, where he worked mainly under Professors Shepherd Clough and [[Jacques Barzun]] (thesis on “Burke, Bonald and De Maistre: A Study in Conservative Thought”, 1955)."&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;

Mazlish was married to [[Neva Goodwin]], economist and co-director of the [[Global Development And Environment Institute]] at [[Tufts University]], with whom he has published and edited several works. Previously, he was married to Constance Shaw (fellow OSS officer in WWII), and to Anne Austin. He had two children from his first marriage, Cordelia and Peter Shaw, and two from his second, Anthony and Jared. He passed on November 27, 2016 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was eulogized in the New York Times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vitello|first1=Paul|title=Bruce Mazlish, Who Fused Psychoanalysis and History in His Books, Dies at 93|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/books/bruce-mazlish-richard-nixon.html?emc=eta1&amp;_r=0|accessdate=1 December 2016|work=[[New York Times]]|date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by several at the Toynbee Prize Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1705">In [[genealogy]], a '''cadet''' is a younger [[son]], as opposed to the firstborn [[heir]]. Compare [[puisne]].

== Etymology ==
The word is recorded in [[English language|English]] since 1634, originally for a young son, identical to the [[French language|French]], which is itself derived from the [[Gascon dialect|Gascon]] [[Occitan]] (spoken in [[Gascony]] in southwest France) ''capdet'' "captain, chief", in turn from the [[Late Latin]] ''capitellum'', the diminutive of Latin ''caput'' "head" (hence also chief).

Younger sons from Gascon families apparently were commonly sent to the French court to serve as officers; as a rule non-heirs from the European nobility sought careers in the military or the clergy.

== Usage ==

As an adjective, "cadet" is used to signify a junior branch of a family. Thus, the [[House of Orléans|Orléans]] line was a ''[[cadet branch]]'' of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] family.

For the status as such, the noun [[cadency]] exists, as in the [[heraldry|heraldic]] term [[mark of cadency]] for a feature which distinguishes a cadet son's [[coat of arms]] from the father's which is passed on unaltered only to the (usually firstborn) heir.

Military has been the traditional career choice of the nobility throughout the centuries, and it has been customary that the firstborn son has inherited the title, lands and possessions, while the younger sons of a noble family went to the military, often to be trained as officers. Hence the meaning "[[cadet branch]]" for a junior branch of a family and the term "[[cadet]]" for an officer trainee.

[[File:Tag des offenen Denkmals 2006 09 10.jpg|thumb|right|''Tag des offenen Denkmals'' in the ''Höchster Schloß'', 2006]]
The '''''Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz''''' ("German Foundation for Monument Protection") is a German private initiative founded in 1985&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denkmalschutz.de/auftrag_stiftung.html Organisation website]&lt;/ref&gt; that works for the preservation of [[cultural heritage]] in Germany and to promote the idea of [[cultural heritage management]].
==Background==
Since 1900, when [[Georg Dehio]] published his ''Handbook of German Art Heritage'', Germany has not had a central list of [[National Heritage Site]]s. Each of the [[States of Germany|sixteen states]] keeps their own set of lists and many towns and cities keep their own lists, all based on varying criteria for inclusion.
==Monument protection==

[[File:Schloss Gondorf1.jpg|thumb|right|Compromise between conservation of a Heritage Site and economic needs such as a highway, [[Schloss Gondorf]], [[Kobern-Gondorf]], on the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]].]]
Denkmalschutz works to coordinate efforts, promote public awareness, and also to act as a central contact for worldwide organizations such as [[UNESCO World Heritage]]. They also organize and fund the [[European Heritage Days]] in Germany, which are called ''Tag des offenen Denkmals''. This "open monument day" has been held yearly with a different theme since 1993 on the second Sunday of September. For example, in 2011 on September 11th, the theme ''Romanticism, Realism, Revolution&amp;nbsp;- The 19th Century'' opened in [[Trier]]. 

Protecting heritage site homes with a listing in a regional ''Denkmalschutz'' list is not always appreciated by everyone, since such a listing may come with legal [[historic preservation]] obligations.  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/245100778/PROTECTED-BUILDINGS-AND-REDEVELOPMENT-AREAS-IN-GERMANY-AN-OWNERS-GUDE&lt;/ref&gt; Other protected sites such as [[cobblestone]] streets can be seen as a nuisance for cyclists and wheelchairs. Many sites are marked with a tag according to the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention]] of 1954 regarding the protection of cultural heritage in times of armed conflict.

'''Edvard Bull''' (4 December 1881 – 26 August 1932) was a Norwegian historian and politician for the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]]. He took the doctorate in 1912 and became a professor at the [[University of Oslo|University of Kristiania]] in 1917, and is known for writings on a broad range of subjects. In addition to his academic work, he is known for his work on ''[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]''. His [[Marxist]] leanings inspired him to take up a parallel political career, in the Labour Party. Situated on the radical wing in the 1910s, he was among the architects as the Labour Party denounced the [[Twenty-one Conditions]] in 1923 and reunited with the social democrats in 1927. He was the deputy party leader from 1923 to 1932, and served as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in [[cabinet Hornsrud|Hornsrud's short-lived cabinet]] in 1928.

==Personal life==
He was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] as the son of chief physician [[Edvard Isak Hambro Bull]] (1845–1925) and his wife Ida Marie Sofie Paludan (1861–1957). He was a brother of theatre director [[Johan Peter Bull]], literary professor [[Francis Bull]]&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2000|title=Edv Bull|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=|last=|volume=2|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Edv_Bull/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and genealogist [[Theodor Bull]]. He was also a nephew of military officer [[Karl Sigwald Johannes Bull]], grandnephew of [[Anders Sandøe Ørsted Bull]], great-grandson of [[Georg Jacob Bull]] and great-great-grandson of Chief Justice [[Johan Randulf Bull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Den trønderske slekten Bull|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|first=Terje|last=Bratberg|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Den_tr%C3%B8nderske_slekten_Bull|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1909 he married Lucie Juliane Antonette Voss (1886–1970). Their son [[Edvard Bull, Jr.]] became a notable historian.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Academic career==
Bull [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in 1899, and studied in [[classical philology]], [[geography]] and [[history]] at the [[University of Oslo|University of Kristiania]]. He graduated in 1906 with the [[cand.mag.]] degree&amp;mdash;by that time he had already published his first academic work. A study trip in Germany and France from 1906 to 1907 spurred his interest of medieval Catholicism. He planned on writing a larger work incorporating [[church history]]. He released the paper ''Bods- og skriftevæsenet i den norske kirke i middelalderen'' in 1909, and expanded upon this work to publish his doctoral thesis ''Folk og kirke i middelalderen. Studier til Norges historie'' in 1912. The work earned him the [[dr.philos.]] degree. He had been employed as a [[research fellow]] at the University of Kristiania since 1910, and became a lecturer in 1913. In 1917 he succeeded the deceased [[Ernst Sars]] as a professor.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Although he wrote several publications on miscellaneous European history, his main contribution was on Norwegian history. His main work in the field, volume two of ''Det norske folks liv og historie'', was published as late as 1931. The study of old agricultural societies also led him on a path of local history. In 1914 and 1918 he published the two-volume ''Akers historie'', on the history of [[Aker, Norway|Aker]], and two volumes of ''Kristianias historie'', on [[Oslo]], followed later. Bull was also known as a co-editor of the [[biographical dictionary]] ''[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]'',&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; the first volume of which was released by the publishing house [[Aschehoug]] in 1923. Bull was well-known at Aschehoug, having formerly contributed to its periodical ''[[Samtiden]]''. Long-time ''Samtiden'' editor [[Gerhard Gran]] was the second co-editor, the third was [[Anders Krogvig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2002|title=Anders Krogvig|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Sigurd Aa.|last=Aarnes|volume=5|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Anders_Krogvig/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the early deaths of Gran and Krogvig, [[Einar Jansen]] was brought in to assist Bull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2002|title=Einar Jansen|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Jon Gunnar|last=Arntzen|volume=5|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Einar_Jansen/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bull was also a consultant for the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] from 1914 to 1918.&lt;ref name=nsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/index.cfm?urlname=polsys&amp;lan=&amp;MenuItem=N1_1&amp;ChildItem=&amp;State=collapse&amp;UttakNr=33&amp;person=18020|title=Edvard Bull|publisher=Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1927 to 1932 he chaired the [[Norwegian Historical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hifo.b.uib.no/om-hifo/historikk/|title=Historikk|publisher=[[Norwegian Historical Association]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite influences from [[Karl Lamprecht]] and [[Werner Sombart]], Bull clearly drew most of his inspiration from [[Karl Marx]]' [[historical materialism]]. Publications in this vein include ''Karl Marx'' (1918) and ''Den russiske arbeider- og bonderevolution'' (1922). He also wrote purely political articles and pamphlets.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Political career==
While studying, Bull became acquainted with radical politicians like [[Emil Stang, Jr.]], [[Jacob Friis]] and [[Kyrre Grepp]]. He became active in the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] around 1915, and was a driving force behind the molding of the Labour Party into a [[revolutionary]] workers' party towards the end of the 1910s. He was known both as a party ideologist and speaker, editing the party magazine ''Det tyvende Aarhundrede'' from 1918 to 1920 and 1927 to 1928, but also as a day-to-day politician, serving on the school board of Kristiania from 1916 to 1925 and as a member of the city council from 1919 to 1925.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

In 1919, the Labour Party joined the [[Comintern|Third Communist International]]. Although the revolutionary wing had taken control of the party at the 1918 national convention, dissent soon surfaced. Moderates broke out to form the [[Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway]] in 1921. The main contention surrounded the possible adaption of the [[Twenty-one Conditions]], which was demanded by Comintern members. Bull was a staunch opponent of the Twenty-one Conditions, and following a resolution at the February 1923 national convention, the Labour Party left the Comintern.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; In the same year Bull was selected as deputy party leader, a position he held until his death.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; The Soviet-friendly [[Communist Party of Norway|Communist Party]] was then formed by splinters, while the road was open for a reconciliation with the Social Democratic Labour Party. Bull helped engineer the reunion between the two parties in 1927. In the same year, Labour became the largest party in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1927|general election]]. Bull was never elected to Parliament, but when Christopher Hornsrud formed the first ever [[cabinet Hornsrud|socialist cabinet]] in Norway, Bull was appointed as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; However, the cabinet only lasted from 28 January to 15 February, being defeated by the other parliamentary parties on a [[vote of no confidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/The-Government/previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/ministries-and-offices/Offices/prime-minister-since-1814/Christopher-Andersen-Hornsrud.html?id=463379|title=Christopher Hornsrud|publisher=[[Government.no]]|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was both preceded and succeeded by people who were also [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Ministers]]; [[Ivar Lykke (politician)|Ivar Lykke]] and [[Johan Ludwig Mowinckel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/The-Government/previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/ministries-and-offices/offices/minister-of-foreign-affairs-since-1905.html?id=426161|title=Norway's Minister of Foreign Affairs|publisher=[[Government.no]]|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This defeat pushed the Labour Party in a revolutionary direction once again. Bull was among the writers of the party manifesto for the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1930|1930 general election]], which was more radical. However, this tactic caused a significant loss in the election. Historians generally agree that from this point, the Labour Party decisively drifted away from the revolutionary rhetoric and policies.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; [[Ole Colbjørnsen]] emerged as the new party ideologist, writing ''En norsk treårsplan'' in 1933 together with [[Axel Sømme]], a program for turning Labour into a social democratic reform party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2000|title=Ole Colbjørnsen|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Reidar|last=Hirsti|authorlink=Reidar Hirsti|volume=2|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Ole_Colbj%C3%B8rnsen/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour politicians formed a [[cabinet Nygaardsvold|cabinet]] again in 1935, and more or less held power until 1965, except for the war years 1940 to 1945 when [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|Germany occupied Norway]] as well as a month in 1963, when a [[cabinet Lyng|right-winged cabinet]] held office.

==Death==
Bull, however, would not live to see any of this, as he died from a brain tumor in 1932. This meant that he did not release further volumes of ''Det norske folks liv og historie'', as he had planned. Volume three of ''Kristianias historie'' was underway, but was not finished. V. Sønstevold completed and published it in 1937.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

'''Elizabeth (Eliza) Parke Custis Law''' (August 21, 1776 – December 31, 1831)&lt;ref name="Richmond Enquirer, 3 Jan. 1832"&gt;"Obituary: Elizabeth Parke Custis Law", ''Richmond Enquirer'', 3 January 1832&lt;/ref&gt; was the eldest granddaughter of [[Martha Washington|Martha Dandridge Washington]] and step-grandchild of [[George Washington]]. She married [[Thomas Law (1756–1834)|Thomas Law]], the youngest son of the late bishop of Carlisle, England, and an experienced administrator with the [[East India Company]].

Elizabeth P. (Custis) Law became a social leader in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and she worked to preserve the Washington family heritage. She and Law separated in 1804 and divorced in 1811. They had one daughter who survived and three grandchildren.

Elizabeth's siblings included [[Martha Parke Custis Peter]] (1777–1854), [[Eleanor Parke Custis Lewis|Eleanor (Nelly) Parke Custis Lewis]] (1779–1852), and [[George Washington Parke Custis]] (1781–1857).

After the 1781 death of their father, the eldest two daughters (Elizabeth and Martha) continued to live with their mother at Abingdon. The two youngest children (Nelly and George) moved to [[Mount Vernon]] to live with George and Martha Washington.&lt;ref name=Kail/&gt;  In 1783, their widowed mother Eleanor Calvert Custis married Dr. [[David Stuart (Virginia politician)|David Stuart]] (1753–1814), an [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], physician and business associate of George Washington.&lt;ref name=Kail/&gt; Dr. Stuart and his wife remained at Abingdon for the first years of their marriage.&lt;ref name=Kail/&gt;

The Stuart family and the Washingtons remained very close.&lt;ref name=Kail/&gt;  In 1785, Dr. Stuart purchased an estate, [[Hope Park]], in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]] and moved the family there.&lt;ref name=Kail/&gt;  The girls continued to visit back and forth with their grandparents, and Martha Washington’s letters mark these occasions.&lt;ref name=Kail/&gt; Elizabeth and Martha taken often to Mount Vernon in George Washington’s coach.&lt;ref name=Kail/&gt;  When Eleanor Calvert Custis Stuart went to stay with her mother on her father’s death in 1788, the two sisters remained with Martha Washington.&lt;ref name=Kail/&gt;

The couple had one daughter who survived infancy, Elizabeth Law (19 January 1797 – 9 August 1822). Her daughter Elizabeth married Nicholas Lloyd Rogers&lt;ref name="justia"/&gt; on 5 April 1817.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Jefferson]], ed. [[J.

George and Martha Washington were unable to attend the Laws' wedding, but invited the couple to honeymoon in [[Philadelphia]] at the [[President's House (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|President's House]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lawler Jr., "The President's House Revisited", Historical Society of Pennsylvania, ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'', vol. 129, no. 4 (October 2005), pp. 397–98. {{cite web |url=http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/plans/pmhb2/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126110246/http://ushistory.org/presidentshouse/plans/pmhb2/index.htm |archivedate=2009-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The First Lady promised one of the slaves in the presidential household, [[Oney Judge]], as a wedding gift to the couple, but the young woman fled after learning of the plan. She reached Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she remained free. She married and had three children.&lt;ref&gt;1845 [[Oney Judge]] interview.{{cite web |url=http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/slaves/oneyinterview.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408073610/http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/slaves/oneyinterview.htm |archivedate=2009-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Martha Washington bequeathed her younger sister, Delphy, to the bride and groom instead. 

In 1800 Delphy married [[William Costin]], a free man, and lived with him in Washington, DC. Delphy and her children were manumitted by Thomas Law and Eliza P. Custis Law in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Wiencek, Henry (2003). ''An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves and the Creation of America'', New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pp. 84-86, 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt; Eliza remained in close contact with William and Delphy Costin throughout her life.

Upon her marriage, Elizabeth Law had inherited about 80 slaves from her late father's estate. After Martha Washington died in 1802, she inherited about 35 dower slaves from her grandfather [[Daniel Parke Custis#Custis Estate|Daniel Parke Custis's estate]]. Martha Washington had use of them in her lifetime. Following Elizabeth Law's mother's 1811 death, her father's estate was liquidated, and she inherited about 40 more slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Weincek, ''An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America'' (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2003), p. 383n.&lt;/ref&gt; She likely sold some of them for her support.

In March, 1796, Elizabeth and Thomas moved into the [[Thomas Law House]] near present-day 6th and N Streets [[Southwest, Washington, D.C.|Southwest]].&lt;ref name=Robins/&gt; The house became known as "Honeymoon House" as the Laws lived there for a few months while awaiting completion of their house. They moved at the end of August.&lt;ref name=Robins/&gt; The [[National Park Service]] listed the house on the [[National Register of Historic Places ]]on August 14, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120015833/http://focus.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/73002093|archivedate=2015-11-20|url=http://focus.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/73002093|title=Law, Thomas, House|work=Focus: Digital Access Management System|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her separation from Thomas, Elizabeth resided between 1805 and 1809 at a "small country house" and estate on Seminary Hill in Alexandria, which she called Mount Washington.&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;{{cite web | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/18599581.html?dids=18599581:18599581&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jun+29%2C+1995&amp;author=Sarah+Booth+Conroy&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=T.08&amp;desc=Hoxton+House%27s+Secret%3B+The+Orgins+of+The+Elegant+Gray+Stucco+Mansion+Were+Obscured+Until+Researchers+Digging+Through+Old+Records+Found+The+Owner%3A+a+Granddaughter+of+Martha+Washington. | title=Hoxton House's Secret; The Origins of The Elegant Gray Stucco Mansion Were Obscured Until Researchers Digging Through Old Records Found The Owner: a Granddaughter of Martha Washington. | date= June 29, 1995

==Death and interment==
Elizabeth Parke Custis Law died in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]] at the home of a friend "on Saturday night (that is, 31 December 1831), ten minutes before 12 o'clock," according to her obituary in the ''Richmond Enquirer.''&lt;ref name="Richmond Enquirer, 3 Jan. 1832"/&gt; (Her death date is sometimes given as 1 January 1832.) Her body was interred in the New Tomb at [[Mount Vernon]] on 7 January 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012210812/http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/burials-at-mount-vernon/|archivedate=2014-10-12|url=http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/burials-at-mount-vernon/|title=Burials at Mount Vernon|work=Digital Encyclopedia|publisher=George Washington's Mount Vernon|location=[[Mount Vernon]], [[Virginia]]|accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlement and estate==
Law made a marriage settlement with his wife at the time of their separation, providing for an annuity from certain real estate property. Her son-in-law Nicholas L. Rogers gained appointment as administrator of her estate in December 1832, on behalf of her three grandchildren (his children).&lt;ref name="justia"&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/58/417/ ''Adams v. Law,'' 58 U.S. 417 (1854)], Justia - US Supreme Court cases; accessed 5 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; He filed suit against the administrator of her marriage settlement for payment of annuities and interest that were outstanding. 

After Thomas Law's death in 1834, these issues became tied to settlement of his estate, which was contested for decades. He had made specific bequests for two grandchildren by his late natural son John, as well as for another natural son. He also had made bequests for his three legitimate grandchildren. The case was finally settled in 1854 by a US Supreme Court decision (''Adams v. Law''),&lt;ref name="justia"/&gt; by which time his remaining property was said to have greatly increased in value.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=T.

The '''General Service Respirator''' is a military gas mask designed to replace the previous [[S10 NBC Respirator|S10]] respirator for the [[British Armed Forces]]. It was designed by [[DSTL]] and Scott Safety in collaboration with the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]], and is manufactured by Scott Safety.

==History==
Design work started in 2000, and from the outset the GSR was designed to function better than the S10 in "hot, high and dry" environments whilst still keeping the S10's qualities in the temperate environments of Europe it was originally designed for. It was also designed to be worn for longer periods than the S10, having been designed for 24 hours of continuous use in [[CBRN]] environments as opposed to the previous design level of 4 hours.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The respirator was officially adopted into service with the Armed Forces on 26 August 2010, and training started during 2011, with [[British Forces Germany]] being first to field them. All new personnel are trained in use of the system. Existing personnel will be trained through refresher courses, starting with the [[British Army]], and continuing with the [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]]. By January 2015, all 300,000+ respirators had been delivered to the [[British Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=desider|date=9 January 2015|publisher=Ministry of Defence|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/393704/desider_80_Jan2015.pdf|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The new respirator, produced by Scott Health and Safety Ltd, reportedly provides a significantly higher level of protection. Features which differentiate it from the S10 which it replaced are:

* Twin filter canisters (can be changed more easily while in a [[CBRN]] environment)
* Single [[visor]] (better visibility and reduces the claustrophobic effect)
* Improved drinking system (a higher volume of water can be passed through the system)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0UQBHirYpI&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13720">The '''Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation''' is the country's largest statewide, nonprofit preservation organization with more than 8,000 members. Founded in 1973, the Trust is committed to preserving and enhancing Georgia’s communities and their diverse historic resources for the education and enjoyment of all.

The Georgia Trust generates community revitalization by finding buyers for endangered properties acquired by its ''Revolving Fund''; encourages neighborhood revitalization and provides design assistance to 105 Georgia ''Main Street'' cities; trains Georgia’s teachers to engage students in 61 Georgia school systems to discover state and national history through their local historic resources; and advocates for funding, tax incentives and other laws aiding preservation efforts.  The Georgia Trust is a recipient of the Trustees Award for Organizational Excellence from the National Trust for Historic Preservation.  [http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatsnew/boilerplate.htm]

[[Image:Rhodes Hall Exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Rhodes Hall]] serves as the headquarters for the Georgia Trust.]]
The Georgia Trust operates two historic house museums:
* [[Johnston-Felton-Hay House|Hay House]], 1859, Macon
* [[Rhodes Hall]], 1904, Atlanta

== Georgia Trust Programs ==
In addition to providing preservation resources for individuals and communities throughout the state, The Georgia Trust helps save endangered houses and buildings, uncover the beauty of downtown buildings, educate the next preservation generation, and advocate for preservation funding and laws through the following programs:

=== Revolving Fund for Endangered Properties ===
The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation established the Revolving Fund for endangered properties in 1990 to provide effective alternatives to demolition or neglect of architecturally and historically significant properties by promoting rehabilitation and enabling owners of endangered historic properties to connect with buyers who will rehabilitate their properties.

The Revolving Fund accomplishes this goal by either accepting property donations or by purchasing options on endangered historic properties. The properties are then marketed nationally to locate buyers who agree to preserve and maintain the structures. Protective covenants are attached to the deeds to ensure that the historic integrity of each property is retained, and purchasers are required to sign rehabilitation agreements based on the work to be performed on the structure.[http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/revolving_fund.htm]

=== Main Street Design Assistance Program ===
Since the Main Street program's start in 1980, The Georgia Trust has offered design assistance, on-site rehabilitation consultations, hands-on presentations and hand-drawn and digital renderings to help business owners and downtown managers rehabilitate and reuse their historic resources.

Services provided by The Georgia Trust's Main Street Design Assistance Program have become integral to downtown revitalization efforts. Supported by the Department of Community Affairs' (DCA) Office of Downtown Development, the program has assisted more than 3,000 business owners in 105 Main Street cities across Georgia to encourage the rehabilitation of historic downtown commercial buildings. [http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/main_streetda.htm]

=== Talking Walls ===
A recipient of a Governor's Award in the Humanities, the Talking Walls heritage education program has trained more than 1,700 teachers, who have reached more than 370,000 students in 61 school systems in Georgia since 1991. The program's teacher workshops and ongoing local support trains educators to use local historic resources such as photos, maps, oral histories and historic buildings as teaching tools in Georgia's mandated curriculum.

The Georgia Department of Education recently emphasized the Trust's key role as an important educational resource by approving the Trust as a partner in its Educational Initiatives Program. This status recognizes The Georgia Trust as an official collaborator with the DOE to provide quality instructional materials to educators across the state. Talking Walls also received statewide certification by the Georgia DOE, allowing the Trust to award professional recertification credits to teachers attending program workshops. [http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/talking_walls.htm]

=== Georgians for Preservation Action ===
Founded in 1987, the statewide coordinating council for historic preservation advocacy encourages laws, programs and policies that promote the preservation of Georgia’s historic resources by mobilizing grassroots preservationists across the state.[http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/georgians_preservation_action.htm]

Among its activities, GaPA:

* Annually develops and advocates a legislative agenda that represents a consensus of the leaders of key preservation constituencies on preservation issues. 
* Regularly communicates with historic preservation advocates about critical issues and legislation before the General Assembly. 
* Hosts a Legislative Reception for preservation supporters to meet with legislators. 
* Provides GaPA members with information on national preservation issues with news from the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] and Preservation Action, the national lobbying arm for historic preservation.

== ''Places in Peril'' ==
The Georgia Trust releases an annual list of endangered historic sites throughout Georgia. The ''Places in Peril'' program seeks to identify significant historic, archaeological and cultural properties that are threatened by demolition, deterioration or insensitive public policy or development, and have a demonstrable level of community interest, commitment and support. Through this program, the Trust encourages owners and individuals, organizations and communities to employ preservation tools, partnerships and resources necessary to preserve and utilize selected historic properties in peril.

Historic properties are selected for listing based on several criteria. Sites must be listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or the Georgia Register of Historic Places and must be subject to a serious threat to their existence or historical, architectural and/or archeological integrity. There must also be a demonstrable level of community commitment and support for the preservation of listed sites.[http://www.georgiatrust.org/preservation_resources/places_in_peril.htm]

== Publications ==

=== ''The Rambler'' ===

The ''Rambler'' is The Georgia Trust's quarterly publication. It is distributed to members of The Georgia Trust from around the state and to other state and national preservation organizations.

=== ''J. Neel Reid, Architect'' ===

Architect J. Neel Reid (and his partners in Hentz, Reid &amp; Adler) founded the Georgia school of classicists after study at Columbia University and abroad. Many sources influenced Reid’s architecture, and his interior and garden designs. His travel diary, sketchbooks and scrapbooks, and extensive library reflect this. His early-twentieth-century interest in historic preservation and contextual design, in architectural education and professional standards of practice inspired others long after his tragic early death of a brain tumor in 1926.

Reid’s father’s family were Troup County, Georgia, pioneers; he grew up in Macon, beginning apprenticeship and practice there before, in 1909, moving to Atlanta.

''J. Neel Reid, Architect'' by William R. Mitchell, Jr. and published by The Georgia Trust, gives new life to Reid’s rich legacy, keeping his influence fresh in this new century. The J. Neel Reid Prize, provided by a Georgia Trust fund produced from the sale of the book, helps ensure continuation of Reid’s influence among a new generation of architects.

Proceeds from book sales help support the J. Neel Reid Prize, a yearly award to an architecture student, an architect intern or a recently registered architect for study travel that honors the legacy of Neel Reid.

=== ''Democracy Restored: A History of the Georgia State Capitol'' ===

Written by Timothy J. Crimmins and Anne H. Farrisee with photographs by Diane Kirkland, the award-winning ''Democracy Restored'' is a stunning and fully illustrated history of the Georgia Capital that not only pays tribute to a grand ole edifice, but also vividly recounts the history that was made—and that continues to be made—within and without its walls. The Georgia Capitol is a place where, for more than a century, legislators have debated, governors have proclaimed, and courts have ruled. It is also a place where countless ordinary citizens have gathered in lively tour groups, angry protest mobs, and at times, solemn funeral processions.

Proceeds go to The Georgia Trust and the Capitol Restoration Fund.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4665">'''Gustavo Gabriel Levene''' (August 30, 1905 – 1987) was an Argentinian historian and writer.

==Biography==
Gustavo Gabriel Levene was born on August 30, 1905, in [[San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca]], [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[Argentina]] where he begins his elementary studies, later moving to [[Buenos Aires]], where he finishes his secondary studies.  He enrolls at the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Buenos Aires]] but he later drops out.  He then continued his studies at the Faculty of Humanities and Educational Science at the [[National University of La Plata|University of La Plata]], from where he graduated with a professor's degree.  As such, he holds several positions in different high schools, and was director of the Cangallo Schule school from 1962 to 1965.  He was also assistant to the minister of education, and member of the editorial board of the ''Biblioteca de Mayo'' (''May's Library'') of the Senate.

He was a prolific historian who conceived history from a human perspective through the common life of his historical characters, their traditions and beliefs.  This point of view was unique during a time in which history was written based on heroic military facts or about people who were able to change the course of history.  Among his works it stands out the ''New Argentine History, Costumbrist and Social View from the Conquest to Our Days'' ({{lang|es|Nueva historia argentina, panorama costumbrista y social desde la Conquista hasta nuestros días}}) and ''History of the Argentine Presidents'' (''Historia de los presidentes argentinos''), the latter covering from [[Bernardino Rivadavia]]'s presidency to the third presidency of [[Juan Domingo Perón]].  His interpretation of the nation's history adheres to the liberal tradition, viewing the colonial period like an arid and unprogressive era, having in Bernardino Rivadavia his early nineteenth century hero, and viewing [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] as a reactionary, defender of the colonial system who was useful for the British interests.&lt;ref&gt;Potash, Robert A., Book Review of La Argentina se Hizo Así, ''The Hispanic American Historical Review'', Vol. 43, No. 3, Aug., 1963, pp. 445-446.&lt;/ref&gt;  He stepped into the historical playwright with ''Mariano Moreno'', a play that won the First National Prize of Literature 1957.  He went on to write other historical plays about the personalities of [[José de San Martín]] and [[Juan Martín de Pueyrredón]] in ''The Unknown'' (''El desconocido''), Bernardino Rivadavia in ''Bernardino'', [[Esteban Echeverría]]  in ''The Tomorrow'' (''El mañana'') and [[Lucio V. Mansilla]] in ''A Man at the Mirror'' (''Un hombre ante el espejo'').  However, it is ''Childhood in Catamarca'' (''Niñez en Catamarca'') his most known and piece of work, which is an autobiographic tale that has been adopted by many Argentine schools as a lecture book.  Gustavo G. Levene died in Buenos Aires, in 1987.

Further, an individual PUF device must be easy to make but practically impossible to duplicate, even given the exact manufacturing process that produced it. In this respect it is the hardware analog of a [[one-way function]]. The name "physical unclonable function" might be a little misleading as some PUFs are clonable, and most PUFs are noisy and therefore do not achieve the requirements for a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. Today, PUFs are usually implemented in [[integrated circuits]] and are typically used in applications with high security requirements.

Many attacks on sensitive data and resources reported by organizations occur from within the organization itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hardware Security|url=http://web.mit.edu/rhel-doc/4/RH-DOCS/rhel-sg-en-4/s1-netprot-hardware.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Edith Vanderhoop Manning Murray''' (September 24, 1919 - January 25, 2008) was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American historian]] and author from the [[Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head|Aquinnah Wampanoag tribe]], known for her book "Moshup's Footsteps" published in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Kaylea|title=Helen Vanderhoop Manning Was Historian of Wampanoags|url=https://vineyardgazette.com/obituaries/2008/02/01/helen-vanderhoop-manning-was-historian-wampanoags}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her work as the education director at the Tribe.

==Marriage== 
While working at [[Fisk University]], Manning met Joseph Murray due to the fact that he was attending dental school in the same area. Shortly after meeting, in July 1946 the two married and resided in Washington D.C. until 1953. At that time, Joseph was deployed to Korea as part of the army. After returning home from overseas, the couple divorced. Manning was able to find love again and in 1961 she married James Manning, instantly becoming a stepmother to his three daughters, June, Judith, and Jyl. James Manning was also a member of the [[Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head]]. Together the two along with James’ parents (Captain Walter Manning and Ada) opened up a family restaurant. In addition they established a gift shop, Manning’s Snack Bar, and cottages near [[Gay Head Light|the town’s lighthouse]]. There, it was Manning’s role to prepare the food for the restaurant, including chowder, lobster, fried clams, and pie. Unfortunately, James Manning passed away in 1974, leaving Manning as a widow and closing down the family restaurant. Today, the restaurant has been transformed into a cottage and is rented out to visitors. However, in 2002 Manning and her first husband Joseph Murray rekindled their flame and remarried, residing in Washington D.C once more.

==Ancestry and childhood== 
Manning was born in [[Aquinnah, Massachusetts|Gay Head]] to mother Evelyn Magretta (Moss) and father Arthur Herbert Vanderhoop. As an only child, Manning was fortunate enough to spend her summers at [[Gay Head]] while receiving her education in Washington D.C. throughout the school year. Starting at the age of seven, she would live with her maternal grandmother Lavina Moss, aunt Edith Moss, and uncle Berry Armstrong Claytor during the school year in order to gain a higher level of education than she would at Gay Head. Also residing in her grandmothers home were Manning’s cousins Richard and Beryl, who became more like siblings. Even while being educated in Washington D.C, there was never a time that Manning didn’t look forward to returning to her simple life with [[cranberry bog]]s at Gay Head.

==Honoring her heritage== 
In 1972 Manning was able to give back to Gay Head in more ways than just teaching. For 16 years she served as the director on the Wampanoag Tribal Council. As a part of this council, she made it her duty to fight for [[federal recognition]] of her tribe. And in April 1987, the tribe did receive its federal recognition, marking this as one of Manning’s biggest accomplishments. Upon gaining this recognition, Manning became the tribal council secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=Helen|title=Dawnland Voices: An Anthology of Indigenous Writing from New England|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=450–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she didn’t stop there, in November 1974 she was elected to the Martha’s Vineyard Commission. She received the most votes throughout the island, bringing in 2,161 votes. In addition, from 1976-1979 Manning was the Gay Head selectman, on the Aquinnah Cultural Council, and Philbin scholarship committee, all while being the library trustee for over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral History Unit: An Interview with Aquinnah Wampanoag Elder Helen Manning|url=http://www.wampanoagtribe.net/pages/wampanoag_education/manning?textPage=1|website=Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head==
Manning was the director of education for the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head. As part of this position she served on many committees such as the human services, health, hospitality and Christiantown museum. Also, on the Aquinnah Cultural Board, she was a part of the community service programs as well as the language revitalization program. She represented her people on the Massachusetts Commission on Indian Affairs in addition to being the treasurer of the Aquinnah Cultural Center. Reminding her of her childhood education in Washington D.C. she also gave back to the students by chaperoning the American Indian Youth Summit taking place in D.C. during 1998, 1999, and 2001. She accomplished all of this before officially retiring as the director of education for the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Associated Press|title=Gay Head or Aquinnah?

An '''information assurance vulnerability alert''' ('''IAVA''') is an announcement of a computer [[application software]] or [[operating system]] [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] notification in the form of alerts, bulletins, and technical advisories identified by DoD-CERT, a division of the [[USCYBERCOM|United States Cyber Command]]. These selected vulnerabilities are the mandated [[Baseline (configuration management)|baseline]], or minimum configuration of all hosts residing on the [[Global Information Grid|GIG]].  [[USCYBERCOM]] analyzes each [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] and determines if it is necessary or beneficial to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to release it as an IAVA.   Implementation of IAVA policy will help ensure that [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] Components take appropriate mitigating actions against vulnerabilities to avoid serious compromises to [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] computer system assets that would potentially degrade mission performance.

==Information assurance vulnerability management (IAVM) program== 
[[Unified Combatant Command|The combatant commands]], services, agencies and field activities are required to implement vulnerability notifications in the form of alerts, bulletins, and technical advisories. [[USCYBERCOM]] has the authority to direct corrective actions, which may ultimately include disconnection of any enclave, or affected system on the enclave, not in compliance with the IAVA program directives and vulnerability response measures (i.e. communication tasking orders or messages). [[USCYBERCOM]] will coordinate with all affected organizations to determine operational impact to the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] before instituting a disconnection.

==Background==
On February 15, 1998, the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]] issued a classified memorandum on [[Information Assurance]], that instructed the [[Defense Information Systems Agency|DISA]], with the assistance of the Military Departments, to develop an alert system that ensured positive control of information assurance. According to the memorandum, the alert system should:

* Identify a system administrator to be the point of contact for each relevant network system,
* Send alert notifications to each point of contact,
* Require confirmation by each point of contact acknowledging receipt of each alert notification,
* Establish a date for the corrective action to be implemented, and enable [[Defense Information Systems Agency|DISA]] to confirm whether the correction has been implemented.

The [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]] issued an Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) policy memorandum on December 30, 1999.  Current events of the time demonstrated that widely known vulnerabilities exist throughout DoD networks, with the potential to severely degrade mission performance. The policy memorandum instructs the [[Defense Information Systems Agency|DISA]] to develop and maintain an IAVA [[database]] system that would ensure a positive control mechanism for system administrators to receive, acknowledge, and comply with system vulnerability alert notifications. The IAVA policy requires the [[Unified Combatant Command|Component Commands]], Services, and Agencies to register and report their acknowledgement of and compliance with the IAVA [[database]]. According to the policy memorandum, the compliance data to be reported should include the number of assets affected, the number of assets in compliance, and the number of assets with waivers.

'''James Outram Fraser''' (Chinese 富能仁) (1886–1938) was a British [[Protestant]] Christian [[missionary]] to China with the [[China Inland Mission]]. He pioneered work among the [[Lisu people]], of Southwestern China, in the early part of the 20th century. He is credited with the Fraser alphabet for their language.

== Early life ==
Born in London in 1886. Fraser had four brothers and sisters. His parents divorced when Fraser was a teen, his mother moving to Letchworth, buying property with her own funds.

By 1906, he was at [[Imperial College London]] studying engineering. Fraser was accomplished in piano and held a recital in his twenties before he left for China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fraser Crossman|first1=Eileen|title=Mountain Rain|date=1994|publisher=Harold Shaw Publishers|location=Wheaton, Ill|isbn=9 780877 885511|page=3–7|edition=OMF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First years in Yunnan==
He became a graduate engineer. However, in 1908 he dedicated his life to missionary work and joined the China Inland Mission. He arrived in China at 22 and travelled from Shanghai to Hong Kong and then to the mountainous region of China's far southwest.

He was forced by the chaos accompanying the [[Chinese Revolution of 1911]] to divide his time between [[Yunnan Province]] and [[Burma]]. He learned the Lisu language and commenced his work among the Lisu, a Tibeto-Burmese minority people who lived in the high mountains along the borders of the two countries.

Fraser had arrived in Yunnan in 1910, and spent nearly thirty years working among the Lisu. Fraser is best known for the alphabet he created for the Lisu, often referred to as the [[Fraser alphabet]]. It was designed for purpose of translating the [[New Testament]] into the Lisu language. Fraser also designed a written musical notation for transcribing the Lisu's oral history songs.

Going to China with CIM (China Inland Mission), he was stationed in the then remote province of Yunnan to work with the local Chinese, but Fraser was a keen climber and revelled in climbing through the mountains meeting and preaching to the Lisu people, particularly in the upper [[Salween River]] valley. Readily accepted by them and able to live in their mud floor huts, he was able to communicate a little through Chinese and then to learn their language, which is in the [[Tibeto-Burman]] group. Initial success was followed by years of doubt and difficulty until 1916, when he and fellow missionaries started to see scores of families convert to Christianity and enthusiastically pursue a new life without the fear of the spirits that had previously characterised them.

By 1918, sparked by family [[evangelism]] carried on by the people themselves, 600 believers had been baptised. Fraser was known for his ability to organise the people into strong indigenous churches that became models for church-planting ventures not only for other minority peoples in China's southwest but also for other countries.

Aware that they would soon need material in their language, he began work immediately on Mark's gospel and a hymnbook since they showed great interest in writing and were already great singers and natural musicians.

== Furlough and marriage==
Fraser went back to England on furlough in 1924 and when he returned to "Lisuland" in 1929, he was married, to Roxie Dymond, the daughter of a [[Methodist]] missionary stationed in [[Kunming]].

== Revival and the Fraser alphabet==
Fraser developed a script for the Lisu language and used it to prepare a [[catechism]], portions of Scripture, and eventually, with much help from his colleagues, a complete [[New Testament]]. Working initially on Mark and John and then on a handbook of Lisu history and language, Fraser handed on the translation task to [[Allyn Cooke]] and his wife, Leila. He came back to help the team with revision and checking in the mid-1930s. The complete New Testament was finished in 1936.

Fraser maintained a consistent policy of training the Lisu converts (usually whole households and whole villages at a time) to be self-supporting and to pay for their own books and church buildings. They raised their own funds for the support of pastors, of wives and children of their travelling [[Evangelism|evangelists]] and of festivals and other occasions. Unlike other missionaries of his generation, Fraser would not pay local preachers to go out or for building local church structures. That was something that put the Lisu in good stead for the years of Japanese occupation and the Communist persecution, particularly during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

Nevertheless, tens of thousands of them fled during this era to neighbouring Burma and [[Thailand]]. Fraser also left church government in the hands of Lisu elders; very little imprint was made on them that had a home church character, other than the tremendous prayer support the Fraser organised back in England for the Lisu and his work.

Throughout the 1930s, other missionaries came to assist in the work, but the bulk of the conversions happened as a result of Lisu evangelists covering the ground and reaching not only the Lisu but also the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]] and [[Yi people]] (Nosu). Revivals also broke out at this time. It is acknowledged by the Chinese government that by the 1990s, over 90% of the Lisu in China were Christian.

== Final years and legacy==
Fraser wrote many articles in English for "The Chinese Recorder" and "China's Millions". After seeing great fruit for his labours, James Outram Fraser died in [[Baoshan, Yunnan|Baoshan]], in western Yunnan in 1938 of cerebral [[malaria]], leaving his pregnant wife and two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fraser Crossman|first1=Eileen|title=Mountain Rain|date=1994|publisher=Harold Shaw Publishers|location=Wheaton, Ill|isbn=9 780877 885511|page=234–237|edition=OMF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 52.

His main biographer was Mrs. Howard Taylor, who published "Behind The Ranges" in 1944, containing numerous extracts from his letters and diaries. His daughter, Eileen Crossman, gives his biography, "Mountain Rain", in 1982, much of her material being drawn from Taylor (1944). Fraser's grave is now at the [[Qing Hua church]].

{{quote|"On September 25, 1938, while in Baoshan Yunnan, China, James Fraser died at the age of 52. Due to land erosion, West Yunnan's Christian church decided to move the grave from the mountain slopes of Baoshan to this location, renewing the headstone on behalf of the Lisu church as a way of expressing their cherished memory of J.O. Fraser.
Fraser's life has reaped a large harvest although many tears had first to be sown through his labours.}}
       
{{quote|"The Lisu church at Baoshan plans to commemorate J.O. Fraser every seven years at a special Easter service in the new Bible training center they have started there.
Another memorial to J.O. Fraser has been erected by Lisu believers in [[Weixi County]] in far northwestern Yunnan. Inscribed in Lisu, Chinese and English the English reads: “IN LOVING MEMORY. JAMES O. FRASER 1886–1938. How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news. WITH DEEPEST LOVE REMEMBER YOU ALWAYS—THE LISU CHURCH.” The Chinese states additionally: “Erected by the Christian Church in the Lisu Autonomous County of Weixi on 15 March 2004.”}}

{{quote|"The Lisu church has seen spectacular numerical growth in recent decades. In 1950 the [[Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture]] had 14,800 believers. By 1995 that number had risen to over 100,000—most of them Lisu. In the early 1980s the [[Yunnan Christian Council]] printed several thousand copies of the Lisu Bible. Then in 1995 a further 45,000 Lisu Bibles were published, as well as 65,000 Lisu hymnbooks. Both printings were in the special script devised by J.O. Fraser. However, the church is still hampered by endemic poverty, illiteracy and lack of trained pastors and evangelists. The rapid development of Yunnan as a tourist region and the tidal wave of emigration of young tribal people from the remote mountain valleys to the cities in search of work are bringing many changes to the Lisu church, not all of them positive.}}
 
In 1992, the Chinese government officially recognised the [[Fraser alphabet]] as the official script of the [[Lisu language]]. Today, Fraser is remembered as one of Christianity's most successful missionaries to [[East Asia]] in modern times.

Christianity is thriving in the [[Salween River]] valley, where the Lisu live nearly 70 years after the death of Fraser. Of the 18,000 Lisu who lived in [[Fugong]] in 1950, 3,400 professed faith in Christ. As of 2007, there are estimated to be 80–90 percent of the 70,000 making the same profession. In Yunnan it is estimated that there are 100,000–200,000 total Lisu Christians in the [[Lisu Church]]. More than 75,000 Lisu Bibles have been legally printed in China following the explosive growth.&lt;ref&gt;OMF International (2007), p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6692">[[File:Jean-Henri Merle d'Aubigné (Harper's Engraving).png|thumb|right|Engraving of Merle d'Aubigné from 1872.]]
'''Jean-Henri Merle d'Aubigné''' (16 August 1794{{snd}}21 October 1872) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Protestant]] [[Minister of religion|minister]] and [[historian]] of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

==Life==
Jean-Henri Merle d'Aubigné was born at [[Eaux Vives]], a neighbourhood of [[Geneva]]. A street in the area is named after him. The ancestors of his father [[Robert Merle d'Aubigné]] (1755–1799), were French Protestant refugees. 
The life Jean-Henri's parents chose for him was in commerce; but in college at the Académie de Genève, he instead decided on Christian ministry.  
He was profoundly influenced by [[Robert Haldane]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} the Scottish missionary and preacher who visited Geneva and became a leading light in [[Christian revival#Europe: Le R.C3.A9veil|''Le Réveil'']], a conservative Protestant evangelical movement.

It was in small extra-curricular groups led by Haldane, that Merle d'Aubigné and his peers studied the [[Bible]]; according to church historian John Carrick, no classes were offered in the Christian scriptures at the school at that time, their having been replaced by the ancient Greek scholars.&lt;ref name="Carrick"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carrick|first=John|title=J.H. Merle D'Aubigné: The People's Historian|url=http://www.visionforum.com/news/articles/2005-04-14_001.aspx|date=15 April 2006|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Merle d'Aubigné went abroad to further his education in 1817, Germany was about to celebrate the tercentenary of the Reformation; and thus early he conceived the ambition to write the history of that great epoch. 
Studying at [[Berlin University]] for eight months 1817–1818,&lt;ref&gt;Roney, John B (1996). ''The inside of history: Jean Henri Merle d'Aubigné and romantic historiography.'' {{ISBN|978-0-313-28807-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merle d'Aubigné received inspiration from teachers as diverse as [[Johann August Wilhelm Neander|J. A. W. Neander]] and [[W. M. L. de Wette]]. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1818, Merle d'Aubigné took the post of pastor of the French Protestant church at [[Hamburg]], where he served for five years. 
In 1823, he was called to become pastor of the Franco-German [[Brussels Protestant Church]]&lt;ref&gt;{{BBKL|m/merle|band=5|autor=Erich Wenneker|artikel=Merle d'Aubigné, Jean-Henri|spalten=1317–1321}}&lt;/ref&gt; and preacher to the court of King [[William I of the Netherlands]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F11272.php&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Belgian revolution]] of 1830, Merle d'Aubigné thought it advisable to undertake pastoral work at home in Switzerland rather than accept an educational post in the family of the Dutch king. 
The [[Evangelical Society]] had been founded with the idea of promoting evangelical Christianity in Geneva and elsewhere, but a need arose for a theological seminary to train pastors. 
On his return to Switzerland, Merle d'Aubigné was invited to become professor of church history in such a seminary, and he also continued to labor in the cause of evangelical Protestantism. 
In him the Evangelical Alliance found a hearty promoter. He frequently visited England, was made a D.C.L. v Oxford University, and received civic honors from the city of Edinburgh. He died suddenly in 1872.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The first portion of Merle d'Aubigné's ''Histoire de la Reformation'' - ''History of the Reformation of the Sixteenth Century'' - which was devoted to the earlier period of the movement in Germany, i.e., [[Martin Luther]]'s time, at once earned a foremost place among modern French ecclesiastical historians, and was translated into most European languages. The second portion, ''The History of the Reformation in Europe in the Time of Calvin'', dealing with reform in the [[John Calvin|French reformer]]'s sphere, exhaustively treats the subject with the same scholarship as the earlier work, but the second volume did not meet with the same success. It is part of the subject Merle d'Aubigné was most competent to discuss, and was nearly completed at the time of his death.  Such was the scope Merle d'Aubigné's scholarship and his level of dedication, states church historian John Carrick, that Merle d'Aubigné " visited the major libraries of Central and Western Europe in order to read original documents in Latin, French, German, Dutch, and English."&lt;ref name="Carrick" /&gt;

Among minor treatises authored by Merle d'Aubigné, the most important are his vindication of the character and the aims of [[Oliver Cromwell]], and his sketch of the trendings of the [[Church of Scotland]].

His principal works are 
* ''Discours sur étude de l'histoire du christianisme'' (Geneva, 1832)
* ''Le Luthranisme et la Reforme'' (Paris, 1844)

'''''La Sainte Courtisane''''' ({{IPA-fr|la sɛ̃t kuʁ.ti.zan|pron}}, [[French language|French]] for "The Holy [[Courtesan]]") is an [[unfinished work|unfinished play]] by [[Oscar Wilde]] written in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Ellerman, Richard. ''Oscar Wilde''. Penguin Books, 1987, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; The original draft was left in a taxi cab by the author, and was never completed. It was first published in 1908 by Wilde's literary executor, Robert Ross.&lt;ref&gt;Severi, Rita. "
''La Sainte Courtisane'' by Oscar Wilde. Dramatic Oxymoron and Saintly Pursuits" in ''The Journal of Drama Studies'' January 2007, pp.57-71 (http://www.oscholars.com/TO/Appendix/Library/Severi.htm Retrieved 2011-02-06)&lt;/ref&gt; It has never been performed, and has been little studied.

==Summary==

===''Dramatis Personae''===
*Myrrhina, a rich temptress and the "Courtisane" of the title
*Honorius, a hermit of the desert who will not look at women
*First and Second Man, who talk to Myrrhina, provide exposition about Honorius and talk of the gods they have seen.

===Synopsis===
The play is incomplete. The plot of the existing segment is as follows: Myrrhina is an Alexandrian noblewoman who travels to the mountains to tempt Honorius, a Christian hermit, away from goodness with her beauty and wealth. After they talk, he decides to return to sin in Alexandria while she discovers religion and chooses to remain in the desert.

[[Robbie Ross]] summarises the complete plot in his introduction to ''Miscellanies'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Honorius the hermit, so far as I recollect the story, falls in love with the courtesan who has come to tempt him, and he reveals to her the secret of the Love of God.  She immediately becomes a Christian, and is murdered by robbers; Honorius the hermit goes back to Alexandria to pursue a life of pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Robbie (ed.) in Wilde, Oscar ''Miscellanies''. 1908, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
Oscar Wilde began work on the play in 1894,&lt;ref&gt;Ellerman, Richard. ''Oscar Wilde''. Penguin Books, 1987, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; between writing ''[[Salome]]'' and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', but did not complete it before his trial and imprisonment. The fragments were first published in 1908 in Methuen's ''Collected Works'', along with an introduction by Robbie Ross which explained its intervening history:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"At the time of Wilde’s trial the nearly completed drama was entrusted to Mrs. Leverson, who in 1897 went to Paris on purpose to restore it to the author.  Wilde immediately left the manuscript in a cab...All my attempts to recover the lost work failed.  The passages here reprinted are from some odd leaves of a first draft.  The play is of course not unlike Salome, though it was written in English.  It expanded Wilde’s favourite theory that when you convert some one to an idea, you lose your faith in it; the same motive runs through Mr. W. H."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Robbie (ed.) in Wilde, Oscar ''Miscellanies''. 1908, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wilde considered revisiting the play in 1897 after his release from prison,&lt;ref&gt;Ellerman, Richard. ''Oscar Wilde''. Penguin Books, 1987, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt; but he lacked motivation for literary work in this period.

==Reception==
Wilde's own opinion of the play changed over time. During his imprisonment, it was much on his mind,&lt;ref&gt;Severi, Rita. "
''La Sainte Courtisane'' by Oscar Wilde. Dramatic Oxymoron and Saintly Pursuits" in ''The Journal of Drama Studies'' January 2007, pp.57-71 (http://www.oscholars.com/TO/Appendix/Library/Severi.htm Retrieved 2011-02-06)&lt;/ref&gt; describing it as one among his "beautiful coloured, musical things".&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde, edited by M. Holland and R. Hart-Davis, New York 2000, p. 759&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ross describes his changed mood after his release:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A few days later he laughingly informed me of the loss, and added that a cab was a very proper place for it.  I have explained elsewhere that he looked on his plays with disdain in his last years, though he was always full of schemes for writing others."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Robbie (ed.) in Wilde, Oscar ''Miscellanies''. 1908, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Biographer [[Richard Ellmann]] identifies a similarity to [[Anatole France]]'s novel ''[[Thaïs]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Ellerman, Richard. ''Oscar Wilde''. Penguin Books, 1987, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Rita Severi also suggests [[Saint Pelagia]], Saint Mary the Egyptian, [[Mary Magdalen]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]] as models for Myrrhina, and the Indian legend of [[Barlaam and Josaphat]] as inspiration for the plot.&lt;ref&gt;Severi, Rita. "
''La Sainte Courtisane'' by Oscar Wilde. Dramatic Oxymoron and Saintly Pursuits" in ''The Journal of Drama Studies'' January 2007, pp.57-71 (http://www.oscholars.com/TO/Appendix/Library/Severi.htm Retrieved 2011-02-06)&lt;/ref&gt;

Severi has compared the exploration of the spiritual and sensual life to a similar thread running throughout ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', ''[[Salome]]'' and ''[[The Fisherman and his Soul]]'', identifying it as part of "Wilde’s Parisian, [[Symbolist]] phase":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"La Sainte Courtisane is neither a comedy nor a parody. It contains all the elements of  the Symbolist Mystery play: symbolic characters that embody ethical, philosophical, spiritual ideas; one main action (drama) that unfolds in three macro-sequences or tableaux and around which the whole play revolves, in some unidentified space (the desert) and time ( a timeless past); highly metaphoric, repetitive language that reverberates in the rhythmic dialogue like a music of words or, as Wilde had said of the language of Salomé, like the sound of a pearl that falls on a silver basin. Elaborate speech patterns that unfold a double meaning, an allegory."&lt;ref&gt;Severi, Rita. " ''La Sainte Courtisane'' by Oscar Wilde. Dramatic Oxymoron and Saintly Pursuits" in ''The Journal of Drama Studies'' January 2007, pp.57-71 (http://www.oscholars.com/TO/Appendix/Library/Severi.htm Retrieved 2011-02-06)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Christopher S. Nassaar described the play as "a minor ''jeux d’esprit''",&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Nassaar, Wilde’s La Sainte Courtisane, in “Explicator”, Fall 1997, pp. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt; and places it in context as a "bridge" between ''[[Salome]]'' and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.

[[Rudolf Wagner-Régeny]] set the fragments to music in 1930 for 4 speakers and chamber orchestra.

'''Ludvig Ludvigsen Daae''' (7 December 1834 – 17 March 1910) was a Norwegian historian and author. He was a professor at the [[University of Oslo]] for more than thirty years.
==Biography==
He was born in [[Aremark]] in [[Østfold]] and died in [[Kristiania]] (now Oslo), Norway. He was the son of Ludvig Daae (1806–35) and Sara Jessine Louise Brock (1811–91).  He was a student at [[Oslo Cathedral School|Christiania Cathedral School]]  and graduated during  1852. He studied classical philology at the [[University of Oslo|University of Kristiania]] (now University of Oslo) and graduated  in 1859.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ludvig Ludvigsen Daae |first=Gunnar Christie |last=Wasberg |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Ludvig_Ludvigsen_Daae |language=Norwegian|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daae was assigned as a professor at the University of Kristiania  for more than thirty years  from 1876 to 1910. Daae was appointed professor of history at the University after [[Oluf Rygh]] had transferred to a professorship in archeology.   At the time of his retirement  his successor as a professor of history was [[Halvdan  Koht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://nbl.snl.no/Oluf_Rygh|title=   Oluf Rygh |publisher=  Norsk biografisk leksikon |author= Åsmund Svendsen |accessdate= February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://nbl.snl.no/Halvdan_Koht|title=   Halvdan Koht
|publisher=  Norsk biografisk leksikon|author= Åsmund Svendsen|accessdate= February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daae published a large number of historic works  and was also a frequent contributor to newspapers. Among his other works in 1880 he wrote a biography of [[Ludvig Holberg]] and in 1899 he published an edition of [[Claus Pavels]]{{'s}} diaries from the period 1817 to 1822. He was decorated Commander, Second Class of the [[Order of St. Olav]] in 1905. He was a Knight of the Danish [[Order of Dannebrog]] and of the Swedish [[Order of the Polar Star]].&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Ludvig Ludvigsen Daae |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Åsmund |last=Svendsen |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Ludvig_Ludvigsen_Daae/utdypning |language=Norwegian|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludvig Daae wrote his personal memoirs in 1888-93 and in 1901. In 1944,  [[Wilhelm Munthe]]  published [https://www.nb.no/items/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2007011800005 ''Professor Ludvig Daae : en minnebok''] (Oslo: Cammermeyer, 1944). In 2003, Daae's great-grandson, [[Nic Knudtzon|Nicolay Heinrich  Knudtzon]], edited and published an edition of Daae's memoirs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/skandalose-kroniker/65942160|title= Skandaløse krøniker |publisher=  Dagbladet  |author=  Espen Søbye|date= 26  January 2004 |accessdate= February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">'''Moses Bruine Cotsworth''' ([[Willitoft]], [[Yorks]] 3 December 1859 - [[Vancouver]] 4 June 1943) was a British accountant, business analyst, and [[calendar reform]]er.

He started his career in a variety of companies where his analytical skills were valuable.  Based on his work at the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway Company]], he published a book on railway rates. In 1907, he was chosen to chair a commission to reorganize the [[British Columbia]] [[civil service]].

His interest in [[calendar reform]] began when he was working at a railroad company. He found that monthly accounting was greatly complicated by the fact that months did not divide evenly into weeks. He devised what is now known as the [[International Fixed Calendar]], a solar calendar in which each of 13 months has 28 days. In 1922, he founded the [[International Fixed Calendar League]] in an effort to gain adoption of his calendar by businesses and government. American entrepreneur [[George Eastman]] adopted the calendar for use in his [[Eastman Kodak Company]], where it was used from 1928 to 1982. 

Later in life Cotsworth moved to [[British Columbia]]. He died in Vancouver.

==Legacy and honors==
Cotsworth was elected as a Fellow of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales|Institute of Chartered Accountants]], of the [[Royal Statistical Society]], and of the [[Geological Society]].

{{Main|AIDS origin|Discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories}}
{{alternative medicine sidebar}}
The '''oral polio vaccine (OPV) AIDS hypothesis''' posits that the [[AIDS]] [[pandemic]] originated from live [[polio vaccine]]s prepared in [[chimpanzee]] tissue cultures and then administered to up to one million Africans between 1957 and 1960 in experimental mass vaccination campaigns.

Data analyses in [[molecular biology]] and [[phylogenetic]] studies contradict the OPV AIDS hypothesis; consequently, [[scientific consensus]] regards the hypothesis as disproven.&lt;ref name=Science&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hillis DM |title=AIDS. Origins of HIV |journal=Science |volume=288 |issue=5472 |pages=1757–1759 |year=2000 |pmid=10877695 |doi=10.1126/science.288.5472.1757}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Birmingham K |title=Results make a monkey of OPV-AIDS theory |journal=Nat Med |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=1067–1067 |year=2000 |pmid=11017114 |doi=10.1038/80356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cohen2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/od/science/iso/concerns/archive/aids_and_vaccines.htm Origin of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS)] [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] website, Accessed 30 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' has described the hypothesis as "refuted".&lt;ref name="worobey"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Worobey M, Santiago M, Keele B, Ndjango J, Joy J, Labama B, Dhed'A B, Rambaut A, Sharp P, Shaw G, Hahn B |title=Origin of AIDS: contaminated polio vaccine theory refuted |journal=Nature |volume=428 |issue=6985 |pages=820–820 |year=2004 |pmid=15103367 |doi=10.1038/428820a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background: polio vaccines ==
{{details|Polio vaccine}}
Two [[vaccine]]s are used throughout the world to combat [[poliomyelitis]].  The first polio vaccine, developed by [[Jonas Salk]], is an ''inactivated [[poliovirus]] vaccine'' (IPV), consisting of a mixture of three wild, [[virulent]] strains of poliovirus, grown in a type of monkey [[kidney]] tissue culture ([[Vero cell]] line), and made noninfectious by [[formalin]] treatment. The second vaccine, an ''oral polio vaccine'' (OPV), is a live-[[attenuated vaccine]], produced by the passage of the virus through non-human cells at a sub-[[physiological]] temperature. The passage of virus produces mutations within the viral genome, and hinders the virus's ability to infect nervous tissue.&lt;ref name=Kew_2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kew O, Sutter R, de Gourville E, Dowdle W, Pallansch M |title=Vaccine-derived polioviruses and the endgame strategy for global polio eradication |journal=Annu Rev Microbiol |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=587–635 |year=2005 |pmid=16153180 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123625|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1235033/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both vaccines have been used for decades to induce [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to polio, and to stop the spread of the infection. However, OPV has several advantages; because the vaccine is introduced in the gastrointestinal tract, the primary site of poliovirus infection and replication, it closely mimics a natural infection. OPV also provides long lasting immunity, and stimulates the production of polio neutralizing [[antibody|antibodies]] in the [[pharynx]] and gut.&lt;ref name = Pearce&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pearce J |title=Salk and Sabin: poliomyelitis immunisation |url= http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/75/11/1552 |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=75 |issue=11 |pages=1552–1552 |year=2004 |pmid = 15489385 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.028530 |pmc=1738787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, OPV not only prevents paralytic poliomyelitis, but also, when given in sufficient doses, can stop a threatening epidemic. Other benefits of OPV include ease of administration, low cost and suitability for mass vaccination campaigns.&lt;ref name=Kew_2005/&gt;

=== Oral polio vaccine ===
Oral polio vaccines were developed in the late 1950s by several groups, including those led by [[Albert Sabin]], [[Hilary Koprowski]] and [[H. R. Cox]].&lt;ref name=Furesz&gt;{{cite journal |author=Furesz J |title=Developments in the production and quality control of poliovirus vaccines – Historical perspectives |journal=Biologicals |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=87–90 |year=2006 |pmid=16621594 |doi=10.1016/j.biologicals.2006.02.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poliovirus type 1 strain called SM was reported in 1954. A less virulent version of the SM strain was reported by Koprowski in 1957. The name of the vaccine strain was "CHAT" after "Charlton", the name of the child who was the donor of the precursor virus.&lt;ref name=Plotkin&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plotkin SA |last2=Modlin |first2=J. F. |last3=Plotkin |first3=S. A. |title=CHAT oral polio vaccine was not the source of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 group M for humans|journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=32 |issue=7 |pages=1068–1084 |year=2001 |pmid=11264036 |doi=10.1086/319612}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sabin, Koprowski and Cox vaccines were clinically tested in millions of individuals and found to be safe and effective. Because monkey trials found fewer side effects with the Sabin vaccine, in the early 1960s, the Sabin vaccine was licensed in the USA and its use supported by the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="Furesz"/&gt;

Between 1957 and 1960, Koprowski's vaccine was administered to roughly one million people in the Belgian territories, now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]].&lt;ref name=Plotkin/&gt; In 1960, Koprowski wrote in the ''British Medical Journal'', "The Belgian Congo trials have enlarged considerably and ... more vaccination campaigns organized in several provinces of the Belgian Congo are raising the number of vaccinated individuals into the millions."''(p.&amp;nbsp;90)'' Koprowski and his group also published a series of detailed reports on the vaccination of 76,000 children under the age of 5 (and European adults) in the area of Leopoldville (now [[Kinshasa]]) in Belgian Congo from 1958–1960; these reports begin with an overview,&lt;ref name=Koprowski5&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5192.85 |author=Koprowski H |title=Historical aspects of the development of live virus vaccine in poliomyelitis |journal=Br Med J |volume=2 |issue=5192 |pages=85–91 |date=July 1960 |pmid=14410975 |pmc=2096806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; next a review of safety and efficacy,&lt;ref name=Koproski2&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Plotkin SA, LeBrun A, Koprowski H |title=Vaccination with the CHAT strain of type 1 attenuated poliomyelitis virus in Leopoldville.

=== Vaccine production ===
In the 1950s, before dangers inherent to the process were well controlled, seed stocks of vaccines were occasionally transported to distant regions, then standard [[tissue culture]] methods&lt;ref name=Enders&gt;{{cite book |author=Enders, John |chapter=The present status of tissue-culture techniques in the study of poliomyelitis viruses |editor=Debré, R. |title=Poliomyelitis |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |year=1955 |pages=269–94 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/monograph/WHO_MONO_26_(part3).pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rappaport&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rappaport, Catherine |title=Trypsinization of Monkey-Kidney Tissue: Automatic Method for the Preparation of Cell Suspensions |journal=Bull World Health Organ |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=147–66 |year=1956 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/bulletin/1956/Vol14/Vol14-No1/bulletin_1956_14(1)_147-166.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=13329843 |pmc=2538109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Melnick&gt;Melnick, JL (1956) "Tissue culture methods for the cultivation of poliomyelitis and other viruses", in American Public Health Association, ''Diagnostic Procedures for Virus and Rickettsial Diseases'' 2nd ed., New York, pp. 97–151&lt;/ref&gt; were used to amplify the virus at local production facilities.

In [[French West Africa]] and [[Equatorial Africa]], [[baboons]] were used to amplify a vaccine from the Pasteur Institute. In Poland, the CHAT vaccine was amplified using Asian [[macaques]].&lt;ref name=PlotkinSA/&gt;

== Development of hypothesis ==
In 1987, Blaine Elswood contacted journalist Tom Curtis about a "bombshell story" on OPV and AIDS. Curtis published an article on the OPV AIDS hypothesis in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Curtis, Tom |authorlink=Tom Curtis (journalist) |title=The Origin of AIDS: A startling new theory attempts to answer the question, 'Was it an act of God or an act of man? |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=626 |pages=54–9, 61, 106, 108 |date=19 March 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Hilary Koprowski sued ''Rolling Stone'' and Tom Curtis for [[defamation]]. The magazine published a clarification which praised Koprowski and stated:
{{Quotation|The editors of Rolling Stone wish to clarify that they never intended to suggest in the article that there is any scientific proof, nor do they know of any scientific proof, that Dr. Koprowski, an illustrious scientist, was in fact responsible for introducing AIDS to the human population or that he is the father of AIDS.&lt;ref name=RS671&gt;{{cite news |author=Editor |title='Origin of AIDS' update - Clarification |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=671 |page=39 |date=December 9, 1993 }} This 'Clarification' article forms part of the defamation settlement when Hilary Koprowski sued Tom Curtis &amp; Rolling Stone magazine in 1992-93.&lt;/ref&gt;}} ''Rolling Stone'' was ordered to pay $1 [[USD]] in damages whilst incurring around $500,000 USD in legal fees for its own defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin B |title=Investigating the origin of AIDS: some ethical dimensions |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=253–256 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12930866 |pmc=1733782 |doi=10.1136/jme.29.4.253 |url=http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/29/4/253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few scientists, notably the biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]], thought the hypothesis required serious investigation, but they received little support from the scientific community.

Journalist Edward Hooper detailed the hypothesis in his 1999 book, ''The River''. Hooper further expanded on his allegations in a 2000 meeting in London, at the [[Royal Society]], although these claims were later rebutted by some of the scientists who were present at the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Plotkin SA, Teuwen DE, Prinzie A, Desmyter J |title=Postscript relating to new allegations made by Edward Hooper at The Royal Society Discussion Meeting on 11 September 2000 |journal=Philos.

[[File:Cg-map.png|275px|thumb|right|The Laboratoire Médical de Stanleyville was sited at the city now known as [[Kisangani]]]]

In 2003, Hooper published additional statements that he believed supported his hypothesis in an article in the ''[[London Review of Books]]''. These included accounts of an interview with Jacques Kanyama, a virology technician at the lab in Stanleyville (the Laboratoire Médical de Stanleyville (LMS)) responsible for testing the CHAT vaccine and performing the initial set of vaccinations, who was reported to have said that batches of CHAT had been produced on site by Paul Osterrieth. In addition, Philip Elebe, a microbiology technician, was claimed to have said that tissue cultures were being produced from Lindi chimpanzees. Osterrieth has denied these claims and stated that this work would not have been possible in this laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Osterrieth PM |authorlink=Paul Osterrieth |title=Vaccine could not have been prepared in Stanleyville |journal=Philos.

{{Quotation|at no time did I ever attempt to make cell cultures from chimpanzee tissues. In addition, I wish to state categorically that no poliovaccine was ever produced or could have been produced in Stanleyville, since the facilities were totally inadequate for the production or control of poliovaccine.&lt;ref name=PlotkinSA/&gt;}}

In his book, Hooper also stated that Gaston Ninane was involved in using chimpanzee cells to produce vaccine in Congo. Ninane responded to this allegation by stating that he could "categorically deny" ever having tried to make tissue cultures from chimpanzee cells.&lt;ref name=Plotkin/&gt; The people involved in vaccine production and distribution from America state that no vaccine was prepared locally in Congo and that only the CHAT vaccine from America was used. Barbara Cohen, the technician who was responsible for running the American laboratory that produced this vaccine stated:

{{Quotation|At no time did I ever receive or work on chimpanzee kidneys, nor to my knowledge cells derived from chimpanzees. I never made, nor do I know of anyone in the lab who made polio vaccine in chimpanzee cells.&lt;ref name=PlotkinSA&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plotkin SA |title=Untruths and consequences: the false hypothesis linking CHAT type 1 polio vaccination to the origin of human immunodeficiency virus |journal=Philos.

== Scientific investigation ==
The OPV AIDS hypothesis has been examined and rejected by the scientific and medical communities as being unsupported or directly contradicted by available data, and inconsistent with HIV [[epidemiology]].

In an August 1992 letter published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Koprowski repudiated the OPV AIDS hypothesis, pointing to multiple errors of fact in its assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koprowski |title=AIDS and the Polio Vaccine |journal=Science |volume=257 |issue=5073 |pages=1024–1027 |year=1992 |doi=10.1126/science.257.5073.1024 |pmid=1509249}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1992, ''Science'' ran a story titled "Panel Nixes Congo Vaccine as AIDS source," describing the findings of an independent panel which found each proposed step in the OPV-AIDS hypothesis "problematic". The story concluded:
{{Quotation|...it can be stated with almost complete certainty that the large polio vaccine trial... was not the origin of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Panel nixes Congo trials as AIDS source |journal=Science |volume=258 |issue=5083 |pages=738–9 |year=1992 |pmid=1439779 | doi=10.1126/science.258.5083.738-d  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The oldest confirmed sample of human tissue that shows the presence of HIV-1 is an archival sample of plasma collected from an anonymous donor in the city of Leopoldville, Belgian Congo (now [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) in 1959 and was found with retrospective genetic analysis to be most closely related to subtype D strains. In 2008, partial HIV viral sequences were identified from a specimen of lymph node collected from an adult female, also in Kinshasa, in 1960. This specimen, named DRC60, was around 88% similar to ZR59, but was found to be most closely related to subtype A HIV-1 strains. These specimens are significant not only because they are the oldest specimens of the virus known to cause AIDS, but because they show that the virus already had an extensive amount of genetic diversity in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Worobey M, Gemmel M, Teuwen DE, Haselkorn T, Kunstman K, Bunce M, Muyembe JJ, Kabongo JM, Kalengayi RM, Van Marck E, Gilbert MT, Wolinsky SM. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18833279 Direct evidence of extensive diversity of HIV-1 in Kinshasa by 1960.] Nature. 2008 Oct 2;455(7213):661-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[Royal Society]] held a meeting to discuss data on the [[AIDS origin|origin of AIDS]]; the OPV AIDS hypothesis was a central topic of discussion. At this meeting, three independent labs released the results of tests on the remaining stocks of Koprowski's vaccine, which Edward Hooper had demanded in ''The River''. The tests confirmed Koprowski's contention that his vaccine was made from monkey, rather than chimpanzee, kidney, and found no evidence of SIV or HIV contamination. Additional epidemiologic and phylogenetic data was presented at the conference which undermined other aspects of the OPV AIDS hypothesis. According to a report in ''Science'',&lt;ref name="cohen0"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.sciencemag.org/2000/09/vaccine-theory-aids-takes-blow|title= Vaccine Theory of AIDS Takes a Blow|last1= Cohen|first1= Jon|last2= |first2= |date= 12 September 2000|website= Science|access-date= November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooper "did not challenge the results; he simply dismissed them."

The author of one of the studies, [[evolutionary biologist]] Edward Holmes of [[Oxford University]], commented in light of the new evidence: "Hooper's evidence was always flimsy, and now it's untenable.

{{Quotation|The new data may not convince the hardened conspiracy theorist who thinks that contamination of OPV by chimpanzee virus was subsequently and deliberately covered up.

The possibility that chimpanzees found near Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Stanleyville) were, indirectly, the true source of HIV-1 was directly addressed in a 2004 study published in ''Nature''. Here, the authors found that while SIV was present in chimpanzees in the area, the strain of SIV infecting these chimpanzees was [[phylogeny|phylogenetically]] distinct from all strains of HIV, providing direct evidence that these particular chimps were not the source of HIV in humans.&lt;ref name="worobey"/&gt;

== Current oral polio-vaccine campaign in Africa ==
Rumours that polio vaccines are unsafe disrupted the longstanding effort of the [[WHO]] and [[UN]] to achieve [[poliomyelitis eradication]] worldwide through use of the oral polio vaccine of [[Albert Sabin]], which is thought to be safe and effective by virtually all medical authorities. If this long-term public-health goal could be achieved, [[poliomyelitis]] would follow [[smallpox]] as the second eradicated infectious human disease. The OPV AIDS hypothesis relates only to the historical origin of AIDS, and its proponents have accepted the safety of the modern polio vaccines, but rumors based on a misunderstanding of the hypothesis exist,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2070634.stm Nigeria Muslims oppose polio vaccination] ''BBC News'' 27 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/20/international/asia/20polio.html?pagewanted=2 Rumor, Fear and Fatigue Hinder Final Push to End Polio] Celia W. Dugger and Donald G. McNeil Jr. ''New York Times'' 20 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and those rumors are blamed in part for the recent failure to eliminate polio in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name=Jegede&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jegede AS |title=What led to the Nigerian boycott of the polio vaccination campaign? |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e73 |year=2007 |pmid=17388657 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040073 |pmc=1831725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2003, cases of poliomyelitis had been reduced to just a small number in isolated regions of [[West Africa]], with sporadic cases elsewhere.  However, the disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other nations of Africa, which epidemiologists trace to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to be administered the Sabin oral vaccine. The expressed concerns of local populations often relate to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;BBC News (2005) "Anti-polio vaccine Malians jailed" [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4539757.stm online]&lt;/ref&gt; and it seems that debate over the OPV-AIDS hypothesis has fueled additional fears.&lt;ref name=Hooper1&gt;Cohen, Jon (2000) ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' (Oct), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003, these fears have spread among some in the Muslim community, with Datti Ahmed, of the Supreme Council for Sharia in Nigeria stating that:

{{quotation|“We believe that modern-day Hitlers have deliberately adulterated the oral polio vaccines with anti-fertility drugs and viruses which are known to cause HIV and AIDS.”&lt;ref name=Jegede/&gt;}}

Polio has also resurged in areas of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=GPEI&gt;[[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] (2007) Map of last six months of polio cases worldwide ''Wild Poliovirus Weekly Update'' initiative of WHO, CDC, UNICEF, Rotary International [http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casemap.shtml online] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060925/http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casemap.shtml |date=25 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;BBC News (2007) "Bangladesh begins new polio drive" [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6412835.stm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Rainworth Fort''' a.k.a. '''Old Rainworth Stone Store''' a.k.a.'''Rainworth Head Station Store''' is a fortified [[Blockhouse]] 10&amp;nbsp;km south of the town of [[Springsure, Queensland]]. The fort has been registered with the Queensland heritage register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://environment.ehp.qld.gov.au/heritage-register/detail/?id=600026 |title=Heritage register entry &amp;#124; Environment, land and water &amp;#124; Queensland Government |publisher=Environment.ehp.qld.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It served as a store for the local community, and was built from local stone in case of an attack by local [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] tribes during the time that would later be called the [[Australian frontier wars]].

==History==
The fort was built on the Rainworth Station in 1862 to act as a store for food for all of the staff and families of the 100,000-acre cattle property.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-28/nrn-rainworth-fort/5819250 |title=History of Old Rainworth Fort lives on thanks to Springsure sisters - ABC Rural (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2014-10-28 |accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The store was built out of stone in order to reduce threats of fire and to act as a safe haven during an Aboriginal raid. The fort was constructed in retaliation of the Wills family massacre, more commonly known as the [[Cullin-la-ringo massacre|Wills Tragedy]] that took place to the north of Springsure, in the Minerva hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outbacknow.com.au/index.php/tours/detail/queensland/capricorn_burnett/springsure/old_rainworth_fort |title=Old Rainworth Fort |publisher=Outbacknow.com.au |date= |accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum==
The museum complex contains the Fort in its original condition, the relocated Cairdbeign homestead and the original school building from the 1800s. The museum contains many period pieces and artefacts of local importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.queensland.com/destination%20information/Springsure |title=Springsure - Destination Information |publisher=Queensland |date= |accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to the current caretakers of the fort, Colleen McLaughlin and her sister Lorna Smith, the future of the Historic site is unsure:

{{quote|"The most common comment that we have in our (visitors) book is the preservation of the history in this district," Ms McLaughlin said.

"This is not just a stone building in the backyard of Springsure. There is nothing like it anywhere else anywhere in Australia

"We have people who have signed it, saying this is an icon this must be preserved.

"The future's the $64,000 question... the whole area is national heritage and I just hope somewhere along the line a trust will be formed."}}&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

'''Othon Riemann''' (13 June 1853, in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] – 16 August 1891, in [[Interlaken]]) was a French [[classical philologist]] and [[archaeologist]].

He studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS) in [[Paris]], and in 1874 became a member of the [[École française d'Athènes]] (French School of Athens). While a member, he visited various libraries in Italy, during which he collated manuscripts of [[Livy]]. He then conducted archaeological research of the [[Ionian Islands]], about which, he produced a massive report. After returning to France, he taught classes in [[grammar]] in his hometown of Nancy.&lt;ref name=BI&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VYnPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=%22Othon+Riemann%22+1853&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bvkGfP_VZA&amp;sig=H2vzcFtYAOmlBxGFQIJp1rR2GYg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8r9yD3cDKAhVJVz4KHcsuAUg4ChDoAQgoMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Othon%20Riemann%22%201853&amp;f=false American Journal of Philology, Volume 15] edited by Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve, Charles William Emil Miller, Tenney Frank, Benjamin Dean Meritt, Henry Thompson Rowell, Harold Fredrik Cherniss&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880 he became an editor of the "''Revue de philologie, de littérature et d'histoire anciennes''", and during the following year, attained the chair of grammar at the École Normale Supérieure. From 1885 he taught classes at the [[École pratique des hautes études]], while still maintaining his post at the ENS. He died on August 16, 1871 (age 38) from the effects of a fall on the Morgenberg, located near [[Interlaken]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name=BI/&gt;

'''Paul-François Groussac''' (February 15, 1848 – June 27, 1929) was a [[France|French]]-born [[Argentina|Argentine]] writer, [[literary criticism|literary critic]], historian, and librarian. He was born in [[Toulouse]] to Catherine Deval and Pierre Groussac, the scion of an old [[Languedoc]]ian family.

==Biography==
As a young man, Groussac studied classics in his native Toulouse. He was admitted to the [[École Navale]] in 1865, but chose not to pursue a naval career. The next year he moved to [[Buenos Aires]], which would remain his home for the rest of his life. Over the next seventeen years, he worked as a professor, directed the [[Normal school|Escuela Normal]] de [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]], and served as inspector general of the national colleges. In 1883 he made a trip to France. After his return, in 1885, he was designated inspector of education and head of the [[Biblioteca Nacional de la República Argentina|Biblioteca Nacional]]. He would hold this position until his death forty-four years later.

His most notable works are ''La Biblioteca'' (1896) and ''Anales de la Biblioteca'' (1900), which were anthologies of critical essays, historical accounts of the library, and documents pertaining to the history of the [[Río de la Plata]] region. As director of the literary journal ''SudAmérica'', Groussac became a central figure in the Argentine literary world. His works, including ''Studies of Argentine History'', ''Historical Essay on Tucumán'', and ''Mendoza and Garay'', are characterized by their factual richness, vivid depiction of characters and their environment, and their lucid and conscientious style. Groussac's other main works include ''Forbidden Fruit'', ''Argentine Tales'', ''The Divisa Punzó'', and ''Literary Criticism and the Malvinas  Islands''.

Groussac's posthumous reputation was bolstered by his frequent mention in the critical essays of fellow Argentine librarian [[Jorge Luis Borges]], who also wrote his [[obituary]]. In his autobiographical essay ''La Ceguera'' ("Blindness"), Borges spoke of Groussac's influence on [[Alfonso Reyes]], whom he held in great esteem: "Alfonso Reyes, the greatest prose writer in the Spanish language of any age, said to me: 'Groussac, who was French, taught me how to write in Spanish'". (''Siete Noches''. Fondo de Cultura Economica, Mexico, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;156.) As a critic, he was notorious for his ruthless and intractable temperament, and for his withering mordancy. Borges analyzed some of Groussac's literary insults in his 1933 ''[[Sur (magazine)|Sur]]'' essay ''Arte de injuriar'' (translated as "The Art of Verbal Abuse").

Groussac and Borges shared a few biographical parallels as well: between 1955 and 1973, Borges occupied Groussac's old position at the Biblioteca Nacional. Both men also suffered from poor eyesight, and both were completely [[blindness|blind]] by the end of their respective tenures as chief librarian.

'''Raphael Holinshed''' ({{circa|1525}}–1580?) was an English [[chronicle]]r, whose work, commonly known as ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles]]'' (first edition 1577; second edition 1587), was one of the major sources used by [[William Shakespeare]] for a number of [[Shakespeare's plays|his plays]].
 
==Biography==
Holinshed was the son of Ralph Holinshed or Hollingshead of Cophurst in the township of Sutton Downes (near [[Pott Shrigley]]), [[Cheshire]]. He lived in London, where he worked as a translator for the printer [[Reyner Wolfe]].&lt;ref&gt;Clegg 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe gave him the project of compiling a world history from [[Genesis flood narrative|the Flood]] to the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]. This ambitious project was never finished, but one portion was published in 1577 as ''The Chronicles of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]''. Holinshed was only one contributor to this work; others involved in its production included [[William Harrison (priest)|William Harrison]], [[Richard Stanyhurst]], and [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]].

Shakespeare used the revised second edition of the ''Chronicles'' (published in 1587) as the source for most of his [[Shakespearean history|history plays]], the plot of ''[[Macbeth]]'', and for portions of ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''[[Cymbeline]]''.

Little is known of Holinshed's life. There is no source which states his date of birth, for instance. He became known only by the ''Chronicles'', and most of the information we have about him relates to this work. Although Vernon Snow remarks that Holinshed was an experienced Cambridge-educated translator, no other works by Holinshed are available. A few months after the Chronicle had been licensed, Holinshed retired to the countryside near Warwick. He died around 1580 and his will was proved on 24 April 1582. Nothing is known about Holinshed's civil duties, other scholarly achievements or work for the Church.

== Holinshed's ''Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland'' ==
{{main|Holinshed's Chronicles}}
[[File:1577 printing of Holinshed's Chronicles.jpg|thumb|First edition of Holinshed's ''Chronicles'']]
In 1548 Reyner Wolfe, a London printer, conceived the idea of creating a "Universal Cosmography of the whole world, and there with also certain particular histories of every known nation." He wanted the work to be printed in English and he wanted maps and illustrations in the book as well. Wolfe acquired many of [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]]'s works and with these he constructed chronologies and drew maps that were up to date. When Wolfe realised he could not complete this project on his own, he hired Raphael Holinshed and William Harrison to assist him.
 
Wolfe died with the work still uncompleted in 1573, and the project, changed to a work about just the British Isles, was run by a consortium of three members of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|London stationers]].  They kept Raphael Holinshed who employed [[William Harrison (priest)|William Harrison]], [[Richard Stanyhurst]], [[Edmund Campion]] and [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]]. In 1577 the work was published in two volumes after some censorship by the [[Privy Council]] of some of Stanyhurst's contribution on Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/iss/library/speccoll/bomarch/bomfeb05.html  (King's College London) Holinshed's ''Chronicles''] February 2005. Retrieved 1 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish section is largely a translation of [[Hector Boece]]'s ''Scotorum Historiae''&lt;ref name="outline"&gt;J. A. Hammerton, Outline of Great Books, New York, Wise &amp; Co. (1937)&lt;/ref&gt;

A second edition was issued in 1587, but it contained some passages that were considered offensive to the Queen and her ministers. The pages in question were removed by order of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].  The missing passages were separately published in 1723, and a complete reprint appeared in 1807.&lt;ref name="outline" /&gt;

'''Red Bay''' is a [[fishing village]] in [[Labrador]], notable as one of the most precious [[underwater archaeology|underwater archaeological]] sites in the Americas. Between 1530 and the early 17th century, it was a major [[History of Basque whaling|Basque whaling]] area. Several [[whaling ship]]s, both large [[galleons]] and small ''[[Chalupa (boat)|chalupas]]'', sunk there, and their discovery led to the designation of Red Bay in 2013 as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Geography ==
Red Bay is a natural harbour residing in the bay that gives it its name, both names in reference to the red granite cliffs of the region. Because of the sheltered harbour it was used during World War II as a mooring site for naval vessels. In the bay are Penney Island and Saddle Island, which were used by the [[Basques]] for their whaling operations. The location of the sunken vessel [[San Juan (ship)|''San Juan'']] is near Saddle Island.

== History ==
{{See also|History of Basque whaling#Newfoundland and Labrador}}
[[Image:RedBayNL_BasqueChalupa.JPG|thumb|left|A Basque ''chalupa'' recovered from the waters of the bay and on display in the museum.]]

Between 1550 and the early 17th century, Red Bay, known as ''Balea Baya'' (Whale Bay), was a centre for [[Basque people|Basque]] whaling operations. [[Sailor]]s from southern [[France]] and northern [[Spain]] sent 15 whaleships and 600 men a season to the remote outpost on the [[Strait of Belle Isle]] to try to catch the [[right whale]] and [[bowhead whale]]s that populated the waters there, according to [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]].

In 1565, a ship—believed to be [[San Juan (ship)|''San Juan'']]—sank in the waters off Red Bay during a storm. Other, smaller vessels, such as chalupas, have also been recovered from the waters.

Another [[galleon]] was found 25–35 feet below water in 2004. It was the fourth trans-oceanic ship to have been found in the area.

A [[cemetery]] on nearby Saddle Island holds the remains of 140 whalers. Many of the people buried there are thought to have died from drowning and exposure.

Historians{{Who|June 2013|date=June 2013}} believe that a decline in whale stocks eventually led to the abandonment of the whaling stations in Red Bay. Today, an interpretive centre in Red Bay explains the history to visitors.

Local legends of Red Bay make reference to a hidden treasure buried in a body of water known as ''Pond on the Hill'' {{coord|51|43|43|N|56|26|56|W|scale:25000}} at the foot of Tracey Hill by the infamous pirate Captain [[William Kidd]]. An attempt was made to find the treasure by residents of [[Carrol Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador|Carrol Cove]] by draining the pond. The attempt had failed.

Red Bay has been designated a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] since 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|14409|Red Bay|14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since 2013 it is one of [[List of World Heritage Sites in Canada|Canada's UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1412 |title= Red Bay Basque Whaling Station |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= Unesco World Heritage List |access-date= 18 July 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Regius Professor]] of History''' at the [[University of Oxford]] is a long-established professorial position.&lt;ref&gt;Originally the Regius Professor of Modern History, the ''Modern'' was dropped in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2339">The '''Simone and Cino Del Duca Foundation''' is a [[Foundation (charity)|charitable foundation]] based in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It was established in 1975 by [[Simone Del Duca]] (1912–2004), widow of publishing magnate [[Cino Del Duca]] (1899–1967). The Foundation took over responsibility for the existing [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]] created by Madame Del Duca in 1969.

The Foundation has been a substantial and important contributor to the [[arts]] in France and humanities [[world]]wide. It has provided very significant support for scientific research, in particular for [[medical research|biomedical research]] and including [[oncology]], [[biochemistry]], and [[molecular genetics]]. The Foundation has funded a Fellowship for such things as a Postdoctoral for Studies in [[Neurobiology]] and funding for [[breast cancer]] research for organizations such as the [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]]. As well, the "Simone and Cino Del Duca Foundation on Cancer Pharmacotherapy" paid for and published the 1983 book: ''Current Drugs And Methods of Cancer Treatment'' ([[Masson Pub. USA]] {{ISBN|0-89352-201-5}})

The Simone and Cino Del Duca Foundation provides two major [[arts]] prizes through the French [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]]. A prize in [[music]] is awarded annually plus one that is given on an alternating basis to [[painting|painters]] and [[sculpture|sculptors]]. In addition, the Foundation helped fund the major restoration of the collections of the [[Musée Condé]] at [[Chantilly, Oise]].

The Foundation also gives a prize in [[archaeology]], intended to help with archaeology projects in France or abroad.

Following the death of Madame Del Duca in 2004, administration of the Foundation has been assumed by the [[Institut de France]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2443">'''Susan Hogan''' (born 1961) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[cultural historian]]. Hogan is Professor in Cultural Studies &amp; Art Therapy at the [[University of Derby]], where she facilitates the closed-group component of the [[art therapy]] training, and co-ordinates the final thesis or research project component of a number of programmes.

== Personal life ==
Hogan married Philip Douglas in 1988, and then divorced in 1998. Hogan's mother-in-law was noted anthropologist Dame [[Mary Douglas]].  She has two children: Emile and Eilish.

== Career ==
Hogan attended a school based on the doctrine of [[A.S. Neill]]’s [[Summerhill School]]. This experience, coupled with the anthropological work of her mother-in-law, influenced her work.

She started her Ph.D. at the University of Sydney in art history and finished it in cultural history at the [[Thomas Reid]] Institute of the [[University of Aberdeen]], where [[G.S. Rousseau]] served as her primary supervisor.

She has taught in a number of universities including the [[University of New South Wales]] and University of Derby.

Hogan's work has focused on therapy with: women of ageing and women who have recently given birth, offering art therapy groups to give support to woman and an opportunity for them to explore their changed sense of self-identity and sexuality as a result of pregnancy and motherhood. Her published work is significant in its sustained challenge to the use of reductive psychology and for bringing anthropological and sociological ideas to bear on the subject of art therapy.

In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States' [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]], being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Synopsis==
The film covers the beginnings of the era of [[nuclear warfare]], created from a broad range of archival material from the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s including newsreel clips, television news footage, U.S. government-produced films (including military [[training film]]s), advertisements, television and radio programs. News footage reflected the prevailing understanding of the media and public.

Though the topic of atomic holocaust is a grave matter, ''The Atomic Cafe'' approaches it with [[black comedy|black humor]]. Much of the humor derives from the modern audience's reaction to the old training films, such as the ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'' film shown in schools.  A quote to illustrate what can be perceived as black humor, culled from the movie:  "Viewed from a safe distance, the atomic bomb is one of the most beautiful sights ever seen by man," a U.S. Army training film declares.

== Historical context ==
''The Atomic Cafe'' was released at the height of nostalgia and cynicism in America. By 1982, Americans lost much of their faith in their government following the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Watergate scandal]], and the seemingly never-ending [[arms race]] with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20686938?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101424275191 McLane Betsy]. "Film Quarterly", film review, Spring 1983. Last accessed: November 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Atomic Cafe'' reflects and reinforces this idea as it exposes how the atomic bomb's dangers were downplayed   (President Truman calls the atomic bomb a gift from God) and how the government used films to shape public opinion.

''The Atomic Cafe'' was also released during the Reagan Administration's forced civil defense revival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conelrad.com/jayne_loader.html ''Conelrad: All Things Atomic'']. ''The Atomic Cafe'', Jayne Loader Interview.  Last accessed: November 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Posen and Stephen Van Evera explain this revival in their article "Defense Policy and the Reagan Administration: Departure from Containment" published in ''International Security''. They argue that in 1981–82 the Reagan Administration was moving from an essentially defensive grand strategy of containment to a more offensive strategy.  Due to the greater demands of its more offensive strategy "the Reagan Administration ... proposed the biggest military buildup since the Korean War."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2538484?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101424275191 Posen, R. Barry] "Defense Policy and the Reagan Administration: Departure from Containment", Journal article. Last accessed: November 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Of key relevance to ''The Atomic Cafe'', the Reagan move toward offense included the adoption of a more aggressive nuclear strategy that required a large U.S. nuclear buildup.  Containment only required that U.S. strategic nuclear forces be capable of one mission: inflicting unacceptable damage on the Soviet Union even after absorbing an all-out Soviet surprise attack.  To this "assured destruction" mission the Reagan administration added a second "counterforce" mission, which required the capacity to launch a nuclear first strike against Soviet strategic nuclear forces that would leave the Soviets unable to inflict unacceptable damage on the U.S. in retaliation.  The U.S. had always invested in counterforce but the Reagan administration put even greater emphasis on it.  The counterforce mission was far more demanding than the assured destruction mission, and required a vast expansion of U.S. nuclear forces to fulfill.  Civil defense was a component of a counterforce strategy, as it reduced Soviet retaliatory capacity, hence civil defense was a candidate for more spending under Reagan's counterforce nuclear strategy.  Posen and Van Evera argue that this counterforce strategy was a warrant for an open-ended U.S. nuclear buildup.

Bob Mielke, in "Rhetoric and Ideology in the Nuclear Test Documentary" (''Film Quarterly'') discusses the release of ''The Atomic Cafe'':  "This satire feature was released at the height of the nuclear freeze movement (which was in turn responding to the Reagan administration's surreal handling of the arms race.)"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1525/fq.2005.58.3.28?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101424275191 Mielke Bob].

Patricia Aufderheide, in "Documentary Film : A Very Short Introduction" touches on the significance of ''The Atomic Cafe'' as a window into the past of government propaganda and disinformation during the years following the advent of the Atomic Bomb. "Propaganda, also known as disinformation, public diplomacy, and strategic communication, continues to be an important tool for governments. But stand-alone documentary is no longer an important part of public relations campaigns aimed at the general public."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Documentary-Film-Very-Short-Introduction/dp/0195182707|title=Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction|last=Aufderheide|first=Patricia|date=November 2007|website=|publisher=Oxford University Press; 7th edition|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''The Atomic Cafe'' was produced over a five-year period through the collaborative efforts of three directors: Jayne Loader and brothers Kevin and Pierce Rafferty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = THEY TURNED OLD MOVIES INTO A TIMELY FILM ABOUT NUCLEAR WAR|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/16/movies/they-turned-old-movies-into-a-timely-film-about-nuclear-war.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1982-05-16|access-date = 2015-11-23|issn = 0362-4331|first = Robin|last = Herman}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this film, the Rafferty brothers and Loader formed a production company called The Archives Project. The filmmakers opted not to use narration.  Instead, they deployed carefully constructed sequences of film clips to make their points. Jayne Loader has referred to ''The Atomic Cafe'' as "compilation verite":  a compilation film with no "Voice of God" narration and no new footage added by the filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conelrad.com/jayne_loader.html ''Conelrad: All Things Atomic'']. ''The Atomic Cafe'', Jayne Loader Interview.  Last accessed: February 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack utilizes atomic-themed songs from the [[Cold War]] era to underscore the themes of the film.&lt;ref name="Canby, Vincent"&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E06E3D71038F934A25750C0A964948260 Canby, Vincent].  ''The New York Times'', film review, March 17, 1982.  Last accessed: February 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film cost $300,000 to make. The group did receive some financial support from outside sources, including the Film Fund, a New York City based non-profit.&lt;ref&gt;Trebbe, Ann L. "Cinema Verties." The Washington Post 6 Nov. 1981, C3 sec.&lt;/ref&gt; Grants comprised a nominal amount of the team's budget, and the film was largely funded by the filmmakers themselves. Jayne Loader stated in an interview, "Had we relied on grants, we would have starved" &lt;ref name="conelrad.com"&gt;[http://www.conelrad.com/jayne_loader.html] ''The Atomic Cafe, Jayne Loader Interview''. Last accessed: November 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Pierce Rafferty helped to support the team and the film financially by working as a consultant and researcher on several other documentary films including ''El Salvador—Another Vietnam'', ''With Babies and Banners'', and ''The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter''.&lt;ref name="Harrington, Richard 1982"&gt;Harrington, Richard. "Blast from the Past: 'Atomic Cafe': A Stunning Cold War Collage." The Washington Post 14 May 1982, C1 sec.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rafferty brothers had also received an inheritance that they used to support the team during the five years it took to make the film.&lt;ref name="conelrad.com"/&gt; About 75% of the film is made up of government materials that were in the public domain. Though they could use those public domain materials for free, they had to make copies of the films at their own expense. This along with the newsreel and commercial stock footage that comprises the other 25% of the film (along with the music royalties) represents the bulk of the trio's expenditures.&lt;ref name="Harrington, Richard 1982"/&gt;

==Release==
The film was released on March 17, 1982 in New York, New York.  In August 1982, a tie-in companion book of the same name, written by Kevin Rafferty, Jayne Loader and Pierce Rafferty was released by [[Bantam Books]]. A 4K digital restoration of the film premiered at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] in 2018.&lt;ref name="Epstein"/&gt;

The 20th Anniversary Edition of the film was released in DVD format in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] on March 26, 2002 by New Video Group.&lt;ref name="Amazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/ref&gt; The 4K restored version will be released on Blu-ray December 4, 2018 by [[Kino Lorber]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=24068 Kino: 4K Restoration of The Atomic Cafe Detailed for Blu-ray]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Atomic-Cafe-Blu-ray/210264/ The Atomic Café Blu-ray]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, ''Jayne Loader's'' ''Public Shelter'', an educational [[CD-ROM]] and Website''--''with clips from ''The Atomic Cafe'', plus additional material from declassified films, audio, photographs, and text files that archive the history, technology, and culture of the [[Nuclear Age]]—was released by EJL Productions, a company formed by Jayne Loader and her first husband, Eric Schwaab.  Though it garnered positive national reviews and awards, the self-distributed ''Public Shelter'' CD-ROM sold only 500 copies and failed to find a national publisher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasobserver.com/1996-06-27/news/ground-zero/2/ Wen, Howard].

==Reception==

===Critical response===
When ''The Atomic Cafe'' was released, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] discussed the style and methods the filmmakers used, writing, "The makers of ''The Atomic Cafe'' sifted through thousands of feet of Army films, newsreels, government propaganda films and old television broadcasts to come up with the material in their film, which is presented without any narration, as a record of some of the ways in which the bomb entered American folklore. There are songs, speeches politicians, and frightening documentary footage of guinea-pig American troops shielding themselves from an atomic blast and then exposing themselves to radiation neither they nor their officers understood."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19820101/REVIEWS/60530001/1023 Ebert, Roger].  ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', film review, January 1, 1982.  Last accessed: February 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Vincent Canby]] of the ''New York Times'' praised the film, calling the film "a devastating collage-film that examines official and unofficial United States attitudes toward the atomic age" and a film that "deserves national attention."&lt;ref name="Canby, Vincent"/&gt;  Canby was so taken by ''The Atomic Cafe'' that he mentioned it in a subsequent articles—comparing it, favorably, to the blockbuster ''[[Porky's]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = FILM VIEW; PONDERING REAL CONCERNS OF THE 1950'S|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/25/movies/film-view-pondering-real-concerns-of-the-1950-s.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1982-04-25|access-date = 2015-11-23|issn = 0362-4331|first = Vincent|last = Canby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, critic [[Glenn Erickson]] discussed the editorial message of the film's producers: "The makers of ''The Atomic Cafe'' clearly have a message to get across, and to achieve that goal they use the inherent absurdity of their source material in creative ways. But they're careful to make sure they leave them essentially untransformed. When we see [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]] and [[J. Edgar Hoover]] posing with a strip of microfilm, we know we're watching a newsreel. The content isn't cheated. Except in wrapup montages, narration from one source isn't used over another. When raw footage is available, candid moments are seen of speechmakers (including [[Harry S Truman|President Truman]]) when they don't know the cameras are rolling. Caught laughing incongruously before a solemn report on an atom threat, Truman comes off not as callous, but human."

The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 100% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 14 reviews."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/atomic_cafe/ ''The Atomic Cafe''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]].  Last accessed: February 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deirdre Boyle, an Associate Professor and Academic Coordinator of the Graduate Certificate in Documentary Media Studies at [[The New School]] and an author of ''Subject to Change: Guerrilla Television Revisited'', claimed that "By compiling propaganda or fictions denying 'nuclear-truth', ''The'' ''Atomic Cafe'' reveals the American public's lack of resistance to the fear generated by the government propaganda films and the misinformation they generated. Whether Americans of the time lacked the ability to resist or reject this misinformation about the atomic bomb is a debatable truth."&lt;ref name="Boyle"&gt;Boyle, Deirdre, "The Atomic Cafe", Cineaste 12.2, 1982, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is referred to as a both a "[[mockumentary]]" and a documentary by ''Horror View'', which likewise makes parallels between it and the surrealist humor and cynicism found in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horrorview.com/movie-reviews/atomic-cafe-the Horror View: Atomic Cafe, The]&lt;/ref&gt; The Oxford Handbook of Science Fiction said it was, in quotes, a "mockumentary" from its editing and called it, "The most powerful satire of the official treatments of the atomic age".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NI4dBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA342&amp;lpg=PA342&amp;dq=%22atomic+cafe%22+mockumentary|title=The Oxford Handbook of Science Fiction|last=Latham|first=Rob|date=2014-09-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199838851|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2623">'''Theatre practitioner''' is a modern term to describe someone who both creates [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]]s and who produces a [[theory|theoretical]] [[discourse]] that informs his or her practical work.&lt;ref&gt;Milling and Ley (2001, vi, 173) and Pavis (1998, 280). {{lang-de|Theaterpraktiker}}, {{lang-fr|praticien}}, {{lang-es|teatrista}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A theatre practitioner may be a [[Theatre director|director]], a [[dramatist]], an [[actor]], or—characteristically—often a combination of these traditionally-separate roles. "Theatre practice" describes the collective work that various theatre practitioners do.&lt;ref&gt;Pavis (1998, 392).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is not ordinarily applied to theatre-makers prior to the rise of [[modernism]] in the theatre, instead describing theatre [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] from [[Constantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]]'s development of his '[[Stanislavski's 'system'|system]]', through [[Vsevolod Meyerhold|Meyerhold]]'s [[Biomechanics (Meyerhold)|biomechanics]], [[Antonin Artaud]]'s [[Theatre of cruelty]], [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s [[Epic theatre|epic]] and [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s [[poor theatre]], down to the present day, with contemporary theatre practitioners including [[Augusto Boal]] with his [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], [[Dario Fo]]'s popular theatre, [[Eugenio Barba]]'s theatre anthropology and [[Anne Bogart]]'s [[viewpoints]].&lt;ref&gt;McCullough (1996, 15-36) and Milling and Ley (2001, vii, 175).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tom Segev''' ({{lang-he|תום שגב}}; born March 1, 1945) is an Israeli historian, author and journalist. He is associated with Israel's [[New Historians]], a group challenging many of the country's traditional narratives.

==Biography==
Tom Segev was born in [[Jerusalem]] to parents who had fled Nazi Germany in 1933. He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in history and political science from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in history from [[Boston University]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people4/Segev/segev-con1.html Conversation with Tom Segev, p. 1 of 7&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism career==
Segev worked during the 1970s as a correspondent for [[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]] in Bonn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1081754.html I didn't have the guts, Haaretz, April 28, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a visiting professor at [[Rutgers University]] (2001–2002),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/books/int/2001/12/08/palestine Salon.com Books | Beyond tribalism]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of California at Berkeley]] (2007)&lt;ref&gt;[http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people7/Segev/segev07-con0.html Conversation with Tom Segev (2007), cover page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Northeastern University]], where he taught a course on [[Holocaust denial]]. He writes a weekly column for the newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]''. His books have appeared in fourteen languages.

In ''The Seventh Million: The Israelis and the Holocaust'' (1993), Segev explores the decisive impact of the Holocaust on the identity, ideology and politics of Israel. Although controversial, it was praised by [[Elie Wiesel]] in the ''Los Angeles Times'' Book Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Elie Wiesel |title=The Land That Broke Its Promise THE SEVENTH MILLION: The Israelis and the Holocaust, By Tom Segev |articletype=Book Review |journal=LA Times |journal.= |edition= |journalformat=Internet |date=1992 |update= |archiveurl= |archivedate=1997 |accessdate=2010-04-18 |volume= |issue= |pages= |language=English |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/282068355.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate'', a ''New York Times'' Editor's Choice Best Book (2000) and a recipient of the National Jewish Book Award, Segev describes the era of the British Mandate in Palestine (1917–1948). 

Segev's history of the social and political background of the [[Six-Day War]], ''1967: Israel, the War, and the Year That Transformed the Middle East'' (2006) states that there was no existential threat to Israel from a military point of view. Segev also doubts that the Arab neighbours would have really attacked Israel. Still, there were large segments of the Israeli population that had a real fear that the Egyptians and Syrians would eliminate them. This would have increased the pressure for the Israeli government in such a way that it opted for a preemptive attack. The attack by the Jordanian army to West Jerusalem would have provided a welcoming reason to invade East Jerusalem, according to Segev. Even though the occupation of East Jerusalem was not politically planned, the author considers it was always desired. In February 2018 Segev published a biography of David Ben-Gurion.

==Praise and criticism==
The book "Israel, the War, and the Year That Transformed the Middle East" has been described by the historian [[Saul Friedländer]] as "probably the best book on those most fateful days in the history of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.de/1967-Israel-Year-Transformed-Middle/dp/product-description/0805070575 ''1967: Israel, the War, and the Year That Transformed the Middle East''], by Tom Segev.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethan Bronner]] in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' wrote: "It does not tell the whole story of the war, barely focusing on Arab activity... What interests Mr. Segev is Israel: its moods, debates, generation gaps and anxieties" and that "You need not agree with Mr. Segev’s conclusions on how things could have been done differently to benefit from his research and narrative. If you plan to read only one book on the 1967 war, this is not it. It is too narrowly focused. At the same time Mr. Segev makes a compelling and fresh case that the war was at least partly a result of a delicate and vulnerable moment in Israeli history" and that Segev's exploration "is — while too long — persuasive and engaging".&lt;ref&gt;Ethan Bronner, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/18/books/18bron.html?pagewanted=all Holding a Mirror Up to Israeli Destiny, the Past and the Prologue], ''The New York Times'', 18 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[L. Carl Brown]] wrote in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' "The author of One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate has written another masterful history" in a review of Segev's book ''1967: Israel, the War, and the Year That Transformed the Middle East''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/62788/l-carl-brown/1967-israel-the-war-and-the-year-that-transformed-the-middle-eas 1967: Israel, the War, and the Year That Transformed the Middle East], L. Carl Brown, ''Foreign Affairs''&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''International Socialist Review'' (a paper "dedicated to advancing socialist theory and practice"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the International Socialist Review|url=https://isreview.org/about|publisher=ISR|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hadas Thier found the 688-page book "at times a tediously detailed read with thin analysis" but called it "an indispensable contribution". He summarised the book by saying "His focus on Israeli archival material should leave no trace of doubt that Israeli leaders knew that the war was not a defensive necessity, that it would be easily won, and that it was fought on the basis of cynical and strategic considerations of the state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://isreview.org/issue/59/unmasking-six-day-war "Unmasking the Six-Day War"] ''1967: Israel, the War and the Year that Transformed the Middle East'' by Tom Segev, Review by Hadas Thier, Issue #59: Reviews.&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[The Washington Post]] Book World'', [[Michael Oren]], an Israeli politician, historian  and author of ''[[Six Days of War]]'', gave Segev's ''1967'' a scathing review, writing, "Laboring to prove his point forces Segev not only to contradict himself but also to commit glaring oversights." He also says that "by disregarding the Arab dynamic and twisting his text to meet a revisionist agenda, he undermines his attempt to reach a deeper understanding of the war. Such an understanding is vital if Arabs and Israelis are to avoid similar clashes in the future and peacefully co-exist."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/07/AR2007060701872.html "Who Started It?"] ''1967 - Israel, the War, and the Year That Transformed the Middle East'' by Tom Segev, reviewed by Michael Oren. ''The Washington Post, June 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (In an interview in the online magazine ''Salon'', Oren subsequently said of Segev (who has a doctorate in history) "[He] is a journalist. He's not really a trained historian.")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2002/06/12/oren/ "Six days that shook the world"], ''Salon'', Suzy Hansen, 13 June, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benny Morris]] also criticized the book in a review in ''[[The New Republic]]''. Morris writes that he is open to [[historical revisionism]] but that Segev's central argument about Israel's internal condition leading up to the war "is essentially false." He adds: "For Segev, Arab politics and Arab society have no bearing upon the proper understanding of the origins of the war. ... [H]is book points readers and scholars in no worthwhile direction. Its argument is not merely wrong; it also makes a small contribution of its own to the contemporary delegitimation of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://spme.org/spme-research/letters-from-our-readers/book-reviews-benny-morris-reviews-tom-segev-and-foxbats-over-dimona-for-new-republic/3552/ Book Reviews: Benny Morris Reviews Tom Segev and Foxbats Over Dimona for New Republic]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Wentworth Wills''' (19 August 1835&amp;nbsp;– 2 May 1880) was a sportsman who is credited with being Australia's first [[cricket]]er of significance and a founder of [[Australian rules football|Australian football]]. Born in the British colony of [[New South Wales]] to a wealthy family descended from [[convicts in Australia|convict]]s, Wills grew up in [[Australian bush|the bush]] on properties owned by his father, the pastoralist and politician [[Horatio Wills]], in what is now the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. He befriended local [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]], learning their language and customs. At the age of 14, Wills went to England to attend [[Rugby School]], where he became [[captain (cricket)|captain]] of its cricket team, and played an early version of [[rugby football]]. After Rugby, Wills represented the [[Cambridge University Cricket Club]] in the [[The University Match (cricket)|annual match]] against [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford]], and played at [[first-class cricket|first-class]] level for [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]]. An athletic [[all-rounder]] with exceptional [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] skills, he was regarded as one of the finest young cricketers in England.

Returning to Victoria in 1856, Wills achieved Australia-wide stardom as a cricketer, captaining the [[Victoria cricket team|Victorian team]] to repeated victories in [[List of Australian intercolonial cricket matches|intercolonial matches]]. He played for, and was secretary of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]], but his [[larrikin]] streak and defections to rival clubs strained their relationship. In 1858 he called for the formation of a "foot-ball club" with a "code of laws" to keep cricketers fit during winter. After founding the [[Melbourne Football Club]] in 1859, Wills co-wrote the first [[laws of Australian football]]. He and his cousin [[H. C. A. Harrison]] spearheaded the sport's development as captains, umpires and administrators.

In 1861, at the height of his fame, Wills joined his father on an eight-month trek into the [[Queensland]] [[outback]] to establish a family property. Two weeks after their arrival, Wills' father and 18 others were murdered in the [[Cullin-la-ringo massacre|largest massacre]] of settlers by Aborigines in Australian history. Wills survived and resumed playing sport upon his return to Victoria in 1864, and in 1866–67, led an [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868#Background|Aboriginal cricket team]] on an Australian tour as its captain-coach. In a career marked by controversy, Wills challenged cricket's [[amateur status in first-class cricket|amateur]]-[[professional sports|professional]] divide, and was frequently accused of [[gamesmanship|bending sporting rules]], sometimes to the point of [[cheating]]. An admitted "[[throwing (cricket)|chucker]]", Wills was [[no-ball]]ed out of major cricket in 1872. He failed in an 1876 comeback attempt, by which time he was considered a relic of a bygone era.{{sfn|de Moore|2005|p=371}} His remaining years were characterised by social alienation, flights from creditors, and heavy drinking, likely as a means of coping with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) symptoms that plagued him after the massacre. In 1880, suffering from [[delirium tremens]], Wills committed suicide by stabbing himself in the heart.

Australia's first sporting celebrity, Wills fell into obscurity after his death, but has undergone a revival in [[culture of Australia|Australian culture]] since the 1990s. Today he is described as an archetypal tragic sports hero and as a symbol of [[reconciliation (ethnic relations)|reconciliation]] between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Controversy surrounds a theory that Wills incorporated features of an [[Marn Grook|Aboriginal game]] into early Australian football. According to biographer Greg de Moore, Wills "stands alone in all his absurdity, his cracked egalitarian heroism and his fatal self-destructiveness—the finest cricketer and footballer of the age".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=326}}

==Family and early years==
[[File:William Charles Wentworth, by Thomas Woolner (1825-1892).tif|thumb|upright|Wills' middle name comes from [[William Wentworth]], the statesman, explorer and "fighter for the rights of the Australian born". He served as Wills' childhood role model.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=8}}]]
Wills was born on 19 August 1835 on the [[Molonglo Plain]]{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} near modern-day [[Canberra]], in what was the British [[penal colony]] of [[New South Wales]], as the elder child{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} of [[Horatio Wills|Horatio]] and Elizabeth (née McGuire) Wills.{{sfn|Mandle|1976}} Tom was a third-generation Australian of [[Convicts in Australia|convict]] descent: his mother was born to convicts from Ireland, and his paternal grandfather was Edward Wills, an English [[highwayman]] whose death sentence for armed robbery was commuted to [[penal transportation#Australia|transportation]], arriving in [[Botany Bay]] aboard the "hell ship" {{ship||Hillsborough|1783 EIC ship|2}} in 1799.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2011|1p=3, 6|2a1=Howard|2a2=Larkins|2y=1981|2p=38}} Granted a conditional pardon in 1803, Edward became rich through mercantile activity in [[Sydney]] with his free wife Sarah (née Harding).{{sfn|Wills Cooke|2012|p=6}} He died in 1811, five months before Horatio's birth, and Sarah remarried to convict [[George Howe (printer)|George Howe]], owner of Australia's first newspaper, ''[[The Sydney Gazette]]''.{{sfn|Wills Cooke|2012|p=13}} Mainly self-educated, Horatio worked in the ''Gazette'' office from a young age, rising to become editor in 1832, the same year he met Elizabeth, an orphan from [[Parramatta]]. They married in December 1833.{{sfn|Wills Cooke|2012|pp=108–109}} Seventeen months after his birth, Tom was baptised Thomas Wentworth Wills in [[St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney|St Andrew's]], Sydney, after statesman [[William Wentworth]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=8}} Drawing on Wentworth's pro-[[Currency (lads and lasses)|currency]] writings and the [[emancipist]] cause, Horatio, in his [[Australian nationalism|nationalist]] journal ''The Currency Lad'' (1832–33), made the first call for an [[republicanism in Australia|Australian republic]].{{sfn|McKenna|1996|pp=23–25}}

[[File:Mount William as Seen from Mount Dryden.jpg|left|thumb|Wills grew up amongst Aboriginal clans in the Mount William area of the Grampians, shown in this 19th-century painting by [[Eugene von Guérard]].]]
Horatio turned to pastoralism in the mid-1830s and moved with his family to the sheep run Burra Burra on the [[Molonglo River]].{{sfnm|1a1=Judd|1y=2007|1p=114|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=8}} Although athletic from an early age, Tom was prone to illness, and at one stage in 1839 his parents "almost despaired of his recovery".{{sfnm|1a1=Wills Cooke|1y=2012|1p=173|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2pp=8–9}} The following year, in light of explorer [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]]'s discovery of "[[Australia Felix]]", the Willses, with shepherds and their families, were among the first settlers of the [[Grampian Mountains (Australia)|Grampians]] in the colony's [[Port Phillip District]] (now the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]). After [[squatting (pastoral)|squatting]] on [[Mount William (Mount Duwil)|Mount William]], they moved a few miles north through the foothills of [[Ararat, Victoria|Mount Ararat]], named so by Horatio because "like [[Noah's Ark|the Ark]], we rested there".{{sfnm|1a1=Molony|1y=2000|1pp=137–139|2a1=Wills Cooke|2y=2012|2p=37}} Horatio went through a period of intense religiosity while in the Grampians; at times his diary descends into incantation, "perhaps even madness" according to one scholar.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=190|2a1=Judd|2y=2007|2pp=115–116}} He implored himself and Tom to base their lives upon the [[New Testament]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=15}}

Living under canvas, the Wills family took up the leases of a large property named Lexington (near present-day [[Moyston, Victoria|Moyston]]) in an area used by [[Djab wurrung]] Aboriginal clans as a meeting place.{{sfnm|1a1=Wills Cooke|1y=2012|1p=37, 53|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=10}} According to family members, Tom, as an only child, "was thrown much into the companionship of aborigines".{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=165}} In an account of [[corroboree]]s from childhood, his cousin [[H. C. A. Harrison]]{{Ref_label|C|c|none}} remembered Tom's ability to learn Aboriginal songs, mimic their voice and gestures, and "speak their language as fluently as they did themselves, much to their delight."{{sfn|Hibbins|Mancini|1987|p=79}} It is speculated that Tom may have also [[Tom Wills#Marngrook theory|played Aboriginal sports]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=322–323}} Horatio wrote fondly of his son's kinship with Aborigines, and allowed local clans to live and hunt on Lexington.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2011|1pp=331–332|2a1=Wills Cooke|2y=2012|2pp=37–39}} However, [[George Augustus Robinson]], the district's [[Chief Protector of Aborigines]], implicated Horatio and other local settlers in the murder of Aborigines. Horatio blamed "distant predatory tribes" for provoking hostilities in the area, and the closest he came to admitting that he had killed Aborigines was in a letter to Governor [[Charles La Trobe]]: "... we shall be compelled in self defence to measures that may involve us in unpleasant consequences".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=11–14}}

Tom's first sibling, Emily, was born on Christmas Day 1842.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=14}} In 1846 Wills began attendance at William Brickwood's School in [[Melbourne]]. There he was looked after by Horatio's brother Thomas (Tom's namesake{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=8}}), a [[Victoria (Australia)#Creation of separate colony of Victoria|Victorian separatist]] and son-in-law of the Wills family's partner in the shipping trade, convict [[Mary Reibey]].{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2011|1pp=15–16|2a1=Judd|2y=2007|2p=111}} Tom played in his first [[cricket]] matches at school, and he came in contact with the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]] through Brickwood, the club's vice-president.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=16}} By 1849, the year Wills' schooling in Melbourne ended, his family had grown to include brothers Cedric, Horace and Egbert.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=18}} Horatio had ambitious plans for the education of his children, especially Tom:{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=15}}
{{quote|I now deeply vainly deplore my want of a mathematical and classical education. Vain regret!&amp;nbsp;... But my son! May he prove worthy of my experience! May I be spared for him—that he may be useful to his country—I never knew a father's care.}}

Wills' father sent him to England in February 1850, aged fourteen, to attend [[Rugby School]], the most prestigious school in the country.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=18–19}} He arrived in London after a five-month sea voyage. There, during school holidays, he stayed with his paternal aunt Sarah, who moved from Sydney after the death of her first husband, convict [[William Redfern]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=18–19}} In his scheme for his children, Horatio wanted Tom to go on to study law at the [[University of Cambridge]], and return to Australia as a "professional man of eminence".{{sfn |de Moore|2011|p=52}}

The reforms enacted by [[Thomas Arnold]], famed headmaster, made Rugby the crucible of [[muscular Christianity]], a "cult of athleticism" into which Wills was inculcated.{{sfn|Judd|2007|pp=133–135}} Wills took up cricket within a week of entering [[Rugby School#Houses|Evans House]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=23}} At first he bowled [[underarm bowling|underhand]], but it was considered outdated, so he tried [[roundarm bowling]]. He [[clean bowled]] a [[batting (cricket)|batsman]] with his first ball using this style and declared: "I felt I was a bowler."{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=24}} Wills soon topped all of his house's [[cricket statistics]].{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=43}} At bat he was a "punisher" with a sound defence; however, in an era when stylish stroke-play was expected of a gentleman cricketer, he was said to have no style at all.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=40, 44|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=49}} In April 1852, aged sixteen, Wills joined the Rugby School XI, and on his debut at [[Lord's]] a few months later, against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC), he took a match-high 12 [[Wickets#Dismissing a batsman|wickets]].{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=37}} That year his bowling was vital in establishing Rugby as the greatest public school in English cricket.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=37}} In a prelude to his colonial career, critics stated that Wills ought to be [[no-ball]]ed for [[throwing (cricket)|throwing]]—an illegal [[bowling action]]. Rugby coach [[John Lillywhite]], the umpire who [[Edgar Willsher#Overarm bowling|famously no-balled]] professional [[Edgar Willsher]], defended his protégé. Wills survived the scandal.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1pp=38–39, 78–79|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2pp=32–33}} He played with, and attracted praise from the leading cricketers of the age, including [[Alfred Mynn]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; [[William Clarke (cricketer)|William Clarke]], his hero, invited him to join the [[William Clarke's All-England Eleven|All-England Eleven]] in 1854, but he remained at school.

Rugby, like other English public schools, had evolved [[English public school football games#Rugby football|its own variant of football]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=43}} The game in Wills' era—a rough and highly defensive struggle involving hundreds of boys—was confined to a competition amongst the houses.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=45|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2pp=44–45}} Spanning his school years, Wills is one of the few players who is named in the newspapers' brief match reports.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=48}} His creative play and "eel-like agility" baffled the opposition, and his penchant for theatrics endeared him to the crowds.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=49}} One journalist noted his use of "slimy tricks", a possible early reference to his [[gamesmanship]].{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=49}} As a "dodger" in the forward line, he was a long and accurate shot at goal and served as his house's [[placekicker|kicker]].{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=50|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=46}} Wills also shone in the school's annual athletics carnival and his long-distance running ability in [[Paper Chase (game)|Hare and Hounds]] was unparalleled.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|pp=51–55}}

Wills cut a dashing figure with "impossibly wavy" hair and blue, almond-shaped eyes that "[burnt] with a pale light".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=50, 57}} By age 16 at 5'8" he was already taller than his father.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=28}} In ''[[The Guide to Cricketers|Lillywhite's Guide]]'' a few years later he measured in at 5'10" and it was written that "few athletes can boast of a more muscular and well-developed frame".&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{Cite wikisource| title = Mr Thomas W. Wills: A Biographical Sketch | last  = Hammersley | first = William| year  = 1869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumed by sport, Wills, to his father's chagrin, fell behind academically.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=40–42, 47–48}} It was said that he "could not bring himself to study for professional work" after "having led a sort of nomadic life when a youth in Australia".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=334}} Suffering from homesickness, he decorated his study with objects to remind him of Lexington, including [[Australian Aboriginal artifacts|Aboriginal weapons]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=25}} Horatio wrote to Tom about the latter's friends, the Djab wurrung: "They told me to send you up to them as soon as you came back."{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=33}}

In June 1855, nearing his 20th birthday, Wills finished his schooling. Hailed as Rugby's exemplar sportsman, his status as a cricketer had come to define him in the eyes of others.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=44}} In a farewell tribute from his fellow students he was called simply "the school bowler".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=50}}

After leaving Rugby, and with a steady supply of money from his father, Wills roamed Britain in pursuit of cricketing pleasure. Regarded as "one of the most promising cricketers in the kingdom",{{sfn|Inglis|1993|p=127}} he played with royalty, made [[first-class cricket|first-class]] appearances for the MCC, [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]], and various [[Gentlemen cricket team|Gentlemen sides]], and also fell in with the [[I Zingari]]—the "gypsy lords of English cricket"—an amateur club known for its exotic costumes and hedonistic lifestyle.{{sfnm|1a1=Flanagan|1y=2008|1p=546|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2pp=51–52, 57}} Against Horatio's wishes, Tom, having failed to [[matriculate]], did not continue his studies at Cambridge, but did play cricket for the [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|university's team]] (as well as [[Magdalene College]]), most notably in 1856 when rules barring non-student players from the [[The University Match (cricket)|University Match]] were ignored, Cambridge being "one man short" against [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=52–53, 334}} In June, Wills played cricket at Rugby School for the last time, representing the MCC alongside [[Heneage Finch, 6th Earl of Aylesford|Lord Guernsey]], the [[Edward Turnour, 5th Earl Winterton|Earl of Winterton]], and [[Charles du Cane]], governor-to-be of [[Tasmania]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=51}} Following a month of cricket in Ireland, Wills, at the behest of Horatio, returned to England to prepare for his journey home to Australia.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=53}}

The last eighteen months had exposed Wills to "the richest sporting experience on earth".{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=32}} His six years in England charted a way of life—one of drinking, reckless spending and playing games—that he would continue to lead until his death.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=32}}

Wills returned to Australia aboard the ''Oneida'' steamship, arriving in Melbourne on 23 December 1856. The minor port city of his youth had risen to world renown as the booming financial centre of the [[Victorian gold rush]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=54}} Horatio, now a member of the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] in the [[Parliament of Victoria|Victorian Parliament]], was living on "Belle Vue", a farm at [[Moolap, Victoria#Point Henry|Point Henry]] near [[Geelong]], the Wills' family home since 1853.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=55–57}} In his first summer back in Melbourne, Wills stayed with his extended family, the Harrisons, at their home on [[Victoria Parade, Melbourne|Victoria Parade]], and entered a [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]] law firm to appease his father, but he seems never to have practiced; the few comments he made about law suggest it meant little to him.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=64, 113}} "Tom was no dunce", writes Greg de Moore. He was "negotiating a path to greatness."{{sfn|de Moore|2012|p=16}}

The Australian colonies were described as "cricket mad" in the 1850s, and Victorians, in particular, were said to live "in an atmosphere of cricket".{{sfnm|1a1=Mandle|1y=1973|1p=225|2a1=Hibbins|2y=2013|2pp=110–111}} [[Intercolonial cricket in Australia|Intercolonial contests]], first held in 1851, provided an outlet for the at times intense rivalry between Victoria and New South Wales. With his reputation preceding him, Wills became the bearer of Victoria's hopes of winning its first match against the elder colony.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=57–58}} A former acquaintance in England, [[William Hammersley]], then captain of the [[Victoria cricket team|Victoria XI]], recalled Wills' first appearance on the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) for a trial match, staged one week after his return:&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;the observed of all observers, with his Zingari stripe and somewhat flashy get up, fresh from Rugby and college, with the polish of the old country upon him. He was then a model of muscular Christianity.}}

Wills won the match for his side with a top score of 57 [[not out]],{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=57–58}} and ''[[The Age]]'' said of his playing style and entertaining ability that "there has not been a more amusing scene on this ground".&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/154821778 "Eleven of Victoria v. A Selected Eleven"]. ''The Age'' (Melbourne). 6 January 1857. p. 3. Retrieved 6 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In the January 1857 intercolonial against New South Wales, held on [[the Domain, Sydney|the Domain]] in Sydney, Wills was the leading wicket-taker with ten victims, but failed with the bat. Bowling fast round-arm, the Victorians scoffed at the "antiquated" underhand action of their opponents. The latter style proved effective, however, giving New South Wales a 65-run win.{{sfnm|1a1=Clowes|1y=2007|1pp=6–7|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=60}} Back in Victoria, Wills joined numerous clubs, including the provincial Corio Cricket Club, based in Geelong, and the elite [[Melbourne Cricket Club]] (MCC).{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=62}} Although he had a greater affinity for Corio, the MCC maintained that Wills belonged to them, and took offence at his lack of loyalty to any one club.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=62, 95}} In order to secure Wills in matches between the two teams, the MCC allowed Corio to field an extra five men to make up for his loss.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=222–223}}

[[File:Intercolonial Cricket Match Victoria New South Wales 1858.jpg|thumb|left|Wills is shown preparing to bowl in an intercolonial match between Victoria and New South Wales, MCG, 1858. He captained Victoria to its first victory and was "an instant colonial hero".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=365}}]]
Parliament and business came to a standstill in Melbourne for the January 1858 intercolonial match between Victoria and New South Wales, held at the MCG. Captaining Victoria, Wills took 8 wickets, the most of his side, and on the second day, batting in the [[middle order]], a ball hit an imperfection in the pitch and knocked him unconscious. He recovered, played on for two hours, and won the match at day's end with a top score of 49*.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=78–80}} The crowd rushed the field and chaired Wills off in triumph, and victory celebrations lasted for several days throughout the colony.{{sfnm|1a1=Judd|1y=2007|1pp=141–142|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2pp=80–81}} Now a household name and the darling of Melbourne's elite, Wills was proclaimed "the greatest cricketer in the land".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=85–86}}

Although Wills enjoyed his lofty amateur status, he liked to socialise with and support working class professional cricketers—an [[egalitarian]] attitude that sometimes led to conflict with sporting officialdom but endeared him to the common man.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=72–76}} Wills' allegiance to professionals was highlighted by an incident in Tasmania in February 1858 when the [[Launceston Cricket Club]] shunned professional members of his touring Victorian side. Infuriated, he spoke out against being "forsaken" in a "strange land". One week later, during a game in [[Hobart]], Wills earned the locals' ire as he "[jumped] about exultantly" after maiming a Tasmanian batsman with a spell of hostile fast bowling.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=83–84}}

Wills was elected secretary of the MCC during the 1857–58 season.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=72}} It was a role in which he proved to be chaotic and disorganised. MCC delegates took issue with Wills' "continued non-attendance" at meetings, and when the club fell into debt, his poor administrative skills were blamed.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=86}} He acted on year-long threats in mid-1858 and deserted the MCC, leaving its records and amenities in dissaray; to this day, the only minutes that cannot be found date from his secretaryship.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=92}} A lasting tension existed between Wills and the MCC's inner circle. According to [[Martin Flanagan (journalist)|Martin Flanagan]], "It was a relationship which couldn't last as Wills only knew one way—his own."{{sfn|Judd|2007|p=152, 335}}

Wills was a compulsive writer to the press on cricketing matters and in the late 1850s his letters sometimes appeared on a daily basis.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=77–78}} An agitator like his father, he used language "in the manner of a speaker declaiming forcefully from a platform".{{sfnm|1a1=Blainey|1y=2003|1p=8|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=119}} On 10 July 1858, the Melbourne-based ''[[Bell's Life in Victoria and Sporting Chronicle]]'' published [[s:Winter Practice|a letter]] by Wills that is regarded as a catalyst for a new style of football, known today as [[Australian rules football]].{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=2–3}} Titled "Winter Practice", it begins:&lt;ref name="bells"&gt;''[[Bell's Life in Victoria]]'', 10 July 1858.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Now that cricket has been put aside for some few months to come, and cricketers have assumed somewhat of the chrysalis nature (for a time only 'tis true), but at length will again burst forth in all their varied hues, rather than allow this state of torpor to creep over them, and stifle their new supple limbs, why can they not, I say, form a foot-ball club, and form a committee of three or more to draw up a code of laws?}}

In endeavouring to keep cricketers active during the off-season, Wills made the first public declaration of its kind in Australia: that football should be a regular and organised activity.{{sfnm|1a1=Hess|1y=2008|1p=8|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=87}} Around this time he helped to foster football in Melbourne's schools.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=91}} The local headmasters, his collaborators, were inspired in large part by [[Thomas Hughes]]' novel ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' (1857), an account of life at Rugby School under the headship of Thomas Arnold.{{sfn|Blainey|2003|pp=28–30, 207}} Due to similarities between their sporting careers at Rugby, Wills has been called the "real-life embodiment" of [[Tom Brown (character)|Tom Brown]], the novel's fictitious hero.{{sfn|Judd|2007|p=135}}

Wills' letter was alluded to two weeks after its publication in an advertisement posted by his friend, professional cricketer and publican [[James Bryant (Australian cricketer)|Jerry Bryant]], for a "[[scratch match]]" held adjacent to the MCG at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]]. The first of several kickabouts held that year involving Wills, Bryant and other Melbourne cricketers,{{sfnm|1a1=Hess|1y=2008|1p=8, 10|2a1=Pennings|2y=2011|2p=14}} it was described by one participant as "football [[wikt:Babel|Babel]]"; a "short code of rules" were to be drawn up afterwards, however this does not seem to have occurred.{{sfnm|1a1=Blainey|1y=2003|1p=22|2a1=Coventry|2y=2015|2p=9}} Another landmark game, played without fixed rules over three Saturdays and co-umpired by Wills and teacher [[John Macadam]], began on the same site on 7 August between forty [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]] students and a like number from [[Melbourne Grammar]].{{sfn|Blainey|2003|pp=15–18}} The two schools have since [[Cordner–Eggleston Cup|competed annually]].{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|2009|p=9}} Wills emerged as the standout figure in accounts of Melbourne football in 1858.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=91}} These early experimental games were more rugby-like than anything else—low-scoring, low-to-the-ground "gladiatorial" tussles.{{sfnm|1a1=Hibbins|1a2=Ruddell|1y=2009|1p=13|2a1=Pennings|2y=2013|2p=1}} The last recorded match of the year is the subject of the first known Australian football poem, published in ''[[Melbourne Punch|Punch]]''. Wills, the only player named, is reified as "the Melbourne chief", leading his men to victory against a side from [[South Yarra]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hess|1y=2008|1p=16|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2pp=91–92}}

Following a scratch match at the start of the 1859 football season, the [[Melbourne Football Club]] officially came into being on 14 May.{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|p=5}} Three days later, Wills and three other members—Hammersley, journalist [[J. B. Thompson]] and teacher [[Thomas H. Smith]]—met near the MCG at the Parade Hotel, owned by Bryant, to devise and codify the club's rules.{{sfn|Hess|2008|p=i}} The men went over the rules of four English schools; Hammersley recalled Wills' preference for the Rugby game, but it was found to be confusing and too violent.{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|p=7}} Subsequently, they rejected common features such as "hacking" (shin-kicking) and produced a signed document listing [[Laws of Australian rules football#Melbourne Rules of 1859|ten simple rules]] suited to grown men and Australian conditions.{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|pp=14–15}} Heading the list of signatories, Wills, too, saw the need for compromise.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=101, 325}} He wrote to his brother Horace: "Rugby was not a game for us, we wanted a winter pastime but men could be harmed if thrown on the ground so we thought differently."{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=101}} Thompson and Hammersley's promotion of the new code, together with Wills' star power, encouraged the spread of football throughout Victoria.

==Height of celebrity==
[[File:Tom Wills Victorian cricketers 1859.jpg|thumb|Wills (far right) with professional members of the Victoria XI, 1859. He preferred the company of professionals in an era when they were shunned by amateurs of his social stature.]]
After his fallout with the MCC, Wills moved freely about Victoria, playing for any club of his choosing. He became president of [[Collingwood Cricket Club|Collingwood]] and vice-president of [[Monash Tigers|Richmond]], raising the standard of the latter's play to make it the premier club in the colony.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=95–96}} There were calls to bar Wills from some club matches, for when a side secured him, often as a late inclusion, he was seen to distort the balance of play and dramatically alter the odds, forcing bookmakers to declare "[[wikt:all bets are off|all bets are off]]". But all clubs still coveted Wills when it suited their cause, and there was scarcely a day when he was not playing or practising cricket.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=62, 77}}

Wills was reappointed captain of Victoria for the January 1859 intercolonial against New South Wales, held at the Domain. He broke his right middle finger on day one while attempting a catch. Undeterred, Wills top scored in the first innings with 15* and took 5/24 and 6/25, carrying Victoria to an upset win.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=96–97}} He resigned from the intercolonial match committee in protest of Thompson assailing him for not practicing ahead of the next match against New South Wales. During a follow-up practice match, players struggled in the day's heat, and ignoring calls to retire, Wills suffered a near-fatal [[sunstroke]]. Hammersley wrote that Wills felt obliged to perform for the large crowd that had gathered to watch him.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=106–107}} Over 25,000 people attended the MCG in February 1860 to see Victoria, captained by Wills, play New South Wales. Wills bowled unchanged in both innings, taking 6/23 and 3/16, and top scored with 20*. Victoria won by 69 runs.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=107}} The Melbourne media gave Wills the sobriquet "Great Gun of the Colony".{{sfn|Judd|2007|p=142}} A British correspondent called him "a cricketer born".&lt;ref&gt;"Cricket in the South".

Wills remained an influential figure in Australian football from 1859 to 1860.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=104}} While he fought for the adoption of several Rugby School customs—such as a [[free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]] for [[mark (Australian rules football)|marking]], the use of an [[Rugby union ball|oval-shaped ball]], and (unsuccessfully) a crossbar—he pushed the game in new directions as a captain and tactician, such as during an 1860 match when he used positional play to exploit the code's lack of an [[offside (sport)|offside law]], at which point, according to [[James Coventry]], "the full potential of the sport started to be realised".{{sfn|Coventry|2015|p=10}}

At Wills' invitation, his cousin H. C. A. Harrison took up football in 1859, and quickly became a leading player and captain.{{sfn|Coventry|2015|p=27, 30}} He looked up to Wills, terming him "the beau-ideal of an athlete"—high praise given that Harrison was the champion runner of Victoria.{{sfnm|1a1=Blainey|1y=2003|1pp=68–69|2a1=De Moore|2y=2011|2p=105}} Their presence in Geelong fuelled a local craze for football and ensured the [[Geelong Football Club]]'s supremacy in the early 1860s.{{sfn|Pennings|2012|p=29–31}} In an era when players moved freely among clubs, Wills still represented Melbourne, and in 1860, was the first captain and secretary of the Richmond Football Club (no connection with [[Richmond Football Club|the AFL club]]).{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|2009|p=8, 12}} The code underwent revisions around this time, principally in response to the on-field actions of dominant players.

[[File:Horatio Wills portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Horatio Wills]]
With plans underway for the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1861–62|first tour of Australia]] by an [[England national cricket team|English cricket team]], Wills announced his retirement from sport. At his father's beckoning, Wills agreed to leave Victoria to help found a new family property, Cullin-la-ringo, on the [[Nogoa River]] in [[outback]] [[Queensland]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=111–112}} He prepared for six months in country Victoria where learnt the crafts of a [[squatter (pastoral)|squatter]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=115}} In his will, Horatio—showing a "deep understanding" of Tom's personality—wrote that his son would be removed from the station and receive a diminished inheritance in the event of "misconducting himself" as manager.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=114–115}}

In January 1861, Tom, Horatio and a party of employees and their families travelled by steamer to [[Brisbane]], disembarked in [[Moreton Bay]], and then, with livestock and supplies, set out on an eight-month trek through Queensland's rugged interior.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=115}} Food was scarce and Tom hunted native game to fend off starvation.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=116}} They suffered many other hardships and even death when, in [[Toowoomba]], one of Horatio's men drowned.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=116}} On the [[Darling Downs]] over 10,000 sheep were collected.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=117}} The size of the Wills party attracted the attention of local Aborigines, and the two groups engaged in games of mimicry.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=121}} Wary of entering [[Australian frontier wars#Queensland|the region's frontier war]], Horatio sought peaceful coexistence with the Aborigines.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=118}} The party reached Cullin-la-ringo, situated on Kairi Aboriginal land, in early October, and proceeded to set up camp.{{sfn|Reid|1981|pp=70–71}}

===Cullin-la-ringo massacre===
{{main|Cullin-la-ringo massacre}}
[[File:Wills Tragedy 1861.jpg|thumb|left|''The Wills Tragedy, 1861'' depicts the aftermath of the deadliest attack on settlers by Aborigines in the [[Australian frontier wars]].]]
On the afternoon of 17 October, two weeks after their arrival, Horatio and eighteen of his party were murdered in the [[Cullin-la-ringo massacre|deadliest massacre]] of settlers by Aborigines in Australian history.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=3|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2pp=120–122}} Tom was away from the property at the time, having been sent with two [[stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] to collect supplies left en route to Cullin-la-Ringo. He returned several days later to a scene of devastation.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=121}} Despairing and in shock, Wills first wrote to Harrison in Melbourne: "... all our party except I have been slaughtered by the black's ... I am in a great fix no men."{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=122}} Police, [[native police]] and vigilante groups from neighbouring stations swiftly tracked down and killed at least 30 local Aborigines; the total may have been 70.{{sfnm|1a1=Reid|1y=1981|1pp=74–75|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=130}} Wills took refuge near Cullin-la-ringo, and though he desired to avenge his father's death, there is no evidence that he joined the reprisal raids.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=125, 130}}

Conflicting reports reached the outside world and for a time it was feared that Tom had died.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=126}} In the press, Horatio was accused of ignoring warnings and allowing Aborigines to encroach on his property.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=131}} The retribution was also called excessive.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=130, 341}} Tom vehemently defended his father against any perceived criticism.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=131}} Privately, in his letter to Harrison, he admitted, "if we had used common precaution all would have been well".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=134}} It was later revealed that, prior to leaving the camp, Tom advised Horatio to be watchful of the local Aborigines, but according to Hammersley, "the old man prided himself on being able to manage the blacks ... and said they would never harm him."{{sfn|de Moore|2008|pp=129–130, 133}} The Queensland press, still in the wake of the massacre, suggested that Wills, "now a Queenslander", be approached to captain [[Queensland cricket team|the colony's cricket team]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=128}}

Different reasons were put forward at the time to account for the Wills tragedy.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=125}} For many colonists, it confirmed the popular belief that Aborigines were bloodthirsty [[wikt:savage|savage]]s.{{sfn|Reid|1981|p=79}} Tom never articulated his version of events in writing, but his brother Cedric wrote years later that it was an act of revenge for an attack made on local Aborigines by squatter Jesse Gregson. He quoted Tom as saying, "If the truth is ever known, you will find that it was through Gregson shooting those blacks; that was the cause of the murder."{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=134}}

In the years following the massacre, Wills experienced [[flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s, nightmares and an [[Da Costa's syndrome|irritable heart]]—features of what is now known as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). Having immersed himself in the [[drinking culture]] of colonial sport, he increased his alcohol consumption in a likely attempt to blot out memories and alleviate sleep disturbance.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2011|1pp=136–137|2a1=de Moore|2y=2008|2pp=214–217}} Wills' sister Emily wrote of him two months after the massacre: "He says he never felt so changed in the whole course of his life".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=136}}

===Riot and expulsion===
[[File:Tom Wills carte de visite.jpg|thumb|left|Tom Wills, c. 1863]]
Wills made a vow over Horatio's grave to remain on Cullin-la-ringo and make it "the pride of Queensland"—words that, according to de Moore, "enshrined and imprisoned" Tom as the new head of the family.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=193|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2pp=134–135}} Hypervigilant, he slept only three hours a night with a rifle beside his bed and watched for signs of another attack.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2011|1p=137|2a1=de Moore|2y=2012|2p=17}} He began to rebuild the station pending the arrival of his uncle-in-law, William Roope, who took control of Cullin-la-ringo in December 1861, but soon left due to Wills acting "exceedingly ill" to him.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=141–142}} Wills struggled to cope with the harsh conditions and isolation of the outback. He went blind for weeks after contracting "[[sandy blight]]".

He went to Sydney in January 1863 to captain Victoria against New South Wales on the Domain. The match turned into a riot when the crowd [[pitch invasion|invaded the field]] during a dispute over the Victorian umpire's impartiality. Wills, leading his men from the Domain, was struck in the face by a stone, and professionals [[George Marshall (Victoria cricketer)|George Marshall]] and [[William Greaves (cricketer)|William Greaves]] fled the city, reducing the Victorian side to nine men. Wills took 8 wickets and top scored in both innings (25* and 17*), but Victoria lost by 84 runs. The Melbourne media castigated Wills for allowing the game to continue and called him a traitor when evidence surfaced that he agreed to play for New South Wales in the weeks prior to the match. He denied all accusations and wrote in an angry letter to ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'': "I for one do not think that Victoria will ever send an Eleven up here again."{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=149–151}} Back in Victoria, he became engaged to Julie Anderson, a farmer's daughter from [[Skipton, Victoria|Skipton]] and friend of the Wills family. Her name does not appear in any of Wills' surviving letters; he rarely mentioned the women he courted, let alone his feelings for them.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=153–155, 171}} Wills stayed in Geelong for the start of the 1863 football season, breaking his promise of an early return to Cullin-la-ringo, much to the dismay of his mother and the holding's trustees.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=155}}

Wills finally returned to Queensland in May and was sworn in as a [[Justice of the Peace#Queensland|Justice of the Peace]] upon arrival in Brisbane.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=156}} Over the next few months at Cullin-la-ringo, he reported at least three murders of local settlers by Aborigines, among them one of his shepherds.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|pp=134–135}} He accosted government officials, seeking the detachment of a Native Police Force to his station for protection, and scorned "Brisbane saints" for sympathising with the plight of Aborigines in the Nogoa region.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1pp=131–132|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2pp=157–158}} With the cricket season approaching, Wills agreed to captain Queensland against New South Wales, and then left the colony to lead a Victoria XXII at the MCG against [[George Parr (cricketer)|George Parr]]'s [[English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1863–64|All-England Eleven]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=159}} In awe of his 1,800 mile dash across the continent to play cricket, the English thought it a madman's journey.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=160}} Wills arrived on the final day of the match to a rapturous reception, and went in as a substitute fielder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/72512672 "Grand International Cricket Match"].

The 1863–64 season saw Wills' engagement to Anderson collapse, possibly due to his womanising, and the trustees of Cullin-la-ringo accused him of mismanaging the property, in part by squandering family finances on alcohol while claiming it as station expenditure.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=197, 222|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2pp=162–163}} They demanded that he stay in Victoria to answer for the property's runaway debt. In response, Wills left Australia to join Parr's XI on a month-long tour of New Zealand.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=164}} Initially standing in as umpire, he went on to captain local teams against the English, and filled the same role for a Victoria XXII at the end of the tour in Melbourne.{{sfn|de Moore|p=165, 168}} He faced the trustees soon after. With his mother's reluctant approval, they decided to dismiss him from Cullin-la-ringo, thus fulfilling the premonition in Horatio's will.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=166–168}}

==Return to Victoria==
[[File:Geelong Melbourne 1880.jpg|thumb|Football match between Geelong and Melbourne. The two clubs fought over which side "owned" Wills.]]
Wills stayed at the family home in Geelong. Always a [[black sheep]] of sorts, he now became increasingly estranged from his mother and sister Emily.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=201|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2pp=169–170}} Family letters from mid-1864 reveal that Wills had a "wife"—a "bad woman" according to Emily. It is likely a reference to the already-married Sarah Barbor (née Duff). Born in [[Dublin]], she is a mysterious figure, but is known to have remained Wills' lifelong partner. The [[De facto relationship|de facto]] nature of their relationship, and even Barbor's existence, were probably kept secret from Wills' mother for a number of years.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=171–172, 345–346}}

Throughout the 1865 football season, Wills played for and often captained Melbourne and Geelong, two of the game's most powerful clubs. At the end of a winter beset with public brawls over which team "owned" him, Wills moved to Geelong for the remainder of his career, prompting ''Bell's Life in Victoria'' to report that Melbourne had lost "the finest leader of men on the football field".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=173, 176–177}} The following year, when the [[running bounce]] and [[Laws of australian football#Victorian Rules of 1866|other rules were formalised]] at a meeting of club delegates under Harrison's chairmanship, Wills was not present; his move to Geelong had cut him off from the rule-making process in Melbourne.{{sfnm|1a1=Hibbins|1a2=Ruddell|1y=2009|1p=22|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=181}}

Intercolonials between Victoria and New South Wales resumed at the MCG on Boxing Day 1865, nearly three years since the Sydney riot. [[Sam Cosstick]], [[William Caffyn]] and other Victorian professionals defected to the rival colony due to pay disputes with the MCC. Wills, leading the weakened Victorian side to an against-the-odds win, took 6 wickets and contributed 58—the first [[half century]] in Australian first-class cricket—to 285, a record intercolonial total.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=178–180}} Allegations that Wills cheated his way to victory failed to endanger his status as a folk hero and "a source of eternal hope" for Victoria.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=85, 89|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2pp=179–180}}

==Aboriginal cricket team==

[[File:Aboriginal cricket team Tom Wills 1866.jpg|thumb|Wills (back row, center) with the Aboriginal XI outside the MCC pavilion of the MCG, December 1866]]
In May 1866, the MCC's minute book featured an unusual request: Roland Newbury, the club's pavilion keeper, wanted "use of the ground for two days&amp;nbsp;... for purpose of a match with the native black eleven".{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=136}} It was the first intimation of a cricket match between the MCC and an Aboriginal team from Victoria's [[Western District (Victoria)|Western District]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=181}} The motive behind the match, scheduled for late December, was a financial one, and in August, Wills agreed to coach the Aborigines. Wills' reasons for accepting the role remain a mystery, but his need for money was likely a factor.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=137}} This was to mark the beginning of his transition from amateur to professional sportsman.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=182–183}}

Wills travelled inland in November to convene the players from [[Edenhope, Victoria|Edenhope]] and [[Harrow, Victoria|Harrow]], where they worked as [[station hand]]s.{{sfn|Mallett|2002|pp=18–20}} One of their employers, William Hayman, acted as the team's manager and "protector".{{sfn|Mallett|2002|pp=23–24}} They were mostly [[Jardwadjali]] men who shared common vocabulary with the neighbouring Djab wurrung people, which enabled Wills to use the Aboriginal language he learnt as a child.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=184}} From their training ground at [[Lake Wallace]], Wills, in a "tactical strike", boasted to the Melbourne press of the Aborigines' powers, especially the batsmanship of Unamurriman, commonly known as [[Johnny Mullagh|Mullagh]].{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} In a response that drew widespread criticism, the MCC strengthened its ranks with non-members.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2011|1p=184|2a1=de Moore|2y=2008|2p=140}} Public sympathy was with the Aborigines when they arrived in Melbourne and over 10,000 spectators attended the MCG on Boxing Day to see them play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article199053811 "M.C.C. vs. Ten Aboriginals with T.

Retrieved 25 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Captained by Wills, they lost the match, but won praise for their performance. Wills afterwards accused the MCC of "treachery".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=188–189}}

It is unknown what Wills and the Aborigines made of the broader social and political dimensions of the enterprise.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=209}} Some of Wills' contemporaries were shocked that he would associate with Aborigines in the shadow of his father's death.{{sfn|de Moore|2012|p=17}} Others, such as this writer in ''[[Empire (newspaper)|The Empire]]'', addressed him as a hero:{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=198–199}}
{{quote|Although you may not be fully aware of the fact, allow me to tell you that you have rendered a greater service to the aboriginal races of this country and to humanity, than any man who has hitherto attempted to uphold the title of the blacks to rank amongst men.}}

[[File:Albert Ground Sydney.jpg|thumb|left|Wills' stint in jail following his arrest on the [[Albert Ground, Sydney|Albert Ground]] (pictured) marked the decline of his role within the team.]]
While Melburnians were enthralled by the Aborigines, the annual intercolonial between Victoria and New South Wales—usually the season highlight—failed to excite public interest, and Victoria's loss in Sydney was put down to Wills' absence.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=190}} The Aboriginal team improved as it toured Victoria in January. After an easy win in Geelong, Wills took the players to "Belle Vue" to meet his mother.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=191}} Back in Melbourne, two of the Aborigines, [[Bullocky (cricketer)|Bullocky]] (Bullenchanach) and Cuzens (Yellana), joined Wills in representing Victoria against a Tasmanian XVI.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=199–200}} The team's successes provoked a public discourse over past mistreatment of Aborigines and future [[sociology of race and ethnic relations|relations between the races]].{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2011|1pp=197–198|2a1=de Moore|2y=2008|2pp=146–147}} Wills' role took on a symbolic significance: his status as a 'native' (native-born Australian) was used to identify him with his '[[wikt:native#Noun|native]]' (indigenous) teammates, and he was also noted for speaking in "their own lingo".{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=152|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=185}} Jellico (Murrumgunarriman), the "team jester", joked: "[Wills] too much along of us. He speak nothing now but [[wikt:blackfellow|blackfellow]] talk."{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=196–197}}

They went to Sydney in February to begin a tour of the colonies and overseas.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=192, 200–201}} Aware of the tour's lucrative potential, Englishman [[Charles Lawrence (cricketer)|Charles Lawrence]], captain of New South Wales, invited the team to stay at his hotel on [[Manly Beach]].{{sfn|Mallett|2002|pp=26–27}} Their first match against his club at the [[Albert Ground, Sydney|Albert Ground]] in [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]] came to a dramatic halt when Wills was arrested and briefly gaoled for a breach of contract.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|pp=154–159}} He and W. E. B. Gurnett, the tour promoter, had been vying to take over as manager.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=348}} The team was left stranded after Gurnett embezzled some of the funds, confirming Wills' suspicion that he was a con artist.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=205}} With plans of a trip abroad abandoned, Lawrence set up a "benefit" match, and by the end of the tour's New South Wales leg, had usurped Wills as captain.{{sfnm|1a1=Mallett|1y=2002|1p=28|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=206}} No longer attracting significant crowds or media attention, they returned to Victoria in May, and within two weeks, Wills was in Geelong playing football.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=207}} It has been said that, due to his drinking habit, he exercised a "bad influence" upon the Aborigines, four of whom died from illness during or soon after the tour; the inquest into one death, that of Watty (Bilvayarrimin), and a follow-up police report revealed cases of alcohol abuse among the players.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1pp=240–241|2a1=Mallett|2y=2002|2pp=28–29}}

The surviving members formed part of the Aboriginal team which Lawrence [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868|took to England in 1868]], ten years before the first [[Australia national cricket team|Australian XI]] classed as representative [[Australian cricket team in England and the United States in 1878|went overseas]].{{sfn|Mallett|2002|p=25, 29}} Wills resented Lawrence for reviving the team without him; his exclusion has been called the tragedy of his sporting career.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2011|1p=214|2a1=Flanagan|2y=2008|2p=548}}

==Ambiguous professional==
[[File:William Handcock Tom Wills.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tom Wills portrait|Portrait of Wills]] in the colours of the MCC, William Handcock, 1870, [[National Sports Museum]] collection]]
Without career prospects outside of sport, Wills joined the MCC as a professional at the start of the 1867–68 season; however, he was not openly referred to as such. Instead, the club devised the title of '[[tutor]]' in order that he maintain the prestige of his amateur background.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=210–212}}

Played on the MCG, the December 1867 intercolonial between Victoria and New South Wales ended in a sound victory for the former, principally due to Wills' nine-wicket haul and [[Richard Wardill]]'s [[century (cricket)|century]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=214}} Wills had been Victoria's preferred captain for over a decade. Writing in his sports column, Hammersley claimed that, as a paid cricketer, Wills lacked "moral ascendancy" over amateurs.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=218–219}} When he lost the captaincy to Wardill, an amateur, on the eve of the March 1869 match against New South Wales, he refused to play under him, or, indeed, anyone else. The Victorians condemned Wills and resolved to go on without him, after which he retracted his decision not to play. This was the last intercolonial played on the Domain and Victoria recovered from Wardill's [[diamond duck]] to win by 78 runs. Wills scalped 7 wickets in a single innings.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=218–219}}

After the intercolonial, Wills announced that he would not play for Victoria again, even if the colony wanted him.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=222}} He planned to return to Cullin-la-ringo in early 1869, but his mother, still "very dissatisfied" with him, requested that he stay away from the station.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=232}} The MCC took him back and he continued to act as a tutor with the club.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=222–223}} Wills' former Aboriginal teammates, Mullagh and Cuzens, joined him at the MCC as paid bowlers.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=142}}

Wills' physical appearance had deteriorated; gaining weight, balding and generally unkempt, with "an alcoholic blush of his cheeks", he looked older than his years.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2011|1p=187, 226|2a1=de Moore|2y=2008|2p=218}} Describing his body as "stiff" during a cricket match in 1870, he hinted, for the first time, that his talent was fading.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=232}}

==No-ball plot and downfall==
{{Quote|text=For Mr. Wills to no-ball Mr. Wardill for throwing is like Satan reproving sin.|sign=Hammersley{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=230}}}}
[[File:Tom Wills William Hammersley.jpg|thumb|left|upright|As ''[[The Australasian]]'''s chief sportswriter, Hammersley (standing) led a campaign to have Wills (seated) banned from intercolonial cricket.]]
Hardly a year had passed since Wills' return to Australia in 1856 without public comment on his suspect [[bowling action]].{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=76}} As the most famous and outspoken colonial bowler to be accused of throwing, Wills became a "convenient caricature" of the cheat in cricket.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=113–114}} He was cast as a villain for inciting a "plague" of throwing, especially among younger bowlers.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|pp=80–81}} For years his amateur status and "transcendent skill" had protected him, as had the collusion of Victorian newspapers, clubs and spectators, but now an ageing professional, the campaign against his throwing gathered strength.

In February 1870, Wills captained Victoria to a 265-run win over New South Wales at the MCG. The match featured [[Twopenny (cricketer)|Twopenny]] (Jarrawuk), an Aboriginal [[fast bowling|paceman]] who was said to have been recruited by Lawrence as a foil to Wills' "chucks".{{sfn|Mallett|2002|p=79}} Comparing the two, the Melbourne press surmised: "Undoubtedly Wills throws sometimes, but there is some decency about it, some disguise."{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=224}} In March, Victoria trounced a Tasmanian XVI in Launceston under Wills' leadership, though not without criticism of his bowling action.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=225}} The accusations of throwing were growing louder, and one-time ally Hammersley, now Melbourne's foremost sportswriter, emerged as Wills' most vocal critic.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=77|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=231}} He accused Wills of resorting to throwing to maintain pace as he aged, and criticised him for introducing a type of [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] designed to injure and intimidate batsmen.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=84}} ''[[The Australasian]]'', Hammersley's newspaper, described Wills' [[modus operandi]]: "If I cannot hit your wicket or make you give a chance soon, I'll hit you and hurt you if I can. I'll frighten you out."{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=84}}

In the face of a looming crisis in his career, Wills admitted to throwing in his 1870–71 ''Australian Cricketers' Guide'', and in so doing taunted his enemies to stop him.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=85}} Nonetheless, he was made Victoria XI captain for the March 1871 intercolonial against New South Wales, held at the Albert Ground. Wills' first innings top score of 39* was offset by his drunken behaviour in the field and his apparent reluctance to bowl for fear of being called. Victoria won by 48 runs.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=231–232}} Not long after, Wills was no-balled for throwing for the first time in a club match. Rumour spread that the umpire had conspired against him with the opposing club's owner.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=84|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2pp=233–234}}

A series of superb club cricket performances removed any doubt that Wills would play for Victoria in the next intercolonial against New South Wales, scheduled for March 1872 on the MCG.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=241}} Before the game, representatives from both colonies met and entered into a bilateral agreement designed to call Wills.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|pp=86–88}} When he opened the bowling, Wills became the first cricketer to be [[List of cricketers called for throwing in top-class cricket matches in Australia|called for throwing in a top-class Australian match]]. He was called two more times in two overs, and did not bowl again.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=241–242}} He was again no-balled when a Victorian side under his captaincy lost to a combined XIII from New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia late in 1872.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=244}}

Hammersley had seemingly triumphed in his campaign to have Wills banned from intercolonial cricket.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=247}} In an exchange of personal attacks in the press, Wills implied that Hammersley was an architect of the no-ball plot, and protested that he and other English colonists were out to oppress native-born Australians.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=87|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=242}} Wills went on to threaten him with legal action. Hammersley closed:{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=247}}
{{quote|You are played out now, the cricketing machine is rusty and useless, all respect for it is gone. You will never be captain of a Victorian Eleven again, ... Eschew colonial beer, and take [[teetotalism|the pledge]], and in time your failings may be forgotten, and only your talents as a cricketer remembered. Farewell, Tommy Wills.}}

==Grace and comeback attempt==
[[File:WG Grace 1873.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1873 caricature of [[W. G. Grace]]. In his obituaries, Wills was referred to as "the Grace of Australia".{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=7}}]]
[[W. G. Grace]], the Victorian era's most famous cricketer, brought an English team to Australia [[W. G. Grace with the English cricket team in Australia in 1873–74|in 1873–74]]. Wills was desperate to play for Victoria against Grace and rival cricketing factions fought over his possible inclusion. Hammersley, a selector, ensured his omission.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=251}} Wills toured with the team, playing for country sides.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=253}} Irked by Wills' constant presence, Grace remarked that he seemed to regard himself as a representative of the whole of Australia.{{sfn|Wills Cooke|2012|p=194}} It was assumed that, on his homeward journey, Grace would play a final match in the South Australian capital of [[Adelaide]], but he bypassed the city when [[Kadina, South Australia|Kadina]], a remote mining town in the [[Copper Coast|Copper Triangle]], offered him more money. Wills coached the locals.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=254–255}} Played in an open, rock-strewn plain of baked earth, the game was deemed a farce. Wills made a [[duck (cricket)#Pair|pair]] and Grace later wrote derisively of the "old Rugbeian" as a has-been.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=262–263}} Grace neglected to mention that Wills bowled him, ending with 6/28.{{sfn|Molony|2000|p=143}}

In Geelong, Wills was still idolised, though he seemed discontented, seeking any chance to earn money through cricket in the major cities.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=272–273}} He maintained an interest in the development of football, what he called "the king of games".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=271}} He continued to suggest rule changes, such as the [[push in the back]] rule to curb injuries, and, as captain of Geelong, had shaped the sport's playing style.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=268}} Utilising the young squad's speed and skill, Wills devised an innovative game plan—what he called "scientific football"—based on passing and running into open space.{{sfn|Coventry|2015|p=31–33}} He pioneered another tactical manoeuvre in [[Ballarat]] by controversially ordering his players to [[flooding (Australian football)|flood]] the backline to prevent [[Ballarat Football Club|the home side]] from scoring. He and his men incited the crowd further by wasting time and deliberately kicking the ball out of bounds.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=268–269}} A few years later, in a rare act of diplomacy, Wills quelled tensions after a rival club used his "unchivalrous tactics" against Geelong.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=353}} He played his last football game in 1874.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=270}}

The Victoria XI suffered a streak of losses against New South Wales after Wills' downfall.{{sfn|Clowes|2009|p=19}} In his 1874–75 ''Australian Cricketers' Guide'', Wills argued that a new captain was needed to restore Victoria's glory. "No one reading his words could mistake its intent—what Victoria needed was Tom Wills", writes de Moore.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=274}} For the first time in years, the Victorian selection committee shortlisted Wills for the next intercolonial against New South Wales. Noting his faded skills and past transgressions, the Melbourne press lamented, "there is some sentimental notion afloat that as a captain he is peerless."{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=276}} Pessimism gave way to hope as Wills promised a win, and in February 1876 he led the Victoria XI onto the Albert Ground. Batting last in the order, he went for 0 and 4 and failed to take a wicket despite bowling the most overs of his side. The media blamed him for Victoria's 195-run loss.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=277}} In turn, he blamed his teammates.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=278}}

==Final years==
By 1877, Wills' cricket career "had become a series of petty disputes in petty games" of "ever-deteriorating standards."{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=280–282}} No longer an office-bearer with Corio, he moved amongst lower-level clubs in the Geelong area, earning scraps of money wherever he could.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=280–282}} In a brief postscript to one of several rejected applications for employment at the MCC, Wills gave voice to old cricketers "left in the cold". De Moore interpreted the postscript as "an unmistakable backhander for the club." He continues: "To see Wills simply as a beggar would be to misunderstand him."{{sfn|de Moore|2008|pp=281–282}}

Following his retirement as a footballer, Wills turned to umpiring and committee work, and despite his continued slide into debt, donated money and trophies for football competitions.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=270-271}} He served as Geelong's vice-president from 1873 to 1876, and was one of three delegates appointed by the club after the 1877 formation of the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA), but was dropped soon after for unknown reasons.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=282, 353}} During the [[1878 VFA season]], he acted as central umpire, and defended his adjudication of a June match between [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] and [[Albert Park Football Club (VFA)|Albert Park]] in what would be his last public letter.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=289–290}} That year, Wills, broke and hounded by creditors, began selling land in Geelong to help clear his debt, and moved with Barbor to [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=286, 292}}

Wills held no positions of power at the [[South Melbourne Cricket Club]] and only occasionally appeared in local team lists.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=290}} He nonetheless convinced the club to open [[South Melbourne Cricket Ground|its ground]] to football in winter by arguing that it would make the turf firm and durable.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=288–289}} Other clubs soon followed South Melbourne's example and football adapted to an [[Australian rules football playing field|oval-shaped field]].{{sfn|Hess|2008|p=44}} By now, the sport had spread throughout Australasia with Melbourne matches attracting the world's largest football crowds yet seen.{{sfn|Blainey|2003|p=108}}

In late 1878, the MCC rejected Wills' last overture to the club, and his dwindling income from cricket was "finally asphyxiated".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=291}} From February 1879 onwards, he lived with Barbor in [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]], a small village on the margins of Melbourne. Wills made only two trips outside of Heidelberg for the remainder of his life; on one of these, in January 1880, he was sighted at the MCG during an intercolonial between Victoria and New South Wales.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=294–296}} His alcoholism worsened over this period, as did Barbor's, also a heavy drinker.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=301}} Occasionally he coached the Heidelberg Cricket Club, and, on 13 March 1880, played for the side against a "travelling circus" of [[bohemianism|bohemians]] in his last recorded game. Wills took five wickets, his "chucks" working "sweetly" on the rough pitch.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=281, 297}} In his last surviving letters, sent two days later to his brothers on Cullin-la-ringo, he wrote that he was "out of the world" in Heidelberg, and fantasised about escaping to Tasmania. Begging for money to help pay off debts, he promised, "I will not trouble any of you again".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=299–301}}

===Suicide===
[[File:Melbourne Hospital 1868.jpg|thumb|Wills fled the Melbourne Hospital within hours of his admission.]]
Isolated and estranged from most of his family, Wills had become, in the words of cricket historian [[David Frith]], "a complete and dangerous and apparently incurable alcoholic".{{sfn|Frith|2011|p=167}} An oft-repeated story that Wills was housed at [[Kew Asylum|Kew Lunatic Asylum]] near the end of his life is not supported by substantive evidence.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|pp=283–284, 318}} He and Barbor abruptly stopped drinking on 28 April 1880; it is presumed that they ran out of money to buy more alcohol.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=301}} Two days later, Wills started to show signs of [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]], and Barbor, fearing that a calamity was at hand, admitted him to the [[Melbourne Hospital]] on 1 May to be kept under restraint.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=301}} His physician treated him for [[delirium tremens]], but he absconded soon after, returned home and the next day, in the grip of paranoid delusions, committed suicide by stabbing a pair of scissors into his heart three times.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|pp=266–268}} The inquest, on 3 May, presided over by coroner [[Richard Youl]], found that Wills "killed himself when of unsound mind from excessive drinking".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=308–310}} Wills was buried the next day in an unmarked grave in Heidelberg Cemetery at a private funeral attended by only six people: his brother Egbert, sister Emily and cousin Harrison; Harrison's sister Adela and her son Amos; and cricketer [[Verney Cameron]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=310}} His death certificate declared that his parents were unknown.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=291}} When asked by a journalist about her late son, Elizabeth Wills is reported to have denied that Tom ever existed.{{Ref_label|E|e|none}}

Wills struck his contemporaries as peculiar and at times [[narcissistic]], with a prickly temperament, but also kind, charismatic and companionable.{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=3|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=xvii|3a1=Blainey|3y=2003|3p=8}} Often embroiled in controversy, he seemed to lack an understanding of how his words and actions could repeatedly get him into trouble.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=193}} His obsession with sport was such that he showed little interest in anything else.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Through his research, journalist [[Martin Flanagan (journalist)|Martin Flanagan]] concluded that Wills was "utterly bereft of insight into himself",{{sfn|Judd|2007|p=151}} and football historian Gillian Hibbins described Wills as "an overbearing and undisciplined young man who tended to blame others for his troubles and was more interested in winning a game than in respecting sporting rules."{{sfn|Hibbins|2008|pp=38–39}} Wills' family and peers, though angered by his misbehaviour, frequently forgave him.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=108}} It is unlikely that he sought popular favour, but his strong egalitarian streak helped solidify his folk hero status.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=78, 237}} This affection for him, coupled with an understanding of his waywardness, found expression in the public motto: "With all thy faults I love thee still, Tommy Wills".{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=235}}

As a young adult back in Australia, Wills developed a peculiar [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] style of writing that sometimes defied [[syntax]] and [[grammar]].{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=xvii, 69}} While he spoke in a breezy and laconic manner,{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=185}} his letters are laced with puns, oblique [[Classics|classical]] and [[:wikt:Shakespearean|Shakespearean]] allusions, and droll asides, such as this one about Melbourne in a letter to his brother Cedric: "Everything is dull here, but people are kept alive by people getting shot at in the streets".{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=184}} The overall effect is one of "a mind full of energy and histrionic ideas without a centre".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=69}}
{{Quote|text=He could be dismissive, triumphant and brazen all within a single sentence. Whatever his inner world was, he rarely let it be known.

His punctuation was idiosyncratic. Language was breathless and explosive and he revelled in presenting himself and his motives as mysterious.|sign=Greg de Moore{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=184}}}}

In one of his borderline "thought disordered" letters, it is evident that at times he entered a state of [[depersonalisation]]: "I do not know what I am standing on ... when anyone speaks to me I cannot for the life of me make out what they are talking about—everything seems so curious."{{sfnm|1a1=de Moore|1y=2008|1p=184|2a1=de Moore|2y=2011|2p=66}} In 1884, Hammersley compared Wills' incipient madness and fiery glare to that of [[Adam Lindsay Gordon]],{{Ref_label|F|f|none}} the Australian [[bush poet]].{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=299}} Wills' mental instability is a source for speculation: [[epilepsy]] has been suggested as a possible cause of his perplexed mental state, and a variant of [[bipolar illness]] may account for his disjointed thinking and flowery, confused writings.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=68, 335}}

In 1923, the MCC discovered Wills' old [[cricket cap]] and put it on display in the [[Block Arcade]], prompting Horace Wills to reflect: "My brother was the nicest man I ever met. Though his nature was care-free, amounting almost to wildness, he had the sweetest temper I have seen in a man, and was essentially a sportsman."{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=317–318}}

The greatest all-rounder of his era, Wills saw himself principally as a bowler.

''The Sydney Morning Herald'' (Sydney). 17 December 1888. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stiff and "peculiarly ugly" with the bat, Wills was a dogged stonewaller; his characteristic shots—[[batting (cricket)#cuts|cut]]s and to the [[leg side]]—ensured the primacy of defence.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=40}} He explained his technique thus: "The ball can't get through the bat."&lt;ref&gt;"Cricket". ''[[Otago Witness]]'' (Dunedin). 7 January 1887. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; He also possessed a capacity for explosive batting, and, according to a contemporary, could "hit as hard as [boxer] [[Tom Sayers]]". On one occasion at the MCG, Wills made a drive into the Richmond Paddock for eight runs. It took two fielders to throw the ball back to wicket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/133435472 "Eighty-six Not Out"].

Since the 1980s, it has been suggested that Wills played or observed an Aboriginal football game, [[Marngrook]],{{Ref_label|G|g|none}} as a child growing up in the Grampians among the Djab wurrung, and incorporated some of its features into early Australian football.{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|2009|p=8}} The theory has provoked intense debate, amounting to a controversy dubbed "football's [[history wars]]".{{sfn|Hocking|Reidy|2016}} In her essay "A Seductive Myth", published in the AFL's ''The Australian Game of Football Since 1858'' (2008), Hibbins calls the proposed link an "emotional belief" lacking "any intellectual credibility".{{sfn|Hibbins|2008|p=45}} She points out that neither Wills nor any of his fellow football founders mention Aboriginal games in existing documents, and states that there is no evidence of Marngrook being played in the vicinity where Wills grew up.{{sfn|Hibbins|2008|p=45}} Since then, among the personal papers of ethnographer [[Alfred William Howitt]], an interview has been found with a [[Wergaia|Mukjarrawaint]] man who recalls playing Marngrook in the Grampians.{{sfn|Hocking|Reidy|2016}} Also, in his first-hand account of Aboriginal games, [[James Dawson (activist)|James Dawson]], an Aboriginal rights activist, records the Djab wurrung word for football as "Min'gorm".{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=97}} De Moore therefore argues that Marngrook was likely played around where Wills lived as a boy, "or, at the very least, that the local Aboriginal people knew of such a game". That Wills knew of Marngrook, he adds, is speculative at best.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=323}}

Proponents of a link point to the games' similarities, such as [[Punt (Australian football)|drop punting]] the ball and [[spectacular mark|leaping, catching feats]].{{sfn|Hocking|Reidy|2016}} Academics [[Jenny Hocking]] and Nell Reidy write that Wills, in adapting football to Melbourne's parklands, wanted a game that kept the players off the ground and the ball in the air. "It is here", they argue, "in the interstices between rugby and Australian football, that the influence of [Marngrook] can be seen most clearly".{{sfn|Hocking|Reidy|2016}} Historian [[John Hirst (historian)|John Hirst]] countered that early Australian football was aligned with rugby-style roots, and bore little resemblance to Marngrook.{{sfn|Hirst|2010|p=55}} According to de Moore, Wills was "almost solely influenced" by Rugby School football, with local conditions also having an effect.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=323}}

Flanagan promoted the Marngrook theory in his novel ''[[The Call (Martin Flanagan novel)|The Call]]'' (1996), an historical imagining into Wills' life,{{sfn|Flanagan|2011}} and argued in an essay addressed to Wills that he must have known Aboriginal games as it was in his nature to play: "There's two things about you everybody seems to have agreed on—you'd drink with anyone and you'd play with anyone."{{sfn|Flanagan|2008|p=543}} He quotes Lawton Wills Cooke, a descendent of Horace Wills (Tom's brother), who said a family story had been passed down about Tom playing Marngrook as a boy.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Martin (27 December 2008).

The role that Wills and others played in pioneering Australian football went largely unrecognised in their lifetimes as the sport had yet to develop a historical perspective.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=324}} In an 1876 piece on the Melbourne Football Club's origins, published in ''The Australasian'', Wills' 1858 letter calling for the organisation and codification of football was noted as a seminal document.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/142158224 "THE ORIGIN OF THE MELBOURNE CLUB"]. ''The Australasian'' (Melbourne). 26 February 1876. p. 13.

C. A. Harrison was proclaimed "the father of football" on account of his substantial reputation on and off the field.{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|2009|pp=12–13}} Wills was the next most often recalled pioneer during this period,{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=323–324}} and Harrison credited him with initiating the sport when he "recommended that we Australians should work out a game of our own."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, H. C. A. (12 August 1914). [http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/155522568 "Australian Game: Its Birth in the Commonwealth"]. ''Winner'' (Melbourne). p. 8. Retrieved 3 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent historiography has shown that while Harrison was a pivotal figure over a long period, he did not co-write the first rules in 1859 and did not play in the 1858 games. With this correction, Wills was elevated to a position of pre-eminence.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=324}} He has variously been called the game's father and inventor.{{sfnm|1a1=Molony|1y=2000|1p=145|2a1=Hess|2y=2008|2p=26}} Blainey said of Wills: "It is far too much to say that he founded the game, but it would be too little to say that he was simply one among many founders."{{sfn|Blainey|2003|p=206}}

It is often said that, due to his suicide, Wills was written out of the game's history, or at the very least downplayed as an important figure. De Moore has challenged this view by noting that it was the contributions of Hammersley, Smith, Thompson and other pioneers, rather than those of Wills, that were generally overlooked.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=324}} In her analysis of early football, Hibbins concludes that Thompson's journalistic ability as a promoter of the game "probably" makes him the most significant pioneer, and that the importance of Wills' role has been over-emphasised.{{sfn|Hibbins|2008|p=32, 41}} Echoing Hibbins' arguments, Roy Hay writes that Wills, while a "catalyst" for football, was "much more interested in playing and performing than in organising".{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=29}} British historian [[Tony Collins (historian)|Tony Collins]] even compared Wills to [[William Webb Ellis]] and [[Abner Doubleday]], the apocryphal inventors of rugby and baseball respectively.{{sfn|Collins|2011|p=11}} In response to Collins' suggestion that Wills "quickly faded from the footballing scene", [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] journalist [[James Coventry]] drew attention to his seventeen-year playing career (by far the longest of the pioneers), the influence he wielded as captain-coach of various clubs for much of that time, and his administrative work. He concludes that Collins and other scholars have "perversely" devalued Wills' real contributions "in their rush to discredit [the Marngrook theory]".{{sfn|Coventry|2015|pp=28–29}}

Wills: A Biographical Sketch|1869 biographical piece]] in which William Hammersley, the author, states that Wills had furnished him with notes.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=328}} A common alternative is [[Parramatta]].{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=171}} When Victorians claimed Wills as one of theirs, he liked to boast that he was a "Sydney man"—a reference to the colony of his birth.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=81–82}}

'''b.''' {{Note_label|B|b|none}} Tom had eight siblings: Emily Spencer Wills (1842–1925), Cedric Spencer Wills (1844–1914), Horace Spencer Wills (1847–1928), Egbert Spencer Wills (1849–1931), Elizabeth Spencer Wills (1852–1930), Eugenie Spencer Wills (1854–1937), Minna Spencer Wills (1856–1943) and Hortense Sarah Spencer Wills (1861–1907).{{sfn|Wills Cooke|2012|p=250}}

'''c.''' {{Note_label|C|c|none}} Wills and H. C. A. Harrison shared Sarah Howe as a grandmother.{{sfn|Hibbins|Mancini|1987|p=5}} Harrison was born ten months after Wills in New South Wales and as a young boy overlanded to the Port Phillip District, where he often visited the Wills family at Lexington.{{sfn|Blainey|2003|p=68–69}} They became brothers-in-law in 1864 when Harrison married Emily Wills.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=172–173}}

'''d.''' {{Note_label|D|d|none}} The Aborigines went by sobriquets given to them by their European employers in the Western District.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|p=192}} In Mullagh's case, he was named after the station where he worked.{{sfn|Mallett|2002|p=18}}

'''e.''' {{Note_label|E|e|none}} This story was related in the following piece of Wills family oral history: "Elizabeth Wills refused to attend [the funeral] nor would she acknowledge Tom after his death as she was very religious and considered [suicide] a great sin. ... A reporter asked Elizabeth about her son. 'Which son?' she asked. 'Thomas' said the reporter. 'I have no son called Thomas' was the old lady's reply".{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=303}}

'''f.''' {{Note_label|F|f|none}} Gordon suffered a demise similar to that of Wills, committing suicide in 1870.{{sfn|de Moore|2008|p=299}} He describes Wills as a fearsome bowler in his 1865 long poem "Ye Wearie Wayfarer".{{sfn|Blainey|2003|p=210}}

'''g.''' {{Note_label|G|g|none}} Each Indigenous language group played its own variant of football and with its own name.{{sfn|Hocking|Reidy|2016}} "Marngrook", from the [[Gunditjmara]] [[Kuurn Kopan Noot language|language]], is used as a generic term for Aboriginal football.{{sfn|Hirst|2010|p=54}}

'''Walter Fox McKeithen''' (September 8, 1946 &amp;ndash; July 16, 2005) served five terms as [[Secretary of State of Louisiana]] between 1988 and 2005. He is best known for merging the state's election divisions into one department and for the promotion of historical preservation.

==Early life and education==
McKeithen was born in rural [[Columbia, Louisiana]] to [[John McKeithen|John Julian McKeithen]] and the former Marjorie Howell Funderburk. According to his tombstone, he was named for two [[World War II]] heroes, Walter Bennett and Elmer Fox. He graduated as class president in 1964 from Caldwell Parish High School, the same month in which his father was inaugurated as [[Governors of Louisiana|governor of Louisiana]]. One of his classmates was future associate justice of the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]], [[Chet D. Traylor]]. McKeithen attended [[Louisiana Tech University]] in [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] in [[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana|Lincoln Parish]] to obtain a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[history]] and [[social studies]].

After graduating from Louisiana Tech, McKeithen returned to Caldwell Parish High School, located off [[U.S. Route 165]], as a civics teacher and [[coach (sport)|coach]]. He also established three businesses in Caldwell Parish.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Democrat for secretary of state, 1987==
In 1983, McKeithen was elected to the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] when the incumbent [[Thomas "Bud" Brady]] of [[La Salle Parish, Louisiana|La Salle Parish]] was shifted into District 22, where he defeated sitting Representative [[Richard S. Thompson]] and former legislator [[W.L. Rambo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10221983/10221983_Legislative.html|title=Louisiana primary election returns, October 22, 1983|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11191983/11191983_42239.html|title=Louisiana general election returns, November 19, 1983|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1987, McKeithen was elected secretary of state. In the [[nonpartisan blanket primary]], McKeithen led with 462,965 votes (34 percent) to 365,151 (27 percent) for his principal challenger, fellow Democrat Mike Cutshaw, an attorney for the Louisiana Bankers Association. Two [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates, M. A. "Mike" Tassin and Bobby A. Patrick,&lt;ref&gt;"Secretary of State's post a stepping stone?", ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', October 18, 1987, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; shared 13 percent of the vote, and two other Democrats held a combined 19 percent. Three "no party" candidates polled 8 percent. In the [[general election]], McKeithen only narrowly prevailed over Cutshaw, 490,190 (51 percent) to 467,582 (49 percent).&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Secretary of State, Primary election returns, October 24, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republican for Secretary of State, 1991==

In the summer of 1989, McKeithen switched to the Republican Party, whose chairman, [[William "Billy" Nungesser]], had courted him for a possible 1990 campaign for the [[United States Senate]] against the Democrat [[Bennett Johnston|J. Bennett Johnston, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;"Republicans courting McKeithen", ''Minden Press-Herald'', July 14, 1989, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Upon making the party switch, the GOP helped McKeithen pay off $400,000 in campaign debts.&lt;ref&gt;"GOP wins McKeithen", ''Minden Press-Herald'', July 27, 1989, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

McKeithen announced that he would run for the Senate&lt;ref&gt;"McKeithen challenges Johnston", ''Minden Press-Herald'', November 7, 1989, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; but dropped such plans when the Republican state convention on January 13, 1990, endorsed [[Louisiana State Senate|State Senator]] [[Ben Bagert]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] as the party's preferred candidate. Ultimately, Johnston was reelected in a showdown with another Republican, the maverick [[David Duke]], a former figure in the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Bagert left the race two days before the election at the request of national Republican leaders, who endorsed Johnston over Duke. In the 1972 general election, John McKeithen had run as an [[Independent (politics)|Independent]] for the Senate in an unsuccessful race against Johnston. Fox McKeithen's father and daughter, Marjorie A. McKeithen (born 1965), both opposed the party switch and remained Democrat.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1991, McKeithen faced a close contest for reelection as secretary of state. Two Democrats, Mary Chehardy (later a Republican) and Doug Schmidt, challenged him. McKeithen led in the primary, with 629,237 votes (46 percent) to Schmidt's 387,243 (28 percent). Close behind was Chehardy with 357,173 (26 percent). Schmidt, who used the expression "Get the Fox out of the Henhouse", advanced to the general election against McKeithen. In the showdown, McKeithen prevailed by 9,151 votes, a margin similar to [[David C. Treen]]'s plurality over Democrat [[Louis Lambert]] in the 1979 gubernatorial contest. Returns gave McKeithen 827,506 votes to Schmidt's 818,355.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In subsequent elections, McKeithen was often endorsed by Democrats and worked well with members from both parties. His folksy manner meant that he was generally popular with voters despite adopting such unpopular positions as raising the pay of elected state officials. In his last race in 2003, he even carried the endorsement of [[organized labor]], which rarely supports Republicans. During January 2004, McKeithen supervised the combining of the former elections department into the secretary of state's office.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

A few weeks later, when voting machines were slow to arrive in [[New Orleans]] in time for the 2004 elections, he helped to deliver them himself. McKeithen's gravestone in Caldwell Parish lists his principal accomplishments as the restoration of the Old State Capitol in Baton Rouge, the Cotton Museum in [[Lake Providence, Louisiana|Lake Providence]], the [[Delta Music Museum]] in [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]], and the Louisiana Exhibition Building in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Death==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
After a fall in the garage of his home in Baton Rouge in February 2005, McKeithen was hospitalized with paralysis from the neck down. Trouble struck again, and he re-entered the hospital on June 21 with a serious infection caused from the fall. He resigned as secretary of state on July 15, 2005, and died just a few hours later. He left his state pension to his widow, Yvonne Y. McKeithen.

[[Al Ater|Alan Ray Ater]], a former state representative from [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]] in [[Concordia Parish]] became the acting secretary of state on McKeithen's death by virtue of having been the first deputy secretary of state. Ater did not seek the position in the [[special election]] held on September 30, 2006, to fill the remaining fifteen months of McKeithen's term. Late in 2006, Ater hence turned over the office to Republican state Senator [[Jay Dardenne]] (pronounced DAR DEN) of Baton Rouge. Dardenne was declared the winner of the special election after the runner-up candidate, outgoing Democratic state Senator [[Francis C. Heitmeier]] of [[New Orleans]] withdrew from a pending [[runoff election]], which would have coincided with the November 7 national general election. In the September 30 election, Dardenne led with 30 percent of the vote. He ran up large margins in the greater Baton Rouge area and finished second in other portions of the state. Heitmeier, who ran best in [[Liberalism|liberal]] and labor areas of the state, trailed with 28 percent.

A third candidate, the [[conservatism|conservative]] former Louisiana Republican State Chairman [[Mike Francis (politician)|Mike Francis]] of [[Crowley, Louisiana|Crowley]] in [[Acadia Parish]], finished with 26 percent of the ballots. He ran well in Acadiana and his native north Louisiana — he is originally from [[Jena, Louisiana|Jena]] in [[La Salle Parish]] - but trailed badly in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and the [[Florida Parishes]].

==Legacy==
In 2006, McKeithen was inducted [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] into the [[Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame]] in Winnfield, an honor that his father had procured in 1993, having been among the first thirteen honorees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56774">In the early 1960s, an interest in women and their connection with the environment was sparked, largely by a book written by [[Esther Boserup]] entitled ''Woman's Role in Economic Development''.&lt;ref name=Tiondi&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Tiondi, T.|year=2001|title= Women, environment and development: Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America|type=Theses and Dissertations|id=Paper 1549|url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1980s, policy makers and governments became more mindful of the connection between the environment and gender issues.&lt;ref name=GDRC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Development Research Center|url=http://www.gdrc.org/|accessdate=2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes began to be made regarding natural resource and environmental management with the specific role of women in mind.  According to the World Bank in 1991, "Women play an essential role in the management of natural resources, including soil, water, forests and energy...and often have a profound traditional and contemporary knowledge of the natural world around them".&lt;ref name=WorldBanK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdrc.org/gender/gender-envi.html|title=Gender and the Environment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas women were previously neglected or ignored, there was increasing attention paid to the impact of women on the natural environment and, in return, the effects the environment has on the health and well-being of women. The gender-environment relations have valuable ramifications in regard to the understanding of nature between men and women, the management and distribution of resources and responsibilities and the day-to-day life and well being of people.&lt;ref name=Env&amp;Planning&gt;Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 2011, volume 29, pages 237-253&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's connection with the environment==

===Women, environment and development (WED) debate===

Different discourses have shaped the way that sustainable development is approached, and as time goes on women have become more integrated in shaping these ideas. The definition of sustainable development is highly debated itself, but is defined by Harcourt as a way to "establish equity between generations" and to take into account "social, economic, and environmental needs to conserve non-renewable resources" and decrease the amount of waste produced by industrialization.&lt;ref name=harcourt&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harcourt|first1=Wendy|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sustainable Development.|date=1994|publisher=International Society for Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first discourse that emerged in relation to women was Women in Development (WID), the perspective that advocated for women's status to be improved in developing countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development and Globalization: Economics as if all people mattered|last=Beneria|first=Lourdes|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0415537490|location=New York|pages=1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then transformed into Women, Environment, and Development (WED). Critiques for WID included its place in a larger western mindset, perpetuating a colonial and liberal discourse that was not compatible with supporting the global population of women. WID placed women as central actors in household, rural and market economies and looked to the hierarchical institution of western development to fix the issues that arise because of this.&lt;ref name=harcourt /&gt;

The next shift in discourse took place in the early 1970s, where people began to critique the roots of development and start to look at alternative ways to go about interacting with the global community and developing countries, with women and the environment as central actors. This was defined as Women, Environment, Development (WED).&lt;ref name=braid&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braidotti|first1=Rosi|title=Women, the Environment, and Sustainable Development|date=1994|publisher=Zed Books in association with INSTRAW}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schultz et al., "The women, environment and development debate (WED-debate) is anchored in a critical view of development policies where the link between modernization/industrialization and technology on the one hand and environmental deterioration on the other is focused".&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz et al.|first1=Irmgard|title=Research on Gender, the Environment and Sustainable Development|journal=Institut für sozial-ökologische|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; WED discourse is centralized around the synthesis of different ideologies, one of which being ecofeminism.&lt;ref name=leach&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leach|first1=Melissa|title=. Earth Mother Myths and Other Ecofeminist Fables: How a Strategic Notion Rose and Fell.|journal=Development and Change|date=January 31, 2007|volume=38|issue=1|page=67-85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecofeminism may be seen as a root ideology for WED, whereas women are viewed with a biological connection to nature that enables them to have a deeper connection and stewardship of it. This ideology was transformed into the political sphere where it took a new shape as women having a socially constructed connection to nature through our global systems.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt;

Programs started in the 1990s based on the WED discourse and were instituted by the United Nations International Research Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW). These programs were in response to the relation between gender and environmental violences such as waste disposal, pesticide use nuclear testing and other detrimental environmental practices.&lt;ref name=braid /&gt;

The outcome of many of these programs did not produce the desired impacts on women.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt; The WED discourse placed emphasis on women as solution holders to environmental issues but policies were not directed at empowering women, rather the sectors that women are involved in, such as agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Missing Women in Agriculture Reforms|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=February 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leach argues that the overall impact of politicizing the role of women and the environment through the WED discourse appropriated women's labor without providing proper resources or capacity to succeed.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt;

=== Farming and agriculture ===
{{See also|Feminization of agriculture}}

In a majority of the world, women are responsible for farm work and related domestic food production.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|date=Spring 1992|title=The gender and environment debate: lessons from India|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=18|issue=1|jstor=3178217|doi=10.2307/3178217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243764296_The_Gender_and_Environment_Debate_Lessons_from_India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=1998|title=Disinherited peasants, disadvantaged workers: a gender perspective on land and livelihood|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=33|number=13 (Mar. 26 – Apr. 3, 1998)|pp=A2–A1|jstor=4406578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jiggins&gt;{{cite book|author=Jiggins, J. |year=2004|title=Changing the boundaries: Women-centered perspectives on population &amp; the environment|location= Covelo, Ca|publisher=Island Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lastarria-Cornhiel&gt;{{cite book|author=Lastarria-Cornhiel, S.|year=2006|title=Feminization of Agriculture: Trends and Driving Forces|location=Santiago|publisher= RIMISP}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of women are taking over and expanding their involvement in [[agricultural]] tasks but this has not changed the gender division of labor with regard to reproductive work.&lt;ref name=Lastarria-Cornhiel /&gt;  Esther Boserup looked into the farming systems of men and women in [[Africa]] and found that "in many African tribes, nearly all the tasks connected with food production continue to be left to women".&lt;ref name=Boserup&gt;Boserup, E. (1970). Woman's Role in Economic Development.  Male and female farming systems  (15-65).&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz ''et al.'' (2001), found that "90% of women in the developing world, where most of the planet's biological wealth is found, depend on their land for survival. Women head 30% of the households in developing countries, 80% of food production in sub-Saharan Africa is done by women, 60% in [[Asia]] and 50% in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; Even though women are largely responsible for the actual agricultural work performed, men, generally own the land, therefore controlling women's labor upon the land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; 

====Africa====
Esther Boserup examined the farming systems of men and women in Africa and found that "in many African tribes, nearly all the tasks connected with food production continue to be left to women".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; In Botswana, men typically have greater access to advanced technologies and plowing abilities.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Zambia also has a high percentage of women farmers yet they are not explicitly recognize and often neglected entirely.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;  Consistent lack of access to credit, mobility, technological advancements, and land ownership further complicate women's agricultural roles. A group of women in Kenya began farming trees way before climate change was prioritized because they had seen what happens to lands that are depleted of its nutrients and the adverse effects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steady|first=Filomina Chioma|date=2014|title=Women, Climate Change, and Liberation in Africa|url=http://libproxy.sdsu.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1690372156?accountid=13758|journal=Race, Gender &amp; Class|volume=21|pages=312-333|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Latin American and Caribbean====
In Peru, women often participate in food production and family farming yet they do not generally benefit directly from their labor.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Their work is not considered as valuable as men's.  Women in the Caribbean have always been associated with agriculture and do have access to land ownership.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; However, women still do not have the same access to technology as men and generally have smaller plots of land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; 

The dependence on nature and the environment for survival is common among Third World women.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; It has been argued by environmental feminists&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; that this dependence creates a deeply rooted connection between women and their surroundings.  The dependency women have on natural resources, based on their responsibilities, creates a specific interest that may be different from the interests of men.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;  Jiggins et al. suggests that the views women have on nature are unique in that they connect the land to immediate survival and concern for future generations rather than simply looking at the land as a resource with monetary value.&lt;ref name=Jiggins /&gt; With the development of newer technologies since the 1940s, there has been a shift to more non-farm activities, however, men more than women are the ones participating in the shift, leaving women behind.&lt;ref name=Boserup /&gt; It has been projected that the continuation of men shifting to urban livelihoods, more and more women will be depended on to maintain the household by farming.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;Especially during the neoliberal policy regime in Latin America, with the increasing use of exports, women were ideal for their ‘gendered skills,’ they were paid less for their farming labor and not likely to organize, coining the term ‘feminization of responsibility.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development and Globalization: Economics as if All People Mattered|last='Beneria'; 'Berik'; 'Floro'|first='Lourdes'; 'Gunseli'; 'Maria'|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues such as climate change could have a greater impact on women because the land they farm will be negatively affected.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

====Asia and Pacific Islands====
In the Asian and Pacific Island regions, 58% of women involved in the economy are found in the agriculture sector. This involves work in own-account farms, labor in small enterprises for processing fruits, vegetables and fish, paid and unpaid work on other peoples land, and collecting forest products.&lt;ref name=ESCAP&gt;{{cite book|last1=United Nations, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|title=Gender, the Environment and Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific|date=2017|publisher=United Nations ESCAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Out of all the women working in this sector, 10–20% have been found to have tenure to the land they work on.  Reasons for this number include economic and legal barriers. For example, in terms of loans women are found to get fewer and less loans to acquire land then men.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

One other factor that plays into women’s land rights for agriculture is the cultural norms of the area.  In the Asian and the Pacific women’s societal rolls have been defined by patriarchal norms of the larger global society, where men are viewed as breadwinners and women are viewed as caretakers. This can be expressed through the number of hours women spend doing unpaid care work per day. In developing countries in total, women spend 4 hours and 30 minutes of care work a day versus the 1 hour and 2 minutes that men spend.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

===Land ownership and property management===

In many parts of the world, specifically developing countries, there is a great deal of inequality when it comes to land ownership.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; Traditional practices and bureaucratic factors often prevent women's access to natural resource development and management.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Frequently, women do not have the right to own land and/or property, but they often are the ones who tend to the land. [[Bina Agarwal]], has written a great deal about gender and land rights in Third World countries and according to her, "Hence, insofar as there is a gender and class-based division of labor and distribution of property and power, gender and class structure people's interactions with nature and so structure the effects of environmental change on people and their responses to it."&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; Women's access to control of natural resources, land ownership and property management is a developing issue and is the subject of continuous debate in both the environmental realm and women's rights movement.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

===Women's property status and the likelihood of violence===
"World wide, physical violence by husbands against wives is estimated to range between 10% and 50% (p824)".&lt;ref name=P&amp;A&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Panda, P.|author2=Agarwal, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title= Marital violence, human development and women's property status in India|journal=World Development|volume=33|issue=5|pp=823–850|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is difficult to pinpoint the causes of marital violence but economic dependence is widely acknowledged as one of the main sources. Land or property ownership provides women who may be experiencing marital violence with a credible exit option.  Land ownership creates a means of production of both income and power.&lt;ref name=Chowdhry&gt;{{cite web|author=Chowdhry, P.|year=2011|title= Reduction of Violence Against Women: Property Ownership &amp; Economic Independence in Rural Haryana|publisher=UN Women|url=http://www.unwomensouthasia.org/assets/Violence-Property-Rights2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study performed in Kerala, India examined the effects of property status and the likelihood of violence against women.  Close to 500 women were surveyed about a number of happenings in the household such as the amount of longterm and current violence that occurred, women's ownership of the land or house, and other sociodemographic characteristics.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; The violence that occurs can be physical, such as hitting or kicking or psychological, such as threats or belittlement. Long-term violence, or violence that had been occurring throughout the entirety of the marriage, was experienced by 41% of women in rural households, while 27% of urban household women reported violence in various forms. Current violence, or violence occurring within 12 months of the time of survey was experienced by 29% in a physical capacity and 49% experienced psychological violence.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt;

Of all the women surveyed, 35% did not own any property and of that 35%, 49% experienced physical violence while 84% experienced psychological violence.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; The amount of violence was significantly lower in households where women owned land or property.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; According to this particular study, women's access to land and property ownership reduces the risk of spousal abuse by enhancing the livelihood of women as well as providing an escape route and means for survival if abuse begins.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; In many developing countries, where marital violence is prominent, barriers such as unequal laws and social and administrative bias&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; keep women from owning land and property.  A vast number of women are left out of owning immovable property (land or house) furthering their likelihood of experiencing marital violence.&lt;ref name=Chowdhry /&gt; (Chowdhry). It can also be argued that land rights greatly shape an individuals relationship with nature and the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;

===Relationship between violence of nature and women===

The WED debate has examined the correlation between the degradation of the environment and the subordination of women.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; [[Carolyn Merchant]] and [[Vandana Shiva]] wrote that there is a connection between dominance of women and dominance of nature. Shiva said, "The rupture within nature and between man and nature, and its associated transformation from a life-force that sustains to an exploitable resource characterizes the Cartesian view which has displaced more ecological world-views and created a development paradigm which cripples nature and woman simultaneously".&lt;ref name=Shiva&gt;Shiva, V. (1988). Staying Alive, London: Zed.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploitation of women's labor as well as the abuse of natural environment are connected as they are both marginalized within the economy. Both the environment and women have been viewed as exploitable resources that are significantly undervalued.&lt;ref name=Perkins /&gt; This argument supports ecofeminism in that women in developing countries rely on nature to survive, therefore, destruction of the environment results in elimination of women's method to survival.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; According to Jiggins, environmental degradation effects women the most, furthering the inequalities between men and women.&lt;ref name=Jiggins /&gt; One study showed that new developments in technology and developments in land access are denied to women, furthering their subordination and inequality.&lt;ref name=Nightingale&gt;}{{cite journal|author1=Nightingale, A.|year=2006|title=The nature of gender: work, gender, and environment|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|volume=24|issue=2|pp= 165–185|url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/rgroves/nightingalepub1.pdf|doi=10.1068/d01k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical perspectives==

===Ecofeminism===
[[Ecofeminism]] says that women are closer to nature than men are. This closeness, therefore, makes women more nurturing and caring towards their environment.  Ecofeminism encompasses a variety of views but has a focus of patriarchal oppression and the social constructions relating to women and the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Some indicate the biology of women as the reason behind the closeness, while others credit culture and historical factors.&lt;ref name=Agarwal2000&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=2000|title= Conceptualising environmental collective action: why gender matters|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics|volume=24|issue=3|pp=283–310|doi=10.1093/cje/24.3.283|url=http://binaagarwal.com/downloads/apapers/conceptualizing_environmental_collective_action.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ecofeminist believes in a direct connection between oppression of nature and the subordination of women. Vandana Shiva, is credited with bringing ecofeminism into public consciousness by her reports of the [[Chipko]] movement.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;
The Chipko movement also led to the formation of anti alcoholism.

===Environmental or ecological feminism===

Environmental or ecological feminism differs from ecofeminism in that it is more focused on the actual, specific interactions with the environment. Connections between environment and gender can be made by looking at the gender division of labor and environmental roles rather than an inherent connection with nature.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; The gender division of labor requires a more nurturing and caring role for women, therefore that caring nature places women closer with the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; The knowledge of nature is shaped by the experiences an individual has.  Women have a distinct knowledge of the land, yet are excluded from policy decisions of development on that land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; This is prominent in many developing countries where the responsibility of collecting fuel and fodder is placed upon the women.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; Both the resources and the meanings are taken into consideration with environmental feminism. There is a challenge to not only focus on the gender division of labor but also the actual appropriation methods of the resources.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; In other words, there is not simply an inherent connection between women and nature, rather there are material realities that exist.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; Bina Agarwal&lt;ref name=Agarwal1997&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=1998|title=Gender and environment management in South Asia: can romanticized pasts help model desirable futures?|journal=Macalester International|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1132&amp;context=macintl}} Article 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes ecofeminism and outlines three problematic elements which are:
*Historical characterization of the situation of women and nature
*Linking of the emancipation of women with that of nature
*Assumptions about women's agency

====Criticism====
[[Bina Agarwal]] has critiqued the ideas of environmental feminism. She proposes problems with welfare, efficiency, and source of land. 
*Welfare

Due to gender differences in income-spending patterns, women are at a higher risk of living in poverty. For this reason, access to land is of special importance. Land access allows for a number of production advantages such as growing trees, fodder and/or crops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www-fulcrum-org.libproxy.sdsu.edu/concern/monographs/bg257f65x|title=A Field of One's Own|last=Agarwal|first=Bina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=0521418682|location=Cambridge, England|pages=pg. 32 &amp; pp.37-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, land access also allows for increased credit, bargaining power and strengthens aggregate real wages rates.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even the smallest amount of land can have huge impacts on welfare directly as well as increasing entitlement to family welfare.&lt;ref name=Chada&gt;Chadha, G K (1992). Non-farm Sector in India's Rural Economy: Policy, Performance and Growth Prospects, mimeo, Centre for Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi (1992), showed that households that owned land earned markedly more than landless households.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Efficiency
#Incentive effect: If women are given secure land rights, there will be a greater incentive for higher production rates.  Women will be motivated to use the best technologies, increase cultivation, and make long-term investments. Environmentally sound use of the land resource and reduced out-migration to cities by women and their dependents are other benefits of women’s secure land rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#Credit and input access effect: "Titles would enhance women's ability to raise production by improving their access to agricultural credit, as well as by increasing women's independent access to output, savings and cash flow for reinvestment".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;
#Efficiency of resource use effect: Studies have shown the possibility that women use resources more efficiently than men.  This could mean anything from making a more productive use of loans of money earned to the ability of women to achieve higher values of output based on cropping patterns.
#Gender specific knowledge and talent pool effect: Many women have specific and often greater knowledge about certain crops and planting patterns.  If women are included as farm managers, a more diverse and talented informed pool will be created.
#Bargaining power and empowerment effect: Providing women with the opportunity to own land will increase their sense of empowerment and could help women to assert themselves more in various situations such as policy creation other government schemes.

*Source of land
Because public land available for distribution is now quite limited, most of the land will need to come from private sectors.  "To get a share of land, therefore, it is critical for women to stake a claim in privatised land".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;

===Feminist political ecology ===
Feminist political ecology builds from [[ecofeminism]] and environmental feminism and lays out three essential factors which are: 
# [[wiktionary:gendered knowledge|Gendered knowledge]], or the ways in which access to scientific and ecological knowledge is structured by gender (this is considered part of [[gender feminism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |subscription=yes |jstor=40435825|title=Public Affairs Quarterly Vol. 6, No. 4 |date=October 1992 |pages=435–456 |chapter=Multiculturalism and Epistemology |first=Steven |last=Yates |quote=Feminists offer their distinctive twist to this approach by saying that all knowledge and cognition are "gendered"; hence the term gender feminism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
# Gendered environmental rights and responsibilities, including differential access by men and women to various legal and de facto claims to land and resources.
#Gendered politics and grassroots activism, including an examination of women within and as leaders of environmental movements.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt;

Feminist political ecology seeks to discover the role and place of women in environmental development on a political scale.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt;

==In developed nations==

===Sweden===
Sweden has historically had a political culture that inherently protects the environment. Sweden is one of the highest-ranking countries when assessing gender equality, but the government does agree there is room for improvement. Women in Sweden have been empowered to protect the environment through the government and policies, a lot like other developed nations. In Sweden, the majority of local government workers are women at 64% and since the 2010 election, 45% of Swedish parliament is made up of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Equality in Sweden|url=https://sweden.se/society/gender-equality-in-sweden/|website=Government of Sweden|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has recognized that women are the most affected by climate change and environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denton|first=Fatma|date=July 2002|title=Climate Change Vulnerability, Impacts, and Adaptation: Why Does Gender Matter?|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.sdsu.edu/stable/4030569?seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Gender and Development|volume=10|pages=10-20|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this recognition they have committed to contribute to increasing the participation for women in decisions and policy debates surrounding climate change and other environmental issues. They also have committed to increasing resources for women in civil society who present issues about the environment, hoping to increase accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government offices of Sweden|title=Policy for Environmental and Climate Issues in Swedish Development Cooperation|url=http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/15/64/98/24249736.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson and Merchant draw on the idea that the women's environmental movement in Sweden was based on both symbolic and political perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson &amp; Merchant|title='Peace with the Earth:' Women and the Environmental Movement in Sweden|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|date=1986|issue=9.5–6|pages=465–479}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages of the environmental movement and women’s movement in Sweden, women were very aware that changes had to be made both within society and ideologies, then enacted politically to create a cohesive collective society.

Elin Wagner (1882–1949) presented herself as a radical feminist in early movements. She was a writer, journalist, environmentalist, ecologist and pacifist. She was a large inspiration for the environmental and feminist movements. She saw a large flaw in the popular ideology after World War II: that men had the ability to control and conserve nature for the entire global community or all of mankind. With a place in both politics and writing, she was inspired to write her novel, ''Alarm Clock''. Her novel was barely noticed when released in 1941, but during Sweden's women's movement in the 1970s, her messages became a driving force behind the movement. She believed that there should be a large presence of intellectuals in social movements. Wagner and other key Swedish feminist scholars and intellectuals of that time shaped the parameters of Swedish thinking and both the environmental and women's movements. Throughout her life, Wagner stressed the importance of nature and the environment, an idea we see through the identity of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=A|title=Elin wägner and radical environmentalism in Sweden: The good earthworm|journal=Environmental History Review|date=1994|volume=18|issue=3|pages=59–74|jstor=3984710|doi=10.2307/3984710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden has it ingrained in both their identity and traditions to have a deep sense of nature, which has played a huge role in shaping the overall consensus of the country to protect the environment, especially for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breiting &amp; Wickenberg|title=The progressive development of environmental education in Sweden and Denmark|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the transformation of the opinion and ideologies of the Swedish people, it became much easier to entrench environmental policies. Women working within institutions protected the global environment by pushing for bans on nuclear energy or industry degrading local environment. In 1980, there was a national referendum on nuclear power in Sweden. The voting patterns revealed that 43% of women were against nuclear power, while only 21% of men opposed it.&lt;ref name="Merchant1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merchant|first1=C|title=Earthcare: Women and the Environment|date=1996|location=New York|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden and the women of the country have demonstrated that environmental protection can be achieved through transitioning ideologies followed by institutional change.

==Women's attitude and the environment==
The deep connection between women and men comes from the daily interaction between them.{{citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=March 2009}} In recent decades, environmental movements have increased as the movements for women's rights have also increased.&lt;ref name = "Mellor"&gt;Mellor, Mary.(1997). Feminism &amp; Ecology. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Today's union of nature preservation with [[women's rights]] and [[Women's liberation|liberation]] has stemmed from invasion of their rights in the past.&lt;ref name="Merchant1996"/&gt;

In developing areas of the world, women are considered the primary users of [[natural resources]] (Land, forest, and water), because they are the ones who are responsible for gathering food, fuel, and fodder.&lt;ref name= "Abzug"&gt;Abzug, Bella. (1995). Women and the Environment. International Authors Series. New York: The Department of Public Information.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in these countries, women mostly can't own the land and farms outright, they are the ones who spend most of their time working on the farms to feed the [[household]]. Shouldering this responsibility leads them to learn more about soil, plants, and trees and not misuse them. Although, technological inputs increase male involvement with land, many of them leave the farm to go to cities to find jobs; so women become increasingly responsible for an increasing portion of farm tasks.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"&gt;Jiggins, Janice. (1994). Changing the Boundaries: Women-Centered Perspectives on population and the Environment. New York: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These rural women tend to have a closer relationship with land and other natural resources, which promotes a new culture of respectful use and preservation of natural resources and the environment, ensuring that the following generations can meet their needs.&lt;ref name = "Silent"&gt;From Silent Spring to vocal vanguard. (1997, January). United Nations Chronicle, 34(3), 35-38. Retrieved December 13, 2006, from ProQuest database.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides considering how to achieve appropriate [[agricultural]] production and human nutrition, women want to secure access to the land.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"/&gt; Women's perspectives and values for the environment are somewhat different from men's. Women give greater priority to protection of and improving the capacity of nature, maintaining farming lands, and caring for nature and environment's future.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"/&gt; Repeated studies have shown that women have a stake in environment, and this stake is reflected in the degree to which they care about natural resources. [[Ecofeminism]] refers to women's and feminist perspectives on the environment – where the domination and exploitation of women, of poorly resourced peoples and of nature is at the heart of the ecofeminist movement.

==Climate change and women==
Many of the environmental effects of climate change have disproportionately placed women in more vulnerable circumstances. Environmental occurrences that affect the activities women are found to be mainly responsible for in developing countries include increase in storm frequency and intensity, increase in floods, droughts, and fires. The Indian Government's National Action Plan on Climate Change said "The impacts of climate change could prove particularly severe for women. With climate change there would be increasing scarcity of water, reductions in yields of forest biomass, and increased risks to human health with children, women and the elderly in a household becoming the most vulnerable. ...special attention should be paid to the aspects of gender."&lt;ref name=arora&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonsson-Arora|first1=Seema|title=Virtue and vulnerability: Discourses on women, gender and climate change|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=May 2011|volume=21|issue=2|pages=744–751|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Pacific Islands and coastal areas of Asia women are strongly engaged in subsistence fishing as well as collection of food in local habitats. These habitats, such as [[mangroves]], [[seagrass]] beds, and [[lagoons]] are all being negatively influenced by a changing climate, creating barriers in the direct work of women which then ripple out to their community.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

The subsequent response to the connection between women and climate change has evoked multiple responses in the policy realm.  Policy makers have shifted policy to reflect gender sensitive frameworks to address climate change.&lt;ref name=arora /&gt;
Arora-Jonsson argues that by focusing on the vulnerability of women in relation to climate change, it places more responsibility on women and shifts the narrative to ignore the root causes of the issue, power relations and institutional inequality.&lt;ref name=arora /&gt; The outcome of UN movements and policies for promoting women in areas impacted by climate change such as agriculture have not been scientifically proven to have any beneficial results on women communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Missing Women in Agriculture Reforms|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=2002|volume=37|issue=8|page=679-680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and perception of the environment==
Given the environmental degradation caused while men have had dominance over women, and women's large investment in [[environmental sustainability]], some have theorized that women would protect the Earth better than men if in power. Although there is no evidence for this hypothesis, recent movements have shown that women are more sensitive to the earth and its problems. They have created a special [[value system]] about environmental issues. People's approaches to environmental issues may depend on their relationship with nature. Both women and nature have been considered as subordinates entities by men throughout history, which conveys a close affiliation between them.&lt;ref&gt;Wenz, Peter S. (2001). Environmental Ethics Today. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the perception of the natural environment between men and women differs: women tend to perceive natural resources in means of necessity, while men perceive it in means of "commercial entities or income generating tools." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academicresearchjournals.org/IJPSD/PDF/2016/April/Aditya.pdf|title=Role of Women in Environmental Conservation|last=Aditya|first=Sandeep Kumar|date=April 2016|website=Academic Research Journals|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, rural Indian women collect the dead branches which are cut by storm for fuel wood to use rather than cutting the live trees.&lt;ref&gt;Rodda, Annabel. (1991). Women and the Environment. New Jersey: Zed Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Since African, Asian, and Latin American women use the land to produce food for their family, they acquire the knowledge of the land/soil conditions, water, and other environmental features.&lt;ref name="Abzug" /&gt; Any changes in the environment on these areas, like deforestation, have the most effect on women of that area, and cause them to suffer until they can cope with these changes. One of the good examples would be the Nepali women whose grandmothers had to climb to the mountain to be able to bring in wood and fodder.&lt;ref name="Abzug" /&gt;

An example of female prominence in the defense of natural forests comes from India in 1906.  As forest clearing was expanding conflict between loggers and government and peasant communities increased. To thwart resistance to the forest clearing, the men were diverted from their villages to a fictional payment compensation site and loggers were sent to the forests. The women left in the villages, however, protested by physically hugging themselves to the trees to prevent their being cut down, giving rise to what is now called the [[Chipko movement]], an environmentalist movement initiated by these Indian women (which also is where the term tree-huggers originated).&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998"&gt;Breton, Mary J. (1998). Women pioneers for the environment. Boston: Northeastern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict started because men wanted to cut the trees to use them for industrial purposes while women wanted to keep them since it was their food resource and deforestation was a survival matter for local people.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

Gender-based commitments and movements such as [[feminism]] have reached to a new approach through the combination of feminism and [[environmentalism]] called [[Ecofeminism]]. Ecofeminists believe on the interconnection between the domination of women and nature. According to ecofeminism the superior power treats all subordinates the same. So, ecofeminism takes into account women subordination and nature degradation.&lt;ref name = "Mellor" /&gt; Remarking all these different reactions, one can see that however, most policy decision makers are men.

[[Maria Cherkasova]] (b. 1938) is a [[Russia]]n journalist, ecologist, and director of [[Centre for Independent Ecological Programmers]] (CIEP). She is known for coordinating a 4-year campaign to stop construction of hydro-electric dam on the [[Katun River]]. After Cherkasova's involvement in the student movement on environmental protection in the 1960s, she began to work for the [[Red Data Book]] for the Department of Environmental Protection Institute. She researched and preserved rare species until she became the editor of [[USSR]] Red Data Book. She co-founded the [[Socio-Ecological Union]], which has become the largest ecological NGO in the former Soviet Union. In 1990, she became director of CIEP, which arrange and drives activities in an extensive range of ecologically related areas on both domestic and international fronts. Cherkasova recently has shifted her focus on protecting [[children's rights]] to live in a healthy environment and speaks for them both inside and outside Russia.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

===Rachel Carson===
[[Rachel Carson]] (1907–1964) was an [[United States|American]] scientist, writer, and [[ecologist]]. Rachel Carson went to the Pennsylvania College for Women, majoring in English, but she was inspired by her [[biology]] teacher so she switched her major to biology. She became more interested and focused on the sea while she was working at the [[Marine Biological Laboratories in Massachusetts]]. Her eloquent prose let to the publication of her first book, ''[[Under the Sea Wind|Under the Sea-Wind: a Naturalists' Picture of Ocean Life]]'', in 1941. In 1949 she became chief editor of the [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS). Her second book, ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'', won the [[National Book Award]] and sold more than 200,000 copies. After that she retired from FWS and became a full-time writer. After her third and final book about the sea, ''The Edge of the Sea'', Carson focused on effects of chemicals and pesticides on the environment. That is when she wrote her book about environment, ''[[Silent Spring]]''. The book was about what man has done to the nature and eventually to himself, and started a modern environmental movement. Carson believed that humanity and nature are mutually dependent on each other. She argued that industrial activities such as [[pesticides]] use can damages the earth [[ecosystem]] and will have far-reaching ecological consequences such as future human health problems. Today, scientific studies have demonstrated these consequences.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

=== Jane Goodall ===
[[Jane Goodall]] (b. 1934) is a female environmentalist most well known for her chimpanzee study, in which she lived among the primates. She became interested in animals as a young child and spent her early adulthood saving money to fund her dream of taking a trip to Africa. Her position as secretary to Louis Leakey led to her participation in several anthropological digs and animal studies, and eventually she was selected to study chimpanzee behavior in Tanzania. She made several discoveries about the behavior of chimpanzees on these studies and is credited with discovering the chimpanzee behavior of eating meet and creating tools. She published a book about the study entitled ''In the Shadow of Man''. She is also known for her activism, promoting the preservation of wild chimpanzee environments and opposing the use of animals in research. She has received numerous awards for her achievements and owns the Jane Goodall Institute for Wildlife Research, Education, and Conservation, a nonprofit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jane-goodall-9542363#accomplishments|title=Jane Goodall|last=|first=|date=|website=biography.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological movements initiated by women==

===Chipko movement===
One of the first environmentalist movement which was inspired by women was the [[Chipko movement]] (Women tree-huggers in India). "Its name comes from a Hindi word meaning "to stick" (as in glue). The movement was an act of defiance against the state government's permission given to a corporation for commercial logging. Women of the villages resisted, embracing trees to prevent their felling to safeguard their lifestyles which were dependent on the forests. Deforestation could qualitatively alter the lives of all village residents but it was the women who agitated for saving [End Page 163] the forests. Organized by a non-governmental organization that Chandi Prasad Bhatt led, the Chipko movement adopted the slogan "ecology is permanent economy". The women embracing the trees did not tag their action as feminist activism; however, as a movement that demonstrated resistance against oppression, it had all the markings of such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grewal, Jyoti|title=Theorizing Activism, Activizing Theory: Feminist Academics in Indian Punjabi Society|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=20|number=1|pages=161–183|date=Spring 2008|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nwsa_journal/v020/20.1.grewal.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It began when [[Maharajah]] of [[Jodhpur]] wanted to build a new palace in [[Rajasthan]], which is India's [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] foothills. While the [[Lumberjack|axemen]] were cutting the trees, martyr [[Amrita Devi]] hugged one of the trees. This is because in Jodhpur, each child had a tree that could talk to it. The axmen ignored Devi, and after taking her off the tree, cut it down. Her daughters are environmentalists like [[Chandi Prasad Bhatt]] and Sunderlal Bahuguna.

===Green Belt movement===
Another movement, which is one of the biggest in women and environmental history, is the [http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/ Green Belt movement]. [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Wangari Maathai]] founded this movement on the [[World Environment Day]] in June 1977.  The starting ceremony was very simple: a few women planted seven trees in Maathai's backyard. By 2005, 30 million trees had been planted by participants in the Green Belt movement on public and private lands. The Green Belt movement aims to bring environmental restoration along with society's economic growth. This movement led by Maathai focused on restoration of [[Kenya]]'s rapidly diminishing forests as well as empowering the rural women through environmental preservation, with a special emphasis on planting indigenous trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Belt Movement|date=2006|accessdate=November 15, 2006|url= http://www.wangarimaathai.or.ke/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muthuki|first=Janet|date=2006-01-01|title=Challenging patriarchal structures: Wangari Maathai and the Green Belt Movement in Kenya|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233277225_Challenging_patriarchal_structures_Wangari_Maathai_and_the_Green_Belt_Movement_in_Kenya|journal=Agenda|volume=20|pages=83–91|doi=10.1080/10130950.2006.9674752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navdanya Movement===
[[Navdanya]] also known as the 'Nine Seeds Movement' seeks to empower local Indian farmers to move away from growing any [[genetically modified organism]] (GMOs) on their land and return to organic, [[chemical-free]] practices. This movement has reached over 5,000,000 Indian farmers and created over 65 seed banks around India.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{cite web|title=Navdanya|accessdate=March 5, 2012|url= http://www.navdanya.org/home}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navdanya fights to eliminate the [[commercialization of indigenous knowledge]] also known as 'Biopiracy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yamey, Gavin|title=The Bittersweet Sounds of the Modern Food Chain|journal=PLOS Biology|date=February 2006|volume=4|issue=2|pp=0165–0166|accessdate=March 5, 2012|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040047|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navdanya addresses multiple other international issues including climate change, food security, misapplication of technology, food sovereignty, fair trade, and many others.&lt;ref name="home"/&gt; This movement also created a learning center entitled Bija Vidyapeeth. Bija Vidyapeeth, in collaboration with Schumacher College in the United Kingdom, seeks to educate participants in sustainability and ecological principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navdanya|accessdate=March 2, 2012|url= http://www.navdanya.org/earth-university}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenyan land takeover===
In Kenya, starting in the mid-1980s, women protested against the elites and big foreign corporations who were coercing and controlling the production of the land.  Rather than allowing food to be grown for survival, women were pressured by both their husbands and the government to cultivate coffee for foreign profit. Protests continued and gained strength over the next couple of decades.  The protests eventually ended in a Kenyan power shift enforcing democratic national elections which resulted in redistribution of land possible.&lt;ref name=Perkins&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Perkins, E.|author2=Kuiper, E.|author3=Quiroga-Martínez, R.|author4=Turner, T.

Its constituent republics declared independence, despite unresolved tensions between ethnic minorities in the new countries, fueling the wars.

Most of the wars ended through peace accords, involving full international recognition of new states, but with a massive human cost and economic damage to the region. Initially the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) sought to preserve the unity of the whole of Yugoslavia by crushing the secessionist governments but it increasingly came under the influence of the Serbian government of [[Slobodan Milošević]] that evoked [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]] rhetoric and was willing to use the Yugoslav cause to preserve the unity of Serbs in one state. As a result, the JNA began to lose Slovenes, Croats, Kosovar Albanians, Bosniaks, and ethnic Macedonians, and effectively became a Serb army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Judith|last=Armatta|title=Twilight of Impunity: The War Crimes Trial of Slobodan Milosević|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2010|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1994 [[United Nations]] report, the Serb side did not aim to restore Yugoslavia, but to create a "[[Greater Serbia]]" from parts of Croatia and Bosnia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bassiouni|Annex IV – II.

Often described as Europe's deadliest conflicts since [[World War II]], the wars were marked by many [[war crime]]s, including [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]] and [[War rape|rape]]. The [[Bosnian genocide]] was the first European crime since World War II to be formally judged as [[genocide|genocidal]] in character and many key individual participants were subsequently charged with war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.unitedhumanrights.org/Genocide/bosnia_genocide.htm | title = Bosnia Genocide | publisher = United Human Rights Council | accessdate = 13 April 2015 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150413005352/http://www.unitedhumanrights.org/genocide/bosnia_genocide.htm | archivedate = 13 April 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) was established by the UN to prosecute these crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document|docid=S-RES-827(1993)| type=Resolution| body =Security Council|year=1993|resolution_number=827|date=25 May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]], the Yugoslav Wars resulted in the death of 140,000 people.&lt;ref name=ictj/&gt; The [[Humanitarian Law Center]] estimates that in the conflicts in the former Yugoslav republics at least 130,000 people were killed.&lt;ref name=HLC/&gt;

{{Main|Creation of Yugoslavia|Breakup of Yugoslavia}}
[[File:SocialistYugoslavia en.svg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|Map of the six Yugoslav republics and autonomous provinces at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serbia and Kosovo reach EU-brokered landmark accord|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22222624 | accessdate =13 December 2014|agency=BBC|date=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Clear ethnic conflict between the Yugoslav peoples only became prominent in the 20th century, beginning with tensions over the constitution of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] in the early 1920s and escalating into violence between Serbs and Croats in the late 1920s after the assassination of Croatian politician [[Stjepan Radić]]. During [[World War II]] the Croatian [[Ustaše]] committed a number of atrocities [[Persecution of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia|against the Serbs]] and Serbian [[Chetnik]]s [[Chetnik war crimes in World War II|against the Croats and Bosniaks]]. The Yugoslav Partisan movement was able to appeal to all groups, including Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks.&lt;ref name="Judah-BBC-2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/partisan_fighters_01.shtml|publisher=BBC History|title=Partisans: War in the Balkans 1941–1945|first=Stephen A. | last = Hart|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Serbia and Serb-dominated territories, violent confrontations occurred, particularly between nationalists and non-nationalists who criticized the Serbian government and the Serb political entities in Bosnia and Croatia.&lt;ref name="Gagnon-2004"&gt;[[#Gagnon|Gagnon (2004)]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Serbs who publicly opposed the nationalist political climate during the Yugoslav wars were reportedly harassed, threatened, or killed.&lt;ref name="Gagnon-2004"/&gt;

The nation of [[Yugoslavia]] was created in the aftermath of [[World War I]], and it was mostly composed of [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] Christians, but the nation also had a substantial [[Muslim]] minority. This nation lasted from 1918 to 1941, when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded by the Axis powers]] during [[World War II]], which provided support to the [[Ustaše]] (founded in 1929), which conducted a genocidal campaign against Serbs, Jews and Roma inside its territory and the [[Chetniks]], who also conducted their own campaign [[Chetnik war crimes in World War II|of ethnic cleansing and genocide towards ethnic Croats and Bosniaks]], while also supporting the reinstating of the Serbian royals. In 1945, the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY) was established under [[Josip Broz Tito]],&lt;ref name="Judah-BBC-2011"/&gt; who maintained a strongly authoritarian leadership that suppressed [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bassiouni|Annex III – The Balkan wars and the world wars]]&lt;/ref&gt; After Tito's death in 1980, relations among the six republics of the SFRY deteriorated. [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] desired greater autonomy within the Yugoslav confederation, while Serbia sought to strengthen federal authority. As it became clearer that there was no solution agreeable to all parties, Slovenia and Croatia moved toward secession. Although tensions in Yugoslavia had been mounting since the early 1980s, it was 1990 that proved decisive. In the midst of economic hardship, Yugoslavia was facing rising nationalism among its various ethnic groups. By the early 1990s, there was no effective authority at the federal level. The Federal Presidency consisted of the representatives of the six republics, two provinces, and the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA). The communist leadership was divided along national lines.&lt;ref name="Prelude"/&gt;

[[File:Serbia_in_the_Yugoslav_Wars.png|thumb|Serbian-held territories of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Yugoslav wars. The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|War Crimes Tribunal]] accused [[Slobodan Milošević]] of "attempting to create a ''[[Greater Serbia]]''"', a [[Serbia]]n state encompassing the Serb-populated areas of Croatia and Bosnia, and achieved by [[Deportation|forcibly removing]] non-Serbs from large geographical areas through the commission of criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the ICTY Appeals Chamber; 18 April 2002; Reasons for the Decision on Prosecution Interlocutory Appeal from Refusal to Order Joinder; Paragraph 8&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The representatives of [[Vojvodina]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Montenegro]] were replaced with loyalists of the President of Serbia, [[Slobodan Milošević]]. Serbia secured four out of eight federal presidency votes&lt;ref name="Brown116"&gt;[[#Brown &amp; Karim|Brown &amp; Karim (1995)]], p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; and was able to heavily influence decision-making at the federal level, since all the other Yugoslav republics only had one vote. While Slovenia and Croatia wanted to allow a multi-party system, Serbia, led by Milošević, demanded an even more centralized federation and Serbia's dominant role in it.&lt;ref name="Prelude"&gt;[[#Bassiouni|Annex IV – Prelude to the breakup]]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[14th Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia|14th Extraordinary Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] in January 1990, the [[SR Serbia|Serbian]]-dominated assembly agreed to abolish the single-party system; however, Slobodan Milošević, the head of the Serbian Party branch ([[League of Communists of Serbia]]) used his influence to block and vote-down all other proposals from the [[SR Croatia|Croatian]] and [[SR Slovenia|Slovene]] party delegates. This prompted the Croatian and Slovene delegations to walk out and thus the break-up of the party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/europe/2000/milosevic_yugoslavia/communism.stm |title=Milosevic's Yugoslavia: Communism Crumbles |publisher=BBC News | work = Milosevic's Yugoslavia}}&lt;/ref&gt; a symbolic event representing the end of "[[brotherhood and unity]]".

Upon Croatia and Slovenia declaring independence in 1991, the Yugoslav federal government attempted to forcibly halt the impending breakup of the country, with Yugoslav Prime Minister [[Ante Marković]] declaring the secessions of Slovenia and Croatia to be illegal and contrary to the constitution of Yugoslavia, and declared support for the Yugoslav People's Army to secure the integral unity of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cohen-Dragović-Saso|Cohen &amp; Dragović-Saso (2008)]], p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stephen A. Hart, author of ''Partisans: War in the Balkans 1941–1945'', the ethnically mixed region of [[Dalmatia]] held close and amicable relations between the Croats and Serbs who lived there in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many early proponents of a united Yugoslavia came from this region, such as [[Ante Trumbić]], a Croat from Dalmatia. However, by the time of the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars, any hospitable relations between Croats and Serbs in Dalmatia had broken down, with Dalmatian Serbs fighting on the side of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]].

Even though the policies throughout the entire socialist period of Yugoslavia seemed to have been the same (namely that all Serbs should live in one state), Dejan Guzina argues that "different contexts in each of the subperiods of socialist Serbia and Yugoslavia yielded entirely different results (e.g., in favor of Yugoslavia, or in favor of a [[Greater Serbia]])". He assumes that the Serbian policy changed from conservative–socialist at the beginning to [[xenophobic]] nationalist in the late 1980s and 1990s.{{Sfn|Guzina|2003|p=91}}

===Ten-Day War (1991)===

{{Main|Ten-Day War}}
The first of the conflicts, known as the Ten-Day War, was initiated by the JNA (Yugoslav People's Army) on 26 June 1991 after the secession of Slovenia from the federation on 25 June 1991.&lt;ref name="Race"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dk.fdv.uni-lj.si/dela/Race-Helena.PDF|title="Dan prej" – 26. junij 1991: diplomsko delo|language=Slovenian|trans-title="A Day Before" – 26 June 1991 (diploma thesis)|first=Helena|last=Race|publisher=Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana|year=2005|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prunk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slovenija2001.gov.si/10years/path|title=Path to Slovene State|first=Janko |last=Prunk|year=2001|accessdate=3 February 2011|publisher=Public Relations and Media Office, Government of the Republic of Slovenia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the federal government ordered the Yugoslav People's Army to secure border crossings in Slovenia. Slovenian police and [[Slovenian Territorial Defence]] blockaded barracks and roads, leading to stand-offs and limited skirmishes around the republic. After several dozen casualties, the limited conflict was stopped through negotiation at [[Brijuni|Brioni]] on 7 July 1991, when Slovenia and Croatia agreed to a three-month moratorium on secession. The Federal army completely withdrew from Slovenia by 26 October 1991.

=== Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995) ===
{{Main|Croatian War of Independence}}

[[File:Sunja (Croatia).JPG|thumb|Destroyed [[Serbs in Croatia|Serbian]] house in [[Sunja, Sisak-Moslavina County|Sunja]], Croatia. Most Serbs fled during [[Operation Storm]] in 1995.]]
Fighting in Croatia had begun weeks prior to the Ten-Day War in Slovenia. The Croatian War of Independence began when [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs in Croatia]], who were opposed to [[Independence of Croatia|Croatian independence]], announced their secession from Croatia.

After the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|1990 parliamentary elections]] in Croatia, [[Franjo Tuđman]] came to power and became the first [[President of Croatia]]. He promoted nationalist policies and had a primary goal of the establishment of an independent Croatia. The new government proposed [[Constitution of Croatia|constitutional changes]], reinstated the traditional [[Flag of Croatia|Croatian flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Croatia|coat of arms]] and removed the term "Socialist" from the title of the republic.{{sfn|Tanner|2001|p=229}} In an attempt to counter changes made to the constitution, local Serb politicians organized a referendum on "Serb sovereignty and autonomy" in August 1990. Their boycott escalated into an insurrection in areas populated by ethnic Serbs, mostly around Knin, known as the [[Log Revolution]].{{sfn|Tanner|2001|p=233}} Local police in Knin sided with the growing Serbian insurgency, while many government employees, mostly in police where commanding positions were mainly held by Serbs and Communists, lost their jobs.{{sfn|Ramet|2010|p=262}} The new Croatian constitution was ratified in December 1990, when the Serb National Council proclaimed the [[SAO Krajina]].{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=222}}

Ethnic tensions rose, fueled by [[propaganda in the Yugoslav Wars|propaganda]] in both Croatia and Serbia. On 2 May 1991, one of the first armed clashes between Serb paramilitaries and Croatian police occurred in the [[Battle of Borovo Selo]].{{sfn|Ramet|2010|p=119}} On 19 May an [[Croatian independence referendum, 1991|independence referendum]] was held, which was largely boycotted by [[Croatian Serbs]], and the majority voted in favour of the independence of Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/20/world/croatia-votes-for-sovereignty-and-confederation.html?ref=croatia|title=Croatia Votes for Sovereignty and Confederation|first=Chuck|last=Sudetic|authorlink=Chuck Sudetic|date=20 May 1991|accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=222}} Croatia declared independence and dissolved its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. Due to the [[Brioni Agreement]], a three-month moratorium was placed on the implementation of the decision that ended on 8 October.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=226}}

The armed incidents of early 1991 escalated into an all-out war over the summer, with fronts formed around the areas of the breakaway SAO Krajina. The JNA had disarmed the Territorial Units of Slovenia and Croatia prior to the declaration of independence, at the behest of Serbian President Slobodan Milošević.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaurdić|first=Josip|title=The Hour of Europe: Western Powers and the Breakup of Yugoslavia|year=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-16645-3|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#BassiouniIII|Annex III – The Conflict in Slovenia]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was aggravated further by an arms embargo, imposed by the UN on Yugoslavia. The JNA was ostensibly ideologically unitarian, but its officer corps was predominantly staffed by Serbs or Montenegrins (70 percent).&lt;ref&gt;[[#BassiouniIII|Annex III – General structure of the Yugoslav armed forces]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the JNA opposed Croatian independence and sided with the Croatian Serb rebels. The Croatian Serb rebels were unaffected by the embargo as they had the support of and access to supplies of the JNA. By mid-July 1991, the JNA moved an estimated 70,000 troops to Croatia. The fighting rapidly escalated, eventually spanning hundreds of square kilometers from western Slavonia through [[Banija]] to Dalmatia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#BassiouniIII|Annex III – Forces operating in Croatia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Croatian War 1991 Vukovar destroyed tank.jpg|left|thumb|A JNA [[M-84|M-84 tank]] disabled by a mine laid by Croat soldiers in [[Vukovar]] in November 1991.]]

Border regions faced direct attacks from forces within Serbia and Montenegro. In August 1991, the [[Battle of Vukovar]] began, where fierce fighting took place with around 1,800 Croat fighters blocking JNA's advance into Slavonia. By the end of October, the town was almost completely devastated from land shelling and air bombardment.{{sfn|Tanner|2001|p=256}} The [[Siege of Dubrovnik]] started in October with the shelling of [[UNESCO]] [[world heritage site]] [[Dubrovnik]], where the international press was criticised for focusing on the city's architectural heritage, instead of reporting the destruction of Vukovar in which many civilians were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Joseph | last = Pearson | url = http://ehq.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/40/2/197 | title = Dubrovnik's Artistic Patrimony, and its Role in War Reporting (1991) | journal = European History Quarterly | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 197–216 | year = 2010 | doi=10.1177/0265691410358937}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 November 1991 the battle of Vukovar ended after the city ran out of ammunition. The [[Vukovar massacre|Ovčara massacre]] occurred shortly after Vukovar's capture by the JNA.{{sfn|Ramet|2010|p=263}} Meanwhile, control over central Croatia was seized by Croatian Serb forces in conjunction with the JNA Corps from Bosnia and Herzegovina, under the leadership of [[Ratko Mladić]].&lt;ref name=BBCProfile&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile: Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb army chief|work=BBC News|date=31 July 2012|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13559597|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1992, the [[Vance plan|Vance Plan]] proclaimed UN controlled (UNPA) zones for [[Serbs]] in territory claimed by Serbian rebels as the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) and brought an end to major military operations, though sporadic artillery attacks on Croatian cities and occasional intrusions of Croatian forces into UNPA zones continued until 1995. The fighting in Croatia ended in mid-1995, after [[Operation Flash]] and [[Operation Storm]]. At the end of these operations, Croatia had reclaimed all of its territory except the UNPA Sector East portion of Slavonia, bordering Serbia. Most of the Serb population in the reclaimed areas became refugees, and these operations led to war crimes trials by the ICTY against elements of the Croatian military leadership in the [[Trial of Gotovina et al]]. Generals [[Ante Gotovina]] and [[Mladen Markač]] were found guilty of "war crimes and crimes against humanity" in the first instance verdict,&lt;ref name="gotovina judgement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Judgement Summary for Gotovina et al.|location=The Hague|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/gotovina/tjug/en/110415_summary.pdf|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|date=15 April 2011|accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were acquitted on appeal in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/gotovina/acjug/en/121116_summary.pdf|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]|format=PDF|title=Appeals Judgement Summary for Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač|date=16 November 2012|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The areas of "Sector East", unaffected by the Croatian military operations, came under UN administration ([[UNTAES]]), and were reintegrated to Croatia in 1998 under the terms of the [[Erdut Agreement]].&lt;ref name="USIP-Erdut-Agreement"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[United States Institute of Peace]]|url=http://www.usip.org/files/file/resources/collections/peace_agreements/croatia_erdut_11121995.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Erdut Agreement|date=12 November 1995|accessdate=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnian War (1992–1995)===
{{Main|Bosnian War}}
[[File:Evstafiev-bosnia-sarajevo-water-line.jpg|thumb|left|People waiting in line to gather water during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], 1992]]
In 1992, conflict engulfed [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The war was predominantly a territorial conflict between the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] chiefly supported by [[Bosniaks]], the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb entity [[Republika Srpska]], and the self-proclaimed [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Herzeg-Bosnia]], who were led and supplied by Serbia and Croatia respectively, reportedly with a goal of the [[partition of Bosnia]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The Yugoslav armed forces had disintegrated into a largely Serb-dominated military force. Opposed to the Bosnian-majority led government's agenda for independence, and along with other armed nationalist Serb militant forces, the JNA attempted to prevent Bosnian citizens from voting in the 1992 referendum on independence.&lt;ref name="Meštrović 1996 p. 36"&gt;[[#Meštrović|Meštrović (1996)]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; This did not succeed in persuading people not to vote and instead the intimidating atmosphere combined with a Serb boycott of the vote resulted in a resounding 99% vote in support for independence.&lt;ref name="Meštrović 1996 p. 36"/&gt;

[[File:Evstafiev-bosnia-sarajevo-woman-cries-at-grave.jpg|thumb|right|A Serb woman mourns at a grave at the Lion's cemetery in [[Sarajevo]], 1992]]

On 19 June 1992, the war in Bosnia broke out, though the [[Siege of Sarajevo]] had already begun in April after Bosnia and Herzegovina had declared independence. The conflict, typified by the years-long Sarajevo siege and [[Srebrenica massacre|Srebrenica]], was by far the bloodiest and most widely covered of the Yugoslav wars. Bosnia's Serb faction led by ultra-nationalist [[Radovan Karadžić]] promised independence for all Serb areas of Bosnia from the majority-Bosniak government of Bosnia. To link the disjointed parts of territories populated by Serbs and areas claimed by Serbs, Karadžić pursued an agenda of systematic ethnic cleansing primarily against Bosnians through massacre and forced removal of Bosniak populations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meštrović|Meštrović (1996)]], pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1992, tensions between [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Croats]] and Bosniaks rose and their collaboration fell apart. In January 1993, the two former allies engaged in open conflict, resulting in the [[Croat–Bosniak War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref={{harvid|Delic judgement|2008}}|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/delic/tjug/en/080915.pdf|title=Prosecutor v.

After the successful Flash and Storm operations, the Croatian Army and the combined Bosnian and Croat forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, conducted an operation codenamed [[Operation Mistral 2|Operation Mistral]] to push back Bosnian Serb military gains.{{sfn|CIA|2002|p=379}}

Together with [[1995 NATO bombing in Bosnia and Herzegovina|NATO air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs]], the successes on the ground put pressure on the Serbs to come to the negotiating table. Pressure was put on all sides to stick to the cease-fire and [[Peace plans offered before and during the Bosnian War|negotiate an end]] to the war in Bosnia. The war ended with the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] on 14 December 1995, with the formation of [[Republika Srpska]] as an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina being the resolution for Bosnian Serb demands.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in the United States reported in April 1995 that 90 percent of all the atrocities in the Yugoslav wars up to that point had been committed by Serb militants.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meštrović|Meštrović (1996)]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these atrocities occurred in Bosnia. In 2004, the ICTY ruled that the Srebrenica massacre constituted genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf |title=ICTY "Prosecutor v.

On 22 November 2017, [[Ratko Mladić]], former Chief of Staff of the Army of the Republika Srpska, was sentenced to life in prison by ICTY for 10 charges, one of genocide, five of crimes against humanity and four of violations of the laws or customs of war.

&lt;section begin=KosoovoWar /&gt;After September 1990 when the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] had been unilaterally repealed by the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]], Kosovo's autonomy suffered and so the region was faced with state organized oppression: from the early 1990s, Albanian language radio and television were restricted and newspapers shut down. Kosovar Albanians were fired in large numbers from public enterprises and institutions, including banks, hospitals, the post office and schools.&lt;ref name=milutnovic88 /&gt; In June 1991 the [[University of Priština]] assembly and several faculty councils were dissolved and replaced by Serbs. Kosovar Albanian teachers were prevented from entering school premises for the new school year beginning in September 1991, forcing students to study at home.&lt;ref name=milutnovic88&gt;[[#Milutinovic et al.|''The Prosecutor vs Milan Milutinović et al. – Judgement'', 26 February 2009]], pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Kosovar Albanians started an insurgency against Belgrade when the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] was founded in 1996. Armed clashes between the two sides broke out in early 1998. A [[NATO]]-facilitated ceasefire was signed on 15 October, but both sides broke it two months later and fighting resumed. When the killing of 45 Kosovar Albanians in the [[Račak massacre]] was reported in January 1999, NATO decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force to forcibly restrain the two sides. After the Rambouillet Accords broke down on 23 March with Yugoslav rejection of an external peacekeeping force, NATO prepared to install the peacekeepers by force.&lt;section end=KosoovoWar /&gt; The [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] followed, an intervention against Serbian forces with a mainly bombing campaign, under the command of [[Wesley Clark|General Wesley Clark]]. Hostilities ended 2½ months later with the [[Kumanovo Agreement]]. Kosovo was placed under the governmental control of the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] and the military protection of [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR). The 15-month war had left thousands of civilians killed on both sides and over a million displaced.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Milutinovic et al.|''The Prosecutor vs Milan Milutinović et al. – Judgement'', 26 February 2009]], p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely considered that [[mass murders]] against Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina escalated into genocide. On 18 December 1992, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] issued resolution 47/121 condemning "aggressive acts by the Serbian and Montenegrin forces to acquire more territories by force" and called such ethnic cleansing "a form of [[genocide]]".&lt;ref name="Resolution"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r121.htm|title=Resolution 47/121, 91st plenary meeting, The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=18 December 1992|publisher=[[United Nations General Assembly]]|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its report published on the 1 January 1993, [[Helsinki Watch]] was one of the first [[Civil rights organization|civil rights organisations]] that warned that "the extent of the violence and its selective nature along ethnic and religious lines suggest crimes of genocidal character against Muslim and, to a lesser extent, Croatian populations in Bosnia-Hercegovina".&lt;ref name="Helsinki Watch Report"&gt;{{cite web| title=Human Rights Watch World Report 1993 - The former Yugoslav Republics |date=1 January 1993| url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/467fca72a.html | publisher=Helsinki Watch| accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trial took place before the [[International Court of Justice]], following a [[Bosnian Genocide Case|1993 suit]] by Bosnia and Herzegovina against Serbia and Montenegro alleging [[genocide]]. The ICJ ruling of 26 February 2007 indirectly determined the war's nature to be international, though clearing Serbia of direct responsibility for the genocide committed by the forces of [[History of Republika Srpska#1991–1995|Republika Srpska]]. The ICJ concluded, however, that Serbia failed to prevent genocide committed by Serb forces and failed to punish those responsible, and bring them to justice.&lt;ref name="Court Declares Bosnia Killings Were Genocide"/&gt; A telegram sent to the White House on 8 February 1994 and penned by U.S. Ambassador to Croatia, [[Peter W. Galbraith]], stated that genocide was occurring. The telegram cited "constant and indiscriminate shelling and gunfire" of Sarajevo by Karadzic's Yugoslav People Army; the harassment of minority groups in Northern Bosnia "in an attempt to force them to leave"; and the use of detainees "to do dangerous work on the front lines" as evidence that genocide was being committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/IMG/20091106-friday.pdf|title=Galbraith telegram|author=Peter W. Galbraith|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[United States Congress]] passed a resolution declaring that "the Serbian policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing meet the terms defining genocide".&lt;ref name="thomas.loc.gov"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:s.res.00134: A resolution expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995], thomas.loc.gov; accessed 25 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the evidence of many kinds of war crimes conducted simultaneously by different Serb forces in different parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially in [[Bijeljina massacre|Bijeljina]], [[Siege of Sarajevo|Sarajevo]], [[Prijedor massacre|Prijedor]], [[Zvornik massacre|Zvornik]], [[Banja Luka]], [[Višegrad massacres|Višegrad]] and [[Foča massacre|Foča]], the judges ruled that the criteria for genocide with the specific intent (''[[dolus specialis]]'') to destroy Bosnian Muslims were met [[Srebrenica massacre|only in Srebrenica]] or Eastern Bosnia in 1995.&lt;ref name="Court Declares Bosnia Killings Were Genocide"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Marlise Simons]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/world/europe/27hague.html | title=Court Declares Bosnia Killings Were Genocide| work=The New York Times| date=27 February 2007| accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court concluded that other crimes, outside Srebrenica, committed during the 1992–1995 war, may amount to [[crimes against humanity]] according to the international law, but that these acts did not, in themselves, constitute genocide per se.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/international_court_of_justice/serbia-found-guilty-of-failure-to-prevent-and-punish-genocide.47.html?cat_id=2&amp;news_id=10130 |title=Sense Tribunal: SERBIA FOUND GUILTY OF FAILURE TO PREVENT AND PUNISH GENOCIDE |accessdate=25 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730091312/http://www.sense-agency.com/en/stream.php?sta=3&amp;pid=9273&amp;kat=3 |archivedate=30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crime of genocide in the Srebrenica enclave was confirmed in several guilty verdicts handed down by the ICTY, most notably in the conviction of the Bosnian Serb leader [[Radovan Karadžić]].&lt;ref name="Radovan Karadzic guilty of genocide over Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/radovan-karadzic-guilty-of-genocide-over-srebrenica-massacre-in-bosnia-a6950251.html | title=Radovan Karadzic guilty of genocide over Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia| author=Alexandra Sims | work=The Independent| date=24 March 2016| accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnic cleansing ===
{{Main|Ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian War}}
[[Ethnic cleansing]] was a common phenomenon in the wars in Croatia, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This entailed intimidation, [[forced expulsion]], or [[Murder|killing]] of the unwanted ethnic group as well as the destruction of the places of worship, cemeteries and cultural and historical buildings of that ethnic group in order to alter the population composition of an area in the favour of another ethnic group which would become the majority. These examples of [[territorial nationalism]] and [[Irredentism|territorial aspirations]] are part of the goal of an [[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-state]].{{Sfn|Wood|2001|p=57–75}}

According to the ICTY, Serb forces deported at least 80–100,000 Croats in Croatia in 1991–92&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/stanisic_simatovic/tjug/en/130530_summary.pdf | title=Judgement Summary for Jovica Stanišić and Franko Simatović | date=30 May 2013| publisher=ICTY |page=2| accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least 700,000 Albanians in Kosovo in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.icty.org/en/press/five-senior-serb-officials-convicted-kosovo-crimes-one-acquitted | title=Five Senior Serb Officials Convicted of Kosovo Crimes, One Acquitted | date=26 February 2009| publisher=ICTY | accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further hundreds of thousands of Muslims were forced out of their homes by the Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{Sfn|Campbell|2001|p=58}} By one estimate, the Serb forces drove at least 700,000 Bosnian Muslims from the area of Bosnia under their control.{{Sfn|Geldenhuys|2004|p=34}}

===War rape===
[[File:Trnopolje Camp.jpg|thumb|Detainees at the [[Trnopolje camp]], near [[Prijedor]] (photograph provided courtesy of the [[ICTY]])]]
{{Main|Rape in the Bosnian War}}
[[War rape]] occurred as a matter of official orders as part of [[ethnic cleansing]], to displace the targeted ethnic group.&lt;ref name="de Brouwer 2005 10"&gt;[[#de Brouwer|de Brouwer (2005)]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Tresnjevka Women's Group, more than 35,000 women and children were held in such Serb-run "rape camps".&lt;ref name=debrouwer9&gt;[[#de Brouwer|de Brouwer (2005)]], pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.newint.org/issue244/rape.htm | work = New Internationalist | issue = 244 | date = June 1993 | title = Rape: Weapon of War | first = Angela | last = Robson | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100817134853/http://www.newint.org/issue244/rape.htm | archivedate = 2010-08-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://srebrenica.brightside.nl/srebrenica/ Netherlands Institute for War Documentation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929214505/http://srebrenica.brightside.nl/srebrenica/ |date=September 29, 2007 }} Part 1 Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dragoljub Kunarac]], [[Radomir Kovač]], and [[Zoran Vuković]] were convicted of [[crimes against humanity]] for rape, torture, and enslavement committed during the [[Foča massacres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2001/02/22/bosnia-landmark-verdicts-rape-torture-and-sexual-enslavement | work = Human Rights Watch | title = Bosnia: Landmark Verdicts for Rape, Torture, and Sexual Enslavement - Criminal Tribunal Convicts Bosnian Serbs for Crimes Against Humanity | publisher = Human Rights Watch  | date = 22 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence of the magnitude of rape in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] prompted the ICTY to deal openly with these abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/specials/bosnia/context/0628warcrimes-tribunal.html|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=For first time, Court Defines Rape as War Crime|work=The New York Times|date=June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of sexual violence during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992–1995) and [[Kosovo War]] (1998–1999) perpetrated by the Serbian regular and irregular forces have been described as "especially alarming".&lt;ref name=debrouwer9/&gt; The NATO-led Kosovo Force documented rapes of Albanian, Roma and Serbian women by both Serbs and members of the Kosovo Liberation Army.&lt;ref&gt;[[#de Brouwer|de Brouwer (2005)]], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have estimated that during the Bosnian War between 20,000 and 50,000 women, mainly Bosniak, were raped.{{Sfn|Salzman|1998|p=348–378}}&lt;ref name=independent2006&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/film-award-forces-serbs-to-face-spectre-of-bosnias-rape-babies-526028.html |title=Film award forces Serbs to face spectre of Bosnia's rape babies |date=20 February 2006 | author = Vesna Peric Zimonjic | newspaper=The Independent |location= Belgrade |accessdate=26 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924011648/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/film-award-forces-serbs-to-face-spectre-of-bosnias-rape-babies-526028.html |archivedate=September 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are few reports of rape and sexual assault between members of the same ethnic group.&lt;ref name="Bassiouni"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.earlham.edu/~pols/ps17971/terneel/bassiouni.html | dead-url=yes | title = United Nations Commission on Breaches of Geneva Law in Former Yugoslavia | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090808030659/http://www.earlham.edu/~pols/ps17971/terneel/bassiouni.html |archive-date=8 August 2009 | date = 1997 | work = The International Fight Against Gender Inequality | access-date = 14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

War rape in the Yugoslav Wars has often been characterized as a [[crime against humanity]]. Rape perpetrated by Serb forces served to destroy cultural and social ties of the victims and their communities.{{Sfn|Card|1996|p=5–18}} Serbian policies allegedly urged soldiers to rape Bosniak women until they became pregnant as an attempt towards ethnic cleansing. Serbian soldiers hoped to force Bosniak women to carry Serbian children through repeated rape.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Allen|Allen (1996)]], p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Often Bosniak women were held in captivity for an extended period of time and only released slightly before the birth of a child conceived of rape. The systematic rape of Bosniak women may have carried further-reaching repercussions than the initial displacement of rape victims. Stress, caused by the trauma of rape, coupled with the lack of access to reproductive health care often experienced by displaced peoples, lead to serious health risks for victimized women.{{Sfn|McGinn|2000|p=174–180}}

During the Kosovo War thousands of Kosovo Albanian women and girls became victims of sexual violence. War rape was used as a weapon of war and an instrument of systematic [[ethnic cleansing]]; rape was used to terrorize the civilian population, extort money from families, and force people to flee their homes. According to a report by the [[Human Rights Watch]] group in 2000, rape in the Kosovo War can generally be subdivided into three categories: rapes in women's homes, rapes during flight, and rapes in detention.&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2000/03/20/serb-gang-rapes-kosovo-exposed|title=Serb Gang-Rapes in Kosovo Exposed | date = March 20, 2000 | work=Human Rights Watch| publisher = Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW2"&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2000/fry/index.htm | title = Kosovo: Rape as a Weapon of "Ethnic Cleansing" | publisher = Human Rights Watch | access-date = 14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the perpetrators were Serbian paramilitaries, but also included Serbian special police or Yugoslav army soldiers. Virtually all of the sexual assaults Human Rights Watch documented were gang rapes involving at least two perpetrators.&lt;ref name="HRW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW2"/&gt; Since the end of the war, rapes of Serbian, Albanian, and Roma women by ethnic Albanians — sometimes by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) – have been documented.&lt;ref name="HRW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW2"/&gt; Rapes occurred frequently in the presence, and with the acquiescence, of military officers. Soldiers, police, and paramilitaries often raped their victims in the full view of numerous witnesses.&lt;ref name="de Brouwer 2005 10"/&gt;

== Consequences ==
===Casualties===
[[File:Exhumation Site in Čančari valley.jpg|thumb|Exhumation of the Srebrenica massacre victims]]
Some estimates put the number of killed in the Yugoslav Wars at 140,000.&lt;ref name=ictj/&gt; The [[Humanitarian Law Center]] estimates that in the conflicts in former Yugoslav republics at least 130,000 people lost their lives.&lt;ref name=HLC/&gt; Slovenia's involvement in the conflicts was brief, thus avoiding higher casualties, and around 70 people were killed in its ten-day conflict. The War in Croatia left an estimated 20,000 people dead. Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered the heaviest burden of the fighting: around 100,000 people were killed in the war. In the Kosovo conflict, around 13,500 were killed. Overall, no less than 133,000 people were killed in the post-Yugoslav conflicts in the 90s.{{Sfn|Egan|p=171}} The highest death toll was in [[Sarajevo]]: with around 14,000 killed during the siege,{{Sfn|Egan|p=171}} the city lost almost as many people as the entire war in Kosovo.

In relative and absolute numbers, [[Bosniaks]] suffered the heaviest losses: 64,036 of their people were killed, which represents a death toll of over 3% of their entire ethnic group.{{Sfn|Toal|Dahlman|2011|p=136–137}} They experienced the worst plight in the Srebrenica massacre, where the [[mortality rate]] of the Bosniak men (irrespective of their age or civilian status) reached 33% in July 1995.{{Sfn|Brunborg|Lyngstad|Urdal|2003|p=229–248}} 
The share of Bosniaks among all the civilian fatalities during the Bosnian War was around 83%, rising to almost 95% in Eastern Bosnia.{{Sfn|Smajić|2013|p=124}}

During the War in Croatia, 43.4% of the killed on the Croatian side were civilians.{{sfn|Fink|2010|p=469}}

===Internally displaced and refugees===
It is estimated that the wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo produced about 2.4 million [[refugees]] and an additional 2 million [[internally displaced]] persons.{{Sfn|Watkins|2003|p=10}}

The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina caused 2.2 million refugees or displaced, of which over half were Bosniaks.{{Sfn|UNHCR|2003}} Up until 2001, there were still 650,000 displaced Bosniaks, while 200,000 left the country permanently.{{Sfn|UNHCR|2003}}
{{Triple image|right|Evstafiev-bosnia-travnik-girl-doll-refugee.jpg|150|Eksodi 99 Kukes.JPG|150|Kosovo-metohija-koreni-duse004.jpg|138| Bosnian refugees in 1993 | Kosovo Albanian refugees in 1999 | Kosovo Serb refugees in 1999}}
The Kosovo War caused 862,979 Albanian refugees who were either expelled from the Serb forces or fled from the battle front.{{Sfn|Human Rights Watch|2001}} In addition, several hundreds of thousands were [[internally displaced]], which means that, according to the [[OSCE]], almost 90% of all Albanians were displaced from their homes in Kosovo by June 1999.{{Sfn|OSCE|1999|p=13}} After the end of the war, Albanians returned, but over 200,000 Serbs, Romani and other non-Albanians fled Kosovo. By the end of 2000, Serbia thus became the host of 700,000 Serb refugees or internally displaced from Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia.&lt;ref name="Bleak outlook for Serb refugees"/&gt;

From the perspective of [[Right of asylum|asylum]] for internally displaced or refugees, Croatia took the brunt of the crisis. According to some sources, in 1992 Croatia was the host to almost 750,000 refugees or internally displaced, which represents a quota of almost 16% of its population of 4.7 million inhabitants: these figures included 420 to 450,000 Bosnian refugees, 35,000 refugees from Serbia (mostly from Vojvodina and Kosovo) while a further 265,000 persons from other parts of Croatia itself were internally displaced. This would be equivalent of Germany being a host to 10 million displaced people or France to 8 million people. {{Sfn|Council of Europe|1993|p=9}} Official [[UNHCR]] data indicate that Croatia was the host to 287,000 refugees and 344,000 internally displaced in 1993. This is a ratio of 64.7 refugees per 1000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNHCRHR|UNHCR 2002]], p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1992 report, UNHCR placed Croatia #7 on its list of 50 most refugee burdened countries: it registered 316 thousand refugees, which is a ratio of 15:1 relative to its total population.{{Sfn|UNHCR|1993|p=11}} Together with those internally displaced, Croatia was the host to at least 648,000 people in need of an accommodation in 1992.{{Sfn|UNHCR|1993|p=8}} In comparison, [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] had 10.5 refugees per 1000 inhabitants in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNHCRMK|UNHCR 2000]], p 319&lt;/ref&gt; Slovenia was the host to 45,000 refugees in 1993, which is 22.7 refugees per 1000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNHCRSL|UNHCR 2002]], p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serbia and Montenegro]] were the host to 479,111 refugees in 1993, which is a ratio of 45.5 refugees per 1000 inhabitants. By 1998 this grew to 502,037 refugees (or 47.7 refugees per 1000 inhabitants). By 2000 the number of refugees fell to 484,391 persons, but the number of internally displaced grew to 267,500, or a combined total of 751,891 persons who were displaced and in need of an accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNHCRSR|UNHCR 2002]], p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Material damage===
[[File:Siege-Shattered Facade - Sarajevo - Bosnia and Herzegovina.jpg|thumb|War damage on the Sarajevo buildings]]
Material and economic damages brought by the conflicts were catastrophic. Bosnia and Herzegovina had a [[GDP]] of between $8&amp;ndash;9 billion before the war. The government estimated the overall war damages at $50&amp;ndash;$70 billion. It also registered a GDP decline of 75% after the war.{{Sfn|World Bank|1996|p=10}} Some 60% of the [[housing]] in the country has been either damaged or destroyed, which proved a problem when trying to bring all the refugees back home.{{Sfn|Meyers|2004|p=136}} Bosnia also became the most [[landmine]] contaminated country of Europe: 1820&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of its territory were contaminated with these explosives, which represent 3.6% of its land surface. Between 3 and 6 million landmines were scattered throughout Bosnia. 5,000 people died from them, of which 1,520 after the war.{{Sfn|Jha|2014|p=68}}

In 1999, the [[Croatian Parliament]] passed a bill estimating war damages of the country at $37 billion.{{Sfn|Bicanic|2008|p=158–173}} The government alleges that between 1991 and April 1993 an estimated total of 210,000 buildings in Croatia (including schools, [[hospital]]s and [[refugee camps]]) were either damaged or destroyed from shelling by the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] and the JNA forces. Cities affected by the shelling were [[Karlovac]], [[Gospić]], [[Ogulin]], [[Zadar]], [[Biograd]] and others.{{Sfn|OHCHR|1993|p=23}} The Croatian government also acknowledged that 7,489 buildings belonging to Croatian Serbs were damaged or destroyed by explosives, arson or other deliberate means  by the end of 1992.

{{main|International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals}}

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was a body of the [[U.N.]] established to prosecute serious crimes committed during the Yugoslav Wars, and to try their perpetrators. The tribunal was an [[ad hoc]] court located in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. One of the most prominent [[Trial of Slobodan Milošević|trials involved ex-Serbian President Slobodan Milošević]], who was in 2002 indicted on 66 counts of [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]] and [[genocide]] allegedly committed in wars in Kosovo, Bosnia and Croatia.{{sfn|Magliveras|2002|p=661–677}} His trial remained incomplete since he died in 2006, before a verdict was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN tribunal investigating death of accused genocide mastermind Slobodan Milosevic |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2006/03/171822-un-tribunal-investigating-death-accused-genocide-mastermind-slobodan-milosevic| date=12 March 2006|publisher=UN News |accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, ICTY's trial "helped to delegitimize Milosevic's leadership", as one scholar put it.{{sfn|Akhavan|2001|p=7–31}}

Several convictions were handed over by the ICTY and its successor, the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals (MICT).
