'''Afro-Kittians''' and '''Afro-Nevisians''' are [[Demographics of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Saint Kitts and Nevis people]] whose ancestry lies within the continent of [[Africa]], most notably [[West Africa]].

As of 2013, black people are the predominant ethnic group in Saint Kitts and Nevis.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sc.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook -- Saint Kitts and Nevis |accessdate=2013-06-20 |publisher=CIA | archiveurl= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sc.html| archivedate= 10 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The initial arrival of Africans in St. Kitts and Nevis was in the late 17th century as a result of the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=16|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  St Kitts, the largest of the two islands, has geography well suited for sugar plantations, but was plagued by colonial warfare in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheridan|first1=Richard B.|title=Sugar and slavery : an economic history of the British West Indies, 1623 - 1775|date=1994|publisher=Canoe Press|location=Kingston|isbn=9768125136|pages=149|edition=2. impr., reprint, originally publ. 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevis, which has similar geography and was relatively sheltered, became an early center of the slave trade in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheridan|first1=Richard B.|title=Sugar and slavery : an economic history of the British West Indies, 1623 - 1775|date=1994|publisher=Canoe Press|location=Kingston|isbn=9768125136|pages=161|edition=2. impr., reprint, originally publ. 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first census of Nevis, conducted in 1671, recorded 1,739 African slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheridan|first1=Richard B.|title=Sugar and slavery : an economic history of the British West Indies, 1623 - 1775|date=1994|publisher=Canoe Press|location=Kingston|isbn=9768125136|pages=161|edition=2. impr., reprint, originally publ. 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later this number grew to 3,849, consisting of 1,422 men, 1,321 women, and 1,106 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheridan|first1=Richard B.|title=Sugar and slavery : an economic history of the British West Indies, 1623 - 1775|date=1994|publisher=Canoe Press|location=Kingston|isbn=9768125136|pages=161|edition=2. impr., reprint, originally publ. 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, a census in St. Kitts recorded 1,436 African slaves one year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheridan|first1=Richard B.|title=Sugar and slavery : an economic history of the British West Indies, 1623 - 1775|date=1994|publisher=Canoe Press|location=Kingston|isbn=9768125136|pages=149|edition=2. impr., reprint, originally publ. 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attracted by the stability of Nevis, the Royal African Company headquartered their West Indian slave trade in the port city of Charlestown: from 1674 to 1688 more than 6000 slaves were sold at auction here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheridan|first1=Richard B.|title=Sugar and slavery : an economic history of the British West Indies, 1623 - 1775|date=1994|publisher=Canoe Press|location=Kingston|isbn=9768125136|pages=161|edition=2. impr., reprint, originally publ. 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the plantation system on St. Kitts and Nevis, slaves were forced to clear the forests in preparation for sugar production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=62|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty of this work, combined with poor rations, resulted in a slave death rate “that was incredibly high on the two islands during the later part of 17th century”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=62|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the clearing work neared completion, planters tried to combat the high death rate by initiating a one-year “seasoning period” in which newly arrived slaves were supervised by older, trustworthy slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=67|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 18th century over 65% percent of the islands’ slave populations were native born and slave importation had decreased to fewer than 100 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=67|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little recorded information about the family structures of slaves on St. Kitts and Nevis, but slave “marriages” appear to have been encouraged as they were sometimes recorded by planters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=68|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children might grow up partially in a nuclear family situation, but were socialized as a group. Oral traditions, such as the Anansi spider from West Africa, were passed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=68|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the age of 4 or 5 children were first put to work, generally in groups called a “hogmeat gang”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=67|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these “gangs” 5 or 6 children were supervised by a slave woman while they did lighter work such as weeding and feeding animals. At night, children would eat small meals, often prepared by their mothers, consisting mostly of imported grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=67|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December the slave population had slightly more freedom and were often given extra beef and pork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=69|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The white population on the islands however organized guards to monitor the activities of slaves during their time off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=69|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the white population was wary of slaves revolting.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=69|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1639 the French had to dispatch 500 men to put down an uprising on St. Kitts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=69|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; African slaves resisted bondage in other ways, such as taking food from their masters to supplement their meager rations, and meeting to elect their own officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=70|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of emancipation approximately 11% of the population on the islands were freed colored people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Skilled slaves could buy their freedom by earning wages for their crafts, such as carpentry and masonry, on their day off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=71|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom could also be gained legislatively and through wills.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=71|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with slave mothers and white fathers enjoyed relative freedom of movement, but were still barred from owning land and thus participating in government.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=73|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Communities of freed people developed, with inhabitants mostly working trades but in some cases earning a living as merchants.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=73|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1770s onwards, freed people would often migrate to Trinidad or Demerara to earn higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=73|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emancipation to 1900 ===
In 1833 the British Empire outlawed slavery, but full legal freedom didn’t come to St. Kitts and Nevis until 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horsford|first1=Simon|title=St Kitts: back to my island roots|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/caribbean/saint-kitts-and-nevis/articles/St-Kitts-back-to-my-island-roots/|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the government of St. Kitts and Nevis set up a form of modified slavery called apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=16|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this system, former slave holders continued to own all farmable land and slaves had to buy their freedom by working 45 hours a week for a period of 4 to 6 years. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since Saturdays were market day, when slaves had traditionally sold wares for income, having to work 6 days a week was a large hindrance for apprentices attempting to purchase their freedom. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Slaves heard that the island of Antigua had granted full freedom to  slaves and recognized the change to the apprenticeship system was simply bondage under another name.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, some absentee slave owners on St. Kitts freed all, or most, of their slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=17|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus the transition from apprenticeship to slavery was met with resistance, both “quiet and disquiet”. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the day the apprenticeship program was set to begin, August 2, 1834, few apprentices on St.Kitts showed up to their positions.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Those that did tended to hold more skilled positions, reflecting the stratification among slaves themselves.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The resistance was high enough that the governor of The Leeward Islands, Evan Murray Macgregor, announced that if apprentices didn’t return by the 6th, martial law would go into effect.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Meanwhile, many of the apprentices were leaving their homes and fleeing to the hills. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Planters attempted to quell the revolt by identifying leaders and punishing them with jail time or lashes, but 2 weeks after the apprenticeship program was supposed to start, the majority of workers remained in the mountains.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While August was the down season for farming, slave owners were still worried about their unattended livestock.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To combat the revolt, planters burned the homes and possessions of absent apprentices.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, militia were sent into the mountains to drive resistance members from their temporary homes.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The combination of these two actions brought most of the former slaves out of the mountains and martial law was lifted on August 18.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There were no recorded deaths or injuries from the revolt, although some of the resistance received jail time, lashes, or were exiled.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The remaining 3 and a half years of the apprenticeship continued relatively peacefully. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Richard|title=Emancipation and Revolt in the West Indies: St. Kitts, 1834|journal=Science &amp; Society|date=1975|volume=39|issue=2|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After emancipation, differences began to develop between life on St. Kitts and on Nevis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=99|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Planters on Nevis, which is smaller and has less fertile land, had trouble offering competitive wages to their workers.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=100|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
To combat this, they allowed labourers to share in the profits of the sugarcane they grew.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=100|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While white planters continued to own land, on Nevis black field labourers had greater ties to it.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=100|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They thus had greater control over what could be planted.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=100|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Subsequently, black peasant farmers on Nevis were able to grow more sustenance crops than their counterparts on Nevis.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=99|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not legally barred from owning land, most blacks were practically barred from owning land through suppressive economic practices.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=102|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Their survival thus continued to rely a great deal on the whims of the white land owning class.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=102|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If blacks did manage to earn extra income, they would not find any banks on either of the two islands.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=102|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Workers would either hide coins in their homes or purchase livestock as an investment.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean migrants : environment and human survival on St. Kitts and Nevis .|date=1983|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=0-87049-360-4|pages=102|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the last two decades of the 19th century, sugar prices fell after German beet sugar hit English markets.

== Demography ==
Currently, 92% of the population is African-Caribbean: So, 80% of the archipelago's population is Afro-Kittians and Afro-Nevisians (75% black and 5.3% mulatto, partially of Irish origin) and 12% are [[Afro-European]]s (European pf African descent). Only 8% of the population is from other origins (5% of people is of Indian origin and Afro-Indian and 3.3% from other parts of South Asia). The whites are 1% (of British, French, Portuguese and Lebanese descent).&lt;ref name=WorldStatesMenDemographics&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint Kitts and Nevis|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis.html|year=2000|author=Ben Cahoon|publisher=[[WorldStatesmen]]|accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2474">The '''Amba''' (pl. '''Baamba''' and known by various other names) are a people located in border area of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Uganda]] south of [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] in the northern foothills of the [[Rwenzori Mountains]].  On the Uganda side, they are found in [[Bundibugyo District]].  On the Congolese side, they are located in the [[Watalinga]] and [[Bawisa]] subcounties of [[Beni, Nord-Kivu|Beni]], [[South Kivu]].  Numbering 35,600 on the Uganda side in the 2002 census and 4,500 on the Congolese side according to a 1991 [[SIL International]] estimate, [[Ethnologue]] lists their total population as 40,100.  Agriculturalists, the Amba traditionally cultivate [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, [[millet]], [[maize]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[peanut]]s, [[rice]], [[coffee]], [[cotton]], and [[cassava]], while raising [[goat]]s and [[sheep]].  The Amba practice [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=ethnologue&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rwm "Amba: A language of Uganda"], [[Ethnologue]] (accessed 20 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amba language (Uganda)|Amba language]] spoken by the Amba is called, variously, '''Kwamba''' by the Amba themselves and is known as '''Kihumu''' in the DR Congo.  There are many others.  It has a 70% lexical similarity with [[Bera language|Bera]]. Dialects include Kyanzi (Kihyanzi) and Suwa (Kusuwa).&lt;ref name=ethnologue/&gt;

The Amba were part of the armed [[Rwenzururu]] movement against the [[Toro Kingdom]] and central government that reached heights in the mid-1960s and early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prunier|first=Gérard|authorlink=Gérard Prunier|year=2009|title=Africa's World War: Congo, the Rwandan Genocide, and the Making of a Continental Catastrophe|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[Oxford]]|isbn=978-0-19-537420-9}}, 82-83&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the government recognized the [[Kingdom of Rwenzururu]], formed by the Amba and [[Konjo people]]s, as Uganda's first kingdom shared by two tribes.&lt;ref name=welcome&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200804010029.html "Uganda: Welcome Rwenzururu"], editorial by the ''[[New Vision]]'', 31 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Azerbaijani nationalism''' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: Azərbaycan milliyətçiliyi), also referred to as '''Azerbaijanism''' (Azərbaycançılıq), started out as a cultural movement among Azerbaijani intellectuals within the [[Russian Empire]] during the second half of the 19th century. While initially cultural in nature, it was later developed further into a political ideology which culminated in the establishment of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Najafov, Etibar: [http://biweekly.ada.edu.az/vol_1_no_12/The_evolution_of_Azerbaijani_nationalism.htm ''The evolution of Azerbaijani nationalism: Enlightenment, ADR, and Azerbaijanism''], Azerbaijan in the world. ADA Biweekly Newsletter, vol. 1, no. 12, July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to [[Armenian nationalism|Armenian]] and [[Georgian nationalism]], a specifically [[ethnic nationalism]] was rather slow to develop among Azerbaijanis, partly due to their self-identification as part of the larger Muslim world rather than as a singular ethnocultural nation.&lt;ref&gt;The Forsaken People: Case Studies of the Internally Displaced - Page 257 by Roberta Cohen, Francis Mading Deng&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] and its declaration of independence in 1991, however, [[Azerbaijan]] has witnessed the ascent of a particularly strong Azerbaijani nationalism, including various types of [[Pan-nationalism]] and [[irredentism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirose, Yoko: ''The Complexity of Nationalism in Azerbaijan'', International Journal of Social Science Studies, vol. 4, no. 5, p. 136-149, May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Territory==
Irredentist claims by Azerbaijani nationalists would mainly seek to incorporate large sections of [[Iran]] as well as parts of [[Armenia]], [[Russia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Turkey]] within a proposed enlarged territory known as ''[[Whole Azerbaijan]]''. Iran hosts a larger number of ethnic Azerbaijanis than the independent nation of Azerbaijan, and prior to the establishment of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] in 1918 the name of "Azerbaijan" was exclusively used to identify the [[Iranian Azerbaijan|adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran]].&lt;ref name="I.B.Tauris"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atabaki|first1=Touraj|title=Azerbaijan: Ethnicity and the Struggle for Power in Iran|date=2000|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781860645549|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="I.B.

Azerbaijani consciousness is also central to wider cooperation with ethnically affiliated populations through [[Pan-Turkism]]. &lt;ref name="fishman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Language and Ethnic Identity: The Success-Failure Continuum in Language and Ethnic Identity Efforts|last=Fishman|first=Joshua |authorlink=|author2=Garcia, Ofelia|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=2|location=|isbn=978-0-19-539245-6|page=269|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUydX_3rG0AC&amp;pg=PA269|quote=''It is commonly acknowledged that pan-Turkism, the movement aiming at the political and/or cultural unification of all Turkic peoples, emerged among Turkic intellectuals of Russia as a liberal-cultural movement in the 1880s.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nagorno-Karabakh War ==
During the Soviet era, Armenians and Azerbaijanis coexisted peacefully. When the conflict over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] broke out, however, this changed radically. The initial Armenian claims to Nagorno-Karabakh, in Azerbaijan, yielding from [[Armenian nationalism]] were laid in late 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Black garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through peace and war |last1=De Waal |first1=Thomas |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher= New York University Press|location= New York |isbn= 0-8147-1944-9 |page= |pages= 15–20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pletup86PMQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=black+garden&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zFpETKLVFIH6lwe67vGYDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998, Armenia began accusing Azerbaijan of embarking on a campaign of destroying a cemetery of finely carved Armenian [[khachkar]]s in the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} On May 30, 2006, Azerbaijan barred the [[European Parliament]] from inspecting and examining the ancient burial site.  [[Charles Tannock]], British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] foreign affairs spokesman in the European parliament, stated, "This is very similar to the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Buddha statues]] destroyed by the [[Taliban]]. They have concreted the area over and turned it into a military camp. If they have nothing to hide then we should be allowed to inspect the terrain."  [[Hannes Swoboda]], an Austrian Socialist MEP and member of the committee barred from examining the site, said he hopes a visit can be arranged in the autumn.  He stated that "if they do not allow us to go, we have a clear hint that something bad has happened. If something is hidden we want to ask why. It can only be because some of the allegations are true." He also warned: "One of the major elements of any country that wants to come close to Europe is that the cultural heritage of neighbors is respected."&lt;ref name = "PanArmenian"&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=18235  PanArmenian].&lt;/ref&gt;

A key advocate of Azerbaijani nationalism is [[Farida Mammadova]], who has made anti-Armenian statements.{{citation needed|reason=no source is presented|date=November 2010}} In response to desecration of Azerbaijani holy sanctuary ''Agadede'' south of [[Yerevan]] in 2005, Mammadova said that "it is known, that on whole planet exactly the Armenian people is distinguished by the absence of spiritual and other human values. And it is them who are used to appropriate the cultures of other nations while living in another state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.day.az/print/news/armenia/38422.html |title=Фарида Мамедова: "Разрушив захоронение "Агадеде", армяне в очередной раз пытаются посягнуть на историю Азербайджана" |trans-title=Farida Mamedova: "Having destroyed the Agadede sanctuary, Armenians are again trying to lay claims on Azerbaijani history |publisher=[[Day.az]] |date=January 6, 2006 |accessdate=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117040201/http://www.day.az/print/news/armenia/38422.html |archivedate=November 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thomas de Waal]], Mammadova has grasped the Albanian theory after studying the history of [[Caucasian Albania]] and used it to push the Armenians out of Caucasus altogether. She has placed Caucasian Albania on the territory of modern [[Armenia]]: all the territories, churches and monasteries in Armenia have appeared Albanian. Mammadova had visited the [[Gandzasar monastery]] in 1975 and read the inscription on facade "I Hasan-Jalal, built this church for my people of [[Aghvank]]..." referring to an ancient name of Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Black garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through peace and war |last1=De Waal |first1=Thomas |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher= New York University Press|location= New York |isbn= 0-8147-1944-9 |page= 154 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pletup86PMQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Black+Garden&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KFhETKKsAoH88Abz1NXBDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mamedova&amp;f=false |accessdate= July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bambassi''' is an [[Omotic]] [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] [[language]] spoken in [[Ethiopia]] around the towns of [[Bambasi]] and Didessa in the area east of [[Asosa]] in [[Benishangul-Gumuz Region]].&lt;ref name=e18&gt;{{Ethnologue18|myf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parent language group is the [[Mao languages|East Mao group]]. Alternative names for the language are Bambeshi, Siggoyo, Amam, Fadiro, Northern Mao, Didessa and Kere.

The most current information on the number of Bambassi speakers is not known, as the 2007 census grouped the Mao languages together, despite low lexical similarity. 33,683 mother tongue speakers of Maogna (covering Bambassi, [[Hozo language|Hozo]] and [[Seze language|Seze]]) were listed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/images/documents/pdf_files/regional/CountryLevel.pdf Ethiopia 2007 Census]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bemba language''', ''ChiBemba'' (also ''Cibemba, Ichibemba, Icibemba'' and ''Chiwemba''), is a major [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language spoken primarily in north-eastern [[Zambia]] by the [[Bemba people]] and as a [[lingua franca]] by about 18 related ethnic groups, including the [[Lala-Bisa language|Bisa people]] of Mpika and Lake Bangweulu, and to a lesser extent  in [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Botswana]]. Including all its dialects, Bemba is the most spoken indigenous language in Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/country/ZM/languages Zambia] at ''Ethnologue''&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Lamba language]] is closely related and some people consider it a dialect of Bemba.

The Bemba people are descendants of inhabitants of the [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba kingdom]], which existed in what is now the [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in north-eastern Zambia.

Bemba is one of the most widely spoken languages in Zambia, spoken by many people who live in urban areas, and is one of Zambia's seven recognized regional languages. Zambia's first president, [[Kenneth Kaunda]], though Malawian by descent, was raised in a Bemba-speaking community, and two of the four Zambian president since have been Bemba-speakers. The third president, Levy Mwanawasa, was a Lenje, who belong to the Bantu Botatwe [three people] ethnic grouping that comprises the Tonga-Lenje-Ila peoples. The Fourth President, Rupiah Bwezani Banda was a Chewa from the Eastern Province. In the years after the [[Movement for Multi-Party Democracy|MMD]] took power in 1991, it was accused numerous times of promoting Bemba over other regional languages in the country.&lt;ref&gt;"UNHCR | Refworld | Chronology for Bemba in Zambia", http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,469f2faa2,469f38f7c,0.html. Retrieved 3 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the lingua franca of the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] is a dialect of [[Nyanja|Nyanja language]], it incorporates numerous Bemba words and expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Lubasi &amp; Bwalya 2013, ''Town Nyanja: a learner's guide to Zambia's emerging national language''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==

Bemba has several dialects, many being varieties of Bemba spoken by other tribes which have historically fallen under Bemba influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nalrc.indiana.edu/brochures/bemba.pdf|title=Bemba language &amp; culture|last=NALRC|first=|date=|website=nalrc.indiana.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include Chishinga, Lomotwa, Ngoma, Nwesi, Kabende, Luunda, Mukulu, Ng’umbo, and Unga, which is spoken by [[Twa]] pygmies and sometimes considered a separate language (Nurse 2003). The Twa of Bangweulu speak another dialect of Bemba.

A form known as Town Bemba, with slightly altered grammar and incorporating many [[English language|English]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]] loanwords, is used in the major cities of the [[Copperbelt]].

==Phonology and orthography==

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}

The orthographical system in common use, originally introduced by [[Edward Steere]], is quite phonetic. Its letters, with their approximate phonetic values, are given below.

|}
&lt;/center&gt;
It has become increasingly common to use 'c' in place of 'ch'. In common with other Bantu languages, as affixes are added, combinations of vowels may contract and consonants may change. For example, 'aa' changes to a long 'a', 'ae' and 'ai' change to 'e', and 'ao' and 'au' change to 'o (in other cases, a 'y' is often used to separate other combinations of vowels). The nasal 'n' changes to 'm' before 'b' or 'p', and is pronounced ŋ before 'k' or 'g'; after 'n', 'l' changes to 'd'. These rules will all be implicit in the tables given below.

Like many Bantu languages, Bemba is [[tonal languages|tonal]], with two tones; however, tone has limited effect on meaning as the number of words that would otherwise be confused is small. Stress tends to fall on the prefix, when it exists, and can lead to subtle differences of meaning (see the verb forms below).

==Grammar==

Many of the main features of Bemba grammar are fairly typical of Bantu languages: it is [[agglutinative]], depends mainly on [[prefixes]], has a system of several noun classes, a large set of verbal aspects and tenses, very few actual adjectives, and, like English, has a [[word order]] that is [[subject-verb-object]]. Most of the classification here is taken from that given by Schoeffer, Sheane and Cornwallis.&lt;ref&gt;Schoeffer, West Sheane, J.H.; Madan, Arthur Cornwallis (1907). "A Grammar of the Bemba Language as Spoken in North-east Rhodesia". Clarendon Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nouns===
Bemba nouns are divided into several partially-semantic classes. They are indicated by their prefixes and are generally similar but not always identical to the ''concord prefixes'', attached to verbs they govern, adjectives qualifying them, and pronouns standing for them. By one convention, based on the plural, they are arranged as follows (most alternate forms are caused by phonetic considerations):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class
! Singular prefix
! Concord prefix (singular)
! Plural prefix
! Concord prefix (plural)
! Notes
|-
| 1
| mu-, mw-, m-
| a (verbs), mu (adjectives), u/w (pronouns)
| ba-
| ba-
| persons, and several inanimate nouns
|-
| 2
| mu-
| u- (sometimes mu- for adjectives)
| mi-
| i- (sometimes mi- for adjectives)
| generally inanimate nouns, and most trees and fruit
|-
| 3
| n-, lu-
| i (sometimes n- for adjectives), lu-
| n-
| shi-
| generally not human nouns
|-
| 4
| chi-/ch- (ichi-)
| chi-/ch-
| fi-/fy-/f- (ifi-)
| fi-/fy-/f-
| augmentatives, kinds, languages
|-
| 5
| li-, ku-, bu-, lu-
| same as noun prefix
| ma-
| ya- (sometimes ma- for adjectives)
| Plural can be used for singulars of class 3 to emphasise larger number or size
|-
| 6
| ka-
| ka
| tu-
| tu-
| diminutives
|-
| 7
| bu-
| bu-
| none
| none
| abstract nouns
|-
| 8
| ku-
| ku-
| none
| none
| infinitives
|-
| 9
| ku-, mu-, pa-
| same as noun prefix
|
|
| not strictly a noun class (see below)
|}

The prefixes in class 9 essentially indicate case: 'ku-' corresponds to 'to' or 'from', 'mu-' to 'in', 'into', or 'out of', and 'pa-' to 'at'.

===Adjectives===

As is common in Bantu languages, adjectives follow the words they qualify, and take the adjectival concord prefixes, but there are not many of them in the strictest sense. Adverbs, relative clauses, or 'descriptors', often fulfil their function instead. Descriptors are placed after the noun, with the particle '-a', and the relevant pronoun prefix between them: ''chintu cha nomba'', 'new thing'.

===Numerals===

The numbers from 1 to 10 are:

&lt;center&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
|-align="center"
|align="right"|English:|| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10
|-align="center"
|align="center"|Bemba: || mo || bili || tatu || ne || sano || mutanda || chine lubali || chine konse konse || pabula || ikumi
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The numerals 1-5 take adjectival concord prefixes (except for class 1 singular: ''muntu umo,'' 'one person'). The numerals 6-10 are left unchanged. 'Ikumi' has the plural 'makumi', which can be used as a noun with 'na' (and, with) to form all numbers up to 99: for example, ''makumi yatatu na pabula'', 'thirty nine'. 100 is 'mwanda', with plural 'myanda'.

===Pronouns===

The class-independent personal pronouns are: 'ine' (1st person sg.), 'iwe' (2nd person sg.), 'ifwe' (1st person pl.), 'imwe' (2nd person pl.). These are absolute, in the sense that they stand alone, and cannot appear as subjects or objects as they are. There are separate possessive pronouns, and the third person pronouns depend on class. There are also demonstrative pronouns, divided both by class and into  three kinds by [[deixis]] ('this one, that one, and that one over there'), and relative pronouns are formed from these.

===Verbs===

Verbs have simple forms, usually ending in '-a' (everything before the 'a' being the 'stem', 'root' or 'radical'), and are [[agglutination|agglutinated]] according to person, number and class of subject and object, tense, mood, voice, aspect and whether they are affirmative or negative. Further, their stems change to indicate various other shades of meaning. The following rules can all be combined in a mostly straightforward manner, Bemba being [[agglutinative]] and not [[inflective]], but there are still some exceptions.

====Subject and object prefixes====

The subject prefixes and object [[infixes]] for the personal pronouns are given below. 
These can vary slightly according to mood, and the subject prefixes change for negative verbs. Where they are different, object prefixes are given in brackets.

&lt;center&gt;
{|class="wikitable"
|-align="center"
|align="left"| '''Person''' || '''1st sg.''' || '''2nd sg.''' || '''3rd sg.''' || '''1st pl.''' || '''2nd pl.''' || '''3rd pl.'''
|-align="center"
|align="left"| '''Affirmative'''|| n- || u- (ku-) || a- (mu-) || tu- || mu- || ba-
|-align="center"
|align="left"| '''Negative''' || nshi-, shi- || tau- || taa-, ta- || tatu- || tamu- || taba-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The subject prefix is placed first, and then the object infix. When the subject or object is a specific noun in a given class, the verbal concord prefix of this class is used, and the negative form adds the prefix 'ta-' before this.

====Tenses and Aspects====

The classification given here is that presented by Schoeffer. 

Some of these require a modified stem, changing final 'a' to 'ile' if the preceding vowel is 'a', 'i' or 'u', and to 'ele' if it is 'e' or 'o', or, if the last consonant is [[nasal stop|nasal]], changing the 'a' to 'ine' or 'ene' accordingly. There are irregularities in several verbs.

The tense infixes are given below. They come after the subject and object prefixes, and before the verb stem, except for the recent, completed or historic past in 'na-', which appears at the very beginning. Stress is marked with an acute (´) accent.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Tense/aspect

|}

====Moods====

The moods correspond closely to the Bantu norms.

=====Imperative=====
The simple singular imperative is identical to the 'dictionary' form of the verb consisting of the stem and the suffix '-a', changing to an '-e' if an object prefix is used - there is no subject prefix. The simple plural imperative changes '-a' to '-eni'. Prefixing 'aku-' or 'uka-', adds a sense of instruction to resume or continue an action. An emphatic form can be given by using the subject pronoun prefix (generally of class 1) and following this by the infix '-inda-'.

=====Subjunctive=====

The subjunctive is used hypothetically,  as an indirect imperative, in exhortations, and in subordinate clauses, similarly but not identically to the subjunctive of many European languages. The common feature is a change of the final '-a' of the verb to '-e'. Its forms are given below. Here V stands for the verb stem, and P for any pronoun prefixes (infixes). The usual phonological rules apply.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Tense/aspect
! Infix
! Notes
|-
| Simple present
| P-V-e
| Used for the present and for verbs for which time is not specified
|-
| Present of movement
| ka-P-V-e
| Expresses a change in position, state or mental attitude
|-
| Present of insistence, exhortative
| na-P-V-e
| Similar to a first-person plural imperative
|-
| Future immediate
| P-le-V-a
| Same as the indicative
|-
| Future immediate of insistence
| na-P-le-V-a
| Also used as an exhortative, or indirect imperative; can take plural in -eni when used imperatively
|-
| Future remote momentary
| P-ka-V-e
| Used for a single action in the remote future
|-
| Future remote continuous
| P-kale-V-a
| Used for a progressive or habitual action in the remote future
|-
| Future remote of insistence
| shina-P-V-e
| Used as an indirect imperative for some unknown remote future time
|}

The infinitive, strictly a verbal noun, has two forms. The simple form has prefix 'ku-' added to the simple form, as mentioned above, and the habitual infinitive has prefix 'kula-'.

====Voices====

The passive is formed by placing the infix '-w-' before the last vowel of the verb, but it is not frequently used. A 'neutral' voice can be formed by using '-ik-' instead if the preceding vowel is a, i or u, and '-ek-' if the preceding vowel is e or o. This form is differs in meaning from the passive in that it emphasises the state resulting from an action rather than the action itself (cf. English 'the pot is broken', as opposed to 'the ball is kicked').

====Negation====

Generally, the indicative prefixes 'ta-' to the subject prefix except for the first person singular which changes to 'nshi' or 'shi'. Generally, the subjunctive adds 'i' after the pronoun prefixes and in most cases changes a final 'e' to 'a'. The infinitive occasionally uses the negative 'te'. However, the precise rules are more complex, and the forms depend more finely on tense, aspect and mood. When the negative is used with the imperfect 'le', it is often in the sense of action not yet done, and is referred to by Schoeffer as a separate 'deferred tense'.

====Other forms====

There are several other verb forms which change the stem by adding an extra syllable before the final 'a'. These are given below.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Tense/aspect
! Form
! Notes
|-
| Applied
| The modified stem, with 'a' (instead of 'e' for the specific past).
| Used to make an object indirect, usually translated by adding a preposition like 'for' after the verb
|-
| Completive
| Doubles vowel-consonant pair of the applied stem (e.g., ''fikila'' becomes ''fikilila'', from ''fika'', 'to arrive')
| Expresses completion or finality of an action
|-
| Reciprocal
| V-na (or V-nya if V ends in y)
| Expressing actions done to 'each other'
|-
| Causative
| Softens the last consonant accordingly: 'ba', 'pa' to 'fya'; 'nda', 'ka' 'la', 'sa', 'ta', to 'shya' or 'ishya', 'ushya'; adds 'y' before the 'a' of 'ema', 'ima', 'uma', 'ana'; adds 'ik' before the 'a' of 'ala', 'ama', 'ana'
| Several exceptions exist; 'ishya' and 'ushya' is particularly common for verbs of colour
|-
| Intensive
| Changes 'a' to 'ishya' if preceding vowel is 'a', 'i', 'u'; changes 'a' to 'eshya' if 'e', 'o'
| Adds emphasis or a sense of energy to the verb
|-
| Reversive
| Changes 'a' to 'ula' or 'ulula' if preceding vowel is 'a', 'i', 'u'; changes 'a' to 'ola' or 'olola' if 'e', 'o'
| Expresses a reversal of an action (cf. English 'do', 'undo')
|-
| Frequentative
| Changes 'a' to 'ula'
| Expresses frequent repetition of an action; translatable by the adverb 'repeatedly'
|-
| Reflexive
| Prefixes 'i' to the verb stem
| Expresses doing 'to oneself'
|}

There are also several compound tenses, many using the copula 'kuli' and 'kuba'.

===Conjunctions===

These are used to introduce coordinating or subordinate clauses, similarly to their use in English.

==Basic phrases==

*ee - yes
*awe - no
*Uli shani? - how are you (informal)
*Muli shani? - how are you (formal)
*Shaleenipo - goodbye
*Ishina lyandi ni... - My name is...
*umuntu - person
*umunandi - friend
*umwana - child
*iciBemba - the Bemba language
*na - and, with
*nga - like, as
*suma (adj.) - good/beautiful
*onse (adj.) - all
*uluceelo (adj) - morning

==Sample==

''Abantu bonse bafyalwa abalubuka nokulingana mu mucinshi nensambu. Balikwata amano nokutontonkanya, eico bafwile ukulacita ifintu ku banabo mu mutima wa bwananyina.''

All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood. (First article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].)

== Literature ==
There is a sizeable amount of literature in Bemba. There are narratives, poems and plays. Some of the notable writers in Bemba include Stephen Mpashi, Chongo Kasonkomona,Chishimba, Paul Mushindo, Bwalya Chilangwa, Mwila Launshi and Kambole, among others. 

A lot of the novels and narratives in Bemba were written between the period 1950 and 1980. Recently, very few creative works are published in Zambia mainly due to two reasons: the readership is generally poor and secondly, because of the first reason, publishers tend to hesitate to publish creative works in Bemba, especially novels of substantial length, for financial reasons due to the likely low levels of readership and thus profit. Instead, there are many short stories and novellas in Bemba literature.

Despite these hiccups, such as poor readership and lack of publishing, the quality of the works that are published in Bemba is often high. Moreover, there seem to be many talented writers who would like to write in this language but could not because of the reasons that have been given above and others{{Clarify|date=September 2015}} that are related.

In terms of literally criticism, a lot of the works in Bemba language have not been reviewed and criticised. This is because there are very few literary critics in Bemba, though slowly growing. Some of these include Lutato and Shadreck Kondala,&lt;ref&gt;Shadreck Kondala. 2013. ''Nature of Plots in Bemba Novels: The Case of Chilangwa’s "Sheli Wa Citatu", Kasonkomona’s "Ubuseko Mu Bulanda", and Launshi’s "Ukutangila Tekufika".'' [http://dspace.unza.zm:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/2306/Kondala.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Online access]&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Classic Bemba books include ''Uwauma Nafyala'', ''Pano Calo'' and ''Imilimo ya bena Kale''.

Lydia L., a former prostitute born in 1939, invited older men to live with her in a relationship or to care for the elderly. The men were later murdered by her and her helper, Siggi S. However, a turnaround occurred when he aide herself reported the crimes to the police, confessing her participation in them as well.

The following relationships were assigned to Lydia L.:

* Ludwig G. from [[Biebertal]]. In 1983, he met the women at the age of 82. In September 1985, he pointed at Lydia for being his sole heir, and on January 5, 1986, he died in a hospital.
* Wilhelm S., a master mason from the [[Sauerland]].
* Paul P., who died at the age of 83 in February 1991.
* Alois M.
* Günter S., 74, strangled in June 1994.
* Adolf B. from [[Melsungen]], was suffocated in September 1994 with a pillow.
* Paul G., stunned by Lydia L. in April 1995 and then strangled by Siggi S.

[[File:Chartist meeting on Kennington Common by William Edward Kilburn 1848 - restoration1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Photograph of the Great Chartist Meeting on [[Kennington Common]], London in 1848]]

'''Chartism''' was a [[Working class|working-class]] movement for political reform in Britain that existed from 1838 to 1857. It took its name from the People's Charter of 1838 and was a national protest movement, with particular strongholds of support in [[Northern England]], the [[East Midlands]], the [[Staffordshire Potteries]], the [[Black Country]], and the [[South Wales Valleys]]. Support for the movement was at its highest in 1839, 1842, and 1848, when petitions signed by millions of working people were presented to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. The strategy employed was to use the scale of support which these petitions and the accompanying mass meetings demonstrated to put pressure on politicians to concede manhood [[suffrage]]. Chartism thus relied on constitutional methods to secure its aims, though there were some who became involved in insurrectionary activities, notably in south Wales and in [[Yorkshire]].

The People's Charter called for six reforms to make the political system more democratic:
# A vote for every man twenty-one years of age, of sound mind, and not undergoing punishment for a crime.
# The [[secret ballot]] to protect the elector in the exercise of his vote.
# No property qualification for Members of Parliament in order to allow the constituencies to return the man of their choice.
# Payment of Members, enabling tradesmen, working men, or other persons of modest means to leave or interrupt their livelihood to attend to the interests of the nation.
# Equal constituencies, securing the same amount of representation for the same number of electors, instead of allowing less populous constituencies to have as much or more weight than larger ones.
# Annual Parliamentary elections, thus presenting the most effectual check to bribery and intimidation, since no purse could buy a constituency under a system of universal manhood suffrage in each twelve-month period.

Chartists saw themselves fighting against political corruption and for democracy in an industrial society, but attracted support beyond the radical political groups for economic reasons, such as opposing wage cuts and [[unemployment]].&lt;ref name=Chase2007&gt;Malcolm Chase, ''Chartism: A New History'' (Manchester UP, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyd Hilton, ''A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People?: England 1783–1846'' (2006) pp&amp;nbsp;612–21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
After the passing of the [[Reform Act 1832]], which failed to extend the vote beyond those owning property, the political leaders of the working class made speeches claiming that there had been a great act of betrayal. This sense that the working class had been betrayed by the middle class was strengthened by the actions of the [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] governments of the 1830s. Notably, the hated new [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law Amendment]] was passed in 1834, depriving working people of [[outdoor relief]] and driving the poor into workhouses, where families were separated.  It was the massive wave of opposition to this measure in the north of England in the late 1830s that gave Chartism the numbers that made it a mass movement. It seemed that only securing the vote for working men would change things, and indeed [[Dorothy Thompson (historian)|Dorothy Thompson]], the pre-eminent historian of Chartism, defined the movement as the time when "thousands of working people considered that their problems could be solved by the political organization of the country."&lt;ref name=Thompson1984&gt;Dorothy Thompson, ''The Chartists: Popular Politics in the Industrial Revolution'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} In 1836 the [[London Working Men's Association]] was founded by [[William Lovett]] and [[Henry Hetherington]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/minute-book Minute Book of the London Working Men’s Association.] [[British Library]] 2018. Retrieved 01 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; providing a platform for Chartists in the south east. The origins of [[Chartism in Wales]] can be traced to the foundation in the autumn of 1836 of Carmarthen Working Men's Association.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = John Frost: A study in Chartism|last = Williams|first = David|publisher = University of Wales Press Board|year = 1939|isbn = |location = Cardiff|pages = 100, 104, 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press===
Both nationally and locally a Chartist press thrived in the form of periodicals, which were important to the movement for their news, editorials, poetry and (especially in 1848) reports on international developments. They reached a huge audience.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Allen and Owen R. Ashton, ''Papers for the People: A Study of the Chartist Press'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Poor Man's Guardian]]'' in the 1830s, edited by [[Henry Hetherington]], dealt with questions of class solidarity, manhood suffrage, property, and temperance; and condemned the Reform Act of 1832. The paper explored the rhetoric of violence versus non-violence, or what its writers referred to as moral versus physical force.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Breton, "Violence and the Radical Imagination", ''Victorian Periodicals Review'', Spring 2011, 44#1 pp&amp;nbsp;24–41&lt;/ref&gt; It was succeeded as the voice of radicalism by an even more famous paper: the ''[[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|Northern Star and Leeds General Advertiser]]''. The Star was published between 1837 and 1852, and in 1839 was the best-selling provincial newspaper in Britain, with a circulation of 50,000 copies. Like other Chartist papers it was often read aloud in coffee houses, workplaces and the open air.&lt;ref&gt;Cris Yelland, "Speech and Writing in the Northern Star", ''Labour History Review'', Spring 2000, 65#1 pp&amp;nbsp;22–40&lt;/ref&gt; Other Chartist periodicals included the ''Northern Liberator'' (1837–40), ''English Chartist Circular'' (1841–3), and the ''Midland Counties' Illuminator'' (1841). The papers gave justifications for the demands of the People's Charter, accounts of local meetings, commentaries on education and temperance and a great deal of poetry. The papers also advertised upcoming meetings, typically organised by local grass roots branches, held either in public houses, or in their own halls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Protest and the Politics of Space and Place, 1789–1848|year = 2015|first = Katrina|last = Navickas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research of the distribution of Chartist meetings in London which were advertised in the Norther Star shows that the movement was not uniformly spread across the Metropolis, but was instead clustered in the city's West End where a group of Chartist tailors had shops, as well as in Shoreditch in the east, and relied heavily on pubs that also supported local friendly societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From Chartist Newspaper to Digital Map of Grass-roots Meetings, 1841–44: Documenting Workflows|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13555502.2017.1301179|journal = The Journal of Victorian Culture|date = 2017-03-20|doi = 10.1080/13555502.2017.1301179|first1 = Katrina|last1 = Navickas|first2 = Adam|last2 = Crymble}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers also found denunciations of [[imperialism]]—the [[First Opium War]] (1839–42) was condemned—and of the arguments of [[free trade]]rs about the civilizing and pacifying influences of free trade.&lt;ref&gt;Shijie Guan, "Chartism and the First Opium War", ''History Workshop'', (Oct 1987), Issue 24, pp&amp;nbsp;17–31&lt;/ref&gt;

==People's Charter of 1838==
In 1837, six [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] and six working men, including [[William Lovett]] (from the [[London Working Men's Association]], set up in 1836) formed a committee, which in 1838 published the ''People's Charter''. This set out the six main aims of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chartistancestors.co.uk/six-points/|title=The six points {{!}} chartist ancestors|work=chartist ancestors|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The achievement of these aims would give working men a say in law-making: they would be able to vote, and their vote would be protected by a secret ballot; and they would be able to stand for election to the House of Commons as a result of the removal of property qualifications and the introduction of payment for MPs. None of these demands was new, but the People's Charter was to become one of the most famous political manifestos of 19th century Britain.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

==Beginnings==
[[Image:ChartistRiot.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Chartist riot]]
[[Image:The national convention. As it met on Monday the 4th of February, 1839, at the British Coffee House ca. 1839 LCCN2004669356.jpg|250px|right|The national convention. As it met on Monday the 4th of February, 1839, at the [[British Coffee House]]]]


Chartism was launched in 1838 by a series of enormous meetings in Birmingham, Glasgow and the north of England. A huge meeting was held on [[Kersal Moor]] near [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Lancashire]], on 24 September 1838 with speakers from all over the country. Speaking in favour of manhood suffrage, [[Joseph Rayner Stephens]] declared that Chartism was a "knife and fork, a bread and cheese question".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chartism.html Victorianweb.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219044548/http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chartism.html |date=February 19, 2008 }}, Retrieved on 2008-02-07&lt;/ref&gt; These words indicate the importance of economic factors in the launch of Chartism. If, as the movement came together, there were different priorities amongst local leaders, the Charter and the Star soon created a national, and largely united, campaign of national protest. John Bates, an activist, recalled:

{{quote|There were [radical] associations all over the county, but there was a great lack of cohesion.  One wanted the ballot, another manhood suffrage and so on&amp;nbsp;... The radicals were without unity of aim and method, and there was but little hope of accomplishing anything.  When, however, the People's Charter was drawn up&amp;nbsp;... clearly defining the urgent demands of the working class, we felt we had a real bond of union; and so transformed our Radical Association into local Chartist centres&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=Thompson1984/&gt;{{rp|60}}}}

The movement organised a National Convention in London in early 1839 to facilitate the presentation of the first petition. Delegates used the term MC, Member of Convention, to identify themselves; the convention undoubtedly saw itself as an alternative parliament.&lt;ref name=Charlton1997&gt;Charlton, John, ''The Chartists: The First National Workers' Movement'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} In June 1839, the petition, signed by 1.3 million working people, was presented to the House of Commons, but MPs voted, by a large majority, not to hear the petitioners. At the Convention, there was talk of a general [[Strike action|strike]] or "sacred month". In the West Riding of Yorkshire and [[Chartism in Wales|in south Wales]], anger went even deeper, and underground preparations for a rising were undoubtedly made.

===Newport Rising===
{{main|Newport Rising}}
[[File:Dramatisation of the trial of the Chartists at Shire Hall, Monmouth, including background information 1 of 7.ogv|thumb|left|Dramatisation of the trial of the Chartists at [[Shire Hall, Monmouth]], including background information]]
Several outbreaks of violence ensued, leading to arrests and trials. One of the leaders of the movement, [[John Frost (Chartist)|John Frost]], on trial for treason, claimed in his defence that he had toured his territory of industrial Wales urging people not to break the law, although he was himself guilty of using language that some might interpret as a call to arms. Dr [[William Price (physician)|William Price]] of [[Llantrisant]]—more of a maverick than a mainstream Chartist—described Frost as putting "a sword in my hand and a rope around my neck".&lt;ref&gt;David Williams, ''John Frost: a study in Chartism'' (1969) p 193&lt;/ref&gt; Hardly surprisingly, there are no surviving letters outlining plans for insurrection, but physical force Chartists had undoubtedly started organising. By early autumn men were being drilled and armed in south Wales, and also in the West Riding. Secret cells were set up, covert meetings were held in the Chartist Caves at [[Llangynidr]] and weapons were manufactured as the Chartists armed themselves. Behind closed doors and in pub back rooms, plans were drawn up for a mass protest.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

On the night of 3–4 November 1839 Frost led several thousand marchers through South Wales to the [[Westgate Hotel]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], where there was a confrontation. It seems that Frost and other local leaders were expecting to seize the town and trigger a national uprising. The result of the Newport Rising was a disaster for Chartism. The hotel was occupied by armed soldiers. A brief, violent, and bloody battle ensued. Shots were fired by both sides, although most contemporaries agree that the soldiers holding the building had vastly superior firepower. The Chartists were forced to retreat in disarray: more than twenty were killed, at least another fifty wounded.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

Testimonies exist from contemporaries, such as the Yorkshire Chartist Ben Wilson, that Newport was to have been the signal for a national uprising. Despite this significant setback the movement remained remarkably buoyant, and remained so until late 1842. Whilst the majority of Chartists, under the leadership of [[Feargus O'Connor]], concentrated on petitioning for Frost, Williams and [[William Jones (Chartist)|William Jones]] to be pardoned, significant minorities in Sheffield and Bradford planned their own risings in response. [[Samuel Holberry]] led an abortive rising in Sheffield on 12 January; and on 26 January Robert Peddie attempted similar action in Bradford. In both Sheffield and Bradford spies had kept magistrates aware of the conspirators' plans, and these attempted risings were easily quashed. Frost and two other Newport leaders, Jones and Williams, were [[penal transportation|transported]]. Holberry and Peddie received long prison sentences with hard labour; Holberry died in prison and became a Chartist martyr.&lt;ref name=Chase2007/&gt;{{rp|135–8,152–7}}

==1842==
"1842 was the year in which more energy was hurled against the authorities than in any other of the 19th century".&lt;ref name=Thompson1984/&gt;{{rp|295}} In early May 1842, a second petition, of over three million signatures, was submitted, and was yet again rejected by Parliament. The ''[[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|Northern Star]]'' commented on the rejection:

{{quote|Three and half millions have quietly, orderly, soberly, peaceably but firmly asked of their rulers to do justice; and their rulers have turned a deaf ear to that protest. Three and a half millions of people have asked permission to detail their wrongs, and enforce their claims for RIGHT, and the 'House' has resolved they should not be heard!  Three and a half millions of the slave-class have holden out the olive branch of peace to the enfranchised and privileged classes and sought for a firm and compact union, on the principle of EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW; and the enfranchised and privileged have refused to enter into a treaty!  The same class is to be a slave class still. The mark and brand of inferiority is not to be removed. The assumption of inferiority is still to be maintained. The people are not to be free.&lt;ref name=Charlton1997/&gt;{{rp|34}}}}

The depression of 1842 led to [[1842 General Strike|a wave of strikes]], as workers responded to the wage cuts imposed by employers. Calls for the implementation of the Charter were soon included alongside demands for the restoration of wages to previous levels.  Working people went on strike in 14 English and 8 Scottish counties, principally in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], [[Lancashire]], [[Cheshire]], Yorkshire, and the Strathclyde region of Scotland. Typically, strikers resolved to cease work until wages were increased "until the People's charter becomes the Law of the Land". How far these strikes were directly Chartist in inspiration "was then, as now, a subject of much controversy".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Royle, ''Chartism'' (1996), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Leeds Mercury'' headlined them "The Chartist Insurrection", but suspicion also hung over the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] that manufacturers among its members deliberately closed mills to stir-up unrest. At the time, these disputes were collectively known as the ''Plug Plot'' as, in many cases, protesters removed the plugs from steam boilers powering industry to prevent their use. Amongst historians writing in the 20th century, the term General Strike was increasingly used.&lt;ref name=Jenkins1980/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.C. Mather, "The General Strike of 1842", in John Stevenson R. Quinault (eds), ''Popular Protest and Public Order'' (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern historians prefer the description "strike wave".&lt;ref name=Chase2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charlton1997/&gt; In contrast, Mick Jenkins in his ''The General Strike of 1842''&lt;ref name=Jenkins1980&gt;{{cite book|title=The General Strike of 1842|last=Jenkins|first=Mick|publisher=Lawrence and Wishart|location=London|isbn=978-0853155300|date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a [[Marxism|Marxist]] interpretation, showing the strikes as highly organized with sophisticated political intentions. Unrest began in the Potteries of Staffordshire in early August, spreading north to Cheshire and Lancashire (where at Manchester a meeting of the Chartist national executive endorsed the strikes on the 16th). The strikes had begun spreading in Scotland and West Yorkshire from the 13th. There were outbreaks of serious violence, including property destruction and the ambushing of police convoys, in the Potteries and the West Riding.  Though the government deployed soldiers to suppress violence, it was the practical problems in sustaining an indefinite stoppage that ultimately defeated the strikers. The drift back to work began on 19 August. Only Lancashire and Cheshire were still strike-bound by September, the Manchester powerloom weavers being the last to return to work on 26 September.&lt;ref name=Chase2007/&gt;{{rp|223}}

The state hit back. Several Chartist leaders, including O'Connor, [[George Julian Harney]], and [[Thomas Cooper (poet)|Thomas Cooper]] were arrested.  During the late summer of 1842 hundreds were incarcerated – in the Potteries alone 116 men and women went to prison. A smaller number, but still amounting to many dozens – such as William Ellis, who was convicted on perjured evidence – were [[Penal transportation|transported]].   However, the government's most ambitious prosecution, personally led by the Attorney General, of O'Connor and 57 others (including almost all Chartism's national executive) failed: none were convicted of the serious charges, and those found guilty of minor offences were never actually sentenced. Cooper alone of the national Chartist leadership was convicted (at a different trial), having spoken at strike meetings in the Potteries.  He was to write a long poem in prison called "The Purgatory of Suicides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/36074|title=Sedition, Chartism, and Epic Poetry in Thomas Cooper's The Purgatory of Suicides|first=Stephanie|last=Kuduk|date=1 June 2001|publisher=|journal=Victorian Poetry|volume=39|issue=2|pages=165–186|accessdate=27 April 2018|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/vp.2001.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mid-1840s==
Despite this second set of arrests, Chartist activity continued. Beginning in 1843, O'Connor suggested that the land contained the solution to workers' problems. This idea evolved into the [[Chartist Co-operative Land Company]], later called the [[National Land Company]]. Workers would buy shares in the company, and the company would use those funds to purchase estates that would be subdivided into 2, 3, and 4 acre (8,000, 12,400 and 16,000&amp;nbsp;m²) lots. Between 1844 and 1848, five estates were purchased, subdivided, and built on, and then settled by lucky shareholders, who were chosen by lot. Unfortunately for O'Connor, in 1848 a Select Committee was appointed by Parliament to investigate the financial viability of the scheme, and it was ordered that it be shut down. Cottages built by the Chartist Land Company are still standing and inhabited today in [[Oxfordshire]], [[Worcestershire]], [[Gloucestershire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartists.net/Chartist-Land-Plan-1845-50.htm|title=Welcome to Chartist Ancestors - chartist ancestors|website=chartist ancestors|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the outskirts of London. [[Rosedene, Chartist cottage|Rosedene]], a Chartist cottage in [[Dodford, Worcestershire]], is owned and maintained by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], and is open to visitors by appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/rosedene|title=Rosedene|website=National Trust|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates embracing Chartism also stood on numerous occasions in [[general election]]s. There were concerted campaigns in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1841|election of 1841]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1847|election of 1847]], when O'Connor was elected for Nottingham. Feargus became the only Chartist to be elected an MP; it was a remarkable victory for the movement.  More commonly, Chartist candidates participated in the open meetings, called hustings, that were the first stage of an election. They frequently won the show of hands at the hustings, but then withdrew from the poll to expose the deeply undemocratic nature of the electoral system. This is what Harney did in a widely reported challenge against Lord [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]] in [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]], [[Devon]], in 1847. The last Chartist challenge at a parliamentary poll took place at Ripon in 1859.&lt;ref name=Chase2007/&gt;{{rp|178–83,279–86,339–40}}

==1848 petition==
[[Image:Chartist Demonstration.jpg|right|thumb|Poster advertising the Great Chartist Meeting]]
With O'Connor elected an MP and [[Revolutions of 1848|Europe swept by revolution]], it was hardly surprising that Chartism re-emerged as a powerful force in 1848. On 10 April 1848, a new Chartist Convention organised a mass meeting on [[Kennington Park|Kennington Common]], which would form a procession to present a third  petition to Parliament. The estimate of the number of attendees varies depending on the sources (O'Connor said 300,000; the government, 15,000; ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper suggested 50,000). Historians say 150,000.&lt;ref name=Goodway1982&gt;David Goodway, ''[[London Chartism, 1838–1848]]'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|129–42}} The authorities were well aware that the Chartists had no intention of staging an uprising, but were still intent on a large-scale display of force to counter the challenge.  100,000 [[special constable]]s were recruited to bolster the police force.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the meeting was peaceful. The military had threatened to intervene if working people made any attempt to cross the [[Thames]], and the petition was delivered to Parliament by a small group of Chartist leaders.  The Chartists declared that their petition was signed by 6 million people, but House of Commons clerks announced that it was a lesser figure of 1.9 million. In truth, the clerks could not have done their work in the time allocated to them; but their figure was widely reported, along with some of the pseudonyms appended to the petition such as "Punch" and "[[Colonel Sibthorp|Sibthorp]]" (an ultra-Tory MP), and the credibility of Chartism was undermined.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

After the defeat of April 1848, there was an increase rather than a decline in Chartist activity. In [[Bingley]], Yorkshire, a group of "physical force" Chartists led by Isaac Ickeringill were involved in a huge fracas at the local [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] and later were prosecuted for rescuing two of their compatriots from the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chartists.net/Chartists-arrested-in-1848.htm Chartists.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030140458/http://www.chartists.net/Chartists-arrested-in-1848.htm |date=2008-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high-point of the Chartist threat to the establishment in 1848 came not in on 10 April but in June, when there was widespread drilling and arming in the West Riding and the devising of plots in London.&lt;ref name=Goodway1982/&gt;{{rp|116–22}}&lt;ref&gt;John Saville, ''1848: The British State and the Chartist Movement'' (1987), pp.&amp;nbsp;130–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The banning of public meetings, and new legislation on sedition and treason (rushed through Parliament immediately after 10 April), drove a significant number of Chartists (including the black Londoner [[William Cuffay]]) into the planning of insurrection. Cuffay was to be transported, dying in Australia.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

O'Connor's egotism and vanity have been identified as causes in the failure of Chartism. This was a common theme in histories of the movement until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See especially R.G.Gammage, ''History of the Chartist movement'' (1854); J.T.Ward, ''Chartism'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 1980s, historians (notably [[Dorothy Thompson (historian)|Dorothy Thompson]]) have emphasised the indispensable contribution O'Connor made to Chartism. Further, she argues that the causes of the movement's decline are too complex to be blamed on one man.&lt;ref name=Thompson1984/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also James Epstein, ''Lion of Freedom: Feargus O'Connor and the Chartist Movement'' (1982); Malcolm Chase, ''Chartism: A New History'' (2007); Paul Pickering, ''Feargus O'Connor: A Political Life'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have recently shown interest in Chartism after 1848. The final National Convention—attended by only a handful—was held in 1858. Throughout the 1850s, there remained pockets of strong support for the Chartist cause in places such as the Black Country.&lt;ref name=Chase2007/&gt;{{rp|312–47}}&lt;ref&gt;Keith Flett, ''Chartism after 1848'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Charles Jones]] became a leading figure in the National Charter Association during its years of decline, together with [[George Julian Harney]], and helped to give the Chartist movement a clearer socialist direction.&lt;ref&gt;George Douglas Howard Cole: ''Ernest Jones'', in: G. D. H. Cole: ''Chartist portraits'', Macmillan, London 1941&lt;/ref&gt; Jones and Harney knew [[Karl Marx]]&lt;ref&gt;There are 52 letters from Ernest Jones to Marx between 1851 and 1868 kept.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friedrich Engels]]&lt;ref&gt;There are eight letter from Ernest Jones to Engels between 1852 and 1867 kept.&lt;/ref&gt;  personally. Marx and Engels at the same time commented on the Chartist movement and Jones' work in their letters and articles.&lt;ref&gt;''Marx-Engels-Werke'', Berlin (DDR) 1960/61, vol. 8, 9, 10, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingolf Neunübel: ''Zu einigen ausgewählten Fragen und Problemen der Zusammenarbeit von Marx und Engels mit dem Führer der revolutionären Chartisten, Ernest Jones, im Jahre 1854'', in: Beiträge zur Marx-Engels-Forschung 22. 1987, pp. 208–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kennington, the [[Brandon Estate]] features a large mural by [[Tony Hollaway]], commissioned by [[London County Council]]'s [[Edward Hollamby]] in the early 1960s, commemorating the Chartists' meeting on 10 April 1848.&lt;ref name="Pereira"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pereira|first1=Dawn|title=Henry Moore and the Welfare State|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/henry-moore/dawn-pereira-henry-moore-and-the-welfare-state-r1151315|accessdate=2 October 2017|work=Henry Moore: Sculptural Process and Public Identity|publisher=Tate Research Publication|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
During this period, some Christian churches in Britain held "that it was 'wrong for a Christian to meddle in political matters&amp;nbsp;... All of the denominations were particularly careful to disavow any political affiliation and he who was the least concerned with the 'affairs of this world' was considered the most saintly and worthy of emulation."&lt;ref name=Faulkner1916&gt;Harold Underwood Faulkner, ''Chartism and the churches: a study in democracy'' (1916)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} This was at odds with many Christian Chartists for whom Christianity was "above all practical, something that must be carried into every walk of life. Furthermore, there was no possibility of divorcing it from political science."&lt;ref name=Faulkner1916/&gt;{{rp|26}} Rev. William Hill, a [[The New Church|Swedenborgian]] minister, wrote in the ''Northern Star'': "We are commanded&amp;nbsp;... to love our neighbors as ourselves&amp;nbsp;... this command is universal in its application, whether as friend, Christian or citizen. A man may be devout as a Christian&amp;nbsp;... but if as a citizen he claims rights for himself he refuses to confer upon others, he fails to fulfill the precept of Christ".&lt;ref name=Faulkner1916/&gt;{{rp|26}}
The conflicts between these two views led many like Rev. [[Joseph Barker (minister)|Joseph Barker]] to see Britain's churches as pointless. "I have no faith in church organizations," he explained. "I believe it my duty to be a man; to live and move in the world at large; to battle with evil wherever I see it, and to aim at the annihilation of all corrupt institutions and at the establishment of all good, and generous, and useful institutions in their places."&lt;ref&gt;David Hempton, ''Methodism and politics in British society, 1750–1850'' (1984) p 213&lt;/ref&gt; To further this idea, some Christian Chartist Churches were formed where Christianity and radical politics were combined and considered inseparable. More than 20 Chartist Churches existed in Scotland by 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devine|first=T.M.|title=The Scottish Nation 1700-2000|year=2000|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780140230048|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pamphlets made the point and vast audiences came to hear lectures upon the same themes by the likes of Rev. J. R. Stephens, who was highly influential in the movement. Political preachers thus came into prominence.&lt;ref name=Faulkner1916/&gt;{{rp|27–8}}

Between late 1844 and November 1845, subscriptions were raised for the publication of a [[hymnal|hymn book]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richardjohnbr.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/hymns-and-chartists-revisited.html|title=Hymns and the Chartists revisited|website=richardjohnbr.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was apparently printed as a 64-page pamphlet and distributed for a nominal fee, although no known copy is thought to remain. In 2011, a previously unknown and uncatalogued smaller pamphlet of 16 hymns was discovered in [[Todmorden]] Library in the North of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calderdale.gov.uk/wtw/search/controlservlet?PageId=Detail&amp;DocId=102253&amp;PageNo=1|title=National Chartist Hymn Book: From Weaver to Web|first=Northgate|last=Calderdale Libraries|date=15 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is believed to be the only Chartist Hymnal in existence. Heavily influenced by dissenting Christians, the hymns are about social justice, "striking down evil doers", and blessing Chartist enterprises, rather than the conventional themes of crucifixion, heaven, and family. Rather than the crucifixion or Christ's glory, the focus of the hymns is a cry for liberty. Some of the hymns protested against the exploitation of [[child labour]] and [[slavery]]. Another of the hymns proclaimed: "Men of wealth and men of power/ Like locusts all thy gifts devour". Two of the hymns celebrate the martyrs of the movement. "Great God! Is this the Patriot's Doom?" was composed for the funeral of Samuel Holberry, the Sheffield Chartist leader, who died in prison in 1843, while another honours John Frost, Zephaniah Williams, and William Jones, the Chartist leaders transported to [[Tasmania]] in the aftermath of the [[Newport Rising|Newport rising of 1839]].

The Chartists were especially critical of the [[Church of England]] for unequal distribution of the state funds it received resulting in some bishops and higher dignitaries having grossly larger incomes than other clergy. This state of affairs led some Chartists to question the very idea of a state-sponsored church, leading them to call for an absolute [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name=Faulkner1916/&gt;{{rp|59}}

Facing severe persecution in 1839, Chartists took to attending services at churches they held in contempt to display their numerical strength and express their dissatisfaction. Often, they would forewarn the preacher and demand that he preach from texts they believed supported their cause, such as 2 Thessalonians 3:10, 2 Timothy 2:6, Matthew 19:23&lt;ref&gt;Edward Stanley, 1839, "A Sermon Preached in Norwich Cathedral, on Sunday, August 18th, 1839, by the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Norwich, before an assemblage of a body of mechanics termed Chartists"&lt;/ref&gt; and James 5:1-6.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester and Salford Advertiser, 17/8/1839&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the set-upon ministers would often preach the need to focus on things spiritual and not material, and of meekness and obedience to authority, citing such works as Romans 13:1–7 and 1 Peter 2:13–17.&lt;ref name=Faulkner1916/&gt;{{rp|38}}

===Eventual reforms===
Chartism did not directly generate any reforms. It was not until 1867 that urban working men were admitted to the franchise under the [[Reform Act 1867]], and not until 1918 that full manhood suffrage was achieved. Slowly the other points of the People's Charter were granted: secret voting was introduced in 1872 and the payment of MPs under the [[Parliament Act 1911|Parliament Act of 1911]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/members-faq-page2/#jump-link-15|''Frequently Asked Questions'', ''Parliament.UK'']&lt;/ref&gt; Annual elections remain the only Chartist demand not to be implemented. Participation in the Chartist Movement filled some working men with self-confidence: they learned to speak publicly, to send their poems and other writings off for publication, to be able, in short, to confidently articulate the feelings of working people. Many former Chartists went on to become journalists, poets, ministers, and councillors.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Griffin, "The making of the Chartists: popular politics and working-class autobiography in early Victorian Britain," English Historical Review, 538, June 2014 [http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/05/23/ehr.ceu078 in EHR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Political elites feared the Chartists in the 1830s and 1840s as a dangerous threat to national stability.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Saunders, "Chartism from above: British elites and the interpretation of Chartism", ''Historical Research'', (2008) 81#213 pp&amp;nbsp;463–484&lt;/ref&gt; In the Chartist stronghold of Manchester, the reform movement undermined the political power of the old Tory-Anglican elite that had controlled civic affairs. However, the reformers of Manchester were themselves factionalised.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Turner, "Local Politics and the Nature of Chartism: The Case of Manchester", ''Northern History'', (2008),  45#2 pp&amp;nbsp;323–345&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1848, as the movement faded, its demands appeared less threatening and were gradually enacted by other reformers.&lt;ref&gt;Margot C. Finn, ''After Chartism: Class and Nation in English Radical Politics 1848–1874'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; After 1848, middle class [[Radicals (UK)|parliamentary Radicals]] continued to press for an extension of the franchise in such organisations as the National Parliamentary and Financial Reform Association and the Reform Union. By the late 1850s, the celebrated [[John Bright]] was agitating in the country for franchise reform. However, working class radicals had not gone away. The Reform League campaigned for manhood suffrage in the 1860s, and included former Chartists amongst its ranks. Chartism has also been regarded by historians as a forerunner to the [[Labour Party (UK)|UK Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of the Twenty First Century|author=Gabriel Tortella|year=2010|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/oct/05/occupy-movement-legacy-chartism|title=Before we decide to write off the Occupy movement, let's consider the legacy of the Chartists|author=Giles Fraser|date=2012-10-05|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/ks3/history/industrial_era/the_chartists/revision/6/|title=BBC - KS3 Bitesize History = The Chartists: Revision|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonies===
Chartism was also an important influence in some British colonies. Some leaders had been transported to Australia, where they spread their beliefs. In 1854, Chartist demands were put forward by the miners at the [[Eureka Stockade]] on the [[gold]] fields at [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. Within two years of the military suppression of the Eureka revolt, the first elections of the Victorian parliament were held, with near-universal male suffrage and by secret ballot.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Serle, ''The Golden Age: A History of the Colony of Victoria'' (1963) ch 9&lt;/ref&gt; In the African colonies after 1920, there were occasional appearances of a "colonial chartism" which called for improved welfare, upgraded education, freedom of speech, and greater political representation for natives.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Bush, ''Imperialism, race, and resistance: Africa and Britain, 1919–1945'' (1999) p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Expand section|date=April 2018}}

The Chartist movement was criticised by [[Thomas Carlyle]] in his 1840 long pamphlet ''Chartism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chartism|title=Chartism|first=Thomas|last=Carlyle|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2018|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{how?|date=July 2017}}

'''Chinese people in Sweden''' include people born in the [[People's Republic of China]], or have ancestry from there. It may also include people originating from [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]]. They form a sizable community and are one the biggest Asian groups. As of 2016, there are 29,640 mainland Chinese immigrants in Sweden, and 1,501 from Taiwan and 584 from Hong Kong. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/befolkning/befolkningens-sammansattning/befolkningsstatistik/pong/tabell-och-diagram/helarsstatistik--riket/folkmangd-efter-fodelseland/|title=Folkmängd efter födelseland 1900–2016|last=|first=|date=|website=SCB|publisher=[[Statistics Sweden]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure may even be higher as most of 17,727 [[Vietnamese boat people|Vietnamese that fled]] to Sweden during the [[Vietnam War]] are [[Hoa people|ethnic Chinese]] due to persecution by the new Communist government. These figures don't include the children of these immigrants born in Sweden. Including Chinese born in Sweden and the ethnic Chinese from Southeast Asia, the total number of Chinese in Sweden may be as much as 50,000–60,000.

The '''Daai'''  are an ethnic group living in [[Chin State]], [[Myanmar]]. The Daai consist of 32 Chin tribes, which have been registered by the [[Government of Burma]] since 1890. The recent [[State Peace and Development Council|Military Regime]]’s census mentions the Daai tribe as the 62nd of 135 tribes of Burma. Researchers refer to them as the Daai group in the ethnic survey book of Burma. The Daai Chin appear to be of [[Mongols|Mongolian]], [[Indochina|Indo-Chinese]], and [[Tibeto-Burman]] descent. The Daai people live in the [[Mindat Township|Mindat]], [[Paletwa]], [[Matupi, Myanmar|Matupi]] and [[Kanpetlet]] townships of Southern Chin State in Burma. There are more than 180 Daai villages with a total population of somewhere between 60,000 and 90,000. Their population makes the Daai-Chin the majority tribe of the Southern Chin Hills.

== Daai History==
The Daai land was an independent country until the [[British rule in Burma|British expedition in 1890]], and later annexation in 1897 by the [[United Kingdom]]. The Daai language varies slightly between sub tribes. Their ethnic tribal symbol is the ''khuum'' (rocket tail dragon). The ''ling leih'' (''[[Bulbophyllum refractum]]'', one of [[orchid]] species) is their royal flower. About 99% of Daai and Daai (Yindu) are Christians.

==Location==
[[File:Dailand Map.png|thumb|Dailand Map]]
The Daai Chin inhabit a part of the Southern [[Chin State]] of Myanmar, located on the mainland of [[Southeast Asia]]. It is surrounded by [[China]] to the north and northeast, [[Laos]] to the east, [[Thailand]] to the east and southeast, [[India]] to the northwest, [[Bangladesh]] to the west and the [[Andaman Sea]] to the south. The country is divided into four topographical zones. The Eastern [[Shan Plateau]] is a highland region that merges with the [[Dawna Range|Dawna]] and [[Tenasserim Yoma]] mountain ranges. The central belt zone covers the valleys of the [[Irrawaddy river|Irrawaddy]], [[Chindwin]] and [[Sittang]] rivers as well as a mountainous region to the north and a low lying delta to the south. The third region is the western mountain zone, also known as the [[Arakan Mountains]], a series of ridges that start in the northern mountain area and extend to the southwestern corner. The Arakan coastal zone is a narrow [[alluvial]] strip lying between the Arakan Mountains and the [[Bay of Bengal]].

The Daai land is situated in the southern part of the Chinland (Chin state) located on the western mountain zone of [[Myanmar]]. It is also located between north latitude 20˚ 42' and 21˚ 35', and between east longitude 93˚ 14' and 94˚ 8'. Daai land covers the west of [[Mindat Township]], the northwest of [[Kanpetlet]] township, the northeast of [[Paletwa]] township and to the southeast of the Matupi township. The longest part of their land is about 120&amp;nbsp;miles (193&amp;nbsp;km) and the narrowest part is roughly 60&amp;nbsp;miles (96&amp;nbsp;km). The Daai land is mountainous and situated between 800&amp;nbsp;m–3200&amp;nbsp;m above sea level. Daai Land has thousands of slope ranges of mountains, brooks, streams and a small river called the [[Lemro River]]. The biggest stream is Mone (မုန္းေခ်ာင္း). Many natural water courses flow through the mountain ranges running from north to south, forming valleys and gorges.

" The very word Daai is derived from the word thai/ Daai,   meaning peace, plain and harmony, and its root for adjective form is Do, Dam, and Daai, literally meaning plain or good for Do, valley or plain for Dam, and cool for Daai. Therefore we can note that the term Daai as plain though the present location is hilly and mountainous. A present the term Daai is a collective name, of the inhabitants of Daai land in the southern Chin state of Myanmar. According to Thang Hleih, the word Daai represents the people who live peacefully, gently lovingly, harmoniously, generously and kindly. The word, therefore, stands for the people who are living inside the most interior part of southern Chin State. 
The Daai appears to be from Mongoloid stock and from Tibeto-Burman family as the other Chin tribes. At present there are 175 Daai villages with a total population between 50000 and 60000.  They have their own particular traditional cultures, way of life, language, practices and traditional beliefs, and societies as other tribes in Myanmar. 

Daai people can be found in the west of Mindat township, the north - west of Kanpetlet township, the north - east of Paletwa township and the south - east of Matupi township, the southern part of the Chin state in Myanmar very close to Bangladesh and Northern India. The entire area is hilly made up of a series of ranges running from north to south which fortunately give sufficient food and rice to the inhabitants and their neighbors. The longest part of its land is about 120 miles (193 km) and the narrowest part is roughly 60 miles (96 km), and the area is far from each township between 60 miles and 90 miles. The Daai land is situated between 800ft to 3200 ft above the sea level." ***

==Population==
The overall Daai population is estimated somewhere between 60,000 and 90,000. 15% of the total population (500,000) of the Chin State are Daai people. Some of the Daai people live in and around Myanmar and all over the world. Daai people are descended from [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]], Tibeto - Burma, Kuki - Chin - [[Naga people|Naga]], [[Kuki peoples|Kuki]] - Chin, Chin - Daai.

==Politics==
Daai land is divided into four parts within the southern Chin state: Kanpetlet, Mindat, Matupi and Paletwa townships. Today Daai land encompasses Chin state, Myanmar. The local government separated Daai land into Kanpetlet Daai, Mindat Daai, Matu Daai and Paletwa Daai.

==Education==
There are only basic educational institutions, such as middle schools (students from 5 to 14 years of age) in Daai lands. Basic primary school is available in almost all villages. Higher education is available only in a few villages. Today, Daai,and Daai (Yindu) people are receiving further education in various Christian colleges such as in the capital cities of [[Yangon]], [[Falam]], [[Hakha]], [[Mandalay]], [[Kalay]], [[Maymyo]], [[ Kyaukhtu]], [[Pakokku]] .And also American , India, and some others country.

==Health==
There are government clinics and dispensaries in some villages, but there is no medicine in those dispensaries. People go to the nearest Burmese villages and the cities to buy medicine. There are no doctors in Daai land. Sometimes medical staff and nurses visit Daai lands. They occasionally administer government-provided vaccination to the Daai people.

==Culture==

===Language===
All Daai tribes speak the [http://www.ethnologue.com/language/dao Daai Chin] language, of the Sino-Tibetan family (not to be confused with the [[Daai language (disambiguation)|Daai language]], belonging to the Tai-Kadai family). There are slightly different styles between the subtribes of Kanpetlet township and Matupi township. Despite this, the different dialects are usually [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. Daai writing was developed in the 1990s with the help of German people, with an alphabet based on the [[German alphabet]].
Briefly, it should be concluded that the Daai alphabets, diphthongs are totally influenced by German alphabets because those days there are no educated persons ( it means that Daai peoople cannot speak English and English Grammar and Structure)who are a "YES" person. At those days (about 1980) no experience they have. What a  German lady said were followed by Daais who except Kheng Saw were uneducated persons, who got involved in Daai literature Committee were under Class 8 level. That is the reason that it should be like that it is a One-man-show.

Under the leadership of Daai Central Literature and Culture Committee,as Daais tried and try to be taught the Daai dialect to Daais in Southern Chin State at public primary schools, the Union Minister of Education recognized Daai dialect and permitted to print Grade one, two and three. Which text books are being taught in Mindat township, Kanpetlet township, Paletwa township, and, Matupi township which only faces difficulty to teach in public schools. 

Not least but least, all Daais must give them appreciation to them who devoted to spending time for Daai literature. They will be in Daais's minds and hearts even thought they are weak in education.

===Villages===
There are more than 180 villages in Daai land. Daai villages make up 13% of the 1,355 total villages in the Chin State. Villages range from 10 to 140 houses, the largest and most populated village in Daai land is Majar Innu Village in the Kanpetlet township, west of the central part of Daai land.

===Religion===
{{expand section|date=January 2011}}
Approximately thirty years ago, Daai people practised [[animism]]. Since then, most Daai people have converted to Christianity within the last two decades. Currently about 99% of the Daai people are Christian. Two hundred years ago, the first American Missionary, Adoniram Judson, went to Myanmar (Burma) and gave his life to the Lord reaching out to Myanmar (Burma). He positioned the lay ministers to lead the believers in Myanmar (Burma) after he died. That was in Rangoon (Yangon), the Capital City of Myanmar (Burma). They could not reach to the Daai area at that time because it was very far and for many other reasons. The gospel reached to the Daai area in around 1970 by other missionaries. That was 156 years after Judson's arrival in Myanmar (Burma).

===Shifting cultivation===
Daai people practise [[shifting cultivation]], known as ''''Taungya''" in Burmese and "''Lou''" in the Daai language. Cultivators cut and burn forests and raise agricultural crops for one to two years before moving on to another site, only returning to the original after 10 to 11 years.

The Daai people living in western part of Myanmar and southern part of Chin State have rich customs and traditions. Their traditions and rituals are associated with their shifting cultivation in the hills. The practice of shifting cultivation is deeply rooted in Daai culture. Shifting cultivation for the Daais is more than sustenance, it is a way of life, the foundation from which emerged their economic and social traditions.

In its early period, shifting cultivation provided food for the Daai. However, these days it serves as the economic mainstay for the Daai, providing money to buy clothes, attend school, and trade with their neighbours.

==Economy==
The Daai people cultivate rice, corn, millet, beans, peas, cucumber, pumpkin, gourd, egg plant, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, ginger, sesame and celery in their gardens or farms. Daai farmers cultivate at the beginning of [[monsoon season]] (the mid-April to June) and harvest crops in October and November. The cultivation method is dependent on monsoon rains.

Generally, Daai land is mostly used for [[slash-and-burn]] or shifting cultivation, with the least-developed regions inhabited by the indigenous hill tribes of Myanmar. Daai people earn their livelihood by shifting between cultivation (Taung Ya) and [[subsistence farming]]. Farming and gardening are only for their subsistence and personal consumption, transportation systems and markets are not developed in Daai land.

==Daai people in Malaysia==
Some Daai people migrate to [[Malaysia]] because their lives and political, cultural, and religious freedoms are threatened in Myanmar. There, the parents struggle for their daily bread as [[undocumented migrant]]s, vulnerable to arrest for immigration offences, and are often subject to detention, prosecution, whipping and deportation for several months.

Daai refugees in Malaysia originate from Myanmar, where current conditions do not permit them to return. Daai refugees are scattered throughout Malaysia in places such as [[Johor Baru]], [[Ipoh]], the [[Cameron Highlands]], [[Kalang]], [[Kajang]], [[Rawang, Selangor|Rawang]], and others.

There are no refugee camps in Malaysia. Instead, Daai refugees share living spaces in groups of up to 20 people, living in low-cost apartments, urban villages or housing estates near Malaysian homes. Many also live in makeshift camps in jungles near construction sites where they seek employment.

&lt;!--- ==History== ---&gt;
==Historic population data==
Hamburg was by far the most populated German City after the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamburg 1650 60,000 inhabitants, [[Demographics of Berlin|Berlin]] 1648: 6,000, [[Demographics of Cologne|Cologne]] 1714 (see German page): 42,015 and [[Population growth of Munich|Munich]] 1700: 24,000 in habitants&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its {{Interlanguage link multi|Hamburg Fortifications|de|3=Hamburger Wallanlagen|lt=fortifications|vertical-align=sup}}, which had been finished 1625, the city was never conquered and many people fled into it.

==Population==

On December 31, 2006 there were 1,754,182 registered people living in Hamburg (up from 1,652,363 in 1990).

==Sexual orientation==
{{further|Demographics of sexual orientation}}
The Hamburg Institute for Sexual Research conducted a survey over the sexual behavior of young people in 1970, and repeated it in 1990. Whereas in 1970 18% of the boys aged 16 and 17 reported to have had at least one same-sex sexual experience, the number had dropped to 2% by 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.lsbk.ch/articles/gunter_schmidt.asp |title=Gibt es Heterosexualität?

{{Demoscene}}
'''Demogroups''' are teams of '''demosceners''', who make computer based audio-visual works of art known as [[Demo (computer programming)|demos]]. Demogroups form a subculture collectively known as the [[demoscene]].

Groups frequently consist of students, young computer enthusiasts who spend days coding their demos. They often have a [[pseudonym]] (called a "[[screen name (computing)|handle]]" or "[[nickname|nick]]"), usually chained together with the name of their group (in formats like "Scener of Demo Group" or "Scener/DG"). Demosceners rarely use their real names in demoscene contexts. This is a tradition originating from the demoscene's roots, where small demos were distributed along with cracked software, usually computer games.

Many demogroups have been founded by friends who already knew each other in real life. However, there have also been groups that have taken their form online via [[Bulletin Board System]]s or the Internet. Perhaps the most important way for demogroups to communicate is [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]. Demosceners from different groups also meet each other in real life at [[demoparty|demoparties]] and smaller meetings.

Demogroups often bear resemblances to corporate companies: demogroups incorporate [[wordmark]]s, [[logo]]s, [[catchphrase]]s and [[slogan]]s for their promotion. It is very important for a demogroup to have good PR, and major groups have dedicated group organisers who are responsible for "managing the group's human resources", i.e. nag the members who slack off. Some groups also treat the recruitment of new members with great care, often applying "trial periods" in which the new member has to prove himself to be worthy. However these practices are often just intentional exaggeration (often [[tongue-in-cheek]]), to maintain an "elite" image for the group.

A group is perhaps the most important [[social unit]] in the demoscene, and belonging to a group is often considered more or less synonymous to being a demoscener. Even individual productions, with no group activity involved, are typically associated with the group of the creative individual. There have even been several "one-man groups" when an individual demomaker with no group has wanted to release a demo or intro.

==Demography==
The countries with the most active demogroups and [[demoparty|demoparties]] are currently the [[Nordic countries]] ([[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]] and [[Denmark]]), [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Hungary]] and [[France]].

Due to the community-like nature of the demoscene, multi-national demogroups are not uncommon.

==Demoscener functions==
Demosceners specialize themselves into various categories to be able to take part in the demomaking process. A few people are able to cross over between multiple archetypes (e.g. coder-musician, musician-designer), but this is by no means a trend.

The coder is the demogroup's programmer who creates the demo's software framework and is responsible for the actual realtime state of the demo. While some coders specialize in developing system-level functionality (such as providing wrappers and [[application programming interface|API]]s for other coders to base their code on), others code effects which are usually visual representations of mathematical formulas, such as [[fractal]]s or [[metaballs]].

In the 1990s, coders were most often entirely responsible for the demo's flow and arrangement, including the effect's synchronization to the music and sometimes even the design. Nowadays, software tools known as ''demotools'' are widely used, allowing this work to be done by a designer who does not have to be a coder. Many groups, however, still prefer that the coder takes most of the responsibility in the demomaking process, including the design.

In many cases, an attempt for excelling in several areas has resulted in one area outshadowing the others: for instance, coders who try to make music often come up with "coder music" which may be technically passable but lacks artistic ambitions. "Coder graphics" and "coder palettes" are similar terms for graphics and color schemes.

===Graphic artist===
Graphic artists (or ''graphicians'' in scene [[Jargon|lingo]]) create the visual coherency behind a demo, which include still pictures, design elements, fonts, colors, 3D objects, textures and animation.

Originally, there was a single type of graphician creating typical 2D graphics (referred to as pixeled graphics because they were typically created pixel by pixel). Ever since demos started using complex (as in, much more elaborate than cubes and donuts) 3D graphics, graphicians that exclusively model 3D graphics are also around, sometimes referred to as (3D) modelers.

===Musicians===
Musicians are responsible for the composing, arranging, mixing and mastering (and in some cases, performing) the soundtracks and sound effects in the demo.

In the older days, musicians worked with [[Tracker (music software)|tracker]]s, and the world of tracked music was heavily dominated by demoscene musicians. In later times, it became possible for the PC demos to use streaming, high-quality music formats, and the musicians started to gradually change their tools to professional [[music sequencer]]s. However, tracked music and other specialized formats still continue to be used in size-restricted intros as well as demos written for more restrictive platforms such as mobile devices and vintage computers.

==Fake groups==
Demosceners often form fake groups, which are essentially [[secret identity|secret identities]] for making humorous or vulgar productions without scathing their original reputation - people in a fake group hide behind a [[pseudonym]] (which, considering their demoscene handles, usually becomes a pseudo-pseudonym). This type of masquerading is often just performed to confuse naïve newcomers to the scene; while some fake identities are never revealed for their time of activity, in most cases a large portion of unrelated people are aware of the real persons behind the spoof.

=="One-man" groups==
Though they are not strictly "demogroups" by definition, the scene always had various individuals who excelled in all areas of demomaking; rather than gathering various other persons to aid them in a creative process, they do all of the programming, music making and visual art themselves. While the obvious disadvantage of this type of working is the multiple of amount of work one must do with a given quality standard, one-man groups usually point out that having no others to work with gets rid of discussions and creative differences alike, and is actually a very free way of working.

One-man groups are usually treated with a mix of respect and curiosity within the scene, because they're not an extremely common phenomenon, and some of the scene marks them as an unnecessary effort for virtuosity, largely because it is virtually impossible to perform above average in all areas - one-man demos and intros usually bear obvious lacks in given areas, depending on whether the creator was more a coder, graphician or musician, who adapted other skillsets later.

Perhaps the most successful one-man army of the demoscene is [http://and.intercon.ru/index.php?id=about Dmitry "AND" Andreev], two-time winner of the [[Assembly (demo party)|Assembly demo party]] in the [[64k Intro|64k intro]] category.

'''Rahma el-Dennaoui''' (born April 19, 2004) is a [[Lebanese Australian]] girl who went missing on 10 November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mybabyname.net/both/Dennaoui|title=Dennaoui - Meaning And Origin Of The Baby Name Dennaoui {{!}} MYBABYNAME.NET|website=www.mybabyname.net|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She was last seen in the bedroom of her home in [[Lurnea, New South Wales|Lurnea]], [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]], early that morning, where the 19-month-old girl and her siblings slept. Despite a police search and appeals to the general public, no trace of the little girl has yet been found.&lt;ref name="Sister"&gt;{{Cite news

==Background==
Rahma was born to Hosayn El-Dennaoui, a migrant from [[Iaal]], Lebanon, and Alyaa, from the nearby village of Dayranbouh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Greg Bearup|title=Little girl lost|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/little-girl-lost/story-e6frg8h6-1226531151620|accessdate=16 July 2016|work=THE AUSTRALIAN|date=8 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC radio" /&gt; Rahma was between two of her sisters on a double bed under the window. She had trouble sleeping in the heat and her father got up and went to check on her at 2 am. When he returned at 8 am, she was gone.&lt;ref name="ABC radio"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rahma had not been walking long, and it is nearly a kilometre from the el-Dennaoui home to any bushland, making a toddler's journey there unlikely. There was a rip in the fly-screen covering the window above her bed, and this opening was large enough for Rahma to fit through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Reward==
In May 2007, ''[[New Idea]]'' magazine offered a $20,000 (AUS) reward for information on what happened to Rahma. The magazine's editor-in-chief Robyn Foster says it was the similarities between Rahma and the highly publicised case of [[Madeleine McCann]] that sparked her interest in the case.&lt;ref name="Stranger"&gt;{{cite web

'''Dâw''' is a [[Nadahup languages|Nadahup language]] spoken by about one hundred [[Dâw]] people in the northwestern part of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], [[Brazil]], in an area commonly known as [[Alto Rio Negro]]. Most Dâw also speak [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name="martins2004_1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martins|2004|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martins|2005|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=A Grammar of Hup|year=2008|last1=Epps|first1=Patience|authorlink=Patience L Epps|page=4|location=[[Berlin]], [[Germany]]|publisher=[[Mouton de Gruyter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extinct variety, ''Kurikuria(r)í'', named after the [[Curicuriari River]], was a distinct language sociolinguistically, but at least partially intelligible with Dâw.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Dâw has 15 [[vowels]]:&lt;ref name="martins2004_55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Martins|2004|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="IPA wikitable"
|- align=center
! rowspan="2" |
! [[Front vowel|Front]]

! colspan="2" | [[Back vowel|Back]]
|- align=center

|}

Vowels are [[laryngealisation|laryngealized]] when occurring beside a [[glottal stop]], as seen in the examples below.&lt;ref name="martins2005_52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Martins|2005|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{IPA|/ʔɛʔ/ [ʔɛ̰́ʔ]}} ''"large mouth"''
: {{IPA|/nɯʔ/ [nɯ̰́ʔ]}} ''"to lack"''

==== Vowel harmony ====
[[Vowel harmony]] in Dâw is seen primarily in two situations: in [[compound (linguistics)|compounding]] and with the focus marker {{IPA|/-''V''ʔ/}}, where ''V'' indicates a vowel. When combining two words with the first word having the syllable structure CVC, vowel harmony is not seen, e.g. {{IPA|/pɔx/}} ''"high"'' + {{IPA|/lã̌ʃ/}} ''"boat"'' = {{IPA|/pɔxlã̌ʃ/}} ''"airplane"''. However, when combining two words with the first word having the syllable structure CV, vowel harmony is seen, e.g. {{IPA|/xɔ̂/}} ''"canoe"'' + {{IPA|/tɯm/}} ''"eye"'' = {{IPA|/xɯtɯm/}} ''"sun"''. The vowel of the focus marker {{IPA|/-''V''ʔ/}} is the same as the vowel of the syllable it is appended to, e.g. {{IPA|/jɯ̂w/}} ''"blood"'' + {{IPA|/-''V''ʔ/}} = {{IPA|/jɯ̂wɯʔ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martins|2005|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consonants ===
Dâw has 25 [[consonant]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martins|2004|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="IPA wikitable"
|- align="center"
! colspan="2" | 
! [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]
! [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]
! [[Postalveolar consonant|Postalveolar]]

| 
|- align="center"
! colspan="2" | [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]
| 
| 
| ʃ

|- align="center"
! rowspan="2" | [[Nasal stop|Nasal]]
! &lt;small&gt;Plain&lt;/small&gt;

| 
|- align="center"
! &lt;small&gt;[[Glottalization|Glottalized]]&lt;/small&gt;
| 
| lˀ
| 
| jˀ
| wˀ
| 
|}

Glottalized consonants are also [[laryngealisation|laryngealized]], as seen in the examples below.&lt;ref name="martins2005_52" /&gt;

: {{IPA|/wˀac/ [w̰ˀác̚]}} ''"oar"''
: {{IPA|/ʃělˀ/ [ʃěːl̰ˀ̚]}} ''"banana"''

The [[plosive consonant]]s have [[no audible release]] as [[syllable coda|codas]], e.g. {{IPA|/pɤp/}} ''"to kick"'' is realized as {{IPA|[pɤp̚]}}, and {{IPA|/kɤɟ/}} ''"to scratch with the nail"'' as {{IPA|[kʼɤc̚]}}. When being onsets, {{IPA|/c/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are realized as [[ejective consonant]]s, i.e. {{IPA|[cʼ]}} and {{IPA|[kʼ]}}, unlike the other plosive consonants, which are realized simply as plain consonants, e.g. {{IPA|[cʼóc̚]}} ''"without hair"'', {{IPA|[kʼɛ̃́k̚]}} ''"to hook"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martins|2004|pp=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martins|2005|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stress ===
[[stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is fixed in Dâw, occurring on the last syllable of a word. A few [[suffix]]es in Dâw do not take the stress, however. The suffixes are divided into two groups, metric suffixes and extrametric suffixes. The former follows the general rule of stress on the last syllable, while the latter does not. See the examples below, where {{IPA|/-ɔh/}} is a metric suffix, and {{IPA|/-ĩh/}} an extrametric suffix.&lt;ref name="martins2005_46-48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Martins|2005|pp=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{IPA|[bɤ̀ˈjɤ̂ː]}} ''"to return"''
: {{IPA|[bɤ̀jɤ̂ːˈɔ́h]}} ''"return!"''
: {{IPA|[bɤ̀ˈjɤ̂ːĩ̀h]}} ''"is returning"''

=== Tone ===
In Dâw there are either three or four [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], depending on analysis. There are a low tone, a high tone, a rising tone and a falling tone, marked by a [[grave accent]], an [[acute accent]], a [[caron]] and [[circumflex]], respectively, but only the two latter are lexical. The low tone only occurs on syllables without stress, while the high tone only occurs on syllables with stress, and the rising and falling tones may occur on all syllables. As the low and high tones are not lexical, they are often left unmarked, as in {{IPA|/tɤɡ/}} ''"tooth"'', which really is realized as {{IPA|[tɤ́ɡ̚]}}.&lt;ref name="martins2005_46-48" /&gt;

Besides the lexical function of tone, tone may also function [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] and [[syntax|syntactically]]. Consider the examples below, the first being morphological and the second being syntactical, showing how tone is used in a [[derivation (linguistics)|derivative manner]] and how tone is used to differentiate [[intransitive verb|intransitive]] from [[transitive verb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martins|2005|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{IPA|[wɛ̂d̚]}} ''"to eat"''
: {{IPA|[wɛ̌d̚]}} ''"food"''

: {{IPA|[cʼɔ́ᵇm]}} ''"to bathe (oneself)"''
: {{IPA|[cʼɔ̂ːᵇm]}} ''"to bathe (someone)"''

[[Vowel length]] is predictable and present in Dâw, yet not distinctive lexically. All vowels with a rising or falling tone are long, while all vowels without a tone are short.&lt;ref name="martins2004_55" /&gt;

'''Formatted text''', '''styled text,''' or '''rich text''', as opposed to [[plain text]], has styling information beyond the minimum of semantic elements: colours, styles (boldface, italic), sizes, and special features in HTML (such as [[hyperlink]]s).

==Terminology==

Formatted text cannot rightly be identified with binary files or be distinct from ASCII text. This is because formatted text is not necessarily binary, it may be text-only, such as [[HTML]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]] or [[enriched text]] files, and it may be ASCII-only. Conversely, a [[plain text]] file may be non-ASCII (in an encoding such as [[Unicode]] [[UTF-8]]).{{explain|Both ASCII and UTF-8, which is a superset thereof, can be used for plain text and for formatted text.|date=September 2018}} Text-only formatted text is achieved by [[Markup language|markup]] which too is textual, while some editors of formatted text like [[Microsoft Word]] save in a binary format.

==Beginnings of formatted text==

Formatted text has its genesis in the pre-computer use of underscoring to embolden passages in typewritten [[manuscript (publishing)|manuscripts]]. In the first interactive systems of early computer technology, underscoring was not possible, and users made up for this lack (and the lack of formatting in ASCII) by using certain symbols as substitutes. Emphasis, for example, could be achieved in ASCII in a number of ways:

* Capitalization: &lt;tt&gt;I am NOT making this up.&lt;/tt&gt;
* Surrounding with underscores: &lt;tt&gt;I am _not_ making this up.&lt;/tt&gt;
* Surrounding with asterisks: &lt;tt&gt;I am *not* making this up.&lt;/tt&gt;
* Spacing: &lt;tt&gt;I am n o t making this up.&lt;/tt&gt;

Surrounding by underscores was also used for book titles: &lt;tt&gt;Look it up in _The_C_Programming_Language_.&lt;/tt&gt;

==Markup languages==
{{Main article|Markup languages}}

Formatting can be marked by tags distinguished from the body text by special characters, such as angle brackets in [[HTML]]. For example, this text:

:The dog is classified as ''Canis lupus familiaris'' in taxonomy.

is marked up in [[HTML]] thus:
&lt;source lang="html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dog is classified as &lt;i&gt;Canis lupus familiaris&lt;/i&gt; in taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
The italicised text is enclosed by an opening and a closing italics tag. In [[LaTeX]], the text would be marked up like this:
&lt;source lang="latex"&gt;
 The dog is classified as \textit{Canis lupus familiaris} in taxonomy.
&lt;/source&gt;
Markup languages can be implemented with any [[text editor]], needing no special [[software]].

==Formatted document files==

Since the invention of [[MacWrite]], the first [[WYSIWYG]] word processor, in which the typist codes the formatting visually rather than by inserting textual markup, word processors have tended to save to [[binary files]]. Opening such files with a [[text editor]] reveals the text embellished with various binary characters, either around the formatted areas (e.g. in [[WordPerfect]]) or separately, at the beginning or end of the file (e.g. in [[Microsoft Word]]).

Formatted text documents in binary files have, however, the disadvantages of formatting scope and secrecy. Whereas the extent of formatting is accurately marked in markup languages, [[WYSIWYG]] formatting is based on memory, that is, keeping for example your pressing of the boldface button until cancelled. This can lead to formatting mistakes and maintenance troubles. As for secrecy, formatted text document file formats tend to be proprietary and undocumented, leading to difficulty in coding compatibility by third parties, and also to unnecessary upgrades because of version changes.

[[WordStar]] was a popular word processor that did not use binary files with hidden characters.

[[OpenOffice.org]] Writer saves files in an [[XML]] format. However, the resultant file is a binary since it is compressed (a [[tar (file format)|tar]]ball equivalent).

[[portable document format|PDF]] is another formatted text file format that is usually binary (using compression for the text, and storing graphics and fonts in binary). It is generally an end-user format, written from an application such as [[Microsoft Word]] or [[OpenOffice.org]] Writer, and not editable by the user once done.

&lt;!-- All this is pretty much bogus, I think.
I agree. It contains naïve information. Text encoding ≠ Text formatting.

as a [[sequence]] of [[code]]s (from a [[character encoding]]) for the purpose of [[computer storage]] or electronic [[communication]] of that text. While character encodings like [[ASCII]] represent individual [[character (computing)|characters]] of a [[language]], a text encoding has to represent much larger things like [[article]]s and [[book]]s, and must represent not only the characters they contain but the [[structure]] and [[organization]] of the text, and perhaps [[information]] about the text or its [[appearance]]. Common examples are [[HTML]] and [[RTF]] which represent texts in [[natural language]]s, and [[XML]], which can represent many kinds of text not necessarily intended to be human-readable (the contents of a [[database]], for example).

In general there are two basic forms of text encoding that are widely used. One is to use a [[markup language]] which adds markers to the text itself. Markup has the advantage of being easy to represent, but has the disadvantage of being hard to view without an "aware" [[reader application]]. For instance, if an HTML document is opened in a [[text editor]], it is largely readable, but the text is cluttered with codes, and even more so in the case of a table, and there are character references for special characters which may make parts unreadable, at least to those unfamiliar with the format. Another method is to use "[[pointer]]s" into the text, which is left in the original format. This has the advantage of allowing the [[content]] to be easily readable in any [[editor]], although you lose the "[[styling]]". On the downside, editing such a [[document]] in a non-aware application typically leaves the pointers pointing to the wrong [[data]]. Today the majority of text encoding systems appear to use markup, although whether by choice or simply because "everyone else does" is open to question.

Though character encodings like [[ASCII]] and [[Unicode]] are not, strictly speaking, text encodings in their own right, they may serve as very simple text encodings if one wishes only to preserve the English [[content]] of a document and not necessarily its [[formatting]]. By far the most common text encoding now in use is what might informally be called "Plain ASCII", which involves simply encoding a text as a [[stream]] of ASCII characters. The specifics of how this is done vary greatly: for example, the end of a [[text line]] might be encoded as ASCII code 10 ("[[line feed]]" or "new line") as is common practice on [[Unix]] machines, or as ASCII code 13 ("[[carriage return]]") as is common on [[Apple computer|Apple]] machines, or as both (the sequence &lt;13, 10&gt; is used to end lines on [[DOS]] based machines and many others, while the rather rare sequence &lt;10, 13&gt; was used by some [[Acorn Computers Ltd|Acorn]] machines). Some texts also use this line-end sequence inside [[paragraph]]s (with a blank line between paragraphs) while some do not.  Also, various texts in this form interpret code 9 ("tab") and other [[control character]]s differently.  None of these methods specify how to identify text structure like [[heading]]s and [[table]]s, or special text forms like [[italics]]. Text in this format is basically readable by any [[computer]] though some work might be needed to accommodate local variations, and all information besides the actual [[word]]s of the text will be lost.

[[File:Juan Mann.jpg|thumb|Juan Mann, who started the Free Hugs movement, seen at [[Pitt Street Mall]], Sydney, Australia, 2006]]

The '''Free Hugs Campaign''' is a social movement involving individuals who offer [[hug]]s to strangers in public places.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;Ellen Connolly [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/11/05/1099547388492.html Hugs and smiles, but not everyone embraces the trend] ''Sydney Morning Herald'', December 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The hugs are meant to be [[random acts of kindness]]—selfless acts performed just to make others feel better. International Free Hugs Month is celebrated on the first Saturday of July and continues until August first.

The campaign in its present form was started in 2004 by an [[Australia]]n man known only by the pseudonym "Juan Mann".&lt;ref name="Spreading the Love: Juan Mann"&gt;WHO Magazine Interview [http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/b/who-magazine/115/spreading-the-love-juan-mann Spreading the Love: Juan Mann] December 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign became famous internationally in 2006 as the result of a [[music video]] on [[YouTube]] by the Australian band [[Sick Puppies]], which has been viewed over 78 million times as of April 16, 2018.

== History ==
The Free Hugs campaign in its present form was started by Juan Mann on June 30, 2004, when he began giving out hugs in the Pitt Street Mall in central [[Sydney]]. In the months prior to this, Mann had been feeling depressed and lonely as a result of numerous personal difficulties. However, a random hug from a stranger made an enormous difference, with Mann stating that "...I went out to a party one night and a completely random person came up to me and gave me a hug. I felt like a king! It was greatest thing that ever happened."

Mann carried the now iconic "FREE HUGS" sign from the outset. However, on his first attempt in his hometown, where he returned to find that he was the only person he knew, as his friends and family had moved away, he had to wait fifteen minutes before an elderly lady came up to him and gave him a hug.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/slideshow/oprahshow/oprahshow1_ss_20061030 The Gift of Giving Back] ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Freehugs sydney2004.jpg|thumb|upright|A person holding up a "Free Hugs" sign in Sydney, Australia, in 2004]]
Initial distrust of Juan Mann's motives eventually gave way to a gradual increase of people willing to be hugged, with other huggers (male and female) helping distribute them. In October 2005 [[police]] told them they must stop, as Mann had not obtained [[liability insurance|public liability insurance]] worth $25 million for his actions. Mann and his companions used a [[petition]] to attempt to convince authorities that his campaign should be allowed to continue without the insurance. His petition reached 10,000 signatures. He submitted it and was allowed to continue giving free hugs.&lt;ref name="au.lifestyle.yahoo.com"&gt;Who Magazine [http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/b/whomagazine/121/spreading-the-love-shimon-moore Spreading the Love: Shimon Moore (Sick Puppies)] January 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Mann befriended Shimon Moore, lead singer for [[Sick Puppies]], shortly after commencing his campaign, and over a two-month period in late 2005 Moore recorded video footage of Mann and his fellow huggers. Moore and his band moved to [[Los Angeles]] in March 2005 and nothing was immediately done with the footage. Meanwhile, Mann continued his campaign throughout 2005 and 2006 by appearing in Pitt Street Mall in Sydney most Thursday afternoons.

In mid-2006 Mann's grandmother died, and in consolation Moore made the music video using the footage he had shot in 2004 to send to Mann as a gift, stating in an interview that, "I sent it to him on a disc as a present and I wrote down 'This is who you are'."&lt;ref name="au.lifestyle.yahoo.com"/&gt; The video was later uploaded onto YouTube, where it has been viewed 74 million times as of October 2013.&lt;ref name="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr3x_RRJdd4"&gt;Free Hugs Campaign - Official Page (music by Sick Puppies.net )&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2006, Mann was invited by [[Oprah Winfrey]] to appear on her show ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' after her producer's doctor saw the Free Hugs video on YouTube. Juan Mann made an appearance outside her studio that morning, offering free hugs to the crowd waiting to see the taping of that day's episode. Oprah's camera crews caught several people in the audience hugging Mann as the morning progressed.&lt;ref name="oprah"&gt;Oprah.com [http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200610/20061030/slide_20061030_284_101.jhtml Juan Mann on Oprah] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201025749/http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200610/20061030/slide_20061030_284_101.jhtml |date=December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 2007, Juan Mann announced his residential address online and offered an open invitation to anyone to come over and chat on-camera as part of his 'open-house project'. Mann hosted 80 guests over 36 days. On November 25, 2007, Mann's landlord threatened him with eviction, so he launched an online appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Ramadge, [http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,22821775-5014108,00.html Free Hugs star a 'security risk'] ''NEWS.com.au''&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 25, 2007, Juan Mann published an [[e-book]] as a free download. On November 22, 2008, at [[YouTube Live]] Sick Puppies did a performance of "All the Same" while Juan Mann gave hugs to crowd members. On February 13, 2009 a Free Hug Day took place.

Free hugs signs were also commonly seen at [[Phish]] shows at least as early as 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&amp;dat=19960818&amp;id=979KAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hOkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1215%2C4099799 The Daily Gazette - Aug 18, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

A website that is generally recognized{{cn|date=September 2018}} as the official site of the free hugs campaign, The Official Home of the Free Hugs Campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freehugscampaign.org/|title=Official Home of the Free Hugs Campaign - Inspired by Juan Mann - Home|work=freehugscampaign.org|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in mid-2007. This site enables those involved in the campaign to better organize themselves and coordinate their efforts. Many initiatives resulted from these efforts. For example, on the website's forum (hosted on Dragon Arts),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dragonarts.us/forum&lt;/ref&gt; those involved in the campaign called for an annual International Free Hugs Day. Mann declared that the day would fall on the first Saturday following June 30 each year; this being the first date that Mann ever offered free hugs in Pitt Street Mall, Sydney in 2004. The first International Free Hugs Day was July 7, 2007, the second on July 5, 2008, and the third was on July 4, 2009. (See above regarding [[Valentine's Day]]).

Mann's Official Blog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juanmann.com/|title=Juan Mann - True Home of the Free Hugs Campaign|work=juanmann.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; remained dormant after his apparent retirement but has been updated at times; it proclaims itself as the "true home" of the Free Hugs Campaign and hosts interviews conducted with individuals holding Free Hugs Campaigns internationally.


In [[Riyadh]], Saudi Arabia, two men were arrested by the [[Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice]] for offering free hugs in a public space. The move was criticized on [[Twitter]], however others opposed the campaign altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/11/saudi-police-arrest-two-over-free-hugs-20131121164035187159.html|title=Saudi police arrest two over 'free hugs'|work=aljazeera.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most remarkable of these international events was the group's support in [[Conchita Wurst]]'s [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014]] campaign, in which the group opened their arms to embrace the message of tolerance through 'free hugs'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://eurovisiontimes.wordpress.com/2014/05/03/austria-free-hugs-in-the-press-centre/ | location=Austria | work=The Eurovision Times | title=Free Hugs in the Press Centre! | date=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://escaustria.at/page/2 | location=Austria | work=ESC Austria | title=#freehugs for everybody, spread tolerance #eurovisionsongcontest2014 | date=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://oikotimes.com/2014/05/08/may-08-conchitas-boy-giving-free-hugs/ | location=Austria | work=OIKO Times | title=CONCHITA’S BOY GIVING FREE HUGS | date=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/26159 | location=Austria | work=Jüdische Allgemeine | title=»Drück mich!« | date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.readersdigest.co.in/story/the-power-of-touch/1/124322.html | location=Austria | work=Reader's Digest | title=The Power of Touch | date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In May 2015, 2016 and 2017, members of the “Free Hugs Vienna” team were active during the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] week in [[Vienna]] (2015),  [[Stockholm]] (2016) and [[Kiev]] (2017). Aligning with the event's motto “Building Bridges” (2015), "Come Together" (2016) and "Celebrate Diversity" (2017), the “free huggers” connected with members of the international press, fans and other guests in the Eurovision Press Center, Euro Fan Café and in front of the Eurovision arena on the days of the semi finals and final. 2017 is the fourth year in a row that "Free Hugs Vienna" is active in the ESC context upon invitation from the Austrian broadcaster, [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]].

'''Fuzhou Tanka''' ([[Fuzhou dialect]]: 曲蹄; [[Foochow Romanized]]: '''Kuóh-dà̤'''; [[Simplified Chinese]]: '''福州疍民''' Hók-ciŭ Dáng-mìng; 江妹仔 Gĕ̤ng-muói-giāng; 曲蹄婆 Kuóh-dà̤-bò̤), or '''Fuzhou Boat People''', is an [[ethnic group]] in [[Fujian]], [[China]]. A branch of the [[Tanka people]], they traditionally lived on [[sampans]] in the [[lower course]] of [[Min River (Fujian)|Min River]] and the coast of [[Fuzhou]] in [[Fujian Province]] most of their lives and have been officially recognized as [[Han Chinese]] since 1955.&lt;ref name="Origin and Migration of Mindong's Fishermen (闽东疍民的由来及历史变迁)"&gt;Jian-min Li (李健民), [http://bbs.artx.cn/thread-19585-1-1.html Origin and Migration of Mindong's Fishermen (闽东疍民的由来及历史变迁)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129042013/http://bbs.artx.cn/thread-19585-1-1.html |date=2010-01-29 }}, Journal of Ningde Teachers' College, 2009 Vol. 2, pp.38–44 (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and etymology==
[[File:Inner River of Fuzhou.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The boats of Fuzhou Tanka on an inner river in Fuzhou, circa late 19th to early 20th century.]]
There are several different views on the origin of Fuzhou Tanka. The mainstream theory believes that Fuzhou Tanka are descendants of the [[Baiyue]] of ancient times.&lt;ref name="Origin and Migration of Mindong's Fishermen (闽东疍民的由来及历史变迁)"/&gt; As a branch of the Tanka people, Fuzhou Tanka has been in [[Northern and southern China|South China]] for more than 2000 years.&lt;ref name="闽江流域疍民的文化习俗形态"&gt;刘传标,[http://fass.net.cn/fassNews/fass_readnews.asp?NewsID=1933 闽江流域疍民的文化习俗形态]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[Fuzhou dialect|Fuzhounese]] name "Kuóh-dà̤" ([[wikt:曲|曲]][[wikt:蹄|蹄]]) is a derogatory term used by the [[Fuzhou people]] on land, which can be literally translated into "[[bowlegged]]" and might come from the bow shape of their legs caused by longtime living in the low cabins of their boats.&lt;ref name="Local Annals of Min County (闽县乡土志)"&gt;Local Annals of Min County (闽县乡土志) (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="福州疍民调查"&gt;吴高梓：福州疍民调查[J]，社会学界（第四卷），1930 (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amoy University anthropologist Ling Hui-hsiang wrote on his theory of the Fujian Tanka being descendants of the Baiyue. He claimed that Guangdong and Fujian Tanka are definitely descended from the old Pai Yue peoples, and that they may have been ancestors of the [[Malay race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Murray A. Rubinstein |editor=Murray A. Rubinstein |title=Taiwan: a new history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHqMJSM6dAYC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=tanka+tribes+aboriginal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jgs2TsX-N821twft-9GSDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=tanka%20tribes%20aboriginal&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-10-29 |type= |edition=illustrated |series= |volume= |date= |year=2007 |month= |origyear= |publisher=M.E.

Might some of them have left the Yueh tribes and set out on the seas? (1936: 117) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Fuzhou Tanka now speak the [[Fuzhou dialect]], which is widely used by the majority Fuzhou people in this region. [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] has also been brought to many of them through national [[compulsory education]]. However, they had their own language in history, but gradually abandoned it. In [[Ming Dynasty]], many of them were already able to speak the Fuzhou dialect or other [[Eastern Min language]]s.&lt;ref name="《闽台民族史辨》"&gt;郭志超, 《闽台民族史辨》, 黄山书社, 2006年 (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==
[[File:Hockchew Tanka distribution.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Distribution of the Fuzhou Tanka people in [[China]].]]
Traditionally, Fuzhou Tanka people lived on boats in most of their lives. They were severely discriminated by land living Fuzhounese residents. Their life depended on [[fishing]] and ferrying, and most of them remained poor and uneducated before the founding of [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. Fuzhou Tanka people had a rich tradition of [[folk music]], especially [[call and response]]. They also had different views on [[chastity]] and [[remarriage]] from the land living Han Chinese. [[Pre-marital sex]] and [[remarriage]] were not restricted in their society. Due to the discriminatory policy imposed by the land living Han majority, Fuzhou Tanka were forced to dress themselves in a humble way to show their inferiority to the land residents.&lt;ref name="福州疍民调查"/&gt;

By the second half of the 19th century, many Tanka people had already been converted to [[Roman Catholic]]ism. Some of these Catholic Tanka consequently moved onto land under the protection of Catholic Church. In the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] era, the ethnic [[egalitarianism]] was guaranteed by law. Since the 1950s, the [[Communist Party of China|Communist government]] began to resettle Fuzhou Tanka to land dwellings. As a result, many Fuzhou Tanka villages were built along the Min River and the coast. Nowadays, most Fuzhou Tanka people have abandoned their traditional waterborne lives and intermarriage is common. Their traditions, such as Fuzhou Tanka [[folk music]], are under threat as well.&lt;ref name="Origin and Migration of Mindong's Fishermen (闽东疍民的由来及历史变迁)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="County Annals of Luoyuan (罗源县志)"&gt;County Annals of Luoyuan (罗源县志)，Fangzhi Publishing House，1998.11，{{ISBN|7-80122-390-X}} (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Endangered Fuzhou Tanka Folk Music (濒临失传的“福州疍民渔歌”)"&gt;[http://www.fzda.gov.cn/tslmshow.asp?id=6049 The Endangered Fuzhou Tanka Folk Music (濒临失传的“福州疍民渔歌”)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201002634/http://www.fzda.gov.cn/tslmshow.asp?id=6049 |date=2009-12-01 }} (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination against Fuzhou Tanka==
[[File:Fuzhou Tanka Land-dwelling 1.jpg|thumb|right|Tanka land dwellings built in the mid 20th century in [[Luoyuan County]], Fuzhou, China.]]
Before the founding of [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], the Fuzhou Tanka were generally treated by land Chinese residents as mean and inferior. They were not allowed to dwell on land, receive education, wear [[silk]] clothes or work in government or army. In some areas, they were even forbidden to walk on land, otherwise, they would be faced with death threats. Since the 18th century several attempts had been made by the [[Qing]] and [[Kuomintang]] governments to lift the discrimination against Tanka people, but it was only in the [[People's Republic of China]] era that all the discriminatory policies were completely eliminated.&lt;ref name="福州疍民调查"/&gt;&lt;ref name="County Annals of Luoyuan (罗源县志)"/&gt; Before the founding of the People's Republic of China, the ‘gypsies of the sea’ were not allowed to go ashore or marry the people living along the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= China's Tanka boat people floating homes|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2451023/Chinas-Tanka-boat-peoples-floating-homes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Before the 19th century, many Fuzhou Tanka practiced [[Taoism]], worshiping [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]], [[Linshui (goddess)|Linshui]] and other gods and goddesses. In the late 19th century, many Fuzhou Tanka people were converted to [[Roman Catholic]]. Received, protected and assisted by the Roman Catholic Church in Fuzhou through [[Protectorate of missions]], some of them were able to build simple land dwellings. Currently, the majority of Fuzhou Tanka people are Roman Catholic, which constitute a significant portion in [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Fuzhou]].&lt;ref name="Researching into the Belief of Boatmen in Fujian in Modern Time"&gt;Fan Zhengyi, Researching into the Belief of Boatmen in Fujian in Modern Time, Journal of Putian University, 2005 12(6) (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surnames==
The Fuzhou Tanka have different surnames than the Tanka of Guangdong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Anders Hansson |title=Chinese outcasts: discrimination and emancipation in late imperial China |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=the+name+hoklo+is+used+by+the+hoklo,+but+the+tanka+will+not+used+the+name+tanka+which+they+consider+using+instead&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-W6wTueyK6220AHyveW1AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-11-04 |type= |edition= |series= |volume=Volume 37 of Sinica Leidensia |date= |year=1996 |month= |origyear= |publisher=BRILL |location= |language= |isbn=90-04-10596-4 |page=117 |pages= |at= |chapter= |quote=Unless a change of surnames occurred for some unknown reason, or unless the ' water names' are not the real names of the Fujian boat people, it would seem that the Dan people lacked Chinese-style surnames at the time the Fujian branch }}&lt;/ref&gt; Qing records indicate that "Weng, Ou, Chi, Pu, Jiang, and Hai" (翁, 歐, 池, 浦, 江) were surnames of the Fuzhou Tanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Anders Hansson |title=Chinese outcasts: discrimination and emancipation in late imperial China |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=An+Imperial+decision+in+1729+stated+that+Cantonese+people+regard+the+Dan+households+as+being+of+the+mean+class+and+do+not+allow+them+to+settle+on+shore.+The+Dan+households,+for+their+part,+dare+not+struggle+with+the+common+people.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=e0e0TqLSLdDSgQeto5ntAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20Imperial%20decision%20in%201729%20stated%20that%20Cantonese%20people%20regard%20the%20Dan%20households%20as%20being%20of%20the%20mean%20class%20and%20do%20not%20allow%20them%20to%20settle%20on%20shore.%20The%20Dan%20households%2C%20for%20their%20part%2C%20dare%20not%20struggle%20with%20the%20common%20people.&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-11-04 |type= |edition= |series= |volume=Volume 37 of Sinica Leidensia |date= |year=1996 |month= |origyear= |publisher=BRILL |location= |language= |isbn=90-04-10596-4 |page=116 |pages= |at= |chapter= |quote=In a late Qing dynasty work which has a section on boat people that mainly refers to those in Fujian, common surnames are said to be Weng 翁 ('old fisherman'), Ou 歐, Chi 池 (pond), Pu 浦 (river bank), Jiang 江 (river) and Hai 海 (sea).

In 1970, Whitney was hired by [[Florida State University]] to represent behavioral genetics in the [[psychobiology]] program, where he stayed until his death at the age of 62 on January 8, 2002, after contracting a severe cold that aggravated emphysema.&lt;ref name=achems&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.achems.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3298 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822224933/http://www.achems.org/i4a/pages/Index.cfm?pageID=3298 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-22 |title=Glayde Whitney |work=Homepage |publisher=Association for Chemoreception Sciences |accessdate=2011-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered himself to be a "[[Hubert Humphrey]] liberal."&lt;ref name=foreword&gt;Whitney, Glayde.

== Work in behavioral genetics ==
Whitney was the author of over 60 papers on the genetics of [[taste]] sensitivity in inbred mice. Support for some of this work came from a prestigious Claude Pepper Award for Research Excellence from the [[National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders]] and in 1994 he received the Manheimer Lectureship Award from the [[Monell Chemical Senses Center]], which recognizes career achievements of individuals in the chemosensory sciences.&lt;ref name=achems/&gt; At the height of his genetics career, he was the president of the [[Behavior Genetics Association]] from 1994 to 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bga.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1995_BGA-Richmond-1995.pdf |title=25th Annual Meeting |date=1995 |website=Behavior Genetics Association|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political controversies ==
The later years of his career were embroiled in controversy. Whitney was a frequent contributor to magazines such as ''[[Mankind Quarterly]]'', ''The g Factor Newsletter'' and ''The William McDougall Newsletter''. While outgoing president of the Behavior Genetics Association in 1995, some members of this group demanded his resignation after his presidential address suggested the need to investigate the possibility of genetic factors behind the high incidence of black crime in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Yong-Kyu |editor1-last=Kim |last1=Loehlin |first1=John |authorlink1=John C.

Controversy and the Development of Behavior Genetics |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-05831-3 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitney generated further controversy in August 1998 when he wrote the foreword for ''[[My Awakening: A Path to Racial Understanding|My Awakening]],'' an autobiography by [[David Duke]], a politician and former [[Grand Wizard]] of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. In the book, Duke uses [[Genetics|genetic science]] to push for the re-segregation of schools – arguing it is better to group children "in line with their natural abilities." Though Whitney declined to endorse Duke's re-segregation plan,&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; his foreword supported the value of the book, despite the reputation of Duke, as a collection of scientific evidence, describing it as "a painstakingly documented, academically excellent work of [[sociobiological]]-political history ... provid[ing] on the order of a thousand references and footnotes."

Whitney spoke against a putative disparity in expert and public opinion regarding race behavioral genetics, and claimed private discussions at scientific meetings had become disjointed from public pronouncements. He argued that opponents of such research are positioned against the scientific tradition of open inquiry, maintained even when one detests another's subject. Whitney praised the scientific achievements of Jews, but accused "organized Jewry" of playing a prominent role in suppressing race behavioral genetics in response to [[racism]] directed toward them, resulting in a "dishonest and hypocritical version of [[egalitarianism]]." Whitney was a member of the [[Institute for Historical Review]], a [[Holocaust denial]] organization, and he made the case for its views.

In reading Duke's work, Whitney noted, "I discovered that Duke's 'racism' was not born of hatred, but of science and history." Whitney made a [[hereditarianism|hereditarian]] argument for the racial IQ disparity found in intelligence research, and regarded [[affirmative action]] as the result of a larger disparity between [[public rhetoric]] and scientific realities.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As the hard scientific data came in, it became more certain that genetic differences (heredity) played a large role in the discrepancy. But in public it became [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] to even acknowledge that there was a difference."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--This summary uses Whitney's wording where possible.--&gt;
In the controversy following, Whitney received death threats. He felt that the controversy distracted from what was meant to be a scientific discussion and stated that "races are different for many genetic systems that influence everything from behavior and psychology to physiology, medicine and sports [...] Screaming nasty words does not change the reality."&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/1999/06/25/genetics/ |title=Reading genes in black and white |author=Chris Colin |work=Salon Books |date=1999-04-26 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitney's views regarding race and intelligence prompted the [[Florida Senate]] to pass Resolution 2742 in 1999, "condemning the racism and bigotry espoused by Florida State University Professor Glayde Whitney."&lt;ref name=salon /&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word Haratin has been traced to two roots. The first root is from ''haratine'', the Arabic word for "plowmen".&lt;ref name="AppiahGates2010p549"/&gt; The second [[etymology]] is based from the Berber word ''ahardan'' referring to skin color, more specifically "dark color".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hamel | first=Chouki El | title=Race, slavery and Islam in Maghribi Mediterranean thought: the question of the Haratin in Morocco | journal=The Journal of North African Studies | publisher=Routledge | volume=7 | issue=3 | year=2002 | pages=29–52 | doi=10.1080/13629380208718472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The origins of the Haratin people are in various black African ethnic groups in the sub-Saharan and Sahel regions of West Africa, such as Bambara, Soninke and others. They were raided or captured during war and brought into the Saharan lands as slaves.&lt;ref name="AppiahGates2010p549"/&gt;&lt;ref name=shoup115/&gt; Their ancestors and they have worked in arable lands particularly around the oases across the Sahara. They adopted the language and culture of the people who owned them, and they now speak Berber or Arabic. In countries such as Morocco, they are sometimes classified either as Berber or Arab, depending on their language and society they are found in.&lt;ref name=shoup115/&gt; In Mauritania, however, where there are nearly 1.5 million Haratins, they have developed a separate sense of ethnic identity.&lt;ref name=shoup115/&gt;

They have historically inherited their slave status and family occupation, have been endogamous and socially segregated.&lt;ref name="AppiahGates2010p549"/&gt;&lt;ref name=meyers427/&gt; Some communities differentiated two types of slaves, one called ''`Abid'' or "slave" and ''Haratin'' or "freed slave". However, states John Shoup – a professor of Anthropology, both 'Abid and Haratin were not free to own land or had equivalent property rights.&lt;ref name=shoup115/&gt; Regardless of whether they were technically free or not, they were treated as socially inferior in the communities they lived in. Being denied the right and the ability to own any land, they historically survived by accepting a patron-client serf relationship either as domestic servant or as share-cropping labor (''khammasin'').&lt;ref name="KleinMiers2013p58"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin A. Klein|author2=Suzanne Miers|title=Slavery and Colonial Rule in Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d3EnNSaMKBoC |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0714648842|pages=58–59, 79–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chouki El Hamel|title=Black Morocco: A History of Slavery, Race, and Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwogAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-62004-8|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They became the target for conscription by the Moroccan ruler [[Ismail Ibn Sharif]] as he sought to build a military who had no social or cultural attachment to any other Arab or Berber group in Maghreb, and he conscripted all Haratin and 'Abid he found in any Moroccan town. This Haratin army was then forced into a series of wars in order to consolidate the power of Ismail.&lt;ref name=meyers427/&gt;&lt;ref name="KleinMiers2013p58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willis2005p2"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Ralph Willis|title=Slaves and Slavery in Africa: Volume Two: The Servile Estate|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HVGRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2| year=2005| publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-78016-6|pages=2–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haratin in Mauritania==
{{see also|Slavery in Mauritania}}
In Mauritania, the Haratin form one of the largest [[ethnic group]]s and account for as much as 40% of the Mauritanians. They are sometimes referred to as "Black [[Moors]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/03/world/mauritania.slaverys.last.stronghold/index.html | work=CNN | title=Slavery's last stand - CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[Beidane]], or "White Moors". The Haratin are Arabic-speakers. They are either former slaves or the descendants of slaves from sub-Saharan West Africa, some acquired by Berbers after the 3rd century, and others after the arrival of the Arabs.&lt;ref name="Appiah, Kwame Anthony and Henry Louis Gates Jr. 2010 549"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Appiah, Kwame Anthony  |author2=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|title=Encyclopedia of Africa: Two-Volume Set|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195337709|pages=549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them have origins in the ethnic groups such as the [[Bambara people|Bambara]], [[Fula people|Fulani]], [[Soninke people|Soninké]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] people. They have adopted the language and culture of the Berber or Arab community they have lived with.&lt;ref name=shoup115/&gt;

The Haratin of Mauritania, states Joseph Hellweg – a professor of Anthropology specializing on West African studies, were part of a social caste-like hierarchy that likely developed from a [[Bedouin]] legacy between 1300 and 1500 CE. The "Hassan" monopolized the occupations related to war and politics, the "Zwaya" (Zawaya) the religious roles, the "Bidan" (White Moors) owned property and held slaves (Haratins, Black Moors), and the slaves constituted the lowest of the social strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph R Hellweg|editor=Mark Juergensmeyer and Wade Clark Roof|title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwJzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA761|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6656-5|page=761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these were castes, endogamous, with hereditary occupations and where the upper strata collected tribute (''horma'') from the lower strata of Mauritanian society, considered them socially inferior, and denied them the right to own land or weapons thereby creating a socio-economically closed system.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony G. Pazzanita (1999), Middle East Journal, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4329283 Political Transition in Mauritania: Problems and Prospects], Volume 53, Number 1 (Winter, 1999), pages 44-58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Ann Wiley (2016), Making People Bigger: Wedding Exchange and the Creation of Social Value in Rural Mauritania, Africa Today, Johns Hopkins University Press, Volume 62, Number 3, pages 48-69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melinda Smale (1980), [http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAJ464.pdf Women in Mauritania], USAID: Mauritania, Office of Women in Development, Agency for International Development, OICD Washington DC, page viii-ix, xviii-xix, 12-17, 35-36, 43; Quote: "Caste is the most specific of these crucial concepts. When applied to West African societies, it is used in the very general meaning of the division of societies into hierarchically rank-endogamous-occupational groups; the relation between these groups having ritual as well as economic significance. (...) To understand Mauritanian society, one must understand its ethnic groups, its tribes, socio-economic classes and its castes. The Hassaniya speakers who predominate over the majority of the country except along the river are divisible into two crucial subgroups - the Bidan or white Moors and the Haratin or black Moors. The Bidan are traditionally further divided into Z'waya (religious or "marabout" groups), Hassan (warrior groups), Zenaga (free tributary groups), Mu'allamin (craftsmen) and Ighyuwn (entertainers) (...)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Mauritania officially abolished slavery, and made another update to its slavery law in 1981.&lt;ref name="Appiah, Kwame Anthony and Henry Louis Gates Jr. 2010 549"/&gt; However, even after the formalities, abolishment and new laws, discrimination against Haratin is still widespread, and many continue to be, for all practical purposes, enslaved, while large numbers live in other forms of informal dependence on their former masters.&lt;ref name="Appiah, Kwame Anthony and Henry Louis Gates Jr. 2010 549"/&gt;

[[File:Les petites bonnes de Mauritanie suscitent un débat social (5631930858).jpg|thumb|In Mauritania, the use of Haratin girls as servants has attracted activists.]]
[[Amnesty International]] reported that in 1994 90,000 Haratine still lived as "property" of their master, with the report indicating that "slavery in Mauritania is most dominant within the traditional upper class of the Moors."&lt;ref name="Afrol News"&gt;[http://www.afrol.com/articles/17518 Afrol News]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mauritanian officials, any master-serf relationship is mutually consensual. This position has been questioned by the United Nations and human rights advocacy groups.&lt;ref name="Appiah, Kwame Anthony and Henry Louis Gates Jr. 2010 549"/&gt;

The Amnesty International report states that "[s]ocial attitudes have changed among most urban Moors, but in rural areas, the ancient divide is still very alive." There have been many attempts to assess the real extension of slavery in modern Mauritania, but these have mostly been frustrated by the Nouakchott government's official stance that the practice has been eliminated. Amnesty further estimated that some 300,000 freed slaves continued to be in service of their former masters.&lt;ref name="Afrol News"/&gt;

==Haratin in Morocco==
Haratin have been the slave strata of the Moroccan society through its recorded history.&lt;ref name=meyers427/&gt; They were owned in every town and farming centers before the time of Moroccan ruler [[Ismail Ibn Sharif]]. They provided domestic labor, farm labor, physical labor inside towns and markets, as well as were conscripted to fight wars.&lt;ref name="KleinMiers2013p58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willis2005p2"/&gt;

According to Remco Ensel – a professor of Anthropology specializing in Maghreb studies, the word "Haratin" in Moroccan is a pejorative that connotes "subordination, disrepute" and in contemporary literature, it is often replaced with "Drawi", "Drawa", "Sahrawi", "Sahrawa" or other regional terms.&lt;ref name="Ensel1999p2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Remco Ensel|title=Saints and Servants in Southern Morocco |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2dgt8geqUzoC&amp;pg=PA2 |year=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-11429-7|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamel2014p4"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chouki El Hamel|title=Black Morocco: A History of Slavery, Race, and Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwogAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4 |year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-62004-8|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moroccan Haritin, states Chouki El Hamel – a professor of History specializing in African Studies, are the diaspora of black West Africans who were forcefully transported across the Sahara and sold in Moroccan slave markets over centuries. They absorbed the "Arabo-centric values in the dominant interpretation of Islam", states El Hamel, over the generations and they see themselves as Muslim Moroccans, rather than by their ethnic or native group.&lt;ref name="Hamel2014p4"/&gt;

The Haratin strata, as slave workers, were a major institution of Moroccan society through the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohammed Ennaji |title=Serving the Master: Slavery and Society in 19th Century Morocco| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABfjsYid1JQC |year=1999 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-21152-3|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there has been a general lack of historical records about their origins and ethnography, leading to several constructed proposals, and their mention is older Moroccan literature is generally limited to their status as slaves and more focussed on the rights on their owners.&lt;ref name="Hamel2014p4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hassan2012p189"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohamed Hassan|title=Between Caravan and Sultan: The Bayruk of Southern Morocco: A Study in History and Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zbQyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189|year=2012|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-18382-7|pages=189–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is their contemporary economic and social marginalization that is awakened renewed interest in their history and their oral histories.&lt;ref name="Hamel2014p4"/&gt;

The Haratins remain indispensable workers in modern oases societies, states Ensel, and continue to be mistreated in contrast to the upper strata called the "Shurfa".&lt;ref name="Ensel1999p2"/&gt; According to Remco Ensel, ''Haratin'' along with ''Swasin'' in Morocco and other northern fringe societies of the Sahara, were a part of a social hierarchy that included the upper strata of nobles, religious specialists and literati, followed by freemen, nomadic pastoral strata and slaves. The Haratin were hierarchically higher than the ''`Abid'' (descendant of slaves) at the very bottom, but lower than ''Ahrar''. This hierarchy, states Ensel, has been variously described as ethnic groups, estates, quasi-castes, castes or classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chouki El Hamel|title=Black Morocco: A History of Slavery, Race, and Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwogAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4 |year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-62004-8|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hamel112&gt;{{cite book|author=Chouki El Hamel|title=Black Morocco: A History of Slavery, Race, and Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwogAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-62004-8|pages=92, 112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haratins historically lived segregated from the main society, in a rural isolation.&lt;ref name=hamel112/&gt; Their subjugation was sometimes ideologically justified by nobles and some religious scholars, even though others disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chouki El Hamel|title=Black Morocco: A History of Slavery, Race, and Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwogAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-62004-8|pages=112–113, 172–173}}, Quote: "This new meaning was an ideological construct to justify the subjugation of the free/freed blacks [Haratin] and was buttressed by documents that sought to advance the Makhzan's agenda by demonstrating that the Haratin were of slave origin, therefore creating a racialized caste".&lt;/ref&gt; The social stratification of Haratin and their inter-relationships with others members of the society varied by valley and oasis, but whether the Haratins were technically 'unfreed, semi-freed or freed' slaves, they were considered as "inferior" by other strata of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chouki El Hamel|title=Black Morocco: A History of Slavery, Race, and Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwogAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4 |year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-62004-8|pages=3, 45–46, 57–59, 244–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Haratin remain the marginalized population of Morocco, just like other similar groups around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Remco Ensel|title=Saints and Servants in Southern Morocco |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2dgt8geqUzoC&amp;pg=PA2 |year=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-11429-7|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haratine in Western Sahara==
According to Human Rights Watch, Morocco alleges that slavery is widespread in the [[Refugee camps in Tindouf Province, Algeria|Tindouf refugee camps]] run by the [[Polisario Front]] in south-western [[Algeria]]; POLISARIO denies this and claims to have eradicated slavery through awareness campaigns. A 2009 investigative report by [[Human Rights Watch]] interviewed some dark-skinned Sahrawis, who are a small minority in the camps; they stated that some "blacks" are "owned" by "whites" but this ownership manifested only in "granting" marriage rights to girls. In other words, a dark-skinned girl must have an approval from her "white master". Without this the marriage can not be performed by a Qadi (Islamic Judge).&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

The report notes that POLISARIO claims to oppose any such discrimination, but raises questions about possible official collusion in, or indifference to, the practice. In addition, a case of an official document that grants freedom to a group of enslaved families has been found by HRW. The document in question dates as recently as 2007. The document was signed by a local judge or an official civil servant. Slavery is still engraved in memories due to historical and traditional reasons, and such cases are not as shocking as one might think to the society of the Sahrawi refugee camps.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt; The Human Rights Watch concludes its chapter on slavery as follows, "In sum, credible sources testified to Human Rights Watch about vestiges of slavery that continue to affect the lives of a portion of the black minority in the Tindouf camps. The practices involve historical ties between families that involve certain rights and obligations that are not always clear. Being a slave does not necessarily preclude enjoying freedom of movement."

Responding to questions about slavery, the POLISARIO has acknowledged the survival "to a limited extent, of certain practices related to antiquated thinking" and said it was "determined to combat and eradicate them whenever they emerge and no matter what shape they take." We welcome this statement and urge the POLISARIO to be vigilant in pursuing this objective."&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights in Western Sahara and the Tindouf Refugee Camps|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/77259/section/10|accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hulaulá''' ({{Lang-he|'''יהודיותא'''}}) is a modern [[Jew]]ish [[Aramaic language]], often called ''Neo-Aramaic'' or ''Judeo-Aramaic''. It was originally spoken in [[Kurdistan Province (Iran)|Iranian Kurdistan]] and small parts in the easternmost parts of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. Most speakers now live in Israel. The name ''Hulaulá'' simply means 'Jewish'.

Speakers sometimes call their language ''Lishana Noshan'' or ''Lishana Akhni'', both of which mean 'our language'. To distinguish it from other dialects of Jewish Neo-Aramaic, Hulaulá is sometimes called ''Galiglu'' ('mine-yours'), demonstrating different use of prepositions and pronominal suffixes. Scholarly sources tend simply to call it ''Persian Kurdistani Jewish Neo-Aramaic''.

Hulaulá is written in the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. Spelling tends to be highly phonetic, and elided letters are not written.

== Origin==
Hulaulá sits at the southeastern extreme of the wide area over which various Neo-Aramaic dialects used to be spoken. From [[Sanandaj]], the capital of [[Kurdistan Province, Iran]], the area extended north, to the banks of [[Lake Urmia]]. From there, it extended west to [[Lake Van]] (in [[Turkey]]), and south onto the Plain of [[Mosul]] (in [[Iraq]]). Then it headed east again, through [[Arbil]], back to [[Sanandaj]].

The upheavals in their traditional region after the [[First World War]] and the founding of the State of Israel led most of the [[Persian Jews]] to settle in the new homeland in the early 1950s. Most older speakers still have [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] as a second language, while younger generations have [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Hulaulá is the strongest of all the Jewish Neo-Aramaic languages, with around 10,000 speakers. Almost all of these live in Israel, with a few remaining in Iran, and some in the United States.

==Intelligibility==
Hulaulá is somewhat intelligible with the Jewish Neo-Aramaic of Lake Urmia and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]: [[Lishan Didan]]. It is also somewhat intelligible with its western neighbour, the Jewish Neo-Aramaic of Arbil: [[Lishanid Noshan]]. However, it is unintelligible with the Christian Neo-Aramaic of Sanandaj: [[Senaya language|Senaya]]. Christians and Jews spoke completely different Neo-Aramaic languages in the same region. Like other Judaeo-Aramaic languages, Hulaulá is sometimes called ''[[Targum (Aramaic dialect)|Targumic]]'', due to the long tradition of translating the [[Hebrew Bible]] into Aramaic, and the production of [[targum]]s.

==Influences==
The various dialects of Hulaulá were clustered around the major settlement areas of Jews in the region: the cities of [[Sanandaj]] and [[Saqqez]] in [[Kurdistan Province, Iran]], with a southern outpost at Kerend, and a cluster in the [[Iraq]]i city of [[Sulaymaniyah]]. Hulaulá is full of loanwords from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]].

==2013 Boycott Campaign==
On 7 May 2013,  physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] informed the organizers that he was cancelling his participation as keynote speaker.  He indicated that this was in support of the academic boycott protesting Israel's treatment of Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/08/stephen-hawking-israel-academic-boycott Stephen Hawking joins academic boycott of Israel] The Guardian, 2012-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later found that among the 20 academics who lobbied Hawking to boycott were Professor [[Noam Chomsky]] and Professor Malcolm Levitt who advocated boycott as the proper method for scientist to respond to the "explicit policy" of "systemic discrimination" against the non-Jewish and Palestinian population. Hawkings decision was heavily criticized by several academics, including former [[Harvard University]] president [[Larry Summers]] and [[David Newman (political geographer)|David Newman]], who warned that "an academic boycott just destroys one of the very few spaces left where Israelis and Palestinians actually do come together." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Noam Chomsky helped lobby Stephen Hawking to stage Israel boycott|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/10/noam-chomsky-stephen-hawking-israel-boycott|accessdate=11 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 May 2013|author=Robert Booth and Harriet Sherwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/former-harvard-president-summers-rebukes-hawking-for-boycotting-israeli-conference.premium-1.531067 Summers at IPC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Muslim-writer-touts-Israeli-tolerance-of-minorities-314241 Muslim writer touts Israeli tolerance of minorities]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jam Khairuddin Al-Maroof Jam Tamachi bin Jam Unar''' ({{lang-sd|ڄام خيرالدين المعروف ڄام تماچي بن ڄام انڙ }},{{lang-ur|جام خيرالدين المعروف ڄام تماچي بن جام انر}})  was a famous ruler of [[Sindh]]. He belonged to the Unar tribe of Sindh, [[Pakistan]].

== History ==
The army of Sultan [[Alauddin Khalji]] arrived in the vicinity of [[Bukkur]], reconquered that fort, and prepared to go to [[Sehwan]]. A fight took place between them and the [[Samma Dynasty|Samma]], in which the latter were defeated. Jam Tamachi and his whole family was taken prisoner and carried to Delhi, where he had to live for many years in exile.

In the absence of their ruler, the people lived quietly around Tharri under Jam Tamachi’s brother Babinah son of Jam Unar, as their headman. After some years, Khairuddin son of Jam Tamachi, who in his infancy had gone with his father to [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi]], was permitted to return to Sindh after his father’s death and was to be the chief of his tribe. Accordingly Jam Khairuddin came and took the helm of the government of his father’s country.

In a short time [[Sultan]] [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] came to Sindh via Gujrat, in pursuit of the rebel Taghi. Muhammad bin Tughluq wanted to see Jam Khairuddìn, but the latter avoided meeting him, as he had for years remained a prisoner with him. Angered by the act, Sultan attacked on Sindh but died in the vicinity of [[Thatta]]. Sultan was succeeded by his son [[Firuz Shah Tughluq]], who hastened to [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi]] without conquering Sindh. Jam Khairuddin followed him to Sann near [[Sehwan]], returned to his capital, and commenced ruling the country quietly and justly.

An example of his justice may be given here.

:It is said that one day, going with a cavalcade, he passed through a desert, where he saw a heap of human bones. He halted for a few minutes and remarked to his followers that the bones were appealing to him for a just inquiry into their case. He sent for an old man living in a neighboring village and by making minute inquiries from him and others. He learned that seven years before a party of travelers coming from Gujarat to Sindh had been robbed and murdered by a band of robbers. He then secured some of the property of which they had been robbed, with the robbers. He sent the same to the ruler of Gujarat so that the robbers be punished by him. At his death Jam Khairuddin was succeeded by his son Jam Babino bin Jam Khairuddin.

The '''Jethal''' are a clan found in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]].

== History and origin ==
The Jethal claim [[Jat people|Jatt]] descent, but its pedigree is traced to be a Sindh Mahar, who some 12 or 14 generations ago, married the sister of a [[Ghurids|Ghouri]] king. The king, however, drove Mahar with his 21 sons in the [[Kirana Bar]]. Mahar eventually crossed the [[Jhelum River]], and settled at Ratta Pind, now a mound near the town of Kandwal. According to other traditions, they are [[Jat people|Jatt]] by origin. They own four villages of Jethal, Musiana, Dhudi Thal and Kahaana. They use Mahar and Ch as their titles. 
They are considered to be the descent of Sardarzai phara of Mahar tribe.

They are also said to have originally settled at Ucch Shah Jalal, the modern town of Uch in [[Bahawalpur]].

== Language Policy and Planning of Iran ==
The current '''Language Policy''' of Iran is addressed on chapter two of the [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] (Articles 15 &amp; 16). It asserts that the Persian language is the [[Lingua franca|Lingua Franca]] of the Iranian nation and as such, bound to be used through all official government communications and schooling system. In addition, the constitution also recognizes the Arabic language as the language of Islam, giving it a formal status as the language of religion, and regulates its spreading within the Iranian national curriculum.

Due to the nation's unique social and ethnic diversity, the constitution also acknowledges and permits the use of minority languages in the mass media as well as within the schools, in order to teach their literature. The minority languages of Iran do not receive a formal status and are not officially regulated by the authorities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Riazi, Abdolmehdi. '''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Angel_Lin/publication/234705882_Decolonisation_Globalisation_Language-in-Education_Policy_and_Practice_New_Perspectives_on_Language_and_Education/links/0046353b491da6f274000000.pdf#page=117 The Four Language Stages in the History of Iran.]''' In: Martin, Peter W; Lin, Angel (Eds.). ''Decolonisation, Globalisation: Language-in-education Policy and Practice''. (Buffalo: Multilingual Matters, Ltd. 2005). pp. 98-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first legislation which granted the Persian language its status was initiated back in 1906, as part of an electoral law that positioned it as the official language of the state of Iran, its government, its political institutions and its legal system. In the course of time this enactment followed by others, which eventually lead to a monolingual policy by the Iranian regime.

Perceiving multilingualism as a threat to the nation’s unity and Territorial integrity, and seeing the need to restrict minority languages’ use and to advance the Persian language’s hegemony, Iran’s language policy consists of a non-translation outline as well: all government, administration and educational settings are obliged to use merely Persian for any written communication. That includes political institutions (i.e. the Iranian Parliament), official bureaucratic communication (forms, signage etc.) and schooling (all children from the age of six and up are exposed only to Persian as the language of teaching and learning and of textbooks within the public school system). In other words, the Iranian authorities holds that minorities needs to learn the Iranian vernacular to an extent that will allow them to communicate with state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Haddadian-Moghaddam, Esmaeil; Meylaerts, Reine. '''[http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/35946252/What_about_translation_2014_sample.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1491355333&amp;Signature=2KoiE1ydLX1G%2FS15wZ3zEcJoZsg%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DWhat_about What about Translation?

With regard to the Iranian '''Language Planning''', among the institutions accountable for advancing the Iranian Language Planning (e.g. Ministry of Education and Ministry of Science, Research and Technology) is the [[Academy of Persian Language and Literature]], which was established on 1991. Constantly seeking to revise and elaborate the nation’s official language, this institute focuses on the linguistics of the Persian language and on the internal aspects of Language Planning, rather than on minority languages use within the Iranian society. Other aspects of Language Planning (e.g. sociolinguistic or functional literacy) have not been assigned to a formal institute and are currently handled free of any official master plan, by the educational ministries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Ethnicities_and_religions_in_Iran.png|thumb|250px|Iran main languages]]

== Activities ==

=== Popularization of heraldry ===
Popularization of heraldry is accomplished through lectures, workshops and presence in the media.

Lectures were held by several speakers from home and abroad. Among the lecturers were Dr. Stoyan Antonov, President of the Bulgarian Heraldry and Vexillology Society, Prof. Dr. Ivan Balta from Faculty of Philosophy in Osijek, Croatia, which had several lectures, and Dr. Vujadin Ivanisevic from Institute for Byzantine Studies in Belgrade, Serbia.

Lectures on theoretical heraldry and practical training workshops were held in cooperation with several organizations. The biggest was the collaboration with the [[Museum of Macedonia]] on the project "The Amazing World of Heraldry“ during which, for three years lectures and workshops were held.

The popularization of heraldry, vexillology and phaleristics is accomplished through many articles in daily newspapers and appearances on broadcast media too.

=== Research of the Macedonian heraldic heritage ===
Studies of the Macedonian heraldic heritage is the central part of the activities of the society. Researches have been performed in archives, libraries, private collections in [[Zagreb]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Brussels]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].&lt;ref name="heraldika.org.mk"&gt;[http://heraldika.org.mk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/MkHerald-6.pdf "Macedonian Herald" no. 6]&lt;/ref&gt; Research results are exchanged and supplemented with colleagues from other countries on congresses and symposia, as well as discussion groups and forums.

=== Design of arms, flags, orders and decorations ===
Macedonian Heraldry Society is engaged in [[design]]ing coats of arms, flags, orders, decorations, etc. Among the most important are the [[Coat of arms of the President of the Republic of Macedonia]], the [[Coat of arms of the Macedonian Orthodox Church – Ohrid Archbishopric]] and the [[Order of Merit for Macedonia]].

The Macedonian Heraldry Society is actively working on improving the quality and standardization of the municipal heraldry in the Republic of Macedonia. Members of the society are authors of coats of arms and flags of the municipalities: [[Radoviš Municipality|Radovish]], [[Novo Selo Municipality|Novo Selo]], [[Kriva Palanka Municipality|Kriva Palanka]] and [[Municipality of Kočani|Kochani]]. The society was also consulted in the selection of several municipal arms.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Establishing a Heraldic Register ===
One of the activities of the society is establishing a register of both old and new heraldic achievements. For the registered arms, an appropriate matricula is issued. They are also published in "Macedonian Herald“.

== Beginnings ==

In 2000 the president of the society, Jovan Jonovski, published the website "Heraldry in Macedonia" where coats of arms and citations from the book ''[[Coats of Arms of Macedonia (book)|Coats of Arms of Macedonia]]'' by Dr. [[Aleksandar Matkovski]] were published, in English and Macedonian. The website was complemented with arms used in Macedonia: territorial, corporate and personal. The website began to publish information on historical, theoretical and heraldry in general. A group of interested individuals gathered around the website, mostly [[Macedonian diaspora|Macedonians from abroad]]. When sufficient number of interested individuals was finally reached, in July 2003 the Macedonian Heraldry Society was founded.

== "Macedonian Herald" ==

The Macedonian Heraldic Society publishes an official [[Magazine|journal]], "Macedonian Herald", where the members of the society publish [[Academic paper#Scholarly paper|articles]] regarding their researches, municipal coats of arms and flags are commented, heraldic achievements registered in the heraldic register are published, as well as articles in the field of phaleristics, signumanistics and emblematics.

The journal is bilingual, in Macedonian and English.

Besides the printed edition, "Macedonian Herald" is freely available on the website of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heraldika.org.mk/macedonian-herald/|title=Македонски Хералд - Македонско хералдичко здружение|work=heraldika.org.mk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Activities ==

The Macedonian Heraldry Society is a full member of [[Confédération Internationale de Généalogie et d'Héraldique]] (CIGH) since the 29th International Congress on Genealogy and Heraldic Sciences in Stuttgart, Germany, held in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heraldika.org.mk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/MkHerald5-web-s.pdf "Macedonian Herald" no. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 24th Congress of the [[International Federation of Vexillological Associations]] (FIAV) in August 2011 in Washington, USA, the society became a full member of this prestigious organization.&lt;ref name="heraldika.org.mk"/&gt;

The Macedonian Heraldry Society gave logistical support for the establishment of the [[Bulgarian Heraldry and Vexillology Society]] (BHVS). A MHS delegation regularly participates on BHVS annual meetings.

The president of the society attended the founding of the [[Croatian Heraldic and Vexillologic Association]] (CHVA).

The society also collaborates with the [[Serbian Heraldry Society]].

The members of the society have published articles in the specialized magazines: "Grb i Zastava" of the Croatian Heraldic and Vexillologic Association, "Herold" of the Bulgarian Heraldry and Vexillology Society and "Glas heralda" and "Ocilo" of the Serbian Heraldry Society.

'''Mediated deliberation''' is a form of deliberation that is achieved through the [[News media|media]] which acts as a mediator between the mass public and elected officials.  The communication professionals of the media relay information, values, and diverse points of view to the public in order for effective public deliberation to occur.&lt;ref name="John Gastil"&gt;Gastil, John. Political Communication and Deliberation. Los Angeles: Sage Publications, 2008. 43-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  Benjamin Page proposes mediated deliberation be a "division of labor" with the idea of using the media to deliver information between the elected officials and the public because modern problems make it impossible to rely on the elected officials to deliberate for the public.  The role of the media is to encourage discussion amongst the citizens to keep them engaged with their elected officials.&lt;ref name="Benjamin Page"&gt;Page, Benjamin I. 1996. ''Who deliberates? Mass media in modern democracy.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideal form ==

Mediated deliberation follows the conception of a [[deliberative democracy]].  According to [[Jürgen Habermas]], a German philosopher, "no modern political process could function effectively without the "professionals of the media system" and the various elites who produce mediated political communication." &lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; This ideal mediated deliberation would:&lt;blockquote&gt;
to mobilize and pool relevant issues and required information, and to specify interpretations; to process such contributions discursively by means of proper arguments for and against; and to generate rationally motivated ''yes'' and ''no'' attitudes [i.e., public opinions] that are expected to determine the outcome of procedurally correct decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showFullText?submitFullText=Full+Text+HTML&amp;doi=10.1111%2Fj.1468-2885.2006.00280.x&amp;cookieSet=1] Jürgen Habermas (2006) Political Communication in Media Society: Does Democracy Still Enjoy an Epistemic Dimension? The Impact of Normative Theory on Empirical Research Communication Theory 16 (4), 411–426&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Through this ideal model, mediated deliberation should promote public knowledge on important issues as well as encouraging public opinion through enlightenment.

To achieve an effective mediated deliberation, it requires collective responsibility from the media producers, including newspapers, television broadcasters, and the internet.  The media needs to reliable because many people gain information and knowledge about events and issues.  Robert Goodwin, a philosopher, described the idea of "deliberation within" which is the deliberation that occurs in an individual's mind.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; "The point in having a deliberative media process is for individuals to hear conflicting considerations and weigh them to arrive at their own judgments." &lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; Through the analytic and social processes of deliberation, the table shows the roles that the media producers and media users need to fulfill in order for the ideal, mediated deliberation to occur.  In the analytic process, it involves introspection on subjective values while reflecting on personal and emotional experiences with facts.  The following tables are copyrighted © 2008 by Sage Publications, Inc from John Gastil’s book, ''Political Communication and Deliberation.''  
{| class="wikitable"
'''''Analytic Process'''''&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt;
|-
! 
! ''Media Producers''
! ''Media Users''
|-
| Create a solid information base.
| Present media users with a broad base of background information by reporting extensively on important issues.
| Seek out opportunities to learn of others' experiences and relevant expert analysis.
|-
|Prioritize the key values at stake.
|Explore the underlying public concerns behind the surface facts and events that define an issue.
|Consider the diverse concerns underlying issues and how others prioritize issues differently.
|-
|Identify a broad range of solutions.
|Present the broadest possible range of solutions to problems, including nongovernmental and unpopular ones.
|Learn about how people like or unlike yourself think about addressing a problem.
|-
|Weigh the pros, cons, and trade-offs among solutions.
|Report different viewpoints but do more than juxtapose them; subject them to careful scrutiny.
|Reassess your biases favoring or opposing different solutions by seeing how others weigh pros and cons.
|-
|Make the best decision possible.
|Make recommendations but keep editorial content distinct from news; leave the decision to the media user.
|Take responsibility for making up your own mind after listening to the advice of experts, partisans, and others.
|}

Along with the analytic process, the social process involves more equal access and comprehension while considering other diverse points of view.

'''''Social Process'''''&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! ''Medial Producers''
! ''Media Users''
|-
| Adequately distribute speaking opportunities.
| Use diverse sourcing, invite diverse guests with different ways of speaking, and reach beyond conventional debates.
| Make time to listen to sources with views different from your own.  Add your own voice when appropriate.
|-
| Ensure mutual comprehension.
| Make news and information understandable for readers; prose should be accessible to the audience.
| When you cannot understand an issue or argument, seek clarification from others.
|-
| Consider other ideas and experiences. 
| Take arguments from all perspectives seriously.
| When hearing different views, avoid tuning out or ruminating on counterarguments before considering what is said.
|-
| Respect other participants.
| Model respect for different views; treat readers with respect by making news serious but engaging
| Give the benefit of the doubt to sources but demand better behavior from those who violate your trust
|}

The analytic and social processes for mediated deliberation gives people the opportunity to evaluate the actions of media producers as well as their users.

==Assessing mediated deliberation==

===Examples of a non-deliberative media===

====Jon Stewart on ''Crossfire''====
As the host of "[[The Daily Show]]," [[Jon Stewart]] appeared on [[CNN]]'s former show ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'' on October 15, 2004.  Instead of discussing current events, Stewart argued that ''Crossfire'' "fails miserably" at providing its viewer audience with balanced information about politics. ''Crossfire'' "presented itself as part of the deliberative process yet engaged in "partisan hackery," Stewart concluded "[it was not an honest debate]".&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; Stewart accused ''Crossfire'' of not upholding the "responsibility to the public discourse" and instead, it appeared to be a political theater. In response to Stewart's remarks, CNN canceled ''Crossfire'' in 2005.

====Critiques of the media====
Lance Bennett noticed that the media tend to not present balanced viewpoints for current events.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; Shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, Bennett's research showed the media coverage to represent only one, popular political party without a strong opposition party.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt;

Benjamin Page analyzed the 1991 U.S. war against Iraq in the ''[[New York Times]]'' from November 9, 1990 to January 15, 1991 to examine whether or not the stories covered by the media were balanced and fair. Page wanted to see if there were a diversity of views about the war from a variety of sources.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; As a result, the editors and regular columnists consumed most of the ''Times'' in the most read sections of the paper while ordinary citizens' voices were placed in the Letters section. Page noted that few experts on the Middle East or peace groups were presented in columns even though the ''Times'' 's editors were evenly balanced among three views of the conflict with Iraq: entirely peaceful solution; the U.S. should continue to use economic sanctions followed by military intervention, if necessary; and immediate use of force.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; Page concluded that although the media were balanced with the three views of the editors, other major viewpoints were not included. For example, the overwhelming majority of the ''Times'' 's readers supported a more peaceful stance but their views "were not presented in proportion to their adherents among the general public".&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; Instead, their letters were presented in the Letters section which is less read than where the editors' and regular columnists' articles are located.  

Page criticizes the media for having "different media outlets [taking] distinctive political stands." &lt;ref name="Benjamin Page" /&gt;  Television programs tend to take stands in a more muted and subtle way through verbal statements while printed sources present their ideologies in relation to the interests of their audience over time.&lt;ref name="Benjamin Page" /&gt; In addition, Page notes that "''certain media outlets''--especially newspapers and magazines, but sometimes also television program networks--do not merely reflect the social and political forces around them; instead, they ''actively work to shape political discourse to their own purposes.''"&lt;ref name="Benjamin Page" /&gt; The media would emphasize points about a story that they want to make.

==Movement shift toward mediated deliberation==

===Civic/public journalism===
[[Civic journalism]] (sometimes called public journalism) is a movement that peaked in the 1990s as an attempt to reconnect with democracy and to increase persons' trust in journalism by being more debatable, neutral, and independent with an issue.  As attempts to achieve these goals, newspapers "redesigned their coverage to emphasize the concerns of citizens"; encourage citizens to discuss public issues, and change techniques in newsgathering and reporting.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt;

On January 25, 2003, the Public Journalism Network in Georgia established a declaration which made it clear that journalists believed in maintaining these changes in journalism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Public Journalism Network brings together a diverse group of print and electronic media organizations that share the same general goal of connecting with the public they serve and promoting not just media deliberation but also the kinds of conversations, discussions, and public meetings" &lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In brief, the [http://pjnet.org/charter/ Public Journalism Network Charter] states:&lt;ref&gt;"Charter Declaration: a Declaration for Public Journalism." Public Journalism Network. 25 Jan. 2003. 20 May 2008 &lt;http://pjnet.org/charter/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We believe journalism and democracy work best when news information and ideas flow freely; news fairly portrays a full range and variety of life and culture of all communities; when public deliberation is encouraged and amplified, and when news helps people function as political actors and not just political consumers...journalists should stand apart in making sound professional judgment and should not stand apart in learning about and understanding these communities...new techniques for storytelling and information-sharing to help individual communities to have their own voice as a whole set of communities...stories and images can help or hinder as people struggle to reach sound judgments about personal lives and well-being...to reach deeper into communities and serve people...listen to people...study dynamics of communities and the complexity of public life...journalism helps people see the world as a whole and helps them take responsibility for what they see." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Citizen Voices Project===
Modeling after the [[National Issues Forums]], Citizen Voices was a Philadelphian newspaper's "attempt to engage" across the diverse city during a 1999 mayoral race between a white Republican against a black Democrat.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Hendriks"&gt;Hendriks, Carolyn. The Deliberative Democracy Handbook: Strategies for Effective Civic Engagement in the 21st Century. 1st ed. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2005. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; After noticing skewed responses from more educated and affluent white readers in this racially divided city, Citizen Voices aimed to encourage more public involvement from lower class minorities by creating a citizens’ issues-oriented mayoral campaign. To invite participants from all backgrounds, Citizen Voices invented "The Oprah Show" as a comedic parody of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" as a way to get citizens to think about problems and solutions within their city. The second phase of the project included a National Issues Forum-style discussion where citizens deliberated on position papers that the mayoral candidates submitted and drafted five issues with their questions for the mayoral debate including: education, jobs, neighborhoods, public safety, and reforming city hall.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Hendriks" /&gt; The issue of race was added to these five topics due to race relations complicating Philadelphia's effort to address its problems. "Throughout the year, Citizen Voices remained a frequent presence on ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' 's opinion pages."&lt;ref name="Carolyn Hendriks" /&gt; Editorials on the campaign revolved around the issues that were picked by Citizens Voices and were even published on the commentary page in full-page layouts. Candidates were asked to respond to these questions on the issues that were drafted by citizens. As a result, it appeared that low-income participants were more willing and more confident to express their political views.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Hendriks" /&gt;

===Investigative journalism===
One of the best sources to see an example of a mediated deliberation is [[investigative journalism]]. The media responds and reports events that generate a lot of public concern or interests. In investigative journalism, the media conducts their own original research and investigation to uncover a news story that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; Sometimes, it is triggered from a reporter's hunch or even an outside source. For example, the ''Washington Post'' 's articles revealing the [[Watergate scandal]] involving President [[Richard Nixon]] through the famous "Deep Throat" outside source. Over the years, investigative reporting has steadily declined. In 2002, about one in 150 stories accounted for investigative journalism compared to one in 60 in 1998.&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt; This reduction has been caused by many factors including: 
*the increase in [[profit motive]] to produce news that will attract the most audience attention
*the perception that the investigative reporting is not increasing audience size nor loyalty
*libel suits involving the investigative stations 
*an increased demand on entertaining news 
&lt;ref name="John Gastil" /&gt;

Assuming the reports are valid, investigative journalism can improve mediated deliberation by serving as an objective, unbiased source. Reporters may present the necessary information and facts of an issue needed for individuals to decide the whether or not future action needs to take place.

The '''Muisca Confederation''' was a loose [[confederation]] of different [[Muisca people|Muisca]] rulers (''[[zaque]]s'', ''[[zipa]]s'', ''[[iraca]]'' and ''[[tundama]]'') in the central [[Andes|Andean]] highlands of present-day [[Colombia]] before the [[Spanish conquest of the Americas|Spanish conquest]] of northern [[South America]]. The area, presently called [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]], comprised the current [[departments of Colombia|departments]] of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and minor parts of [[Santander Department|Santander]] with a total surface area of approximately {{convert|25000|km2|sqmi}}.{{refn|group=note|While some sources state 47,000 km² as area,&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [https://taller5-histdiseno3b.wikispaces.com/file/view/INFORMACION+DISE%C3%91O+PRECOLOMBINO+MUISCA.pdf Muisca Confederation area almost 47,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, page 12]&lt;/ref&gt; that would be Cundinamarca and Boyacá combined and other indigenous groups were living in those areas}}

According to some [[List of Muisca scholars|Muisca scholars]] the Muisca Confederation was one of the best-organized confederations of tribes on the South American continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.historiacultural.com/2009/06/cultura-chibcha-muisca-ceramica-oro.html Muisca culture] - Historia Universal - accessed 21-04-2016&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[anthropologist]]s, such as [[Jorge Gamboa Mendoza]], attribute the present-day knowledge about the confederation and its organization more to a reflection by Spanish [[chronicler]]s who predominantly wrote about it a century or more after the Muisca were conquered and proposed the idea of a loose collection of different people with slightly different languages and backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Gamboa&gt;Gamboa Mendoza, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Muisca Confederation ==
[[File:Mapa Imperio Muisca.PNG|thumb|Location of the Muisca Confederation on the map of the Republic of Colombia.]]
In the times before the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]], the central part of present-day Colombia; the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian [[Andes]] was inhabited by the Muisca people who were organised in a loose confederation of [[Muisca rulers|rulers]]. The central authorities of [[Bogotá|Bacatá]] in the south and [[Tunja|Hunza]] in the north were called ''[[zipa]]'' and ''[[zaque]]'' respectively. Other rulers were the ''[[iraca]]'' priest in sacred City of the Sun [[Sogamoso|Sugamuxi]], the ''[[Tundama]]'' of [[Duitama|Tundama]] and various other ''[[cacique]]s'' (chiefs). The Muisca spoke [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]], in their own language called ''Muysccubun''; "language of the people".

The Muisca people, different from the other three great civilisations of the Americas; the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]] and [[Inca Empire|Inca]], did not build grand stone [[Muisca architecture|architecture]]. Their settlements were relatively small and consisted of ''bohíos''; circular houses of wood and clay, organised around a central market square with the house of the ''cacique'' in the centre. Roads were present to connect the settlements with each other and with the surrounding indigenous groups, of which the [[Guane people|Guane]] and [[Lache people|Lache]] to the north, the [[Panche people|Panche]] and [[Muzo people|Muzo]] to the west and [[Guayupe people|Guayupe]], [[Achagua people|Achagua]] and [[Tegua people|Tegua]] to the east were the most important.

=== History ===

==== Prehistory ====
{{see also|Altiplano Cundiboyacense#Prehistory}}
Early Amerindian settlers led a hunter-gatherer life among still extant [[megafauna]] living in cool habitats around Pleistocene lakes, of which the [[Wetlands of Bogotá|humedales]] in Bogotá, [[Lake Suesca]], [[Lake Fúquene]] and [[Lake Herrera]] are notable examples. Multiple evidences of late [[Pleistocene]] to middle [[Holocene]] population of the [[Bogotá savanna]], the high plateau in the Colombian Andes, have been found to date. As is common with [[Template:Navbox prehistoric caves|caves and rock shelters]], [[Tequendama]] was inhabited from around 11,000 years BP, and continuing into the prehistorical, [[Herrera Period|Herrera]] and [[Muisca people|Muisca]] periods, making it the oldest site of Colombia, together with [[El Abra]] (12,500 BP), located north of [[Zipaquirá]] and [[Tibitó]], located within the boundaries of [[Tocancipá]] (11,740 BP).&lt;ref name=Paleoindio&gt;{{es}} [http://aplicaciones.virtual.unal.edu.co/blogs/hacolombia/2011/03/13/1-nivel-paleoindio-abrigos-rocosos-del-tequendama/ Nivel Paleoindio.

{{main article|Herrera Period}}
The Herrera Period is a phase in the [[history of Colombia]]. It is part of the [[Andean preceramic]] and [[ceramic]], time equivalent of the [[North America]]n [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Formative stage|formative]] and [[classic stage]]s and age dated by various [[archaeologist]]s.&lt;ref name=Chronology&gt;{{es}} [http://www.cadb.pitt.edu/samaca/cronologia.pdf Chronology of pre-Columbian periods: Herrera and Muisca]&lt;/ref&gt; The Herrera Period predates the age of the [[Muisca people]], who inhabited the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] before the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]] and postdates the lithic formative stage and prehistory of the eastern Andean region in [[Colombia]]. The Herrera Period is usually defined as ranging from 800 BCE to 800 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Kruschek, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; although some scholars date it as early as 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek, 1995, Ch.4, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

Ample evidence of the Herrera Period has been uncovered on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense and main archaeologists contributing to the present knowledge about the Herrera Period are [[List of Muisca scholars|scholars]] [[Ana María Groot]], [[Gonzalo Correal Urrego]], [[Thomas van der Hammen]], [[Carl Henrik Langebaek Rueda]], [[Sylvia M. Broadbent]], [[Marianne Cardale de Schrimpff]] and others.

===== Muisca =====
{{Muisca sidebar}}
{{main|Muisca}}
The Muisca were [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] and their [[Muisca religion|religion]] and [[Muisca mythology|mythology]] was closely connected with the natural area they were inhabiting. They had a thorough understanding of [[Muisca astronomy|astronomical parameters]] and developed a complex [[lunar calendar|luni]]-[[solar calendar]]; the [[Muisca calendar]]. According to the calendar they had specific times for sowing, harvest and the organisation of festivals where they [[Muisca music|sang, danced and played music]] and drank their national drink [[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]] in great quantities.

The most respected members of the community were [[Muisca mummification|mummified]] and the mummies were not buried, yet displayed in their [[Muisca architecture#Temples|temples]], in natural locations such as caves and even carried on their backs during [[Muisca warfare|warfare]] to impress their enemies.

Their [[Muisca art|art]] is the most famous remnant of their culture, as living spaces, temples and other existing structures have been destroyed by the Spanish who colonised the Muisca territories. A primary example of their fine goldworking is the [[Muisca raft]], together with more objects made of gold, ''tumbaga'', ceramics and cotton displayed in the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Museo del Oro]] in [[Bogotá]], the ancient capital of the southern Muisca.

The Muisca were a predominantly agricultural society with small-scale farmfields, part of more extensive terrains. To diversify their diet, they traded mantles, [[gold]], [[emerald]]s and [[halite|salt]] for fruits, vegetables, [[coca]], [[Anadenanthera peregrina|yopo]] and [[cotton]] cultivated in lower altitude warmer terrains populated by their neighbours, the Muzo, Panche, Yarigui, Guane, Guayupe, Achagua, Tegua, Lache, Sutagao and U'wa. Trade of products grown farther away happened with the [[Calima culture|Calima]], [[Pijao people|Pijao]] and Caribbean coastal communities around the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]].

The Muisca economy was self-sufficient regarding the basic [[Muisca cuisine|supplies]], thanks to the advanced technologies of the agriculture on raised terraces by the people. The system of trade was well established providing both the higher [[social class]]es and the general population abundances of gold, feathers, marine snails, coca, yopo and other luxury goods. Markets were held every four to eight days in various settlements throughout the Muisca Confederation and special markets were organised around festivities where merchants from far outside the Andes were trading their goods with the Muisca.

Apart from agriculture, the Muisca were well developed in the production of different crafts, using the raw materials traded with surrounding indigenous peoples. Famous are the golden and ''tumbaga'' objects made by the Muisca people. Cotton mantles, cloths and nets were made by the [[Women in Muisca society|Muisca women]] and traded for valuable goods, tropical fruits and small cotton cloths were used as money. The Muisca were unique in South America for having real coins of gold, called ''tejuelos''.

Mining was an important source of income for the Muisca, who were called "Salt People" because of their salt mines in [[Zipaquirá]], [[Nemocón]] and [[Tausa]]. Like their western neighbours, the [[Muzo people|Muzo]] -who were called "The Emerald People"- they mined [[emerald]]s in their territories, mainly in [[Somondoco]]. [[Carbon]] was found throughout the region of the Muisca in [[Eocene]] sediments and used for the fires for cooking and the production of salt and golden ornaments.

The people used a decimal counting system and counted with their fingers. Their system went from 1 to 10 and for higher numerations they used the prefix ''quihicha'' or ''qhicha'', which means "foot" in their [[Chibcha language]] ''Muysccubun''. Eleven became thus "foot one", twelve "foot two", etc. As in the other [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] civilizations, the number 20 was special. It was the total number of all body extremities; fingers and toes. The Muisca used two forms to express twenty: "foot ten"; ''quihícha ubchihica'' or their exclusive word ''gueta'', derived from ''gue'', which means "house". Numbers between 20 and 30 were counted ''gueta asaqui ata'' ("twenty plus one"; 21), ''gueta asaqui ubchihica'' ("twenty plus ten"; 30). Larger numbers were counted as multiples of twenty; ''gue-bosa'' ("20 times 2"; 40), ''gue-hisca'' ("20 times 5"; 100). The Muisca script consisted of [[hieroglyph]]s, only used for numerals.&lt;ref&gt;Izquierdo Peña, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sacred sites ==
{{main article|Muisca mythology|Muisca religion}}
The sacred sites of the Muisca Confederation were based in the [[Muisca religion]] and [[Muisca mythology|mythology]]. The Muisca were a highly religious people with their own beliefs on the origin of the Earth and life and [[human sacrifices]] were no exception to please the gods for good harvests and prosperity.

'''[[Lake Guatavita]]''', [[Guatavita]], was the location where the new ''zipa'' would be inaugurated. It became known with the Spanish conquerors as the site of ''El Dorado'' where the new zipa was covered in [[gold]] dust and installed as the new ruler of the southern Muisca.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.casaculturalcolombiana.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=93&amp;Itemid=149&amp;lang=en Legend of ''El Dorado'' on the shores of Lake Guatavita] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404042807/http://www.casaculturalcolombiana.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=93&amp;Itemid=149&amp;lang=en# |date=2016-04-04 }} - Casa Cultural Colombiana - accessed 21-04-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In the legends of the Muisca, mankind originated in '''[[Lake Iguaque]]''', [[Villa de Leyva|Monquirá]], when the goddess [[Bachué]] came out from the lake with a boy in her arms. When the boy grew, they populated the Earth. They are considered the ancestors of the human race. Finally, they disappeared unto the lake in the shape of snakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.culturarecreacionydeporte.gov.co/es/bogotanitos/cuenta-la-leyenda/bachue-y-el-origen-del-hombre Birth of mankind from Lake Iguaque] - Cultura, Recreación y Deporte - accessed 21-04-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Muisca myths, the '''[[Tequendama Falls]]''', outside [[Soacha]], was the site where the first ''zipa'' [[Meicuchuca]] lost his beautiful lover who turned in a snake and disappeared in the waters of the [[Bogotá River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/serpiente.html Legend of the lover of Meicuchuca turning into a snake in the Tequendama Fallas] - Pueblos Originarios - accessed 21-04-2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.18, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''[[El Infiernito]]''''', close to the present town of [[Villa de Leyva]] was a sacred site where the Muisca erected structures based on [[Muisca astronomy|astronomical parameters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/infiernito.html ''El Infiernito''; astronomical site] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek, 2005b, p.282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izquierdo, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A delegation of more than 900 men left the tropical city of Santa Marta and went on a harsh expedition through the heartlands of Colombia in search of ''El Dorado'' and the civilisation that produced all this precious gold. The leader of the first and main expedition under [[Crown of Castile|Spanish flag]] was [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]], with his brother [[Hernán Pérez de Quesada|Hernán]] second in command.&lt;ref name=ConquistaGonzalo/&gt; Several other soldiers were participating in the journey, who would later become [[encomienda|encomenderos]] and taking part in the conquest of other parts of Colombia. Other contemporaneous expeditions into the unknown interior of the Andes, all searching for the mythical land of gold, were starting from later [[Venezuela]], led by [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] and other German conquistadors and from the south, starting in the previously founded [[Kingdom of Quito]] in later [[Ecuador]].

The first phase of the conquest was ended by the victory of the few conquistadors left over [[Tisquesusa]], the last ''[[zipa]]'' of [[Bogotá|Bacatá]], who fell and died "bathing in his own blood"after the battle at [[Funza]], on the [[Bogotá savanna]], April 20, 1537. The arrival of the Spanish conquerors was revealed to Tisquesusa by the [[mohan (legendary)|mohan]] Popón, from the village of [[Ubaque]]. He told the Muisca ruler that foreigners were coming and Tisquesusa would die "bathing in his own blood".&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/biografias/tisquesusa.html Tisquesusa would die bathing in his own blood] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt; When Tisquesusa was informed of the advancing invasion of the Spanish soldiers, he sent a spy to [[Suesca]] to find out more about their army strength, weapons and with how many warriors they could be beaten. The ''zipa'' left the capital Bacatá and took shelter in [[Nemocón]] which directed the Spanish troops to there, during this march attacked by more than 600 Muisca warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/biografias/tisquesusa Zipa Tisquesusa] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Tisquesusa retreated in his fort in [[Cajicá]] he allegedly told his men he would not be able to combat against the strong Spanish army in possession of weapons that produced "thunder and lightning". He chose to return to Bacatá and ordered the capital to be evacuated, resulting in an abandoned site when the Spanish arrived. In search for the Muisca ruler the conquistadores went north to find Tisquesusa in the surroundings of [[Facatativá]] where they attacked him at night.

Tisquesusa was thrusted by the sword of one of De Quesada's soldiers but without knowing he was the ''zipa'' he let him go, after taking the expensive mantle of the ruler. Tisquesusa fled hurt into the mountains and died of his wounds there. His body was only discovered a year later because of the [[black vulture]]s circling over it.

When Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada found out the ''caciques'' were conspiring against him, he sent out several expeditions of soldiers. His captain Juan de Céspedes went south to found [[Pasca]] on July 15, 1537.&lt;ref name=websitePasca&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.pasca-cundinamarca.gov.co/informacion_general.shtml Official website Pasca]&lt;/ref&gt; Hernán was sent north and Gonzalo himself went northeast, to search for the mythical Land of Gold ''[[El Dorado]]''. There he didn't find golden cities, but [[emerald]]s, the [[Muisca economy|Muisca]] were extracting in [[Chivor]] and [[Somondoco]]. First foundation was [[Engativá]], presently a locality of Bogotá, on May 22, 1537.&lt;ref name=TiempoEngativa/&gt; Passing through [[Suba (Bogotá)|Suba]], [[Chía, Cundinamarca|Chía]], [[Cajicá]], [[Tocancipá]], [[Gachancipá]], [[Guatavita]] and [[Sesquilé]], he arrived in [[Chocontá]], founding the modern town on June 9.&lt;ref name=websiteChoconta/&gt; The journey went eastward into the [[Tenza Valley]] through [[Machetá]], [[Tibiritá]], [[Guateque]], [[Sutatenza]] and [[Tenza]], founded on [[St John's Eve|San Juan]]; June 24.&lt;ref name=websiteTenza/&gt; On the same day, Hernán founded [[Sutatausa]].&lt;ref name=websiteSutatausa/&gt; Gonzalo continued northwest through [[La Capilla]] and [[Úmbita]]. He arrived in [[Turmequé]] that he founded on July 20.&lt;ref name=websiteTurmeque/&gt;

In August 1537 Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada entered the territories of the ''[[zaque]]'', who ruled from [[Tunja|Hunza]]. When the Spanish conquerors entered the outskirts of Hunza and found a hill with poles were bodies were dangling, they named it ''Cerro de la Horca'' ("Gallow Hill").&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/biografias/quemen.html Biography Quemuenchatocha] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the conquest [[Quemuenchatocha]] was the ''zaque'' and he ordered his men to not submit to the European invaders or show them the way to his ''bohío''. He sent messengers to the Spanish conquistadors with valuable peace offers. While this was happening, Quemuenchatocha had hidden his treasures from the Spanish. Hunza was located in a valley not as green as the [[Bogotá savanna]]. The advantage of the Spanish weaponry and the use of the horses quickly beat the Muisca warriors.&lt;ref name=ConquistaGonzalo/&gt;

When Gonzalo arrived at the main ''bohío'' of Quemuenchatocha, he found the Muisca ruler sitting in his throne and surrounded by his closest companions. All men were dressed in expensive mantles and adorned with [[gold]]en crowns. On August 20, 1537, the Spanish beat the ''zaque'' and the big and strong Muisca ruler was taken captive to [[Suesca]]. There he was tortured and the Spanish soldiers hoped he would reveal where he hid his precious properties. The absence of Quemuenchatocha paved the route for his nephew [[Aquiminzaque]] to succeed him as ruler of the northern Muisca, a [[Muisca women|practice common in Muisca traditions]]. When Quemuenchatocha was finally released from captivity in Suesca, he fled to [[Ramiriquí]], where he died shortly after. The Spanish soldiers found gold, emeralds, [[silver]], mantles and other valuables in Tunja. They were not able to take all the precious pieces and many were secretly taken away by the Muisca, using folded deer skins. They hid the 
valuables in nearby hills.&lt;ref name=ConquistaGonzalo/&gt;

Not only the Spanish settlers had lost large percentages of their men due to warfare and diseases. The assessed corregimientos of the Province of Tunja between 1537 and 1636 shows a decline of the total Muisca population between 65 and 85%.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 2002, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Epidemics were the main cause of the rapid reduction in population. Various have been reported and many undescribed in the first twenty years of contact.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 2002, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

After the foundation of Bogotá and the installation of the new dependency of the Spanish Crown, several strategies were important to the Spanish conquerors. The rich [[Muisca economy|mineral resources]] of the Altiplano had to be extracted, the [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]] was quickly reformed, a system of [[encomienda]]s was installed and a main concern of the Spanish was the [[evangelisation]] of the Muisca. On October 9, 1549, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos V]] sent a royal letter to the New Kingdom directed at the priests about the necessity of population reduction of the Muisca.&lt;ref name="Suárez_p128"&gt;Suárez, 2015, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous people were working in the encomiendas which limited their religious conversion.&lt;ref name="Suárez_p128"/&gt; To speed up the process of submittance to the Spanish reign, the mobility of the indigenous people was prohibited and the people gathered in [[resguardo]]s.&lt;ref name=Segura_p38&gt;Segura Calderón, 2014, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; The formerly celebrated festivities in their [[Muisca religion|religion]] disappeared. Specific times for the [[catechesis]] were controlled by laws, as executed in royal dictates in 1537, 1538 and 1551.&lt;ref name="Suárez_p125"&gt;Suárez, 2015, p.125&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[bishop]] of Santafé, [[Juan de los Barrios]], ordered to destroy the temples of the Muisca and replace them with catholic churches.&lt;ref name="Suárez_p129"&gt;Suárez, 2015, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; The last public religious ceremony of the Muisca religion was held in [[Ubaque]] on December 27, 1563.&lt;ref&gt;Londoño, 2001, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The second bishop of Santafé, [[Luis Zapata de Cárdenas]], intensified the aggressive policies against the Muisca religion and the burnings of their sacred sites. This formed the final nail in the coffin of the former polytheistic society.&lt;ref name="Suárez_p129"/&gt;

The transition to a mixed agriculture with [[Old World]] crops was remarkably fast, mainly to do with the fertility of the lands of the Altiplano permitting European crops to grow there, while in the more tropical areas the soil was not so much suited for the foreign crops. In 1555, the Muisca of [[Toca, Boyacá|Toca]] were growing European crops as [[wheat]] and [[barley]] and [[sugarcane]] was grown in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 1993, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; The previously self-sustaining economy was quickly transformed into one based on intensive agriculture and [[mining]] that produced changes in the landscape and culture of the Muisca.&lt;ref&gt;Martínez &amp; Manrique, 2014, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Teenager Mark Scott was murdered as he made his way home from a football match in [[Glasgow]] on October 7, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celtic fan’s murderer preparing for release from jail|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12602416.Celtic_fan___s_murderer_preparing_for_release_from_jail/|website=HeraldScotland|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark did not know his attacker, Jason Campbell. During Jason’s murder trial it was revealed that one of the motives for his attack was Mark’s perceived [[Religion|religious]] background based on the colour of his football scarf. Cara Henderson was 15 at the time her school friend was murdered. Four years later, in 1999, she began the process of establishing a campaign against sectarian hatred in Scotland.

Cara began campaigning in the media; telling her story at community events and lobbying [[politician]]s and policy makers. She launched a Charter for Change in 2000, which outlined Nil By Mouth’s vision for challenging sectarian attitudes in Scotland. Cara won a [[Philip Lawrence Awards|Philip Lawrence Award]] for her work in empowering [[young people]]. Despite no longer being actively involved, Cara Henderson remains an honorary patron of the charity.

In 2015, Cara was named [[Evening Times]] Scotswoman of The Year for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our SWOTY: Nil by Mouth founder Cara who fights against sectarianism in memory of Mark Scott|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13302293.Our_SWOTY__Nil_by_Mouth_founder_Cara_who_fights_against_sectarianism_in_memory_of_Mark_Scott/|website=Evening Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarded as one of the most prestigious awards in Scotland, Cara was chosen ahead of [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Nicola Sturgeon]].

[[File:Observationvm medicarvm Nicolaes Tulp 1641.JPG|thumb|right|250px|&lt;br /&gt;Title page from Prof. Tulp's 1641 book, published by [[Lodewijk Elzevir]].]]

[[File:Nicolaes Tulp 1641 3de capvt lvi satyr.JPG|thumb|right|250px|&lt;br /&gt;Page from Prof. Tulp's book with possibly the first published illustration of a chimpansee.]]
[[File:Nicolaes Tulp 1740 3e Satyr.JPG|thumb|right|250px|&lt;br /&gt;Same page from 1740 Wolzogen edition.]]

'''''Observationes Medicae'''''  is a 1641 book by [[Nicolaes Tulp]]. Tulp is primarily famous today for his central role in the 1632 [[:Image:Rembrandt Van Rijn, Die Anatomiestunde des Dr. Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|group portrait]] by [[Rembrandt]] of the Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons, which commemorates his appointment as [[praelector]] in 1628.

"Observationes Medicae" is also the title commonly used by early [[Dutch people|Dutch]] doctors in the 16th and 17th centuries who wrote up their cases from private practise in [[Latin]] to share with contemporary colleagues.

==Professor Tulp==
Though already well known at the time his book was written, Professor Tulp enjoyed international fame after publishing this book, and in 1652 a second edition was printed, highly unusual at that time. His book comprises 164 cases from his practise, kept in a diary from his early career onwards. His book was illustrated with plates, and it is not clear who drew these or engraved them. According to various sources, he drew many of these himself. His birth name was Claes Pietersz. He adopted the name Tulp when he had a Tulip shaped sign placed outside his door when he set up shop in Amsterdam. Many of his early patients could not read or write. He soon no longer needed to advertise his services, however, and his many duties as Praelector, and later, mayor of the city of [[Amsterdam]], prevented him from spending so much time on his practise. He published the book 5 years after the Amsterdam [[Pharmacopoeia]] was completed, which was his own personal initiative, and that helped to set intercity medical standards in the region known as the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]].

==Vondel==
Tulp had a reputation for a moral upstanding character, and [[Joost van den Vondel]] wrote poetry extolling his virtue. He later also wrote a poem in honor of the second edition of this book.&lt;ref name="Vondel"&gt;Op de Bespiegelingen der Geneeskunste Van den E. Heere, Dr. Nikolaes Tulp, Burgermeester en Raet van Amsterdam, by Joost van den Vondel,[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/vond001dewe08_01/vond001dewe08_01_0224.htm  DBNL]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earliest illustration of a Chimpanzee==
Tulp's book has various accounts of unusual illnesses and primarily growths or ''carcinomas'', but also has accounts of creatures brought back from [[Dutch East India Company]] ships. His drawing of a [[Chimpanzee]] is considered the first of its kind.&lt;ref name="uni"&gt;[[University of Amsterdam]] (2008) ''Bijzondere collecties - Aap, vis, boek - Linnaeus in de Artis Bibliotheek'', Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; This creature was called an ''Indian Satyr'', since all ships cargo was considered [[Indonesia]]n. However, the accompanying text claims the animal came from [[Angola]]. This drawing was copied many times and formed the basis for many theories on the origin of man. Most notably, Tulp's work and that of [[Jacob de Bondt]] (alias Jacobus Bontius) was copied and republished by [[Linnaeus]] to show a link between apes and man.&lt;ref name="uni"/&gt;

==Jan de Doot==
[[File:Mes-jan-de-doot.JPG|thumb|right|250px|&lt;br /&gt;Story from Prof. Tulp's book with illustration of the knife and kidney stone (publication 1740)]]
One of the interesting cases is the story of how [[Jan de Doot]] performed a bladder operation on himself.

''But this stone weighing 4 ounces and the size of a hen's egg was a wonder how it came out with the help of one hand, without the proper tools, and then from the patient himself, whose greatest help was courage and impatience embedded in a truly impenetrable faith which caused a brave deed as none other. So was he no less than those whose deeds are related in the old scriptures. Sometimes daring helps when reason doesn't.''&lt;ref name="Wolzogen"&gt;[[Nicolaes Tulp]] (1740) ''Geneeskundige Waarnemingen van Nicolaas Tulp''. Jurriaan Wishoff, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ludovicus Wolzogen==

''Observationes Medicae'' became so popular, that a hundred years later a translated version was published. Professor Tulp never wanted to publish in Dutch for fear of [[hypochondriac]] behavior. He was very against [[Quackery|quacks]] and self-medication and it was for this reason that he worked on the Amsterdam [[Pharmacopoeia]]. This second version therefore, would have been against his wishes. However, the book was prefaced by a long ''lykoratie'', or ode to his memory, in which Ludovicus Wolzogen explains what a wonderful man Tulp was, and everything that he did for the city of Amsterdam and medicine in general. He claims to have made an accurate translation from the Latin, but the flowery language is so different from Tulp's terse descriptions, that this is highly unlikely. After this edition, the number of cases went up from 164 to 251,

'''Paambadam''' is an ear ring worn by elderly women in South Indian States such as [[Tamil Nadu]] &amp; [[Kerala]].

Designed in the shape of a [[cobra|snake]] hood, with two balls, two knobs, a square piece and a tongue pieced together, the gold coated ear rings weigh about 50&amp;nbsp;g each.

Paambadam in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] means the hood of the snake(paambin padam).

The sheer weight of a paambadam enlarges the ear lobe, which has to be pierced with a special knife for gradual expression.

Paambadam would be worn with one or two others of similar size and weight, pulling down and stretching the earlobe considerably. The remarkable semi-abstract design actually incorporates animal forms, showing the head of a snake.

Currently due to more modernisation, such earrings are not worn.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}
'''Palagi''' (pronounced ''paalangi'' - ''singular'') or '''papaalagi''' (''plural'') is a term in [[Samoa]]n culture of uncertain meaning, sometimes used to describe foreigners. Tent and Geraghty (2001) comment that the origin of the Western Polynesian ''Papāalagi~Pālagi'' and the Fijian ''Vāvālagi~Pāpālagi'' remains a matter of speculation.&lt;ref name="TG"&gt;Tent, Jan and Paul Geraghty, Paul, 2001, "Exploding sky or exploded myth? The origin of Papalagi", ''Journal of the Polynesian Society'', 110, No. 2: 171-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Papāalagi~Pālagi'' is a word in the [[Samoan language]] describing non-Samoans especially European westerners or [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]]. In Samoa the term is used to describe foreigners. The word is both a [[noun]] e.g. ''a Palagi'' (European person) or an [[adjective]] e.g. ''Palagi'' house (non-traditional Samoan house). The word is a [[cognate]] in other [[Polynesian languages]] and has gained widespread use throughout much of western Polynesia, including in [[Tokelau]], [[Tuvalu]], [['Uvea]] and [[Futuna Island, Wallis and Futuna|Futuna]].

Written ''Pālagi'' or ''Papālagi'' in Samoan, and ''Papālangi'' or ''Pālangi'' in Tongan,&lt;ref name="T1"&gt;Tcherkezoff, Serge, 1999. "Who said the 17th-18th centuries paplagi/'Europeans' were 'sky-bursters'? A Eurocentric projection onto Polynesia", ''Journal of the Polynesian Society'', 108, 4: 417-425.&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''Pālagi'' is also used in [[Niuean language|Niuean]].

==Use, meaning and origin of term==
The etymology of the term ''Palagi'' is disputed. An explanation that emerged in the 19th century is that word is derived from the Polynesian rootwords "pa" (meaning: gates) and "lagi" (meaning: sky or heaven), hence the standard translation "gates of heaven"&lt;ref&gt;Stair, John B., n.d. [c. 1897]. ''Old Samoa or Flotsam and Jetsam from the Pacific Ocean'', Oxford: The Religious Tract Society.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the compound word comes from the Polynesian's reaction to seeing for the first time, European missionaries enter the country. Their skin being a different color made them think they were men sent from the gates of heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, George, 1884. ''Samoa: A Hundred Years Ago and Long Before'', London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Tcherkézoff (1999) argues that such an interpretation is a European projection to explain Polynesian cosmology.&lt;ref name=T1/&gt;

The explanation of [[Niuean language|Niuean]] word "Palagi", is that "pa" means bang such as that of a gun and "lagi" means sky, literally means bangs into the sky.  In "Papa-lagi" "papa" means more than one bang or many bangs, and "lagi" means sky.  In the olden days, Europeans who landed on [[Niue]] carried guns and often fired the guns into the sky, when they landed on the reef, to scare away potential trouble-making natives.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[Jan Tent]], a [[Macquarie University]] [[Linguistics|linguist]], and Dr. [[Paul Geraghty]], director of the [[Institute of Fijian Language and Culture]] in [[Suva]], suggest that the word may have its origins in the travels of the Polynesians themselves. They believe that the Polynesian islanders may have encountered Malay travellers prior to contact with Europeans, and adopted the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''barang'' (meaning: imported cloth). These researchers also suggest another possible etymology - the Malay word for European, as used in the 17th and 18th centuries, was ''[[Franks#Legacy|faranggi]]''. However, they discount this possibility as the word ''palangi'' seems to have originally referred to cloth; only later was the word transferred to the people.&lt;ref name=TG/&gt;

A possible alternative etymology for ''palangi'' is that is it derived from the Perso-Arabic term [[Farang|farangi]], meaning "an outsider". The extent to which Arab traders explored the Pacific Islands, or that Pacific Island communities had contact with Muslim trades remains uncertain but Arab and Persian Muslim colonies were established in Indonesia and Malaysia starting around the 10th century AD. According to an unpublished paper by Prof. Bivar of the School of Oriental and African Studies, there is some textual evidence from Arab and Persian travelogues (cf. The Journeys of [[Sinbad the Sailor|Sinbad]] in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'') for contact between Muslim traders and Pacific islands prior to European discoveries and landfalls.

== Recorded use==
[[Captain Cook]] noted the expression "''ko e vaka no papalangi''" (the boats of Papalangi) in [[Tonga]], with Cook's transcription being "Towacka no papalangie" and his translation as "cloth ships".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Beaglehole|Beaglehole, J.C.]], 1961. ''The Journals of Captain James Cook on His Voyages of Discovery'', vol.3. The Voyage of the Resolution and the Discovery 1776-1780. Cambridge p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific origin of this term remains uncertain.  The term has gained widespread use throughout much of western Polynesia including Tokelau, Tuvalu, 'Uvea and Futuna, etc., with the expansion of use of the term being though to have occurred in the 18th century when Tongans, and to lesser extent Samoans, regularly interacted with white sailors, beachcombers, convicts, missionaries, and whalers who clearly delineated ethnoracial boundaries between themselves (papalagi/papalangi) and the Polynesians they encountered.&lt;ref name=TG/&gt;&lt;ref name=T1/&gt;

The missionary [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], of the [[London Missionary Society]], records a speech in [[Samoa]], in 1830, referring to the great powers of the "papalangis".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, John, 1841. ''A Narrative of Missionary Enterprises in the South Sea Islands'', London: John Snow p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Lewis Becke|Louis Becke]] after having worked and travelled in the Pacific from 1869 to 1885 uses ''papalagi'' to mean a white person in stories&lt;ref&gt;Louis Becke, ''By Reef and Palm'' (1894) and ''The Ebbing of the Tide'' (1896) London: T. Fisher Unwin Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; set in what is now [[Tuvalu]], ''The Rangers of the Tia Kua'',&lt;ref name="R486"&gt;Readbookonline.net, entry 22486, web:[http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/22486/ ROL486].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kennedy the Boatsteerer'' in which appears "The last native girl who occupied the proud position of ''Te avaga te papalagi'' (the white man's wife) was a native of the island of Maraki";&lt;ref name="R423"&gt;Readbookonline.net, entry 22423, web: [http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/22423/ ROL423].&lt;/ref&gt; Samoa, ''A Basket of Bread-Fruit'',&lt;ref name=R486/&gt; ''At a Kava-Drinking'' in which appears "''alii papalagi'' (white gentleman)" and "this wandering ''papalagi tafea'' (beachcomber)",&lt;ref name="R425"&gt;Readbookonline.net, entry 22425, web: [http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/22425/ ROL425].&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Best Asset in a Fool’s Estate'' in which appears  “the ''papalagi mativa'' (poor white)”;&lt;ref name="R419"&gt;Readbookonline.net, entry 22419, web: [http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/22419/ ROL419].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tokelau]], ''Challis the Doubter''.&lt;ref name="R489"&gt;Readbookonline.net, entry 22489, web: [http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/22489/ ROL489].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
Largely because of the growing [[Pacific Islander]] culture in New Zealand, this word has been adopted by other Pacific cultures. Its usage in New Zealand's Pacific Islander media such as television and radio is common, and it is often used by the mainstream media to describe non-Samoans of European descent.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10510411"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=18&amp;objectid=10510411 |title=''Review'': Niu Sila at Glen Eden Playhouse |author=Simei-Barton, Paul |date=16 May 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10510825"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/4/story.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10510825&amp;pnum=0 |title=Cricket: At home, a long way from Samoa |author=Cleaver, Dylan |date=18 May 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is now also used in New Zealand in a similar way to the Māori term [[Pākehā]], but it is not restricted in referring to white people within Pacific-island surroundings. As with [[Pākehā]], Samoans and Tongans initially applied ''palagi/palangi'' and ''papalagi/papalangi'' to whites of British derivation. Today, the Samoan term "''gagana fa'a Palagi''", the Tongan term "''lea fakapālangi''" and the Tuvaluan term "faka-Pālagi" still refer to the English language specifically, even though it is understood that many ethnic Europeans who are considered "palagi" do not speak English but rather German, French, Spanish, etc. While the term is generally applied to people of European ancestry as a means of differentiation or categorization, some feel the term is derogatory, especially when aimed pointedly toward half-caste Samoans or ethnic Samoans who were born and raised in western, metropolitan societies; "''fia palagi''" and "''fie palangi''" are commonly applied to ethnic Samoans and Tongans, respectively, who are viewed as favoring the "white man's" lifestyle or culture in lieu of traditional Polynesian modes of speech, dress, housing, interpersonal relations, etc.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Tcherkezoff (1999) comments,"Europeans are still called Papālagi in today's languages. In Samoan, it is an absolutely common everyday word, not in any way a metaphoric ceremonial expression used for special circumstances or used in ''[purely]'' derogatory/laudatory ways."&lt;ref name=T1/&gt;

'''Parking guidance and information''' ('''PGI''') systems, or '''car park guidance systems''', present drivers with dynamic information on [[parking]] within controlled areas. The systems combine traffic monitoring, communication, processing and [[variable message sign]] technologies to provide the service.

Modern parking lots utilize a variety of technologies to help motorists find unoccupied parking spaces, [[car location]] when returning to the vehicle and improve their experience.  This includes adaptive lighting [[sensor]]s and parking space indicators (red for occupied, green for available and blue is reserved for the disabled; above every parking space), and [[indoor positioning system]] (IPS).

PGI systems are a product of the worldwide initiative for the development of [[intelligent transportation system]] in [[urban areas]]. PGI systems can assist in the development of safe, efficient and environmentally friendly transportation network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Traffic Advisory Leaflet ITS 4/03| work=Parking Guidance and Information | url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tpm/tal/its/parkingguidanceandinformation | accessdate = 13 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070206041939/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tpm/tal/its/parkingguidanceandinformation &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PGI systems are designed to aid in the search for vacant [[parking space]]s by directing drivers to [[car parks]] where occupancy levels are low. The objective is to reduce search time, which in turn reduces [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] on the surrounding roads for other [[traffic]] with related benefits to [[air pollution]] with the ultimate aim of enhancement of the urban area.

In all modern [[Sovereign state|states]], some land is held by central or local [[government]]s.  This is called '''public land'''.  The system of tenure of public land, and the terminology used, varies between countries.  The following examples illustrate some of the range.

==Commonwealth countries==
In several [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]], public lands are referred to as [[Crown land]]s.  Recent proposals to sell Crown lands have been highly controversial.

==France==
In [[France]],  ({{lang-fr|domaine public}}) may be held by [[Commune in France|commune]]s, ''[[département]]s'', or the central [[Sovereign state|State]].

==Portugal==
In [[Portugal]] the land owned by the State, by the two autonomous regions ([[Azores]] and [[Madeira]]) and by the local governments (municipalities ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''municípios'') and ''freguesias'') can be of two types: [[Public domain (land)|public domain]]  ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''domínio público'') and private domain ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''domínio privado''). The latter is owned like any private entity (and may be sold), while public domain land cannot be sold and it is expected to be used by the public (although it can be leased to private entities for up to 75 years in certain cases). Examples of public domain land are the margins of the sea and of the rivers, roads, streets, railways, ports, military areas, monuments. The State's private domain is managed by Direção-Geral do Tesouro e Finanças and the State's public domain is managed by various entities (state companies and state institutes, like Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente, I.P., Estradas de Portugal, E.P.E., Refer - Rede Ferroviária Portuguesa, E.P.E., APL - Administração do Porto de Lisboa, S.A., etc.).

==Israel==

===West Bank===
Public lands in [[Israel]] on the [[West Bank]] are based in the [[Ottoman Empire]] law specifying that land not worked for over ten years becomes 'state lands'. This became the base for deciding cases brought up by Arabs when certain [[Israeli settlements]] were created on presumed barren land (see [[Halamish]]).&lt;ref name="Hoberman"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hoberman | first=Haggai| year=2008| title=Keneged Kol HaSikuim | edition=1st | language=Hebrew|trans-title=Against All Odds| publisher=Sifriat Netzarim |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
[[File:US federal land.agencies.svg|350px|thumb|Map of all [[federal land|federally owned land]] in the United States.]]
[[Image:Public-Lands-Western-US.png|thumb|350px|right|Most of the public land managed by the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management is in the Western states. Public lands account for 25 to 75 percent of the total land area in these states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildlandfire.com/docs/2007/western-states-data-public-land.htm Western States Data Public Land Acreage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:US-national-forest-service-lands.png|thumb|350px|right|The US Forest Service alone manages 193 million acres (780,000 km²) nationwide, or roughly 8% of the total land area in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/land/staff/lar/2007/TABLE_4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the United States governmental entities including cities, counties, states, and the federal government all manage land which are referred to as either '''public lands''' or the [[public domain (land)|public domain]].  

The majority of public lands in the United States are held in trust for the American people by the federal government and managed by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM), the [[United States National Park Service]], the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation|Bureau of Reclamation]], or the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]] under the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], or by the [[United States Forest Service]] under the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]]. Other federal agencies that manage public lands include the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and the [[United States Department of Defense]], which includes the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42346.pdf Federal Land Ownership: Overview and Data] [[Congressional Research Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, [[United States Congress|Congress]] must legislate the creation or acquisition of new public lands, such as national parks; however, under the 1906 [[Antiquities Act]], also known as the National Monuments Act, the [[President of the United States|President]] may designate new [[U.S. National Monument|national monuments]] without congressional authorization if the monument is on federally-owned land.

Each western state also received federal "public land" as trust lands designated for specific beneficiaries, which the States are to manage as a condition to acceptance into the union. Those trust lands cannot any longer be considered public lands as allowing any benefits to the "public" would be in breach of loyalty to the specific beneficiaries.  The trust lands (two sections, or about {{convert|1280|acre|km2}} per [[Township (United States)|township]]) are usually managed extractively (grazing or mining), to provide revenue for public schools. All states have some lands under state management, such as [[state park]]s, state wildlife management areas, and [[state forest]]s. 

[[Wilderness]] is a special designation for public lands which have been completely undeveloped. The concept of wilderness areas was legislatively defined by the 1964 Wilderness Act.  Wilderness areas can be managed by any of the above Federal agencies, and some parks and refuges are almost entirely designated wilderness. A wilderness study area is a tract of land that has wilderness characteristics, and is managed as wilderness, but has not received a wilderness designation from Congress. 

Typically each parcel is governed by its own set of laws and rules that explain the purpose for which the land was acquired, and how the land may be used. 

===History===
The concept of a formal designation and conservation of public lands dates back to our first National Parks. While designating the parks as public, the conservation was another matter. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his conservation group, [[Boone and Crockett Club]] took matters into their own hands, by creating laws and regulations that protected these national treasures. Roosevelt and the [[Boone and Crockett Club]] continued on influencing the creation of scores of public lands including the [[National Refuge System]], [[USFS]] and the [[United States National Forest]] system.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

===Recreation on U.S. public lands===
Most state- and federally managed public lands are open for recreational use. Recreation opportunities depend on the managing agency, and run the gamut from the less restrictive, undeveloped wide open spaces of BLM lands to the highly developed and controlled national and state parks. Wildlife refuges and state wildlife management areas, managed primarily to improve [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], are generally open to wildlife watching, hiking, and hunting, except for closures to protect mating and nesting, or to reduce stress on wintering animals. National forests generally have a mix of maintained trails and roads, wilderness and undeveloped portions, and developed picnic and camping areas.

===Grazing on U.S. public lands===
Historically in the western United States, much public land is leased for grazing by cattle or sheep (most National Park Service areas are closed to livestock grazing). This includes vast tracts of National Forest and BLM land, as well as land on some Wildlife Refuges. National Parks are the exception. This use became controversial in the late 20th century as it was examined by environmentalists and scientists concerned about the impact of these exotic animals on native plant populations and watersheds.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 14-73, "The Public Lands Debate", Sharman Apt Russell, ''Kill the Cowboy: A Battle of Mythology in the New West'', Addison-Wesley (May, 1993), hardcover, 218 pages, {{ISBN|0-201-58123-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil and gas drilling and mining on U.S. public lands===
Large tracts of public land in the United States are available for leasing for petroleum or mineral production. Lands which have a high likelihood of producing valuable resources can, as of 2018, command prices as high as $80,000 an acre per year. Large tracts of other lands, where the likelihood of the presence or successful exploitation of resources are very low, could be leased, as of 2018, for as low as $1.50 an acre per year. The [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] greatly expanded mineral leasing resulting in a substantial increase in fracking in likely locations in Wyoming and New Mexico,&lt;ref name="NYT112718"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Eric Lipton |author2=Hiroko Tabuchi |title=Driven by Trump Policy Changes, Fracking Booms on Public Lands |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/climate/trump-fracking-drilling-oil-gas.html |accessdate=November 27, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a great deal of land where prospects for successful production was very low was leased at very low rates to speculators.&lt;ref name="NYT112718a"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Eric Lipton |author2=Hiroko Tabuchi |title=Energy Speculators Jump on Chance to Lease Public Land at Bargain Rates |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/business/energy-speculators-public-land-leases.html |accessdate=November 27, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Alternative medical systems|general}}
'''Quackery''', often synonymous with '''health fraud''', is the promotion&lt;ref name="Barrett2009" /&gt; of fraudulent or ignorant [[medicine|medical practices]].  A '''quack''' is a "fraudulent or ignorant pretender to medical skill" or "a person who pretends, professionally or publicly, to have skill, knowledge, qualification or credentials they do not possess; a [[charlatan]] or [[snake oil]] salesman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|quack|accessdate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''quack'' is a [[Clipping (morphology)|clipped form]] of the archaic term ''{{linktext|quacksalver}}'', from {{lang-nl|kwakzalver}} a "hawker of salve".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|quack|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]] the term ''quack'' meant "shouting". The quacksalvers sold their wares on the market shouting in a loud voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German-English glossary of idioms|website=accurapid.com|location=Poughkeepsie, New York|publisher=Accurapid|url=http://accurapid.com/journal/german-glossary.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204150028/http://www.accurapid.com/journal/german-glossary.htm|archivedate=2010-12-04|deadurl=yes|at=quacksalber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common elements of general quackery include [[List of questionable diseases|questionable diagnoses]] using [[List of questionable diagnostic tests|questionable diagnostic tests]], as well as untested or refuted treatments, especially for serious diseases such as [[alternative cancer treatments|cancer]]. Quackery is often described as "health fraud" with the salient characteristic of aggressive promotion.&lt;ref name="Barrett2009" /&gt;

Since it is difficult to distinguish between those who knowingly promote unproven medical therapies and those who are mistaken as to their effectiveness, United States courts have ruled in [[defamation]] cases that accusing someone of quackery or calling a practitioner a ''quack'' is not equivalent to accusing that person of committing medical fraud. To be both quackery and fraud, the quack must know they are misrepresenting the benefits and risks of the medical services offered (instead of, for example, promoting an ineffective product they honestly believe is effective).{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

In addition to the ethical problems of promising benefits that can not reasonably be expected to occur, quackery also includes the risk that patients may choose to forego treatments that are more likely to help them, in favor of ineffective treatments given by the "quack".&lt;ref name=Tabish2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tabish|first=Syed Amin|date=January 2008|title=Complementary and alternative healthcare: is it evidence-based?|journal=International Journal of Health Sciences|volume=2|issue=1|location=Qassim, SA|publisher=Qassim University|pages=v–ix|pmc=3068720|issn=1658-3639|pmid=21475465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Angell1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angell|first1=Marcia|last2=Kassirer|first2=Jerome P.|title=Alternative Medicine – The Risks of Untested and Unregulated Remedies|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=17 September 1998|volume=339|issue=12|pages=839–41|doi=10.1056/NEJM199809173391210|pmid=9738094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cassileth2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassileth|first1=Barrie R.|last2=Yarett|first2=I.R.|title=Cancer quackery: the persistent popularity of useless, irrational 'alternative' treatments.|journal=Oncology|date=2012|volume=28|issue=8|pages=754–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Barrett]] of [[Quackwatch]] defines quackery "as the promotion of unsubstantiated methods that lack a scientifically plausible rationale" and more broadly as:

{{Quote|"anything involving overpromotion in the field of health."

== Quacksalver ==

Unproven, usually ineffective, and sometimes dangerous medicines and treatments have been peddled throughout human history. Theatrical performances were sometimes given to enhance the credibility of purported medicines. Grandiose claims were made for what could be humble materials indeed: for example, in the mid-19th century ''[[revalenta arabica]]'' was advertised as having extraordinary restorative virtues as an empirical diet for invalids; despite its impressive name and many glowing testimonials it was in truth only ordinary [[lentil]] flour, sold to the gullible at many times the true cost.

Even where no fraud was intended, quack remedies often contained no effective ingredients whatsoever. Some remedies contained substances such as [[opium]], alcohol and honey, which would have given symptomatic relief but had no curative properties. Some would have [[Addiction|addictive]] qualities to entice the buyer to return. The few effective remedies sold by quacks included emetics, laxatives and diuretics. Some ingredients did have medicinal effects: [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[silver]] and [[arsenic]] compounds may have helped some infections and infestations; [[willow]] [[Bark (botany)|bark]] contained [[salicylic acid]], chemically closely related to [[aspirin]]; and the [[quinine]] contained in [[Jesuit's bark]] was an effective treatment for [[malaria]] and other fevers. However, knowledge of appropriate uses and dosages was limited.

== Criticism of quackery in academia ==

The [[science-based medicine]] community has criticized the infiltration of [[alternative medicine]] into mainstream academic medicine, education, and publications, accusing institutions of "diverting research time, money, and other resources from more fruitful lines of investigation in order to pursue a theory that has no basis in biology."&lt;ref name="Gorski2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorski|first=David|date=2010-08-03|title=Credulity about acupuncture infiltrates the ''New England Journal of Medicine''{{thinsp}}|website=sciencebasedmedicine.org|location=|publisher=Science-Based Medicine|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6381|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210043145/http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6381|archivedate=2010-12-10|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novella |first=Steven|author-link=Steven Novella|date=2010-08-04|title=Acupuncture pseudoscience in the ''New England Journal of Medicine''{{thinsp}}|website=sciencebasedmedicine.org|location=|publisher=Science-Based Medicine|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6391|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807053720/http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6391|archivedate=2010-08-07|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; R.W. Donnell coined the phrase "quackademic medicine" to describe this attention given to alternative medicine by academia. Referring to the [[Flexner Report]], he said that medical education "needs a good [[Flexnerian medicine|Flexnerian]] housecleaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donnell|first=Robert W.|date=|title=Exposing quackery in medical education|website=doctorrw.blogspot.com|type=blog|location=|publisher=|url=http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2008/01/exposing-quackery-in-medical-education.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205235450/http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2008/01/exposing-quackery-in-medical-education.html|archivedate=2008-02-05|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[David Gorski]] criticized [[Brian M. Berman]], founder of the University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine, for writing that "There [is] evidence that both real acupuncture and sham acupuncture [are] more effective than no treatment and that acupuncture can be a useful supplement to other forms of conventional therapy for low back pain." He also castigated editors and peer reviewers at the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' for allowing it to be published, since it effectively recommended deliberately misleading patients in order to achieve a known placebo effect.&lt;ref name="Gorski2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Brian M.|last2=Langevin|first2=Helene M.|authorlink2=Helene Langevin|last3=Witt|first3=Claudia M.|last4=Dubner|first4=Ronald|date=2010-07-29|title=Acupuncture for chronic low back pain|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=363|issue=5|location=|publisher=|pages=454–61|doi=10.1056/NEJMct0806114|pmid=20818865}} Correction of an author name in {{cite journal|date=2010-08-26|title=Acupuncture for chronic low back pain|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=363|issue=9|page=893|doi=10.1056/NEJMx100048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History in Europe and the United States ==

With little understanding of the causes and mechanisms of illnesses, widely marketed "cures" (as opposed to locally produced and locally used remedies), often referred to as [[patent medicine]]s, first came to prominence during the 17th and 18th centuries in Britain and the British colonies, including those in North America. [[Daffy's Elixir]] and [[Turlington's Balsam]] were among the first products that used branding (e.g. using highly distinctive containers) and mass marketing to create and maintain markets.&lt;ref name="Styles2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Styles|first=John|year=2000|title=Product innovation in early modern London|journal=Past &amp; Present|volume=168|issue=1|location=|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=124–69|doi=10.1093/past/168.1.124}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar process occurred in other countries of Europe around the same time, for example with the marketing of [[Eau de Cologne]] as a cure-all medicine by [[Johann Maria Farina]] and his imitators. Patent medicines often contained [[alcohol]] or [[opium]], which, while presumably not curing the diseases for which they were sold as a remedy, did make the imbibers feel better and confusedly appreciative of the product.

The number of internationally marketed quack medicines increased in the later 18th century; the majority of them originated in Britain&lt;ref name="GriffenhagenYoung1959"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffenhagen|first1=George B.|last2=Young|first2=James Harvey|year=1959|orig-year=first published in 1929|title=Old English patent medicines in America|series=Contributions from the museum of history and technology|volume=10|location=[Washington, DC]|publisher=[Smithsonian Institution]|id=Project Gutenberg, 30162|oclc=746980411|pages=155–83|publication-date=2009|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30162|via=Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were exported throughout the British Empire.

A [[Netherlands|Dutch]] organisation that opposes quackery, ''{{lang|nl|[[Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij]]}}'' (VtdK) was founded in 1881, making it the oldest organisation of this kind in the world.&lt;ref name="Lewis2009"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Andy|date=3 August 2009 |title=Dutch sceptics have 'bogus' libel decision overturned on human rights grounds|website=quackometer.net|type=blog|location=|publisher=Andy Lewis|url=http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/08/dutch-sceptics-have-bogus-libel.html|access-date=2014-05-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213174338/http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/08/dutch-sceptics-have-bogus-libel.html|archivedate=2014-02-13|deadurl=no}} {{Self-published source|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has published its magazine ''{{lang|nl|Nederlands Tijdschrift tegen de Kwakzalverij}}'' (''Dutch Magazine against Quackery'') ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=De Kort|first=Marcel|year=1995|title=Tussen patient en delinquent: geschiedenis van het Nederlandse drugsbeleid|language=nl|trans-title=Between patient and delinquent: the history of drug policy in the Netherlands|series=Publikaties van de Faculteit der Historische en Kunstwetenschappen|volume=19|location=Hilversum|publisher=Verloren|isbn=9789065504203|pages=25–26|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these early years the {{abbr|VtdK|Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij}} played a part in the professionalisation of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=De Kort|first=Marcel|year=1993|chapter=Drug policy: medical or crime control?

In 1909, in an attempt to stop the sale of quack medicines, the [[British Medical Association]] published ''Secret Remedies, What They Cost And What They Contain''.&lt;ref name="BMA1909"&gt;{{cite book|author=British Medical Journal|year=1909|title=Secret remedies, what they cost and what they contain|location=London|publisher=British medical association|oclc=807108391|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.b5254294}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The British Medical Association estimated that, based on [[Ad valorem tax|''ad valorem'' tax]] revenues from patent medicines for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1908, the British public spent about £{{Format price|2422800}} on patent medicines.&lt;ref name="BMA1909" /&gt;{{rp|pages=182–84}} This is equivalent to about £{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|2422800|1908|2014}}}} (${{Format price|{{To USD|{{Inflation|UK|2422800|1908|2014}}|GBR}}}}) in 2014.{{Inflation-fn|UK}}}} This publication was originally a series of articles published in the ''British Medical Journal'' between 1904 and 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Composition of Certain Secret Remedies: I.-Some Remedies for Epilepsy.|journal=British Journal of Medicine|date=Dec 10, 1904|volume=2|issue=2293|pages=1585–86|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.2293.1585}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was composed of 20 chapters, organising the work by sections according to the ailments the medicines claimed to treat. Each remedy was tested thoroughly, the preface stated: "Of the accuracy of the analytical data there can be no question; the investigation has been carried out with great care by a skilled analytical chemist."&lt;ref name="BMA1909" /&gt;{{rp|at=vi}} The book did lead to the end of some of the quack cures, but some survived the book by several decades. For example, [[Beecham's Pills]], which according to the British Medical Association contained in 1909 only aloes, ginger and soap, but claimed to cure 31 medical conditions,&lt;ref name="BMA1909" /&gt;{{rp|page=175}} were sold until 1998.

British patent medicines lost their dominance in the United States when they were denied access to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] markets during the [[American Revolution]], and lost further ground for the same reason during the [[War of 1812]]. From the early 19th century "home-grown" American brands started to fill the gap, reaching their peak in the years after the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="GriffenhagenYoung1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Young1961"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=James H.|year=1961|title=The toadstool millionaires: a social history of patent medicines in America before federal regulation|location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press|oclc=599159278|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/13Hx/MM/00.html|via=quackwatch.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021010055456/http://www.quackwatch.org/13Hx/MM/00.html|archivedate=2002-10-10|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; British medicines never regained their previous dominance in North America, and the subsequent era of mass marketing of American [[patent medicine]]s is usually considered to have been a "golden age" of quackery in the United States. This was mirrored by similar growth in marketing of quack medicines elsewhere in the world.

[[File:Clark Stanley's Snake Oil Liniment.png|thumb|right|Clark Stanley's Snake Oil]]
In the United States, false medicines in this era were often denoted by the slang term [[snake oil]], a reference to sales pitches for the false medicines that claimed exotic ingredients provided the supposed benefits. Those who sold them were called "snake oil salesmen," and usually sold their medicines with a fervent pitch similar to a [[fire and brimstone]] religious sermon. They often accompanied other theatrical and entertainment productions that traveled as a road show from town to town, leaving quickly before the falseness of their medicine was discovered. Not all quacks were restricted to such small-time businesses however, and a number, especially in the United States, became enormously wealthy through national and international sales of their products.

In 1875, the ''[[Pacific Medical and Surgical Journal]]'' complained: {{quotation|If Satan has ever succeeded in compressing a greater amount of concentrated mendacity into one set of human bodies above every other description, it is in the advertising quacks. The coolness and deliberation with which they announce the most glaring falsehoods are really appalling. A recent arrival in San Francisco, whose name might indicate that he had his origin in the Pontine marshes of Europe, announces himself as the "Late examining physician of the Massachusetts Infirmary, Boston." This fellow has the impudence to publish that his charge to physicians in their own cases is $5.00! Another genius in Philadelphia, of the bogus diploma breed, who claims to have founded a new system of practice and who calls himself a "Professor," advertises two elixers of his own make, one of which is for "all male diseases" and the other for "all female diseases"! In the list of preparations which this wretch advertises for sale as the result of his own labors and discoveries, is ''ozone''! |''[[Pacific Medical and Surgical Journal]]'', reprinted in the ''[[Boston Medical And Surgical Journal]]'', vol. 91, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tT0BAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA373 p. 373]}}

One among many examples is William Radam, a German immigrant to the USA, who, in the 1880s, started to sell his "Microbe Killer" throughout the United States and, soon afterwards, in Britain and throughout the British colonies. His concoction was widely advertised as being able to "cure all diseases",&lt;ref name="Radam1895"&gt;{{cite book|last=Radam|first=William|year=1895|orig-year=1890|title=Microbes and the microbe killer|edition=Rev.|location=New York|publisher=The author|oclc=768310771|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc2.ark:/13960/t9862f811?urlappend=%3Bseq=207|pages=137, 180, 205|quote=I offer to cure all diseases with but one remedy, and to stop children dying of disease, for of course I cannot prevent accidents in all cases that are taken in time, and where my instructions are faithfully followed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this phrase was even embossed on the glass bottles the medicine was sold in. In fact, Radam's medicine was a therapeutically useless (and in large quantities actively poisonous) dilute solution of [[sulfuric acid]], coloured with a little red [[wine]].&lt;ref name="Young1961" /&gt; Radam's publicity material, particularly his books,&lt;ref name="Radam1895" /&gt; provide an insight into the role that [[pseudoscience]] played in the development and marketing of "quack" medicines towards the end of the 19th century.

"Dr." Sibley, an English patent medicine seller of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, even went so far as to claim that his Reanimating Solar Tincture would, as the name implies, "restore life in the event of sudden death". Another English quack, "Dr. Solomon" claimed that his Cordial Balm of Gilead cured almost anything, but was particularly effective against all venereal complaints, from [[gonorrhoea]] to [[onanism]].

Not all patent medicines were without merit. Turlingtons Balsam of Life, first marketed in the mid-18th century, did have genuinely beneficial properties. This medicine continued to be sold under the original name into the early 20th century, and can still be found in the British and American [[pharmacopoeia]]s as "Compound [[tincture of benzoin]]". In these cases, the treatments likely lacked empirical support when they were introduced to the market, and their benefits were simply a convenient coincidence discovered after the fact.

The end of the road for the quack medicines now considered grossly fraudulent in the nations of North America and Europe came in the early 20th century. February 21, 1906 saw the passage into law of the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] in the United States. This was the result of decades of campaigning by both government departments and the medical establishment, supported by a number of publishers and journalists (one of the most effective was [[Samuel Hopkins Adams]], who wrote "The Great American Fraud" series in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1905).&lt;ref name="Adams1912"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Samuel Hopkins|year=1912|orig-year=1905|title=The great American fraud: articles on the nostrum evil and quackery reprinted from ''Collier's''|edition=5th|location=Chicago|publisher=American Medical Association|oclc=894099555|url=https://archive.org/details/greatamericanfra00adamuoft/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This American Act was followed three years later by similar legislation in Britain and in other European nations. Between them, these laws began to remove the more outrageously dangerous contents from patent and proprietary medicines, and to force quack medicine proprietors to stop making some of their more blatantly dishonest claims.

"Medical quackery and promotion of nostrums and worthless drugs were among the most prominent abuses that led to formal self-regulation in business and, in turn, to the creation of the" [[Better Business Bureau]].&lt;ref name="Ladimer1965"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladimer|first=Irving|date=August 1965|title=The Health Advertising Program of the National Better Business Bureau|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=55|issue=8|location=|publisher=|pmc=1256406|issn=|pmid=14326419|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1256406&amp;blobtype=pdf|pages=1217–27|doi=10.2105/ajph.55.8.1217}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=1217}}

Quackery continues even today; it can be found in any culture and in every medical tradition. Unlike other advertising mediums, rapid advancements in communication through the Internet have opened doors for an unregulated market of quack cures and marketing campaigns rivaling the early 20th century. Most people with an [[e-mail]] account have experienced the marketing tactics of [[spamming]]&amp;nbsp;– in which modern forms of quackery are touted as miraculous remedies for "weight loss" and "sexual enhancement", as well as outlets for medicines of unknown quality.

While quackery is often aimed at the aged or chronically ill, it can be aimed at all age groups, including teens, and the FDA has mentioned&lt;ref name=FDA_Teens&gt;{{cite web|author1=Food and Drug Administration|author2=Council of Better Business Bureaus|date=April 1990|orig-year=February 1988|title=Quackery targets teens|website=cfsan.fda.gov|location=Washington, DC|publisher=Department of Health and Human Services.

In 1992, the president of [[The National Council Against Health Fraud]], William T. Jarvis, wrote in ''[[Clinical Chemistry (journal)|Clinical Chemistry]]'' that:

{{quote|The U.S. Congress determined quackery to be the most harmful consumer fraud against elderly people. Americans waste $27 billion annually on questionable health care, exceeding the amount spent on biomedical research. Quackery is characterized by the promotion of false and unproven health schemes for profit and does not necessarily involve imposture, fraud, or greed. The real issues in the war against quackery are the principles, including scientific rationale, encoded into consumer protection laws, primarily the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. More such laws are badly needed. Regulators are failing the public by enforcing laws inadequately, applying double standards, and accrediting pseudomedicine. Non-scientific health care (e.g., acupuncture, ayurvedic medicine, chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy) is licensed by individual states. Practitioners use unscientific practices and deception on a public who, lacking complex health-care knowledge, must rely upon the trustworthiness of providers. Quackery not only harms people, it undermines the scientific enterprise and should be actively opposed by every scientist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1643742 |date=August 1992 |last1=Jarvis |first1=WT |title=Quackery: a national scandal |volume=38 |issue=8B Pt 2 |pages=1574–86 |issn=0009-9147 |journal=Clinical Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For those in the practice of any medicine, to allege quackery is to level a serious objection to a particular form of practice. Most developed countries have a governmental agency, such as the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in the US, whose purpose is to monitor and regulate the safety of medications as well as the claims made by the manufacturers of new and existing products, including drugs and nutritional supplements or vitamins. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) participates in some of these efforts.&lt;ref name=FTC&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1999/06/opcureall.shtmh |title="Operation Cure.all" Targets Internet Health Fraud |date=June 24, 1999 |publisher=[[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To better address less regulated products, in 2000, US President Clinton signed Executive Order 13147 that created the White House Commission on [[Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. In 2002, the commission's final report made several suggestions regarding education, research, implementation, and reimbursement as ways to evaluate the risks and benefits of each.&lt;ref name="WHCCAMP2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy|date=March 2002|title=Final report|series=NIH publication|volume=03-5411|location=Washington, DC|publisher=United States.

Individuals and non-governmental agencies are active in attempts to expose quackery. According to [[John C. Norcross]] et al. less is consensus about ineffective "compared to effective procedures" but identifying both "pseudoscientific, unvalidated, or 'quack' psychotherapies" and "assessment measures of questionable validity on psycho-metric grounds" was pursued by various authors.&lt;ref name="Norcross2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norcross|first1=John C.|last2=Koocher|first2=Gerald P.|last3=Garofalo|first3=Ariele|date=Oct 2006|title=Discredited psychological treatments and tests: a Delphi poll|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|volume=37|issue=5|location=|publisher=American Psychological Association|pages=515–22|doi=10.1037/0735-7028.37.5.515|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=515}} The [[evidence-based practice]] (EBP) movement in mental health emphasizes the consensus in psychology that psychological practice should rely on empirical research.&lt;ref name="Norcross2006" /&gt;{{rp|pages=515, 522}} There are also "anti-quackery" websites, such as [[Quackwatch]], that help consumers evaluate claims.&lt;ref name="Baldwin2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baldwin|first=Fred D.|date=2004-07-19|title=If it quacks like a duck...|website=medhunters.com|location=[s.l.]|publisher=MedHunters|url=http://www.medhunters.com/articles/ifItQuacksLikeADuck.html|access-date=2007-10-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206060833/http://www.medhunters.com/articles/ifItQuacksLikeADuck.html|archivedate=2008-02-06|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quackwatch's information is relevant to both consumers and medical professionals.&lt;ref name="ascp"&gt;{{cite news|first=Bao-Anh |last=Nguyen-Khoa |title=Selected Web Site Reviews – Quackwatch.com |url=http://www.ascp.com/publications/tcp/1999/jul/access.shtml |publisher=[[American Society of Consultant Pharmacists|The Consultant Pharmacist]] |date=July 1999 |accessdate=2007-01-25 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214172021/http://www.ascp.com/publications/tcp/1999/jul/access.shtml |archivedate=December 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People's Republic of China ===

Zhang Wuben, a quack who posed as skilled in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] in the [[People's Republic of China]], based his operation on representations that raw eggplant and mung beans were a general cure-all. Zhang, who has escaped legal liability as he portrayed himself as a nutritionist, not a doctor, appeared on television in China and authored a best-selling book, ''Eat Away the Diseases You Get from Eating''. Zhang, who charged the equivalent of $450 for a 10-minute examination, had a two-year waiting list when he was exposed. Investigations launched after a run on mung beans revealed that contrary to his representations, he did not come from a family of accomplished traditional practitioners (中医世家) and never had the medical degree from [[Beijing Medical University]] he claimed to have. His only education was a brief correspondence or night school course, completed after he was laid off from a textile factory.

There have been several suggested reasons why quackery is accepted by patients in spite of its lack of effectiveness:
* Ignorance
: Those who perpetuate quackery may do so to take advantage of ignorance about conventional medical treatments versus alternative treatments, or may themselves be ignorant regarding their own claims. Mainstream medicine has produced many remarkable advances, so people may tend to also believe groundless claims.
* [[Placebo effect]]
: Medicines or treatments known to have no pharmacological effect on a disease can still affect a person's perception of their illness, and this belief in its turn does indeed sometimes have a therapeutic effect, causing the patient's condition to improve. This is ''not'' to say that no real cure of biological illness is effected – "though we might describe a placebo effect as being 'all in the mind', we now know that there is a genuine neurobiological basis to this phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Benedetti|first=Fabrizio | title=Placebo effects: understanding the mechanisms in health and disease | publisher = Oxford University Press 2009 | location =  | isbn = 978-0-19-955912-1 | at = back cover }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{irrelevant citation|date=November 2015|reason=The term quack does not appear in a Google books search within the book (books.google.com/books?id=co8oAQAAMAAJ)}} People report reduced pain, increased well-being, improvement, or even total alleviation of symptoms. For some, the presence of a caring practitioner and the dispensation of medicine is curative in itself.
* [[Regression fallacy]]
: Lack of understanding that health conditions change with no treatment and attributing changes in ailments to a given therapy.&lt;ref name=Butler2011&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Thomas Butler|title=Consumer Health: Making Informed Decisions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoWT6NqDFyMC&amp;pg=PA64|date=1 July 2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-0-7637-9340-1|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Confirmation bias]]
: Also called [[myside bias]], is the tendency to search for, interpret, or prioritize information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of [[cognitive bias]] and a systematic error of [[inductive reasoning]].
* Distrust of conventional medicine
: Many people, for various reasons, have a [[distrust]] of conventional medicine, or of the regulating organizations such as the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], or the major drug corporations. For example, "[[Complementary and Alternative Medicine|CAM]] may represent a response to disenfranchisement [discrimination] in conventional medical settings and resulting distrust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shippee, Tetyana|author2=Henning-Smith, Carrie|author3=Shippee, Nathan|author4=Kemmick Pintor, Jessie|author5=Call, Kathleen T.|author6=McAlpine, Donna|author7=Johnson, Pamela Jo|year=2013|title=Discrimination in Medical Settings and Attitudes toward Complementary and Alternative Medicine: The Role of Distrust in Conventional Providers|journal=Journal of Health Disparities Research and Practice|volume=6|issue=1|page=3|url=http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/jhdrp/vol6/iss1/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]]
: Anti-quackery activists ("quackbusters") are often falsely accused of being part of a huge "conspiracy" to suppress "unconventional" and/or "natural" therapies, as well as those who promote them. It is alleged that this conspiracy is backed and funded by the pharmaceutical industry and the established medical care system – represented by the [[American Medical Association|AMA]], [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], [[American Dental Association|ADA]], [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], etc. – for the purpose of preserving their power and increasing their profits. This idea is often held by people with [[Antiscience]] views.
* Fear of [[Adverse effect|side effects]]
: A great variety of [[pharmaceutical medications]] can have very distressing side effects, and many people fear [[surgery]] and its consequences, so they may opt to shy away from these mainstream treatments.
* Cost
: There are some people who simply cannot afford conventional treatment, and seek out a cheaper alternative. Nonconventional practitioners can often dispense treatment at a much lower cost. This is compounded by [[Health equity#Disparities in access to health care|reduced access to healthcare]].
* Desperation
: People with a serious or terminal disease, or who have been told by their practitioner that their condition is "untreatable," may react by seeking out treatment, disregarding the lack of scientific proof for its effectiveness, or even the existence of evidence that the method is ineffective or even dangerous. Despair may be exacerbated by the lack of [[palliative care|palliative non-curative]] [[end-of-life care]].  Between 2012 and 2018 appeals on UK crowdfunding sites for cancer treatment with an alternative health element have raised £8 million. This is described as "a new and lucrative revenue stream for cranks, charlatans, and conmen who prey on the vulnerable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is cancer fundraising fuelling quackery? |url=https://www.bmj.com/content/362/bmj.k3829.full |accessdate=19 October 2018 |publisher=British Medical Journal |date=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pride
: Once people have endorsed or defended a cure, or invested time and money in it, they may be reluctant or embarrassed to admit its ineffectiveness and therefore recommend a treatment that does not work.
* Fraud
: Some practitioners, fully aware of the ineffectiveness of their medicine, may intentionally produce fraudulent scientific studies and medical test results, thereby confusing any potential consumers as to the effectiveness of the medical treatment.

It was alleged in the information that the article was misbranded in that certain statements, designs, and devices regarding the therapeutic and curative effects of the article, appearing on the bottle label, falsely and fraudulently represented that it would be effective as a treatment, remedy, and cure for pneumonia, coughs, weak lungs, asthma, kidney, liver, bladder, or any stomach troubles, and effective as a great blood and nerve tonic."

* '''[[Wilhelm Reich]]''' (1897–1957), Austrian-American Psychoanalyst. Claimed that he had discovered a primordial cosmic energy called [[Orgone]]. He developed several devices, including the [[Cloudbuster]] and the [[Orgone Accumulator]], that he believed could use orgone to manipulate the weather, battle space aliens and cure diseases, including cancer. After an investigation, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] concluded that they were dealing with a "fraud of the first magnitude". On February 10, 1954, the U.S. Attorney for Maine filed a complaint seeking a permanent injunction under Sections 301 and 302 of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], to prevent interstate shipment of orgone accumulators and to ban some of Reich's writing promoting and advertising the devices. Reich refused to appear in court, arguing that no court was in a position to evaluate his work. Reich was arrested for [[contempt of court]], and convicted to 2 years in jail, a $10,000 fine, and his Orgone Accumulators and work on Orgone were ordered to be destroyed. On August 23, 1956, six tons of his books, journals, and papers were burned in the 25th Street public incinerator in New York. On March 12, 1957 he was sent to [[Danbury Federal Prison]], where Richard C. Hubbard, a psychiatrist who admired Reich, examined him, recording [[paranoia]] manifested by delusions of grandiosity, persecution, and ideas of reference. On November 18, 1957 Reich died of a [[heart attack]] 9 months later while he was in the federal penitentiary in [[United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg|Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]].

* Viewing child pornography increases the likelihood of an individual committing child sexual abuse.  Reasons include that the pornography normalizes and/or legitimizes the sexual interest in children, as well as that pornography might eventually cease to satisfy the user&lt;!-- citation needed. --&gt;.
* Viewing child pornography decreases the likelihood of an individual committing child sexual abuse. Reasons are that the pornography acts as a substitute for actual offenses.

* There is no correlation between viewing child pornography and acts of child sexual abuse, or that available evidence is insufficient to draw any conclusions at all.

==Views on increasing criminal sexual intent==

===General===
One perspective is that exposure to [[child pornography]] promotes criminal sexual intent that otherwise would not exist. The promotion may take place via material that legitimizes sexual interest in minors. Anonymity (or belief that anonymity exists) may further loosen the internal restraints, facilitated by still or moving images, which makes actual criminal sexual behavior with children more probable if the person was already sexually motivated toward children, or, by creating new sexual interests in children. A review article states that these are plausible hypotheses,&lt;ref name="Onlinepred"/&gt; but that there is a lack of clarity as to the general applicability of these mechanisms. The authors also note that, "among some groups of predisposed individuals, easy access to a wide variety of engrossing and high-quality child pornography could serve as a substitute for involvement with actual victims".&lt;ref name="Onlinepred"/&gt;

According to the National District Attorneys Association of America, "In light of the documented link between individuals who view child pornography and individuals who actually molest children, each child pornography case should be viewed as a red flag to the possibility of actual child molestation."&lt;ref name=NDAA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndaa.org/publications/newsletters/child_sexual_exploitation_update_volume_1_number_3_2004.html |title=From Fantasy to Reality: The Link Between Viewing Child Pornography and Molesting Children |accessdate=2008-05-03 |work=Child Sexual Exploitation Update - Volume 1, Number 3, 2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111204617/http://www.ndaa.org/publications/newsletters/child_sexual_exploitation_update_volume_1_number_3_2004.html |archivedate = 2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Carr, founding member of the United Kingdom Home Secretary’s Internet Task Force on Child Protection, in a report published by the [[Action for Children|NCH]] stated, "Many pedophiles acknowledge that exposure to child abuse images fuels their sexual fantasies and plays an important part in leading them to commit hands-on sexual offenses against children."&lt;ref name="Carr 2004"/&gt;

===Research===
A 1987 report by the U.S.A. [[National Institute of Justice]] described "a disturbing correlation" between traders of child pornography and acts of [[Child sexual abuse|child molestation]].&lt;ref name=NCJRS&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks of Arnold I Burns Before the Florida Law Enforcement Committee on Obscenity, Organized Crime and Child Pornography |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=109133 |publisher=National Institute of Justice |work=NCJ 109133 |date=1987-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 [[longitudinal study]] of 341 convicted child molesters in America found that pornography's use correlated significantly with their rate of sexually re-offending. Frequency of pornography use was primarily a further risk factor for higher-risk offenders, when compared with lower-risk offenders, and use of highly deviant pornography correlated with increased [[recidivism]] risk for all groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kingston DA, etal |title=Pornography use and sexual aggression: the impact of frequency and type of pornography use on recidivism among sexual offenders.|journal= Aggress Behav|year=2008|issue=34|pmid=18307171|pages=1–11|doi=10.1002/ab.20250|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of men who have been charged with or convicted of child pornography offenses show pedophilic profiles on [[phallometric testing]].&lt;ref&gt;Seto, M. C., Cantor, J. M., &amp; Blanchard, R. (2006). Child pornography offenses are a valid diagnostic indicator of pedophilia. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 115,'' U.S.A. 610–615.&lt;/ref&gt; A study with a sample of 201 adult male child pornography offenders using police databases examined charges or convictions after the index child pornography offense(s). 56% of the sample had a prior criminal record, 24% had prior contact sexual offenses, and 15% had prior child pornography offenses. One-third were concurrently charged with other crimes at the time they were charged for child pornography offenses. 17% of the sample offended again in some way during this time, and 4% committed a new contact sexual offense. Child pornography offenders with prior criminal records were significantly more likely to offend again in any way during the follow-up period. Child pornography offenders who had committed a prior or concurrent contact sexual offense were the most likely to offend again, either generally or sexually.&lt;ref&gt;Seto, M. C., &amp; Eke, A. W. (2005). The criminal histories and later offending of child pornography offenders. ''Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 17,'' 201–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Mayo Clinic]] of the U.S.A., studies and case reports indicate that 30% to 80% of individuals who viewed child pornography and 76% of individuals who were arrested for Internet child pornography had molested a child; however, they state that it is difficult to know how many people progress from computerized child pornography to physical acts against children and how many would have progressed to physical acts without the computer being involved.&lt;ref name="mayoclinic04_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf%2F8204%2F8204sa.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Profile of Pedophilia: Definition, Characteristics of Offenders, Recidivism, Treatment Outcomes, and Forensic Issues |author=RYAN C. W. HALL; RICHARD C. W. HALL |journal=Mayo Clin Proc |date=April 2007 |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=457–471 |accessdate=2008-05-09 |doi=10.4065/82.4.457 |pmid=17418075 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528040559/http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf%2F8204%2F8204sa.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by psychologists at the American [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] has concluded that "many Internet child pornography offenders may be undetected child molesters", finding a slightly higher percentage of molesters among child pornography offenders than the Mayo Clinic study, though they also "cautioned that offenders who volunteer for treatment may differ in their behavior from those who do not seek treatment." The study was withdrawn by Bureau officials from a peer-reviewed journal which had accepted it for publication, due to concerns that the results might be misinterpreted. Some researchers argued that the findings "do not necessarily apply to the large and diverse group of adults who have at some point downloaded child pornography, and whose behavior is far too variable to be captured by a single survey".&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/19/us/19sex.html |title=Debate on Child Pornography's Link To Molesting |publisher=New York Times |author=Julian Sher and Benedict Carey| date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child protection advocates and psychologists like [[Fred Berlin]], who heads the National Institute for the Study, Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Trauma, expressed disapproval over the failure to publish the report.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

===Criticism===
[[Dennis Howitt]] (1995) disagrees with such research, arguing the weakness of correlational studies. He argues that "one cannot simply take evidence that offenders use and buy pornography as sufficient to implicate pornography causally in their offending.

A Swiss study reviewing the criminal record of 231 men who were charged with viewing child pornography found that those without a prior sexual conviction are unlikely to sexually assault a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Endrass |first=Jérôme |last2=Urbaniok |first2=Frank |date=14 July 2009 |title=The consumption of Internet child pornography and violent and sex offending |url=http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-9-43 |journal=BMC Psychiatry |publisher= |volume=9 |issue=43 |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-9-43 |access-date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swiss_study&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/study-finds-no-link-between-child-porn-and-sex-abuse/story-fn3dxity-1225749645592 |title=Study finds no link between child porn and sex abuse |accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that in the six years before the 2002 police operation, 1% were known to have committed a hands-on sexual offense and 1% committed a hands-on sex offense in the six years afterwards.

Author Frank Urbaniok said it should not automatically be assumed that they were a risk for sexually assaulting a child and said: "Our results support the assumption that these consumers, in fact, form a distinct group of sex offenders. Probably, the motivation for consuming child pornography differs from the motivation to physically assault minors. Furthermore, the recidivism rates of 1% for hands-on and 4% for hands-off sex offences were quite low."&lt;ref name=Swiss_study /&gt; A 2005 paper by Canadian researchers [[Michael Seto]] and Angela Eke found that of 201 men charged with child pornography offenses, 24% had committed prior offenses of sexual contact and 4% went on to commit subsequent sexual offenses after being charged or prosecuted.&lt;ref name=Swiss_study /&gt;

==Views on reducing criminal sexual intent==
Milton Diamond, from the [[University of Hawaii]], presented evidence that "[l]egalizing child pornography is linked to lower rates of child sex abuse". Results from the Czech Republic indicated, as seen everywhere else studied (Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sweden, USA), that rape and other sex crimes "decreased or essentially remained stable" following the legalization and wide availability of pornography. His research also indicated that the incidence of child sex abuse has fallen considerably since 1989, when child pornography became readily accessible – a phenomenon also seen in Denmark and Japan. The findings support the theory that potential sexual offenders use child pornography as a substitute for sex crimes against children. While the authors do not approve of the use of real children in the production or distribution of child pornography, they say that artificially produced materials might serve a purpose.&lt;ref name=Diamond/&gt;

Diamond suggests to provide [[Simulated child pornography|artificially created child pornography]] that does not involve any real children. His article relayed, "If availability of pornography can reduce sex crimes, it is because the use of certain forms of pornography to certain potential offenders is functionally equivalent to the commission of certain types of sex offences: both satisfy the need for psychosexual stimulants leading to sexual enjoyment and orgasm through masturbation. If these potential offenders have the option, they prefer to use pornography because it is more convenient, unharmful and undangerous. (Kutchinsky, 1994, pp. 21)."&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = M. | last2 = Jozifkova | first2 = E. | last3 = Weiss | first3 = P. | doi = 10.1007/s10508-010-9696-y | title = Pornography and Sex Crimes in the Czech Republic | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 1037–1043; discussion 1043–50 | year = 2010 | pmid =  21116701| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rural society in the People's Republic of China''' occupies less than a half of [[China]]'s population (roughly 45%) and has a varied range of [[standard of living]] and means of living. Life in rural China differs from that of urban China. In [[Northern and southern China|southern]] and coastal China, [[rural]] areas are developing and, in some areas, statistically approaching [[urban area|urban]] economies. In [[Northwest China|northwest]] and western regions, rural society remains perceived as of a low standard and primitive. Basic needs such as [[running water]] and accessible [[transportation]] are a problem in these areas.

==History==
===Founding of the People's Republic===
One of the major avowed objects of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) during its rise to prominence between 1921 and 1949 was the improvement of the [[standard of living]] of the average Chinese citizen, the vast majority of whom were rural dwellers. During the pre-1936 period, the CPC played a major role in transforming rural life in areas it influenced or controlled. A major area was [[land reform]], where control was taken from traditional [[landlord|land owners]] and wealthy peasants, and appropriated to the state, that is, [[collectivization|collectivized]]. China in the early post-1949 period saw increases in mechanization of agriculture, the spread of electricity, running water, and modern technology to rural areas. However, by the late 1950s, much remained to be done.

Mao noted that most benefits were accruing not to the rural areas, where the vast majority of Chinese still lived, and who were the ostensible focus of the revolution, but to urban centers. Identity card systems channeled unequal degrees of resources, including food rations, to urbanites and rural dwellers. The "rustication" of the Cultural Revolution failed.

===Great Leap Forward===
During the [[Great Leap Forward]] campaign of 1958 to 1961, China's leaders attempted to accelerate collectivization and dramatically increase the pace of industrial production throughout the country, particularly in rural areas. This mostly involved small-scale production, such as the smelting of "backyard" steel. It was thought that through collectivization and mass labour, China's steel production would surpass that of the [[United Kingdom]] within only 15 years from the start of the "leap." 

An experimental commune was established in [[Henan]] early in 1958, and soon communes spread throughout the country. Tens of millions were mobilised to produce a single commodity that was symbolic of industrialisation—steel. Approximately 25,000 communes were set up, each with around 5,000 households. The hope was to industrialize by making use of the massive supply of cheap labor and avoid having to import heavy [[machinery]]. Small backyard steel furnaces were built in every commune where peasants produced small nuggets of cast iron made from scrap metal. Simultaneously, peasants communities were collectivised.

The Great Leap Forward is now widely seen, both within and outside China, as a major economic disaster. Peasants often abandoned farming to produce steel or work in other industrial production. The three years between 1959 and 1962 were known as the "Three Bitter Years," the [[Three Years of Natural Disasters]] (although this name is now rarely used in China), and the Great Leap Famine, as the Chinese people suffered from extreme shortages of food. The period had a profound impact on the history of rural life in China.

===Post-Mao Zedong era===
Under [[Deng Xiaoping]], urbanization in China has expanded at an unprecedented speed since the declaration of "Reform and Open Policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Zengxiang|date=Oct 2016|title=Urban expansion in China and its effect on cultivated land before and after initiating "Reform and Open Policy"|url=|journal=Science China - Earth Sciences|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; new policies in China's economy shifted the approach from [[collective farming]] to household-based production quotas, in many ways reversing decades of collectivization efforts. In many areas of China, especially southern and coastal China, the standard of living improved dramatically after Deng's reforms. [[Township and Village Enterprises]] brought industrial production to rural areas—predominantly along the southern coasts—helping open these rural communities to greater economic prosperity.
(The idea of industrial production in rural areas had been attempted under Mao but with much more limited success; for instance, industrial plants in highly remote areas found their ultimate production efforts hampered.) Soon, however, an imbalance appeared where northern, interior, and western China remained at a far lower degree of economic development, a situation which persists to the 21st century. However, there are multiple, complex factors contributing to this state of affairs. For instance, distances are much farther, and geography often more challenging, in western and interior regions. Population is more spread out; social structures may also play a role, in that the demographics and social structures of these regions often differ significantly from those of coastal China.

Deng Xiaoping's reforms included the introduction of planned, centralized management of the macro-economy by technically proficient bureaucrats, abandoning Mao's mass campaign style of economic construction. Deng sustained Mao's legacy to the extent that he stressed the primacy of agricultural output and encouraged a significant decentralization of decision making in the rural economy teams and individual peasant households. At the local level, material incentives, rather than political appeals, were to be used to motivate the labor force, including allowing peasants to earn extra income by selling the produce of their private plots at free market.

Rural markets selling peasants' homegrown products and the surplus products of communes were revived under the more free-market economic approach of Deng. Not only did rural markets increase agricultural output, they stimulated industrial development as well. With peasants able to sell surplus agricultural yields on the open market, domestic consumption stimulated industrialization as well and also created political support for more difficult economic reforms.

Development remains uneven, with many highly prosperous areas far outpacing deeply impoverished regions where parents have great difficulty attaining enough income to ensure their children can be sent to school, despite the already-low education fees. Indeed, educational and social imbalances are a salient feature of this uneven development.

One emerging trend since at least the 1990s is the "floating population" or "black (e.g. black market) people", rural migrants (民工 ''min gong'') entering urban areas in search of work. Until recent developments, rural residents lacked the legal permission to resettle in urban areas without approval, yet between tens and hundred of millions did resettle in search of jobs. Many have found work, in the form of construction and other sectors with relatively low wages and benefits, and high workplace hazards. Numerous social issues have developed as a result, namely discrimination of ruralites in cities, psychological isolation of rural migrants, some of which has led to crime. In this sense, then, rural life has "entered" the cities.

Lack of employment opportunities has increasingly made life in many rural regions difficult, hence the apparent enticement to resettle in urban areas. Of course, jobs are still limited, so many do relocate in cities only to find prospects much more meager than they had expected. Statistics suggest a very high proportion of residents of rural areas are [[unemployment|unemployed]] or [[underemployment|underemployed]].

The development of [[Special Economic Zones]] also spurred rural growth in some parts of China.

In 2013, China announced a new plan to reduce poverty and develop impoverished rural regions by raising rural farmers' income growth and reducing obstacles in agricultural development. The plan includes the promotion of new types of agricultural businesses, such as family farms and organized cooperatives, and encouraging industrial and commercial enterprises to invest in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/business/2012-12/22/c_132057739.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510194409/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/business/2012-12/22/c_132057739.htm |archive-date=2013-05-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collectivization and class status==
{{See|People's commune|Production brigade|Production team (China)}}
The first major action to alter village society was the land reform of the late 1940s and early 1950s, in which the party sent work teams to every village to carry out its land reform policy. This in itself was an unprecedented display of administrative and political power. The land reform had several related goals. The work teams were to redistribute some (though not all) land from the wealthier families or land-owning trusts to the poorest segments of the population and so to effect a more equitable distribution of the basic means of production; to overthrow the village elites, who might be expected to oppose the party and its programs; to recruit new village leaders from among those who demonstrated the most commitment to the party's goals; and to teach everyone to think in terms of class status rather than kinship group or patron-client ties.

In pursuit of the last goal, the party work teams convened extensive series of meetings, and they classified all the village families either as [[landlord]]s, rich [[peasant]]s, middle peasants, or poor peasants. These labels, based on family landholdings and overall economic position roughly between 1945 and 1950, became a permanent and hereditary part of every family's identity and, as late as 1980, still affected, for example, such things as chances for admission to the armed forces, colleges, universities, and local administrative posts and even marriage prospects.

The [[collectivization]] of [[agriculture]] was essentially completed with the establishment of the people's communes in 1958. Communes were large, embracing scores of villages. They were intended to be multipurpose organizations, combining economic and local administrative functions. Under the commune system the household remained the basic unit of consumption, and some differences in [[standards of living]] remained, although they were not as marked as they had been before land reform. Under such a system, however, upward mobility required becoming a team or commune cadre or obtaining a scarce technical position such as a being a truck driver.

==Decollectivization==
Under the collectivized system, grain production kept up with population growth (China's population nearly doubled from 1950 to 1980), and the rural population was guaranteed a secure but low level of subsistence. But the collectivized system seemed to offer few possibilities for rapid economic growth. There was some discontent with a system that relied so heavily on orders from above and made so little allowance for local conditions or local initiative. In the late 1970s, administrators in provincial-level units with extensive regions of low yields and consequent low standards of living began experimenting with new forms of [[tenure]] and [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]]. In most cases, these took the form of breaking up the collective production team, contracting with individual households to work assigned portions of collective land, and expanding the variety of crops or livestock that could be produced. The experiments were deemed successful and popular, and they soon spread to all districts. By the winter of 1982-1983, the [[people's communes]] were abolished; they were replaced by administrative townships and a number of specialized teams or businesses that often leased such collective assets as tractors and provided services for money.

The agricultural reforms of the early 1980s led to a confusingly large number of new production arrangements and contracts. Underlying the variability of administrative and contractual forms were several basic principles and trends. In the first place, land, the fundamental means of production, remained collective [[property]]. It was leased, allocated, or contracted to individual [[household]]s, but the households did not own the land and could not transfer it to other households. The household became, in most cases, the basic economic unit and was responsible for its own production and losses. Most economic activity was arranged through contracts, which typically secured promises to provide a certain amount of a commodity or sum of money to the township government in return for the use of land, or workshops, or tractors.

The goal of the [[contracting system]] was to increase [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]] in the use of resources and to tap peasant initiative. The rigid requirement that all villages produce grain was replaced by recognition of the advantages of specialization and exchange, as well as a much greater role for markets. Some "specialized households" devoted themselves entirely to production of [[cash crop]]s or provision of services and reaped large rewards. The overall picture was one of increasing specialization, differentiation, and exchange in the [[rural economy]] and in society in general. Rural incomes increased rapidly, in part because the state substantially increased the prices it paid for staple crops and in part because of economic growth stimulated by the expansion of markets and the rediscovery of comparative advantage.

==Role of the household==
Decollectivization increased the options available to individual households and made household heads increasingly responsible for the economic success of their households. In 1987, for example, it was legally possible to leave the village and move into a nearby town to work in a small factory, open a noodle stand, or set up a machine repair business. Farmers, however, still could not legally move into medium-sized or large cities. The [[Newspapers of China|Chinese press]] reported an increased appreciation in the countryside for [[education]] and an increased desire for agriculturally oriented newspapers and journals, as well as clearly written manuals on such profitable trades as rabbit-raising and beekeeping. As specialization and [[division of labor]] increased, along with increasingly visible differences in income and living standards, it became more difficult to encompass most of the rural population in a few large categories. During the early 1980s, the pace of economic and social change in rural China was rapid, and the people caught up in the change had difficulty making sense of the process.

==Consequences of rural reform==
The state retained both its powers and its role in the rural economy in the 1980s. Decollectivization, like the collectivization of the 1950s, was directed from the top down. Sometimes, apparently, it was imposed on communities that had been content with their collective methods. But in permitting households and communities greater leeway to decide what to produce and in allowing the growth of rural markets and small-scale industries, the state stepped back from the close supervision and mandatory quotas of the 1960s and 1970s.

Decollectivization obviated the [[supervisor]]y functions of low-level cadres, who no longer needed to oversee work on the collective fields. Some [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] became full-time administrators in township offices, and others took advantage of the reforms by establishing specialized production households or by leasing collective property at favorable rates. Former cadres, with their networks of connections and familiarity with administrative procedures, were in a better position than ordinary farmers to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the growth of markets and commercial activity. Even those cadres not wholly devoted to increasing their own families' income found that to serve their fellow villagers as expected it was necessary to act as [[entrepreneur]]s. Village-level cadres in the mid-1980s were functioning less as overseers and more as extension agents and [[marketing]] [[consultant]]s.

By 1987 rural society was more open and diverse than in the 1960s and 1970s, and the rigid collective units of that period, which had reflected the state's overwhelming concern for [[security]], had been replaced by networks and clusters of smaller units. The new, looser structure demonstrated the priority placed on [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and [[economic growth]]. Basic security, in the sense of an adequate supply of food and guarantees of support for the disabled, orphaned, or aged, was taken for granted. Less than half of China's population remembered the insecurity and risks of pre-1950 society, but the costs and inefficiencies of the collective system were fresh in their minds. Increased specialization and [[division of labor]] were trends not likely to be reversed. In the rural areas the significance of the work unit appeared to have diminished, although people still lived in villages, and the actions of low-level administrative cadres still affected ordinary farmers or petty traders in immediate ways.

The state and its officials still dominated the economy, controlled supplies of essential goods, taxed and regulated businesses and markets, and awarded contracts. The stratification system of the [[Maoist]] period had been based on a hierarchy of functionally unspecialized cadres directing the labors of a fairly uniform mass of peasants. It was replaced in the 1980s by a new elite of economically specialized households and entrepreneurs who had managed to come to terms with the administrative cadres who controlled access to many of the resources necessary for economic success. Local cadres still had the power to impose fees, taxes, and all manner of [[exaction]]s. The norms of the new system were not clear, and the economic and social system continued to change in response to the rapid growth of rural commerce and industry and to national economic policies and reforms.

==Regulations and favors==
Increased commercial activity produced a high degree of normative ambiguity, especially in areas like central [[Guangdong]] and [[Jiangsu]] provinces, where rural economic growth was fastest. Neither the proper role of local officials nor the rights and obligations of new entrepreneurs or traders were clear. The line between the normal use of personal contacts and hospitality and extraordinary and criminal [[Cronyism|favoritism]] and corruption was ambiguous. There were hints of the development of a system of patron-client ties, in which administrative cadres granted favors to ordinary farmers in return for support, esteem, and an occasional gift. The increased number of corruption cases reported in the [[Chinese press]] and the widespread assumption that the decollectivization and rural economic reforms had led to growing corruption probably reflected both the increased opportunities for deals and favors of all sorts and the ambiguous nature of many of the transactions and relationships. The party's repeated calls for improved "[[socialist]] spiritual civilization" and the attempts of the central authorities both to create a system of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and to foster respect for it can be interpreted as responses to the problem. On the local level, where cadres and entrepreneurs were engaged in constant negotiation on the rules of their game, the problem was presumably being addressed in a more straightforward fashion.

==Family and household==
In past Chinese society, the family provided every individual's support, livelihood, and long-term security. Today the state guarantees such security to those with no families to provide for them, and families and work units share long-term responsibility for the individual. The role of families has changed, but they remain important, especially in the countryside. Family members are bound, in law and custom, to support their [[aged]] or [[disabled]] members. The state, acting through [[work unit]]s, provides support and benefits only when families cannot. Households routinely pool [[income]], and any individual's [[standard of living]] depends on the number of household wage earners and the number of dependents. In both cities and villages, the highest incomes usually are earned by households with several wage earners, such as unmarried adult sons or daughters.

In late traditional society, family size and structural complexity varied directly with class. Rural landlords and government officials had the largest families, poor peasants the smallest. The poorest segment of the population, landless laborers, could not afford to marry and start families. The need to provide for old age and the general association between the numbers of sons surviving to adulthood and long-term family success motivated individuals to create various non-standard family forms. Couples who produced no sons, or no children at all, adopted or purchased infants outright. Families with daughters but no sons tried to find men willing to marry their daughters and move into their families, abandoning their original families and sometimes even their original [[Chinese surname|surname]]s. Families with daughters but no property to attract a son-in-law were sometimes forced to sell their daughters as [[concubine]]s or [[prostitute]]s. The variation in family size and complexity was the result of variation in class position and of the dual role of the household as both family and economic enterprise.

In contemporary society, rural families no longer own land or pass it down to the next generation. They may, however, own and transmit houses. Rural families pay medical expenses and school fees for their children. Under the [[people's commune]] system in force from 1958 to 1982, the income of a peasant family depended directly on the number of laborers it contributed to the collective fields. This, combined with concern over the level of support for the aged or disabled provided by the collective unit, encouraged peasants to have many sons. Under the agricultural reforms that began in the late 1970s, households took on an increased and more responsible economic role. The labor of family members is still the primary determinant of income. But rural economic growth and [[commercialization]] increasingly have rewarded managerial and technical skills and have made unskilled farm labor less desirable. As long as this economic trend continues in the countryside in the late 1980s, peasant families are likely to opt for fewer but better educated children.

The consequence of the general changes in China's economy and the greater separation of families and economic enterprises has been a greater [[standardization]] of family forms since 1950. In 1987 most families approximated the middle peasant (a peasant owning some land) norm of the past. Such a family consisted of five or six people and was based on marriage between an adult son and an adult woman who moved into her husband's family. The variant family forms - either the very large and complex or those based on minor, nonstandard forms of [[Chinese marriage|marriage]] - were much less common. The state had outlawed concubinage, child [[betrothal]], and the sale of infants or females, all of which were formerly practiced, though not common. Increased [[life expectancy]] meant that a greater proportion of [[infant]]s survived to [[adulthood]] and that more adults lived into their sixties or seventies. More rural families were able to achieve the traditional goal of a three-generation family in the 1980s. There were fewer orphans and young or middle-aged widows or widowers. Far fewer men were forced to retain lifelong single status. [[Divorce]], although possible, was rare, and families were stable, on-going units.

A number of traditional attitudes toward the family have survived without being questioned. It is taken for granted that everyone should marry, and marriage remains part of the definition of normal adult status. Marriage is expected to be permanent. That marriage requires a woman to move into her husband's family and to become a daughter-in-law as well as a wife is still largely accepted. The norm of patrilineal descent and the assumption that it is sons who bear the primary responsibility for their aged parents remain. The party and government have devoted great effort to controlling the number of births and have attempted to limit the number of children per couple. But the authorities have not attempted to control population growth by suggesting that some people should not marry at all.

In the past, [[kinship]] principles were extended beyond the domestic group and were used to form large-scale groups, such as lineages. [[Lineage (anthropology)|Lineage]]s were quite distinct from families; they were essentially corporate economic-political groups. They controlled land and, in some areas of China, dominated whole villages and sets of villages and held title to most of the farmland. Like most other late traditional associations, lineages were dominated by wealthy and educated elites. Ordinary peasants paid as much of their crop to their lineage group as they might have to a landlord. The Communists denounced these organizations as feudal systems by means of which [[landlord]]s exploited others. The lineages were suppressed in the early 1950s and their land confiscated and redistributed in the [[land reform]]. Communal [[worship]] of distant lineage ancestors lost much of its justification with the dissolution of the lineage estate and was easily suppressed over the next several years. Domestic [[ancestor worship]], in which members of a single family worshiped and memorialized their immediate ancestors, continued at least until 1966 and 1967, in the early stages of the [[Cultural Revolution]], when Red Guards destroyed altars and ancestral tablets. In 1987 the party was still condemning ancestor worship as superstitious but had made little effort to end it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/china/51.htm|title=China - Family and Household|website=Countrystudies.us|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
{{Main|Chinese marriage}}
The Marriage Law of 1950 guaranteed everyone the freedom to choose his or her marriage partner. Nevertheless, especially in the countryside, there were few opportunities to meet potential mates. Rural China offered little [[privacy]] for [[courtship]], and in villages there was little public tolerance for [[flirting]] or even extended conversation between unmarried men and women. Introductions and go-betweens continued to play a major role in the arrangement of marriages. In most cases each of the young people, and their parents, had an effective [[veto]] over any proposed match.

In the past, marriage was seen as the concern of families as well as of the two parties to the match. Families united by marriage were expected to be of equivalent status, or the [[Bridegroom|groom]]'s family to be of somewhat higher status. This aspect of marriage patterns has continued while the definitions of status have changed. Because inherited wealth was eliminated as a significant factor, evaluation had  been shifted to estimates of [[earning power]] and future [[prosperity]]. The most desirable husbands have been administrative cadres, party members, and employees of large state enterprises. Conversely, men from poor villages have had difficulty finding wives. From the early 1950s to the late 1970s, when hereditary class labels were very significant, anyone with a "counter-revolutionary" background, that is, anyone previously identified with the landlord or even rich peasant class, was a bad prospect for marriage. Such pariahs often had no choice but to marry the offspring of other families with "bad" class backgrounds. At the other end of the social scale, there appeared to be a high level of intermarriage among the children of high-level cadres.

==Community structure==
Most rural Chinese has lived in one of some 900,000 villages, which have an average population of from 1,000 to 2,000 people. Villages have never been self-contained, self-sufficient units, and the social world of Chinese peasants has extended beyond their home villages. Almost all new wives come into a village from other settlements, and daughters marry out. All villagers have close kinship ties with families in other villages, and marriage go-betweens shuttle from village to village.

Before 1950 clusters of villages centered on small market towns that linked them to the wider economy and society. Most peasants were only a few hours' walk or less from a [[market town]], which provided not only opportunities to buy and sell but also opportunities for [[entertainment]], [[information]], [[Interpersonal relationship|social life]], and a host of specialized services. The villages around a market formed a [[social unit]] that, although less immediately visible than the villages, was equally significant.

From the early 1950s on, China's revolutionary government made great efforts to put the state and its [[ideology]] into direct contact with the villages and to sweep aside the [[intermediaries]] and [[brokers]] who had traditionally interpreted central policies and national values for villagers. The state and the party were generally successful, establishing unprecedented degrees of political and ideological integration of villages into the state and of village-level awareness of state policies and political goals.

The [[unintended consequence]] of the economic and political policies of the 1950s and 1960s was to increase the closed, [[corporate]] quality of China's villages and to narrow the social horizons of villagers. [[Land reform]] and the reorganization of villages as subunits of [[people's communes]] meant that villages became collective landholding units and had clear boundaries between their lands and those of adjacent villages. Central direction of labor on collective fields made the former practices of swapping labor between villages impossible. The household registration and rationing systems confined villagers to their home settlements and made it impossible for them to seek their fortune elsewhere. Cooperation with fellow villagers and good relations with village leaders became even more important than they had been in the past. The suppression of rural markets, which accompanied the drive for self-sufficiency in grain production and other economic activities, had severe social as well as economic consequences. Most peasants had neither reason nor opportunity for regular trips to town, and their opportunities for exchange and cooperation with residents of other villages were diminished. Villages became [[work unit]]s, with all that that implied.

[[Decollectivization]] in the early 1980s resulted in the revival of rural marketing, and a limited relaxation of controls on out-[[emigration|migration]] opened villages and diminished the social boundaries around them. The social world of peasants expanded, and the larger marketing community took on more significance as that of the village proper was diminished. Village membership, once the single most important determinant of an individual's circumstances, became only one of a number of significant factors, which also included occupation, personal connections, and managerial talent.

==Healthcare==
After 1949, the Chinese [[healthcare]] system, in rural areas the first tier was made up of "[[barefoot doctor]]s" working out of village medical centers. They provided preventive and primary-care services, with an average of two doctors per 1,000 people. The barefoot doctors emerged in 1968 when China lacked qualified health workers in rural areas and in 1985, China stopped using the term of barefoot doctor. Most of them were transferred to village doctors as private practitioners, making a living out of drug sales based on user fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Xiaoyun|last2=Zhao|first2=Shichao|last3=Zhang|first3=Minmin|last4=Hu|first4=Dan|last5=Meng|first5=Qingyue|title=The development of rural primary health care in China’s health system reform|journal=Journal of Asian Public Policy|date=16 February 2015|volume=8|issue=1|pages=88–101|doi=10.1080/17516234.2015.1008195}}&lt;/ref&gt;At the next level were the township health centers, which functioned primarily as out-patient clinics for about 10,000 to 30,000 people each. These centers had about ten to thirty beds each, and the most qualified members of the staff were assistant doctors. The two lower-level tiers made up the "rural collective health system" that provided most of the country's medical care. Only the most seriously ill patients were referred to the third and final tier, the county hospitals, which served 200,000 to 600,000 people each and were staffed by senior doctors who held degrees from 5-year medical schools.

In the late 20th and early 21st century, the availability and quality of health care varied widely from city to countryside. According to 1982 census data, in rural areas the crude death rate was 1.6 per 1,000 higher than in urban areas, and life expectancy was about 4 years lower. The number of senior physicians per 1,000 population was about 10 times greater in urban areas than in rural ones; state expenditure on medical care was more than -Y26 per capita in urban areas and less than -Y3 per capita in rural areas. There were also about twice as many hospital beds in urban areas as in rural areas. These are aggregate figures, however, and certain rural areas had much better medical care and nutritional levels than others.

==Biography==

Sattar Alvi was born in [[Bannu]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–55)|NWFP]], [[British India|India]] in 1944, into a family that had the military background. His father was an [[Army officer|officer]] in the [[British Indian Army]] who later served in the [[Pakistan Army]].&lt;ref name="PAF Shaheens"&gt;{{cite web|title=The PAF Shaheens of International Fame - My Voice Unheard|url=http://myvoiceunheard.com/the-paf-shaheens-of-international-fame-pak/|website=myvoiceunheard.com|publisher=PAF Shaheens|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[Bannu]] where he did his matriculation and attneded the [[Government Emerson College|Emerson College]] in [[Multan]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] where he secured his graduation.&lt;ref name="PAF Shaheens"/&gt;

In 1963, he was accepted to join the [[Pakistan Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] in [[Risalpur]] where he received his flight training on the [[Cessna T-37 Tweet|Cessna T-37T]], and graduated in General Duty Pilot (GD) course in 1965.&lt;ref name="PAF Shaheens"/&gt; [[Pilot Officer|P/Off.]] Alvi participated in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|second war]] with [[India]] in 1965, touring his duty as  "Mail Runners" to convey messages from one base to another, served on this assignment until the [[Tashkent Agreement|war was ended]].&lt;ref name="PAF Shaheens"/&gt;

From 1966–71, [[Flight Lieutenant|Flt.Lt]] ([[Captain (air force)|Capt.]]) Alvi was selected in the [[military advisor]] group for the [[Iraqi Air Force]], where he qualified as a [[test pilot]] for the [[MiG-21]] and sat up the training school for the [[Iraqi Air Force|Iraqi IAF]].&lt;ref name="PAF Shaheens"/&gt; He returned to Pakistan to participate in the [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|third war]] with [[India]] and flew the Quick Reaction Close Support Missions especially in Shakargarh, where the battle with the [[Indian Air Force|Indian IAF]] was the most turbulent.&lt;ref name="PAF Shaheens"/&gt; After the war in 1971, [[Flight Lieutenant|Flt.Lt]] Alvi was sent to join the faculty at the [[Pakistan Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] and served as a [[flight instructor]] on the flight manuals on the [[Chengdu J-7|F-7P]], a Chinese variant of [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21F]].&lt;ref name="The Express Tribune, Alvi (2015)" /&gt;

===Yom Kippur War===
[[Pakistani prime minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] sought to maintain close relationships with the [[Arab world]]. When the [[Yom Kippur war]] broke out, Alvi was one of the Pakistan Air Force fighter pilots who volunteered to go to the Middle East to support [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]. By the time they arrived, however, [[Egypt]] and Israel had already concluded a ceasefire and only Syria remained in an active state of war against [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Alvi, who was serving as a [[Flight Lieutenant]] in 1973, joined the [[Syrian Air Force]] along with future-Air Chief Marshal of the Pakistan Air Force, [[Nur Khan]]. The PAF fighter pilots flew in a formation using the call-sign "''Shahbaz''" under [[Air Marshal]] Nur Khan.&lt;ref&gt;http://pavocavalry.wordpress.com/2008/09/17/shahbaz-over-golan-1973-war-golan-idf-click-on-top-to-enlarge/&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Aerial fight over Golan===
On 26 April 1974, PAF fighter pilot [[Flight Lieutenant]] Sattar Alvi on deputation to No. 67A Squadron, [[Syrian Air Force]] (SAF) was flying a SAF [[Mig-21|MiG-21F-13]] (Serial No. 1863) out of Dumayr Air Base, Syria in an eight-ship formation with a fellow PAF pilot and the Flight Leader, [[Squadron Leader]] Arif Manzoor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Alvi came to worldwide international notice when he shot down the [[Israel Air Force|IAF]]'s [[Mirage III]]CJ flown by [[Captain (air force)|Captain]] M. Lutz. On 26 April 1974, while on an aerial patrol, the PAF fighter pilot team including, ''Flight Lieutenant Captain Sattar Alvi'', ''Squadron Leader Major Saleem Metla'' and the formation's leader S''quadron Leader Major Arif Manzoor'' had an encounter over the Golan Heights between a [[Mig-21]] of the [[Syrian Air Force]] and two Israeli Mirages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defencejournal.com/apr99/golan.htm Ibid]&lt;/ref&gt;

While leading a Mig-21 patrol along the border, Squadron Leader Arif Manzoor was apprised of the presence of two [[Israeli Air Force|Israeli]] [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|Phantom aircraft]] and was cautioned that these could be decoys while two other fast tracks approaching from the opposite direction might be the real threat. The latter turned out to be Mirages and a moment later Alvi, in Arif's formation saw the No 2 Mirage breaking towards him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; All this time, heavy radio jamming by Israeli ground stations was making things difficult but the Pakistani pilots were used to such tactics. He managed to shot down the jet piloted by Captain Lutz while the wingman quickly disengaged.

==Honours==
After the engagements, Flight Lieutenant Captain Sattar Alvi and Shahbaz formation leader Squadron Leader Major Arif Manzoor were awarded two of Syria's highest decorations for gallantry, the Wisaam Faris and Wisaam Shuja'at in 1973 by the [[President of Syria|President]] of [[Syria]] [[Hafez al-Assad]] in a public ceremony. The [[Government of Pakistan|government]] of Pakistan also awarded each PAF pilot the Sitara-e-Jur'at. The prime minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] personally met each of them and awarded the gallantry awards in public ceremonies.

==Post war==
After the war, Sattar Alvi was promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] and went on to command PAF's elite Combat Commanders' School and the premier [[PAF Base Rafiqui]]. In 1994, he was promoted to [[Air Commodore]] ([[Brigadier]]) and commanded the [[Pakistan Aeronautical Complex]] (PAC) until 1998. He retired as an [[Air Commodore]] in 1998 and received an [[honourable discharge]] from the air force.

On April 30, 2014, a police officer, Christopher Manney, shot and killed Dontre Hamilton, at Red Arrow Park in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. No charges were brought, but Manney was fired from the force. As a result of the shooting and subsequent protests, Milwaukee police officers were equipped with [[body camera]]s.

==Background==
'''Dontre D. Hamilton''' (d. April 30, 2014), of Milwaukee, was 31 years old at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="TrainingSought"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Meg|last1=Kissinger|first2=Ashley|last2=Luthern|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/autopsy-planned-thursday-on-man-shot-by-police-at-red-arrow-park-b99260307z1-257512561.html|title=More training sought after fatal shooting by Milwaukee police|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=May 2, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton had a history of mental illness.&lt;ref name="TrainingSought"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanchick"&gt;{{cite web|first=Myra|last=Sanchick|url=http://fox6now.com/2014/12/24/documents-describe-dontre-hamiltons-battle-with-mental-illness-his-familys-efforts-to-get-him-help/|title=Documents describe Dontre Hamilton’s battle with mental illness, his family’s efforts to get him help|work=[[WITI (TV)|WITI]]|date=December 24, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he had made a [[suicide attempt]] by stabbing both sides of his neck and had been hospitalized. According to Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn, Hamilton had a prior history of arrests in Milwaukee which were "directly connected to mental health issues."&lt;ref name="TrainingSought"/&gt; Hamilton's family stated that Hamilton had been treated for [[schizophrenia]] but was not violent.&lt;ref name="Sanchick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NoCharges"/&gt; In the days before his death, Hamilton told his family that he was "tired and hungry, and that somebody was going to kill him."&lt;ref name="Sanchick"/&gt;

==Event==
On April 30, 2014, Manney shot Hamilton fourteen times, killing him.&lt;ref name="NoCharges"&gt;{{cite web|first=Ashley|last=Luthern|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/former-officer-wont-be-charged-in-fatal-shooting-of-dontre-hamilton-b99398655z1-286559211.html|title=Ex-Milwaukee officer won't be charged in Dontre Hamilton shooting|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=December 22, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'' summarized the events as follows:

{{quote|Before the encounter, a pair of officers responding to a call that Hamilton was asleep in the park checked on him twice and found he was doing nothing wrong. When Manney arrived, he was not aware that other officers had preceded him

As Manney began to pat down Hamilton, Hamilton fought him, and a confrontation ensued. Manney tried to use his baton to subdue Hamilton, but Hamilton got control of it and swung at Manney, hitting him on the side of the neck, according to Milwaukee police internal affairs.}}

No additional weapons were found on Hamilton's person.&lt;ref name="NoCharges"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Investigation===
The investigation was carried out by the [[Wisconsin Department of Justice|Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation]], a statewide agency, but the lead agents for the investigation were former Milwaukee police officers.&lt;ref name="NoCharges"/&gt; 

The Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office conducted an investigation. In December 2014, District Attorney John Chisholm found the use of force to be in self-defense and declined to prosecute.&lt;ref name="NoCharges"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-milwaukee-officer-not-charged-in-fatal-shooting-of-mentally-ill-man/|title=Dontre Hamilton case: Former officer not charged in fatal Milwaukee shooting|date=December 22, 2014|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibti_Dont"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dontre Hamilton Shooting: Milkwaukee Police Officer Christopher Manney Not Charged As Protests Ignite|first=Howard|last=Koplowitz|work=The International Business Times|date=December 22, 2014|accessdate=May 3, 2015|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/dontre-hamilton-shooting-milkwaukee-police-officer-christopher-manney-not-charged-1765106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc._Milw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Milwaukee shooting: Federal probe for Dontre Hamilton death|work=BBC News|date=December 13, 2014|accessdate=May 3, 2015|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-30584097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firing of Manney===
After the shooting, Manney applied for duty disability, saying the shooting and its aftermath caused him to experience severe [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="NoCharges"/&gt; 

Police Chief Edward Flynn fired Manney after the shooting.&lt;ref name="LuthernPanel"&gt;{{cite web|first=Ashley|last=Luthern|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/retired-cop-defends-manney-pat-down-of-dontre-hamilton-b99467680z1-297289891.html|title=Panel upholds firing of police officer Manney in Hamilton case|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, a three-member panel of the Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission unanimously upheld the firing, sustaining  and confirming the two conclusions of an [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal]] investigation, which determined that:

#Manney had conducted a [[frisking]] process without a [[reasonable suspicion]].
#Manney did follow departmental "Defense and Arrest Tactics."&lt;ref name="LuthernPanel"/&gt;

The firing does not affect Manney's pending disability application.&lt;ref name="LuthernPanel"/&gt;

===Lawsuit===
In 2014, Jovan Blacknell was retained by the family of Hamilton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fox6now.com/2014/05/08/california-attorney-takes-interest-in-dontre-hamiltons-death-flies-to-milwaukee/|title=California attorney takes interest in Dontre Hamilton’s death, flies to Milwaukee|date=2014-05-09|work=FOX6Now.com|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/dontre-hamilton-family-retains-attorneys-to-gain-information-b99265869z1-258518521.html|title=Dontre Hamilton family retains attorneys to gain information|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Hamilton family received a 2.3 million dollar settlement from the City of Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cherelus |first1=Gina |title=Family Of Dontre Hamilton, Teen Killed By Police, Receives $2.5 Million Settlement |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/family-of-dontre-hamilton-teen-killed-by-police-receives-25-million-settlement_us_59305be6e4b07572bdbfd7e0 |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests===
Dontre's brother, Nate Hamilton, has also since co-founded the Coalition for Justice, an organization that has led rallies, marches, and street clean-ups. The [[Black Lives Matter]] movement has also protested Hamilton's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seigle|first1=Max|title=Many participate in 'Black Lives Matter' rally downtown|url=http://www.wisn.com/news/many-participate-in-black-lives-matter-rally-downtown/30233084|publisher=[[WISN-TV]]|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy changes===
In the aftermath of Hamilton's death, "Hamilton's family members worked with Milwaukee Mayor [[Tom Barrett (Wisconsin politician)|Tom Barrett]], the Police Department and other city leaders to have all officers receive [[Crisis Intervention Team]] training, considered the gold standard for working with people in psychiatric crisis, by 2017."&lt;ref name="NoCharges"/&gt;

Additionally, eight Milwaukee aldermen and a majority of the Milwaukee Common Council, called in December 2014 for equipping all city police officers with [[body camera]]s on an expedited basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Don|last=Behm|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/aldermen-call-for-reforms-after-no-charges-filed-in-hamilton-case-b99414285z1-286677821.html|title=Aldermen call for body cameras for all city officers|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=December 23, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, the Fire and Police Commission approved, by a 4–1 vote, a new policy requiring "most Milwaukee police officers to wear body cameras at all times while on duty, though they will not be required to have the devices always activated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jesse|last=Garza|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/commission-approves-milwaukee-police-body-camera-policy-b99597619z1-333122791.html|title=Commission approves Milwaukee police body camera policy|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=October 15, 2015|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A four-phase implementation process was developed, and officers began to wear the cameras in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisn.com/news/Milwaukee-police-to-update-commission-on-body-cameras/38059366|title=Milwaukee police to update commission on body cameras: Officers have been using cameras since October|work=[[WISN-TV]]|date=February 18, 2016|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following [[2016 Milwaukee riots|a similar police shooting of a Milwaukee black man in 2016]], the [[Milwaukee Police Department]] was criticized for not submitting a review of its new patterns and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/milwaukee-officials-call-calm-unrest-073812266.html|title=Volunteers clean up after violence on Milwaukee's north side|publisher=Yahoo!

===Film===
In 2017, the film ''The Blood is at the Doorstep'' was released, which features Hamilton's family in the immediate months following his Manney killing him in self-defense. Directed by Erik Ljung, it was nominated for a [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6491296/awards SXSW Grand Jury Award.]

It was spoken in and around the village of [[Sireniki]] (Сиреники) in [[Chukotka Peninsula]], [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]], [[Russia]]. The [[language shift]] has been a long process, ending in total [[language death]].

== Classification ==

=== Genealogical ===

==== External ====
Some argue that the Sirenik language is a remnant of a third group of [[Eskimo language]]s, in addition to [[Yupik languages|Yupik]] and [[Inuit languages|Inuit]] groups,&lt;ref name=Vakh-Sir/&gt;&lt;ref name=ssipr/&gt;&lt;ref name=VE3&gt;[http://www.siberian-studies.org/publications/PDF/bevakhtin.pdf Vakhtin 1998]: 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=icc-ch-lan&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ru:Языки эскимосов |work=ICC Chukotka |publisher=[[Inuit Circumpolar Council]] |language=Russian |url=http://www.icc.hotbox.ru/yaziki.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=men3&gt;[http://www.philology.ru/linguistics4/menovshikov-97a.htm Меновщиков 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; see online a visual representation by tree and an argumentation based on [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref name=tree&gt;Representing genealogical relations of (among others) Eskimo–Aleut languages by tree: [http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/groups/ Alaska Native Languages] (found on the site of [http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/ Alaska Native Language Center])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=complink&gt;[http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/resources/yupik-inuit/ Lawrence Kaplan: Comparative Yupik and Inuit] (found on the site of [http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/ Alaska Native Language Center])&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the exact [[Language family|genealogical classification]] of Sireniki language is not settled yet,&lt;ref name=Vakh-Sir/&gt; and some others regard it belonging to the Yupik branch.&lt;ref name=siryup&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=91176 Ethnologue Report for Eskimo–Aleut]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kapyup&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000861/086162e.pdf Kaplan 1990]: 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Many words are formed from entirely different [[Root (linguistics)|root]]s than in Siberian Yupik.&lt;ref name=diff-root&gt;{{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the grammar has several peculiarities compared to other Eskimo languages, and even compared to [[Aleut language|Aleut]]. For example, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] is not known in Sireniki Eskimo, while most [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut language]] have dual,&lt;ref name=only2&gt;{{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; including even its neighboring [[Siberian Yupik language|Siberian Yupik]] relatives.&lt;ref name=verb2&gt;{{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peculiarities amounted to mutual unintelligibility with even its nearest language relatives. This forced Sirenik Eskimos to use [[Chukchi language]] as a [[lingua franca]] when speaking with [[Siberian Yupik|neighboring Eskimo peoples]].&lt;ref name=linfranc&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000861/086162e.pdf Menovshchikov 1990]: 70&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, any external contacts required using a different language for Sireniki Eskimos: they either resorted to use of lingua franca, or used [[Siberian Yupik language]]s (being definitely a mutually unintelligible, different language for them, not just a dialect of their own).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference from all their language relatives may be the result of a supposed long isolation from other Eskimo groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Меновщиков|1962|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sireniki Eskimos may have been in contact only with speakers of unrelated languages for many centuries in the past, influenced especially by non-relative Chukchi.&lt;ref name=linfranc/&gt;

==== Internal ====

Although the number of its speakers was very few even at the end of the nineteenth century, the language had at least two [[dialect]]s in the past.&lt;ref name=VES/&gt;

=== Typological ===

As for its [[morphological typology]], it has [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] and [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporative]] features (just like the other Eskimo languages).

== Phonology ==
{{expand section|date=November 2013}}
Some notes (very far from being a complete description):
* The [[alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|/l/}} has its voiceless version {{IPA|/l̥/}}, and it can be also palatalized {{IPA|/lʲ̥/}}
* [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}}

== Morphology ==

Like all other Eskimo languages, the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is rather complex. A description grouped by [[Lexical category|lexical categories]] follows.

=== Nominal and verbal ===

Although morphology will be treated grouped into a nominal and a verbal part, many Eskimo languages show features which “[[Cross-cutting concern|crosscut]]” any such groupings in several aspects:
* the [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative]] structure at verbs is similar to the [[Possession (linguistics)|possessive]] structure at nouns (see section [[#Ergative–absolutive]]);
* a physical similarity exists between nominal and verbal personal suffix paradigms, i.e., in most cases, the respective person-number is expressed with the same sequence of phonemes at:
** [[possessive suffix]]es (at nouns)
** verbal suffixes;
* nomenverbum-like roots, becoming nominal or verbal only via the suffix they get;
* Eskimo texts abound in various kinds of participles (see section [[#Participles]]);

==== Common grammatical categories ====

Some [[Grammatical category|grammatical categories]] (e.g. [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]]) are applicable to both verbal and nominal [[Lexical category|lexical categories]].

Although person and number are expressed in a single suffix, sometimes it can be traced back to consist of a distinct person and a distinct number suffix.&lt;ref name=person-number&gt;Person and number in a single suffix, or in two distinct ones: p. 61 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Person =====

[[Inflection|Paradigm]]s can make a distinction in 3rd person for “self”, thus the mere personal suffix (of the verb or noun) can distinguish e.g.
;a nominal example
:“He/she takes his/her own dog” versus “He/she takes the dog of another person”.
;a verbal example
:“He/she sees himself/herself” versus “He/she sees him/her (another person)”

Thus, it can be translated into English (and some other languages) using [[reflexive pronoun]]. This notion concerns also other concepts in building larger parts of the sentence and the text, see section [[#Usage of third person suffixes]].

===== Number =====

Although other Eskimo languages know more than the familiar two [[grammatical number]]s (by having also [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]]), Sireniki uses only singular and [[plural]], thus it lacks dual. As mentioned, Sireniki is peculiar in this aspect not only among Eskimo languages, but even in the entire [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut language family]],&lt;ref name=only2/&gt; even its neighboring [[Siberian Yupik language|Siberian Yupik]] relatives have dual.&lt;ref name=verb2/&gt;

==== Building verbs from nouns ====

Suffix -{{IPA|/ɕuɣɨn/}}- meaning “to be similar to sth”:

{| border=1
! Root
! Becomes verbal by suffix&lt;ref name=similar&gt;Suffix -{{IPA|/ɕuɣɨn/}}- meaning “to be similar to sth”: p. 66 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| {{IPA|/mɨtɨχlʲ̥ux-'''ɕuɣɨn'''-tɨ-χ/}}
|-
| raven
| to be '''similar''' to a raven
| he/she is '''similar''' to a raven
|}

===== Predicative form of a noun =====

Predicative form of a noun can be built using suffix -{{IPA|/t͡ʃ ɨ/}}-:&lt;ref name=predform&gt;Predicative form of a noun (suffix -{{IPA|/t͡ʃ ɨ/}}-): p. 66–67 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| {{IPA|/juɣɨ t͡ʃ ɨχ/}}
|-
| man
| to be a man
| you are a man
| he/she is a man
|}

===== Verbs built from [[toponym]]s =====

* {{IPA|/imtuk/}} (a [[Toponymy|toponym]]: Imtuk)
* {{IPA|/imtux-tɨqɨχ-tɨ-ŋ/}} (I travel to Imtuk.)&lt;ref name=topnymverb&gt;Verbs built from [[Toponymy|toponym]]s: p. 67 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nominal lexical categories ===

==== Grammatical categories ====

Not only the [[Declension|grammatical case]]s of nouns are marked by suffixes, but also the person of possessor (use of possessive pronouns in English) can be expressed by [[agglutination]].

{| border=1 align=center
|+ Excerpt from cases and personal possessive form of {{IPA|/taŋaχ/}} (child)&lt;ref name=persposs&gt;Personal possessive form: p. 44–45 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| {{IPA|/taŋamni/}} (at my child)
| {{IPA|/taŋaχpɨni/}} (at your child)
|-
! [[Equative case|Equative]] (comparative)
| {{IPA|/taŋamtɨn/}} (like my child)
| {{IPA|/taŋaχpɨtɨn/}} (like your child)
|}
It is just an excerpt for illustration: not all cases are shown, Sirenik language has more grammatical cases. The table illustrates also why Sirenik language is treated as [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] (rather than [[Fusional language|fusional]]).

There is no [[grammatical gender]] (or gender-like [[noun class]] system).

===== Case =====
Sireniki is an [[absolutive–ergative language]].

Cases (listed using Menovščikov's numbering):
# [[Absolutive case|Absolutive]]
# Relative case, playing the role of both [[genitive case]] and [[ergative case]].
# [[Ablative case|Ablative]] / [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], used also in [[Accusative case|accusative]] structures.
# [[Dative case|Dative]] / [[Lative case|lative]]
# [[Locative case|Locative]]
# [[Vialis case]], see also [[prosecutive case]], and [[List of grammatical cases#Motion via|"motion via"]]
# [[Equative case|Equative]] (comparative)

To see why a single case can play such distinct roles at all, read [[morphosyntactic alignment]], and also [[List of grammatical cases#Morphosyntactic alignment|a short table about it]].

Some finer [[grammatical function]]s are expressed using [[postposition]]s. Most of them are built as a combinations of cases
* lative or locative or ablative
* combined with relative (used as genitive)
in a similar way as we use expressions like "on top of" in English.

=== Verbal lexical categories ===
Also at verbs, the morphology is very rich. Suffixes can express [[grammatical mood]]s of the verb (e.g. [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[Interrogative mood|interrogative]], [[Optative mood|optative]]), and also negation, [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], the [[Grammatical person|person]] of subject and object. Some examples (far from being comprehensive):

{| border=1
! rowspan=3 | Phonology
! rowspan=3 | Meaning
! colspan=4 | Grammatical notes
|-
! colspan=2 | Person, number of
! rowspan=2 | [[Grammatical mood|Mood]]
! rowspan=2 | Others

|-
| {{IPA|/aʁaʁɨ-tɨqɨχ-tɨ-mkɨn/}}
| I lead you
| Singular 1st person
| Singular 2nd person
| Indicative
|
|-
| {{IPA|/aʁaʁɨ-ɕuk-ɨ-mɕi/}}
| Let me lead you
| Singular 1st person
| Singular 2nd person
| Imperative&lt;ref name=imp&gt;Imperative: p. 86 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|-
| {{IPA|/nɨŋɨ-sɨɣɨŋ-sɨn/}}
| Don't you see me?
| Singular 2nd person
| Singular 1st person
| [[Interrogative]]
| Negative polarity&lt;ref name=neg&gt;Negation form of a verb: p. 89 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rich set of [[morpheme]]s makes it possible to build huge verbs whose meaning could be expressed (in most of widely known languages) as whole sentences (consisting of more words) . Sireniki – like the other Eskimo languages – has [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] and [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporative]] features, in many forms, among others [[polypersonal agreement]].

==== Grammatical categories ====

The [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] and [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporative]] features mentioned above manifest themselves in most of the ways Sirenik language can express [[Grammatical category|grammatical categories]].

===== Transitivity =====

For background, see [[Transitivity (grammatical category)|transitivity]]. (Remember also section [[#Ergative–absolutive]].)

See also.&lt;ref name=TerShir-ISP&gt;Nicole Tersis and Shirley Carter-Thomas: [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?doi=10.1086/501248&amp;erFrom=635141024526605061Guest Integrating Syntax and Pragmatics: Word Order and Transitivity Variations in Tunumiisut]. It treats an Inuit language: not Sireniki, but a relative. Availability: on paper and restricted online.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Polarity =====

Even the [[grammatical polarity]] can be expressed by adding a suffix to the verb.

An example for negative polarity: the negation form of the verb {{IPA|/aʁaʁ-/}} (to go):
* {{IPA|/juɣ aʁaχ-tɨqɨχ-tɨ-χ/}} (the man walks)
* {{IPA|/juɣ aʁaʁ-ɨ-tɨ-χ/}} (the man does not walk)&lt;ref name=neg/&gt;

===== Aspect =====

[[Grammatical aspect]]:
* {{IPA|/aftalʁa-'''qɨstaχ'''-/}} (to work '''slowly''') and {{IPA|/aftalʁa-'''qɨstaχ'''-tɨqɨχ-tɨ-χ/}} (he works '''slowly'''),&lt;ref name=aspslow&gt;Suffix -{{IPA|/qɨstaχ-/}} for slow action [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]: p. 72 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{IPA|/aftalʁa-/}} (to work)

===== Modality =====

Also [[linguistic modality]] can be expressed by suffixes. [[Modal verb]]s like "want to", "wish to" etc. do not even exist:&lt;ref name=mod&gt;Modality: p. 68 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| border=1 align=center
|+Suffix -jux- (to want to):
| {{IPA|/aftalʁaχ-/}} (to work)
| {{IPA|/aftalʁaʁ-'''jux'''-/}} (to '''want''' to work)&lt;ref name=mod/&gt;
|-
| {{IPA|/aftalʁaχ-tɨqɨχ-tɨ-ŋ/}} (I work)&lt;ref name=present&gt;Present tense: p. 61 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| {{IPA|/aftalʁaʁ-'''jux'''-tɨqɨχ-tɨ-ŋ/}} (I '''want''' to work)&lt;ref name=mod/&gt;
|}
The table illustrates also why Sirenik is treated as [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] (rather than [[Fusional language|fusional]]).

===== Voice =====

Four [[grammatical voice]]s are mentioned in:&lt;ref name=voice&gt;[[Grammatical voice]]s: p. 78–80 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;active
;passive
:confer {{IPA|-/ɕi/-}} that variant of [[Siberian Yupik]] which is spoken by Ungazigmit&lt;ref&gt;Рубцова 1954, pp. 121–123&lt;/ref&gt;
;middle (medial)
;causative
:{{IPA|/malikam aʁaχ-'''ɕaχ'''-tɨqɨχ-tɨ-ʁa kɨtuɣi qurŋi-nu/}} (Malika '''make'''s Kitugi go to the reindeer.)&lt;ref name=voice/&gt;
all of them are expressed by agglutination, thus, no separate words are required.

=== Participles ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Participle]] --&gt;

A distinction between two kinds of [[participle]]s ([[adverbial participle]] and [[adjectival participle]]) makes sense in Sireniki (just like in [[Hungarian grammar|Hungarian]], see [[:hu:Határozói igenév|határozói igenév]] and [[:hu:Melléknévi igenév|melléknévi igenév]] for detailed description of these concepts; or in [[Russian grammar|Russian]], see [[:ru:Деепричастие|деепричастие]] and [[:ru:Причастие (часть речи)|причастие]]).

Sireniki has many kinds of participles in both categories. In the following, they will be listed, grouped by the relation between the “dependent action” and “main action” (or by other meanings beyond this, e.g. [[Linguistic modality|modality]]) – following the terminology of &lt;ref name=Men-JazSirEsk/&gt;. A sentence with a participle can be imagined as simulating a subordinating [[compound sentence (linguistics)|compound sentence]] where the action described in the [[dependent clause]] relates somehow to the action described in the [[Independent clause|main clause]]. In English, an [[adverbial clause]] may express [[Adverbial clause#Kinds of adverbial clauses|reason, purpose, condition, succession etc.]], and a [[relative clause]] can express many meanings, too.

In an analogous way, in Sireniki Eskimo language, the "dependent action" (expressed by the adverbial participle in the sentence element called [[adverbial]], or expressed by the adjectival participle in the sentence element called attribute) relates somehow to the “main action” (expressed by the verb in the sentence element called [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]), and the participles will be listed below grouped by this relation (or by other meanings beyond this, e.g. [[Linguistic modality|modality]]).

==== Adverbial participles ====

They can be translated into English e.g. by using an appropriate [[adverbial clause]]. There are many of them, with various meanings.

An interesting feature: they can have person and number. The person of the dependent action need not coincide with that of the main action. An example (meant in the British English usage of “shall / should” in the 1st person: here, conveying only conditional, but no necessity or morality):

{| border=1
|+ “I” versus “we”
| {{IPA|/mɨŋa iŋɨjaxtɨk-t͡ʃɨ-ʁɨjɨqɨɣɨ-ma, ajvɨʁaʁjuʁuχtɨki/}}
|-
| If ''I'' were a marksman, ''we'' should kill walrus
|}

Another example (with a different adverbial participle):
{| border=1
|+ “he/she” versus “they”
| {{IPA|/ɨ̆ l̥tɨʁinɨq ȷ̊an, upʃuχtɨqɨχtɨʁij/}}
|-
| when ''he/she'' sings, ''they'' keep frightening him/her
|}

They will be discussed in more details below.

===== Reason, purpose or circumstance of action =====

An adverbial participle “explaining reason, purpose or circumstance of action” is expressed by suffix -{{IPA|/lɨ/}}- / -{{IPA|/ l̥ɨ/}}- (followed by appropriate person-number suffix). Examples:&lt;ref name=cagoco&gt;Adverbial participle -{{IPA|/lɨ/}}- / - {{IPA|/l̥ɨ/}}- “explaining reason, purpose or circumstance of action”: pp. 90–91 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| border=1
! rowspan=2 | Persons
! colspan=2 | Sentence
|-
! Adverbial participle
! Verb
|-
| rowspan=2 | 1st—1st
| {{IPA|/jɨfkɨ-lɨ-ma}}
| {{IPA|itχɨ-mɨ-t͡ʃɨ-ŋ/}}
|-
| (I) having stood up

| {{IPA|/jɨfkɨ-lɨ-mi}}
| {{IPA|itχɨ-mɨ-tɨ-χ/}}
|-
| (he/she) having stood up
| he/she went in
|}

Another example,&lt;ref name=wenttoexamine&gt;Adverbial participle -{{IPA|/lɨ/}}- / -{{IPA|/ l̥ɨ/}}- “explaining reason, purpose or circumstance of action” exemplified in another usage: p. 99 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a somewhat different usage:
{| border=1
! Adverbial participle
! Verb
|-
| {{IPA|/nɨŋitu l̥ɨku}}
| {{IPA|pɨjɨkɨŋa/}}
|-
| To examine him/her&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (another being)
| he/she&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; went
|}

===== Dependent action ends just before main action begins =====

Using the adverbial participle -{{IPA|/ja/}}- / -{{IPA|/ɕa/}}-, the dependent action (expressed by the adverbial participle in the [[sentence element]] called [[adverbial]]) finishes just before the main action (expressed by the verb in the sentence element called [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]) begins.&lt;ref name=endjustbeg&gt;Adverbial participle -{{IPA|/ja/}}- / -{{IPA|/ɕa/}}- (dependent action ends just before main action begins): pp. 91–92 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Dependent action begins before main action, but they continue together till end =====

It can be expressed by suffix -{{IPA|/inɨq ȷ̊a/}}-.&lt;ref name=endjustbeg&gt;Adverbial participle -{{IPA|/ja/}}- / -{{IPA|/ɕa/}}- (dependent action ends just before main action begins): p. 92 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples:

{| border=1

|-
| when he/she sings, they keep frightening him/her
|}

===== Conditional =====

Dependent action is conditional: it does not takes place, although it would (either really, or provided that some—maybe irreal—conditions would hold). Confer also [[conditional sentence]].

Sireniki Eskimo has several adverbial participles to express that.&lt;ref name=condadvpart&gt;Adverbial participles conveying conditional dependent action: pp. 92–93 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can distinguish them according to the concerned condition (conveyed by the dependent action): it may be
* either real (possible to take place in the future)
* or irreal (it would take place only if some other irreal condition would hold)

====== Real ======

It is expressed with suffix -{{IPA|/qɨɣɨ/}}- / -{{IPA|/kɨɣɨ/}}-, let us see e.g. a paradigm beginning with {{IPA|/aʁa-qɨɣɨ-ma/}} (if I get off / depart); {{IPA|/aʁa-qɨɣɨ-pi/}} (if you get off / depart):

{| border=1
! rowspan=2 colspan=2 |
! colspan=2 | Number
|-
! Singular
! Plural
|-
! rowspan=3 | Person
! 1st
| {{IPA|/aʁa-qɨɣɨ-ma/}}
| {{IPA|/aʁa-qɨɣɨ-mta/}}
|-
! 2nd
| {{IPA|/aʁa-qɨɣɨ-pi/}}
| {{IPA|/aʁa-qɨɣɨ-pɨɕi/}}
|-
! 3rd
| {{IPA|/aʁa-qɨɣɨ-mi/}}
| {{IPA|/aʁa-qɨɣɨ-mɨŋ/}}
|}

====== Irreal ======
Confer [[counterfactual conditional]]. Sireniki can compress it into an adverbial participle: it is expressed with suffix -{{IPA|/ɣɨjɨqɨɣɨ/}}- / -{{IPA|/majɨqɨɣɨ/}}-.

The dependent action is expressed with an adverbial participle. The main action is conveyed by the verb. If also the main action is conditional (a typical usage), than it can be expressed with a verb of conditional mood. The persons need not coincide.

An example (meant in the British English usage of “shall / should” in the 1st person: here, conveying only conditional, but no necessity or morality):

{| border=1
| {{IPA|/mɨŋa iŋɨjaxtɨk-t͡ʃɨ-ʁɨjɨqɨɣɨ-ma, ajvɨʁaʁjuʁuχtɨki/}}
|-
| If I were a marksman, we should kill walrus.
|}

| the suffix of the adverbial participle
| irreal condition
|-
| -{{IPA|/ma/}}

| subject 1st person
|}

==== Adjectival participles ====

There are more kinds of them.
* {{IPA|/imtuɡnu aʁaqt͡ʃɨχ qɨmɨ l̥ɨʁaχ utɨχt͡ʃɨmɨt͡ʃɨχ/}} (The sledge [that went to Imtuk] returned.)
* {{IPA|/juɣ qavɨ l̥ɨʁɨχ nɨŋɨsɨmɨrɨqa/}} (I saw [perceived] a sleeping man.)
They can be used not only in attributive role (as in the above examples), but also in predicative role:&lt;ref name=rolesadjpart&gt;Attribute versus predicative usage of adjectival participles: p. 95 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/juɣ qavɨ l̥ɨʁɨχ/}} (The man is sleeping.)

===== Modality =====

Adjectival participle -{{IPA|/kajux/}} / -{{IPA|/qajux/}} conveys a meaning related rather to [[Linguistic modality|modality]] (than to the relation of dependent action and main action). It conveys meaning “able to”.&lt;ref name=adjpart-able&gt;Adjectival participle -{{IPA|/kajux/}} / -{{IPA|/qajux/}} (able to): p. 97 of {{harvnb|Меновщиков|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/taŋaʁaχ pijɨ'''kajux''' pijɨxtɨqɨχtɨχ &amp;nbsp;l̥mɨnɨŋ/}} (A child who is able to walk moves around spontaneously)

== Syntax ==

=== Ergative–absolutive ===

Sireniki is (just like many Eskimo languages) an [[ergative–absolutive language]]. For English-language materials treating this feature of Sireniki, see Vakhtin's book,&lt;ref name=Vakh-Sir/&gt; or see online a paper treating a relative Eskimo language.&lt;ref name=Sch-WGAP&gt;Bodil Kappel Schmidt: [http://www.ub.uit.no/baser/nordlyd/include/getdoc.php?id=106&amp;article=12&amp;mode=pdf West Greenlandic antipassive]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Usage of third person suffixes ===

Although the below examples are taken from [[Inuit]] Eskimo languages ([[Kalaallisut language|Kalaallisut]]), but e.g. Sireniki's distinguishing between two kinds of 3rd person suffixes can be concerned, too (remember section [[#Person]] above: there is a distinct reflexive (“own”-like) and an “another person”-like 3rd person suffix).

==== Topic–comment ====

For a detailed theoretical treatment concerning the notions of [[Topic (linguistics)|topic]] (and [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]], and [[Binding (linguistics)|binding]]), with Eskimo-related examples, see online [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~mbittner/ Maria Bittner]'s works, especially.&lt;ref name=Bit-WO&gt;[http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~mbittner/pdf%20files%20for%20web/bittner%2003_cls.pdf Word Order and Incremental Update]. See also the author's Kalaallisut materials.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Obviation ====

For a treatment of ''obviation'' in (among others) Eskimo languages, see online&lt;ref name=obv&gt;Maria Bittner and Ken Hale: [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~mbittner/pdf%20files%20for%20web/bittner%20&amp;%20hale%2093.pdf Comparative notes on ergative case systems]. Rutgers and MIT. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and in more details (also online)&lt;ref name=BittHal-Erg&gt;Maria Bittner and Ken HaleErgativity: [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~mbittner/pdf%20files%20for%20web/bittner%20&amp;%20hale%2096b.pdf Towards a theory of a heterogenous class]&lt;/ref&gt; from the same authors.

'''''The Magnitsky Act – Behind the Scenes''''' is a 2016 [[docudrama]]&lt;ref name=NYTimes2016-06-09/&gt; feature film directed by [[Andrei Nekrasov]], concerning the 2009 death in a Moscow prison cell, after 11 months in police custody, of 37-year-old Russian tax accountant [[Sergei Magnitsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pan|first=Philip P.|date=November 18, 2009|title=Russian lawyer who alleged police corruption dies in prison|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/17/AR2009111703188.html|work=The Washington Post|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Magnitsky was hired by American-born British financier [[Bill Browder]] to investigate the government's seizure of three of Browder's Russian subsidiaries.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2016-06-09&gt;{{cite news|last=Landler|first=Mark|date=June 9, 2016|title=Film About Russian Lawyer's Death Creates an Uproar|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/world/europe/sergei-magnitsky-russia-vladimir-putin.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discovering evidence of embezzlement, Magnitsky implicated two senior police officers in a tax rebate scam that used [[shell corporations]]&lt;ref name=WaPo2016-06-19&gt;{{cite news|last=Editorial Board|date=June 19, 2016|title=Russian agitprop lands in Washington|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/russian-agitprop-lands-in-washington/2016/06/19/784805ec-33dc-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html|work=The Washington Post|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; plundered from Browder's holdings to defraud the Russian treasury of $230 million.&lt;ref name=Guardian2016-06-10&gt;{{cite news|last=Eckel|first=Mike|date=June 10, 2016|title=Controversial film on Sergei Magnitsky's death set for US screening|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/10/controversial-film-russia-lawyers-sergei-magnitsky-death-screening|work=The Guardian|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subordinates of those officials then arrested Magnitsky and charged him with the very crime he had exposed.&lt;ref name=SundayTimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Dying in agony: his reward for solving a $230 million fraud|last=Driscoll|first=Margarette|url=http://www.justiceforsergei.com/download.php?id=16.|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=November 14, 2010|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The film is a co-production of German public television broadcaster [[ZDF]],&lt;ref name=RussiaInsider2016-04-28&gt;{{cite web|url=https://russia-insider.com/en/politics/empty-seat-william-browder-once-again-takes-charge-european-parliament/ri14127|title=Bill Browder Forces Cancellation of Film Critical of Him Minutes Before Screening in Brussels|last=Doctorow|first=Gilbert|date=April 28, 2016|work=[[Russia Insider]]|access-date=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wingman Media ApS, and Illume OY,&lt;ref name=NFI/&gt; with support from the [[Norwegian Film Institute]], Nordisk Film &amp; TV Fond,&lt;!-- EDITORS: Do not Wikilink to Nordisk Film, which is a commercial film production and distribution company.

==Release==
The film's premiere was set for the [[European Parliament]] in Brussels on April 27, 2016. The event was organized by Finnish [[Green League|Green Party]] politician and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Heidi Hautala]]. In 2010, Hautala introduced her then-boyfriend Andrei Nekrasov to Bill Browder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Orlova|first=Karina|date=June 16, 2016|title=Russia's Plot to Smear Magnitsky|url=https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/06/16/russias-plot-to-smear-magnitsky/|work=[[The American Interest]]|access-date=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now Nekrasov had made a film featuring extensive interview footage of Browder and challenging his single-handed control of the Magnitsky narrative.

At the eleventh hour, the premiere was canceled. ''The New York Times'' said threats of libel suits from Bill Browder accusing Nekrasov of defaming both him and Magnitsky had accompanied the cancellation.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2016-06-09/&gt; Nekrasov blamed two last-minute interventions. The first was from MEP Marieluise Beck, unhappy because Nekrasov refused to remove her interview segment from his film. The second objection, which Nekrasov considered decisive, came from the film's principal sponsor, German public television broadcaster ZDF.&lt;ref name=RussiaInsider2016-04-28/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmeri|first=Tara|date=April 27, 2016|title=MEPs dragged into Russia film row|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/meps-dragged-into-russia-film-row-lawyer-whistleblower-sergei-magnitsky-act-andrei-nekrasov-documentary/|work=[[Politico]]|access-date=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with its French public television subsidiary [[Arte]], ZDF also shelved the film a few days before its scheduled telecast.&lt;ref name=Nation2016-06-20/&gt; 

''The Magnitsky Act – Behind the Scenes'' premiered in [[Oslo, Norway]] in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://andreinekrasov.livejournal.com/5987.html|title=Andrei Nekrasov's statement for the Norwegian Helsinki Committee Magnitsky Hearing - Andrei Nekrasov's blog|last=Nekrasov|first=Andrei|date=November 27, 2017|website=livejournal.com|publisher=[[LiveJournal]]|access-date=August 4, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804231753/https://andreinekrasov.livejournal.com/5987.html|archivedate=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In June 2016, ''The New York Times'' reported that the film was "generating a furor."&lt;ref name=NYTimes2016-06-09/&gt; On June 13, it was shown by invitation only&lt;ref name=Guardian2016-06-10/&gt; at the [[Newseum]], a private museum in Washington, D.C. dedicated to the news industry.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2016-06-09/&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it part of "a campaign to discredit Browder and the Magnitsky Act."&lt;ref name=WaPo2016-06-19/&gt; Lawyers for Browder and Sergei Magnitsky's mother demanded that the screening be canceled.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2016-06-09/&gt; ''The New York Times'' said showing it at the Newseum, which "sits on Pennsylvania Avenue in the shadow of the Capitol," was "especially controversial because it could attract lawmakers or their aides."&lt;ref name=NYTimes2016-06-09/&gt; Besides congressional staffers, invitees included representatives from the [[United States Department of State]] and the White House [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]."&lt;ref name=Guardian2016-06-10/&gt;

''The Daily Beast'' reported that [[Natalia Veselnitskaya]], the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. four days earlier to criticize the [[Magnitsky Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apuzzo|first1=Matt|last2=Becker|first2=Jo|last3=Goldman|first3=Adam|last4=Haberman|first4=Maggie|title=Trump Jr. Was Told in Email of Russian Effort to Aid Campaign|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-russia-email-candidacy.html|access-date=July 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; paid for and attended the Newseum screening, to which Congressman [[Dana Rohrabacher]], a senior member of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Committee on Foreign Affairs]], was invited to "try to recruit him to the Russian cause."&lt;ref name=Beast2017-07-25&gt;{{cite news|last=Zavadski|first=Katie|date=July 25, 2017|title=How an Anti-Putin Filmmaker Became a Kremlin Stooge|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/dissident-director-helped-trumps-russia-comrade-attack-us|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When management refused to cancel the event, ''The Nation'' wrote that "the Newseum deserves great credit for sticking to its principles," adding that "the film provides a valuable service by asking how it is that American (and European) officials bought Browder's story without doing even the slightest due diligence. The American and European legislators who took Browder's version of events on faith now look credulous, at best."&lt;ref name=Nation2016-06-20/&gt;

''The Washington Post'', however, editorialized, "The film is a piece of [[agitprop]] that mixes fact and fiction to blame Magnitsky for the fraud and absolve Russians of blame for his death."&lt;ref name=WaPo2016-06-19/&gt; According to ''The Post'', "Mr. Nekrasov declares, 'Magnitsky wasn't a whistleblower. Magnitsky did not accuse any police officers. Magnitsky did not even investigate anything.' He adds, 'The young man died in a Russian prison. I do not believe it was murder. It was a case of negligence and the Russian system is to blame in many ways, but it wasn't murder; he wasn't murdered by the Russian state as Mr. Browder claims.' This is just what President [[Vladimir Putin]] and his honchos want the West to hear."&lt;ref name=WaPo2016-06-19/&gt;

''The Post'' predicted, "The film won't grab a wide audience but it offers yet another example of the Kremlin's increasingly sophisticated efforts to spread its illiberal values and mind-set abroad. In the European Parliament and on French and German television networks, showings were put off recently after questions were raised about the accuracy of the film, including by Magnitsky's family. We don't worry that Mr. Nekrasov's film was screened here, in an open society. But it is important that such slick spin be fully exposed for its twisted story and sly deceptions."&lt;ref name=WaPo2016-06-19/&gt;

The woman then rests at her parents' home for the final weeks of her pregnancy.

The purpose of the ceremony is to honour and protect the pregnant woman, who is seen as vulnerable to the evil eye, malign spirits and ghosts, and to ensure the birth of a healthy child. Valaikaapu was originally a simple ceremony, mainly limited to the exchange of bangles. But as valaikaapu became more widely practiced, it grew more lavish, and since the 1980s has been celebrated by most, according to anthropologists who have studied the practice, with "magnificence and sumptuousness," with gifts including jewellery, saris, household appliances, mobile phones and gold ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petitet|first=Pascale Hancart|author2=Pragathi Vellore |title=Ethnographical views on valaikappu.

The '''Yngsjö murder''' occurred on 28 March 1889 in [[Yngsjö]], [[Sweden]]. Hanna Johansdotter (born 1867) was murdered by her husband Per Nilsson and his mother Anna Månsdotter (born 28 December 1841), who became known as '''''Yngsjömörderskan''''' (in English: The Yngsjö Murderess). Both were sentenced to death for the murder, and Månsdotter became the last woman in Sweden to be executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monaper.se/Yngsjomordet.htm |title=Yngsjömordet |first= |last= |work=monaper.se |year= |accessdate=28 March 2011 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812020556/http://www.monaper.se/Yngsjomordet.htm |archivedate=August 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circumstances ==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
The circumstances of the murder are not entirely clear, as both Månsdotter and her son gave several different explanations for it. In later years it has been suggested that she carried out the murder alone. During the trial it came to light that she had a sexual relationship with her son, and that this eventually led to the murder. It is believed that she murdered her daughter-in-law because of jealousy, and that she did this with her son's consent.

Anna Månsdotter had married Nils Nilsson, 13 years her elder, expecting a wealthy future, but they had become poor and afflicted with debts. She had three children, of which only one, her son Per, lived to adulthood. Anna's spouse Nils died in 1883. She had arranged the marriage between Per and Hanna Johansdotter, possibly as a way to prevent the spread of rumours about incest. The marriage was not a happy one. Anna did not move in with her own mother, which had been the initial plan, and Hanna complained to her father that her mother-in-law was the cause of her unhappy marriage. One suggestion is that Hanna had discovered the sexual relationship between her husband and his mother, and that they together murdered her to prevent her from being able to tell anyone. One of many summaries given of the murder was that they beat her with a piece of wood, after which Anna strangled her. They then dressed her and placed her as if she had fallen down the stairs.

Månsdotter was executed on the district jail grounds in [[Kristianstad]] on 7 August 1890 by executioner [[Albert Gustaf Dahlman]]. Per Nilsson was pardoned from his death sentence and was instead sentenced to hard labour for the rest of his life. He was however released in 1913 and died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buf.kristianstad.se/trolle/3_5/Yngsjomordet.html |title=Yngsjömordet |first= |last= |work=Buf.kristianstad.se |year=2005 |accessdate=28 March 2011 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328125638/http://www.buf.kristianstad.se/trolle/3_5/Yngsjomordet.html |archivedate=March 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
