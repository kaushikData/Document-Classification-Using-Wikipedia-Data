==History==
AC Tripoli was initially founded as '''Olympic Beirut''' winning the 2003 [[Lebanese Football League]] and appearing in AFC Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.national-football-teams.com/club/1480/2002_1/Olympic_Beirut.html|title=Olympic Beirut (02/03)|last=Strack-Zimmermann|first=Benjamin|website=www.national-football-teams.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tams Brig Greyhound Stadium''' was a [[Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom|greyhound racing]] stadium in [[Ayr]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/234029/623062/12/101167|title=OS County Series Ayrshire 1937-1938|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tams Brig track, also known as Ayr Greyhound Stadium, was located between Limekiln Road and Elmbank Street, and was overlooked by the houses that ran along Elmbank Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/fellina/4590004834|title=Ayr Greyhound Stadium|publisher=Flickr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first race was on 16 December 1933 and racing took place on Monday and Saturday evenings at 7pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Scottish companies, 13 October|year=1933|newspaper=Edinburgh Evening News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amenities included a large licensed club and sixteen on-course bookmakers. The circumference was tight because it was 300 yards with race distances of 250, 400 &amp; 550 yards. 
The circuit was changed to all sand in the late sixties, and the starting traps and photo finish were constructed by the stadium staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furby|first=R|title=Independent Greyhound Racing|page =76|year=1968|publisher=New Dominion House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tams Brig was active for 39 years until 30 December 1972, when it was replaced by the Ayr Curling Club and ice rink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =409|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville''' is a [[baseball park]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. It is the home stadium of the [[Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp]] baseball team, who play in the Class [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]]. The facility opened in 2003.

==History==
The Baseball Grounds were proposed as part of the city planning program known as the [[Better Jacksonville Plan]]. It was designed to replace the aging [[Wolfson Park]], the Jumbo Shrimp's previous home. The facility cost $34 million and broke ground in 2002, with construction being completed the following year.&lt;ref name="bbp"/&gt;

The ballpark was the first completed project of the [[Better Jacksonville Plan]]. The [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] baseball championship was held at the venue from 2005–2008. The [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] won the first ACC Tournament at the Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville, followed by the [[Clemson Tigers]] in 2006, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels]] in 2007, and the [[Miami Hurricanes]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="bbp"/&gt;

The Baseball Grounds hosts an annual game between the [[Florida Gators baseball|Florida Gators]] and the [[Florida State Seminoles baseball|Florida State Seminoles]]. The most recent game was on March 27, 2018 when Florida defeated Florida State 1–0 in front of 9,613 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gators rely on pitching to eke out a 1-0 victory over Seminoles|first=Garry|last=Smits|url=http://www.jacksonville.com/sports/20180327/gators-rely-on-pitching-to-eke-out-1-0-victory-over-seminoles|newspaper=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|publisher=[[Gatehouse Media]]|date=March 27, 2018|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 2013 the Baseball Grounds hosted the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] All-Star Game. The South Division defeated the North Division 6–0 in front of a crowd of 9,373.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=South Shuts Out North in Southern League All-Star Game|first=Jeff|last=Elliott|url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/baseball/2013-07-18/story/south-shuts-out-north-southern-league-all-star-game|newspaper=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|publisher=[[Morris Communications]]|date=July 17, 2013|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
[[File:Baseball grounds of jacksonville national map.jpg|thumbnail|left|Seen from space.]]
It has nearly 6,000 stadium-style chairs and can accommodate more than 11,000 fans, the highest capacity in all of Double-A baseball, with an old-fashioned design, brick facade and a grass seating berm and bleacher seating. It also features 12 luxury skyboxes, four skydecks, a large scoreboard and videoboard, a playground, and the "knuckle," a unique {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} mound for seating at the left field corner. Other ballpark features include a souvenir shop, first aid facility, various seating levels and perspectives, an ample number of restrooms and concession areas, first-class in-seat concession services behind home plate, wide concourse and seating aisles and a state-of-the-art video scoreboard in left center field.&lt;ref name="bbp"/&gt;

The park has an in-house video broadcast of games provided by The Schelldorf Television Network. The ballpark is located in downtown Jacksonville, situated between [[Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena]] and [[TIAA Bank Field]].&lt;ref name="bbp"/&gt;

==Attendance records==
The largest crowd for a baseball game at the ballpark was 12,943, which occurred on April 11, 2003 during the grand opening of the park in a game between the Jacksonville Suns and the Huntsville Stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jacksonville Suns Media Guide|url=http://www.milb.com/documents/7/0/0/169962700/Jacksonville_2016_Media_Guide_zil383im.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37422">The '''Color Line''', also known as the '''Color Barrier''', in American [[baseball]] excluded players of [[Black African]] descent from [[Major League Baseball]] and its affiliated [[Minor League Baseball|Minor Leagues]] until 1947 (with a few notable exceptions in the 19th century before the line was firmly established). [[Racial segregation]] in professional baseball was sometimes called a [[gentlemen's agreement]], meaning a tacit understanding, as there was no written policy at the highest level of organized baseball, the major leagues.  But a high minor league's vote in 1887 against allowing new contracts with black players within its league sent a powerful signal that eventually led to the disappearance of blacks from the sport's other minor leagues later that century, including the low minors.

After the line was in virtually full effect in the early 20th century, many black baseball clubs were established, especially during the 1920s to 1940s when there were several [[Negro Leagues]]. During this period some light-skinned [[Hispanic]] players, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s, and [[native Hawaiian]]s, like [[Prince Oana]], were able to play in the Major Leagues.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The color line was broken for good when [[Jackie Robinson]] signed with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] organization for the 1946 season. In 1947, both Robinson in the [[National League]] and [[Larry Doby]] with the [[American League]]'s [[Cleveland Indians]] appeared in games for their teams. By the late 1950s, the percentage of black players on Major League teams matched or exceeded that of the general population.

==Origins==
[[File:William Edward White (1879).jpg|thumb|[[William Edward White]]]]
Formal beginning of segregation followed the baseball season of 1867. On October 16, the Pennsylvania State Convention of Baseball in Harrisburg denied admission to the "colored" Pythian Baseball Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.philadelphiabaseballreview.com/pythian2.html |work= Philadelphia Baseball Review | title=On the field, Pythian baseball club was rivaled by few| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110513050519/http://www.philadelphiabaseballreview.com/pythian2.html| date= April 2008| first= Patrick|last= Gordon| archivedate= 2011-05-13 | accessdate=2013-08-30| quote= The Pythians finished 1867 with a 9–1 record but suffered a setback on October 16 in Harrisburg when the club applied and was denied admission into the Pennsylvania State Convention of Baseball, a state organization designed to promote a professional approach to the game. "The committee reported favorably on all credentials except for the ones presented by the Pythians, which theyintentionally neglected", noted author Michael Lomax. The National Association of Amateur Baseball Players upheld the Pennsylvania State Association's ruling and adopted a formal ban on the inclusion of black players and clubs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major League Baseball]]'s [[National League]], founded in 1876, had no black players in the 19th century, except for a recently discovered one, [[William Edward White]], who played in a single game in 1879 and who apparently passed for being white.  The National League and the other main major league of the day, the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]], had no written rules against having [[African American]] players.  In 1884, the American Association had two black players, [[Moses Fleetwood Walker]] and, for a few months of the season, his brother [[Weldy Walker]], both of whom played for the [[Toledo Blue Stockings]].[[File:Moses Fleetwood Walker.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Moses Fleetwood Walker]] of the [[Toledo Blue Stockings]], circa 1884.]]

The year before, in 1883, prominent National League player [[Cap Anson]] had threatened to have his Chicago team sit out an exhibition game at then-minor league Toledo if Toledo's Fleet Walker played.  Anson backed down, but not before uttering the word ''nigger'' on the field and vowing that his team would not play in such a game again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Husman |first=John R. |title=August 10, 1883: Cap Anson vs. Fleet Walker |url=https://sabr.org/gamesproj/game/august-10-1883-cap-anson-vs-fleet-walker}} the Society for American Baseball Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, the Chicago club made a successful threat months in advance of another exhibition game at Toledo, to have Fleet Walker sit out.  In 1887, Anson made a successful threat by telegram before an exhibition game against the Newark Little Giants of the International League that it must not play its two black players, Fleet Walker and pitcher George Stovey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mancuso |first=Peter |title=July 14, 1887: The color line is drawn |url=https://sabr.org/gamesproj/game/july-14-1887-color-line-drawn}}, the Society for American Baseball Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of players such as Anson and the general racism in society led to segregation efforts in professional baseball. On July 14, 1887, the high-minor International League voted to ban the signing of new contracts with black players.  By a 6-to-4 vote, the league’s entirely white teams voted in favor and those with at least one black player voted in the negative.  The Binghamton, N.Y., team, which had just released its two black players, voted with the majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Howard W.|title=Fantasy Baseball: The Momentous Drawing of the Sport’s 19th-Century 'Color Line' is still Tripping up History Writers,|url= https://howardwrosenberg.atavist.com/racism-bbhistory}} The Atavist, June 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Right after the vote, the sports weekly Sporting Life stated, “Several representatives declared that many of the best players in the league are anxious to leave on account of the colored element, and the board finally directed Secretary [C.D.] White to approve of no more contracts with colored men.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|title=Fantasy Baseball,}}ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the afternoon of the International League vote, Anson’s Chicago team played the game in Newark alluded to above, with Stovey and the apparently injured Walker sitting out. Anson biographer Howard W. Rosenberg, concluded that, “A fairer argument is that rather than being an architect [of segregation in professional baseball, as the late baseball racism historian Jules Tygiel termed Anson in his 1983 Baseball’s Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and His Legacy], that he was a reinforcer of it, including in the National League – and that he had no demonstrable influence on changing the course of events apart from his team’s exhibition-game schedule.” The year 1887 was also the high point of achievement of blacks in the high minor leagues, and each National League team that year except for Chicago played exhibition games against teams with black players, including against Newark and other International League teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|title=Fantasy Baseball,}} ibid., in part citing, for exhibition game data, {{cite web|last=Bond|first=Gregory|title=Jim Crow at Play: Race, Manliness, and the Color Line in American Sports, 1876–1916|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcaWQQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Jim+Crow+at+Play:+Race,+Manliness,+and+the+Color+Line+in+American+Sports,+1876-1916%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj86ZnH6o7WAhVD6oMKHemCDRMQ6AEIJjAA}}, dissertation, Doctor of Philosophy (History), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Anson’s notoriety stems from a 1907 book on early blacks in baseball by black minor league player and later black semi-professional team manager Sol White, who was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2006.  White claimed that, “Were it not for this same man Anson, there would have been a colored player in the National League in 1887.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Howard W.|title=Cap Anson 4: Bigger Than Babe Ruth: Captain Anson of Chicago|publisher=Tile Books|year=2006|isbn=978-0-9725574-3-6}}, pp. 423, 425–30 and {{cite web|last=Rosenberg|title=Fantasy Baseball,}}ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After the 1887 season, the International League retained just two blacks for the 1888 season, both of whom were under contracts signed before the 1887 vote, [[Frank Grant]] of the Buffalo Bisons and [[Moses Fleetwood Walker]] of the Syracuse franchise, with Walker staying in the league for most of 1889.

In September 1887, eight members of the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (1875–1919)#Drawing the color line in baseball (1887)|St. Louis Browns]] of the then-major American Association (who would ultimately change their nickname to the current [[St. Louis Cardinals]]) staged a mutiny during a road trip, refusing to play a game against the New York Cuban Giants, the first all-black professional baseball club, and citing both racial and practical reasons:  that the players were banged up and wanted to rest so as to not lose their hold on first place.  At the time, the St. Louis team was in Philadelphia, and a story that ran in the Philadelphia Times stated that “for the first time in the history of base ball the color line has been drawn."

Blacks were gone from the high minors after 1889 and a trickle of them were left in the minor leagues within a decade.  Besides White’s single game in 1879, the lone blacks in major league baseball for around 75 years were Fleet Walker and his brother Weldy, both in 1884 with Toledo.

A big change would take place starting in 1946, when Jackie Robinson played for the [[Montreal Royals]] in the International League.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/27/sports/27hall.html?pagewanted=2&amp;sq=jackie%20robinson%202006&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=18 "Breaking a Barrier 60 Years Before Robinson,"] ''The New York Times'', July 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Covert efforts at integration==
[[File:Chief Bender, Philadelphia Athletics pitcher, by Paul Thompson, 1911.jpg|thumb|upright|Chief Bender]]
While professional baseball was formally regarded as a strictly white-men-only affair, the racial color bar was directed against black players exclusively. Other races were allowed to play in professional white baseball. One example was [[Charles Albert Bender]], a star pitcher for the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] in 1910. Bender was the son of a [[Chippewa]] Indian mother and a German father and had the inevitable nickname "Chief" from the white players.&lt;ref name="Fifty Million"&gt;{{cite episode | title=The Faith of Fifty Million People: Top of the 3rd Inning (First half of the third episode) | series=Ken Burns's Baseball | airdate=September 20, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this exclusive treatment of black players, deceptive tactics were used by managers to sign African Americans, including several attempts, with the player's acquiescence, to sign players who they knew full well were African American as Native Americans despite the ban. In 1901, [[John McGraw]], manager of the [[New York Yankees#Origins in Baltimore (1901–1902)|Baltimore Orioles]], tried to add [[Charlie Grant]] to the roster as his second baseman. He tried to get around the Gentleman's Agreement by trying to pass him as a [[Cherokee]] Indian named Charlie Tokohama. Grant went along with the charade. However, in Chicago Grant's African American friends who came to see him try out gave him away and Grant never got an opportunity to play ball in the big leagues.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Burns's ''Baseball' "Something Like a War" Top of the second inning (first half of episode two) Original airdate: Monday, September 19, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 1916, [[British Columbian]] [[Jimmy Claxton]] temporarily broke the professional baseball color barrier when he played two games for the [[Oakland Oaks (PCL)|Oakland Oaks]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]]. Claxton was introduced to the team owner by a part-Native American friend as a fellow member of an [[Oklahoma]] tribe. The Zee-Nut candy company rushed out a baseball card for Claxton.&lt;ref name="Fifty Million"/&gt; However, within a week, a friend of Claxton revealed that he had both Negro and [[First Nations|Indigenous Canadian]] ancestors, and Claxton was promptly fired.&lt;ref name=sportnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/aajoe7/76313/ |title=Sporting News |accessdate=2009-06-28 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be nearly thirty more years before another black man, at least one known to be black, played organized white baseball.

There possibly were attempts to have people of African descent be signed as Hispanics. One possible attempt may have occurred in 1911 when the [[Cincinnati Reds]] signed two light-skinned players from [[Cuba]], [[Armando Marsans]] and [[Rafael Almeida]]. Both of them had played "Negro Baseball", barnstorming as members of the integrated [[All Cubans]]. When questions arose about them playing the white man's game, the Cincinnati managers assured the public that "...they were as pure white as Castile soap."&lt;ref name="Fifty Million"/&gt;

The African American newspaper ''[[New York Age]]'' had this to say about the signings:

{{quote|Now that the first shock is over, it will not be surprising to see a Cuban a few shades darker breaking into the professional ranks. It would then be easier for colored players who '''are''' citizens of this country to get into fast company.&lt;ref name="Fifty Million"/&gt;}}

==The Negro leagues==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Rube-foster.jpg|thumb|upright|Rube Foster]] --&gt;
The [[Negro National League (the first)|Negro National League]] was founded in {{baseball year|1920}} by [[Rube Foster]], independent of Organized [[Baseball's National Commission]] (1903–1920). The NNL survived through 1931, primarily in the midwest, accompanied by the major [[Eastern Colored League]] for several seasons to 1928. "National" and "American" [[Negro league baseball|Negro leagues]] were established in 1933 and 1937 which persisted until integration. The [[Negro Southern League (1920–36)|Negro Southern League]] operated consecutively from 1920, usually at a lower level. None of them, nor any integrated teams, were members of Organized Baseball, the system led by Commissioner Landis from 1921. Rather, until {{baseball year|1946}} professional baseball in the United States was played in two racially segregated league systems, one on each side of the so-called color line. Much of that time there were two high-level "Negro major leagues" with a championship playoff or all-star game, as between the white major leagues.
&lt;!-- this still needs a lot of improvement. Among other things it should be made clear that the players alone were strictly segregated by race. The journalists and spectators were not segregated by race in that way. What about other employees such as umpires? --&gt;

==Kenesaw Mountain Landis==
[[File:Landis portrait-restored.png|thumb|left|upright|Kenesaw Mountain Landis]]
During his 1921&amp;ndash;1944 tenure as the first [[baseball commissioner]], [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] has been alleged to have been particularly determined to maintain the segregation.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It is possible that he was guided by his background as a federal judge, and specifically by the then-existing constitutional doctrine of "[[separate but equal]]" institutions (see ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'').{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} He himself maintained for many years that black players could not be integrated into the major leagues without heavily compensating the owners of Negro league teams for what would likely result in the loss of their investments.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In addition, integration at the major league level would likely have necessitated integrating the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]], which were much more heavily distributed through the rural [[Southern United States|U.S. South]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Although Landis had served an important role in helping to restore the integrity of the game after the [[Black Sox scandal|1919 World Series scandal]], his unyielding stance on the subject of baseball's color line was an impediment.{{according to whom|date=April 2016}}{{how|date=April 2016}}{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} His death in late 1944 was opportune, as it resulted in the appointment of a new Commissioner, [[Happy Chandler]], who was much more open to integration than Landis was.

==Bill Veeck and Branch Rickey==
The only serious attempt to break the color line during Landis' tenure came in {{baseball year|1942}}, when [[Bill Veeck]] tried to buy the then-moribund [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and stock them with Negro league stars.  However, when Landis got wind of his plans,&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Joseph Thomas|title=Pride and Prejudice: The Biography of Larry Doby|location=New York|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=1988|isbn=0275929841|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LjfGgiauBfcC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=larry+doby+joe+gordon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UIAF81sh-5&amp;sig=cQf3imU2tjd3xmzVsympiIf1jfE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q1AVUInrH6bZigffqoC4Dg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=larry%20doby%20joe%20gordon&amp;f=false|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; he and National League president [[Ford Frick]] scuttled it in favor of another bid by [[William D. Cox]].

In his autobiography, ''Veeck, as in Wreck'', in which he discussed his abortive attempt to buy the Phillies, Veeck also stated that he wanted to hire black players for the simple reason that in his opinion the best black athletes "can run faster and jump higher" than the best white athletes.&lt;ref name=Veeck&gt;''Veeck &amp;mdash; as in Wreck'', p. 171, by Bill Veeck with Ed Linn, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;  Veeck realized that there was no actual rule against integration; it was just an unwritten policy, a "Gentlemen's Agreement." Veeck stated that Landis and Frick prevented him from buying and thus integrating the Phillies, on various grounds.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The authors of a controversial article in the 1998 issue of SABR's ''The National Pastime'' argued that Veeck invented the story of buying the Phillies, claiming Philadelphia's black press made no mention of a prospective sale to Veeck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Baseball Myth Exploded | first = David M | last = Jordan | first2 = Larry R | last2 = Gerlach | first3 = John P | last3 =Rossi | url = http://www.sabr.org/cmsFiles/Files/Bill_Veeck_and_the_1943_sale_of_the_Phillies.pdf#search=%22veeck%20phillies%22 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, the article was strongly challenged by the late historian Jules Tygiel, who refuted it point-by-point in an article in the 2006 issue of SABR's ''The Baseball Research Journal'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.sabr.org/journals/files/SABR-Baseball_Research_Journal-35.pdf Revisiting Bill Veeck and the 1943 Phillies], ''The National Pastime'', 2006, p. 109. Retrieved 2012-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and in an appendix, entitled "Did Bill Veeck Lie About His Plan to Purchase the ’43 Phillies?", published in Paul Dickson's biography, ''Bill Veeck: Baseball's Greatest Maverick''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=Paul|title=Bill Veeck: Baseball's Greatest Maverick|year=2012|publisher=Walker &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8027-1778-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Thomas Moore wrote in his biography of Doby, "Bill Veeck planned to buy the Philadelphia Phillies with the as yet unannounced intention of breaking that color line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pride Against Prejudice: The Biography of Larry Doby|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York|page=19|year=1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LjfGgiauBfcC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=larry+doby+world+war+ii&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UIAF9-tq-8&amp;sig=VVx8s_kSPYFtVA4kJeIgbPKufZY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MpAWUNHpFs2TiQelu4GoCQ&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=larry%20doby%20world%20war%20ii&amp;f=false|first=Joseph Thomas|last=Moore|isbn=0275929841}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phillies ended up being the last National League team, and third-last team in the majors, to integrate, with [[John Kennedy (shortstop)|John Kennedy]] debuting for the Phillies in 1957, 15 years after Veeck's attempted purchase.

Around {{baseball year|1945}}, [[Branch Rickey]], General Manager of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], held tryouts of black players, under the cover story of forming a new team called the "Brooklyn Brown Dodgers." The Dodgers were, in fact, looking for the right man to break the color line. Rickey had an advantage in that he was already an employee of the Dodgers.  Also, Landis had died by this time and new commissioner [[Happy Chandler]] was more supportive of integrating the major leagues.

==Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby==
[[File:Jackie Robinson, Brooklyn Dodgers, 1954.jpg|thumb|[[Jackie Robinson]] in 1954]]
The color line was breached when Rickey, with Chandler's support, signed the African American player [[Jackie Robinson]] in October {{baseball year|1945}}, intending him to play for the Dodgers.  Chandler later wrote in his biography that although he risked losing his job as commissioner, he could not in good conscience tell black players they could not play with white players when they had fought alongside them in World War II.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}{{dubious|date=June 2018}}

After a year in the minor leagues with the Dodgers' top minor-league affiliate, the [[Montreal Royals]] of the [[International League]], Robinson was called up to the Dodgers in {{mlby|1947}}.  He endured epithets and death threats and got off to a slow start.  However, his athleticism and skill earned him the first ever [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award, which is now named in his honor.

Less well-known was [[Larry Doby]], who signed with Bill Veeck's [[Cleveland Indians]] that same year to become the [[American League]]'s first African American player. Doby, a more low-key figure than Robinson, suffered many of the same indignities that Robinson did, albeit with less press coverage. As baseball historian Daniel Okrent wrote, "Robinson had a two year drum roll, Doby just showed up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Larry Doby: The Struggle of the American League's First Black Player|last1=Moore|first1=Joseph Thomas|last2=Dickson|first2=Paul|year=1988|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=9780486483375|page=x|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-PEkiSAQMAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men were ultimately elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] on the merits of their play. Willard Brown played briefly in 1947 for the St. Louis Browns and was the first African American player to hit a home run in the American league. He too was elected to the Hall of Fame based on his career in the Negro Leagues. Due to their success, teams gradually integrated African Americans on their rosters.  (Almost a dozen years after his 1947 debut, Doby would become the first American player of African descent to appear for the [[Detroit Tigers]], on April 10, 1959.)

Prior to the integration of the major leagues, the Brooklyn Dodgers led the integration of the minor leagues. Jackie Robinson and [[Johnny Wright (baseball)|Johnny Wright]] were assigned to Montreal, but also that season [[Don Newcombe]] and [[Roy Campanella]] became members of the [[Nashua Dodgers]] in the class-B [[New England League]]. Nashua was the first minor-league team based in the United States to integrate its roster after {{baseball year|1898}}. Subsequently that season, the Pawtucket Slaters, the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]' New England League franchise, also integrated its roster, as did Brooklyn's class-C franchise in [[Trois-Rivières|Trois-Rivières, Quebec]]. With one exception, the rest of the minor leagues would slowly integrate as well, including those based in the [[southern United States]]. The [[Carolina League]], for example, integrated in {{baseball year|1951}} when the [[Danville Leafs]] signed [[Percy Miller Jr.]] to their team.

The exception was the Class AA [[Southern Association]]. Founded in 1901 and based in the Deep South, it allowed only one black player, [[Nat Peeples]] of the 1954 [[Atlanta Crackers]], a brief appearance in the league.  Peeples went [[hit (baseball)|hitless]] in two [[games played]] and four [[at bats]] on April 9–10, 1954, was demoted one classification to the [[Jacksonville Braves]] of the [[Southern League (baseball)|Sally League]], and the SA reverted to white-only status. As a result, its major-league parent clubs were forced to field all-white teams during the 1950s. By the end of the 1950s, the SA also was boycotted by [[Civil Rights Movement|civil rights leaders]]. The Association finally ceased operation after the 1961 season, still a bastion of segregation. Its member teams joined the International, [[Southern League (baseball)|Sally]] and [[Texas League|Texas]] leagues, which were all racially integrated.

==Reluctance of Boston Red Sox==
&lt;!-- This section seems biased. According to statistics, by the 1960s black were OVER-represented in baseball, compared to the general population. See chart in the next section. --&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was allegedly due to the steadfast resistance provided by team owner [[Tom Yawkey]]. In April 1945, the Red Sox refused to consider signing [[Jackie Robinson]] (and future Boston Braves outfielder [[Sam Jethroe]]) after giving him a brief tryout at [[Fenway Park]].&lt;ref name=Npr2002/&gt; The tryout, however, was a farce chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore Muchnick.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Simon|Simon]], pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson was subjected to racial epithets.&lt;ref name=Npr2002/&gt; Robinson left the tryout humiliated.&lt;ref name=Bryantp31&gt;[[#Bryant|Bryant]], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson would later call Yawkey "one of the most bigoted guys in baseball".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/redsox/williams/july_9/the_unsung_impact_of_ted_s_clout+.shtml |title= Ted Williams: A life remembered |publisher= Boston.com |accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boston city councilor Isadore Muchnick further spurred the Robinson tryout by threatening to revoke the team's exemption from Sunday [[blue law]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The segregation policy was enforced by Yawkey's general managers: [[Eddie Collins]] (through 1947), and [[Joe Cronin]] (1948&amp;ndash;58). A [[List of American League pennant winners|pennant]] winning team in [[1946 Boston Red Sox season|1946]], the year before integration, the Red Sox would perpetually fail to make the playoffs for the next twenty seasons, with implications being that Boston shut itself out by ignoring the expanded talent pool of black players.

On April 7, 1959 during spring training, Yawkey and [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Bucky Harris]] were named in a lawsuit charging them with discrimination and the deliberate barring of black players from the Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' April 7, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The NAACP issued charges of "following an anti-Negro policy", and the [[Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination]] announced a public hearing on racial bias against the Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;Bleacher Report April 16, 2009 by Harold Friend&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Red Sox were forced to integrate, becoming the last [[expansion team|pre-expansion]] major-league team to do so when  Harris promoted [[Pumpsie Green]] from Boston's AAA [[farm system|farm club]]. On July 21, Green debuted for the team as a [[pinch runner]], and would be joined later that season by [[Earl Wilson (baseball)|Earl Wilson]], the second black player to play for the Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IRs-CCUZhwAC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=earl+wilson+second+black+player+for+red+sox&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9Xi8AVwI5L&amp;sig=mRtVDgnne4e0XGst4d9ODprHp8k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yLZ9Uar4HZi64APNzIHoBQ&amp;ved=0CH0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=earl%20wilson%20second%20black%20player%20for%20red%20sox&amp;f=false |title=The Red Sox Encyclopedia |work=Google Books |accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early to mid 1960s, the team added other players of color to their roster including [[Joe Foy]], [[José Tartabull]], [[George Scott (first baseman)|George Scott]], [[George Smith (second baseman)|George Smith]], [[John Wyatt (baseball)|John Wyatt]], [[Elston Howard]] and [[Reggie Smith]]. The [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|1967 Red Sox]] went on to win the "Impossible Dream" pennant but lost to the [[1967 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games in that year's [[1967 World Series|World Series]].

Tom Yawkey died in 1976, and his widow [[Jean Yawkey]] eventually sold the team to [[Haywood Sullivan]] and [[Edward "Buddy" LeRoux]]. As chief executive, Haywood Sullivan found himself in another racial wrangle that ended in a courtroom. The [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks]] Club of [[Winter Haven, Florida]], the Red Sox [[spring training]] home, did not permit black members or guests. Yet the Red Sox allowed the Elks into their clubhouse to distribute dinner invitations to the team's white players, coaches, and business management. When the African-American [[Tommy Harper]], a popular former player and [[coach (baseball)|coach]] for Boston, then working as a minor league instructor, protested the policy and a story appeared in the ''Boston Globe'', he was promptly fired. Harper sued the Red Sox for racial discrimination and his complaint was upheld on July 1, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Howard, ''Shut Out: A Story of Race and Baseball in Boston.''

The under-representation of African-American players in U.S. baseball ended during the early years of the [[civil rights movement]], but their representation has fallen in recent years{{when|date=January 2017}} and as of 2010 was lower than in 1959 when the hiring of black players was still very controversial.

Coach Ernie Banks filled in as manager for two innings of the 12-inning 3–2 win over the [[San Diego Padres]]. The [[Sporting News]] ''Official Baseball Guide'' prior to the 1974 season stated flatly that on May 8, "Ernie Banks became the major leagues' first black manager, but only for a day" (page 129). The other two regular coaches on the team were absent that day, opening this door for Banks for the one occasion, but Banks never became a manager on a permanent basis.

'''Boston Garden''' was an [[arena]] in [[Boston]], United States. Designed by boxing promoter [[Tex Rickard]], who also built the third iteration of New York's [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]], it opened on November 17, 1928 as "Boston Madison Square Garden" (later shortened to just "Boston Garden") and outlived its original namesake by 30 years. It was above [[North Station]], a train station which was originally a hub for the [[Boston and Maine]] Railroad and is now a hub for [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[MBTA Commuter Rail|Commuter Rail]] and [[Amtrak]] trains.

The Garden hosted home games for the [[Boston Bruins]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[Boston Celtics]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), as well as rock concerts, amateur sports, [[boxing]] and [[professional wrestling]] matches, circuses, and ice shows. It was also used as an exposition hall for political rallies such as the speech by [[John F. Kennedy]] in November 1960. Boston Garden was demolished in 1998, three years after the completion of its new successor arena, [[TD Garden]].

==History==

===Founding===
Tex Rickard, the noted entrepreneur and boxing promoter who built and operated the [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|third Madison Square Garden]], sought to expand his empire by building seven "Madison Square Gardens" around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BACKTALK; The Last Days of a Garden Where Memories Grew|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F6061FF6345A0C758DDDAD0894DD494D81|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 16, 1995|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 1927, [[Homer Loring]], chairman of the [[Boston &amp; Maine Railroad]], announced that plans had been finalized for the construction of a new [[North Station]] facility, which would include a sports arena. A group led by Rickard, [[John S. Hammond]], and William F. Carey of the Madison Square Garden Corporation, as well as Boston businessmen [[Charles Adams (ice hockey)|Charles F. Adams]] and [[Huntington Hardwick]], signed a 25-year lease for the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coliseum Will Top New Boston Station|work=The Boston Daily Globe|date=November 16, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheldon Fairbanks]] was chosen to be the arena's first general manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fairbanks Arena Manager.|work=The New York Times|date=June 8, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boston &amp; Maine shareholder Edmund D. Codman challenged the legality of the railroad constructing a non-railroad building. The [[Massachusetts General Court]] passed legislation expanding the corporate powers of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad which was signed by Governor [[Alvan T. Fuller]] on March 6, 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gov Fuller Signs B. &amp; M. Arena Bill|work=The Boston Daily Globe|date=March 7, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Codman's [[Bill in equity]] was dismissed by [[Massachusetts Supreme Court]] Justice [[John B. Crosby]] in October 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boston &amp; Maine Decree Dismissed|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=October 5, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built at a cost of $10 million – over double the cost for New York's arena three years earlier – Boston Garden turned out to be the last of Rickard's proposed series, a decision fueled by high costs and Rickard's death in 1929.

The Garden's first event was on November 17, 1928, a boxing card headlined by Boston Native "Honey Boy" Dick Finnegan's defeat of [[Andre Routis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Routis is Defeated by Honeyboy Finnegan|work=The New York Times|date=November 18, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first team sporting event was held three days later, an [[ice hockey]] game between the Bruins and the [[Bruins-Canadiens rivalry|archrival]] [[Montreal Canadiens]], won by the Canadiens 1–0. The game was attended by 17,000 fans, 2,000 over capacity, as fans without tickets stormed their way in. The game started 25 minutes late. Windows and doors were broken by the fans in the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weekes|first=Don|title=The Best and Worst of Hockey's Firsts: The Unofficial Guide|year=2003|publisher=Greystone Books|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-55054-860-0|pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Early years===
During the Boston Garden's early years, the arena was owned by the Boston and Maine Corporation and controlled by Rickard and the [[Madison Square Garden]]. In 1934, the [[Madison Square Garden]] Corporation sold its interest in the Boston Garden to the [[Boston Arena]] Corporation, led by [[Henry G. Lapham]]. This resulted in the creation of the [[Boston Garden-Arena Corporation]].&lt;ref name="House of Magic" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurwitz&gt;{{cite news|last=Hurwitz|first=Hy|title=Garden-Arena Plan Adopted|newspaper=Boston Daily Globe|date=September 7, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George V. Brown]] served as general manager of the Garden under the Boston Garden-Arena Corporation until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by his son, [[Walter A. Brown]].&lt;ref name="House of Magic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crocket|first1=Douglas S.|title=Eddie Powers and his House of Magic: A remembrance of 45 years at the Boston Garden|work=The Boston Globe|date=March 18, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early years of the Boston Garden, the building's main draws were boxing, wrestling, and Bruins hockey. [[Johnny Indrisano]], [[Lou Brouillard]], [[Ernie Schaaf]], [[Al Mello]], and [[Jack Sharkey]] were among the boxers who fought at the Boston Garden. Wrestling became big due to the popularity of [[Gus Sonnenberg]]. Sonnenberg defeated [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed "Strangler" Lewis]] at the Garden in 1929 in a fight that set an attendance record for a wrestling match (19,500) and drew a record gate ($77,000). [[Paul Bowser]] promoted wrestling in Boston at this time and when the sport began to lose popularity, he brought [[Danno O'Mahony]] from Ireland to Boston. O'Mahony became a popular draw at the Garden.&lt;ref name="House of Magic" /&gt;

In 1930, construction on the [[Hotel Manger]], a 500-room hotel connected to the Boston Garden through an elevated [[skyway]], was completed. The hotel (later known as the Hotel Madison) closed in 1976 and was demolished in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thewestendmuseum.org/the-hotel-mangermadison/ |title=The West End Museum — The Hotel Manger/Madison | date= |website=thewestendmuseum.org |publisher=The [[West End Museum]] |access-date=December 5, 2015 |quote=The 500-room Hotel Manger opened at North Station in August 1930. Its design was an example of the Moderne style of architecture, developed by Boston native Louis Sullivan. Adjacent to Boston's North Station and directly connected to the Boston Garden, the Hotel Manger was a prominent and convenient destination for celebrities, show-goers and other travelers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.wgbh.org/post/bright-and-dark-days-bostons-madison-hotel |title=The Bright And Dark Days Of Boston's Madison Hotel |last=Herwick |first=Edgar B. III |date=May 16, 2014 |website=wgbh.org |publisher=WGBH News |access-date=March 12, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Garden suffered economically during the [[Great Depression]]. Boxing was at a low point in Boston, as fighters chose to work in other cities, wrestling attendance was down, and hockey attendance waned after [[Ace Bailey]] suffered a severe head injury at the hands of Bruin [[Eddie Shore]] in 1933. During this period [[Sonja Henie]]'s Hollywood Ice Revue and the [[Ice Follies]] were successful draws and kept the Garden afloat. In 1939, a financial dispute between Henie and her managers led Walter Brown and eight other arena managers to found the [[Ice Capades]].&lt;ref name="House of Magic" /&gt;

==Design==
Rickard built the arena specifically with boxing in mind, believing every seat should be close enough to see the "sweat on the boxers' brows". Because of this design theme, fans were much closer to the players during Bruins and Celtics games than in most arenas, leading to a distinct hometown advantage. This physical proximity also created spectacular acoustic effects, much like the [[Chicago Stadium]]. When teams made playoff appearances, and a sold-out crowd was chanting or screaming, the impact was enormous.

Due to the success of the Celtics in the 1980s, the Boston Garden was one of the most difficult buildings for visiting NBA teams. During the [[1985–86 NBA season|1985–86]] season, the Celtics were 40–1 at home, setting the NBA record for home court mastery (before the [[San Antonio Spurs]] tied the record 30 years later in the [[2015-16 NBA season|2015-16]] season). They also finished the post-season undefeated at home. Combined with the following regular season, the Celtics' Garden record was an amazing 79-3 between the 1985–86 and [[1986–87 NBA season|1986–87]] regular seasons.

While the [[Parquetry|parquet]] floor was an important part of the history of the Celtics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Celtics To Rip Up Parquet Floor|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-11-10/sports/9911100153_1_parquet-floor-new-floor-create-a-floor|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=November 10, 1999|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not originally part of the Garden. The parquet floor was built and installed in the aforementioned [[Matthews Arena|Boston Arena]] (first home of the Bruins hockey team) and moved to the Garden in 1952. It is said the Celtics knew which way the basketball would bounce off any section of the floor; this was one contributing factor to the Celtics' many NBA championships.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The floor became as much a part of Boston sports lore as the [[Green Monster]] of [[Fenway Park]]. The parquet floor was used at the FleetCenter until December 22, 1999. Portions of the original floor are integrated with new parquet.

The floor was cut into small pieces and sold as souvenirs along with seats and bricks. The Naden/Day Industries overhead scoreboard (which was electro-mechanical, not electronic, as more recent arenas used) hangs in the Boston Garden-themed food court of the [[Arsenal Mall]] in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]]. The Celtics' old championship banners and retired numbers now hang at the team's [[The Auerbach Center|now-former]] practice facility in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]; a new set of banners were made for the move to the FleetCenter (now [[TD Garden]]). Likewise, the Bruins made a new set of banners when they moved to the FleetCenter, which were again replaced after the [[2011 Stanley Cup Finals]] with six new banners, each using the contemporary logo of the Bruins when each Cup victory occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://board.uscho.com/showthread.php?96419-2011-NHL-Off-Season-The-Puck-Boat-edition&amp;s=796ddf9b58af3370cec78384b20de79f&amp;p=5202778&amp;viewfull=1#post5202778 |title=Re: 2011 NHL Off-Season: The Puck Boat edition |last=UNH GH |first= |date=September 13, 2011 |website=USCHO Fan Forum |publisher=USCHO.com |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flaws===
The Garden's hockey rink was undersized at {{convert|58.2|x|25.3|m|ft|order=flip}}, some nine feet shorter and two feet narrower than standard ({{convert|200|x|85|ft|m|disp=or|abbr=on|0}}), due to the rink being built at a time when the NHL did not have a standard size for rinks. This size was even smaller than the original Boston Arena's standard-length {{convert|200|x|80|ft|adj=on}} rink, [[Northeastern Huskies|still in use]] in the 21st century for [[Hockey East|college hockey]] with a new, widened {{convert|90|ft|adj=on}} upgrade in 1995, as the Boston Arena was the first rink to host the Bruins in 1924–25. Visiting players were frequently thrown off their games by the differing setup of the players' benches being on opposing sides of the ice, as well as the non-standard penalty box locations. The smaller ice surface allowed the Bruins to dump the puck in the offensive zone and then [[Forecheck|crush their opponents with checks]] along the boards. The shorter rink was well-suited to the rushing style of Bruins defenseman [[Bobby Orr]]; he was able to get from one end of the ice to another faster than in a standard-size rink. Its visitors' dressing room was notoriously small, hot, and underserved by plumbing.

The Garden's earlier [[Bulova]]-crafted "Sports Timer" game clock system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rireds.org/2010Website/photos_arenaclock.htm |title=The Arena Clock |publisher=Rhode Island Reds Heritage Society |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the typical analog dial-type game clock design of that era, said to have been installed at the Garden early in the 1940s, and [[Chicago Stadium#Last analog game clock in any NHL arena|essentially identical in appearance and function]] to the one used in the [[Chicago Stadium]] until September 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Langford |first=George |date=August 14, 1975 |title=Hakws' Johnston could report to camp on time/Tick, clock, tick (photo caption) |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1975/08/14/page/47/article/tick-clock-tick |newspaper=The Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago, IL USA |access-date=February 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was removed and replaced by an all-digital-display unit created by the Day Sign Company of [[Toronto]] in time for the [[1969–70 NHL season#Playoffs|1970 Stanley Cup playoffs]], and remained in use until the Garden's closure. Today the Garden's all-digital game clock is a public display in the [[Arsenal Yard]] in Watertown, Massachusetts.

The Garden had no air conditioning, resulting in [[fog]] forming over the ice during some Bruins' playoff games. During Game 5 of the [[1984 NBA Finals]], the {{convert|97|F}} heat in the facility was so intense that [[oxygen tank]]s were provided to exhausted players.

The Bruins' [[Stanley Cup]] finals appearances in [[1988 Stanley Cup Finals|1988]] and [[1990 Stanley Cup Finals|1990]] were both disrupted by power outages. On May 24, 1988, a power transformer in the [[North End, Boston|North End]] blew up during Game 4 of the Finals between the Bruins and the [[Edmonton Oilers]]: the contest was ruled a 3–3 tie. Two years later, on May 15, 1990, the lights went out during an overtime finals game between the same two teams. However, the lights were on an automatic timer and could be turned back on this time with the game ending with a 3–2 triple overtime win for the visiting Oilers.

==Notable events==

===Music===
[[Rudy Vallée]] and his orchestra performed at the Garden on April 21, 1932. Vallée returned to the Garden on October 23–24, 1938 for a "battle of the bands" with [[Benny Goodman]] that drew 25,000.&lt;ref name="House of Magic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horgan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horgan|first1=Sean|title=Even Churchill Had A Gig There|url=http://articles.courant.com/1994-11-27/sports/9411270335_1_garden-history-boston-garden-causeway-street|accessdate=August 28, 2016|work=Hartford Courant|date=November 27, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rock concert held at the Garden was on November 30, 1956, when the building hosted [[Alan Freed]]'s "Biggest Show of 1956".&lt;ref name="Horgan" /&gt;

[[The Beatles]] played a show at the Garden during their first US/Canada tour on September 12, 1964, staying at the then-attached [[Hotel Manger|Hotel Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;[[List of The Beatles' live performances]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Brown]] played a notable show at the Garden on April 5, 1968, the night after [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]]. Only 2,000 attended the sold-out show, because the mayor, [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]], and community leaders had encouraged people to obtain refunds on their tickets and instead to watch a hastily arranged television broadcast of the concert on the local public station [[WGBH-TV]]. Mayor White appeared on stage, asking the Garden audience and the city to peacefully remember King, and James Brown's words and presence was credited [[James Brown#The Boston Garden concert|with helping to keep the peace]] in Boston. WGBH rebroadcast the concert twice that night, an action which helped keep people off of the street at a time other major cities were erupting in riots.&lt;ref name="AP-Trott-1993-04-05"&gt;{{cite news |title=How Brown Soothed a City|first=Robert W.|last=Trott|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gOQyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jQcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6716,942138|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[The Free Lance–Star]]|location=Fredericksburg VA|date=April 5, 1993|accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was released on DVD as ''[[Live at the Boston Garden: April 5, 1968]]''.

[[Elvis Presley]] performed in Boston only once, at the Garden on November 10, 1971 pulling a full crowd of about 16,500 and receiving high praise from ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' journalist [[Jon Landau]] for his performance.

In 1972, [[The Rolling Stones]] were scheduled to perform at the Garden when two members were detained by Rhode Island police. Fearful that angry Stones fans (already in the Garden awaiting the show) would riot, mayor [[Kevin H. White]] intervened with the Rhode Island authorities and secured the musicians' release so they could play their set in Boston.&lt;ref name="stp-p258-278"&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenfield|first=Robert|title=S.T.P.: A Journey Through America with the Rolling Stones|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2002|isbn=0-306-81199-5|pages=258–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band had also played at the venue in 1965 and 1969 and would again in 1975.

In 1973, [[The Who]] were scheduled to perform at the Garden and nearly didn't perform due to the band being detained by police after destroying a hotel room in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, where they'd appeared the previous evening. The band was eventually released from jail and managed to arrive at the Garden in time for their show and took out their frustrations for being arrested the night before by delivering a blistering set and taunting the Montreal police, dedicating their performance of "[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]" to them. Who drummer [[Keith Moon]] (for the rest of the ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' tour) changed one of the lyrics to the song "Bell Boy" from "remember the gaff where the doors we smashed" to "remember Montreal at the hotel we trashed" or variations of the band being arrested. Almost three years later in March 1976, Moon collapsed at his drum kit during the second song "Substitute" after downing muscle relaxers and brandy before the show. The band had to reschedule the performance for early April and the rescheduled performance turned out to be one of The Who's best performances.

The Who's last performance at the Garden was in December 1979 on their first tour following Moon's death. That performance was almost canceled after several fans at a Who show in [[The Who concert disaster|Cincinnati]] died while trying to get in early for a general admission show. The Boston City Council held a televised hearing on whether to allow the show to go forward and decided to permit it because there was no general admission seating in Boston. The show was marred by a fan throwing a firecracker on stage, causing [[Pete Townshend]] to scream obscenities in the general direction of the source before getting on with the tension-filled show.

In 1975, [[Led Zeppelin]] were banned from performing at the Boston Garden after concert fans were allowed in the lobby due to sub-freezing temperatures while waiting for tickets to go on sale for the band's show. Turning on the generosity of their hosts, some of the fans rioted, broke into the Garden and trashed the seating area, the ice, and most of the refreshment stands, leading then-mayor White to cancel the upcoming show and ban the group for five years.

In 1976, [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] was banned from performing at the Garden because the band refused to comply with the venue's no pyrotechnic policy after fire marshals had watched their flamethrowers hit the ceiling at the Orpheum.

[[Pink Floyd]] were the first band to perform at the Boston Garden with a stage set that cost over $1 million on their 1977 ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' tour (they first played there in 1975 on the band's ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' tour). According to Pink Floyd drummer [[Nick Mason]]'s book ''Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd'', Pink Floyd almost got banned from the Boston Garden after their 1977 performances because the band, unknown to the venue's owners, used pyrotechnics during their performance (the exploding pig for "[[Pigs (Three Different Ones)]]" and firework displays on "[[Sheep (song)|Sheep]]" and "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]"). However, the band's road crew outsmarted the fire marshals by removing the pyro props quickly after they used them in the shows to prevent the band from being banned and also according to Mason's book since their manager had an Irish name ([[Steve O'Rourke]]), the band escaped being arrested. The band would not play the venue again, instead opting for the [[Providence Civic Center]] and [[Foxboro Stadium]] on their 1987/1988 and 1994 tours, respectively.

[[The Grateful Dead]] performed at the Boston Garden more times than any other band, with 24 performances from 1973 to 1994 (as an opener or middle of bill or headliner), and were intended to be the last band to play the Garden, with six shows scheduled for September 1995, which were canceled due to the death of Jerry Garcia on August 9, 1995. The Dead did not play at the Garden for a number of years following an incident in which they were caught grilling lobsters on a fire escape before a performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goodman|first=Fred|title=The Dead Again... and Again... and Again|journal=M Magazine|date=February 1992 |archiveurl=http://gopherproxy.meulie.net/nemesis.cs.berkeley.edu/00/interviews/M.article|archivedate=2000|url=http://nemesis.cs.berkeley.edu/00/interviews/M.article|accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grateful Dead have released ''[[Dick's Picks Volume 12]]'' and ''[[Dick's Picks Volume 17|17]]'' culled from performances at the Garden on 28 June 1974 and 25 September 1991.

Detroit rocker [[Bob Seger]] recorded a bulk of his 1981 double live album ''[[Nine Tonight]]'' at The Boston Garden in October 1980. Five years before, [[The J. Geils Band]] recorded most of their November, 1975 show at The Boston Garden for their 1976 double live album ''[[Blow Your Face Out]]''. The Geils band returned again, and had the historical distinction of being the first band in history to sell out a three-night stand in 1982 at the Garden featuring hometown favorites [[Jon Butcher#Jon Butcher Axis|Jon Butcher Axis]] as opening act.

Hometown band [[Aerosmith]] performed at the Boston Garden ten times from 1975 to 1995 and twice played [[New Year]]'s shows there, ringing in the 1990 and 1994 New Years.

Other acts that performed at the Garden include [[Pavarotti]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Liberace]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops]], [[U2]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Grace Slick]] with [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Bob Dylan]] with [[The Band]], [[Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes]], [[The Jackson 5]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and [[George Burns and Gracie Allen]] among others.&lt;ref name="Horgan" /&gt;

The opening of the [[DCU Center|Worcester Centrum]] and the [[Xfinity Center (Mansfield, Massachusetts)|Great Woods Amphitheater]] caused a massive drop in concerts at the Garden from the early 1980s until the early 1990s. The age of [[glam metal]] practically passed the Garden by completely, as most bands from that era played the Centrum in the winter and Great Woods in the summer. Poor acoustics, a busy sports schedule, expensive booking fees, and difficulty with local unions all contributed to the migration to more modern venues outside of Boston.

Under new Garden President Larry Moulter, bands started returning to the Garden in the late 1980s and early 1990s, highlighted by [[Pearl Jam]]'s multi-night stand in 1994, and the Dead's lengthy residences there before the Garden finally closed. The final [[New Year's Eve]] show at the Boston Garden was performed by the Vermont band [[Phish]] on December 31, 1994. On that night, the band rode a giant hot dog float above the audience; the hot dog is now in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[Cleveland]].

In addition to championship rounds, the Garden also hosted the [[NBA All-Star Game]] in 1951, 1952, 1957, and 1964, and the [[NHL All-Star Game]] in 1971. The NCAA [[Frozen Four]] was contested there from 1972 to 1974. Starting in 1955, the [[Beanpot (ice hockey)|Beanpot]] tournament, featuring the four major college hockey programs in the Boston area, was held at the Garden annually on the first week of February.

Boston Garden was the first arena to host the Stanley Cup Final and NBA Finals at the same time in 1957. It occurred again in 1958 and 1974.

The Boston Garden was a frequent host of Vince McMahon's [[WWE#World Wrestling Federation|WWF]] for many years throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in the form of wrestling "[[house show]]s", and superstars like [[Hulk Hogan]], [[André the Giant]], [[Randy Savage|Randy "Macho Man" Savage]], [[Tito Santana]], [[Ricky Steamboat|Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat]] and many others would regularly appear there. But despite this relationship, the Boston Garden was host to only one pro wrestling pay-per-view in its history: [[Survivor Series (1993)|the 1993 Survivor Series]]. The WWF held their final house show in the Boston Garden on May 13, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonwrestling.com/mwfnewsline20080513-dayinhistory.html|title=BOSTONWRESTLING.COM – MWF Newsline – This Day In Boston / Wrestling History – by Wrestling Historian The Jackal|work=bostonwrestling.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rallies and speeches===
The Boston Garden hosted many religious conclaves. Evangelists who appeared at the Garden include [[Aimee McPherson]] (1931), [[Billy Graham]] (1950) Bishop [[Fulton J. Sheen]] (1953), and [[Jimmy Swaggart]] (July 29–31, 1983).&lt;ref name="Horgan" /&gt;

The Garden was also the site of a number of political rallies. 20,000 people attended a 55th birthday celebration for President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on January 29, 1937. FDR also drew another 20,000 for a political rally 1940. On May 2, 1943, the night after the [[Hollywood Victory Caravan]] came through town, a Jewish anti-Nazi rally was held at the Garden. The United War Fund hosted a rally headlined by [[Jimmy Durante]], [[Greer Garson]], and the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]. The day before the 1960 presidential election, a rally for [[John F. Kennedy]] drew 20,000 while police estimated that there were another 100,000 people in the streets outside the Garden. Other politicians to hold rallies at the Garden include presidential candidates [[Thomas Dewey]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and former Boston mayor and Massachusetts governor [[James Michael Curley]].&lt;ref name="Horgan" /&gt;

Former Irish Prime Minister and President [[Éamon de Valera]] spoke at the Garden On March 24, 1948 (Easter Sunday). British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] spoke there March 31, 1949 as part of a [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Convocation.&lt;ref name="Horgan" /&gt;

==Final years==
By the early 1970s, Boston Garden was deteriorating. The building had no air conditioning and seats were obstructed by structural pillars. The seats were decades old and terribly cramped. With a capacity of less than 15,000, it was one of the country's smallest major league sports arenas. The Garden also lacked luxury suites, which had become an important and much-needed source of revenue for teams in professional sports. In 1972, Boston Mayor [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]] announced plans for a new 18,000-seat arena to be built near [[South Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Arena Being Eyed for Boston|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WXQhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yYgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4932,1972369&amp;dq|newspaper=[[The Schenectady Gazette]]|date=December 21, 1972|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plans for the arena fell through when [[Storer Broadcasting]], owner of the Boston Garden, announced they would not be able to pay the $24 to $28 million required for the new arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Storer Offers to Sell Bruins, Boston Garden|first=Ken|last=Cafarell|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=waArAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dfwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6944,3605186&amp;dq|newspaper=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|Nashua Telegraph]]|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=June 21, 1974|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977
the Boston Celtics negotiated with the city of [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] to have a $30 million, 21,000-seat arena built there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Celtics Considering New Arena At Quincy|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a18gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lmUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3261,1563433&amp;dq|newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Lewiston Evening Journal]]|date=May 12, 1977|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Boston Celtics owner [[Harry T. Mangurian, Jr.]] threatened to build a new arena unless the Boston Bruins, who owned the Garden, agreed to lower the rent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Celtics Seek Coach, Arena|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wGpEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZLIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1929,5626730&amp;dq|newspaper=AP|date=April 23, 1979|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team met with Ogden Corp., owners of [[Suffolk Downs]], who proposed a $20 million, 18,000-seat arena to be built near the racetrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celtics Owner Seeking New Arena|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s10gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EWUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3962,1596860&amp;dq|newspaper=|date=April 12, 1980|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also
met with the Boston Redevelopment Authority, who proposed $40 million, 15,000-seat arena that would be built behind the existing Garden and paid for with state bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boston Moving with New Arena|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qSodAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QaUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2276,6095151&amp;dq|newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Lewiston Journal]]|date=January 26, 1981|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bruins meanwhile announced plans to move to a proposed $50 million sports complex on the former site of [[Rockingham Park]] in [[Salem, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=$50 Million Sports Complex Planned|author=[[United Press International]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1lpDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yK0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1192,4801371&amp;dq|newspaper=Frederick Daily Leader|date=November 12, 1980|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans for the Salem site were eventually killed by the [[New Hampshire General Court]].&lt;ref name=Tsongas /&gt;

In response to the Bruins' plans to leave the state, U.S. Senator [[Paul Tsongas]] established a committee to put forward a plan for a new Boston arena. The committee, chaired by Tsongas, proposed a $56.8 million, 16,000 seat arena that would be paid for by tax-exempt bonds floated by an Arena Authority and by raising the commonwealth's hotel tax from 5.7% to 8%.&lt;ref name=Tsongas&gt;{{cite news |title=Boston Arena Plan Unveiled|author=[[United Press International]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z2lGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EukMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1022,1842305&amp;dq|newspaper=[[The Daily Gazette|The Schenectady Gazette]]|date=August 6, 1981|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naming rights to the proposed arena were sold to [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] for $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boston Arena Named|author=[[United Press International]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rkIwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7aQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3487,1278717&amp;dq|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]|date=August 14, 1981|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsongas' proposal died in the [[Massachusetts General Court|state legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dukakis Appoints Arena Committee|first=Andrew|last=Blake|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=June 14, 1983}}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 18, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Garden-owner [[Delaware North]] and developer Rosalind Gorin each submitted proposals for a new arena, hotel, and office development. Both proposals were rejected by the Boston Redevelopment Authority and Mayor [[Raymond Flynn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Another Day, Another New Garden Proposal|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2u8lAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=h_wFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3344,6173351&amp;dq|newspaper=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|Nashua Telegraph]]|date=November 21, 1986|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups later resubmitted plans, with Delaware North's calling for a renovation of the Garden instead of having it demolished.&lt;ref name=Gorin&gt;{{cite news |title=Boston Garden Replacements Sought|author=[[United Press International]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BcFHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=if8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1485,4497408&amp;dq|newspaper=[[Record-Journal]]|location=Meriden, Connecticut|date=June 20, 1986|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorin's plan called for the city to claim the Garden by eminent domain, as Delaware North refused to sell the Bruins and the Garden to a group led by Gorin, Paul Tsongas, and former Bruins [[Wayne Cashman]] and [[Bobby Orr]].&lt;ref name=Gorin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Group Headed by Orr Hoping to Buy Bruins|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xIhGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j_IMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4902,1722127&amp;dq|newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Lewiston Journal]]|date=February 13, 1986|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaware North was awarded the rights to construct the new arena, but poor economic conditions delayed the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boston Garden Owners Agree to Build New Boston Arena|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6q1JAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sA4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3218,1735834&amp;dq|newspaper=[[Bangor Daily News]]|date=January 6, 1989|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rowes Warfare|first1=Jerry|last1=Ackerman|first2=Richard|last2=Kindleberger|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=July 5, 1992}}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 19, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 1992, Delaware North announced they had secured funding for a new arena in the form of $120 million worth of loans evenly split among [[BankBoston|Bank of Boston]], [[FleetBoston Financial|Fleet Bank of Massachusetts]], and [[FleetBoston Financial|Shawmut National Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=After Long Wait, New Boston Garden Planned|first=Fox|last=Butterfield|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/08/us/after-long-wait-new-boston-garden-planned.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 8, 1992|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That December, a bill approving construction of the new arena was killed in the [[Massachusetts Senate]] by [[President of the Massachusetts Senate|Senate President]] [[William M. Bulger]]. Legislative leaders and Delaware North attempted to reach an agreement on plans for the new arena, but in February 1993 Delaware North owner [[Jeremy Jacobs]] announced he was backing out of the project as a result of the legislature's demand his company pay $3.5 million in "linkage payments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hopes for a New Boston Garden Dim With Political Quarreling|first=Fox|last=Butterfield|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/17/us/hopes-for-a-new-boston-garden-dim-with-political-quarreling.html?src=pm|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 17, 1993|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Hub on Causeway Construction (August 2018).jpg|thumb|right|Construction progress of The Hub on Causeway in August 2018.

Shawmut Bank purchased the naming rights for the new building with the intent of calling it the "Shawmut Center", but it was purchased by FleetBank before the new arena opened, and thus the "FleetCenter" opened on September 30, 1995. In 2005, the FleetCenter was renamed the "TD Banknorth Garden", as Bank of America had acquired Fleet Bank and relinquished its predecessor's naming rights, selling them to [[TD Banknorth]]. As of 2009, it is known as [[TD Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Garden Will Have a New Name – TD Garden|url=http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2009/04/garden_will_hav.html|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=April 15, 2009|accessdate=April 15, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103025004/http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2009/04/garden_will_hav.html|archivedate=November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sports Arena Name is Still Up in the Air|first=Ross|last=Kerber|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2008/07/24/suit_leads_td_banknorth_to_assume_new_identity?mode=PF|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=July 24, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last official game played at the Garden took place on Sunday, May 14, 1995. It was game five of an NHL Eastern Conference quarterfinal series between the Boston Bruins and [[New Jersey Devils]] where the New Jersey Devils beat the Bruins, 3–2, winning the series four games to one and eliminating the Bruins from the 1995 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The last event at the Boston Garden was a preseason game between the Boston Bruins and the Montreal Canadiens on September 26, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417113527/http://articles.philly.com/1995-09-26/sports/25719340_1_cba-boston-garden-memories|title=Finale Tonight For Boston Garden|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=September 26, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a special post-game ceremony, which included many former Bruins greats, the banners and retired numbers were removed. The Garden sat vacant for three years before it was demolished in 1998. The site where the building once stood is currently under construction for a commercial development known as [[TD Garden#The Hub on Causeway|The Hub on Causeway]].

'''Chunkey''' (also known as ''chunky'', ''chenco'',  ''tchung-kee'' or the ''hoop and stick game'' &lt;ref name="sierracanyon.pvt.k12.ca.us"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sierracanyon.pvt.k12.ca.us/school/chumash/games.html | title = Chumash Indians-Sports and Recreation| accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  is a [[game]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] origin. It was played by rolling disc-shaped stones across the ground and throwing spears at them in an attempt to land the spear as close to the stopped stone as possible. It originated around 600 CE in the [[Cahokia]] region of what is now the [[United States]] (near modern [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]). Chunkey was played in huge arenas as large as 47 acres (19 ha) that housed great audiences designed to bring people of the region together (i.e. Cahokians, farmers, immigrants, and even visitors).&lt;ref name="Pauketat 2004"&gt;{{cite book |  last = Pauketat | first = Timothy R.|  title = [[Ancient Cahokia and the Mississippians]]| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 2004 |  isbn = 0-521-52066-5 |  authorlink = Timothy Pauketat}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to be played after the fall of the [[Mississippian culture]] around 1500 CE. Variations were played throughout [[North America]]. Early ethnographer [[James Adair (historian)|James Adair]] translated the name to mean "running hard labor".&lt;ref name="Pauketat 2004"/&gt; [[Gambling]] was frequently connected with the game, with some players wagering everything they owned on the outcome of the game. Losers were even known to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Pauketat 2004"/&gt;

==Graphic representation==
[[File:chromesun digital chunkeyplayer 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chunkey player design taken from an engraved [[shell gorget]], showing motifs]]
The [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|falcon dancer/warrior/chunkey player]] was an important mythological figure from the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]]. Many different representations of the theme have been found all over the American Southeast and Midwest. Throughout the many different centuries of its portrayal, certain distinct motifs are repeated:
*''stance'' – Many graphic representations of the chunkey player show the participant in the act of tossing the stone roller.&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press"&gt;{{cite book |editors=F. Kent Reilly and James Garber |title=[[Ancient Objects and Sacred Realms]] |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |year=2004 |pages=56–106 |isbn=978-0-292-71347-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''broken stick'' – The chunkey stick is usually shown as a stripped stick, almost always broken. In the mythological cycle, this may signify that the game is over, if not defeat itself. Chunkey sticks are usually not found in archaeological excavations, although a copper sheath found next to chunkey stones at Cahokias Mound 72 may be an exception.&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press" /&gt;
*''pillbox hat'' – A cylindral shaped hat composed of unknown materials, only seen on chunkey players.
*''heart/bellows shaped apron'' – Archaeologists theorize that this may be the graphic representation of a human scalp attached to the belt of the figure. This motif seems to echo the beaded forelock, hair style (head shaved except for top-knot) and other attachments (shell, stone and copper ornaments) usually worn by mythological figures on their heads.&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press" /&gt;
*''Mangum Flounce'' – An oddly shaped motif consisting of looping lines hanging above and below the belt of the chunkey player. Named for a [[Mississippian copper plate]] found at the [[Mangum Mound Site]] in [[Claiborne County, Mississippi]] which includes the motif.

Although the figure described as the falcon dancer/warrior/chunkey player is not always shown in the act of playing chunkey, the placing of many of the motifs helps identify them as the same figure. Some motifs usually associated with the figure, such as the scalp, severed heads, broken chunkey sticks, and the ethnohistoric record associating it with gambling, seem to indicate the seriousness of the game. The price of defeat in the mythological record may have been the forfeiture of one's life and head.&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press" /&gt;

==Post-European contact==
[[File:Catlin Tchung-kee, a Mandan Game Played with a Ring and Pole 01.jpg|thumb|300px|left|"Tchung-kee, a Mandan Game Played with a Ring and Pole" by artist [[George Catlin]]]]
Many Native Americans continued playing the chunkey game long after European contact, including the [[Creek (people)|Creeks]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Chumash people|Chumash]],&lt;ref name="sierracanyon.pvt.k12.ca.us"/&gt; [[Choctaw]], and the [[Mandan]]s, as witnessed by the artist [[George Catlin]] in 1832,
{{cquote|''The game of Tchung-kee [is] a beautiful athletic exercise, which the Mandan seem to be almost unceasingly practicing whilst the weather is fair, and they have nothing else of moment to demand their attention. This game is decidedly their favourite amusement, and is played near to the village on a pavement of clay, which has been used for that purpose until it has become as smooth and hard as a floor. ... The play commences with two (one from each party), who start off upon a trot, abreast of each other, and one of them rolls in advance of them, on the pavement, a little ring of two or three inches in diameter, cut out of a stone; and each one follows it up with his 'tchung-kee' (a stick of six feet in length, with little bits of leather projecting from its sides of an inch or more in length), which he throws before him as he runs, sliding it along upon the ground after the ring, endeavouring to place it in such a position when it stops, that the ring may fall upon it, and receive one of the little projections of leather through it.''|20px|20px|''George Catlin, 1832''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=George Catlin|last=Catlin|first=George |title=Letters and Notes, vol. 1, no. 19|origyear=1841|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the early colonial era, it was still the most popular game among American Indians of the Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Charles M. Hudson (author)|first=Charles M.|last=Hudson |title=The Southeastern Indans|year=1976 |page=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creek chunkey yards were a large carefully cleared and leveled area, surrounded by embankments on either side, with a pole in the center, and possibly two more at either end. The poles were used for playing another indigenous game, the [[History of lacrosse|ball game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Charles M. Hudson (author)|first=Charles M.|last=Hudson |title=The Southeastern Indans|year=1976 |pages=220–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stones, valuable objects in themselves, were owned by the town or clans, not by individuals, and would be carefully preserved.
* [[Cherokee]]s scored their game in terms of how close the stone was to certain marks on the chunkey stick.
* [[Chickasaw]]s scored their game with a point for the person nearest the disc, two if it was touching the disc.
* [[Choctaw]]s played their game on a yard {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|100|ft|m}} in length. Poles were made of [[hickory]] wood, with four notches on the front end, one in the middle, and two at the other end. The score depended on which set of notches was closest to the disc. The game ended when a player had reached twelve points.

{{2014 Winter Olympics}}
There were many '''controversies and concerns affecting the 2014 Winter Olympics'''. There were disputes with [[Circassians]], who demanded the events be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for the 19th century [[Circassian genocide]],&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/21/russia-olympics-protest-idUSLDE62K02S20100321 Russian Olympics clouded by 19th century deaths]. [[Reuters]]. 21 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; environmental and economic issues, lack of political stability and governance, and the safety and [[LGBT rights in Russia|human rights of LGBT]] athletes and journalists, in light of Russia's "gay propaganda" laws, which sparked [[Olympic protests of Russian anti-gay laws|Olympic-focused protests]].&lt;ref name="variety-gaychallenge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-crackdown"/&gt; However, all of these events were overshadowed by the massive [[Doping in Russia|Russian state-sponsored doping program]] uncovered in the aftermath of the Games.

==Human rights==

{{see also|Politics and sports#Olympics|Human rights in Russia}}
On 30 January 2014, nine [[Amnesty International]] European directors delivered a petition in Moscow to the offices of Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] calling on him to repeal a series of laws restricting the right to [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of association]] in the run up to the 2014 Winter Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/amnesty-international-directors-deliver-global-petition-russian-president-a Amnesty International directors to deliver global petition to Russian President ahead of Sochi Olympics] [[Amnesty International]] 27 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The organization felt that the laws were no substitute for an effective justice system, and demanded the Russian authorities to release immediately and unconditionally all prisoners of conscience (POCs). The Russian parliament passed an amnesty bill that freed the imprisoned [[Pussy Riot]] singers, the foreign activists amongst [[Greenpeace]]'s "[[Arctic 30]]" and the [[Bolotnaya Square case|2012 Bolotnaya Square protest]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/russia-amnesty-law-no-substitute-effective-justice-system-2013-12-18 Russia: Amnesty Law no substitute for effective justice system] 27 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] has repeatedly presented the [[IOC]] detailed evidence of documented human rights abuses linked to Russia's preparations for the 2014 Winter Games since 2009. Human Rights Watch have documented exploitation of migrant workers in violation of Russian law; evictions of residents without fair compensation and in some cases, with no compensation at all. Many resettled residents lost a portion of their livelihoods; Threats, harassment, and lawsuits of activists and journalists critical of the Games, as well as Russia's discriminatory anti-LGBT propaganda law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/01/29/international-olympic-committee-skating-thin-ice-sochi  The International Olympic Committee Skating on Thin Ice in Sochi] [[Human Rights Watch]] January 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Not before late 2013 the Russian government and IOC covered $8.34 million in wage arrears.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/russia0213_ForUpload.pdf Race to the Bottom Exploitation of Migrant Workers Ahead of Russia's 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi] [[Human Rights Watch]] February 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/russias-olympian-abuses |title=Russia's Olympian Abuses |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both German president [[Joachim Gauck]] and [[European Commission]]er for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship [[Viviane Reding]] publicly boycotted the Games over human rights abuses, with Reding specifically citing Russia's treatment of minorities.&lt;ref name="reutera-2014boycott"/&gt;

On 21 January 2014 Russian authorities sentenced left activist [[Vladislav Ryazantsev]] to 15 days. Ryazantsev is one of the leaders of the Left Front movement. He has been arrested allegedly for swearing at a bus stop  late one evening.
Vladislav Ryazantsev and his fellow activists had planned to hold an action under the slogan of boycott of Sochi Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/27055/|title= Two detained opposition members go on hunger strike in Rostov-on-Don|work=Caucasian Knot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 February 2014 Russian authorities sentenced environmental activist Igor Kharchenko to five days. Kharchenko is member of the Russian [[NGO]] [[Environmental Watch for North Caucasus]] (Ecologicheskaya Vakhta po Severnomu Kavkazu). He has been arrested and his car was vandalized. Sergei Nikitin, Amnesty International's Moscow Office Director said: "The Russian authorities must halt their harassment of civil society activists, protect the right to peaceful [[freedom of expression]], and release the [[Sochi prisoners of conscience]]: Igor Kharchenko and his fellow [[environmentalist]] Yevgeny Vitishko, who is currently serving 15 days in administrative detention on trumped-up charges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sochi-olympics-countdown-sees-russia-jailing-second-prisoner-conscience-week-2014-02-05|title=Sochi Olympics countdown sees Russia jailing second prisoner of conscience this week|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evgeny Vitishko was arrested for 15 days in the Sochi area reportedly charged allegedly for swearing at a bus stop. Yevgeniy Vitishko and his fellow activists have been actively involved in protests regarding the [[Deforestation in Russia|deforestation]] and illegal construction and fencing in areas of protected forest around Sochi. AI is concerned about his unfair trial resulted in a court decision to send him to prison colony for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/russia-civil-society-activist-arrested-ahead-start-sochi-olympics-2014-02-0|title=RUSSIA: Civil society activist arrested ahead of start of Sochi Olympics|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police arrests===
Two members of the punk group [[Pussy Riot]], [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]] and  [[Maria Alekhina]], and a group of activists and journalists were arrested by Russian police in Sochi when simply walking down the street.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/18/pussy-riot-members-arrested-sochi-winter-olympics Pussy Riot members arrested in Sochi] the Guardian 18 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Pussy Riot members have urged politicians attending the Winter Olympics to criticise human rights abuses in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/31/pussy-riot-winter-olympics-human-rights Pussy Riot members urge politicians at Winter Olympics to speak out ] the Guardian 31 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amnesty International people are being targeted for peacefully speaking their minds. Almost daily there are reports of arrests of activists in Sochi and the Olympic Games area including Semyon Simonov [[Memorial]], David Hakim and journalists from [[Radio Free Europe]] and [[Novaya Gazeta]]. Amnesty demanded the International Olympic Committee to condemn the arrests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/russia-nine-new-arrests-near-sochi-olympics-include-pussy-riot-activists-2014-02-18 Russia: Nine new arrests near Sochi Olympics include Pussy Riot activists] Amnesty International 18 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT rights===
The [[LGBT rights in Russia|rights of LGBT people in Russia]] were a concern leading up to the Games (where seven openly [[lesbian]] and [[bisexual]], athletes, all female, were scheduled to participate).&lt;ref name="outsports-lgbtsochi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsports.com/2014/2/5/5382406/gay-winter-olympians-lesbian-bisexual-lgbt-athletes |title=7 out LGBT Winter Olympians in Sochi |work=Outsports |date= |accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia became the subject of international criticism following the signing of a [[Russian gay propaganda law|federal law]] by [[Vladimir Putin]] in June 2013, which banned the distribution of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" among minors. Mass media classified the legislation as being "anti-gay", while [[LGBT rights activist]]s considered the law to be too broad and vague, characterizing it as an effective ban on promoting [[LGBT rights]] and [[LGBT culture|culture]]. [[Human Rights Campaign]] (HRC) president [[Chad Griffin]] argued that even kissing a same-sex partner or displaying [[LGBT symbols]] such as the [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow flag]] could be illegal under the law.&lt;ref name="variety-gaychallenge"&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ted|title=Russia's Anti-Gay Laws Present Challenge for NBC's Olympics Coverage|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/russia-7-1200567694/|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-crackdown"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fierstein|first=Harvey|title=Russia's Anti-Gay Crackdown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/opinion/russias-anti-gay-crackdown.html?_r=0|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gce-facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Facts on LGBT Rights in Russia|url=http://www.globalequality.org/newsroom/latest-news/1-in-the-news/186-the-facts-on-lgbt-rights-in-russia%20The%20Facts%20on%20LGBT%20Rights%20in%20Russia|publisher=[[Council for Global Equality]]|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-nohaven"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gays in Russia Find No Haven, Despite Support From the West|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/world/europe/gays-in-russia-find-no-haven-despite-support-from-the-west.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=10 February 2014|first=David M.|last=Herszenhorn|date=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was also attributed to an increase in [[violence against LGBT people|homophobic violence]] in Russia by [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] and [[Neo-Nazi]] groups.&lt;ref name="pinknews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/08/06/gay-teenager-kidnapped-and-tortured-by-russian-homophobes-believed-to-have-died-from-injuries/|title=Gay teenager kidnapped and tortured by Russian homophobes claimed to have died from injuries|work=[[Pink News]]|date=6 August 2013|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greene, Andy |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/elton-john-blasts-russia-vicious-homophobia-has-been-legitimized-20140122 |title=Elton John Blasts Russia: 'Vicious Homophobia Has Been Legitimized' |publisher=Rollingstone.com |date=2014-01-22 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-violenthomophobia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian anti-gay law prompts rise in homophobic violence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/russia-rise-homophobic-violence|work=The Guardian|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also considered the law to be inconsistent with principle six of the [[Olympic Charter]], which states that "any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the [[Olympic Movement]]."&lt;ref name="time-threebigissues"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gregory|first=Sean|title=Three Big Issues Facing the Next Olympic Committee President|url=http://keepingscore.blogs.time.com/2013/09/10/three-big-issues-facing-the-next-olympic-committee-president/|work=Time|accessdate=10 February 2014|date=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "&lt;ref name="nyt-crackdown"/&gt;

====Assurances====
In August 2013, the IOC stated that it had "received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/winter-olympics/10233350/Sochi-Winter-Olympics-2014-International-Olympic-Committee-receives-assurances-on-anti-gay-laws.html|title=Sochi Winter Olympics 2014: International Olympic Committee receives assurances on anti-gay laws|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=9 August 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was contradicted in a statement three days later made by [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Russia's Ministry of the Interior]], which stated that the anti-propaganda laws would still be enforced in Sochi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/08/13/russias-anti-gay-crackdown-raises-concerns-for-olympic-visitors/|title=Russia's anti-gay crackdown raises concerns for Olympics|publisher=MSNBC|first=Emma|last=Margolin|date=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC also confirmed that it would enforce Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter, which forbids political protest, against athletes who make displays of support for the LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/olympic-committee-threatens-punish-athletes-who-fight-gay-russians120813|first=Treis|last=Reid-Smith|title=Olympic Committee threatens to punish athletes who fight for gay Russians|date=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC received written assurance from the Russian government in August 2013 stating that it was committed to abiding by the Olympic Charter during the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-statement/207922 |title=IOC Statement |publisher=Olympic.org |date=2013-08-22 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vladimir Putin also made similar assurances prior to the Games, but warned LGBT attendees to abide by the law.&lt;ref name="aljazerra-putinspeech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/01/putin-says-gays-should-feel-welcome-at-sochi-2014117134055886466.html|title=Putin says gays should feel welcome at Sochi |publisher=Al Jazeera English|date=|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anatoly Pakhomov]], mayor of Sochi, explained to reporters prior to the Games that homosexuality "was not the custom in the [[Caucasus]]", and claimed that no gays lived in Sochi at all (despite the presence of two [[gay club]]s and evidence of a LGBT community in Sochi on a Russian social network). He went on to say that everyone, including gays, were welcome in Sochi, "as long as they do not impose their habits on others."&lt;ref name=rtsm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/politics/sochi-gays-mayor-claim-240/ |title=Sochi mayor says there are 'no gay people' living in the city |publisher=RT |date=2014-01-27 |accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protests and campaigns====
Despite these assurances, [[Olympic protests of Russian anti-gay laws|Olympic-focused protests and campaigns]], such as the [[Principle 6 campaign]] (a collaboration between a group of Olympic athletes, the organizations All Out, [[Athlete Ally]], and clothing maker [[American Apparel]]), have been held in protest of Russia's anti-gay policies. There were also calls to [[boycott]] the Games, drawing comparisons to [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|the Summer Olympics of 1980]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name="variety-gaychallenge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reutera-2014boycott"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/olympics-eu-commissioner-joins-german-president-sochi-snub-131149890--spt.html |title=Olympics-EU Commissioner joins German president in Sochi snub |publisher=[[Yahoo!

At January, 2014 Russian leader of the Left Front movement Vladislav Ryazantsev together with like-minded persons opened out an informative campaign against Olympic Games in Sochi. In the social network of VK.com appeared the group «Boycott of Olympic Games-2014 in Sochi»&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vk.com/boycott_sochi|title=Boycott of Olympic Games-2014 in Sochi|work=VK.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Ryazantsev united with left activist Anton Morvan publishes devastating information about the cost of Olympic Games and scales saw cut at its preparation. In addition, the group collects information about the game shooting of animals in the city-resort. — The Group «Boycott of Olympic Games-2014 in Sochi» is one of many private initiatives of left activists. Its purpose is collection and publication of true information about violations, crimes and peculations during the preparation of the Olympic Games, helping to open eyes people», — Vladislav Ryazantsev reported to the journalist of Donnews.ru. — «In addition, we call to declare boycott, avoid watching the games and buying commodities with symbolism of Olympic Games».&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://donnews.ru/Aktivist-Levogo-fronta-iz-Rostova-prizyvaet-rossiyan-boykotirovat-Olimpiadu-v-Sochi_13779|title=The activist of "Left front" from Rostov calls Russians to boycott Olympiad in Sochi|work= Donnews.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of world leaders, including United States president [[Barack Obama]] and Vice President [[Joe Biden]], Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], and French President [[François Hollande]], declined to attend the Games' Opening Ceremony as delegates for various reasons. Although attending the Winter Olympics has not historically been a priority for world leaders, there was still speculation that their non-attendance was a symbolic boycott of Russian policies.&lt;ref name="guardian-whosgoing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sochi Winter Olympics: who is going to the opening ceremony?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/05/western-leaders-boycott-sochi-winter-olympics|work=The Guardian|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-19/putin-plays-games-to-salvage-olympics.html|title=Putin Plays Games to Salvage Olympics|publisher=Bloomberg.com|date=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.salon.com/2013/12/17/president_obama_joins_list_of_world_leaders_to_snub_sochi_olympics/ President Obama joins list of world leaders to snub Sochi Olympics]".

Although Obama stressed diversity and made no reference to the controversy when announcing the delegation, on 6 February 2014, he confirmed the intent of the choices during an interview with [[Bob Costas]] aired by [[Olympics on NBC|NBC]] the next day, stating that "there is no doubt we wanted to make it very clear that we do not abide by discrimination in anything, including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."&lt;ref name="thr-obamanbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympics: Obama, Bob Costas Chat About 'Tough Guy' Putin During Interview (Video)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/olympics-obama-bob-costas-chat-678042|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=10 February 2014|first=Philiana|last=Ng}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cahow stated that the decision was meant to "[highlight] Americans who know what it means to have freedoms and liberties under the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]].

In February 2014, prior to the games, a group of 40 human rights organizations (including [[Athlete Ally]], [[Freedom House]], [[Human Rights Campaign]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Russian LGBT network]] among others) sent a joint letter to the ten Worldwide Olympic Partner companies, urging them to use their prominence to support the rights of LGBT athletes under the Olympic Charter, and pressure the IOC to show greater scrutiny towards the [[human rights abuses]] of future host countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/sochi-2014-olympics-unsafe-lgbt-community-under-russias-anti-gay-law-activists-warn-1334223 |title=Sochi 2014 Olympics Unsafe For LGBT Community Under Russia's Anti-Gay Law, Activists Warn |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bostoncom-hrc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Human rights groups urge Olympic corporate sponsors to speak out against Russia's policies|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/blogs/bostonspirit/2014/02/human_rights_groups_urge_olymp.html|work=Boston.com|accessdate=9 February 2014|first=David|last=Zimmerman|date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 2014, [[United States Olympic Committee|USOC]] sponsor [[AT&amp;T]] issued a statement in support of LGBT rights at the Games, becoming the first major Olympic advertiser to condemn the laws.&lt;ref name="nyt-atandtlgbt"&gt;{{cite news|title=AT&amp;T Becomes First Major Advertiser to Protest Russia's Antigay Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/business/media/att-becomes-first-major-advertiser-to-protest-russias-antigay-law.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 February 2014|first=Stuart|last=Elliott|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several major non-sponsors also made pro-LGBT statements to coincide with the opening of the Games; [[Google]] placed a quotation from the Olympic Charter and an Olympic-themed [[Google Doodle|logo]] in the colors of the rainbow flag on its [[Google Search|home page]] worldwide,&lt;ref name="lat-googleolympics"&gt;{{cite news|last=Guynn|first=Jessica|title=Google takes stand against anti-gay law at Sochi Winter Olympics|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-google-takes-stand-against-antigay-law-at-sochi-winter-olympics-20140206,0,5844351.story#axzz2sq5aNKn4|accessdate=9 February 2014|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Channel 4]] (who serves as the official British broadcaster of the [[2014 Winter Paralympics|Paralympics]]) adopted a rainbow-colored logo and broadcast a "celebratory", pro-LGBT advert entitled "[[Gay Mountain]]" on 7 February 2014, alongside an interview with former [[rugby union]] player and anti-homophobia activist [[Ben Cohen (rugby union)|Ben Cohen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Claire|first=Hodgson|title=Sochi 2014: Channel 4 logo goes rainbow to show support for gay community ahead of Winter Olympics|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/sochi-2014-channel-4-logo-3119289|accessdate=9 February 2014|newspaper=The Mirror|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C4 goes rainbow to wish "good luck to those out in Sochi"|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/channel-4-goes-rainbow-to-wish-good-luck-in-sochi|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Huffington Post]]'' noted that the opening ceremony, ironically, featured tributes to "some of history's most widely acclaimed and definitely gay Russians", including composer [[Peter Tchaikovsky]] (1840-1893), ballet dancer [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] (1889-1950), and patron of arts, and founder of [[Ballets Russes]], [[Sergei Diaghilev]].

== Doping scandal ==
{{Main|Doping in Russia|McLaren Report|Russia at the 2014 Winter Olympics}}
In December 2014, German public broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] aired a documentary which made wide-ranging allegations that Russia organized a state-run [[Doping in Russia|doping program]] which supplied their athletes with [[performance-enhancing drugs]].&lt;ref name=Guard3Dec&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olterman|first1=Philip|title=Russia accused of athletics doping cover-up on German TV|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/03/russia-accused-athletics-doping-cover-up-olympics|accessdate=9 November 2015|work=Guardian|date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2015, Russia's [[track and field]] team was provisionally suspended by the [[IAAF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Athletics doping: Russia provisionally suspended by IAAF|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/34811896|website = BBC Sport|accessdate = 14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published allegations by the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games.&lt;ref name=NYT160512/&gt; Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a [[cover-up]], and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won at Sochi were the result of doping.&lt;ref name=NYT160512&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/sports/russia-doping-sochi-olympics-2014.html |title= Russian Insider Says State-Run Doping Fueled Olympic Gold |first= Rebecca R. |last= Ruiz |first2= Michael |last2= Schwirtz |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= 12 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mystery in Sochi Doping Case Lies With Tamper-Proof Bottle  |first1=Rebecca R. |last1=Ruiz |first2=Michael |last2=Schwirtz |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 May 2016 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/sports/russia-doping-sochi-olympics-2014.html?_r=0 |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GN150601&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/01/wada-world-anti-doping-russia-olympics-games-sochi-david-howman |title= New doping report will influence decision on Russia’s place at Olympics |first= Owen |last= Gibson |work= The Guardian |date= 1 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-upheld"&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian athletics: IAAF upholds ban before Rio Olympics|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/17/russia-rio-olympics-ban-doping-iaaf-sebastian-coe|website=The Guardian|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, following the release of the McLaren report on Russian doping at the Sochi Olympics, the [[International Olympic Committee]] announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes at the Sochi Olympic Games.

Three ladies artistic skaters were named as being under investigation. They are [[Adelina Sotnikova]], the singles gold medalist, as well as pairs skaters [[Tatiana Volosozhar]] and [[Ksenia Stolbova]]. Volosozhar and Stolbova won gold and silver medals, respectively, in pairs skating. Both also won gold medals in the team event, which also puts the other eight team medalists at risk of losing their golds.

Six skiers were provisionally suspended from competition on the basis of the McLaren report: [[Evgeniy Belov]], [[Alexander Legkov]], [[Alexey Petukhov]], [[Maxim Vylegzhanin]], [[Julia Ivanova (cross-country skier)|Yulia Ivanova]] and [[Evgenia Shapovalova]]. Legkov won a gold medal, and Vylegzhanin won three silver medals.

The [[International Biathlon Union]] provisionally suspended two biathletes who were in the Sochi games: [[Olga Vilukhina]] and [[Yana Romanova]], according to ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]''. Vilukhina won silver in sprint, and both women were on a relay team that won the silver medal. They both retired after the 2014/2015 season.

The [[International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation]] provisionally suspended four skeleton sliders. They are among the six athletes on the skeleton team: [[Nikita Tregubov]], [[Aleksandr Tretyakov (skeleton racer)|Alexander Tretyakov]], [[Sergey Chudinov]], [[Elena Nikitina]], [[Maria Orlova]] and [[Olga Potylitsina]]. Tretyakov won a gold medal, and Nikitina won a silver.

It has been speculated that some Russia’s Winter Olympians used [[xenon]] gas in preparation for the Sochi Games. Using xenon gas is not specifically banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA); however, it could be used for performance enhancement and raises questions about what constitutes doping and practices that should and shouldn’t be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Xenon gas as a performance-enhancing drug: doping or just hot air? |url=https://cyclingtips.com/2014/03/xenon-gas-as-a-performance-enhancing-drug-doping-or-just-hot-air/|work=Cyclingtips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament|men's ice hockey tournament]] round-robin game between [[United States men's national ice hockey team|USA]] and [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]], an apparent Russian goal scored late in the third period, which would have given the team a 3-2 lead, was disallowed after referees ruled that the net was moved when the goal was scored. The decision resulted in the score remaining 2-2. USA went on to win the game in a shootout, which resulted in Russia playing a playoff qualification game while USA received a bye to the quarterfinals. The decision was criticized by some Russian commentators, who also expressed concern about the fact that one of the officials on the ice was American. Following the game, protesters led by the Kremlin party's youth group held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in [[Moscow]] to protest the decision. In response to the controversy, Konstantin Komissarov, the referee supervisor of [[International Ice Hockey Federation]], officially confirmed that the decision by the referee was correct, citing the appropriate use of video review in assessing the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2014/icehockey/story/_/id/10471083/russian-hockey-fans-protest-disallowed-goal-united-states |title=Russian hockey fans protest disallowed goal in favor of the United States |author=ESPN |date=21 February 2014 |website=espn.go.com/ |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athlete selection controversies==
Several controversial choices of the athletes going to the Olympics to represent countries have occurred.

The participation of Lebanese alpine skier [[Jackie Chamoun]] became controversial in [[Lebanon]] after it was revealed at home in 2014 that she had posed in sexy photos for an Austrian calendar in 2011. A ministerial investigation has been mooted, while an online support protest "Strip for Jackie" has been organized. Chamoun has denied that she posed nude publicly on her Facebook page, saying that the behind the scenes images were not for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.sportetstyle.fr/girls/galeries/a,780,jackie-chamoun-au-royaume-des-skieuses-topless.html |language= French |date= 12 February 2014 |author= Isabelle Vatan |publisher= L'Equipe Sport&amp;Style |title= Jackie Chamoun au royaume des skieuses topless  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.courrierinternational.com/article/2014/02/12/jackie-oh |publisher= Le Monde Courrier International |title= Jackie, oh! |author= Ziyad Makhoul |date= 12 February 2014 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/sports/archives/2014/02/20140215-081323.html |title= Naked fans support topless Lebanese skier Jackie Chamoun |date= 15 February 2014 |author= QMI |publisher= Sun News |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140224135113/http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/sports/archives/2014/02/20140215-081323.html |archivedate= 24 February 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/news/mariachi-topless-lebanese-muse-olympic-slalom-035955693--oly.html?pt=BureoF2GVB/ |title= Mariachi, topless Lebanese muse take to Olympic slalom |date= 20 February 2014 |author= Luke Phillips |work= AFP |publisher= Yahoo Sports }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Korea]], a furore has erupted over the loss of [[Viktor Ahn]] (Ahn Hyun-Soo) to Team Russia. Several newspapers reported the scorn of the Korean public and newspaper editors on the actions of the [[Korea Skating Union]]. The minister of sport and president of South Korea have both promised action in rooting out corruption and feuding at the organization that may have led to his "defection", in a bid to clean it up in preparation for the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in South Korea. The Korean public is generally supportive of Ahn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.scmp.com/sport/other-sport/article/1429786/fury-over-viktor-ahns-russian-gold-aimed-korean-skating-union |author= Agence France-Presse |publisher= South China Morning Post |date= 17 February 2014 |title= Fury over Viktor Ahn's 'Russian' gold aimed at Korean Skating Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/viktor-ahn-russia-2014-2 |title= Why A Korean Speed Skating Star Changed His Name And Started Racing For Russia |author= Tony Manfred |date= 16 February 2014 |publisher= Business Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/sports/olympics/ahn-rejected-us-to-skate-for-russia.html?_r=0 |title= Rejecting the U.S. to Skate for Russia |author= Sam Borden |date= 9 February 2014 |publisher= New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selection of [[Ashley Wagner]] over [[Mirai Nagasu]] by the United States Olympic Team for ladies' singles figure skating caused some controversy, as at the selection competition, Nagasu finished ahead of Wagner. Wagner was selected on the body of her work, instead of the strength of her selection performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sportsgrid.com/controversy-2/ashley-wagner-face-is-your-first-winter-olympics-meme/ |title= ‘Ashley Wagner Face’ Is Your First Winter Olympics Meme |author= Rick Chandler |date= 9 February 2014 |publisher= SportsGrid }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/olympics-fourth-place-medal/mirai-nagasu--olympic-snub-remains--devastating---but-hopeful-for-future-144149306.html |title= Mirai Nagasu: Olympic snub remains 'devastating,' but hopeful for future |author= Kevin Kaduk |date= 30 January 2014 |publisher= Yahoo Sports }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20775569,00.html |title= Ashley Wagner Speaks Out About Olympic Ice Skating Controversy |author= Johnny Dodd |publisher= People |date= 13 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unclear selection process, and the fact that the second-place finisher [[Polina Edmunds]] had no international experience lead to some calls of racism, as the selection of Wagner over Nagasu was due to international results, while Edmunds' was not. This was the first time that the USFSA (United States Figure Skating Association) selected a skater who had competed in the selection trials and lost over another on who had also competed, previous times had done this only for skaters who had been injured and unable to compete at trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usaukonline.com/latest-news/42293-controversy-as-figure-skater-who-fell-twice-at-olympic-qualifiers-and-came-fourth-is-chosen-for-games-ahead-of-woman-in-third.html |title= Controversy as figure skater who fell TWICE at Olympic qualifiers and came fourth is chosen for games ahead of woman in third |author= Mandy Oteng |date= 13 January 2014 |publisher= USA-UK Online |work= Daily Mail (London) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/01/14/mirai-nagasu-ashley-wagner-and-the-myth-of-the-golden-girl/ |title= Mirai Nagasu, Ashley Wagner and the Myth of the Golden Girl |author= Tao Jones |date= 14 January 2014 |publisher= Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of ''legioneri'' by the Russian Olympic Team has caused both joy and controversy inside Russia. The foreign origin naturalized Russian Olympians have sparked some questioning about the state of native Russian athletes. While in other quarters, the fact that Russia is now attracting Olympic level competitors instead of only losing them to other countries is a sign of progress. Many of the adopted sportspeople have been warmly embraced by Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mid-day.com/articles/russias-success-in-sochi-olympics-is-imported/15101068 |title= Russia's success in Sochi Olympics is imported |author= AFP |publisher= MidDay |date= 18 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/russia-s-foreign-legion/1000448.html |title= Russia's 'foreign legion' finally marches to medals |date= 17 February 2014 |author= AFP |publisher= Channel NewsAsia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the games in July, four Slovenian officials were suspended for four years from [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] after they helped to falsify times and rankings to allow alpine skier Vanessa Vanakorn (best known as the British violinist [[Vanessa-Mae]] and represented for Thailand as her father is a Thai) to achieve an average of 140 points of fewer at an FIS event to enable her to qualify for Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/violinist-sochi-olympics-vanessa-mae-slovenia-ski|title=Violinist's pre-Sochi Olympic results rigged, claims Slovenia ski body|first=Associated|last=Press|date=11 July 2014|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] event in [[Krvavec]], where she achieved her required score, she finished 6th (and last)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.fis-ski.com/dynamic/results.html?sector=AL&amp;competitorid=168683&amp;raceid=78548|title=National Junior Championships - Ladies' Giant Slalom  19.01.2014|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the national junior championships, despite being over 14 years older to the next eldest contestant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/winter-olympics/25802907|title=Violinist Vanessa Mae set to compete at Winter Olympics|first=Ollie Williams BBC Olympic sports|last=reporter|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also finished 7th (but last),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.fis-ski.com/dynamic/results.html?sector=AL&amp;competitorid=168683&amp;raceid=78549 |title=FIS Race - Ladies' Giant Slalom  19.01.2014 |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820202640/http://data.fis-ski.com/dynamic/results.html?sector=AL&amp;competitorid=168683&amp;raceid=78549 |archivedate=20 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 9th (of 13th)&lt;ref name="data.fis-ski.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.fis-ski.com/dynamic/results.html?sector=AL&amp;competitorid=168683&amp;raceid=78547|title=FIS Race - Ladies' Giant Slalom  17.01.2014|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 10th (of 13th).&lt;ref name="data.fis-ski.com"/&gt; She finished with a total time of 3:26.97, 50.10 seconds behind the winner, [[Tina Maze]] of [[Slovenia]].

Gazeta.ru, 5 July 2007 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the construction of Olympic venues in the buffer area of the [[UNESCO]] protected [[Caucasus]] Biosphere Reserve and [[Sochi National Park]] could be harmful, the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] approved the plans. [[Greenpeace]] of Russia said that the IOC and the [[Government of Russia|Russian Government]] assumed all responsibility for any damage to the [[West Caucasus]] natural [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. According to the [[Sochi bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi bid]], a wide array of construction was planned in the [[Grushevyi Ridge]] area. They included a cascade of [[hydroelectric]] [[power station]]s on the [[Mzymta River]], [[sewage treatment]] facilities, a high-speed rail link, a Mountain Olympic Village, a track for bobsleigh, luge and skeleton (which was relocated in May 2009), and a biathlon venue. Alpine skiing venues were being constructed in the [[Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort|Rosa Khutor]] plateau and the [[Psekhako Ridge]] area. Environmentalists proposed building up [[Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi, Krasnodar Krai|Krasnaya Polyana]] instead of destroying [[nature reserve]] sites.

Environmentalists also opposed the plan of construction of a [[container terminal|cargo terminal]] for ships in the mouth of the [[Psou River]] in the [[Imereti Lowland]], because this could lead to the destruction of the largest areas of sea-flooded shore and marshes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kavkaz-uzel.ru/newstext/news/id/1192223.html Environmentalists: Kuban authorities prepare to sacrifice one more nature site for the Olympics].

On 3 July 2008, [[Vladimir Putin]] directed some of the Olympic venues, such as the luge and bobsleigh track, to be relocated (the [[Russian National Sliding Centre]] was relocated in May 2009). He said "In setting our priorities and choosing between money and the environment, we're choosing the environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/03/AR2008070301912.html|work=The Washington Post|first=Peter|last=Finn|title=Putin Directs Organizers of 2014 Winter Olympics to Protect Wilderness|date=3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/600/42/368730.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804183735/http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/600/42/368730.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 August 2008|title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090115165241/http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=12836886&amp;PageNum=0 Putin blasts Olympics organizers for imperfect building projects] – [[ITAR-TASS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geologist Sergei Volkov fled to Ukraine after speaking out about environmental and geological problems. He stated that [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[uranium]] deposits, as well as the probability of [[landslides]], made the location of the games hazardous.

They were two of eight whales captured off the coast of Russia.&lt;ref name="Where in the World is Narnia, the Sochi Olympics Orca?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/where_in_the_world_is_narnia_the_sochi_olympics_orca|title=Where in the World is Narnia, the Sochi Olympics Orca?|publisher=Earth Island.org|date=February 4, 2014|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After backlash by various advocacy groups and petitions signed by the general public, a statement was released that the whales would not be part of the Olympics.&lt;ref name="Sochi Olympics Set to Feature Killer Whales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/animals/whales-dolphins/sochi-olympics-set-to-feature-killer-whales-140123.htm|title=Sochi Olympics Set to Feature Killer Whales|publisher=Discovery.com|date=6 February 2014|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current whereabouts of the whales are unknown.

It was rumored that the committee had planned to have a dolphin trained to carry the Olympic torch. Activists spoke up about the issue immediately, causing the President of the Olympics Committee, Dmitry Chernyshenko, to issue the statement that, "I confirm that we do not involve any orcas or dolphins for the Olympics."&lt;ref name="Protests Trigger a Rethink in Sochi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceancare.org/en/news/?75/ProteststriggerarethinkinSochi|title=Protests Trigger a Rethink in Sochi|publisher=Ocean Care.org|date=6 February 2014|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not there had been any plans for a dolphin torchbearer has never been confirmed.

==Economy==
According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' the $50 billion or so lavished on Sochi is becoming a political liability. The stalling of the economy, despite the stimulus of Olympic spending, has raised worries about popular unrest directed at the Kremlin and a tightening of political freedoms in response once the Games are over. "It is about what Russia could have done with this money." said Aleksei A. Navalny, the Foundation for the Fight Against Corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/world/europe/russias-economic-malaise-casts-specter-over-games.html A Triumph for Putin, if Not for the Rest of a Sagging Russia] New York Times, 5 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

According to IRN.Ru analytical agency, prices for land, located next to the shoreline, reach $150,000 per 100 m²,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100122105854/http://www.strana.ru/doc.html?id=69493 Struggle with «olympic» swindlers in Sochi]. Strana.Ru, 19 July 2007 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; while price per square metre in average panel [[apartment building]] on the outskirts of the city already reaches $2000. "As a result of 2014 Olympics euphoria prices will rise annually by 15–20%," speculates Irina Tyurina, press secretary of Russian Tourist Industry Union. This could lead to decrease in tourist interest to Sochi, which already has fallen below [[Anapa]], [[Gelendzhik]] and Adler.&lt;ref name="not_a_place"&gt;[http://sport.gazeta.ru/sport/2007/07/a_1880984.shtml Sochi is not a place for recreation]. Gazeta.ru, 5 July 2007 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the IOC Evaluation Commission visited Sochi in February 2007, local authorities promised to buy the lands from [[Lower Imereti Bay]] long-time residents for a fair market price. But during the following half a year, no local resident could get their land approved as private property.&lt;ref name="world_heritage"/&gt;

While most Olympic Games have high cost overruns, for these Games they are much higher than usual. Much of the cost overruns have been blamed on corruption, with [[Boris Nemtsov]] claiming: "The Sochi Olympics are an unprecedented thieves' caper in which representatives of Putin's government are mixed up along with the oligarchs close to the government." &lt;ref name="economist-sand"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21581764-most-expensive-olympic-games-history-offer-rich-pickings-select-few-castles|title=The Sochi Olympics: Castles in the sand|publisher=The Economist|date=July 13, 2013|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research by [[Transparency International]], a global anti-corruption watchdog, approximately 50 percent or more of the building costs went to corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/olympics--one-year-out--sochi-s-winter-olympic-celebration-is-already-dogged-by-allegations-of-massive-corruption-162804429.html|title=One year out, Sochi's Winter Olympics is already dogged by allegations of massive corruption|publisher=Yahoo Sports|date=Feb 7, 2013|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor workers conditions and rights have also been raised as an issue of concern, with at least 25 people dying and many more injured in accidents on sites in 2012 and with workers not getting paid at all.&lt;ref name="economist-sand" /&gt;

[[Circassians|Circassian]] organisations have also spoken out against the Olympics, arguing that the Games will take place on land that had been inhabited by them since the beginning of recorded history by their ancestors until 1864,&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha, Amjad.

Retrieved on 2 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The games are viewed to be particularly offensive because they include the date of the 150th anniversary of what they consider a genocide. It has thus been a rallying cry for [[Circassian nationalism|Circassian nationalists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circassianworld.com/new/general/1382-circassian-dimension-2014sochi-szhemukh.html|title=The Circassian Dimension of the 2014 Sochi Olympics|last=Zhemukhov|first=Sufian|date=September 2009|work=PONARS Policy Memo No. 65 – Georgetown University|publisher=Circassian World|accessdate=28 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011120907/http://www.circassianworld.com/new/general/1382-circassian-dimension-2014sochi-szhemukh.html|archivedate=11 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS104971+22-May-2009+PRN20090522|title=145th Anniversary of the Circassian Genocide and the Sochi Olympics Issue|date=22 May 2009|agency=Reuters|accessdate=28 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702174523/https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/22/idUS104971%2B22-May-2009%2BPRN20090522|archivedate=2 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, there is much ire over the use of a hill called "Red Hill".&lt;ref name="NorthJersey-redhill"&gt;{{cite news|date=9 February 2010|author=Andrea Alexander|title=North Jersey Circassians 'in exile' launch Olympic protest|work="NorthJersey.com"}}"In 1864 a group of Circassians tried to return home but were defeated in a bloody battle on a mountain that became known as "Red Hill."

"That is where the ski lifts and ski events will be held, at the Red Hill," said Zack Barsik, president of the local Circassian Institute. "The Olympic events of skiing and snowboarding will be held on that same mountain."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, a group of Circassians apparently tried to return home but were attacked and a battle ensued, ending in their massacre, and attaining the name "Red Hill" (for the blood spilled). There were skiing and snowboarding events planned to be held on this hill.&lt;ref name="NorthJersey-redhill"/&gt;

==Political stability and governance==
The 2008 [[Russia–Georgia war]], which broke out at the start of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], surprised the Olympic community. "It is not what the world wants to see. It is contrary to what the Olympic ideal stands for", said an IOC spokesperson. However, in November 2008, the IOC turned down a request by the [[Georgian National Olympic Committee]] to reconsider its decision to hold the Olympics on the territory "adjacent both to the [Russian-]occupied Abkhaz conflict zone, and to the extremely unstable and volatile North Caucasus".

Related concerns persist, regarding the region's safety and the desirability of hosting an Olympics in a conflict-ridden zone. "The region is such a muddied and bloodied aquarium of conflict that to pick out any one fish is impossible," says [[Oleg Nechiporenko]], chief analyst for Russia's National Anti-Terrorist and Anti-Criminal Fund, in response to a 26 May 2010, car bombing, whose suspects include Russian nationalists, local [[Russian mafia]] groups, [[Separatism|separatists]] and [[Islamists]] in the North Caucasus, or a remnant of the war in [[Abkhazia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1992911,00.html|work=Time|first=Simon|last=Shuster|title=Is Sochi Safe Enough for the Olympics?|date=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/sochi-2014-the-terrorist-threat-8890?page=show|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819203315/http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/sochi-2014-the-terrorist-threat-8890?page=show|archivedate=2013-08-19 |title=Commentary: Sochi 2014: The Terrorist Threat |publisher=The National Interest |date=2013-08-15 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sochi borders Russia's six autonomous North Caucasus republics, home of the [[Second Chechen War]] which allegedly face social problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,680560,00.html|title=Opinion: Will Olympic Flame Dim in Sochi?|work=Der Spiegel|accessdate=23 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401212818/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0%2C1518%2C680560%2C00.html|archivedate=1 April 2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in Daily Telegraph, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, head of [[Saudi]] intelligence, allegedly confronted the Kremlin with a mix of inducements and threats in a bid to break the deadlock over Syria. This included security of winter olympics in Sochi if there is no accord. "I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us," he allegedly said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/10266957/Saudis-offer-Russia-secret-oil-deal-if-it-drops-Syria.html |title=Saudis offer Russia secret oil deal if it drops Syria |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date=2013-08-27 |location=London |first=Ambrose |last=Evans-Pritchard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian Envoy to the North Caucasus [[Alexander Khloponin]] told local law enforcement that "the violent scramble for assets" is likely to get worse as Russia invests heavily in tourist infrastructure and Olympic-caliber ski resorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1992911,00.html|title=Is Sochi Safe Enough for the Olympics?|date=30 May 2010|work=Time|first=Simon|last=Shuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2014 Russian Formula One Grand Prix==
In [[2014 Formula One season|2014]], Sochi hosted the [[Russian Grand Prix|Russian]] [[Formula One|Formula One Grand Prix]].

==Countries choosing not to enter competitors==
A total of 91 nations qualified to compete at the Games. However, three nations chose not to send their athletes to the Games, even though they had met the international qualification standards.

[[Puerto Rico]] is not sending [[Kristina Krone]] for the second consecutive time because the [[Puerto Rico Olympic Committee]] (COPUR) withdrew its recognition of the Puerto Rico Winter Sports Federation after the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] due to an eligibility controversy involving a member of their bobsled team. According to COPUR president [[Sara Rosario]], "Until there is a properly constituted winter sports federation with the requisite seriousness upon which we can consistently rely every four years, we cannot endorse (participation by Puerto Rico athletes in the Olympic Winter Games)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pagan Rivera |first=Esteban |date=12 January 2014 |title=Kristina Krone: Quería ir a Sochi, pero nunca recibió contestación del Comité Olímpico |url=http://www.primerahora.com/deportes/otros/nota/kristinakronequeriairasochiperonuncarecibiocontestaciondelcomiteolimpico-982330/ |language=Spanish |newspaper=Primerahora |location= |publisher= |accessdate=12 January 2014 |quote=Hasta que no haya un proyecto con la seriedad que requiere y una federación de deportes de invierno realmente constituida, a la cual podamos estar pendientes de ellos cada cuatro años de manera consistente, no podemos avalar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krone has represented [[Puerto Rico]] since 2008 in more than 100 alpine ski competitions sanctioned by the [[International Ski Federation]] including the 2009, 2011 and 2013 [[World Alpine Ski Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.fis-ski.com/dynamic/athlete-biography.html?sector=AL&amp;competitorid=149881&amp;type=result&amp;bt=prev&amp;limit=50&amp;bt=prev&amp;rec_start=0 |title=KRONE Kristina – Biographie |publisher=Data.fis-ski.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Africa]] would not enter skier [[Sive Speelman]], who, although invited to compete by the IOC, did not meet the standards set by  the [[South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=South Africa withdraws only athlete|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2014/alpine/story/_/id/10343352/south-africa-denies-only-olympian-sive-speelman-place-sochi |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |newspaper=Associated Press|date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Algeria]] also chose not to enter its only competitor, [[Mehdi-Selim Khelifi]], because he was the only one that managed to qualify, even though he was their only entry four years prior at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dubault |first=Fabrice |date=24 January 2014 |title=L'histoire invraisemblable de Mehdi Khelifi privé de J.O par l'Algérie |url=http://languedoc-roussillon.france3.fr/2014/01/24/l-histoire-invraisemblable-de-mehdi-khelifi-prive-de-jo-par-l-algerie-401707.html |newspaper=[[France 3]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate=24 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent participants==
There were three [[Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2014 Winter Olympics|Independent Olympic participants]] from [[India]] who competed under the Olympics flag. In December 2012, the [[Indian Olympic Association]] was suspended by the [[IOC]] due to government interference in the autonomy and election of leaders, thus not complying with the [[Olympic charter]]. Fresh elections were due to take place after the opening ceremony so Indian athletes were scheduled to participate as independents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Shiva Kesavan hopes India's suspension lifted before Sochi Olympics |url=http://olympics.cbc.ca/news/article/shiva-kesavan-hopes-india-suspension-lifted-before-sochi-olympics-30984.html |newspaper=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |location= |agency=Associated Press |date=18 December 2013 |accessdate=31 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129111156/http://olympics.cbc.ca/news/article/shiva-kesavan-hopes-india-suspension-lifted-before-sochi-olympics-30984.html |archivedate=29 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="d"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=10 January 2014 |title=Three Indians to take part in Sochi Winter Games |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tournaments/2014-sochi-winter-olympics/Three-Indians-to-take-part-in-Sochi-Winter-Games/articleshow/28596848.cms |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate=10 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course adjustments==
A crash in practice from Norwegian [[slopestyle]] snowboarder [[Torstein Horgmo]], who fractured his collarbone, and complaints from other athletes that some jumps were too steep have prompted organizers to modify the slopestyle course in the week before the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sochi Snowboarding Course Deemed Too Dangerous After Accident| url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sochi2014/Sochi-Snowboarding-Course-Deemed-Too-Dangerous-After-Accident.html |publisher= The Moscow Times| date=3 February 2014| accessdate=3 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later the women's downhill ski training was stopped after the opening three racers were getting too much air on the jump down the home stretch. The International Ski Federation had workers adjusting the course making it smoother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Fenninger tops in Olympic downhill training run| url=http://www.kansas.com/2014/02/06/3270531/womens-training-run-delayed-after.html#storylink=cpy| archive-url=https://archive.is/20140206154818/http://www.kansas.com/2014/02/06/3270531/womens-training-run-delayed-after.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=6 February 2014|publisher= kansas.com| date=6 February 2014| accessdate=6 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inadequate preparation of visitor facilities==
In the week prior to the start of the Games, reports began coming out of Sochi that a number of the accommodations for visitors and journalists were still incomplete. Several hotels meant to house visitors to the Games were reported to be still under construction upon arrival, as well as missing basic furniture from some of the rooms that had finished construction. The issues forced a number of visitors to seek alternate accommodations. Other problems reported included "piles of garbage" on the streets of the media village, as well as significant construction noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher= The Telegraph (London) |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/10620602/Winter-Olympics-visitors-complain-about-Sochi-construction-sites.html |title= Winter Olympics visitors complain about Sochi 'construction sites' |date= 5 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of mourning symbols==
During the [[Cross-country skiing at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Women's 15 kilometre skiathlon|women's 15 kilometre skiathlon]] four Norwegian skiers used black mourning binds in honor of teammate [[Astrid Uhrenholdt Jacobsen]]'s brother who had died unexpectedly on the opening day of the Olympics.

They argued it gave the three an aerodynamic advantage over the rest of the field. Both countries first appealed to the [[International Ski Federation]], but were rejected since they appealed hours after the end of the competition (when the deadline was 15 minutes after the close of the race). The appeal to the court was ultimately unsuccessful as well, because the court agreed with the ski federation that the appeal was filed past the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Canada's skicross appeal over altered pants dismissed|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/sochi2014/2014/02/23/canadas_skicross_appeal_over_altered_pants_dismissed.html |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |location=[[Sochi]], [[Russia]] |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |date=23 February 2014 |accessdate= March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fair Grounds Field''' is a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], located next to [[Independence Stadium (Shreveport)|Independence Stadium]] on the Louisiana State Fair Grounds just off [[Interstate 20]]. Fair Grounds Field opened in 1986 and underwent renovations in 1999, 2009, and 2011. The stadium has a [[seating capacity]] of 4,200 people.

Fair Grounds Field currently does not have a primary tenant. In the past it has most notably served as the home field of the [[Shreveport Captains]], [[Shreveport Swamp Dragons]], [[Shreveport-Bossier Sports]], and [[Shreveport-Bossier Captains]] [[minor league]] and independent baseball teams. Fair Grounds Field hosted the 1986 and 1995 [[Texas League]] All-Star Games, 2004 [[The Summit League Baseball Tournament|Summit League Baseball Tournament]], and 2011 [[Southwestern Athletic Conference Baseball Tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swac.org/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=27400&amp;ATCLID=205398796|title=2010-11 Championships|publisher=SWAC.org|accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair Grounds Field has hosted many college baseball teams including [[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU]], [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs baseball|Louisiana Tech]], [[Northwestern State Demons|Northwestern State]], [[Centenary Gentlemen|Centenary]], and [[Louisiana State University in Shreveport|LSU–Shreveport]]. The facility has also been used by local high school baseball teams.

{{hatnote|"Fool's mate" is sometimes used to mean [[Scholar's mate]].}}
In [[chess]], '''Fool's Mate''', also known as the '''Two-Move Checkmate''', is the [[checkmate]] in the fewest possible number of moves from the start of the game. This can be achieved only by Black, who can deliver checkmate on move 2 with the queen. Fool's Mate received its name because it can only occur if White commits an extraordinary [[Blunder (chess)|blunder]]. Even among rank beginners, the mate almost never occurs in practice.

An example of Fool's Mate consists of the moves:

:1. [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. f3|f3]] [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. f3/1...e5|e5]]
:2. [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. f3/1...e5/2. g4|g4??]] [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. f3/1...e5/2. g4/2...Qh4|Qh4]]{{chessAN|#}}

resulting in the position shown. The pattern can have slight variations; Black could play ...e6 or ...e5, and White could play f4 rather than f3. Additionally, the order in which White advances their f- and g-pawns could be alternated.

==Similar traps==
Similar mating patterns can occur early in the game. For example, in '''1. e4 g5 2. d4 f6{{chesspunc|??}} 3. Qh5{{chessAN|#}}''', the basic Fool's Mate pattern is the same: a player advances their f- and g-pawns, which permits the enemy [[queen (chess)|queen]] to mate along the unblocked diagonal. One such Fool's Mate is widely reported to have occurred in a possibly apocryphal 1959 game between Masefield and Trinka&lt;ref&gt;The names are also recorded as Mayfield or Mansfield and Trinks or Trent depending on the source consulted.&lt;/ref&gt; which lasted just three moves: '''1. e4 g5 2. Nc3 f5?? 3.

A well-known {{chessgloss|trap}} in the [[Dutch Defence]] occurred in the game Frank Melville Teed vs. [[Eugene Delmar]], 1896:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1242990 Teed vs. Delmar]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opening up a [[flight square]] for the king at f8 with 6...Bg7 would have prolonged the game. White still wins with 7.Qf5! Nf6 8.Bh6 Bxh6 9.gxh7 Bxh1 (9...e6 opens another flight square at e7; then White checks with 10.Qg6+ Ke7) 10.Qg6+ Kf8 11.Qxh6+ Kf7 12.Nh3, but much slower than in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lev Alburt |title=Chess Openings for White, Explained |publisher=Chess Information Research Center |year=2011 |page=509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered one of the most successful cyclists of his generation, [[Greg LeMond]] competed at a time when [[doping (sport)|performance-enhancing drugs]] [[List_of_doping_cases_in_cycling#1980s|were well known in his sport]], including blood doping at the 1984 LA Olympics. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of doping in cycling: http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Performance-Enhancing_Drugs.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Clean cycling is an illusion”, Francesco Moser one hour record holder from 1984: http://www.dailypeloton.com/displayarticle.asp?pk=10163 |date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lemond claims that from his earliest days of professional cycling, he was strongly against taking drugs to alter performance (although there are few records of him speaking out during his career), and his career is not as tarnished by suspicions as his contemporaries or successors. His willingness (after his career) to speak out against doping and those prominent individuals involved in it (primarily Lance Armstrong) ended up inadvertently linking him with the sport’s [[Doping in cycling|doping scandal]] controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tinley|first=Josh|title=Bummed About Lance Armstrong?

But his legacy and credibility are linked to the sport’s doping scandals because he has been so outspoken on the topic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his opposition to fraud, corruption and what he saw as complicity on the part of cycling officials, LeMond became a lightning rod of sorts for the sports most prominent personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Slater|first=Matt|title=Greg LeMond ready to help cycling's post-Armstrong clean-up|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cycling/20602191|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|"What LeMond has in buckets is authenticity. Unlike Armstrong, he is a real all-American hero. LeMond did it clean. Blessed with a remarkable engine, the "LeMonster" could climb, race, time-trial, and do it all over again the following day. He was a phenomenon and is unlucky to have won only three Tour titles. Already a world road race champion, he came third in his Tour debut in 1984, despite riding in support of victorious Frenchman Laurent Fignon."|group=N}}

In 2001 LeMond was one of the first professional cyclists of note, and the only former Tour champion, to openly express doubts over the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's three-consecutive Tour successes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Slater|first=Matt|title=Greg LeMond joins Change Cycling Now to clean up the sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cycling/20542662|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=29 November 2012|quote=The involvement of LeMond, who voiced his suspicions about Armstrong long before he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles by the UCI, is a coup for CCN as he is one of a select group of recent Tour champions to be untarnished by allegations of drug use. The 51-year-old Californian has been increasingly outspoken in recent years about the UCI's failure to address the culture of doping that has so badly damaged cycling's credibility, and last month he called for UCI president Pat McQuaid to resign.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/jul/30/cycling.cycling1|last=Fotheringham|first=William|title=Drugs issue refuses to go away due to winner's Ferrari links|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 December 2012|date=29 July 2001|quote=The rumblings about Lance Armstrong's work with the controversial Italian trainer Michele Ferrari continued yesterday, when Greg LeMond, a triple winner of the Tour, summed up the feelings of many on this Tour in saying: "When Lance won the prologue to the 1999 Tour I was close to tears, but when I heard he was working with Michele Ferrari I was devastated.

==UCI and Pat McQuaid==
[[File:Patrick McQuaid.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Former UCI President Pat McQuaid]]
In around 2006, LeMond had described [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI) as "corrupt" in an interview in ''[[L'Équipe]]'' about doping in the sport. In response the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] and [[Pat McQuaid]] threatened to sue him for defamation in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=coventry1/&gt;&lt;ref name="UCI's failure to silence LeMond"/&gt; In 2007 LeMond, inspired by a positive experience at [[L'Étape du Tour]], felt that perhaps the [[Tour de France]] could start a clean-up in the sport by separating from UCI. He made his feelings known to [[Patrice Clerc]] and [[Christian Prudhomme]]. LeMond soon after received a letter from UCI's [[Pat McQuaid]] threatening him with another lawsuit.&lt;ref name=coventry1/&gt;

Said LeMond: "It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case, another chance will not arise.

Lemond came to support British Cycling president Brian Cookson in the UCI Presidential battle. Said Lemond: “I have met and spent some time discussing with Brian about where cycling lost its way, how it lost its way, and what to do to bring the sport back to where it is not only a sport that leads by example, but a sport that inspires people once again. I feel confident after meeting Brian that his interest is to bring honest and transparent leadership to a sport that so desperately needs it. My hope is Brian will be the one to bring all interested parties together to once and for all do what was needed to be done years before, find solutions, both short term and long term, and to make it a priority that cycling comes first, not the other way around.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stokes|first=Shane|title=Triple Tour de France winner Greg LeMond backs Brian Cookson in UCI Presidential battle|url=http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/15372/Triple-Tour-de-France-winner-Greg-LeMond-backs-Brian-Cookson-in-UCI-Presidential-battle.aspx|date=August 31, 2013|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lance Armstrong and Trek==

Following LeMond's 2001 statement, Trek threatened LeMond with litigation and financial consequences, according to a 2008 lawsuit by LeMond Cycles against Trek. Trek had been licensing LeMond cycles since the 1990s and the brand had become successful. Armstrong's business relationship with Trek had become very strong as well after his Tour victories.&lt;ref name=trek2&gt;

Three years later, in 2004, LeMond spoke out again.  On the heels of successive Tour de France wins by Armstrong, LeMond stated: "If Armstrong's clean, it's the greatest comeback. And if he's not, then it's the greatest fraud."  He went public with the fallout of his 2001 statement, alleging that Armstrong had threatened to defame him, and threatened his business interests as well:
&lt;blockquote &gt;"[Armstrong] basically said 'I could find 10 people that will say you took EPO'...&amp;nbsp;The week after, I got multiple people that were on Lance ... Lance's camp, basically saying 'You better be quiet,' and I was quiet for three years. I have a business ...

The same month, LeMond also stated to French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'': "Lance is ready to do anything to keep his secret. I don't know how he can continue to convince everybody of his innocence."&lt;ref name="espn1840215"&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=1840215 Reporter denies Lance's allegations].

In a 2007 interview, LeMond accused Armstrong of trying to sabotage his relationship with Trek bicycles, and described him by saying "I just think he's not a good person and that's all I can say. I mean, he's a facade, if you knew the real Lance Armstrong that I know. I think he fronts himself as a guy who is loving and caring.

And I don't believe he'll finish up having any friends in cycling."&lt;ref name="rouleur"&gt;Interview in ''Rouleur,'' Guy Andrews, issue five, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In response Armstrong pointed the finger back at LeMond and suggested an iron injection LeMond received during the 1989 Giro d'Italia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20040717&amp;slug=toursnapshot17 | work=The Seattle Times | first=Mark | last=Akins | title=The soigneur is every cyclist's best friend | date=July 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in reality an injection of EPO or some other performance-enhancing agent.  “We will have the opportunity to tell the truth to the authorities, and Greg LeMond will tell the truth about 1989 I hope, because he, too, needs to tell the truth.

In March 2008, [[LeMond Racing Cycles|LeMond Cycling Inc]] sued Trek for failing to properly promote and distribute the LeMond brand, and for attempting to "silence" LeMond's public comments about doping, attributing this to the influence of Armstrong on Trek.&lt;ref name=trek2/&gt; Trek responded in April 2008 by severing business ties with LeMond.&lt;ref name=trek1&gt;[http://www.trekbikes.com/pdf/media/en/Trek_PressRelease_FINAL.pdf TREK TO IMMEDIATELY SEVER RELATIONSHIP WITH GREG LEMOND] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609190914/http://www.trekbikes.com/pdf/media/en/Trek_PressRelease_FINAL.pdf |date=2012-06-09 }}, Media Release, trekbikes.com, 2008 4 8, retr 2012 10 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2007, LeMond testified at a [[USADA]] hearing convened to weigh the evidence of doping by [[Floyd Landis]] during the [[2006 Tour de France]]. Under oath, LeMond described a phone conversation he had with Landis on August 6, 2006, as well as another with Landis' business manager, Will Geoghegan, on May 16, 2007, the evening before LeMond appeared to testify. The major points of the testimony were:
*In an August 6 phone conversation, LeMond said he told Landis that "If you did (admit to having used banned substances), you could single-handedly change the sport. You could be the one who will salvage the sport."  LeMond said Landis responded by saying "What good would it do? If I did, it would destroy a lot of my friends and hurt a lot of people."&lt;ref name="bend0518" /&gt;
* In their conversation, LeMond had disclosed his history of childhood [[Child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]] to Landis, and said the secret had nearly destroyed him. LeMond stated he warned Landis. "(Lying about doping) will come back to haunt you when you are 40 or 50. If you have a moral compass and ethics, this will destroy you."&lt;ref name="bend0518" /&gt;
* Will Geoghegan attempted to stop LeMond's testimony by calling LeMond at his personal mobile phone number. LeMond reported that Geoghegan claimed he was "his uncle" and that he would be at the hearing to talk about what had happened between them.&lt;ref name="nbcs0518"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/landis-aide-threatens-lemond-article-1.252562|last=Quin |first=T.J. |work=New York Daily News | title=Landis aide threatens LeMond| date=2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; LeMond's [[BlackBerry]], with Geoghegan's phone number captured in the call log, was entered into evidence.&lt;ref name="bend0518" /&gt;

LeMond's testimony was supported by an online posting Landis made on the Daily Peloton forum in which Landis stated that LeMond had disclosed personal information of a sensitive nature to Landis, and Landis threatened to use that information to damage LeMond if LeMond continued to speak out about Landis' doping case.

===Aftermath of the Landis testimony===
Several weeks after his testimony, Greg LeMond and his wife Kathy gave an extensive interview to the ''[[Sunday Times]]''. He provided additional details on the circumstances of his 2001 apology to Armstrong, stating that [[Trek Bicycle Corporation|Trek]], the longtime manufacturer and distributor of LeMond Racing Cycles, had threatened to end the relationship at the behest of Armstrong. He described the two years that followed the forced apology as the worst in his life, marked by self-destructive behavior that ultimately led him to disclose his sexual abuse to his wife and seek help. LeMond also described how being a victim of molestation had impacted both his racing career and his life since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/cycling/article2010066.ece Cycle of Abuse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605063556/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/cycling/article2010066.ece |date=June 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, Greg LeMond became a founding board member of the non-profit organization [[1in6|1in6.org]], whose mission is "to help men who have had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences in childhood live healthy, happy lives".&lt;ref name="1in6"&gt;[http://www.1in6.org 1in6.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, after Floyd Landis admitted to doping while riding for Armstrong's USPS team and later at Phonak, he personally contacted LeMond to apologize for the events of 2007, and the two reconciled their differences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703691804575255410855321120 "Cyclist Armstrong Denies Doping"] Reed Albergotti, ''Wall Street Journal,'' May 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/cycling/news/story?id=5211166|last=Ford |first=Bonnie D.|title=Landis makes amends with LeMond|work=ESPN.com |date=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he declined to make details of the conversation public, LeMond acknowledged his support of Landis and sought to assist his former adversary in obtaining legal representation for the ensuing US federal investigation. LeMond told the NY Daily News he believed 'most of Floyd Landis' statements' about doping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2010/05/20/2010-05-20_greg_lemond_believes_most_of_floyd_landis_statements_about_doping_in_cycling.html "Greg LeMond believes 'most of Floyd Landis' statements' about doping"] Nathaniel Vinton, ''New York Daily News,'' May 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Troy Landis empathized to CyclingNews in 2015 that LeMond has personal distaste for Armstrong however has preference of some other riders: “For example just last year (2014) he was seen waving to crowds from a VIP car at the Tour along with Indurain and Hinault. Greg himself claims to have quit racing in the early 90s because EPO showed up and that is exactly when Indurain began winning. If clean riders were a victim of doping in the Armstrong era and he was a victim of doping in the early 90s then it defies reason why those two should be treated so differently,” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/landis-lemonds-anti-doping-stance-on-lance-armstrong-lacks-consistency/ "Landis Lemond's Antidoping Stance on Lance Armstrong Lacks Consistency"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alberto Contador==
[[File:Alberto Contador Paris-Nice 2007.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Alberto Contador]]
On July 23, 2009, LeMond wrote an [[opinion article]]&lt;ref name="leMonde-LeMond"&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/2009/07/23/alberto-prouve-moi-qu-on-peut-croire-en-toi-par-greg-lemond_1221871_0.html Alberto, prove to me that we can believe in you]. Lemonde.fr (July 23, 2009). Retrieved on August 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' where he questioned the validity of [[Alberto Contador]]'s climb up [[Verbier]] in the [[2009 Tour de France]]. In the piece, LeMond calculated that Contador's [[VO2 max]] was beyond what could be obtained without performance-enhancing products.  The article stirred a fair amount of controversy as it put to question the Tour's best rider.  A normal man might have a VO2 max between 38 and 43 ml/kg/min. LeMond had calculated Contador's VO2 max up the Verbier at 99.5 ml/kg/min. This is an astonishingly high number.  Excellent endurance athletes when highly trained may reach into the 80s.  Lance Armstrong had a VO2 max calculated at 85 ml/kg/min.  Miguel Indurain had achieved a VO2 max of 88 ml/kg/min.   Though LeMond's own VO2 max had at one time been calculated at an astounding 92.5 ml/kg/min, this was extremely unusual without performance-enhancing products, and was still significantly below that which LeMond calculated for Contador.&lt;ref&gt;Moore p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ttwvo2test"&gt;[http://texastailwind.wordpress.com/2009/02/13/vo2-to-the-max-performing-a-cycling-vo2-max-test/ Texastailwind VO2 max testing]&lt;/ref&gt;  Said LeMond: "The burden is then on Alberto Contador to prove he is physically capable of performing this feat without the use of performance-enhancing products."  Other experts in exercise physiology questioned LeMond's calculation of 99.5 ml/kg/min. In an article appearing in Cyclingnews.com that same day as LeMond's piece, expert Andrew Coggan questioned LeMond's conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/contadors-climbing-credibility-questioned |last=Weislo|first=Laura|title=Contador's climbing credibility questioned|date=July 23, 2009|work=Cycling News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said Coggan: "a more reasonable estimate of Contador's power during that ascent is about 450 W, which would require a sustained VO2 of 'only' 80 mL/kg/min", which is "still high, but not so high that you can definitively state that it can only be achieved via doping." Using Coggan's numbers, if Contador had been operating at 90% up the climb of the Verbier, his VO2 Max would still be remarkably high at 89 mL/kg/min.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Contador did not test positive for doping at the [[2009 Tour de France|2009 Tour]]. However, the following year he tested positive for [[clenbuterol]] after winning the [[2010 Tour de France|2010 Tour]]. On February 6, 2012, the Court of Arbitration for Sport stripped Contador of his results from July 2010 to February 2012, including his 2010 Tour and [[Giro d'Italia|2011 Giro]] titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{spanish name 2|Montes|Moreno}}
'''Miguel Ángel Montes Moreno''' (born 12 February 1980 in [[Sensuntepeque]]) is a [[Salvadoran]] former [[Association football|footballer]] last on the team [[Alianza F.C.|Alianza]] in the [[Primera División (El Salvador)|Salvadoran First Division]].

==Club career==
On 13 November 2009, Montes was linked with a move to the [[Primera División de México|Primera División]] (First Division) club [[Indios de Ciudad Juárez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''La Prensa Grafico''|title=A hablar en México|url=http://www.laprensagrafica.com/deportes/futbol-nacional/72664-a-hablar-en-mexico.html|accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not sign with the club, as Indios coach José Treviño stated that reinforcements, including Montes, would not be brought in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''El Mexicano''|title=Indios no realizará contrataciones "boom"|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elmexicano/notas/n1408229.htm|accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April 2011, Miguel Montes left [[C.D. Águila]] after 2 years in the club, first being capped in the [[Primera División de Fútbol Profesional – Apertura 2009|Apertura 2009]]. He left because the club had not paid him for over a month and a half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''El Grafico''|title=Montes deja al Águila |url=http://www.elgrafico.com/destacado-portada/36-destacadas/11568-montes-deja-al-aguila.html|accessdate=2011-04-15|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 2011, Miguel Montes signed for one year at Isidro Metapán. He told a Salvadoran radio station, "I'm happy because I reached an agreement with the people of Isidro Metapán, they were interested like me and came to the concentration, spoke with me and we reached an agreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''El Salvador FC''|title=Miguel Montes firmó con Isidro Metapán|url=http://www.elsalvadorfc.com/2011-05-14-montes-se-va-para-metapan|accessdate=15 May 2011|language=es|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730210619/http://www.elsalvadorfc.com/2011-05-14-montes-se-va-para-metapan|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 2012, he signed for [[Alianza F.C.|Alianza]].&lt;ref&gt;http://futbol.univision.com/centroamerica/el-salvador/article/2012-05-11/el-isidro-metapan-confirmo-bajas-y-busca-portero#axzz1uPiMWo7k&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Montes received call ups to the national team in 1998 and in 2001, but did not get his first cap until 24 May 2004, in a friendly match against [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''RSSSF'' |title=Qualifying Tournament for Gold Cup 2001 - Details |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesg/gold-cam01det.html |accessdate=2008-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024005059/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesg/gold-cam01det.html |archivedate=2008-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''RSSSF''|title=International Matches 2004 - North and Central America and Caribbean|url=http://www.rsssf.com/intldetails/2004nca.html|accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Haiti game, Montes was once again neglected by national team coaches, that is until June 2007 when Mexican coach [[Carlos de los Cobos]] called him up to participate in the [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. Although he missed out on the opening two game, Montes did play in the team's third and final cup game against the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]]. Since then, Montes has become a mainstay with the national team.

On 20 March 2010, Montes was given a one-year ban and a fine of $250 by the El Salvador Football Federation on account of not wearing the team's sponsored kit. He wore gloves and socks for a different sponsor on numerous occasions, including the Gold Cup in the U.S in 2009.
The federation signed a $600,000 deal with the sponsor in 2008, meaning all players were to wear the same sponsored kit to fulfill the sponsorship deal. [http://www.zimbio.com/Miguel+Montes/articles/dXNCXzG2ir-/El+Salvador+Goalkeeper+Miguel+Montes+Suspended]

After a year of suspension, Montes was called up by then coach [[José Luis Rugamas]] in a friendly international against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]] on 24 March 2011.

'''Military patrol''' was a team [[winter sport]] in which athletes competed in [[cross-country skiing]], [[ski mountaineering]] and [[rifle shooting]]. It was usually contested between countries or [[military unit]]s. 

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-12927, Riesengebirge, Reichswehrübung.jpg|thumb|Start of a German [[Reichswehr]] military training patrol team in the [[Karkonosze|Giant Mountains]], 1932.]]
The military patrol competition encompassed 25 kilometer cross-country skiing (15&amp;nbsp;km for women) and rifle shooting. The size of the patrol was four members. The total climb had to be from 500 to 1200 meters (300 to 700 for women). The rules were very similar to modern biathlon. Traditionally the participating patrol had to consist of one [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]], one [[non-commissioned officer]] (NCO) and two [[private (rank)|privates]]. The officer carried a [[pistol]] instead of a rifle and did not take part in the shooting. The total weight of the backpacks of the NCO and the privates had to be at least 24 kilograms. In later years the competitors did not carry backpacks, and the rifles were small bore rifles, similar to those in biathlon. The patrol leader did not have any kind of weapon.

Military patrol formed part of the [[International Military Sports Council]] (''Conseil International du Sport Militaire'', or CISM) skiing championships starting in 1929. It was in the official programme of the [[Winter Olympic Games]] in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924 Chamonix]],{{refn|group=nb|name=IOCMilitaryPatrol}} and on three occasions as a [[demonstration sport]] (1928, 1936 and 1948). In 1924, the military patrol team member [[Camille Mandrillon]] took the Olympic Oath on behalf of the competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Winter Games|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Opening_ceremony_of_the_Olympic_Winter_Games.pdf|work=Factsheet|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=20 March 2013|page=5|date=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successor sports==
[[Biathlon]] was developed from military patrol.{{refn |name=IOCMilitaryPatrol |group=nb|The official website of the Olympic Movement now treats Men's Military Patrol at the 1924 games as an event within the sport of [[Biathlon]].&lt;ref name=IOC1924Biathlon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/content/results-and-medalists/gamesandsportsummary/?sport=31666&amp;games=1924%2F2&amp;event=

(Skiing Competitions - Juries - Military Race)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another military skiing event is the [[Patrouille des Glaciers]], today also including competitions and rankings for civilian competitors.

'''''Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association''''', No. 16-476, was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The issue was whether the U.S. federal government has the right to control state lawmaking. The State of New Jersey sought to have the [[Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992|Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act]] (PASPA) overturned, allowing state-sponsored [[sports betting]]. The case, formerly titled ''Christie v. National Collegiate Athletic Association'' until Governor [[Chris Christie]] left office, was combined with ''NJ Thoroughbred Horsemen v. NCAA'' No. 16-477.

The pro-betting side characterized the federal government's position as ''[[commandeering]]'', promulgating federal laws that the states would have the responsibility to enforce.&lt;ref name="cnn171204"&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Vogue|first1=Ariane|title=Chris Christie goes to the Supreme Court on sports betting|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/04/politics/christie-scotus-sports-betting/index.html|accessdate=4 December 2017|publisher=CNN|date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The outcome of this case is likely to be cited in future cases involving the legalization of marijuana, where a similar state–federal question exists.&lt;ref name="clr130321"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Davis|title=High Federalism: Marijuana Legalization and the Limits of Federal Power to Regulate States|journal=Cardozo Law Review|date=March 21, 2013|volume=35|issue=567|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2237618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stern|first=Mark Joseph|title=Three Cheers for Federalism|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/05/justice-alitos-opinion-on-sports-betting-shows-up-federalism-can-be-good-for-liberals.html|date=May 14, 2018|access-date=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2018, the Court reversed lower court findings, favoring New Jersey in deciding that PASPA violated the anticommandeering principle by a 7–2 vote, and declared the entire law unconstitutional by a 6–3 vote.

==Facts and prior history==

In 1992, Congress passed the [[Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992|Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act]] (PASPA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 3701-3704, to prohibit state-sanctioned sports gambling; the law stated that states may not "sponsor, operate, advertise, promote, license, or authorize by law or compact" sports gambling.&lt;ref name="wapost"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/12/04/place-your-bets-on-federalism-thoughts-on-todays-oral-argument-in-christie-v-ncaa/ | title = Place your bets on federalism — thoughts on today's oral argument in Christie v. NCAA | first = Ilya | last = Somin | date = December 4, 2017 | accessdate = March 16, 2018 | work = [[Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law made exemptions for gambling in four states: [[Nevada]], [[Delaware]], [[Oregon]], and [[Montana]] which had established legal sports gambling regulations in place. [[New Jersey]] had attempted to apply for the exemption but failed to act in 1991 before this exemption window closed, in part due to state-level political issues.&lt;ref name="ap may2012"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nj-gov-chris-christie-let-them-try-to-stop-us-from-sports-betting/ | title = N.J.

Since around 2010, New Jersey has sought to challenge the federal law, recognizing the state was losing potential revenue (upwards of {{USD|600 million}}, estimated from a 2008 report by financial analysis firm [[Cantor Fitzgerald]]) from sports gambling licenses and fees to these four states and illicit offshore entities. &lt;ref name="ap may2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nj.com/insidejersey/index.ssf/2010/08/can_sports_betting_save_new_je.html | title = Could sports betting save New Jersey? | first = Bob | last = Considine | date = August 9, 2010 | accessdate = March 16, 2018 | work = [[The Star-Ledger]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; State Senators [[Raymond Lesniak]] and [[Stephen M. Sweeney]] led a lawsuit by the state to challenge the federal law, but it was rejected by the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey|United States District Court]] in March 2011, stating that only Governor [[Chris Christie]], through his attorney general's office, could file such a suit. At the time, Gov. Christie had been against pursuing any legislation as he believed it would be difficult to bypass the federal ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/09/senate_committee_hears_testimo.html | title = Casino, horse racing leaders push for legalization of sports betting in N.J. | first = MaryAnn | last=  Spoto | date= September 25, 2011 | accessdate = March 16, 2018 | work = [[The Star-Ledger]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Referendum===

New Jersey voters in 2011 voted overwhelmingly in a nonbinding referendum to create a state constitutional amendment that would permit sports gambling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/11/nj_residents_vote_on_legalizin.html | title = Sports betting backed by N.J. voters | first = MaryAnn | last = Spoto |date = November 8, 2011 | accessdate = March 16, 2018 | work =[[The Star-Ledger]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, the [[New Jersey Legislature]] enacted the Sports Wagering Act ("2012 Act"), allowing sports wagering at New Jersey casinos and racetracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/gov_christie_signs_bill_allowi_4.html | title = Gov.

In court hearings, the state argued they were aware that the 2012 Act violated PASPA, but they contended that PASPA violated the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]'s protection against anti-commandeering federal laws that stripped the power of the state to repeal their own sports gambling ban.&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/16-476 | title = Christie v.

Shipp]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] rejected the state's argument, and ruled for the leagues finding that there was "an undisputed direct link between legalized gambling and harm to the Leagues", and granted an injunction on New Jersey from enforcing the 2012 law.&lt;ref name="epsn history"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/22605881/new-jersey-vs-leagues | title = The odds of legalized sports betting: New Jersey vs. the leagues | first1 = David | last1=  Purdum | first2 = Ryan | last2= Rodenberg | date = March 3, 2018 | accessdate=  March 16, 2018 | work = [[EPSN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit Appeals Court]], but the court, in a 2-1 split decision, upheld the District Court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Governor of New Jersey |vol=730 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=208 |pinpoint= |court=3d Cir. |date=October 19, 2013 |url=http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/131713p.pdf |accessdate=March 18, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Circuit opinion noted the distinction between "affirmative authorizations" specifically prevented in PASPA, and the act of repealing the state's law.&lt;ref name="cornell"/&gt; The opinion stated: "We do not read PASPA to prohibit New Jersey from repealing its ban on sports wagering".&lt;ref name="epsn history"/&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] refused to hear the case by June 2014.&lt;ref name="epsn history"/&gt;

===Revision of the law===

Based on the repealing language from the Third Circuit's decision on ''Christie I'', Sen. Lesniak revised the 2012 law with the approval of the Justice Department. The revised bill, instead of authorizing sports gambling, repealed portions of existing New Jersey laws from 1977 that had banned sports gambling, citing the Third Circuit's decision, effectively making sports gambling legal within certain establishments (for example, the bill did not allow for underage gambling, and preventing gambling on teams from New Jersey).&lt;ref name="cornell"/&gt; While it passed the New Jersey Legislature, Gov. Christie vetoed it, believing it was an attempt to bypass the Third Circuit's ruling.&lt;ref name="epsn history"/&gt; However, in September 2014, Gov. Christie changed his mind, and supported the legislation's attempt to grant sports betting rights in the states; within five weeks, Lesniak's new legislation was signed into law. The five leagues sued the state again in November 2014, creating ''Christie II''. Both the District Court and Third Circuit found in favor of the leagues, that New Jersey's revised law still violated the PASPA; in both Courts, the judges saw the act of repealing only portions of previous state laws equivalent to affirmative authorizations", and thus still violated PASPA.&lt;ref name="epsn history"/&gt;  While the Third Circuit decision was still split, the author of the original decision dissented the new ruling, leading the state to request an ''[[en banc]]'' hearing of the full Third Circuit.&lt;ref name="epsn history"/&gt; The full Circuit still favored the leagues, 9-3, in their August 2016 decision, stating that PAPSA does not commandeer the states because it "does not command states to take affirmative actions...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=National Collegiate Athletic Association v.

== Supreme Court ==
Encouraged by the language in the dissenting opinions from the Third Circuit on ''Christie II'', New Jersey petitioned for a writ of [[certiorari]] from the Supreme Court in October 2016. The state specifically asked the question "Does a federal statute that prohibits modification or repeal of state-law prohibitions on private conduct impermissibly commandeer the regulatory power of States?," citing ''[[New York v. United States]]'', {{ussc|505|144|1992|el=no}}, as precedent. The Court accepted to hear the case June 27, 2017.&lt;ref name="epsn history"/&gt;&lt;ref name = nj170628&gt;{{cite news | last1=Johnson | first1=Brent |last2 =Salant |first2 =Jonathan | title=U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear N.J. sports betting case | url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/06/supreme_court_agrees_to_hear_nj_sports_betting_case.html | date= June 28, 2017 | publisher= ''Star Ledger'' | accessdate=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The case was combined with ''NJ Thoroughbred Horsemen v. NCAA'', a petition to the Supreme Court filed by the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association (NJTHA) who had joined the state in its case in the District and Third Circuit court. The NJTHA is the licensed permit for gambling at [[Monmouth Park Racetrack]], and they argued that because of the lower courts' stance on PASPA from ''Christie II'', the economic viability of the Racetrack was at a severe economic disadvantage without the legal authority to bet on horse races. While they filed their petition separately to reflect the commercial impact of the situation, their question to the Supreme Court was the same of whether PASPA commandeered power from the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16-477-cert-petition.pdf | title = On Petition For Writ Of Certiorari To The United States Court Of Appeals For The Third Circuit  | date = September 26, 2016 | accessdate = March 19, 2018 | publisher = SCOTUS Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the case, [[Phil Murphy]] was elected Governor of New Jersey, and the case, initially filed as ''Christie v. National Collegiate Athletic Association'', was renamed to ''Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/16/16-476/28553/20180119165048861_16-476%20Letter%20to%20SCT%20re%20name%20change.pdf | title = Christie v.

During the course of the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate [[Donald Trump]] expressed his support for legalized sports betting.&lt;ref name = fox141102&gt;{{cite news | last1=Purdum|first1 =David | title=Highlights from Donald Trump’s Interview on THE HERD WITH COLIN COWHERD | url=http://www.foxsports.com/presspass/latest-news/2015/11/02/highlights-from-donald-trumps-interview-on-the-herd-with-colin-cowherd | date= Nov 2, 2015 | publisher= ''Fox Sports'' | accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2017, Trump appointee, acting Solicitor General [[Jeff Wall (lawyer)|Jeffrey B.

The Court heard the combined docket oral arguments December 4, 2017.&lt;ref name="gn171016"&gt;{{cite web|title=GRANTED &amp; NOTED LIST CASES FOR ARGUMENT IN OCTOBER TERM 2017|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/17grantednotedlist.pdf|publisher=Supreme Court of the United States|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oral171204"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral Arguments in Christie v.

Justice [[Samuel Alito]] wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices [[John Roberts]], [[Anthony Kennedy]], [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Elena Kagan]], and [[Neil Gorsuch]], and in part by Justice [[Stephen Breyer]]. The majority opinion agreed that one specific clause of PASPA, 28 U.S.C. §§ 3701(1), did commandeer power from the states to regulate their own gambling industries, following ''New York v. United States'', and thus was unconstitutional, reversing the Third Circuit decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-allows-sports-betting-across-country-n868956 | title = Supreme Court allows sports betting across the country | first = Pete | last = Williams | date = May 14, 2018 | accessdate = May 14, 2018 | work = [[NBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alito wrote "Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not."&lt;ref name="usa today decision"/&gt; Regarding the distinction between Congress preventing the states from taking an action versus Congress requiring the states to take an action, Alito wrote, "This distinction is empty. It was a matter of happenstance that the laws challenged in ''New York'' and ''Printz'' commanded "affirmative" action as opposed to imposing a prohibition. The basic principle—that Congress cannot issue direct orders to state legislatures—applies in either event."{{fact|date=May 2018}} 

The court rejected the respondents' argument that the anti-authorization provision was a valid [[federal preemption|preemption]] of state law under the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-476_dbfi.pdf slip op.] at 21-24&lt;/ref&gt; The Supremacy Clause, the court pointed out, "is not an independent grant of legislative power to Congress" but "[i]nstead, it simply provides a rule of decision."&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', slip op. at 21&lt;/ref&gt; For a federal provision to validly preempt state law, "it must represent the exercise of a power conferred on Congress by the Constitution[,] pointing to the Supremacy Clause will not do"&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', slip op. at 21&lt;/ref&gt;, and "since the Constitution confers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States, [the] provision at issue must be best read as one that regulates private actors."&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', slip op. at 21 (internal citation and quotation marks removed)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The court then outlined the three types of preemption, illustrated with cases. In ''[[Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett]]'', an example of conflict preemption, federal law enacted under Congress' [[Commerce Clause]] authority prohibited generic drug manufacturers from changing the composition or labeling of drugs approved by the [[Federal Drug Administration]], thus state tort law could not force or hold liable a generic drug manufacturer for adding additional information to the FDA-approved label.&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', slip op. at 22 (citing ''Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett'', 570 U.S. 472 (2013)).&lt;/ref&gt; Express preemption "operates in essentially the same way, but this is often obscured by the language used by Congress in framing preemption provisions."&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', slip op. at 21&lt;/ref&gt; The court illustrated express preemption with ''Morales v. Trans World Airlines'' concerning a provision of the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] that used language that seemed directed to the states and similar to the issue in ''Murphy'': 
{{quote|[T]o ensure that the States would not undo federal deregulation with  regulation of their own, the Act provided that 'no State or political subdivision thereof...shall enact or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law relating to rates, routes, or services of any [covered] air carrier.' This language might appear to operate directly on the States, but it is a mistake to be confused by the way in which a preemption provision is phrased. As we recently explained, we do not require Congress to employ a particular linguistic formulation when preempting state law. And if we look beyond the phrasing employed in the Airline Deregulation Act’s preemption provision, it is clear that this provision operates just like any other federal law with preemptive effect. It confers on private entities (i.e., covered carriers) a federal right to engage in certain conduct subject only to certain (federal) constraints."&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', slip op. at 22-23 (quoting 49 U. S. C. App. §1305(a)(1) (1988 ed.))(internal citations and some internal quotation marks removed)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Field preemption, the third type of preemption, occurs when federal regulation of a "'field' of regulation [is] so comprehensive[] that it has left no room for supplementary state legislation."&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', slip op. at 23 (internal punctuation altered)&lt;/ref&gt; The court noted that even it used the same sort of abbreviated description as Congress has done in express preemption, such as involved in ''Morales'', in a 2015 case where the court described field preemption: "Congress has forbidden the State to take action in the ''field'' that the federal statute pre-empts."&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', slip op. at 23 (quoting ''Oneok, Inc. v. Learjet, Inc.'', slip  op.  at  2 (2015))&lt;/ref&gt; However, "in substance, field preemption does not involve congressional commands to the States",&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', slip op. at 23&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; but "like all other forms of preemption, it concerns a clash between a constitutional exercise of Congress’s legislative power and conflicting state law."&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', slip op. at 23&lt;/ref&gt; The court then explained why preemption was not applicable to the PASPA provision prohibiting states from authorizing sports betting:
{{quote|In sum, regardless of the language sometimes used by Congress and this Court, every form of preemption is based on a federal law that regulates the conduct of private actors, not the States. Once this is understood, it is clear that the PASPA provision prohibiting state authorization of sports gambling is not a preemption provision because there is no way in which this provision can be understood as a regulation of private actors. It certainly does not confer any federal rights on private actors interested in conducting sports gambling operations. (It does not give them a federal right to engage in sports gambling.) Nor does it impose any federal restrictions on private actors. If a private citizen or company started a sports gambling operation, either with or without state authorization, §3702(1) would not be violated and would not provide any ground for a civil action by the Attorney General or any other party. Thus, there is simply no way to understand the provision prohibiting state authorization as anything other than a direct command to the States. And that is exactly what the anticommandeering rule does not allow.&lt;ref&gt;''Murphy'', slip op. at 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A question posed by the majority opinion was over the current [[severability]] doctrine employed by the Supreme Court at the time of this decision. Under this doctrine, if the Court finds a portion of the law passed by Congress is deemed unconstitutional, they must review all other aspects of that law based on the intent of Congress to determine if some or all of the law must be deemed unconstitutional. Alito and the five other justices that joined his opinion, excluding Breyer, believed §§ 3701(1) was unseverable from the remaining language of PASPA, and declared the law unconstitutional. In a concurrence, Justice Thomas affirmed that the use of the severability doctrine was the right course of action in this decision, but postulated that the Court should revisit this doctrine since it often requires hypothesizing the intent of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/05/opinion-analysis-justices-strike-down-federal-sports-gambling-law/ | title = Opinion analysis: Justices strike down federal sports gambling law  | first = Amy | last = Howe | date = May 14, 2018 | accessdate = May 14, 2018 | work = [[SCOTUS Blog]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Breyer, in his own written opinion, disagreed with Alito's opinion related to severability, believing the rest of the law could remain. Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] wrote the dissenting opinion, joined by Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and in part by Breyer. Justice Ginsburg wrote that the decision to overturn all of PASPA was excessive, and based on the desire to legalize sports betting.&lt;ref name="usa today decision"&gt;{{cite we | url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/14/supreme-court-strikes-down-ban-sports-betting-new-jersey/1053022001/ | title = Supreme Court strikes down ban on sports betting in victory for New Jersey | first=  Richard | last= Wolff | date = May 14, 2018 | accessdate=  May 14, 2018 | work = [[USA Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The oral arguments in the case were considered to have gone favorably towards New Jersey and against the leagues, and many commentators believed that the Court would find that PASPA was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="epsn history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/12/04/supreme-court-could-make-sports-betting-ban-underdog/919347001/ | title = Supreme Court could make sports-betting ban an underdog | first1 = Richard | last1= Wolf | first2= Herb |last2= Jackson | date = December 4, 2017 | accessdate = March 19, 2018 | work = [[USA Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In anticipation of the Court's ruling, several states have begun setting legislation in place to allow for legal sports gambling, contingent on the results of the Supreme Court case.  By June 5, 2018, Delaware became the first state outside of Nevada to legalize sports gambling in wake of the Supreme Court decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/sports/sports-betting-delaware.html | title = Delaware Kicks Off Full-Scale Sports Betting, a First Outside of Nevada | first =  Maya | last = Salam | date = June 5, 2018 | accessdate = June 8, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Jersey legislation had prepared a bill legalizing sports gambling prior to the Supreme Court ruling, and upon the Court's decision, formally introduced the bill the same day; the bill had undergone several revisions, and had passed both houses and signed into law by Governor Murphy by June 11, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/nyregion/sports-betting-new-jersey.html | title = Game On!

In some cases, the leagues have been involved in helping to establish the legislation to be favorable for them as well, should the Court find for New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/19740480/gambling-sports-betting-bill-tracker-all-50-states | title = Sports betting bill tracker | first = Ryan | last = Rodenberg | date = March 5, 2018 | accessdate = March 16, 2018 | work = [[ESPN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The professional leagues, like the NFL, NBA, and NHL, have also indicated they would agree to federally-regulated sports gambling and preparing their teams, owners, and players for this possibility, though the NCAA, representing non-professional players, has been more vocal about such allowances unless gambling on college or amateur sports remain banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/06/27/in-surprise-move-supreme-court-says-it-will-take-on-new-jersey-sports-betting-case/ | title = In surprise move, Supreme Court says it will take on New Jersey sports-betting case | first = Matt | last = Bonesteel | date =June 27, 2017 | accessdate = March 18, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/nyregion/new-jerseys-appeal-of-sports-betting-ban-heads-to-supreme-court.html | title = New Jersey’s Appeal of Sports Betting Ban Heads to Supreme Court | first1 = Nick | last1 = Corasanti | first2 = Joe | last2 = Drape | date = June 27, 2017 | accessdate = March 18, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/awaiting-supreme-court-decision-pro-sports-league-prepare-for-legal-betting/2018/03/16/ed631370-294a-11e8-bc72-077aa4dab9ef_story.html | title = Awaiting Supreme Court decision, pro sports leagues prepare for legal betting | first = Rick | last = Maese |date = March 18, 2018 | accessdate = March 19, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court decision only impacts intrastate sports gambling schemes.

With the Court finding in favor of New Jersey, observers believe its ruling will impact other current federal laws in place that could be considered to have commandeered power from the states and other challenges related to the Tenth Amendment, such as gun ownership rights, immigration enforcement (eg. penalizing [[Sanctuary city#United States|sanctuary cities]]), and the [[Legality of cannabis|legalization of marijuana]] under state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/12/26/new-jersey-sports-betting-case-supreme-court-could-affect-wide-array-issues/977955001/ | title = With New Jersey sports betting case, Supreme Court could affect wide array of issues | first = Herb | last = Jackson | date = December 26, 2017 | accessdate= March 19, 2018 | work = [[USA Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kamin|first1=Sam|title=Murphy v.

The '''Pontiac Silverdome''' (also known as simply the ''' Silverdome''') was a domed stadium in [[Pontiac, Michigan]]. It opened in 1975 and sat on 127 acres (51&amp;nbsp;ha) of land. When the stadium opened, it featured a [[fiberglass]] fabric roof held up by air pressure, the first use of the architectural technique in a major athletic facility. With a seating capacity of 82,000+, it was the largest stadium in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) until [[FedExField]] (91,000 capacity) in suburban Washington, D.C., opened in 1997.

It was primarily the home of the [[Detroit Lions]] of the NFL from 1975 to 2001 and was also home to the [[Detroit Pistons]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) from 1978 to 1988. In addition, the Silverdome also served as the home venue for the [[Detroit Express]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] and the [[Michigan Panthers]] of the [[United States Football League]], as well as two college [[bowl game]]s: the [[Cherry Bowl]] and the [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Motor City Bowl]]. In 2012, the Silverdome served as the home venue of the [[Detroit Mechanix]] of the [[American Ultimate Disc League]] and hosted the league championship game that season.

The stadium was a regular concert venue and hosted a number of athletic and non-athletic events, including the [[1979 NBA All-Star Game]], [[Super Bowl XVI]], [[WrestleMania III]], early round games of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], and regional games in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]].

After the opening of [[Ford Field]] in 2002, the stadium was left without a permanent tenant. It first closed in 2006, but after multiple attempts to solicit redevelopment plans, the city sold the stadium at auction in 2009 for only $550,000 (less than 1% of the cost to build the dome). It reopened in 2010 and hosted several events, but closed again, this time permanently, in 2013. The roof was destroyed by a winter storm. Owners auctioned the stadium's contents in 2014 with no future development through June 2015. 
The site of this stadium currently houses thousands of recalled Volkswagen vehicles

In 2017, the Silverdome was condemned and prepared for demolition; the upper ring of the stadium, which had supported the roof structure, was imploded on December 4, 2017, after a failed attempt the previous day. Following the implosion, the remains of the stadium were brought down in sections with hydraulic excavators, and the last free standing section was felled by late March 2018.&lt;ref name="Last wall of Silverdome felled"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Broda |first1=Natalie |title=Final wall of Silverdome falls, demo to be done by November |url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/general-news/20180430/final-wall-of-silverdome-falls-demo-to-be-done-by-november |accessdate=June 10, 2018 |work=The Oakland Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former uses==
The Silverdome hosted the [[Detroit Lions]] of the NFL (1975–2001), the [[Detroit Pistons]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] (1978–1988), the [[Detroit Express]] (for both [[Association football|outdoor]] and [[indoor soccer]]) of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|NASL]] (1978–1980), the [[Michigan Panthers]] of the [[United States Football League|USFL]] (1983–1984), college football's [[Cherry Bowl]] (1984–1985), the [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Motor City Bowl]] (1997–2001), the [[Michigan High School Athletic Association|MHSAA]] football state finals (1976–2004) and four first-round games during soccer's [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].

For the World Cup matches, a natural grass surface capable of growing inside the dome was developed and installed by a team from [[Michigan State University]].&lt;ref name="turf"&gt;{{cite web| title=Silverdome, site of MSU turf triumph, closing| url=http://www.landscapemanagement.net/athletic-turf-content/news/silverdome-site-msu-turf-triumph-closing-7305| publisher=Landscape Management| work=Athletic Turf News| date=February 16, 2006| first=Ron| last=Hall| access-date=January 23, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This grass surface was laid upon wooden pallets atop the artificial turf that is usually used.

On March 29, 1987, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]'s [[WrestleMania III]] established the record for attendance of 93,173, the largest recorded attendance for a live indoor sporting event in North America.&lt;ref name="slam"&gt;{{cite web| date=March 29, 1987| url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html| title=Steamboat – Savage rule WrestleMania 3|last=Powell| first=John| publisher=SLAM!

The Silverdome hosted an [[AMA Supercross Championship]] round from 1976 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.amasupercross.com/MediaGuide/SXMediaGuide_15_lores.pdf| title=2015 AMA Supercross media guide| publisher=American Motorcyclist Association| year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Silverdome became the home stadium of the city's professional Ultimate Frisbee team, the [[Detroit Mechanix]], of the [[American Ultimate Disc League]].&lt;ref name="Detroit Mechanix"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://detmechanix.com/events/venue/| title=Detroit Mechanix| publisher=Detroit Mechanix| date=June 6, 2012| access-date=June 6, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613195655/http://detmechanix.com/events/venue/| archive-date=2012-06-13| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the Silverdome hosted the AUDL championship game, as on August 11, the Philadelphia Spinners defeated the Indianapolis AlleyCats 29-22.

After the roof had been collapsed and the stadium abandoned, [[Red Bull]] produced a video of [[Freestyle BMX|BMX]] rider Tyler Fernengel riding inside the Silverdome in 2015. Some notable tricks in the video were Fernengel's barspin to double peg to 180° spin on one of the handrails inside the stadium and an impressive "truckdriver" (handlebars spinning 360° while the bike frame spins 360°) out of the luxury boxes onto a ramp that led down to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pro BMX rider Tyler Fernengel bikes through abandoned Silverdome |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/detroit-lions/post/_/id/17545/pro-bmx-rider-tyler-fernengel-bikes-through-silverdome |work=ESPN.com |author=Rothstein, Michael |date=June 9, 2015 |access-date=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, a [[drag racing]] event at the former parking lot marked the beginning of [[Woodward Dream Cruise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoaklandpress.com/general-news/20150812/roadkill-nights-draws-thousands-of-fans-hundreds-of-cars-to-silverdome Roadkill Nights draws thousands of fans, hundreds of cars to Silverdome]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Conception/development===
The idea of a major sports complex was part of a dream of C. Don Davidson, a [[Pontiac, Michigan]] native and star high school athlete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silverdome-architect.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-visionary-behind-it.html |title=PONTIAC SILVERDOME&amp;nbsp;... INCEPTION - HISTORY - FACTS - PAST EVENTS: A Vision for a Stadium - The Visionary Who Conceived It and Helped Make It a Reality |publisher=Silverdome-architect.blogspot.com |date=May 24, 1968 |access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson, upon graduating from [[Pontiac Central High School]] in 1947 and completing active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps, attended [[North Carolina State University]] on a football scholarship.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{cite web| title=C. Don Davidson 1929-1987| url=http://silverdome-architect.blogspot.com/| publisher=blogspot.com| date=January 2012| access-date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After earning a master's degree in urban planning and architecture, Davidson began his career as an architect and was recognized for several government and city projects throughout the south including Florida's [[Jacksonville International Airport]].  He returned to Pontiac in 1965 and was shocked to see the deterioration of the city of Pontiac and its lack of a future plan. Davidson embarked upon what would eventually become an obsession for him to see his beloved city succeed. In 1965-66, he was hired as a professor of architecture and urban planning at the [[University of Detroit Mercy|University of Detroit]] under the direction of Bruno Leon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://research.udmercy.edu/find/special_collections/digital/honors/item.php?record_id=545&amp;collectionCode=honors_hon |title=Leon, Bruno - University Honors |publisher=Research.udmercy.edu |date= |access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of an ongoing, comprehensive study by his architecture class on urban renewal for the city of Pontiac, Davidson met with various city and state authorities including [[William Clay Ford, Sr.|William Clay Ford]], owner of the Detroit Lions, to discuss the possibility of a new stadium, made it a college class project to find a suitable site for a new stadium and even started his own weekly newspaper known as ''The Pontiac Times'',&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt; to help promote his vision. After much controversy and sparring with Detroit city officials, Pontiac was chosen over several other sites including the Michigan Fairgrounds, Walled Lake and the Detroit Riverfront as the best place for construction of what would become known as the Pontiac Silverdome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Kearns| first=Bruno| title=Pontiac Best Site for Metro Stadium?| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1978&amp;dat=19690211&amp;id=1AYuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z6sFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1448,4178712| newspaper=The Owosso Argus-Press| date=February 11, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Pontiac Will Get Lion's Stadium Backing – Ford| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1978&amp;dat=19710201&amp;id=3zUiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HKsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=960,3019530| newspaper=The Owosso Argus-Press| date=February 1, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already having a stadium concept as part of his master plan for the city, Davidson was interviewed and ultimately hired as chief project designer for the stadium project by the architectural firm of O'Dell, Hewlett &amp; Luckenbach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silverdome-architect.blogspot.com/2013/02/notable-people-who-advocated-for.html |title=PONTIAC SILVERDOME ...

It contained 102 luxury suites and 7,384 club seats.

===Original silver-like roof===
The original silver-like roof was built of Teflon-coated fiberglass panels, and [[Air-supported structure|supported by air pressure]] inside the stadium. Although the roof has always been white in color as viewed with the naked eye, the stadium obtained the name "Silverdome" (which it would officially take on in 1977) due to a silver-like reflection caused by the Sun, mainly noticed from the sky. (Initially, however, the stadium also went by its shortened nickname of ''PonMet'', but that nickname was disliked by Pontiac city commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;http://detroiturbex.com/content/parksandrec/silverdome/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;) The roof was replaced by a new canvas fabric, reinforced by steel girders after a strong snowstorm on March 4, 1985, caused structural damage to the old roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The roof of the Pontiac Silverdome, home of the...| url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/03/04/The-roof-of-the-Pontiac-Silverdome-home-of-the/7866478760400/| agency=[[United Press International]]| date=March 4, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the damage, the Detroit Pistons played the remainder of the [[1984–85 NBA season|1984–85 season]] at the now-closed [[Joe Louis Arena]].&lt;ref name="pistons"&gt;{{cite web| title=Detroit Pistons 1980s| url=http://www.nba.com/pistons/history/1980s.html| publisher=NBA.com| access-date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The accident, and the delay in repairs, partially prompted the Pistons moving three seasons later {{convert|4|mi|0}} north to their new, privately owned, 20,000-seat sports arena, [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]] (like Joe Louis Arena, it also has since closed down).

The 1985 repairs were necessitated by a collapse of the original 1975 roof around noon EST on March 4, 1985. Heavy, wet snow accumulated on the southwest corner of the dome and depressed the fabric panels low enough so that the fabric came in contact with a steel lighting catwalk that was positioned just below the inner lip of the roof's ring beam. The hole caused a loss of air pressure and the Dome deflated slowly – there were no injuries. The shift from a "dome" to "bowl" caused all the heavy, wet snow to slide down into the bowl and rupture more roof panels, collapse some precast risers in the SW upper deck, and dislodge more plastic seats "...&amp;nbsp;than a Rolling Stones concert" according to Bob Haney, the Dome's Operations Manager. Crews from Owens-Corning Fiberglas, the dome's original roof installer, were on site by 1:30&amp;nbsp;pm on March 4. Repair operations began immediately but were interrupted for over a week due to high winds. During the high winds event nearly all of the remaining panels in the deflated roof, 100 in all, were badly damaged. The decision was made to replace the entire roof and incorporate some improvements to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. Repair cost of the roof was just under $8 million.

The repairs were completed and the dome re-inflated at noon on May 28, 1985. A thunderstorm passed through the Pontiac area the morning the Dome was to be re-inflated and a partial inflation, or "puff", was performed so that the scheduled inflation could occur in the presence of the many city and area politicians as well as number corporate executives. The original-style, Teflon-coated fiberglass material was used to make the repairs – not canvas as described in the article. There were several snow-melting and waterproofing improvements that kept the dome inflated until January 2, 2013 – almost 28 years.

===Notable audience attendance numbers===
The largest crowd to ever gather at the Silverdome was on September 18, 1987 for [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] with [[Pope John Paul II]], with a reported attendance of 93,682&amp;nbsp;— just shading the record of 93,173 set at the Silverdome on March 29, 1987 for [[WrestleMania III]]. Another notable audience attendance record had earlier been broken on April 30, 1977, when the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] played in front of 76,229 fans at the Silverdome. This was, at the time, a new world record attendance for a solo indoor attraction, beating the 75,962 that [[The Who]] attracted there on December 6, 1975.&lt;ref name="go"&gt;{{cite web| title=Pontiac Silverdome| url=http://www.gotickets.com/venues/mi/pontiac_silverdome.php| publisher=GoTickets.com| access-date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Detroit Pistons]] also set numerous NBA attendance records during their time at the Silverdome; Regular Season, 61,983 vs. Boston, January 29, 1988; Playoffs, 41,732, vs. L.A. Lakers, June 16, 1988.&lt;ref name="attendance"&gt;{{cite web| title=Attendance Records| url=http://www.nba.com/pistons/history/attendance_records.html| publisher=NBA.com| access-date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marching band activities and events===
The Silverdome was also the home to many marching band activities and events, including the [[Michigan Competing Band Association]] State Marching Band Championships until 2005, the [[Bands of America]] Regional championships from 2003 to 2005, and the Bands of America Grand National Championships in 1987 and 1988. Following its reopening, the Silverdome was host to the 2010, 2011 and 2012 [[Bands of America]] Pontiac Regional Championship.&lt;ref name="music"&gt;{{cite web| title=Pontiac, MI - October 9, 2010| url=http://www.musicforall.org/resources/fall-results/2010/pontiac-mi| publisher=Music For All| date=September 16, 2010| access-date=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage after Lions' move to Ford Field===
The Lions moved to [[Ford Field]] at the beginning of the [[2002 NFL season]]. When the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) tried to re-introduce itself, the [[World Hockey Association (proposed)|new WHA]] Detroit team was slated to play its home games at the Silverdome. Plans were also mooted for a [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]]-based [[Canadian Football League]] team which could have used the dome for possible playoff games, but that team also did not materialize.

After the Lions relocated, activity in the Silverdome dropped drastically; however, it still staged some events. Annually, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] used the Silverdome from the late 1970s to 2004. Due to talk of renovation in 2004, the Witnesses opted to travel to The [[Dow Event Center]] in [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]], and the [[SeaGate Convention Centre]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]] for their District Conventions.&lt;ref name="witnesses"&gt;{{cite news| title=Third weekend of Jehovah's Witnesses convention in Saginaw adds $1 million more to local economy, experts say| url=http://www.mlive.com/living/saginaw/index.ssf/2009/07/third_weekend_of_jehovahs_witn.html| author=Michael Wayland| date=July 31, 2009| work=[[Advance Publications|MLive.com]]| access-date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2003 and 2006, a three-screen [[drive-in theater]] operated in the parking lot; this theater reopened in 2010 before closing again on July 13, 2011.&lt;ref name="drivein"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/19396| title=Silverdome Drive-In| publisher=Cinema Treasures| access-date=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Silverdome hosted [[Monster Jam]] on January 7, 2006, and was used as a practice facility for the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] champion [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] for [[Super Bowl XL]], with the NFL adding [[FieldTurf]], which was later donated to a local high school.

===Sale===
After the Lions' departure, the city of Pontiac began to experience several years of serious financial problems.  Due to the continued high maintenance costs of the structure, it made several unsuccessful attempts to sell the stadium.&lt;ref name="metrotimes"&gt;{{cite news| title=Dome Sweet Dome| url=http://www2.metrotimes.com/news/story.asp?id=14376| author=Sandra Svoboda| date=September 16, 2009| work=[[Metro Times]]| access-date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Judge approves injunction to stop sale of Pontiac Silverdome| url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20091118/FREE/911189991/judge-approves-injunction-to-stop-sale-of-pontiac-silverdome| date=November 18, 2009| work=[[Crain Communications|Crain's Detroit Business]]| first=Daniel| last=Duggan| access-date=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 2008, United Assurance Company Ltd. made the highest purchase offer to date, with a bid of $18 million to convert the Silverdome into a Hollywood-style entertainment complex, following an earlier bid of $12 million by an attorney.&lt;ref name=DNSBPEV&gt;{{cite news| title=Newest Silverdome Bidder Hopes To Bring Sports Back To Stadium| work=[[The Detroit News]]| date=February 20, 2008| url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2008/02/Issue-105/Facilities-Venues/Newest-Silverdome-Bidder-Hopes-To-Bring-Sports-Back-To-Stadium.aspx| publisher=Sports Business Daily| access-date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the city announced in October 2009 that the property would go to auction with no minimum bid, and that zoning regulations would be relaxed for any buyer in order to spark development.  The city engaged the firm of Williams &amp; Williams to conduct the auction in November 2009.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news| title=Place Your Bids: Silverdome Goes on the Block| url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/10/07/news/economy/silverdome_auction/index.htm| date=October 7, 2009| first=Aaron| last=Smith| work=CNNMoney.com| access-date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reading about the auction in a newspaper, Greek-born Canadian real estate developer [[Andreas Apostolopoulos]], CEO of Toronto-based Triple Properties Inc., submitted a winning bid of US$550,000.  Real estate fees of 6% raised the price to US$583,000.&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite news| title=Toronto developer acquires Pontiac Silverdome| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/toronto-developer-acquires-pontiac-silverdome/article1374848/| author=Steve Ladurantaye| work=[[The Globe and Mail]]| location=[[Toronto]]| date=November 23, 2009| access-date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sale of the Silverdome, completed in 1975 at a cost of $55.7 million (approx. $225 million in 2012 dollars) and sold in 2009 for $583,000, was viewed by many as a symbol of the collapse of [[real estate prices]] in the [[Detroit metropolitan area]] though many local leaders and residents claimed the sale was brought about due to the incompetence of city management and their not having a vision or future plans for the stadium and surrounding area.&lt;ref name="daily"&gt;{{cite news| title=Detroit Stadium or New York Studio?

===Reopening (2010–2013)===
In the March 11, 2010, edition of the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', Apostolopoulos vowed "to revive the stadium as a big-event venue by investing millions of dollars".&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{cite news| title=New owner's vision for Pontiac Silverdome: Big Events| url=http://www.freep.com/article/20100311/COL06/3110462/Vision-for-the-Silverdome/| first=Tom| last=Walsh| date=March 11, 2010| work=Detroit Free Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117172326/http://www.freep.com/article/20100311/COL06/3110462/Vision-for-the-Silverdome/|archivedate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Silverdome re-opened on April 17, 2010, with a [[monster truck]] event.&lt;ref name="csm" /&gt;

[[A.C. Milan]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] played an [[exhibition game]] on August 6, 2010.&lt;ref name="lalas"&gt;{{cite web| title=Commentary: Milan-Panathinaikos has real meaning in Detroit| url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/commentary-milan-panathinaikos-has-real-meaning-detroit| first=Greg| last=Lalas| date=August 4, 2010| publisher=Major League Soccer| access-date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 2011, [[professional boxing|professional boxer]] [[Timothy Bradley]] defended his [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[list of light-welterweight boxing champions|light welterweight title]] in a unification fight against [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion [[Devon Alexander]]. The fight aired live on ''[[HBO World Championship Boxing]]'', with an attendance of about 7,000.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
The owners indicated that they were pursuing a possible expansion team for [[Major League Soccer]], and contemplated renovating the Silverdome for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2011/06/08/Franchises/MLS-Detroit.aspx |title=Silverdome Owners Submit Application To MLS In Hopes Of Landing Franchise |publisher=[[Advance Publications|SportsBusiness Daily]] |date=June 8, 2011 |access-date=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the lack of events coming into the stadium, combined with the 2013 roof collapse, put any further development plans on indefinite hold.

===Auctioning of contents and demolition===
In March 2014, the owners announced that they would be auctioning off the contents of the facility, including seats and fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/general-news/20140320/no-word-on-future-of-pontiac-silverdome-after-auction-of-seats-equipment| title=No word on future of Pontiac Silverdome after auction of seats, equipment| first=Dustin| last=Blitchok| work=The Oakland Press| date=March 20, 2014| access-date=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, in October 2015, it was announced that the Silverdome would be demolished in the Spring of 2016, and the area would be part of an [[Oakland County, Michigan]] [[mixed-use development]].  Demolition was then scheduled for December 3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoaklandpress.com/general-news/20151029/silverdome-to-be-demolished-prior-to-redevelopment-pontiac-site-to-be-featured-in-county-showcase Silverdome to be demolished prior to redevelopment, Pontiac site to be featured in county showcase]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, fire caused by arson destroyed the former press box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/general-news/20160610/officials-fire-at-pontiac-silverdome-was-arson |title=Officials: Fire at Pontiac Silverdome was arson |publisher=Theoaklandpress.com |date=June 13, 2016 |access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parking lot is being used as storage for hundreds&lt;!--thousands--&gt; of [[Volkswagen emissions scandal|VW diesel cars]] as a result of Volkswagen's 2015 emissions scandal.

In 2017, the Silverdome was condemned and cleared for demolition. Workers had been on the site for the past few months before main power feeds were disconnected preparing the Silverdome for demolition, including completing environmental remediation, universal waste removal and tearing out transite asbestos panels that were used in a majority of the suites around the perimeter of the dome; though not without a few local trespasser visits to explore the place leading up to the demolition. On September 18 and 19, 2017, four power feeds were disconnected, officially starting the final preparation process for demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/general-news/20170914/with-power-off-silverdome-demo-can-kick-off|title=With power off, Silverdome demo can kick-off|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm contracted to handle the demolition, the Detroit-based Adamo Group, also imploded the [[Georgia Dome]] in [[Atlanta]] on November 20 before moving on to the Silverdome. The demolition of the Silverdome was to commence on December 3, 2017 with a partial implosion of the upper deck, followed by an excavation of the building from the inside out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reindl|first1=JC|title=Explosion to kick off Pontiac Silverdome demolition|url=http://www.freep.com/story/money/2017/10/13/pontiac-silverdome-demolition/763550001/|website=Detroit Free Press|access-date=November 4, 2017|language=en|date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pontiac Silverdome To Be Demolished In December|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2017/11/03/pontiac-silverdome-to-be-demolished-in-december/|access-date=November 4, 2017|work=CBS Detroit|date=November 3, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a wiring issue, eight of the explosive charges failed to detonate, preventing the stadium from imploding as planned. A second attempt was successful the next day. While Adamo could not pinpoint the exact cause of the issues, they did note that trespassers had been seen on the property a couple of days prior to the first attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wxyz.com/news/watch-crews-successfully-implode-the-pontiac-silverdome|title=WATCH: Crews successfully implode the Pontiac Silverdome|last=White|first=Max|date=2017-12-05|work=WXYZ|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2017/12/03/pontiac-silverdome-demolition-explosion/915924001/|title=Demolition executive says wiring to blame in failed Pontiac Silverdome implosion|work=Detroit Free Press|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2017/12/silverdome_imploded.html|title=Silverdome isn't going quietly after withstanding demolition charges|work=MLive.com|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2017/12/04/pontiac-silverdome-implosion-retry/920791001/|title=Success!

By the end of March 2018, the last free standing wall of the Silverdome was felled, leaving a {{convert|50|foot|m|0}} deep hole where the stadium once stood. {{convert|55000|yd3|m3|-1}} of crushed concrete will remain on site to be used as landfill material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2252">'''Ralph E. Davis Pioneer Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Platteville, Wisconsin]].  It is used for collegiate and high school [[American football]] and collegiate [[soccer]], and is the home field of the [[University of Wisconsin–Platteville]] "Pioneers".  

Pioneer Stadium opened in 1972 and holds 10,000 people.&lt;ref name="stadium" /&gt;  It is the second largest stadium in [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] collegiate football,&lt;ref name="stadium" /&gt; and the largest soccer stadium.  From 1984-2001, the stadium and other university facilities were also used as the [[Chicago Bears]]' [[NFL Training Camp|training camp]] home.&lt;ref name="donation" /&gt;  

The stadium is named for Ralph Emerson Davis,&lt;ref name="stadium" /&gt; a geologist and "godfather of the natural gas industry," who served as the Director of the Wisconsin Mining School, which would eventually merge to for the [[University of Wisconsin–Platteville]]. Davis's generous donation helped complete the $1.25 million facility. 

In 2005, stadium renovations included replacing the grass surface with a Pro-Grass in-fill surface.&lt;ref name="stadium"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ralph E. Davis Pioneer Stadium|url=http://athletics.uwplatt.edu/facilities/Pioneer-Stadium|website=University of Wisconsin-Platteville Athletics|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2014, the stadium was damaged by a [[tornado]].&lt;ref name="donation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erickson|first1=Paul|title=Chicago Bears to donate $50,000 to tornado relief|url=https://www.uwplatt.edu/news/chicago-bears-donate-50000-tornado-relief|website=University of Wisconsin-Platteville|accessdate=11 April 2016|date=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Signs of the Time''''' is a 60-minute American [[documentary film]] on the origin of hand signals in [[baseball]]. There are several myths in regard to how signals were started, and the film addresses some of the mysteries that led to umpires giving hand-signals to call plays in the field, base coaches to relay hand signals to players on the field, and catchers to relay hand signals to pitchers.

==Plot==
Baseball of the 19th century was America's most popular spectator sport. Professional teams like the 1889 [[Brooklyn Bridegrooms]] drew nearly a half a million fans per season. Thousands of fans attended some of the earliest known games, but without the benefit of the signals on the diamond to tell them what was happening on the field. There were no signals for strike, safe, out or foul and no announcer to interpret the game. Prior to the invention of baseball signs, the only signal was the umpire's voice, often drowned out by the roar of thousands of excited fans. ''Signs of the Time'' explores the origins of this innovation and the baseball pioneers that changed the course of the game and history.

Several have laid claim to the signs and signals that have influenced America's game but only two deserve consideration. The first is [[Bill Klem]], the most significant [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] of the last century and the first to be inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]. He spent nearly forty years in professional baseball from 1905 to 1942, influencing many of the greatest legends of the game. He was well known for his authoritative style behind the plate and his boastful demeanor in public.

The second man was [[Dummy Hoy|William "Dummy" Hoy]], who since the age of two, was profoundly [[deaf]] and unable to speak. Hoy was drafted by the professional [[Oshkosh Baseball Club]] in 1886. Through his career from 1886–1903, Hoy was admired by his teammates, revered by the fans, and became the most celebrated deaf player in the history of big-league baseball.

Both of these men made significant contributions to the game and each has laid claim to the signs of baseball. ''Signs of the Time'' exposes the myths and mysteries of the game with anecdotes of the past, depictions of early baseball and interviews with the most influential names of the game.

==Release==
A private cast, crew and media screening was held on August 23, 2008 at the [[George Eastman House]] in Rochester, New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/200808130300/SPORTS/808130326]&lt;/ref&gt;

The public film release was in Fall 2008.

During the 1989 RAAM, the team used the hi-tech prototype [[cyclocomputer]] called the "Power Pacer"&lt;ref name="powerpacer"&gt;[http://www.trainingsmartonline.com/power_cycling_training.php Training Smart] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516181431/http://www.trainingsmartonline.com/power_cycling_training.php |date=2009-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; designed by Balboa Instruments. The device measured each rider's individual performance (for the total 2911 miles) in terms of power output (in watts) and calories burned through an output device built into the rear wheel hub.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventurecorps.com/when/raam/1989raam.html Chris Kostman]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheldonbrown.com/rinard/aero/measuring.htm Rainer Pivit]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/bitstream/1892/6018/1/b14308745.pdf Leonard W. Brownlie]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Team members ==
The four-man team was led by Ultra Marathon cyclist Alan McDonald (team captain).
The four riders were:&lt;ref name="RAA"&gt;[http://www.raceacrossamerica.org Race Across America]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alan MacDonald of Huntington Beach, California
* Mike Haluza of Irvine, California
* Greg Ewing of Corona Del Mar, California
* John Harvey of [[Auckland]], New Zealand

The team's support crew was led by Crew Chief Karen Anderson, a RAAM veteran.  Designer of the Power Pacer and mechanical engineer for Balboa Instruments, Steve Smith was heavily involved with the team performing data acquisition from the Power Pacer units. Smith also joined the support crew for the cross-county race. The team also had a masseuse, a mechanic and a sports physiologist.

===After RAAM===
Team Strawberry was formed for the sole purpose of testing the Power Pacer in competition and to compete in the Race Across America. After RAAM, the team disbanded and did not compete together again.

== Team name ==
The team's name originated from an earlier race in which Alan McDonald was dubbed "The Strawberry Kid", when he and his support crew, during a race, paused to track down a group of drunk drivers in the mountain town of [[Strawberry, Arizona]]. McDonald contacted the authorities and had to wait for police to arrive before continuing in the competition. Consequently, McDonald lost his place in the race. News of this brief encounter spread and race officials dubbed McDonald as ''"The Strawberry Kid"''. Since McDonald organized the RAAM '89 team, team members elected to continue the use of the "Strawberry" name.

== Human Powered Vehicle Race Across America ==
Team Strawberry competed in the Race Across America as the next level of testing for the prototype "Power Pacer" [[Cycling power meter]]. The cross-country HPV ([[Human Powered Vehicle]]) RAAM was designed to be a platform for technology advancement in cycling aerodynamics and human powered propulsion, so it was logical to use the race as a testing ground. The race was basically a transcontinental four-man [[individual time trial]] relay race in which riders could rotate as often as they felt was necessary to maintain the highest possible average speed. All teams started together but finished many hours apart by the end of the 2,911 mile sprint. Today, team members can ride together to take advantage of drafting whereas in the 1989 race there could only be one rider at a time. In the 1989 race, riders would take turns, each person riding as fast as possible until his [[average speed]] began to decay, marking the logical time to switch riders. Today's drafting allowance has enabled faster average speeds in the team divisions. The data acquired each rider's individual power output and [[calorie]] expenditure, as well as the overall total as a team.

== Vehicles ==
* The basic concept was that anything goes as far as the type of vehicle, as long as it was both bicycle based, and  100% pedal power propelled by human force with no artificial assist except for aerodynamic aids.
* Teams could make minor modifications as long as the over-all design remained the same from start to finish.
* Emphasis was on the bike design rather than the rider. Team Strawberry opted for the lighter and more reliable [[upright bicycle]]&lt;ref name="advent"/&gt; with a simple handlebar-mounted fairing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zzipper.com Handlebar-mounted fairings]&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed third place in the 1989 race, crossing the country in just over six days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raceacrossamerica.org/subwebraam/history/rec1989.htm 1989 Race Across America results] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224154406/http://www.raceacrossamerica.org/subwebraam/history/rec1989.htm |date=2008-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teams to continue in RAAM ==

Notably, Team Strawberry made significant contributions to the sport of bicycle racing. Their participation in cyclist power measurement paved the way for further advancement in the technology. Furthermore, their participation along with the other teams entered in the 1989 [[Race Across America]] changed the structure of the race by opening the door to further team competition in a race that was designed to be a solo competitor event. This marked the beginning of team competition in the annual race and today, along with the solo category, team categories have been expanded considerably. Teams can be 2 or 4 members. Corporate teams can be larger.

== Teams: best times ==
1989 RACE ACROSS AMERICA, HPV DIVISION (4-man teams):&lt;ref name="RAA"/&gt;
# Team Lightning/recumbent bike,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightningbikes.com/team.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; fully enclosed HPV... 5: 01: 08 / 24.02&amp;nbsp;mph average. (James Penseyres, [[Pete Penseyres]], Michael Coles, Bob Fourney)&lt;ref name="RAA"/&gt;
# Team Chronos/standard bike + Fairing with integrated body wrap... 6: 07: 40 / 19.20&amp;nbsp;mph average. (Thane Hall, Randall Olsen, Brian Spence, Paul Anderson)&lt;ref name="RAA"/&gt;
# Team Strawberry/standard bike + Fairing only 6: 14: 03 / 18.41&amp;nbsp;mph average. (Alan McDonald, John Harvey, Greg Ewing, Mike Haluza)&lt;ref name="RAA"/&gt;

== Devices: Power Pacer, Power Tap, SRM, Polar S-170 and Max One ==
The team was sponsored by Power Pacer, a human power measurement device that consisted of a rear-wheel hub, a frame mounted sensor and a handlebar mounted processor. McDonald struck a sponsorship deal with Balboa Instruments, maker of the device, whereby the team would test the product during the company's product research and development. As a condition of the sponsorship agreement, McDonald agreed to have the team use the equipment during the actual cross-country race which limited the team to spoked wheels rather than the faster and more efficient [[Time trial bicycle]] setup with Disk Wheels as used by the other teams. This hurt Team Strawberry in the competition by reducing their average speed, but the sacrifice contributed to the advancement of the technology.

Balboa Instruments released the Power Pacer hub shortly after Look’s Max One.&lt;ref name="powerpacer"/&gt; Neither one of these early devices was a marketing success due to their high cost and complexity. Power-based training had been possible in labs only with special [[Exercise machine|ergometers]] mounted to stationary bikes until 1988 when Balboa Instruments and several other companies began to develop the technology for "on-the-road" use. Another system, the SRM, actually started the concept of measuring rider output on the road.  It was shortly followed by the Power Pacer (Balboa Instruments) and LOOK Max One hubs.  The SRM enjoyed greater publicity when it was embraced by international cycling federations, as well as world-famous [[Tour de France]] winner [[Greg LeMond]]. The research on cyclist power measuring devices performed by Team Strawberry and Balboa Instruments started the trend that resulted in the more affordable Power Tap (1998, Tune Corp., purchased by Graber Products in late 2000) and Polar S-710 (2001).

'''Verdes FC''' (''previously '''Hankook Verdes''''') is a Belizean association football club which competes in the Belize Premier Football League. They are based in  [[Benque Viejo del Carmen]], a town situated on the border of [[Guatemala]]. The club was established in 1976 as '''Real Verdes Football Club''' and changed their name to Hankook Verdes in 2004. The club is one of the oldest active professional football teams in Belize and has been in existence since the inception of the [[Football Federation of Belize]]. Their home games are played at [[Marshalleck Stadium]].

The club has established an excellent reputation for the development of many past and current members of the [[Belize national football team]], despite not having won any club championships at the national level until 2008.

In 1985, Hankook Verdes was the first team to represent [[Belize]] in the [[CONCACAF Champions' Cup]].  Throughout the history of Belizean football, Real Verdes has represented its country more than any other club in Belize. The list of [[CONCACAF]] opponents includes professional teams such as [[Cruz Azul]], [[Club Universidad Nacional|UNAM]], [[Santos Laguna]], [[Querétaro F.C.|Querétaro]] ([[Mexico]]); [[Real C.D. España|Real España]], [[Platense F.C.|Platense]], [[Pumas UNAH]] ([[Honduras]]); [[Club Xelajú MC|Xelajú]], [[C.S.D. Municipal|Municipal]], [[C.S.D.
