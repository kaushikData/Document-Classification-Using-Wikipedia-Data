{{Anthropology}}
'''''American Anthropologist''''' is the flagship journal of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA), published quarterly by [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]]. The "New Series" began in 1899 under an editorial board that included [[Franz Boas]], [[Daniel G. Brinton]], and [[John Wesley Powell]]. The current editor-in-chief is Deborah A. Thomas (University of Pennsylvania).&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Michele W. (January&amp;nbsp;6, 2016).

==Four-field approach==
The four main subfields of anthropology include cultural, linguistic, archeology, and biological/physical. Sometimes applied anthropology and public anthropology are added as additional subfields.

Among the journals published by the AAA, ''American Anthropologist'' is the only one that follows the "four-field" approach, publishing articles from the four main subfields of anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Segal ''et al.'' 2005, Introduction, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the four-field approach see ''American Anthropologist'''s broad scope as important to maintaining disciplinary unity, while critics have expressed serious reservations about this aim, and criticize pressures since the 1970s against editors and works that do not subscribe to four-field holism as an ideal for anthropological scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Segal ''et al.'' 2005, Introduction, pp.7, 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, then editor-in-chief [[Tom Boellstorff]] proposed that ''American Anthropologist'' be viewed as an “interdisciplinary” journal, arguing that the goal should be "to present the best work in 'anthropology'—as defined in the broadest possible sense. That certainly includes work that speaks across subdisciplines in some manner, often by integrating methods, problematics, and relevant literatures from more than one subfield. However, it also includes work that is not invested in the four-field concept and presents itself as, say, cultural anthropology or archaeology, with no reference to a four-field vision of 'the discipline.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boellstorff|first=Tom|date=2010-06-01|title=Field Work|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01216.x/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=112|issue=2|pages=177–179|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01216.x|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6502">'''Amice Calverley''' (9 April 1896 – 10 April 1959) was an English-born Canadian [[Egyptologist]] who was instrumental to the recording and publication of the decoration in the temple of [[Seti I|King Sethos I]] at Abydos.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt; During and after World War II she engaged in humanitarian work, including in Crete where she nursed at the front and filmed the conflict.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt; She then used her filming as publicity to seek assistance for those disabled as a result of the conflict.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt;

==Early life==

Amice Mary Calverley was born in London on 9 April 1896. Her family first moved to South Africa, then on to Canada.&lt;ref name="Breaking Ground"&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archaeology|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/results.php?d=1&amp;first=Amice%20Mary&amp;last=Caverley|publisher=Brown University}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied music and earned some money from her needlework, before going to New York where she worked as a mannequin and dress-designer at Wanamaker's Store.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Amice Mary Calverley|last=Gover|first=Janet Leveson|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|year=1959|volume=45|pages=85–87|jstor=3855467}}&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining a scholarship in 1922 to study at the Royal College of Music she returned to England.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt;

In 1926 she started to teach herself drawing for archaeology, during which process she upset a bottle of ink over an 'immemorial sherd' at the [[British Museum]], and became involved with the Egyptian Exploration Society in 1927.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt;

==Achievements in Egyptology==

In 1928, Amice Calverley was engaged by the Society to work as part of a project to record the decoration in the temple of [[Seti I|King Sethos I]] at Abydos.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt;

[[File:AbydosSetiChapelRelief145.jpg|thumb|alt= Example of a relief in Temple Chapel of Osiris, Temple of Seti I, Abydos, Egypt|Example of a relief in Temple Chapel of Osiris, Temple of Seti I, Abydos, Egypt]]

Although the project was initially conceived as a "purely photographic publication", the quality of Calverley's draughtsmanship was instrumental in allowing a more ambitious publication to be realised.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt; This was because the high standards Calverley attained in portraying the sculptures in the temple meant that it would look incongruous to simply put her drawings with schematic representations of the hieroglyphic inscriptions, and the project evolved into a more ambitious scheme - which would also require more time.&lt;ref name="Egypt Exploration Society"&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt Exploration Society|url=http://www.ees.ac.uk/news/index/42.html|accessdate=19 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020210607/http://www.ees.ac.uk/news/index/42.html|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the winter of 1928-9, Calverley was working singlehandedly to draw and photograph the reliefs when John D. Rockefeller Jr. visited.&lt;ref name="Breaking Ground"/&gt; He was so impressed by her work and by the temple reliefs that he co-sponsored the project with the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Breaking Ground" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Egypt Exploration Society"/&gt;

The resulting work was published in four volumes:

* Sethos 1. The Temple of King Sethos I at Abydos, Volume I: The Chapels of Osiris, Isis and Horus   Copied by Amice M. Calverley, with the assistance of Myrtle F. Broome, and edited by Alan H. Gardiner
* Sethos 2. The Temple of King Sethos I at Abydos, Volume II: The Chapels of Amen-Re', Re'-Harakhti, Ptah, and King Sethos   Copied by Amice M. Calverley, with the assistance of Myrtle F. Broome, and edited by Alan H. Gardiner
* Sethos 3. The Temple of King Sethos I at Abydos, Volume III: The Osiris Complex   Copied by Amice M. Calverley, with the assistance of Myrtle F. Broome, and edited by Alan H. Gardiner
* Sethos 4. The Temple of King Sethos I at Abydos, Volume IV: The Second Hypostyle Hall   Copied by Amice M. Calverley, with the assistance of Myrtle F. Broome, and edited by Alan H. Gardiner

The photographic archive produced by Calverley became an irreplaceable resource for studying the temple, and was used by the Egypt Exploration Society in its further work on the temple in 1979-1983.&lt;ref name="JEA 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baines|first=John|title=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 1984|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|year=1984|volume=70|pages=13–22|jstor=3821569|doi=10.2307/3821569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After working in Abydos, she went to Austria in 1933, where she wrote a string quartet in F Minor.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt;

== War and post-war humanitarian work ==

When World War II started, she became a driver for the Invalid Children's Aid Association during the evacuation scheme in the UK, before returning to Canada due to family illness.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt; Coming back to England in 1941, she was sent briefly to Cairo by the Ministry of Information to be attached to the propaganda unit of the British Embassy.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt; She returned to the UK and joined the Air Force and in 1944 became Civilian Relief worker, Mediterranean, with U.N.R.R.A.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt;

In 1947 she returned to Abydos, where there was an outbreak of cholera, and obtained vaccines from Chicago to inoculate local villagers and British and US personnel in Upper Egypt.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt; She then went on to Crete in 1949 where she filmed the conflict, including visiting Epirus with the Commando Brigade of Colonel Papageorgopoulos and filming the battle of Grammos.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt; She also nursed soldiers at the front.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt;

She later contacted many of the men she had nursed and, shocked by the lack of after-care, worked out a scheme for training the disabled.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt; In 1950 her film of the conflict was shown at the Central Office of Information, although the funds for the wounded that she hoped it would raise never materialized.&lt;ref name="JEA 1959" /&gt;

Caverley returned to Canada and continued to work on volumes V and VI of the Abydos material before her death on 10 April 1959.&lt;ref name="Breaking Ground"/&gt;

'''Anthro''' is a [[fictional character]] published by [[DC Comics]], presented as the "first boy", a [[Cro-Magnon]] born to [[Neanderthal]] parents. Anthro was created by cartoonist [[Howard Post]]; he first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #74, (Mar 1968).&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Wallace  | first = Dan | author-link =   | contribution = Anthro | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 17  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
After a single ''Showcase'' appearance, Anthro was given his own title, which lasted for 6 issues (1968–69).  All six issues were written and drawn by Post, with [[Wallace Wood]] providing inking for the final issue.

Since the cancellation of his title, he has made minor appearances, most notably in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #2.  Subsequently, Anthro appeared in the 2006 revival of ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (comics)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' and the 2008 miniseries ''[[Final Crisis]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[J. G. Jones]]. Anthro also starred in the first story in ''DC Universe Holiday Special 2010''.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Anthro''' is the first [[Cro-Magnon]] boy born in the [[Stone Age]]. His father, [[Neanderthal]] [[caveman]] Ne-Ahn is the chief of his tribe, his mother a captive member of another tribe. Winning two competing cavegirls as his wives, Cro-Magnon women '''Embra''' and '''Nima''', Anthro begins the [[human]] race, as Embra lives to bear his first child.

''Justice League Europe Annual'' #2 features a version of Anthro. In an alternate time-line, an older [[Silver Sorceress]], lost in time, is rescued from a large creature by Anthro. He exhibits great eagerness, smashing the beast long after it is subdued. A bored cavegirl, seemingly either Embra or Nima, joins the Sorceress in watching Anthro's 'battle'.

Anthro is featured in the graphic novel "[[Doctor Thirteen]]: Architecture &amp; Mortality". Speaking only French, he is soon melted out of a chunk of ice into what seems to be the modern day. He assists the Doctor, [[Infectious Lass]], [[Genius Jones]], Captain Fear and other somewhat heroic characters in a mission to keep their existence relevant. The story ends with his status seemingly threatened by the reader of the novel itself.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

===''Final Crisis''===
{{main|Final Crisis}}
Issue one of ''[[Final Crisis]]'' features an extended introduction involving Anthro, where the [[New God]] [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] appears before the boy and gives him the knowledge and skill to make fire.  This starts a sequence in which Anthro is able to fight off a group of savage raiders (led by [[Vandal Savage]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne'' #1-2 (May–June 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;) with a burning stick.  In the closing pages, Anthro seems to have a vision of Kamandi.  In this depiction, Anthro is much more caveman like in his attire, wearing only a loincloth and a satchel, and carrying stone and wood weapons, while his body looks more like a modern teenager rather than having a Cro-Magnon appearance.  In this issue, he only expresses himself with [[!]] and [[?]] signs, as he is apparently unable to speak, as are the rest of the cavemen characters in the book.

In the final issue of ''Final Crisis'', Anthro appears as an old man, drawing the symbols he saw on Metron's body onto a cave wall. As he finishes drawing he dies peacefully, watched over by [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]], who is lost in time.&lt;ref&gt;"Final Crisis" #7 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The after-effects of Anthro's death on his friends and family is explored in the limited series ''[[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne]]''.

==Alternate versions==
Anthro had a supporting role in the ''[[Booster Gold]]'' series, starting with issue eight. In this story, as in ''Tales of the Unexpected'', Anthro wears a leather jacket that resembles [[Mister Terrific (comics)|Mr. Terrific]]'s, but has Anthro's name on the sleeves instead of "Fair Play." This is an alternate time-line Anthro, who is part of a resistance group against the murderous Maxwell Lord. Fellow members include Green Arrow, Hawkman, Wild Dog and Pantha. During the flight to Lord's headquarters, Anthro is taken out by a mind-controlled Superman.&lt;ref&gt;Booster Gold vol. 2, #7-9 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Final Crisis: Superman Beyond'' #1, Superman moves briefly through Earth-20, where alternate versions of a number of DC Comics older heroes exist as 'The Society of Super-Heroes', a group of 'pulp'-style mystery men led by Doc Fate and including Immortal Man.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis Secret Files #1 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Grant Morrison described it as a '' '1940s retro thing'. ''&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Grant Morrison - {{cite web|url=http://www.weeklycrisis.com/2009/05/grant-morrisons-multiversity-more.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006132117/http://www.weeklycrisis.com/2009/05/grant-morrisons-multiversity-more.html |archivedate=2014-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Multiversity - The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors from the Counter-World'' #1 (2014), it is revealed that Immortal Man of Earth-20 is Anthro, who was exposed to the same meteorite that bestowed Vandal Savage's powers on him. He and Doc Fate's Society of Super-Heroes are Earth-20's last defence from an invasion by their paired evil world, Earth-40, where the militia is led by Vandal Savage and [[Lady Shiva]].

==In other media==
===Television===
* Anthro appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Siege of Starro" Pt. 1. He is shown during a montage showcasing various heroes throughout history where he defeats [[King Kull (DC Comics)|Kru'll]] [[Vandal Savage|the Eternal]] after the villain attacks a group of peaceful cave people.

'''Antillia''' (or '''Antilia''') is a [[phantom island]] that was reputed, during the 15th-century age of exploration, to lie in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], far to the west of [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]. The island also went by the name of '''Isle of Seven Cities''' (''Ilha das Sete Cidades'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Isla de las Siete Ciudades'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).

It originates from an old [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] legend, set during the [[Muslim conquest of Hispania]] c. 714. Seeking to flee from the Muslim conquerors, seven Christian [[Visigothic]] bishops embarked with their flocks on ships and set sail westwards into the Atlantic Ocean, eventually landing on an island (''Antilha'') where they founded seven settlements.

The island makes its first explicit appearance as a large rectangular island in the 1424 [[portolan chart]] of [[Zuane Pizzigano]].  Thereafter, it routinely appeared in most nautical charts of the 15th century. After 1492, when the north [[Atlantic Ocean]] began to be routinely sailed, and became more accurately mapped, depictions of Antillia gradually disappeared.  It nonetheless lent its name to the Spanish [[Antilles]].

The routine appearance of such a large "Antillia" in 15th-century nautical charts has led to speculation that it might represent the [[Americas|American]] landmass,&lt;ref&gt;Cortesão (1970):[http://www.portalbarcosdobrasil.com.br/bitstream/handle/01/822/003458.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y p.12])&lt;/ref&gt; and has fueled many theories of [[pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]].

== Legend ==

Stories of islands in the Atlantic Ocean, legendary and otherwise, have been reported since [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;Beazley (1897-1906, 1899:[https://books.google.com/books?id=1RpzAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.lxxii])&lt;/ref&gt;  Utopian tales of the [[Fortunate Islands]] (or Isles of the Blest) were sung by poets like [[Homer]] and [[Horace]]. [[Plato]] articulated the dystopian legend of [[Atlantis]].  Ancient writers like [[Plutarch]], [[Strabo]], and, more explicitly, [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Ptolemy]], testified to the existence of the [[Canary Island]]s.  The names of some real islands re-emerged as distinct mythical islands with associated legends, e.g. ''capraria'' (the island of goats) and ''canaria'' (the island of dogs) are often found on maps separately from the Canary Islands (e.g. [[Pizzigani brothers]], 1367).

The Middle Ages saw the emergence of [[Christian]] versions of these tales.  Notable among these are the Irish ''[[immram]]a'', such as the immram of [[The Voyage of the Uí Chorra|Uí Corra]], or the sea voyages of the 6th-century Irish missionaries [[Saint Brendan]] and [[Malo (saint)|Saint Malo]].  These are the source for several legendary Atlantic islands such as [[Saint Brendan's Island]] and the Island of Ima.&lt;ref&gt;O'Curry (1861: [https://books.google.com/books?id=x4ABAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA289#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.289ff]); Beazley (1897, vol.1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rToSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA230#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.230ff]); Babcock (1922: Ch. 3)&lt;/ref&gt; The sagas of [[Norsemen|Norse]] seafarers to [[Greenland]] and [[Vinland]], notably the [[Grœnlendinga saga]] and the [[saga of Erik the Red]], have also been influential. Norse encounters with North American [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] seem to have filtered into Irish ''immrama''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fridtjof Nansen]] (1911: vol.2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JoUvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.9])&lt;/ref&gt;

The peoples of the [[Iberian peninsula]], who were closest to the real Atlantic islands of the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], [[Madeira]] and [[Azores]], and whose seafarers and fishermen may have seen and even visited them,&lt;ref&gt;Both [[Plutarch]] (''Life of Sertorius'') and [[Pliny the Elder]] reported that fishermen from Gades ([[Cadiz]]) routinely visited Atlantic islands to the southwest.&lt;/ref&gt; articulated their own tales.  Medieval [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]]ian [[Arab]]s related stories of Atlantic island encounters in the legend (told by [[al-Masudi]]) of the 9th-century navigator [[Khashkhash Ibn Saeed Ibn Aswad|Khashkhash]] of Cordoba&lt;ref&gt;Beazley (1897: vol.1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rToSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA465#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.465])&lt;/ref&gt; and the 12th-century story (told by [[al-Idrisi]]) of the eight  ''Maghurin'' (Wanderers) of Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley (1906: vol. 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=64MYAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA532#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.532]). Cortesão (1970: p.8)&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the tendency of the legends of different seafarers – Greek, Norse, Irish, Arab and Iberian – to cross-fertilize and influence each other,&lt;ref&gt;Nansen (1911: vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JoUvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.54])&lt;/ref&gt; the exact source of some legendary Atlantic islands – such as the mythical islands of [[Brasil (mythical island)|Brasil]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1837) ''Examen critique'', Vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EicSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA216#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.216ff.]; See also Babckock (1922: Ch.4)&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Isle of Mam]]&lt;ref&gt;Babcock (1922: [https://books.google.com/books?id=-vYrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ch.6])&lt;/ref&gt; – are impossible to disentangle.

It is from Christian Iberia that the legend of ''Antillia'' emerged.  According to the legend, in c. 714, during the [[Muslim conquest of Hispania]], seven Christian bishops of  [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic Hispania]], led by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Porto, Portugal|Bishop of Porto]], embarked with their parishioners on ships and set sail westward into the Atlantic Ocean to escape the Arab conquerors. They stumbled upon an island and decided to settle there, burning their ships to permanently sever their link&lt;ref&gt;For this often-emulated [[Trope (literature)|trope]], see ''[[Aeneid]]'' V, influenced by the tradition that [[Alexander the Great]] burned his ships on the Aegean shore and influencing the reference made by [[Francisco Cervantes de Salazar]] in 1546 to [[Hernàn Cortés]] burning his ships on the Mexican coast. The Moorish  commander [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] also ordered his ships to be burned.&lt;/ref&gt; to their now Muslim-dominated former homeland. The bishops erected seven settlements (the "Seven Cities") on the island. In one reading (from [[Grazioso Benincasa]]), the seven cities are named Aira, Antuab, Ansalli, Ansesseli, Ansodi, Ansolli and Con.&lt;ref&gt;Cortesão (1954 (1975): [https://books.google.com/books?id=2PbNS0LHn60C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=RA1-PA140#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.140])&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend, in this form, is told in various places. The principal source is an inscription on [[Martin Behaim]]'s 1492 Nuremberg globe which reads (in English translation):

{{quote|In the year 734 after the birth of Christ, when all Spain was overrun by the miscreants of Africa, this Island of Antillia, called also the Isle of the Seven Cities, was peopled by the Archbishop of Porto with six other bishops, and certain companions, male and female, who fled from Spain with their cattle and property. In the year 1414 a Spanish ship approached very near this Island.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley (1897: vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rToSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.234]). See also Babcock (1922: [https://books.google.com/books?id=-vYrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.72])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Ruysch map, Gruenlant-Antilia.jpg|thumb|200px|Inscription of [[Johannes Ruysch]], 1508. The [[Isle of Demons]] further north may be Antillia's old companion, [[Satanazes]].]]
The legend is also found inscribed in the 1507/08 map of [[Johannes Ruysch]], which reads (in English):
{{quote|This island Antilia was once found by the Portuguese, but now when it is searched, cannot be found.  People found here speak the Hispanic language, and are believed to have fled here in face of a barbarian invasion of Hispania, in the time of King Roderic, the last to govern Hispania in the era of the Goths. There is 1 archbishop here and 6 other bishops, each of whom has his own city; and so it is called the island of seven cities. The people live here in the most Christian manner, replete with all the riches of this century.&lt;ref&gt;Cortesão (1954 (1975): [https://books.google.com/books?id=2PbNS0LHn60C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=RA1-PA127#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.127])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ruysch's inscription is reproduced almost verbatim in the ''Libro'' of Spanish historian [[Pedro de Medina]] (1548).&lt;ref&gt;[[Pedro de Medina]] (1548 (1595 ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=f5qtYd2_1JUC&amp;pg=RA3-PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.119]).  Curiously, Pedro de Medina says the inscription comes from a "very old" nautical map made by "Tolomeo" at the direction of "Papa Urbano". Presumably he means a map based on (rather than by) [[Ptolemy]]. The last pope by that name was [[Pope Urban VI]] (r. 1378-1389). If Medina has not mistaken his popes, and if there was such a map, then that map would contain the oldest reference to Antillia on record.&lt;/ref&gt;  Medina gives the island's dimensions as 87 leagues in length and 28 in width, with "many good ports and rivers", and says it is situated on the [[latitude]] of the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], that sailors have seen it from a distance, but disappears when they approach it.&lt;ref&gt;Medina (p.119)&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjustment to the 714 date and the burning of the ships is due to [[Ferdinand Columbus]] (1539), who also reports an alleged encounter with the islanders by a Portuguese ship in the time of [[Henry the Navigator]] (c. 1430s–1440s).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ferdinand Columbus]], ''Historia del Almirante'' (1539: ch. 8 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEQOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.45]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[António Galvão]] (1563) reports that a 1447 Portuguese ship stumbled on the island, and met its (Portuguese-speaking) inhabitants, who reported they had fled there in the "time of [[Roderic]]" and asked whether the Moors still dominated Hispania.&lt;ref&gt;[[António Galvão]] (1563: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zdMWAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.72])&lt;/ref&gt; More elaborate versions of this story have been told in more modern times.&lt;ref&gt;A rather fancified version of the tale is told in [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson|Higginson]] (1883:[https://books.google.com/books?id=4q1Ylub6RJ0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.93]), who relates that news of the island's existence was first brought to Europe by an eloping pair of lovers who fled the island.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another variant of the tale is told in [[Manuel de Faria e Sousa]] (1628), of Sacaru, a Visigothic governor of [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]]. Besieged by the Muslim armies and finding his situation hopeless, Sacaru negotiated capitulation, and proceeded, with all who wished to follow him, to embark on a fleet for exile in the [[Canary island]]s. Faria e Sousa notes they may not have reached their destination, but may have ended up instead on an Atlantic Ocean island "populated by Portuguese, that has seven cities&amp;nbsp;... which some imagine to be that one which can be seen from [[Madeira]], but when they wish to reach it, disappears".&lt;ref&gt;Faria e Sousa, 1628 (1677 ed.,  https://books.google.com/books?id=b3S-505H8JsC&amp;pg=PA136#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.129-30)&lt;/ref&gt;

The island is mentioned in a royal letter of King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] (dated 10 November 1475), where he grants the knight Fernão Teles "the Seven Cities and any other populated islands" he might find in the western Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Cortesão (1954 (1975) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2PbNS0LHn60C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=RA1-PA124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 124-5]). A similar grant might have been made earlier in 1473 to Infanta D. Brites, of "an island, that appeared beyond the island of Santiago", but was not found when it was sought. ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is mentioned again in a royal letter (dated 24 July 1486), issued by King [[John II of Portugal]] at the request of Fernão Dulmo authorizing him to search for and "discover the island of Seven Cities".&lt;ref&gt;Cortesão (1954 (1975) p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt;

Already by the 1490s, there are rumors that [[silver]] can be found in the island's sands.&lt;ref&gt;In the Paris map ("Columbus Map") of c. 1500 (La Ronciere, 1924), the inscription by Antillia reads: ''Hec Septem Civitatum insula vocatur, nunc Portugallensium colonia efecta, ut Gromite citantur Hispanorum, in qua reperiri inter arenas argentum perhibetur.'' ("Here is the island called of the Seven Cities, a colony inhabited by Portuguese, according to some Spanish sailors, in the sands of which silver can be found.")&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, the legend gave rise to the independent Spanish legends of the [[Seven Cities of Gold]], reputed by mercenary [[conquistadors]] to be fabulously wealthy and located somewhere on the mainland of America.

== Etymology ==
[[Image:Pareto 1455.jpg|thumb|1455 map of [[Bartolomeo Pareto]]. Antilia is the large island on the western edge.]] 
The term ''Antillia'' is probably derived from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]  "Ante-Ilha" ("Fore-Island", "Island of the Other", or "Opposite Island").&lt;ref&gt;Cortesão (1954 (1975): p.107).&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be a reference to the belief that the island lay directly "opposite" from mainland Portugal (as it is usually charted), consistent with the Seven Cities story.  Its size and rectangular shape is a near-mirror image of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] itself.  Some suggest the ''ante-ilha'' etymology might be older, possibly related in meaning to the "Aprositus" ("the Inaccessible"), the name reported by [[Ptolemy]] for one of the [[Fortunate Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaffarel (1882:[https://books.google.com/books?id=NmxIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.204])&lt;/ref&gt;

Others regard the "ante-ilha" etymology as unsatisfactory, on the basis that "ante", in geographical usage, suggests it sits opposite another island, not a continent.&lt;ref&gt;This objection was already articulated by Vicenzio Formaleoni (1783: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zso9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.27-28]), one of the first to draw scholarly attention to Antillia.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, alternative etymological theories of ''Antillia'' abound.  One theory was that "Antillia" is merely a poorly-transcribed reference to Plato's "[[Atlantis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Babcock (1922: [https://books.google.com/books?id=-vYrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.148]). D'Avezac (1845: [https://books.google.com/books?id=BbEBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.27]) briefly entertained this theory. The Atlantis etymology was also considered, and discarded, by Humboldt (1837: [https://books.google.com/books?id=EicSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA192#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.192]). See Cortesão (1954 (1975): p.118).  It has however, remained extant among some modern "Atlantis" theorists.  Lewis Spence (1925) suggested that Antilla is the remnant of Atlantis, which had broken up following a natural disaster. Spence (p.87) cites Brasseur de Bourgbourg, Bancroft and Le Plongeon as supporters of this theory, "none of them authorities of any great weight, I fear, and all inclined to rashness."&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that it is a corruption of ''[[Getulia]]'', an ancient Roman name for a geographical location in northwestern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;This was first forwarded by Crone (1938) and initially favored by Morison (1940). See Diffie and Winius (1977: p.441).  Although commonly associated with the North African hinterlands, Crone asserts that "Getulia" is identified by some Medieval geographers as the ancient name of the location of where [[Hercules]] was alleged to have set up his pillars ([[Pillars of Hercules]]). However, later, Morison (1955: p.469) embraces the 'ante-ilha' hypothesis, stating its "fairly obvious" that "the name means nothing more or less than opposite island or island over against". Crone (1955) published a note acknowledging the alternative reading of the 1367 inscription he believed was Getulia as "Arcules" (Hercules), stating it "deserves consideration", although it remains unclear whether he had abandoned his own Getulia reading.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another theory, famously forwarded by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] is that it comes from the [[Arabic]] ''al-Tin'' or ''al-Tennyn'', for "[[dragon]]", a reference to the old Arab legends about sea dragons on the edge of the ocean (frequently depicted in Arab maritime charts), and that the island may have been known as ''Jezirat al Tennyn'', or "Dragon's Isle", in Andalusian Arab legend.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1837) ''Examen critique'', Vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EicSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.211]. This hypothesis was in fact first proposed by Buache (1806: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5XRFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.27-28]).  See also d'Avezac (1845: p.27).&lt;/ref&gt;

One more recent hypothesis (although not finding wide acceptance), is that ''Antillia'' may mean "in front of [[Thule]]".&lt;ref name=Barreto163&gt;Barreto (1992: p.163) published this hypothesis.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes written ''Tile'', Thule was a semi-mythical reference to [[Iceland]], already spoken of in [[classical antiquity|classical]] sources.  If so, then ''ante Tile'', the "island before Thule", might very well be [[Ireland]], which might have had seven "cities" at the time.&lt;ref&gt;According to Barreto (1992: p.163), Ireland had seven [[City status in Ireland|cities]] at the time, which he lists as [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]], [[Wexford]], [[Dublin]], [[Dundalk]] and [[Belfast]], all of which happen to be situated on the coast, at or not too far from bays.  However, the author of this article could not find corroboration for Barreto's statement. On a side note, J. Godkin (1867, ''Ireland and her Churches'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pi8NAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.23]) notes that in old Irish churches, a diocese typically had not one, but ''seven'' "bishops".&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory, however, seems highly speculative. Ireland (''Hibernia'') was well-known and appears distinctly on all 15th-century maps.

In a fresh work on the subject, the author Demetrio Charalambous notes that in medieval maps, the name of the island is written Antylia, which is inconsistent with the interpretation commonly accepted that the name means "ante-ilha" in Portuguese. No medieval map records the name "Antilha", by which the author dismisses the name as being Portuguese. Instead, he noted that the first cartographers to mention the island (although they did not represent it) were Francesco and Domenico Pizigano in 1367, who called it Antullia. From this follows that the name means "Anti-Tullia", i.e. Anti-Thule, later transformed into Antyllia, and finally Antillia.&lt;ref&gt;Charalambous, Demetrio, "Descubrimiento en el mar de papel", Buenos Aires, 1995. See also "The enigma of the isle of gold", in Revista de Historia de América, number 118, July–December 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his interpretation, the name denotes the island opposite to Tyle, but this does not mean it is before Iceland, but beyond it, as represented in the maps. The name means the island opposite to Tyle by sailing southwest, and therefore refers to America.

== Cartographic representation ==

The rediscovery of the [[Canary Islands]] by Europeans in the 14th century revived an interest in Atlantic island myths.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  With the existence of lands out in the Atlantic Ocean confirmed, 14th-century European geographers began plumbing the old legends and plotting and naming many of these mythical islands on their nautical charts, alongside the new discoveries. Mythical Atlantic islands litter the early 14th-century [[portolan charts]] of [[Pietro Vesconte]] and [[Angelino Dulcert]].

Some historians believe the legend of ''Antillia'' was first insinuated cartographically in the 1367 portolan of the Venetian brothers [[Domenico and Francesco Pizzigano]]. This was insinuated by an inscription (albeit with no island) on the western edge of the map, which was read by some 19th-century historians as referring to "statues on the shores of ''Atullia''" (''ante ripas Atulliae'') beyond which sailors should not pass.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Nicholas Buache (1806: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5XRFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=falsep.25-26]), Konrad Kretschmer (1892: [https://books.google.com/books?id=UjI_AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA195#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 195-7]), A.E. Nordenskiöld (1897: p.164).&lt;/ref&gt; However, later readings have suggested it should be read as the statues of ''Arcules'' ([[Hercules]]), and that the inscription's reference is probably to the [[Pillars of Hercules]], the ''[[non plus ultra]]'' (outer limits) of ancient navigation, and not Antillia.&lt;ref&gt;This was first proposed by Hennig (1945) and supported by Armando Cortesão (1954 (1975) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2PbNS0LHn60C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=RA1-PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false, p.106]). Cortesão ([https://books.google.com/books?id=2PbNS0LHn60C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=RA1-PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.74]) notes that an inscription about Hercules's "statues" to mark the edge of safe navigation was common practice in Arab charts. Crone (1938) first proposed to read it as ''Getulliae'' ([[Getulia]]), but later (Crone, 1947) acknowledged the Hercules reading.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pizzigano 1424 map (Antilia islands detail).JPG|thumb|120px|1424 map of [[Zuane Pizzigano]]. First clear depiction of ''Antillia'' (large red rectangle), ''Ymana'' (future ''Royllo'', small blue island to the west), ''Satanazes'' (large blue rectangle to the north) and ''Saya'' (future ''Damnar'', umbrella-shaped red isle far north)]] 
Antillia makes its first unambiguous appearance in the 1424 [[portolan chart]] of [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] cartographer [[Zuane Pizzigano]], as part of a group of four islands, lying far in the Atlantic Ocean some 250 leagues west of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], and 200 leagues west of the [[Azores]] archipelago (which also usually depicted in contemporary charts). Pizzigano drew Antillia as a large, red, rectangular island, indented with bays and dotted with seven settlements, with the inscription ''ista ixola dixemo antilia'' ("this island is called antillia"). Some sixty leagues north of it is the comparable large blue [[Satanazes]] island (''ista ixolla dixemo satanazes'', called Satanagio/Satanaxio/Salvagio in later maps), capped by a small umbrella-shaped ''Saya'' (called 'Tanmar' or 'Danmar' in later maps). Some twenty leagues west of Antilia is the small blue companion island of ''Ymana'' (the '[[Royllo]]' of later maps). These four islands will be collectively drawn together in many later 15th-century maps, with the same relative size, position and shape Pizzigano gave them in 1424. They are commonly referred to collectively as the "Antillia group" or (to use Beccario's label) the ''insulae de novo rep(er)te'' ("islands newly reported").

# 1493 anonymous [[Laon globe]]
# c. 1500 Paris map ("Columbus map") of anonymous Portuguese/Genoese (?) cartographer.&lt;ref&gt;The "Columbus Map", held by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris and dated tentatively between 1490 and 1500, was attributed by La Ronciere (1924) to [[Christopher Columbus]] himself, possibly under the supervision of [[Bartholomew Columbus]]. Although this is now doubted, it is still sometimes called the "Columbus map". Cortesão (1954) identifies the author as Portuguese, others as a Genoese living in Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt;
# 1507-08 map of [[Johannes Ruysch]] – relocates Satanazes to [[Isle of Demons]](?), relates legend.

As is evident, on some maps (e.g. Pareto, Soligo, Behaim), Antillia appears without Satanazes.&lt;ref&gt;Cortesão (1954 (1975): p.134)&lt;/ref&gt;

Significantly, although included in his map of 1436, the Antillia group is omitted in the later [[Andrea Bianco]] map of 1448, although some authors believe that two rectangular islands depicted by Bianco much further south (in the environs of [[Cape Verde]]), and labelled merely ''dos ermanos'' ("two brothers") may be a reference to Antilia and Satanazes.

The controversial (possibly fake) [[Vinland map]], dated by its supporters around 1440, shows the outlines of Antillia and Satanazes islands (but not the two smaller ones) under the general label ''Magnae insulae Beati Brandani'' (great islands of St Brendan).

Antillia (and all its companions) are conspicuously omitted in the map of [[Gabriel de Vallseca]] (1439), the [[Genoese map]] (1457), the [[Fra Mauro map]] (1459) and the maps of [[Henricus Martellus Germanus]] (1484, 1489) and [[Pedro Reinel]] (c. 1485). With a few exceptions (e.g. Ruysch), Antillia disappears from almost all known maps composed after [[Christopher Columbus]]'s [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|voyages]] to the [[Americas]] in the 1490s (e.g. it is absent on the [[Map of Juan de la Cosa|1500 map]] of [[Juan de la Cosa]], the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502, etc.)

It appears in virtually all of the known surviving [[Portolan charts]] of the Atlantic – notably those of the Genoese B. Beccario or Beccaria (1435), the Venetian Andrea Bianco (1436), and Grazioso Benincasa (1476 and 1482).&lt;ref&gt;See also- Bartolomeo de Pareto, 1455; Petrus Roselli, 1468, held by the Hispanic Society of America; attr. Toscanelli, 1474: original is lost, but a copy survives in Columbus's notes&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually accompanied by the smaller and equally legendary islands of [[Royllo]], [[St Atanagio]], and [[Tanmar]], the whole group often classified as ''insulae de novo repertae'', newly discovered islands.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Antilia|volume=2|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On these maps, Antillia was typically depicted on a similar scale to that of Portugal, lying around 200 miles west of the Azores. It was drawn as an almost perfect rectangle, its long axis running north-south, but with seven [[trefoil]] bays shared between the east and west coasts. Each city lay on a bay. The form of the island occasionally becomes more figurative than the semi-abstract representations of Bartolomeo de Pareto, Benincasa and others: [[Andrea Bianco|Bianco]], for instance, shifts its orientation to northwest-southeast, transmutes generic bays into river mouths (including a large one on the northeastern coast), and elongates a southern tail into a [[Cape (geography)|cape]] with a small cluster of [[islets]] offshore.

[[Image:Bianco.jpg|thumb|Andea Bianco, 1436. Antillia at left]]
Around the time of Spain's discovery of South America, Antillia dwindles substantially in size on [[Behaim]]'s globe and later charts. Contrary to the earlier descriptions of the two island groups as distinct entities, a 16th-century notion relegates Antillia to the island of [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]], the largest of the [[Azores]], where a national park centering on two lakes still bears the name [[Sete Cidades National Park (Azores)|Sete Cidades]].

==Medieval beliefs and the Age of Discovery==
A Portuguese legend tells how the island was settled in the early 8th century in the face of the [[Moors|Moor]]ish conquest of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] by the Archbishop of [[Porto]], six other [[bishop]]s and their parishioners to avoid the ensuing Moorish invasion.  Each congregation founded a city, namely, Aira, Anhuib, Ansalli, Ansesseli, Ansodi, Ansolli and Con,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pizzigano map]], 1424&lt;/ref&gt; and once established, burnt their caravel ships as a symbol of their autonomy. The reporting of this settlement comes courtesy of a young couple who eloped back to Europe on a rare trading ship&lt;ref&gt;For a modern recantation of the various early sources, see [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=Ameh7XS76BEC&amp;dq=tales+of+the+enchanted+islands+of+the+atlantic&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=OUa7I4Cgee&amp;sig=hdVbcUSFJrqtYxX1hZLmh9MqyRA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPR1,M1 ''Tales of the Enchanted Islands of the Atlantic''], Thomas Wentworth-Higginson, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; and reported the seven cities as a model of agricultural, economic and cultural harmony. Centuries later, the island became known as a proto-[[utopian]] commonwealth, free from the disorders of less favoured states.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Since these events predated the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the clergy's heritage marked a claim to significant strategical gains, Spain counterclaimed that the expedition was, in fact, theirs.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales of the Enchanted Islands of the Atlantic'', Thomas Wentworth-Higginson, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the chief early descriptions of the heritage of Antillia is inscribed on the globe which the geographer [[Martin Behaim]] made at [[Nuremberg]] in 1492. Behaim relates the Catholic escape from the barbarians, though his date of 734 is probably a mistake for 714. The inscription adds that a Spanish vessel sighted the island in 1414,&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; while a Portuguese crew claimed to have landed on Antillia in the 1430s.

In a later version of the legend, the bishops fled from [[Mérida, Spain]], when Moors attacked it around the year 1150.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
[[File:Atlantic Ocean, Toscanelli, 1474.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli|Toscanelli]]'s notions of the geography of the Atlantic Ocean. Antillia at the middle-right.]]
With this legend underpinning the growing reports of a bountiful civilisation midway between Europe and [[Cipangu]], or Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Toscanelli]]'s 1474 letter to the Spanish Court, 'Toscanelli and Columbus', H. Vignaud, 1902&lt;/ref&gt; the quest to discover the Seven Cities attracted significant attention. However, by the last decade of the 15th century, the Portuguese state's official sponsorship of such exploratory voyages had ended,&lt;ref&gt;RA Skelton, "Explorers' Maps: Chapters in the Cartographic Record of Geographical Discovery" https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=61480298&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1492, under the Spanish flag of [[Ferdinand and Isabella]], [[Christopher Columbus]] set out on his historic journey to [[Asia]], citing the island as the perfect halfway house by the authority of [[Paul Toscanelli]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Toscanelli]]'s 1474 letter to the Spanish Court, RA Skelton, "Explorers' Maps: Chapters in the Cartographic Record of Geographical Discovery"&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus had supposedly gained charts and descriptions from a Spanish navigator, who had "sojourned&amp;nbsp;... and died also" at Columbus's home in Madeira, after having made landfall on Antillia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]], ''De Orbe Novo'', 1511–1125 https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12425&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later influence==
Others following [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera|d'Anghiera]] suggested contenders in the West Indies for Antillia's heritage (most often either [[Puerto Rico]] or [[Trinidad]]), and as a result the Caribbean islands became known as the [[Antilles]]. As European explorations continued in the Americas, maps reduced the scale of the island Antillia, tending to place it mid-Atlantic, whereas the [[Seven Cities of Gold]] were attributed to mainland Central or North America, as the various European powers vied for territory in the New World.

The text, with the stories of early 8th-century conquests of Muhammad bin Qasim, has been long considered to be a 13th-century translation into Persian by `Ali Kufi of an undated, original but unavailable Arabic text.{{sfnp|Asif, A Book of Conquest|2016|p=8–15}}&lt;ref name=cacnama&gt;{{cite | title=ČAČ-NĀMA in Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | author=Friedmann, Y |editor= P.

Its story has been a part of state-sanctioned history textbooks of [[Pakistan]], but the text in reality is original and "not a work of translation".&lt;ref name="Asif2016p4"&gt;{{harvp|Asif, A Book of Conquest|2016|p=4–15,&amp;nbsp;20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

It contains an introductory chapter about the history of Sindh just before its conquest by the Arabs. The body of the work narrates the Arab inclursions into Sindh of the 7th-8th centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Friedmann, “Čač-Nāma”, in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', ed. by P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, and W.P. Heinrichs (Leiden: Brill, 1981). Consulted online on 04 December 2016 DOI:10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_8436.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it chronicles the Chacha Dynasty's period, following the demise of the [[Rai Dynasty]] and the ascent of [[Chach of Alor]] to the [[throne]], down to the [[Muslim conquests|Arab conquest]] by [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] in early 8th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chachnamah, An Ancient History of Sind, Giving the Hindu period down to the Arab Conquest''. (1900). Translated from the Persian by Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg. Karachi: Commissioners Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The text concludes with 'an epilogue describing the tragic end of the Arab commander [[Muḥammad b. al-Ḳāsim al-Thaḳafī|Muḥammad b. al-Ḳāsim]] and of the two daughters of [[Raja Dahir|Dāhir]], the defeated king of Sind'.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Friedmann, “Muḥammad b. al- Ḳāsim”, in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', ed. by P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, and W.P. Heinrichs (Leiden: Brill, 1981). Consulted online on 04 December 2016 DOI:10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_8436.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Significance==

As one of the only written sources about the Arab conquest of Sindh, and therefore the origins of [[Islam in India]], the ''Chach Nama'' is a key historical text that has been co-opted by different interest groups for several centuries, and it has significant implications for modern imaginings about the place of Islam in South Asia. Accordingly, its implications are much disputed.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Syed Nomanul Haq, 'Gujarati Sandals in Baghdad: Decolonising History' [review of Manan Ahmed Asif, ''A Book of Conquest: The Chachnama and Muslim Origins in South Asia'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2016)], ''Herald'' (19 November 2016), http://herald.dawn.com/news/1153594/gujarati-sandals-in-baghdad-decolonising-history.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Manan Ahmed Asif, the ''Chach Nama'' has been historically significant. It was a source of colonial understanding of the origins of Islam in the [[Indian subcontinent]] through the Sindh region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Asif, A Book of Conquest|2016|p=5–6}}: "this thirteenth-century Persian text became, in colonial understanding, a history of Muslim origins".&lt;/ref&gt; The text has been one of the sources of historiography and religious antagonism during the South Asian people's struggles to gain independence from the colonial British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Asif, A Book of Conquest|2016|p=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text, states Asif, has been a source of a colonial construction of a long history of religious antagonism between Hindus and Muslims, and one of narratives of Muslim origins in South Asia by various twentieth-century historians and writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Asif, A Book of Conquest|2016|p=3–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been a part of state-sanctioned history textbooks of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Asif2016p4"/&gt; The story of the seventeen-year-old Muhammad bin Qasim's attack on "Pak-o-Hind" was mentioned by the Pakistani professional [[Faisal Shahzad]] prior to his [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Asif, A Book of Conquest|2016|p=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins, authorship, and preservation==

===Translation of Arabic original===
As we have it today, the ''Chach Nama'' is the work of ʿAlī b. Ḥāmid b. Abī Bakr Kūfī. He was writing in Persian, but claimed to be translating a book in Arabic, which he had discovered among the possessions of the [[Qadi|ḳāḍī]] of [[Aror|Alōr]], Ismāʿīl b. ʿAlī ... b. ʿU&lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt;mān al-&lt;u&gt;Th&lt;/u&gt;aḳafī (who was appointed the first kādī of Alōr by Muhammad Kāsim after the conquest of the [[Sindh]].&lt;ref&gt;History of Sind. Vol. II. (In two parts) Part II—Giving the Reigns of the Kalhórahs and the Tálpurs down to the British Conquest. Translated from Persian by Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg, Chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref name=friedmann&gt;Y. Friedmann, “Čač-Nāma”, in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', ed. by P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, and W.P. Heinrichs (Leiden: Brill, 1981). Consulted online on 04 December 2016 DOI:10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_8436.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Y. Friedmann,

&lt;blockquote&gt;a comparison between the Čač-Nāma and Arab historians such as Balā&lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;urī [...] bears out the Arab provenance of those parts of the book that describe the battles leading to the conquest of Sind; Kūfī might well have used Madāʾinī’s ''Kitāb &lt;u&gt;Th&lt;/u&gt;a&lt;u&gt;gh&lt;/u&gt;r al-Hind'' and ''Kitāb ʿUmmāl'' (or ''Aʿmāl'') ''al-Hind'' [...] The Čač-Nāma seems to have preserved Madāʾinī’s tradition concerning India in a much fuller fashion than classical Arab histories. On the other hand, the book also comprises a considerable amount of material which probably reflects a local Indian historical tradition. The part dealing with the rise of the Čač dynasty (14-72), the story of Darōhar, Djaysinha and Djanki (229-234), and some traditions attributed to a Brahman called Rāmsiya (179) and to “some Brahman elders” (''baʿḍī ma&lt;u&gt;sh&lt;/u&gt;āyi&lt;u&gt;kh&lt;/u&gt;-i barāhima'') (197; cf. also 206&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;) deserve to be mentioned in this context.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Friedmann, “Čač-Nāma”, in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', ed. by P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, and W.P. Heinrichs (Leiden: Brill, 1981). Consulted online on 04 December 2016 DOI:10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_8436.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Chach Nama'' survived in the following key manuscripts: British Library Or. 1787; India Office, Ethé 435.&lt;ref name=cacnama/&gt;

===Original work===
According to [[Manan Ahmed Asif]], ''Chach Nama'' is not a work of translation nor is a book of conquest. ʿAlī states that he wrote it to gain favor in the court of Nasiruddin Qabacha. Asif adds that Qasim's campaign in ''Chach Nama'' is a deliberate shadowing of campaigns Chach undertook in "four corners of Sindh".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Asif, A Book of Conquest|2016|p=14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that the ''Chach Nama'' is centred on the historical figure of [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] found in extant Arabic manuscripts, but the 13th-century text is different, creatively extrapolating the alternative versions.{{sfn|Asif, A Book of Conquest|2016|pp=38–44, 59-65}} For example, the version of Qasim story found in the ''Kitab Futuh al-Buldan'' of the 9th-century [[Al-Baladhuri]] and the version found in memoirs of 11th-century [[Al-Biruni]], are much simpler, "markedly different" in structure, circumstances and martial campaign than that elaborated in the ''Chach Nama''.{{sfn|Asif, A Book of Conquest|2016|pp=26, 38–44, 59-65, 110-112}} In the Baladhuri version, for example, Qasim does not enter or destroy ''budd'' (temples) or call them "like the churches of the Christians and the Jews and the fire houses of the Magians".{{sfn|Asif, A Book of Conquest|2016|pp=38–44}} Further the Baladhuri version of the Qasim story repeatedly credits the monks and priestly mediators of Hind with negotiating peace with him, while ''Chach Nama'' presents a different, martial version. The ''Chach Nama'' drew upon Baladhuri's work, and others, as a template for the political history, but created a different and imaginative version of events. According to Asif, "there is little reason for us to consider the facticity" of verses in the Baladhuri's version either, an account written to glorify the martial conquest of courtly Abbasid times and composed over 200 years after Qasim's death. The ''Chach Nama'' is a romantic work influenced by the 13th-century history, not a historical text of the 8th-century, states Asif.{{sfn|Asif, A Book of Conquest|2016|pp=2-16, 40, 33–44}}

==Accuracy==

The Táríkh Maasúmí, and the Tuhfatulkirám are two other Muslim histories of the same period and, on occasion, give differing accounts of some details. Later Muslim chronicles like those by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]], Nurul Hakk, [[Firishta]], and [[Masum Shah]] draw their account of the Arab conquest from the Chach Nama.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Scholars such as Peter Hardy, André Wink and Yohanan Friedmann, question the historical authenticity and political theory embedded in the ''Chachnama'' because of its geographical errors, glaring inconsistencies with alternate Persian and Arabic accounts of the Qasim story, and the missing Arabic tradition in it even though the text alleges to be a Persian translation of an Arabic original.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hardy (1982), ''Is the Chach Nama intelligible as Political Theory?'', in Sind through the Centuries, Ed: Hamida Khuro, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195772500}}, pages 111-117&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Friedmann, The origins and significance of the Chach Nāma|1984}}&lt;ref&gt;Andre Wink (2002), Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam 7th-11th Centuries, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-0391041738}}, pages 192-196&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2444">'''Dennis J. Hutchinson''' (born 1946) is a Senior Lecturer in Law at the [[University of Chicago Law School|University of Chicago]], and Master of the undergraduate College's New Collegiate Division where he directs the Law, Letters, and Society program. His interests primarily lie in the field constitutional law, paying special attention to issues of race. Indeed, he is perhaps best known within the legal community at large for his work as Editor of the Law School's ''[[Supreme Court Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/hutchinson&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchinson graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Bowdoin College]], and studied briefly as a JD candidate at Chicago before attending  [[Oxford University]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] in Jurisprudence, where he graduated with a BA and MA. Upon return to the United States, he completed his formal studies at the [[University of Texas Law School]], where he took an [[Master of Law|LLM]]. Hutchinson then served as a law clerk to Justice [[William O. Douglas]] and Justice [[Byron White]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. His biography of ''Whizzer White''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hutchinson-whizzer.html&lt;/ref&gt; was a ''[[New York Times]]'' 'Notable Book' for 1998.  He was once married to Judge [[Diane Pamela Wood]], who sits on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], and who remains an academic colleague.

Hutchinson was one of several law faculty members who were called upon by various media sources to provide commentary about President Barack Obama's tenure teaching constitutional law at the school, and was largely supportive.

The [[Flynn effect]] has been often cited as an example of euthenics. Another example is the steady increase in body size in industrialized countries since the beginning of the 20th century.

Euthenics is not normally interpreted to have anything to do with changing the composition of the human gene pool by definition, although everything that affects society has some effect on who reproduces and who does not.&lt;ref name="definitionsnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.definitions.net/definition/Euthenics|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Definitions for Euthenics|website=definitions.net|year=|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Ellen Swallow Richards]], the first female student and instructor at MIT.]]
The term was derived in the late 19th century from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb ''eutheneo'', εὐθηνέω (''eu'', well; the, root of τίθημι ''tithemi'', to cause).

(To be in a flourishing state, to abound in, to prosper.—''[[Demosthenes]]''. To be strong or vigorous.—''[[Herodotus]]''. To be vigorous in body.—''[[Aristotle]]''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;)

Also from the Greek [[Euthenia]], Εὐθηνία. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.—''Herodotus''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;

The opposite of Euthenia is [[Penia]], Πενία ("deficiency" or "[[poverty]]") the personification of poverty and need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Penia.html Theoi Project - Penia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Ellen Swallow Richards|Ellen H. Swallow Richards]] (1842&amp;ndash;1911; Vassar Class of '70) was one of the first writers to use the term, in ''The Cost of Shelter'' (1905), with the meaning "the science of better living".&lt;ref name="askdefine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnKGrandy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grandy | first = John K. | authorlink = John K. Grandy | editor-last = Birx | editor-first = H.J. | title = Euthenics | series = Encyclopedia of Anthropology | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | volume = 5 Vols. | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781412952453 | doi = 10.4135/9781412952453 | url =http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/anthropology/n312.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if (and probably unlikely that) any of the study programs of euthenics ever completely embraced Richards' multidisciplinary concept, though several nuances remain today, especially that of [[interdisciplinarity]].

===Vassar College Institute of Euthenics===
[[File:Julia Clifford Lathrop first chief US Childrens Bureau.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Julia Clifford Lathrop as the first chief of the U.S. Children's Bureau.]]
After Richards' death in 1911, [[Julia Lathrop]] (1858&amp;ndash;1932; VC '80)—one of Vassar's most distinguished alumnae—continued to promote the development of an interdisciplinary program in euthenics at the college.  Lathrop soon teamed with alumna [[Minnie Cumnock Blodgett]] (1862–1931; VC '84), who with her husband, [[John W. Blodgett|John Wood Blodgett]], offered financial support to create a program of euthenics at [[Vassar College]]. Curriculum planning, suggested by Vassar president [[Henry Noble MacCracken]] in 1922, began in earnest by 1923, under the direction of Professor Annie Louise Macleod (Chemistry; First woman PhD, McGill University, 1910).&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory" /&gt;

According to Vassar's chronology entry for March 17, 1924, "the faculty recognized euthenics as a satisfactory field for sequential study (major). A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a [[Interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary program]] [radical at the time] focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. Students in euthenics could take courses in horticulture, food chemistry, sociology and statistics, education, child study, economics, economic geography, physiology, hygiene, public health, psychology and domestic architecture and furniture. With the new division came the first major in child study at an American liberal arts college."&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1924/1924-03-17-euthenics.html |title= A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a multidisciplinary program focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a typical major in child study in euthenics includes introductory psychology, laboratory psychology, applied psychology, child study and social psychology in the Department of Psychology; the three courses offered in the Department of Child Study; beginning economics, programs of social reorganization and the family in Economics; and in the Department of Physiology, human physiology, child hygiene, principles of public health.&lt;ref name="Lockwood"&gt;*{{cite book | last = Lockwood | first = Helen Drusilla | authorlink = Helen Drusilla Lockwood | title = The Meaning of Euthenics; An Essay on Action as a Tool of Knowledge. | publisher = [[Vassar College]] | location = [[Poughkeepsie, NY]] | year = 1929 | isbn = | url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015019910382;view=1up;seq=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vassar [[Summer Institute of Euthenics]] accepted its first students in June 1926. Created to supplement the controversial euthenics major which began February 21, 1925, it was also located in the new Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics ([[York &amp; Sawyer]], architects; ground broke October 25, 1925). Some Vassar faculty members (perhaps emotionally upset with being displaced on campus to make way, or otherwise politically motivated) contentiously "believed the entire concept of euthenics was vague and counter-productive to women's progress."&lt;ref name="SummerInstitute"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/organizations-events-activities/the-vassar-summer-institute.html |title= The Vassar Summer Institute |author= Vassar Historian |date=  |website= vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher=  |accessdate= 26 August 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120304011536/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/organizations-events-activities/the-vassar-summer-institute.html |archivedate= 4 March 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having overcome a lukewarm reception, Vassar College officially opened its Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics in 1929.&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |title=The Disappointing First Thrust of Euthenics |author=Vassar Historian |date= |website=vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127020842/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |archivedate=27 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ruth Wheeler (Physiology and Nutrition – VC '99) took over as director of euthenics studies in 1924. Wheeler remained director until [[Mary Shattuck Fisher Langmuir]] (VC '20) succeeded her in 1944, until 1951.&lt;ref name="SummerInstitute" /&gt;

The college continued for the 1934–35 academic year its successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls.  Intended to help students meet their college costs by working in their residences. For example, in Main, students earned $40 a year by doing relatively light work such as cleaning their rooms.&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle1934"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1934/1934-03-10-coops.html |title= The college announced the trustees' decision to continue for the 1934-35 academic year this year's successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Katharine Blodgett Hadley (VC '20) donated $400,000, through the [[Rubicon Foundation]], to Vassar to help fund operating deficits in the current and succeeding years and to improve faculty salaries.&lt;ref name="VassarChronicleMay1951"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1951/1951-05-23-blodgett-gift.html |title= President Blanding announced a $400,000 gift to the college from the chair of the board of trustees, Katharine Blodgett Hadley '20, through the Rubicon Foundation. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elmira College===
[[Elmira College]] is noted as the oldest college still in existence which (as a [[Timeline of women's colleges in the United States#First and oldest|college for women]]) granted degrees to women which were the equivalent of those given to men (the first to do so was the now-defunct [[Mary Sharp College]]).&lt;ref name="WomensCollegesUS"&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elmira College became coeducational in all of its programs in 1969.

A special article was written in the December 12, 1937 ''[[New York Times]]'', quoting recent graduates of Elmira College, urging for courses in colleges for men on the care of children. Reporting that "preparation for the greatest of all professions, that of motherhood and child-training, is being given the students at Elmira College in the Nursery School which is Conducted as part of the Department of Euthenics."&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

Elmira College was one of the first of the liberal arts colleges to recognize the fact that women should have some special training, integrated with the so-called liberal studies, which would prepare them to carry on, with less effort and fewer mistakes, a successful family life. Courses in nutrition, household economics, clothing selection, principles of foods and meal planning, child psychology, and education in family relations are a part of the curriculum.&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst"&gt;{{cite web

The Elmira College nursery school for fifteen children between the ages of two and five years was opened primarily as a laboratory for college students, but it had become so popular with parents in the community that there was always a long waiting list.&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

The ''New York Times'' article notes how the nursery had become one of the essential laboratories of the college, where recent mothers testified to the value of the training they received while in college. "Today," one graduate said, "when it is often necessary for young women to continue professional work outside the home after marriage, it is important that young fathers, who must share in the actual care and training of the children, should have some knowledge of correct methods."&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

===Today===
Many factors led to the movement never getting the funding it needed to remain relevant, including: vigorous debate about the exact meaning of euthenics, a strong [[antifeminism]] movement paralleling even stronger [[women's rights]] movements, confusion with the term eugenics, the economic impact of the [[Great Depression]] and two world wars. These factors also prevented the discipline from gaining the attention it needed to put together a lasting, vastly [[interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary]] curriculum. Therefore, it split off into separate disciplines. Child Study is one such curriculum.

Martin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that "Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/h/hearth/hygiene.html HEARTH Library-Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the end of euthenics as originally defined by Ellen Swallow Richards ensued.

==Relationship with eugenics==
According to Ellen Richards, in her book ''Euthenics: the science of controllable environment'' (1910):&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;
{{quote|The betterment of living conditions, through conscious endeavor, for the purpose of securing efficient human beings, is what the author means by Euthenics.

"Human vitality depends upon two primary conditions—[[heredity]] and [[hygiene]]—or conditions preceding birth and conditions during life."

[[Eugenics]] deals with race improvement through heredity.

Euthenics deals with race improvement through environment.

Eugenics is hygiene for the future generations.

Euthenics is hygiene for the present generation.

Eugenics must await careful investigation.

Euthenics has immediate opportunity.

Euthenics precedes eugenics, developing better men now, and thus inevitably creating a better race of men in the future. Euthenics is the term proposed for the preliminary science on which Eugenics must be based.}}

==Debate, misconceptions and opposition==
[[File:ЛестерФВорд.jpeg|200px|left|thumb|[[Lester Frank Ward]]]][[Image:aflexner21.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|[[Abraham Flexner]], c. 1895.]]
[[File:MargaretSanger-Underwood.LOC.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Margaret Sanger]], 1922]]
[[File:Charles Benedict Davenport.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Charles Benedict Davenport]], ca. 1929]]
Debate over misconceptions about the movement started almost from the beginning. In his comparison "Eugenics, Euthenics, And Eudemics", ([[American Journal of Sociology]], Vol. 18, No. 6, May 1913), [[Lester Frank Ward|Lester F. Ward]] of [[Brown University]] opens the second section regarding euthenics lamenting: 
{{quote|Is there, then, nothing to do? Are we to accept that modem scientific fatalism known as [[laissez faire]], which enjoins the folding of the arms? Are we to preach a gospel of inaction? I for one certainly am not content to do so, and I believe that nothing I have thus far said [about eugenics] is inconsistent with the most vigorous action, and that in the direction of the betterment of the human race. The end and aim of the eugenists cannot be reproached. The race is far from perfect. Its condition is deplorable. Its improvement is entirely feasible, and in the highest degree desirable. Nor do I refer merely to economic conditions, to the poverty and misery of the disinherited classes. The intellectual state of the world is deplorable, and its improvement is clearly within the reach of society itself. It is therefore a question of method rather than of principle that concerns us.}}

Ward later noted about the organic environment that:
{{quote|[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] has taught us that the chief barrier to the advance of any species of plants or animals is its competition with other plants and animals that contest the same ground. And therefore the fiercest opponents of any species are the members of the same species which demand the same elements of subsistence. Hence the chief form of relief in the organic world consists in the thinning-out of competitors. Any species of animals or plants left free to propagate at its normal rate would overrun the earth in a short time and leave no room for any other species. Any species that is sufficiently vigorous to resist its organic environment will crowd out all others and monopolize the earth. If nature permitted this there could be no variety, but only one monotonous aspect devoid of interest or beauty. Whatever we may think of the harsh method by which this is prevented, we cannot regret that it is prevented, and that we have a world of variety, interest, and aesthetic attractiveness.}}

Vassar historians note that "critics faulted the new program as a weakening of science and a slide into vocationalism.  The influential educator and historian of education, [[Abraham Flexner]]—one of the founders of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study—attacked the program, along with other “ad hoc” innovations like intercollegiate athletics and student governments, in Universities, American, English, German (1930)."&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle" /&gt;{{cquote|
"Well, what is euthenics?  Euthenics is the 'science of efficient living;' and the 'science' is artificially pieced together of bits of mental hygiene, child guidance, nutrition, speech development and correction, family problems, wealth consumption, food preparation, household technology, and horticulture....  The institute is actually justified in an official publication by the profound question of a girl student who is reported as asking, 'What is the connection of Shakespeare with having a baby?'  The Vassar Institute of Euthenics bridges this gap!"}}

In the summer of 1926, [[Margaret Sanger]] created a stir when she gave a radio address, called "Racial Betterment", in the first Euthenics Institute, where she praised attempts to "close our gates to the so-called 'undesirables'" and proposed efforts to "discourage or cut down on the rapid multiplication of the unfit and undesirable at home", by government-subsidized voluntary sterilization.  (from ''The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger'', vol. 1 (2003), Esther Katz, ed.)

Eugenicist, [[Charles Benedict Davenport]], noted in his article "Euthenics and Eugenics," found reprinted in the ''Popular Science Monthly'' of January 1911, page 18, 20:&lt;ref name="CharlesBenedictDavenport"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davenport | first = Charles Benedict | authorlink = Charles Benedict Davenport | title = Euthenics and Eugenics | journal = [[Popular Science Monthly]] | volume = 78 | location = New York |date=January 1911 | pages =16–20 | url = https://archive.org/stream/popularsciencemo78newyuoft#page/2/mode/2up | accessdate=September 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thus the two schools of euthenics and eugenics stand opposed, each viewing the other unkindly.  Against eugenics it is urged that it is a fatalistic doctrine and deprives life of the stimulus toward effort.  Against euthenics the other side urges that it demands an endless amount of money to patch up conditions in the vain effort to get greater efficiency.  Which of the two doctrines is true?

The thoughtful mind must concede that, as is so often the case where doctrines are opposed, each view is partial, incomplete and really false.  The truth does not exactly lie between the doctrines; it comprehends them both. What a child becomes is always the resultant of two sets of forces acting from the moment the fertilized egg begins its development—one is the set of internal tendencies and the other is the set of external influences.  What the result of an external influence—a particular environmental condition—shall be depends only in part upon the nature of the influence; it depends also upon the internal nature of the reacting [[protoplasm]].

Incest, cousin marriage, the marriage of defectives and tuberculous persons, are, in wide circles, taboo.  This fact affords the basis for the hope that, when the method of securing strong offspring, even from partially defective stock—and where is the strain without any defect?—is widely known, the teachings of science in respect even to marriage matings will be widely regarded and that in the generations to come the teachings and practice of euthenics will yield greater result because of the previous practice of the principles of eugenics.}}

{{cquote|From intensive study we realize the importance of eugenics—the right of birth, and also the subject of euthenics—the right to environment. Too little credit is given to environment when we speak of children having hereditary traits as "Like father, like son," or "Chip off the old block." Such phrases have their origin from the study of eugenics.  No one has ever taken an [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Edwards]] baby and reared it in a [[Jukes family|Jukes]] environment.}}

From 1980 until his death in 2017, he was a regular sports commentator on [[NPR]]'s ''[[Morning Edition]]'' radio program.

Deford wrote for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine from 1962 until his death in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conway|first1=Tyler|title=Former Sports Illustrated Writer Frank Deford Dies at Age 78|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2712390-former-sports-illustrated-writer-frank-deford-dies-at-age-78|website=Bleacher Report|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a correspondent for the ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]'' television program on [[HBO]].&lt;ref name="dwyer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dwyer|first1=Colin|title=Frank Deford, NPR's Longtime Philosopher Of Sports, Dies At 78|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/29/530600033/frank-deford-nprs-longtime-scholar-of-sports-dies-at-78|website=NPR.org|accessdate=29 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote 18 books, nine of them novels.  A member of the [[National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame]], Deford was six times voted [[National Sportswriter of the Year]] by the members of that organization, and was twice voted Magazine Writer of the Year by the ''Washington Journalism Review''.

In 2012, Deford became the first magazine recipient of the [[Red Smith Award]]. In 2013, he was awarded the [[National Humanities Medal]], was presented with the William Allen White Citation for "excellence in journalism" by the [[University of Kansas]], and became the first sports journalist ever to receive the [[National Press Foundation]]'s highest honor, the W.M. Kiplinger Award for Distinguished Contributions to Journalism.

Deford's archives are held by the [[University of Texas]], where an annual lecture is presented in his name.  He was a long-time advocate for research and treatment of [[cystic fibrosis]].

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Deford grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, the oldest of three sons, and attended the [[Calvert School]] and [[Gilman School]] in Baltimore. He is a graduate of [[Princeton University]] and resided in [[Key West, Florida]], with his wife, the former Carol Penner, who had been a fashion model.  They have two surviving children: Christian (b. 1969) and Scarlet (b. 1980).  Scarlet was adopted as an infant from the Philippines a few months after his daughter Alexandra's death from cystic fibrosis at age 8 on January 19, 1980.  Deford has two grandchildren; Annabel (b. 2010) and Hunter (b. 2012).  Deford met his wife in Delaware and they were married in Newport, Rhode Island in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/frank_deford/05/27/delaware/index.html | work=CNN | title=Gambling in Delaware is a sure bet | date=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/05/05-06deford-audio.html|title=January 1970 - Commonwealth Club|website=www.commonwealthclub.org|access-date=2005-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003143931/http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/05/05-06deford-audio.html|archive-date=2006-10-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
After graduation from Princeton in 1962, Deford began his career as a researcher at ''Sports Illustrated.''  In addition to his writing at ''Sports Illustrated'', he was a commentator on CNN and worked as a correspondent for HBO's ''Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel'' since 1995. He was a regular Wednesday commentator for NPR's ''[[Morning Edition]]'' from 1980 to 2016, when his essays became monthly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sometimes, You Have To Pass The Ball|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/01/20/463613975/wednesday-s-child|publisher=NPR|date=January 20, 2016|access-date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; until he retired in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526582433/deford-says-thanks-for-a-good-game-drops-mic|title=Deford Says Thanks For A Good Game, Drops Mic|website=NPR.org|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1981 novel ''[[Everybody's All-American]]'' was named one of ''Sports Illustrated's'' Top 25 Sports Books of All Time and was later made into a [[Everybody's All-American (film)|film of the same title]].

Much of the fiction he wrote is set outside of the sports realm. His last novel was the acclaimed ''Bliss, Remembered'', a 1930s romance between a pretty young American and the son of a German diplomat; the story is written from the point of view of the woman. He was also the screenwriter on the films ''Trading Hearts'' (1987) and ''Four Minutes'' (2005).&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Frank Deford|url=http://frankdefordbook.com/about.asp|website=Frank Deford Sports Writer / Novelist|access-date=20 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129125041/http://frankdefordbook.com/about.asp|archivedate=29 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Deford became editor-in-chief of ''[[The National Sports Daily|The National]]'', the first daily U.S. sports newspaper. It ceased publication after only 18 months. After writing for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Deford became a senior contributing writer at ''Sports Illustrated''.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

===Advocacy===
Deford served as chairman of the [[Cystic Fibrosis Foundation]] from 1982 until 1999 and was chairman emeritus after that. He became a cystic-fibrosis advocate after his daughter Alexandra was diagnosed with the illness in 1972. After she died at 8 on January 19, 1980, he chronicled her life in the memoir ''[[Alex: The Life of a Child]]''. The book was made into a movie starring [[Craig T. Nelson]] as Deford, [[Bonnie Bedelia]] as his wife Carol, and [[Gennie James]] as Alex.

===Death===
Deford died on May 28, 2017, at the age of 78, at his home in [[Key West, Florida]].&lt;ref name="dwyer"/&gt;

'''Herbert S. Klein''' is an American historian.

He was born in New York City in the borough of the Bronx on January 6, 1936.  He attended public schools in Far Rockaway Queens.  After graduating Far Rockaway High School, he first attended Syracuse University from 1953 to 1955 and then transferred to the University of Chicago, where he obtained his BA in history in 1957, his MA in 1959 and his PhD in 1963 with a major in history and a minor in anthropology.  He taught Latin American history at the University of Chicago from 1962 to 1969, rising from lecturer to the rank of associate professor with tenure. He then taught at Columbia University from 1969 to 2005, being named the Gouverneur Morris Professor of History in 2003. He retired from Columbia in 2005 and was named professor of history and director of the Center for Latin American Studies at Stanford University from 2005 to 2011.  After his retirement as director, he was named research fellow and curator of Latin American Collection, of the Hoover Institution of Stanford University in 2011–2017.

His main areas of interests are in comparative social history, quantitative methods in historical research and demographic history.  He has published some 25 books dealing with the history of slavery, the Atlantic slave trade, colonial fiscal history, and demographic history and has published extensively on the history of  Bolivia, Brazil and the United States.  He has been a [[Woodrow Wilson Fellow]], a [[Guggenheim Fellow]], a Fulbright Lecturer in numerous Latin American universities and received grants from the [[Ford Foundation]], the Social Science Research Council, the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Tinker Foundation. His honors include the 1977	"Socio-Psychological Prize" of the AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science), joint with Jonathan Kelley; the 2010 Premio em Historia e Ciencias Sociais of the Academia Brasileira de Letras, for his co-authored book ''Escravismo em São Paulo e Minas Gerais'' (joint with Iraci Costa and Francisco Vidal Luna) and in 2015 he received the Distinguished Service Award from the [[Conference on Latin American History]], the professional organization of Latin American historians. In 1982 he was elected chair of CLAH.  He was also editor of the [[Cambridge University Press]] Series of Latin American Monographs from 2003-2015.

His first book was ''Slavery in the Americas, A Comparative Study of Cuba and Virginia''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, published in 1967; and his most recent book is the joint authored study with Francisco Vidal Luna, ''The Economic and Social History of Brazil since 1889''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014. Many of his books have been translated into Portuguese and Spanish, and his ''Concise History of Bolivia'' aside from numerous editions in Spanish has appeared in several editions and re-printings in Chinese and Japanese, and  his ''The Atlantic Slave Trade''  was published in Italian as well as in Spanish and two different Portuguese editions.  Aside from his extensive work on Latin America, he has published a ''A Population History of the United States''. 2nd ed. revised, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2012 and ''Hispanics in the United States, 1980-2005.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010 (joint with [[Laird Bergad]]). He also published with John Tepaske five volumes on ''Royal Treasuries of the Spanish Empire in America, 1580-1825.''

[[File:Jozef Kowalewski 1878.png|thumb|right|180px|Józef Kowalewski (1878)]]
'''Józef Kowalewski''' ({{lang-ru|Иосиф Михайлович Ковалевский}}) (9 January 1801 – 7 November 1878) was a Polish [[oriental studies|orientalist]]. Founder of the [[Philomatic Association]], in 1824 convicted by the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] authorities for pro-independence Polish activity and exiled into Russia. Allowed to study at the [[Kazan State University|Kazan University]], he studied [[Mongolia]], particularly [[Mongolian language]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In 1833 he founded the Department of Mongolian Studies at Kazan University - the first in Europe. In the years 1844-1849 he published his major work - a Mongolian - Russian - French [[dictionary]]. In 1862 he was allowed to return to Poland (then a part of the Russian Empire); he refused to support the [[January Uprising]] and did not oppose [[Russification]] of Polish education, for which he became the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the Philological and Historical Faculty of the [[University of Warsaw]].

'''Konbit Soley Leve''' (English: ''Rising Sun Collective'') is a [[social movement]] which was founded in [[Cité Soleil]] in June 2011 by the city's residents. Its mission is to work to help the people of Cité Soleil better their lives, largely through the model of a traditional [[Haiti]]an [[Labour cooperatives|labor cooperative]] called a [http://www.wordnik.com/words/konbit konbit].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacome|first=Felipe|title=On konbit and the rise of Soley Leve|url=http://rootsofchangehaiti.wordpress.com/2012/02/29/on-konbit-and-the-rise-of-soley-leve-interview-with-robillard-robi-louino/|publisher=Roots of Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The movement was founded by 6 neighborhoods within Cité Soleil: La Difference (also as Twa Bebe), La Reference (also known as Bwa Nef), Ti Ayiti/Projet Lintho 1, Norway, Bo Gadrie/Soley 9, and Vodrey (in rural Cité Soleil). The initial meeting of these [[neighborhood]]s, which was the precursor to the founding of the movement, was facilitated by Future Generations, but the movement has no [[NGO]] or government body officially supporting it. The movement grew quickly in the first 6–8 months of its existence, and currently includes dozens of neighborhoods from nearly every area of Cité Soleil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soley Leve map|url=http://www.soley-leve.org/map|publisher=soley leve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Konbit Soley Leve is not an official [[organization]], and therefore does not undertake activities like a typical organization. It is horizontal in its structure, and initiatives are decided by [[consensus]] at open weekly meetings. The movement acts as an [[umbrella group|umbrella]] under which groups from different neighborhoods of Cité Soleil can come together to pursue common goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Soley Leve|url=http://www.soley-leve.org/about/|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The movement’s activities are financed by [[charitable contribution|contributions]] of local residents of the participating neighborhoods. Its activities are primarily in the domains of civic [[education]], [[civic action]] (volunteer [[street cleaning]], neighborhood [[beautification]] campaigns, etc.), [[environmental preservation]], and sustainable livelihood creation. One of the most visible forms of activities is the ''konbit'', in which residents of many different neighborhoods come together to help one neighborhood solve a problem, such as a flooded [[canal]].

Overall, Soley Leve is considered a [[philosophy]] as much as a movement. The philosophy is based on the principles of [[interdependence]] (neighborhoods working together), self-realization (that the community is in charge of its destiny), [[Individualism|self-reliance]] (that Cité Soleil does not need to be dependent upon outsiders), and [[empowerment]] (that the residents of Cité Soleil have the potential to change their own situations). Anyone who conducts activities in accordance with those principles is considered to be a part of the Soley Leve movement, whether or not they attend the open weekly meetings.

==Condura croatica==
In 1966, remains of two ships were accidentally found by the port of [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]], which, in 1974, were taken out and transferred to [[Zadar]] to restore and conserve the remains. Through [[radiocarbon dating]], it was established that these ships sailed from the end of 11th century to the start of 12th century.

==Suffixes==

* -'''a''',  -'''ya''' [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] means "of" (female) (by two surnames){{clarify|date=June 2015}}{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* -'''a'''- ([[Frisian languages|Frisian]]) "One of the good guys", could be -ma, -stra, -ta. Frisians took the oath of the Free Frisians {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}screaming 'Better dead than a slave' after which they could get their new surnames (see [[Eala Frya Fresena]]).
* -'''à''' (Catalan){{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* -'''ac''' ([[Croatian (language)|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slovenian (language)|Slovenian]], Southern French){{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

** -'''aitė''' (Lithuanian) signifies an unmarried female{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
*** -'''aty''' Americanized form{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* -'''aj''' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]) (pronounced AY; meaning  “of the" ) It denotes the name of the family, which mostly comes from the male founder of the family, but also from a place, as in, Lash-aj (from the village Lashaj of Kastrat, MM, Shkoder).  It is likely that its ancient form, still found in MM, was an [i] in front of the last name, as in ‘Déda i Lékajve’  (Déd of Lekës).  For ease of use, the [i] in front of the last name, and the ending _ve, were dropped.  If the last name ends in [a], then removing the [j] would give the name of the patriarch or the place, as in, Grudaj - j = Gruda (place in MM).  Otherwise, removing the whole ending [aj] yields the name of founder or place of origin, as in Lekaj - aj = Lek(ë).  Since the names are found most commonly in Malsi e Madhe (North) and Labëri (South), it is likely that this linguistic feature is very old.  It must have been lost as a result of foreign influences brought into Albania by the invaders.  {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Manesar Industries Welfare Association''' is an association that has been set up with the goal of fighting issues involving environmental justice that affect the region of [[Manesar#History|Manesar]]. Furthermore, it has been set up to ensure sustainable development vis-a-vis industry. This association along with was involved with the [[Fertile Land Protection Movement]] in putting forward a Citizen's Report that was filed against the Indian Supreme Court in early 2011. The association works in tandem with other associations to ensure that environmental justice issues in this area are given emphasis by the government as well as by other important entities.

== History ==
MIWA is based out of IMT (Industrial Model Township) Manesar. The members of MIWA ultimately want to ensure that Manesar is environmentally sustainable. Many members have either set up businesses or are associated with the region if Manesar because they live in an around the [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]], [[New Delhi]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The origins of the afforestation drive that is currently underway in Manesar was thought of all the way back in 1999, according to this [http://newsinfolinenews1.blogspot.com/1999/11/gurgaon-authorities-launch-drive-for.html news source]{{unreliable source?|date=September 2016}}. In other words, the desire to start a greening drive, revolving around afforestation and the sustainable usage of water can be traced all the way back to 1999.

Manesar Industries Welfare Association (MIWA)  fought a legal battle in the Supreme Court of India with the HSIIDC (Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructural Development Corporation) in 2011 to avoid the acquisition of farmers’ land spread over an area of 1100 acres by the Haryana government. The government was acquiring the land for the development of Manesar extension area known as Industrial Model Township (IMT) planned to spread in an area of over 6,000 acres. MIWA is a one-of-its kind industrial association as it battled for the cause of farmers whose agricultural land was acquired to be handed over to the same league of industrialists.  According to this article in the [https://archive.is/20130125054754/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Haryana/SC-throws-cold-water-on-govt-s-Manesar-plan/Article1-689689.aspx Hindustan Times] MIWA had supported the farmers’ movement known as Fertile Land Protection Movement in filing the written petition in the Supreme Court which gave relief to them by putting a stay order to the acquisition orders of the government. If MIWA had not decided to conserve this land, approximately 9500 acres of land would have been used for industrial purposes.

According to [https://archive.is/20130126190105/http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/4225876 The Hindustan Times], MIWA is involved with an afforestation drive in the Aravalli Hills. It is one of two organisations that have volunteered to ensure afforestation occurs in the Aravalli Hills. The organisations also have provided rainwater harvesting pits. This area of the Aravalli Hills is otherwise an extremely built-up area as it located in the Industrial Model Township (IMT), which includes the KMP highway as well as a Maruti unit.

In fact under the auspices of MIWA, a cleaning drive was implemented in two sectors of IMT Manesar, which is called Project "Naya Savera," which not only ensures that the roads on these two sectors are clean but also ensures employment for people.

According to this article in [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-07/gurgaon/28365384_1_mapping-project-fertile-land-industrialist Times of India], MIWA was also involved in a mapping project. The mapping project involved carrying out a survey of fertile and usable areas in and around the villages of IMT Manesar.

== Collaboration ==
MIWA, has especially collaborated with the [[Manesar#Protests against land acquisition|Fertile Land Protection Movement]], namely when filing the Citizen's Report in early 2011. Thus in order to provide more support, these two grassroots-based organizations collaborated vis-a-vis the Citizen's Report in early 2011.

==Environmental Justice aspect==
The work carried out by MIWA helps to solve an Environmental Justice issue inherent in India. This issue involves the maintenance of jobs to those who need them the most, namely farmers, who otherwise lack education to get jobs outside the farming communities. Furthermore, it is an Environmental Justice issue because local jobs in the form of farming are diminishing in the name of development. As a result, according to the Citizens Report, there is a loss of traditional way of life. Thus local communities are being left unemployed and thus indulge in vices such as alcoholism. Finally, taking away of land from local farmers and residents is resulting in their displacement, according to the Citizens Report filed in early 2011.  The Citizens Report was also cited by this [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-03-30/gurgaon/29361393_1_water-table-natural-water-rain-water Times of India] article.

== Environmental Degradation ==
There had to be intervention in this area of the Aravalli Hills simply because there with the advancement of deforestation due to development and the occurrence of "concretizing," as was mentioned in the Citizens Report, the result is [[environmental degradation]]. Thus the goal of afforestation that is on the process of being underway is highly necessary and will be carried near the Maruti Plant located in this area of the Aravalli Hills. The afforestation drive has been partly in motion as was mentioned by this article in the  [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-06/gurgaon/30366007_1_saplings-trees-manesar-industrial-welfare-association Times of India].Furthermore, environmental degradation in this area takes the form of destruction of the natural water supply as was mentioned in the Citizens Report .

==Notable people==
Amina Shervani has been majorly involved with MIWA. She is a woman entrepreneur who has been helped in the drive towards afforestation and the drive towards rainwater harvesting by her husband, Milin Kapoor. The other people involved in MIWA are M.K. Bhargava, Manmohan Gaind, Vikash Gupta and Jagdish Kukreja. According to this article in the [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-07/gurgaon/28365384_1_mapping-project-fertile-land-industrialist Times of India], Amina Shervani is a "member of the association and an industrialist who is  based in Manesar Sector 3." She was one of the key people behind the Citizen's Report that was filed in the Supreme Court in early 2011. This report was filed to emphasize the issue of environmental degradation and social degradation that faced the region of Manesar, namely near the Aravalli Hills.

'''Metaphor identification procedure (MIP)''' is a method for identifying [[metaphor]]ically used words in [[discourse]]. It can be used to recognize metaphors in spoken and written language. Mainly intended for scholars, it can be helpful in empirical research. The procedure aims to determine the relationship of a particular lexical unit in the discourse and recognize its use in a particular [[Context (language use)|context]] as possibly metaphorical. Since many words can be considered metaphorical in different contexts, MIP requires a clear distinction between words that convey metaphorical meaning and those that do not, despite the fact that language generally differs in the degrees of metaphoricity.
A group of scholars called Pragglejaz started the Pragglejaz procedure in 2007, and elaborated on a detailed method of identifying metaphors. Note that this method does not deal with an author's possible intention to express metaphorical meanings, and does not identify metaphorical utterances and conventional linguistic metaphors. It also does not indicate ordinary procedures people use to determine metaphors or exclude other possible non-literalness.

'''Oxhide ingots''' are metal slabs, usually of [[copper]] but sometimes of [[tin]], produced and widely distributed during the [[Mediterranean]] [[Late Bronze Age]] (LBA). Their shape resembles the hide of an ox with a protruding handle in each of the ingot’s four corners. Early thought was that each [[ingot]] was equivalent to the value of one ox.&lt;ref&gt;Cemal Pulak, “The Copper and Tin Ingots from the Late Bronze Age Shipwreck at Uluburun,” ''Anatolian Metal I'', ed. Ünsal Yalçin, (Bochum: Herausgeber, 2000), 138.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the similarity in shape is simply a coincidence. The ingots’ producers probably designed these protrusions to make the ingots easily transportable overland on the backs of [[pack animal]]s.&lt;ref name="Pulak 2000: 140"&gt;Pulak 2000: 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Complete or partial oxhide ingots have been discovered in [[Sardinia]], [[Crete]], [[Peloponnese]], [[Cyprus]], Cannatello in [[Sicily]], Boğazköy in [[Turkey]] (ancient [[Hattusa]], the [[Hittites|Hittite]] capital), Qantir in [[Egypt]] (ancient [[Pi-Ramesses]]), and [[Sozopol]] in [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Muhly, "The Role of Cyprus in the Economy of the Eastern Mediterranean," ''Acts of the International Archaeological Symposium "Cyprus between the Orient and the Occident" Nicosia, 8&amp;ndash;14 Sept. 1985'', ed. V. Karageorghis, (Nicosia: Department of Anitquities, Cyprus, 1986), 55&amp;ndash;6; and Fulvia Lo Schiavo, "Oxhide Ingots in the Mediterranean and Central Europe," ''Archaeometallurgy in Sardinia'', eds. Fulvia Lo Schiavo et al., (Montagnac: Éditions Monique Mergoil, 2005), 307.&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeologists have recovered many oxhide ingots from two shipwrecks off the coast of Turkey (one off Uluburun and one in Cape Gelidonya).

==Context==
The appearance of oxhide ingots in the archaeological record corresponds with the beginning of the bulk copper trade in the Mediterranean—approximately 1600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Muhly et al., "Cyprus, Crete, and Sardinia: Copper Oxhide Ingots and the Bronze Age Metals Trade," ''Report of the Department of Antiquities,'' Cyprus, Part 1 (Nicosia) 1988: 281.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest oxhide ingots found come from Crete and date to the Late [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Minoan chronology|IB]], approximately 1500 BC to 1450 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Zofia A. Stos-Gale and Noël H. Gale, "New Light on the Provenience of the Copper Oxhide Ingots Found on Sardinia," ''Sardinia in the Mediterranean: A Footprint in the Sea'', eds. Robert H. Tykot and Tamsey K. Andrews, (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1992), 322.&lt;/ref&gt; The latest oxhide ingots date to approximately 1000 BC, and were found on Sardinia.&lt;ref&gt;Muhly et al. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; The copper trade was largely maritime: the principal sites where oxhide ingots are found are at sea, on the coast, and on islands.&lt;ref name="Pulak 2000: 138"&gt;Pulak 2000: 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
It is uncertain whether the oxhide ingots served as a form of currency. Ingots found in excavations at [[Mycenae]] are now part of the exhibits of the [[Numismatic Museum of Athens]]. Cemal Pulak argues that the weights of the Uluburun ingots are similar enough to have allowed "a rough but quick reckoning of a given quantity of raw metal prior to weighing".&lt;ref name="Pulak 2000: 138"/&gt; But George Bass proposes, via the Gelidonya ingots, whose weights are approximately the same if somewhat lower than the Uluburun ingot weights, that the weights were not standard and thus the ingots were not a currency.&lt;ref&gt;George F. Bass et al., “Cape Gelidonya: A Bronze Age Shipwreck,” ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' 57 (1967): 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that the oxhide shape, as well as the bun shape that some ingots took, was a visual statement that the ingot at hand is part of a legitimate trade.&lt;ref name="Pulak 2000: 138"/&gt; In Sardinia, oxhide ingot fragments have been found in hoards with bun ingots and scrap metal and, in some cases, in a metallurgical workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliki Kassianidou, "Cypriot Copper in Sardinia: Yet Another Case of Bringing Coals to Newcastle?," ''Archaeometallurgy in Sardinia'', eds. Fulvia Lo Schiavo et al., (Montagnac: Éditions Monique Mergoil, 2005), 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing this evidence, Vasiliki Kassianidou argues that the oxhide ingots "were meant to be used rather than to be kept as prestige goods".&lt;ref&gt;Kassianidou 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major finds==
===Uluburun shipwreck===
{{main|Uluburun shipwreck}}
In 1982, a diver discovered a shipwreck off the shore of Uluburun, Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Cemal Pulak, "The Uluburun Shipwreck," ''The Ship of Uluburun'', trans. Ünsal Yalçin, (Bochum: Deutsches Bergbau-Museum, 2006), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship contained 317 copper ingots in the normal oxhide shape, 36 with only two corner protrusions, 121 shaped like buns, and five shaped like pillows.&lt;ref&gt;George F. Bass, "A Bronze Age Shipwreck at Ulu Burun (Kaş)," ''American Journal of Archaeology'', 90 (1986): 276; Pulak 2000: 141; and Andreas Hauptmann et al., “On the Structure and Composition of Copper and Tin Ingots Excavated from the Shipwreck of Uluburun,” ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'', 328 (2002): 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The oxhide ingots (ingots with two or four protrusions) range in weight from 20.1 to 29.5&amp;nbsp;kg after being cleaned of their corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;Pulak 2000: 141&lt;/ref&gt; These ingots were found stacked in four rows following a herringbone pattern.&lt;ref name="Pulak 2000: 140"/&gt; The smooth sides of the ingots faced downwards, and the lowest layer rested on brushwood.&lt;ref&gt;Pulak 2000: 140&amp;ndash;141.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three whole tin oxhide ingots, and there are many tin ingots cut into quarters or halves, with their corner protrusion(s) still intact.&lt;ref&gt;Pulak 2000: 150&amp;ndash;151.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides metal ingots, the cargo included ivory, metal jewelry, and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]], Cypriot, and [[Canaan]]ite pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Bass 1986: 274.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dendrochronology|Tree-ring dating]] of firewood from the ship gives an approximate date of 1300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Pulak 2000: 137.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 160 copper oxhide ingots, 62 bun ingots, and some of the tin oxhide ingots have incised marks typically on their rough sides.&lt;ref name="Pulak 2000: 146"&gt;Pulak 2000: 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these marks—resembling fish, oars, and boats—relate to the sea, and they were probably incised after casting, when the ingot was received or exported.&lt;ref name="Pulak 2000: 146"/&gt;

Recently Yuval Goren proposed that the ten tons of copper ingots, one ton of tin ingots, and the resin stored in the Canaanite jars aboard the ship were one complete package. The recipients of the copper, tin, and resin would have used these materials for bronze casting through the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax technique]].&lt;ref&gt;Yuval Goren, "International Exchange in the Eastern Mediterranean: Food and Ships, Sealing-Wax and Kings as Seen Under the Petrographic Microscope," Institute of Archaeology Kenyon Lecture, London, 13 Nov. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cape Gelidonya shipwreck===
In the early 1950s, divers found the remains of a shipwreck in [[Cape Gelidonya]], off the coast of Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Bass et al. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains included a substantial amount of copper oxhide ingot material: 34 in full, five in half, 12 corners, and 75&amp;nbsp;kg of random fragments.&lt;ref name="Bass et al. 52"&gt;Bass et al. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four full copper oxhide ingots have stamps on their centers—usually of a circle containing intersecting lines.&lt;ref name="Bass et al. 52"/&gt; These stamps were likely made when the metal was soft.&lt;ref name="Bass et al. 52"/&gt; In addition, the ship contained numerous complete and incomplete copper bun-shaped ingots, rectangular tin bars, and Cypriot agricultural tools made of scrap bronze.&lt;ref&gt;George F. Bass, "Bronze Age Shipwrecks on the Eastern Mediterranean," ''The Ship of Uluburun'', trans. Ünsal Yalçin, (Bochum: Deutsches Bergbau-Museum, 2006), 3; and Bass et al. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating]] of brushwood from the ship gives an approximate date of 1200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bass et al. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and microstructure==
Typically the copper oxhide ingots are highly pure (approximately 99 weight percent copper) with [[trace element]] content of less than one weight percent.&lt;ref&gt;Hauptmann et al. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The few tin oxhide ingots that have been available to study are also exceptionally pure.&lt;ref&gt;Hauptmann et al. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Microscopic analysis of the Uluburun copper oxhide ingots reveals that they are highly porous.&lt;ref name="Hauptmann et al. 4"&gt;Hauptmann et al. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This feature results from the [[Effervescence (chemistry)|effervescence]] of gases as the molten metal cooled.&lt;ref name="Hauptmann et al. 4"/&gt; [[Slag]] inclusions are also present.&lt;ref&gt;Hauptmann et al. 6&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt; Their existence implies that slag was not fully removed from the [[smelting|smelted]] metal and thus that the ingots were made from remelted copper.&lt;ref&gt;Hauptmann et al. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Macroscopic observation of the Uluburun copper ingots indicates that they were cast through multiple pours; there are distinct layers of metal in each ingot.&lt;ref&gt;Pulak 2000: 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the relatively high weight and high purity of the ingots would be difficult to achieve even today in only one pour.&lt;ref&gt;John Merkel, "Ancient Smelting and Casting of Copper for 'Oxhide' Ingots," ''Studies in Sardinian Archaeology'', Volume II, ed. Miriam S. Balmuth, (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1986), 260; and Muhly et al. 287&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The porosity of the copper ingots and the natural brittleness of tin suggest that both metal ingots were easy to break.&lt;ref&gt;Hauptmann et al. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; As Bass et al. proposes, a metalsmith could simply break off a piece of the ingot whenever he liked for a new casting.&lt;ref&gt;Bass et al. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Controversy has swirled around the [[provenance]] of the copper oxhide ingots. Lead [[isotope]] analysis (LIA) suggests that the late LBA ingots (that is, after 1250 BC) are composed of Cypriot copper, specifically copper from the Apilki mine and its surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;Z.A. Stos-Gale et al., “Lead Isotope Characteristics of the Cyprus Copper Ore Deposits Applied to Provenance Studies of Copper Oxhide Ingots,” ''Archaeometry'' '''39''' (1997): 107, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gelidonya ingots’ ratios are consistent with Cypriot ores while the Uluburun ingots fall on the periphery of the Cypriot isotopic field.&lt;ref&gt;Pulak 2006: 9.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Late Minoan I ingots found on Crete have [[Paleozoic]] lead isotope ratios and are more consistent with ore sources in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], or [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Stos-Gale et al. 1997: 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy settles on the validity of LIA. Paul Budd argues that LBA copper is the product of such extensive mixing and recycling that LIA, which works best for metals from a single ore deposit, is unfeasible.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Muhly, "Copper and Bronze in the Late Bronze Aegean," ''The Ship of Uluburun'', trans. Ünsal Yalçin, (Bochum: Deutsches Bergbau-Museum, 2006), 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars worry that the 1250 BC date is too limiting. They note that Cyprus was smelting copper on a large scale in the early LBA and had the potential to export the metal to Crete and other places at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Kassianidou 334; and Muhly et al. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, copper ore is more plentiful on Cyprus than on Sardinia and far more plentiful than on Crete.&lt;ref&gt;Stos-Gale and Gale 1992: 320&amp;ndash;321.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have discovered numerous Cypriot exports to Sardinia including metalworking tools and prestige metal objects.&lt;ref&gt;Fulvia Lo Schiavo, "Cyprus and Sardinia," ''Archaeometallurgy in Sardinia'', eds. Fulvia Lo Schiavo et al., (Montagnac: Éditions Monique Mergoil, 2005), 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the heavy [[corrosion]] of tin oxhide ingots and the limited data for lead isotopic studies of tin, the provenance of the tin ingots has been uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Pulak 2006: 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that scholars have been unable to pinpoint Bronze Age tin ore deposits compounds this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Pulak 2006: 11&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molds==
A [[Molding (process)|mold]] for casting an oxhide ingot was discovered in the LBA north palace at [[Ras Ibn Hani]] in [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul T. Craddock et al., "Casting Metals in Limestone Moulds," ''The Journal of the Historical Metallurgy Society'', 31 (1997): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of fine-grained “ramleh,” a “shelly” [[limestone]].&lt;ref name="Craddock et al. 4"&gt;Craddock et al. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists found burnt copper droplets around the mold.&lt;ref name="Craddock et al. 4"/&gt; In spite of the questionable durability of limestone, Paul Craddock et al. concluded that limestone can be used for casting “large simple shapes” such as oxhide ingots.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock et al. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution of carbon dioxide from the limestone would damage the metal surface that touched the mold.&lt;ref name="Craddock et al. 6"&gt;Craddock et al. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, metal objects requiring surface detail could not be produced successfully.&lt;ref name="Craddock et al. 6"/&gt;

This is not to say that oxhide ingots were normally cast in limestone molds. Using an [[Experimental archaeology|experimental]] clay mold, Bass et al. argue that the ingot's smooth side was in contact with the mold while its rough side was exposed to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Bass et al. 70"&gt;Bass et al. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The roughness results from the interaction of the atmosphere and the cooling metal.&lt;ref name="Bass et al. 70"/&gt;

==Bronze stands with oxhide ingot depictions==
In the Late Bronze Age, Cyprus produced numerous bronze stands that depicted a man carrying an oxhide ingot. The stands were designed to hold vases, and they were cast through the lost-wax process.&lt;ref&gt;Vassos Karageorghis and George Papasawas, "A Bronze Ingot-Bearer from Cyprus," [[Oxford Journal of Archaeology]] 20 (2001): 341, 344.&lt;/ref&gt; The ingots show the familiar shape of four protruding handles, and the men carry them over their shoulders. These Cypriot stands were exported to Crete and Sardinia, and both islands created similar stands in local bronze workshops.&lt;ref&gt;Karageorghis and Papasawas 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egyptian connections==
While only one oxhide ingot fragment has been recovered from Egypt (in the context of a LBA smelting workshop), there is a wide array of painted scenes in Egypt that show oxhide ingots. The earliest scene dates to the 15th century BC and the latest scene to the 12th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bass et al. 62, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The ingots display their typical four protrusions, and red paint (which suggests they are copper) is preserved on them.&lt;ref name="Bass et al. 62&amp;ndash;67"&gt;Bass et al. 62&amp;ndash;67.&lt;/ref&gt; The captions accompanying the scenes explain that the men who bring the ingots come from the north, specifically [[Retjenu|Retnu]] (Syria) and [[Caphtor|Keftiu]] (unidentified).&lt;ref name="Bass et al. 62&amp;ndash;67"/&gt; They are shown being carried on the shoulders of men, sitting with other goods in storage, or as part of scenes in smelting workshops.&lt;ref name="Bass et al. 62&amp;ndash;67"/&gt; In a relief from [[Karnak]], the pharaoh [[Amenhotep II]] is seen riding a [[chariot]] and spearing an oxhide ingot with five arrows. A laudatory caption emphasizing the pharaoh’s strength accompanies the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Bass et al. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the “[[Amarna letters]]” dating to the mid-14th century BC refer to hundreds of copper talents—in addition to goods such as elephant tusks and glass ingots—sent from the kingdom of [[Alashiya]] to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Muhly et al. 293; and Pulak 2000: 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars identify Cyprus with Alashiya.&lt;ref&gt;Muhly et al. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the Uluburun cargo is similar to the goods that, according to the letters, Alashiya sent to Egypt.&lt;ref name="Pulak 2000: 140"/&gt;

[[Image:Zeitschriften.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Consumer]] [[magazine]] sponsored [[advertisement]]s and covers rely heavily on professional page layout skills to compete for visual attention.]]
'''Page layout''' is the part of [[graphic design]] that deals in the arrangement of visual elements on a [[Page (paper)|page]]. It generally involves organizational principles of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] to achieve specific communication objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Z|title=Elements and principles of design: Tools for digital imagery, art and design|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-level page layout involves deciding on the overall arrangement of text and images, and possibly on the size or shape of the medium.  It requires intelligence, sentience, and creativity, and is informed by culture, psychology, and what the document authors and editors wish to communicate and emphasize.  Low-level [[pagination]] and [[typesetting]] are more mechanical processes.  Given certain parameters - boundaries of text areas, the typeface, font size, and justification preference can be done in a straightforward way.  Until desktop publishing became dominant, these processes were still done by people, but in modern publishing they are almost always [[automation|automated]].  The result might be published as-is (as for a residential [[telephone directory|phone book]] interior) or might be tweaked by a graphic designer (as for a highly polished, expensive publication) it is very important as it allows you to read a [[Magazine]].

Beginning from early [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] pages in hand-copied books of the [[Middle Ages]] and proceeding down to intricate modern magazine and catalog layouts, proper page design has long been a consideration in printed material. With print media, elements usually consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and occasionally place-holder graphics for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].

== History and layout technologies ==

==={{anchor|Direct physical layout|Page setting}}Direct physical page setting===

With [[manuscript]]s, all of the elements are added by hand, so the creator can determine the layout directly as they create the work, perhaps with an advance sketch as a guide.

With ancient [[woodblock printing]], all elements of the page were carved directly into wood, though later layout decisions might need to be made if the printing was transferred onto a larger work, such as a large piece of fabric, potentially with multiple block impressions.

With the Renaissance invention of [[letterpress printing]] and cold-metal [[moveable type]], [[typesetting]] was accomplished by physically assembling characters using a [[composing stick]] into a galley—a long tray.  Any images would be created by [[engraving]].

The original document would be a hand-written manuscript; if the typesetting was performed by someone other than the layout artist, [[markup language|markup]] would be added to the manuscript with instructions as to typeface, font size, and so on. (Even after authors began to use typewriters in the 1860s, originals were still called "manuscripts" and the markup process was the same.)

After the first round of typesetting, a [[galley proof]] might be printed in order for [[proofreading]] to be performed, either to correct errors in the original, or to make sure that the typesetter had copied the manuscript properly, and correctly interpreted the markup.  The final layout would be constructed in a "form" or "forme" using pieces of wood or metal ("[[Furniture (typesetting)|furniture]]") to space out the text and images as desired, a frame known as a [[Chase (typesetting)|chase]], and objects which lock down the frame known as [[quoins]].  This process is called [[imposition]], and potentially includes arranging multiple pages to be printed on the same sheet of paper which will later be folded and possibly trimmed.  An "imposition proof" (essentially a short run of the press) might be created to check the final placement.

The invention of [[hot metal typesetting]] in 1884 sped up the typesetting process by allowing workers to produce [[Slug (typesetting)|slugs]]—entire lines of text—using a keyboard.  The slugs were the result of molten metal being poured into molds temporarily assembled by the typesetting machine.  The layout process remained the same as with cold metal type, however: assembly into physical galleys.

===Paste-up era===
[[File:Editorial_office_of_Bild_newspaper,_West_Berlin,_1977.jpg|thumb|right|[[Editor#Print media|Editors]] work on producing an issue of ''[[Bild]],'' 1977 in [[West Berlin]]. Previous front pages are affixed to the wall behind them. ]]
[[Offset lithography]] allows the bright and dark areas of an image (at first captured on film) to control ink placement on the printing press.  This means that if a single copy of the page can be created on paper and photographed, then any number of copies could be printed.  Type could be set with a [[typewriter]], or to achieve professional results comparable to letterpress, a specialized typesetting machine.  The [[IBM Selectric Composer]], for example, could produce type of different size, different fonts (including [[proportional font]]s), and with [[text justification]].  With [[photoengraving]] and [[halftone]], physical photographs could be transferred into print directly, rather than relying on hand-made engravings.

The layout process then became the task of creating the [[paste up]], so named because [[rubber cement]] or other adhesive would be used to physically paste images and columns of text onto a rigid sheet of paper.  Completed pages become known as [[camera-ready]], "mechanical" or "mechanical art".

[[Phototypesetting]] was invented in 1945; after keyboard input, characters were shot one-by-one onto a photographic negative, which could then be sent to the print shop directly, or shot onto photographic paper for paste-up.  These machines became increasingly sophisticated, with computer-driven models able to store text on magnetic tape.

=== Computer-aided publishing ===

As the graphics capabilities of computers matured, they began to be used to render characters, columns, pages, and even multi-page [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|signatures]] directly, rather than simply summoning a photographic template from a pre-supplied set.  In addition to being used as display devices for computer operators, [[cathode ray tube]]s were used to render text for phototypesetting. The curved nature of the CRT display however, led to distortions of text and art on the screen towards the outer edges of the screens. The advent of "flat screen" monitors (LCD, LED, and more recently OLED) in early 2010 eliminated the distortion problems caused by older CRT displays. As of 2016 flat panel displays have almost completely replaced CRT displays.&lt;ref&gt;[[Flat panel display]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}}

[[Printer (computing)|Printers]] attached directly to computers allowed them to print documents directly, in multiple copies or as an original which could be copied on a [[ditto machine]] or [[photocopier]]. [[WYSIWYG]] [[word processor]]s made it possible for general office users and consumers to make more sophisticated page layouts, use text justification, and use more fonts than were possible with typewriters.  Early [[dot matrix printing]] was sufficient for office documents, but was of too low a quality for professional typesetting. [[Inkjet printing]] and [[laser printing]] did produce sufficient quality type, and so computers with these types of printers quickly replaced phototypesetting machines.

With modern [[desktop publishing]] software such as flagship software [[Adobe Indesign]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html|title=Buy Adobe InDesign CC - Desktop publishing software and online publisher|author=|date=|website=www.adobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cloud-based [[Lucidpress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lucidpress.com/pages/tour/free-page-layout-software|title=Free Page Layout Software|author=|date=26 May 2015|website=lucidpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the layout process can occur entirely on-screen.  (Similar layout options that would be available to a professional print shop making a paste-up are supported by desktop publishing software; in contrast, "word processing" software usually has a much more limited set of layout and typography choices available, trading off flexibility for ease of use for more common applications.)  A finished document can be directly printed as the camera-ready version, with no physical assembly required (given a big enough printer).  Greyscale images must be either half toned digitally if being sent to an offset press, or sent separately for the print shop to insert into marked areas.  Completed works can also be transmitted digitally to the print shop, who may print it themselves, shoot it directly to film, or use [[computer to plate]] technology to skip the physical original entirely. [[PostScript]] and [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) have become standard file formats for digital transmission.

===Digital media (non-paper)===

Since the advent of [[personal computing]], page layout skills have expanded to [[electronic media]] as well as print media. [[E-book]]s, PDF documents, and static [[web page]]s mirror paper documents relatively closely, but computers can also add [[multimedia]] animation, and interactivity.  Page layout for [[interactive media]] overlaps with [[interface design]] and [[user experience]] design; an interactive "page" is better known as a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).

Modern web pages are typically produced using [[HTML]] for content and general structure, [[cascading style sheet]]s to control presentation details such as typography and spacing, and [[JavaScript]] for interactivity.  Since these languages are all text-based, this work can be done in a [[text editor]], or a special [[HTML editor]] which may have WYSIWYG features or other aids.  Additional technologies such as [[Macromedia Flash]] may be used for multimedia content. [[Web developer]]s are responsible for actually creating a finished document using these technologies, but a separate [[web designer]] may be responsible for establishing the layout.  A given web designer might be a fluent web developer as well, or may merely be familiar with the general capabilities of the technologies and merely visualize the desired result for the development team.

===Projected pages===

Projected slides used in presentations or entertainment often have similar layout considerations to printed pages.

The [[magic lantern]] and [[opaque projector]] were used during lectures in the 1800s, using printed, typed, photographed, or hand-drawn originals. Two sets of [[photographic film]] (one negative and one positive) or one [[reversal film]] can be used to create positive images that can be projected with light passing through. [[Intertitle]]s were used extensively in the earliest [[motion picture]]s when sound was not available; they are still used occasionally in addition to the ubiquitous [[vanity card]]s and [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]].

It became popular to use transparent film for presentations (with opaque text and images) using [[overhead projector]]s in the 1940s, and [[slide projector]]s in the 1950s. [[Transparency (projection)|Transparencies]] for overhead projectors could be printed by some photocopiers.  Computer [[presentation program]]s became available in the 1980s, making it possible to lay out a presentation digitally.  Computer-developed presentations could be printed to a transparency with some laser printers, transferred to slides, or projected directly using [[LCD]] overhead projectors.  Modern presentations are often displayed digitally using a [[video projector]], [[computer monitor]], or [[Large-screen television technology|large-screen television]].

Laying out a [[presentation]] presents slightly different challenges than a print document, especially because a person will typically be speaking and referring to the projected pages.  Consideration might be given to:
* Sizing text and graphics so they can be seen from the back of the room, which limits the amount of information that can be presented on a single slide
* Using headers, footers, or repeated elements to make all pages similar so they feel cohesive, or indicate progress
* Using titles to introduce new topics or segments
* Pacing, so slides are changed at comfortable intervals, fit the length of the talk, and content order matches the speaker's expectation
* Providing a way for the speaker to refer to specific items on the page, such as with color, verbal labels, or a [[laser pointer]]
* Editing the information presented so it either repeats what the speaker is saying (so the audience can pay attention to either) or only presents information that cannot be conveyed verbally (to avoid dividing audience attention or simply reading slides directly)
* Use of animation to add emphasis, introduce information slowly, or be entertaining
* Making the slides useful for later reference if printed as handouts or posted online

== Grids versus templates ==
[[Grid (page layout)|Grid]]s and templates are page layout design patterns used in [[advertising campaign]]s and multiple-page publications, including [[website]]s.

A '''grid''' is a set of guidelines, able to be seen in the design process and invisible to the end-user/audience, for aligning and repeating elements on a page. A page layout may or may not stay within those guidelines, depending on how much repetition or variety the design style in the series calls for. Grids are meant to be flexible. Using a grid to lay out elements on the page may require just as much or more graphic design skill than that which was required to design the grid.

In contrast, a '''template''' is more rigid.  A template involves repeated elements mostly visible to the end-user/audience. Using a template to lay out elements usually involves less graphic design skill than that which was required to design the template. Templates are used for minimal modification of background elements and frequent modification (or swapping) of foreground content.

Most desktop publishing software allows for grids in the form of a page filled with coloured lines or dots placed at a specified equal horizontal and vertical distance apart. Automatic margins and booklet spine (gutter) lines may be specified for global use throughout the document. Multiple additional horizontal and vertical lines may be placed at any point on the page. Invisible to the end-user/audience shapes may be placed on the page as guidelines for page layout and print processing as well. Software templates are achieved by duplicating a template data file, or with [[Desktop publishing#Terminology|master page]] features in a multiple-page document. Master pages may include both grid elements and template elements such as header and footer elements, automatic page numbering, and automatic table of contents features.

==Static versus dynamic layouts==
Static layouts allow for more control over the [[aesthetics]], and thorough optimization of space around and overlapping irregular-shaped content than dynamic layouts. In [[web design]], this is sometimes referred to as a fixed width layout; but the entire layout may be scalable in size while still maintaining the original proportions, static placement, and style of the content. All [[Image file formats#Raster formats|raster image formats]] are static layouts in effect; but a static layout may include searchable text by separating the text from the graphics.

In contrast, electronic pages allow for [[dynamic publishing|dynamic layouts]] with swapping content, [[personalization]] of styles, text scaling, [[image scaling]], or [[reflowable document|reflowable]] content with variable page sizes often referred to as fluid or liquid layout. Dynamic layouts are more likely to [[separation of presentation and content|separate presentation from content]], which comes with its own advantages. A dynamic layout lays out all text and images into rectangular areas of rows and columns. As these areas' widths and heights are defined to be percentages of the available screen, they are responsive to varying screen dimensions. They'll automatically ensure maximized use of available space while always staying adapted optimally both on screen resizes and hardware-given restrictions. Text may freely be resized to provide users' individual needs on legibility while never disturbing a given layout's proportions. The content's overall arrangement on screen this way may always remain as it was originally designed.

Static layout design may involve more graphic design and [[visual art]] skills, whereas dynamic layout design may involve more [[interactive design]] and [[content management]] skills to thoroughly anticipate content variation.

[[Motion graphics]] don't fit neatly into either category, but may involve layout skills or careful consideration of how the motion may affect the layout. In either case, the element of motion makes it a dynamic layout, but one that warrants [[motion graphic design]] more than static graphic design or interactive design.

Electronic pages may utilize both static and dynamic layout features by dividing the pages or by combining the effects. For example, a section of the page such as a [[web banner]] may contain static or motion graphics contained within a swapping content area. Dynamic or live text may be wrapped around irregular shaped images by using invisible spacers to push the text away from the edges. Some computer algorithms can detect the edges of an object that contain [[transparency (graphic)|transparency]] and flow content around contours.

==Front-end versus back-end==
With modern media content retrieval and output technology, there is much overlap between [[visual communication]]s ('''front-end''') and [[information technology]] ('''back-end'''). Large print publications (thick books, especially instructional in nature) and electronic pages (web pages) require [[meta data]] for automatic indexing, automatic reformatting, database publishing, dynamic page display and end-user interactivity. Much of the meta data ([[meta tags]]) must be hand coded or specified during the page layout process. This divides the task of page layout between artists and engineers, or tasks the artist/engineer to do both.

More complex projects may require two separate designs: page layout design as the [[front and back ends|front-end]], and function coding as the back-end. In this case, the front-end may be designed using an alternative page layout technology such as [[image editing software]] or on paper with hand rendering methods. Most image editing software includes features for converting a page layout for use in a "What You See Is What You Get" ([[WYSIWYG]]) editor or features to export graphics for desktop publishing software. WYSIWYG editors and desktop publishing software allow front-end design prior to back-end coding in most cases. Interface design and database publishing may involve more technical knowledge or collaboration with information technology engineering in the front-end. Sometimes, a function on the back-end is to automate the retrieval and arrangement of content on the front-end.

==Design elements and choices==

Page layout might be prescribed to a greater or lesser degree by a [[Style guide|house style]] which might be implemented in a specific desktop publishing template.  There might also be relatively little layout to do in comparison to the amount of pagination (as in novels and other books with no figures).

Typical page layout decisions include:
* Size of page [[Margin (typography)|margins]]
* Size and position of images and figures
* Deciding on the number and size of [[Column (typography)|columns]] and gutters (gaps between columns)
* Placement of intentional [[White space (visual arts)|whitespace]]
* Use of special effects like overlaying text on an image, [[Runaround (typography)|runaround]] and intrusions, or [[Bleed (printing)|bleeding]] an image over the page margin
* Use of [[color printing]] or [[spot color]] for emphasis

Specific elements to be laid out might include:
* Chapter or section titles, or [[headline]]s and [[subhead]]s
* [[Photo caption|Image captions]]
* [[Pull quote]]s and [[nut graph]]s which might be added out of course or to make a short story fit the layout
* [[Boxout]]s and [[Sidebar (publishing)|sidebars]], which present information as asides from the main text flow
* [[Page header]]s and [[page footer]]s, the contents of which are usually uniform across content pages and thus automatically duplicated by layout software.  The [[page number]] is usually included in the header or footer, and software automatically increments it for each page.
* [[Table of contents]]
* [[Note (typography)|Notes]] like footnotes and end notes; [[bibliography]], for example in academic journals or textbooks

In newspaper production, final selection and [[Cropping (image)|cropping]] of photographs accompanying stories might be left to the layout editor (since the choice of photo could affect the shape of the area needed, and thus the rest of the layout), or there might be a separate photo editor.  Likewise, [[headline]]s might be written by the layout editor, a [[copy editor]], or the original author.

To make stories fit the final layout, relatively inconsequential copy tweaks might be made (for example, rephrasing for brevity), or the layout editor might make slight adjustments to [[typography]] elements like [[font size]] or [[leading]].

===Floating block===
A floating block in [[writing]] and [[publishing]] is any graphic, text, table, or other representation that is unaligned from the main flow of text. Use of floating blocks to present pictures and [[table (information)|table]]s is a typical feature of [[academic writing]] and [[technical writing]], including scientific articles and books. Floating blocks are normally labeled with a caption or title that describes its contents and a number that is used to refer to the figure from the main text. A common system divides floating block into two separately numbered series, labeled ''figure'' (for pictures, diagrams, [[Plot (graphics)|plots]], etc.) and ''table''.  An alternative name for figure is '''image''' or '''graphic'''.

Floating blocks are said to be ''floating'' because they are not fixed in position on the page at the place, but rather drift to the side of the page.  By placing pictures or other large items on the sides of pages&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HQcFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA2 ''New Perspectives on JavaScript and AJAX, Comprehensive'']. p. VS-B2.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than embedding them in the middle of the main flow of text, [[typesetting]] is more flexible and interruption to the flow of the narrative is avoided.

For example, an article on [[geography]] might have "Figure 1: Map of the world", "Figure 2: Map of Europe", "Table 1: Population of continents", "Table 2: Population of European countries", and so on. Some books will have a table of figures—in addition to the [[table of contents]]—that lists centrally all the figures appearing in the work.

Other kinds of floating blocks may be differentiated as well, for example:

: Sidebar:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u-I0_7Utu58C&amp;pg=PT406 ''Sams Teach Yourself Dreamweaver CS5 in 24 Hours'']. p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; For digressions from the main narrative. For example, a technical manual on usage of a product might include examples of how various people have employed the product in their work in sidebars. Also called an ''intermezzo''. See [[sidebar (publishing)]].
: Program: Articles and books on [[computer programming]] often place code and [[algorithms]] in a figure.
: Equation: Writing on [[mathematics]] may place large blocks of mathematical notation in numbered blocks set apart from the main text.

==Presenting layouts under development==

A [[mockup]] of a layout might be created to get early feedback, usually before all the content is actually ready.  Whether for paper or electronic media, the first draft of a layout might be simply a rough paper and pencil sketch.  A [[comprehensive layout]] for a new magazine might show placeholders for text and images, but demonstrate placement, typographic style, and other idioms intended to set the pattern for actual issues, or a particular unfinished issue.  A [[website wireframe]] is a low-cost way to show layout without doing all the work of creating the final HTML and CSS, and without writing the copy or creating any images.

[[Lorem ipsum]] text is often used to avoid the embarrassment any improvised sample copy might cause if accidentally published.  Likewise, placeholder images are often labelled "[[for position only]]".

In stage magic '''Psychomagic''' is accredited to [[Chan Canasta]] by many [[Illusionist|magicians]] and [[mentalists]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Canasta was a pioneer in the 1950s and 1960s of [[mentalism]]. He explained that the word was a [[portmanteau]] of the two words [[psychology]] and [[Magical thinking|magic]], much like his performances, which are considered by many to be an early form of [[Psychological Magic]].{{Attribution needed|date=March 2010}}

There are many entertainers and performers who still perform this type of 'mind magic' all over the world, often referring to themselves as psychological entertainers/illusionists or mind magicians. These performers include; [[Derren Brown]], [[Max Maven]], [[Marc Paul]], [[Twig Harper]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1885">The '''Religious Experience Research Centre''' was founded by the distinguished marine biologist Professor [[Alister Hardy]] FRS in 1969 as The Religious Experience Research Unit. He and his co-researchers began to gather a unique archive of accounts of [[religious experience]] and to publish research into the area. The maintenance of both the archives and the research and publications have continued. The Centre organises conferences and produces both books and a series of Occasional Papers on religious experience and spirituality.

Sir Alister was awarded the ''[[Templeton Prize]] for Progress In Religion'' in 1985 and the Centre has since received a grant from the Templeton Foundation for the computerisation of the archives. The Centre was located at [[Manchester College, Oxford]] from 1969-1989 and from 1989–1999 at [[Westminster College, Oxford]]. In 2000 the Centre moved to the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]]
(presently University of Wales, Trinity Saint David). 

The directors of the Centre are currently Greg Barker, Bettina Schmidt and Sally Wilkinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/lrc/librariesandcentres/alisterhardyreligiousexperienceresearchcentre/contacts/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328113909/http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/lrc/librariesandcentres/alisterhardyreligiousexperienceresearchcentre/contacts/ |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roaring Twenties''' refers to the decade of the 1920s in [[Western world|Western society]] and [[Western culture]]. It was a period of economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the United States and [[Western Europe]], particularly in major cities such as [[1920s Berlin|Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Anton Gill, ''A Dance Between Flames: Berlin Between the Wars'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;Marc Moscato, ''Brains, Brilliancy, Bohemia: Art &amp; Politics in Jazz-Age Chicago'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;Lesley A. Hall,  "Impotent ghosts from no man's land, flappers' boyfriends, or crypto‐patriarchs? Men, sex and social change in 1920s Britain." ''Social History'' 21#1 (1996): 54–70&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref&gt;David Robinson, ''Hollywood in the Twenties'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Miller, ''Supreme City: How jazz age Manhattan gave birth to modern America'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;Jody Blake, ''Le Tumulte Noir: modernist art and popular entertainment in jazz-age Paris, 1900–1930'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Lindsay, ''The roaring twenties: literary life in Sydney, New South Wales in the years 1921-6'' (1960)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[French Third Republic|France]], the decade was known as the "''[[années folles]]''" ('crazy years'),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wYfyNV5FUQEC&amp;pg=PA195|title=150 Years of Popular Musical Theatre|year=2000|page=195|author=Andrew Lamb|isbn=978-0-300-07538-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the era's social, artistic and cultural dynamism. [[Jazz]] blossomed, the [[flapper]] redefined the modern look for British and American women,&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Horn, ''Flappers: The Real Lives of British Women in the Era of the Great Gatsby'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angela J. Latham, ''Posing a Threat: Flappers, Chorus Girls, and Other Brazen Performers of the American 1920s'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Art Deco]] peaked.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Ginsburg, ''Paris fashions: the art deco style of the 1920s'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Not everything roared: in the wake of the hyper-emotional [[patriotism]] of [[World War I]], [[Warren G. Harding]] "[[Return to normalcy|brought back normalcy]]" to the [[politics of the United States]]. This period saw the large-scale development and use of automobiles, telephones, [[motion pictures]], radio, and electrical appliances. Aviation became a business. Nations saw rapid industrial and economic growth, accelerated consumer demand, and significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media focused on [[Celebrity|celebrities]], especially [[sports]] heroes and [[movie star]]s, as cities rooted for their home teams and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic sports stadiums. In most major [[Democracy|democratic states]], [[Timeline of women's suffrage|women won the right to vote]].

The social and cultural features known as the Roaring Twenties began in leading metropolitan centers, then spread widely in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The United States gained dominance in world finance. Thus, when [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] could no longer afford to pay [[World War I reparations]] to the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and the other Allied powers, the United States came up with the [[Dawes Plan]], named after banker, and later 30th [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[Charles G. Dawes]]. [[Wall Street]] invested heavily in Germany, which paid its reparations to countries that, in turn, used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington. By the middle of the decade, prosperity was widespread, with the second half of the decade known, especially in Germany, as the "[[Golden Twenties]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bärbel Schrader, and Jürgen Schebera. ''The" golden" twenties: art and literature in the Weimar Republic'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of [[novelty]] associated with [[modernity]] and a break with [[tradition]]. Everything seemed to be feasible through modern [[technology]]. New technologies, especially [[Car|automobiles]], [[Film|moving pictures]], and [[radio]], brought  "modernity" to a large part of the population. Formal decorative frills were shed in favor of [[Pragmatism|practicality]] in both daily life and architecture. At the same time, jazz and dancing rose in popularity, in opposition to the mood of World War I. As such, the period is also often referred to as the [[Jazz Age]].

The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] ended the era, as the [[Great Depression]] brought years of hardship worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nOALhEZkYDkC&amp;pg=PA12|title=A Low Dishonest Decade: The Great Powers, Eastern Europe, and the Economic Origins of World War II, 1930–1941|publisher=Continuum|year=2005|page=12|author=Paul N. Hehn|isbn=978-0-8264-1761-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
[[File:PIBUSA1920-40.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PIBUSA1920-40.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Chart 1: USA GDP annual pattern and long-term trend, 1920–1940, in billions of constant dollars&lt;ref&gt;Based on data in Susan Carter, ed. ''Historical Statistics of the US: Millennial Edition'' (2006) series Ca9&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Roaring Twenties was a decade of economic growth and widespread prosperity, driven by recovery from wartime devastation and deferred spending, a boom in construction, and the rapid growth of [[Final good|consumer goods]] such as [[Car|automobiles]] and [[electricity]] in North America and Western Europe and a few other developed countries such as Australia. The [[economy of the United States]], which had successfully transitioned from a [[War economy|wartime economy]] to a peacetime economy, [[Business cycle|boomed]] and provided loans for a European boom as well. Some sectors [[Economic stagnation|stagnated]], especially farming and coal mining. The US became the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|richest country]] in the world per capita and since the late-19th century had been the largest in total GDP. Its industry was based on [[mass production]], and its society acculturated into [[consumerism]]. [[Economic history of Europe|European economies]], by contrast, had a more difficult postwar readjustment and did not begin to flourish until about 1924.&lt;ref name=Soule-1947&gt;George H. Soule, ''Prosperity Decade: From War to Depression: 1917–1929'' (1947)&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the end of wartime production caused a brief but deep recession, the [[post–World War I recession]] of 1919–20. Quickly, however, the US and [[Economy of Canada|Canadian economies]] rebounded as returning soldiers re-entered the labor force and munitions factories were retooled to produce consumer goods.

=== New products and technologies ===
[[Mass production]] made technology affordable to the middle class.&lt;ref name=Soule-1947/&gt;

==== Automobiles ====
{{Further|Cars in the 1920s}} 
The [[automotive industry]], the [[film industry]], the [[radio industry]], and the [[chemical industry]] took off during the 1920s. Of chief importance was the automotive industry. Before the war, cars were a [[Luxury goods|luxury good]]. In the 1920s, mass-produced vehicles became commonplace in the US and Canada. By 1927, the [[Ford Motor Company]] discontinued the [[Ford Model T]] after selling 15 million units of that model. It had been in continuous production from October 1908 to May 1927.&lt;ref name="Ford Motors"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Model T Facts|publisher=Ford|location=US|url=https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2013/08/05/model-t-facts.html|accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/10-moments-made-american-business|title=10 Moments That Made American Business| date=2007-03-01|website=American Heritage|accessdate=2012-12-24|author=John Steele Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company planned to replace the old model with a newer one, the [[Ford Model A (1927–31)|Ford Model A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=189&amp;category=business|title=Michigan History|work=Detroit News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710135903/http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=189&amp;category=business|archivedate=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was a reaction to competition. Due to the commercial success of the Model T, Ford had  dominated the automotive market from the mid-1910s to the early-1920s. In the mid-1920s, Ford's dominance eroded as its competitors had caught up with Ford's mass production system. They began to surpass Ford in some areas, offering models with more powerful engines, new convenience features, and styling.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp217-219"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=217–219}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984pp263-264"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=263–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sloan1964pp162-163"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sloan|1964|pp=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only about 300,000 vehicles were registered in 1918 in all of Canada, but by 1929, there were 1.9 million, and automobile parts were being manufactured in [[Ontario]], near [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The automotive industry's influence on other segments of the economy were widespread, jump starting industries such as steel production, highway building, [[motel]]s, service stations, car dealerships, and new housing outside the urban core.

Ford opened factories around the world and proved a strong competitor in most markets for its low-cost, easy-maintenance vehicles.  [[General Motors]], to a lesser degree, followed. European competitors avoided the low-price market and concentrated on more expensive vehicles for upscale consumers.&lt;ref&gt;James Foreman-Peck, "The American challenge of the twenties: multinationals and the European motor industry." ''Journal of Economic History'' 42#4 (1982): 865–881&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Radio ====
Radio became the first [[Mass media|mass broadcasting medium]]. Radios were expensive, but their mode of entertainment proved revolutionary. Radio advertising became a platform for [[mass marketing]]. Its economic importance led to the [[Media culture|mass culture]] that has dominated society since this period. During the "[[Golden Age of Radio]]", [[radio programming]] was as varied as the [[Television program]]ming of the 21st century. The 1927 establishment of the [[Federal Radio Commission]] introduced a new era of regulation.

In 1925, [[Gramophone record#Electrical recording|electrical recording]], one of the greatest advances in [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]], became available with commercially-issued gramophone records.

==== Cinema ====
The [[Film industry|cinema]] boomed, producing a new form of entertainment that virtually ended the old [[vaudeville]] theatrical genre. Watching a film was cheap and accessible; crowds surged into new downtown [[movie palace]]s and neighborhood theaters. Since the early 1910s, lower-priced cinema successfully competed with vaudeville. Many vaudeville performers and other theatrical personalities were recruited by the film industry, lured by greater salaries and less arduous working conditions. The introduction of the [[sound film]] at the end of the decade of the 1920s eliminated vaudeville's last major advantage. Vaudeville was in sharp financial decline. The prestigious [[Orpheum Circuit]], a chain of vaudeville and movie theaters, was absorbed by a new film studio.&lt;ref name="Kendricklove"&gt;Kenrick, John.

===== Sound movies =====
In 1923, inventor [[Lee de Forest]] at [[Phonofilm]] released a number of short films with sound. Meanwhile, inventor [[Theodore Case]] developed the [[Movietone sound system]] and sold the rights to the film studio, [[Fox Film]]. In 1926, the [[Vitaphone]] sound system was introduced. The feature film ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]'' (1926) was the first feature-length film to use the Vitaphone sound system with a synchronized musical score and sound effects, though it had no spoken dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Warner Bros. Studios|last2=Wanamaker|first2=Marc|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2010|isbn=0-738-58091-0|page=25|last1=Stephens|first1=E. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released by the film studio [[Warner Bros.]] In October 1927, the sound film ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927) turned out to be a smash box office success. It was innovative for its use of sound. Produced with the Vitaphone system, most of the film does not contain live-recorded audio, relying on a score and effects. When the movie's star, [[Al Jolson]], sings, however, the film shifts to sound recorded on the set, including both his musical performances and two scenes with ad-libbed speech—one of Jolson's character, Jakie Rabinowitz (Jack Robin), addressing a cabaret audience; the other an exchange between he and his mother. The "natural" sounds of the settings were also audible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amps.net/newsletters/issue23/23_jazz.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991022042212/http://www.amps.net/newsletters/Issue23/23_jazz.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1999-10-22 |title=Why ''The Jazz Singer''? |date=Autumn 1997 |publisher=Association of Motion Picture Sound |author=Allen, Bob |work=AMPS Newsletter |accessdate=December 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's profits were proof enough to the film industry that the technology was worth investing in.&lt;ref&gt;Geduld (1975), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, the film studios [[Famous Players-Lasky]] (later known as [[Paramount Pictures]]), [[First National Pictures]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and [[Universal Studios]] signed an agreement with Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI) for the conversion of production facilities and theaters for sound film. Initially, all ERPI-wired theaters were made Vitaphone-compatible; most were equipped to project Movietone reels as well.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1928, [[RCA|Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) marketed a new sound system, the [[RCA Photophone]] system. RCA offered the rights to its system to the subsidiary [[RKO Pictures]]. Warner Bros. continued releasing a few films with live dialogue, though only in a few scenes. It finally released ''[[Lights of New York (1928 film)|Lights of New York]]'' (1928), the first all-talking full-length feature film. The animated short film ''[[Dinner Time (film)|Dinner Time]]'' (1928) by the [[Van Beuren Studios]] was among the first animated sound films. It was followed a few months later by the animated short film ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' (1928), the first sound film by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]. It was the first commercially successful animated short film and introduced the character [[Mickey Mouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;''Steamboat Willie'' was the first cartoon to feature a fully post-produced soundtrack, which distinguished it from earlier sound cartoons. It became the most popular cartoon of its day.&lt;ref name="SS"&gt;[http://www.screensavour.net/2008/08/steamboat-willie-1928.html ''Steamboat Willie'' (1929)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121043940/http://www.screensavour.net/2008/08/steamboat-willie-1928.html |date=2011-11-21 }} at Screen Savour&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of 1928, Warner Bros. was the only studio to release [[List of early Warner Bros. talking features|talking features]]. It profited from its innovative films at the box office. Other studios quickened the pace of their conversion to the new technology and started producing their own sound films and talking films. In February 1929, sixteen months after ''The Jazz Singer'', [[Columbia Pictures]]  became the eighth and last major studio to release a talking feature. In May 1929, Warner Bros. released ''[[On with the Show (1929 film)|On with the Show!]]'' (1929), the first all-color, all-talking feature film.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson (2001), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon [[silent film]] production ceased. The last totally silent feature produced in the US for general distribution was ''The Poor Millionaire'', released by Biltmore Pictures in April 1930. Four other silent features, all low-budget [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], were also released in early-1930.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson (2001), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aviation ====
[[File:Amy_Johnson_portrait.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amy_Johnson_portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|British flier Amy Johnson, 1930]]

The 1920s saw milestones in aviation that seized the world's attention. In 1927, [[Charles Lindbergh]] rose to fame with the first solo nonstop [[transatlantic flight]]. He took off from [[Roosevelt Field (airport)|Roosevelt Field]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] and landed at [[Paris–Le Bourget Airport]]. It took Lindbergh  33.5 hours to cross the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2012, pp. 512–516.&lt;/ref&gt; His aircraft, the [[Spirit of St. Louis]], was a custom-built, single engine, single-seat [[monoplane]]. It was designed by [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]] [[Donald A. Hall]]. In Britain [[Amy Johnson]] (1903–1941) was the first woman to fly alone from Britain to Australia. Flying solo or with her husband, Jim Mollison, she set numerous long-distance records during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Dunmore, ''Undaunted: Long-Distance Flyers in the Golden Age of Aviation'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Television ====
The 1920s saw several inventors advance work on [[History of television|television]], but programs did not reach the public until the eve of the Second World War, and few people saw any television before the late-1940s.

In July 1928, [[John Logie Baird]] demonstrated the world's first color transmission, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with a filter of a different primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a commutator to alternate their illumination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=JRVAAAAAEBAJ|title=Patent US1925554 – Television apparatus and the like}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year he also demonstrated stereoscopic television.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Tiltman, [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/stereo.html How "Stereoscopic" Television is Shown], ''Radio News'', November 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Baird transmitted a long-distance television signal over {{convert|438|mi|km}} of telephone line between London and [[Glasgow]]; Baird transmitted the world's first long-distance television pictures to the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central Station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/video.html?vxSiteId=60fdd544-9c52-4e17-be7e-57a2a2d76992&amp;vxChannel=History%20Places&amp;vxClipId=1380_SMG1671&amp;vxBitrate=300 Interview with Paul Lyons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202163233/http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/video.html?vxSiteId=60fdd544-9c52-4e17-be7e-57a2a2d76992&amp;vxChannel=History%20Places&amp;vxClipId=1380_SMG1671&amp;vxBitrate=300 |date=2009-02-02 }}, Historian and Control and Information Officer at Glasgow Central Station&lt;/ref&gt; Baird then set up the [[Edward Manville|Baird Television Development Company Ltd]], which in 1928 made the first transatlantic television transmission, from London to [[Hartsdale]], New York, and the first television programme for the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name="Historical Figures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Figures: John Logie Baird (1888–1946)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/baird_logie.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medicine====
{{Further|History of penicillin}}

For decades biologists had been at work on the medicine that became penicillin. In 1928, Scottish biologist [[Alexander Fleming]] discovered a substance that killed a number of disease-causing [[bacteria]]. In 1929, he named the new substance "[[penicillin]]".  His publications were largely ignored at first, but it became a significant [[antibiotics|antibiotic]] in the 1930s. In 1930, Cecil George Paine, a [[pathologist]] at [[Sheffield Royal Infirmary]], used penicillin to treat [[sycosis barbae]], eruptions in beard follicles, but was unsuccessful.  Moving on to [[Neonatal conjunctivitis|ophthalmia neonatorum]], a gonococcal infection in infants, he achieved the first recorded cure with penicillin, on November 25, 1930. He then cured four additional patients (one adult and three infants) of eye infections, but failed to cure a fifth.&lt;ref name="Wainwright, M &amp; Swan, HT 1986 42–56"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Wainwright M, Swan HT

===New infrastructure===
The automobile's dominance led to a new psychology celebrating mobility.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Flink, "Three stages of American automobile consciousness." ''American Quarterly'' 24.4 (1972): 451-473. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2711684 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Cars and trucks needed road construction, new bridges, and regular highway maintenance, largely funded by local and state government through taxes on gasoline.  Farmers were early adopters as they used their pickups to haul people, supplies and animals.  New industries were spun off—to make tires and glass and refine fuel, and to service and repair cars and trucks by the millions. New car dealers were franchised by the car makers and became prime movers in the local business community.  Tourism gained an enormous boost, with hotels, restaurants and curio shops proliferating.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Jakle, and Keith A. Sculle, ''Fast food: Roadside restaurants in the automobile age'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher W. Wells, ''Car Country: Automobiles, Roads and the Shaping of the Modern American Landscape, 1890–1929'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electrification]], having slowed during the war, progressed greatly as more of the US and Canada was added to the [[electrical grid]]. Industries switched from [[coal]] power to [[electricity]]. At the same time, new [[power plant]]s were constructed. In America, electricity production almost quadrupled.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Nye, ''Electrifying America: Social meanings of a new technology, 1880–1940'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Telephone]] lines also were being strung across the continent. Indoor [[plumbing]] and modern [[sanitary sewer|sewer system]]s were installed for the first time in many houses.

[[Urbanization]] reached a milestone in the 1920 census, that showed slightly more Americans lived in urban areas towns and cities of 2,500 or more people than in small towns or rural areas. However, the nation was fascinated with its great metropolitan centers that contained about 15 percent of the population. New York and Chicago vied in building skyscrapers, and New York pulled ahead with the [[Empire State Building]].  The basic pattern of the modern [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] job was set during the late-19th century, but it now became the norm for life in large and medium cities. Typewriters, filing cabinets, and telephones brought unmarried women into clerical jobs. In Canada, by the end of the decade one in five workers was a woman. Interest in finding jobs in the now ever-growing manufacturing sector in US cities became widespread among rural Americans.&lt;ref name=farmdep&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhistoryusa.com/great-farm-depression-1920s/|title=The Great (Farm) Depression of the 1920s|author=Dan Bryan|publisher=American History USA|accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==

===Suffrage===
{{Main article|Women's suffrage}}
With some exceptions,&lt;ref&gt;The vote came years later in France, Italy, Quebec, Spain and Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; many countries expanded women's voting rights in representative and direct democracies across the world such as the United States, Canada, Great Britain and most major European countries in 1917–1921, as well as India. This influenced many governments and elections by increasing the number of voters. Politicians responded by focusing more on issues of concern to women, especially peace, public health, education, and the status of children. On the whole, women voted much like men, except they were more interested in peace.&lt;ref&gt;June Hannam, Mitzi Auchterlonie, and Katherine Holden, eds.

===Lost Generation===
{{Main article|Lost Generation}}
The Lost Generation was composed of young people who came out of World War I disillusioned and cynical about the world. The term usually refers to American literary notables who lived in Paris at the time. Famous members included [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], and [[Gertrude Stein]]. These authors, some of them [[expatriates]], wrote novels and short stories expressing their resentment towards the materialism and individualism rampant during this era.

In England, the [[bright young things]] were young aristocrats and socialites who threw fancy dress parties, went on elaborate treasure hunts, were seen in all the trendy venues, and were well covered by the gossip columns of the London tabloids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D. J. Taylor|title=Bright Young People: The Lost Generation of London's Jazz Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W_P5kIqTiRIC&amp;pg=PT303|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|page=303|isbn=978-1-4299-5895-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social criticism===
{{Main article|Social issues of the 1920s in the United States}}

[[File:Chrysler Building at night.JPG|thumb|upright|Climax of the new architectural style: the Chrysler Building in New York City was built after the European wave of [[Art Deco]] reached the United States.]]

As the average American in the 1920s became more enamored of wealth and everyday luxuries, some began satirizing the hypocrisy and greed they observed. Of these social critics, [[Sinclair Lewis]] was the most popular. His popular 1920 novel ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' satirized the dull and ignorant lives of the residents of a Midwestern town. He followed with ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'', about a [[Middle age|middle-aged]] businessman who rebels against his dull life and family, only to realize that the younger generation is as hypocritical as his own. Lewis satirized religion with ''[[Elmer Gantry]]'', which followed a [[Confidence trick|con man]] who teams up with an evangelist to sell religion to a small town.

Other social critics included [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Edith Wharton]], and [[H.L. Mencken]]. Anderson published a collection of short stories titled ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', which studied the dynamics of a small town. Wharton mocked the fads of the new era through her novels, such as ''Twilight Sleep'' (1927). Mencken criticized narrow American tastes and culture in essays and articles.

===Art Deco===
{{Main article|Art Deco}}
Art Deco was the style of design and architecture that marked the era. Originating in Europe, it spread to the rest of western Europe and North America towards the mid-1920s.

In the US, one of the most remarkable buildings featuring this style was constructed as the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world|tallest building]] of the time: the [[Chrysler Building]]. The forms of art deco were pure and geometric, though the artists often drew inspiration from nature. In the beginning, lines were curved, though rectilinear designs would later become more and more popular.

===Expressionism and surrealism===
{{further information|Weimar culture}}
[[Painting]] in North America during the 1920s developed in a different direction from that of Europe. In Europe, the 1920s were the era of [[expressionism]], and later [[surrealism]]. As [[Man Ray]] stated in 1920 after the publication of a unique issue of ''New York Dada'': "[[Dada]] cannot live in New York".

[[File:felix-pace.jpg|thumb|left|[[Felix the Cat]], a popular cartoon character of the decade, exhibits his famous pace.]]
At the beginning of the decade, films were silent and colorless. In 1922, the first all-color feature, ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'', was released. In 1926, [[Warner Bros.]] released ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]'', the first feature with [[sound effect]]s and music. In 1927, Warner released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', the first sound feature to include limited talking sequences.

The public went wild for [[talkies]], and movie studios converted to sound almost overnight.&lt;ref&gt;Geduld, Harry M. (1975). ''The Birth of the Talkies: From Edison to Jolson''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. {{ISBN|0-253-10743-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Warner released ''[[Lights of New York (1928 film)|Lights of New York]]'', the first all-talking feature film. In the same year, the first sound cartoon, ''[[Dinner Time (cartoon)|Dinner Time]]'', was released. Warner ended the decade by unveiling, in 1929, the first all-color, all-talking feature film, ''[[On with the Show (1929 film)|On with the Show]]''.

Cartoon shorts were popular in movie theaters during this time. In the late 1920s, [[Walt Disney]] emerged. [[Mickey Mouse]] made his debut in ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' on November 18, 1928, at the Colony Theater in New York City. Mickey would go on to star in more than 120 cartoon shorts, the [[Mickey Mouse Club]], and other specials. This would jump-start Disney and lead to creation of other characters going into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;emmickey_UNCG http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characterstandard/mickey/mickey.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|Oswald]], a character created by Disney, before Mickey, in 1927, was contracted by [[Universal Studios|Universal]] for distribution purposes, and starred in a series of shorts between 1927 and 1928. Disney lost the rights to the character, but in 2006, regained the rights to Oswald. He was the first Disney character to be merchandised.&lt;ref&gt;emmickey_UNCG http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/oswald/oswald.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The period had the emergence of [[Box office|box-office]] draws such as [[Mae Murray]], [[Ramón Novarro]], [[Rudolph Valentino]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Warner Baxter]], [[Clara Bow]], [[Louise Brooks]], [[Bebe Daniels]], [[Billie Dove]], [[Dorothy Mackaill]], [[Mary Astor]], [[Nancy Carroll]], [[Janet Gaynor]], [[Charles Farrell]], [[William Haines]], [[Conrad Nagel]], [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Dolores del Río]], [[Norma Talmadge]], [[Colleen Moore]], [[Nita Naldi]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Norma Shearer]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Anna May Wong]], and [[Al Jolson]].&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Ellrod, ''The Stars of Hollywood Remembered: Career Biographies of 81 Actors and Actesses of the Golden Era, 1920s–1950s'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harlem===
{{Main article|Harlem Renaissance}}
African-American literary and artistic culture developed rapidly during the 1920s under the banner of the "[[Harlem Renaissance]]". In 1921, the [[Black Swan Records|Black Swan Corporation]] was founded. At its height, it issued 10 recordings per month. All-African American musicals also started in 1921. In 1923, the [[New York Renaissance|Harlem Renaissance Basketball Club]] was founded by [[Bob Douglas]]. During the late-1920s, and especially in the 1930s, the [[Basketball|basketball team]] became known as the best in the world.

The first issue of ''[[Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life|Opportunity]]'' was published. The African American playwright, Willis Richardson, debuted his play ''The Chip Woman's Fortune'', at the Frazee Theatre (also known as the [[Wallacks theatre]]).{{ref|fn_1}} Notable African American authors such as [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Zora Neale Hurston]] began to achieve a level of national public recognition during the 1920s.

===Jazz Age===
{{Further|Jazz Age|Jazz}}
The 1920s brought new styles of music into the mainstream of culture in avant-garde cities. [[Jazz]] became the most popular form of music for youth.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Shaw, ''The Jazz Age: Popular Music in the 1920s'' (Oxford UP, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Kathy J. Ogren says that by the 1920s jazz had become the "dominant influence on America's popular music generally."&lt;ref&gt;Kathy J. Ogren, ''The Jazz Revolution: Twenties America and the Meaning of Jazz'' (1989) p 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott DeVeaux argues that a standard history of jazz has emerged such that: "After an obligatory nod to African origins and ragtime antecedents, the music is shown to move through a succession of styles or periods: New Orleans jazz up through the 1920s, swing in the 1930s, bebop in the 1940s, cool jazz and hard bop in the 1950s, free jazz and fusion in the 1960s.... There is substantial agreement on the defining features of each style, the pantheon of great innovators, and the canon of recorded masterpieces."&lt;ref&gt;Scott DeVeaux,  "Constructing the Jazz Tradition: Jazz Historiography." ''Black American Literature Forum'' 25#3 (1991) pp 525–60 [http://wayneandwax.com/pdfs/deveaux-constructing-jazz-trad.pdf in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;

The pantheon of performers and singers from the 1920s include [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Sidney Bechet]], [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Joe "King" Oliver]], [[James P. Johnson]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Frankie Trumbauer]], [[Paul Whiteman]], [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Adelaide Hall]] and [[Bing Crosby]]. The development of urban and city blues also began in the 1920s with performers such as [[Bessie Smith]] and [[Ma Rainey]]. In the latter part of the decade, early forms of [[country music]] were pioneered by [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[The Carter Family]], [[Uncle Dave Macon]], [[Vernon Dalhart]], and [[Charlie Poole]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Gioia, ''The History of Jazz'' (Oxford UP, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dance===
Dance clubs became enormously popular in the 1920s. Their popularity peaked in the late 1920s and reached into the early 1930s. Dance music came to dominate all forms of popular music by the late 1920s. Classical pieces, operettas, folk music, etc., were all transformed into popular dancing melodies to satiate the public craze for dancing much as the [[disco]] phenomenon later did in the late 1970s. For example, many of the songs from the 1929 [[Technicolor]] musical operetta "[[The Rogue Song]]" (starring the Metropolitan Opera star [[Lawrence Tibbett]]) were rearranged and released as dancing music and became popular dance club hits in 1929.

Dance clubs across the US-sponsored dancing contests, where dancers invented, tried and competed with new moves. Professionals began to hone their skills in tap dance and other dances of the era throughout the stage circuit across the United States. With the advent of talking pictures (sound film), musicals became all the rage and film studios flooded the box office with extravagant and lavish musical films. The representative was the musicals ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'', which became the highest-grossing film of the decade. Harlem played a key role in the development of dance styles. Several entertainment venues attracted people of all races.  The [[Cotton Club]] featured black performers and catered to a white clientele, while the [[Savoy Ballroom]] catered to a mostly black clientele.  Some religious moralists preached against "Satan in the dance hall" but had little impact.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph G. Giordano, ''Satan in the dance hall: Rev. John Roach Straton, social dancing, and morality in 1920s New York City'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular dances throughout the decade were the [[foxtrot]], [[waltz]], and [[American tango]]. From the early 1920s, however, a variety of eccentric novelty dances were developed. The first of these were the [[Breakaway (dance)|Breakaway]] and [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]]. Both were based on African American musical styles and beats, including the widely popular [[blues]]. The Charleston's popularity exploded after its feature in two 1922 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows. A brief [[Black Bottom (dance)|Black Bottom]] craze, originating from the [[Apollo Theater]], swept dance halls from 1926 to 1927, replacing the Charleston in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Danielle Robinson, "'Oh, You Black Bottom!' Appropriation, Authenticity, and Opportunity in the Jazz Dance Teaching of 1920s New York." ''Dance Research Journal'' 38.1–2 (2006): 19–42.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1927, the [[Lindy Hop]], a dance based on Breakaway and Charleston and integrating elements of tap, became the dominant [[social dance]]. Developed in the Savoy Ballroom, it was set to [[stride piano]] [[ragtime]] jazz. The Lindy Hop later evolved into other [[Swing (dance)|Swing]] dances.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Spring,  "Swing and the Lindy Hop: dance, venue, media, and tradition." ''American Music'' (1997) 15#2: 183–207 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3052731 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;  These dances, nonetheless, never became mainstream, and the overwhelming majority of people in Western Europe and the U.S. continued to dance the foxtrot, waltz, and tango throughout the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frances Rust|title=Dance in Society: An Analysis of the Relationship Between the Social Dance and Society in England from the Middle Ages to the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OblYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189|year=1969|publisher=Routledge|page=189|isbn=978-1-134-55407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dance craze had a large influence on popular music. Large numbers of recordings labeled as foxtrot, tango, and waltz were produced and gave rise to a generation of performers who became famous as recording artists or radio artists. Top vocalists included [[Nick Lucas]], [[Adelaide Hall]], [[Scrappy Lambert]], Frank Munn, [[Lewis James]], [[Chester Gaylord]], [[Gene Austin]], [[James Melton]], [[Franklyn Baur]], Johnny Marvin, [[Annette Hanshaw]], [[Helen Kane]], [[Vaughn De Leath]], and [[Ruth Etting]]. Leading dance orchestra leaders included [[Bob Haring]], [[Harry Horlick]], Louis Katzman, [[Leo Reisman]], [[Victor Arden]], [[Phil Ohman]], [[George Olsen]], [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]], [[Abe Lyman]], [[Ben Selvin]], [[Nat Shilkret]], [[Fred Waring]], and [[Paul Whiteman]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Cox, ''Music radio: the great performers and programs of the 1920s through early 1960s'' (McFarland, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

''American Historical Review'' 98.3 (1993): 657-684.&lt;/ref&gt;  The fashion for women was all about getting loose. Women wore dresses all day, everyday. Day dresses had a drop waist, which was a sash or belt around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee, never above. Daywear had sleeves (long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleaded, hank hem, or tired.  Jewelry was less conspicuous.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Bliss, "'L’intelligence de la parure': Notes on Jewelry Wearing in the 1920s."

''Fashion Theory'' 1.4 (1997): 367-397.&lt;/ref&gt;

For men in white collar jobs, business suits were the day to day attire. Striped, plaid, or windowpane suits came in dark gray, blue, and brown in the winter and ivory, white, tan, and pastels in the summer. Shirts  were white and neckties were essential.&lt;ref&gt;Angel Kwolek-Folland, ''Engendering Business: Men and Women in the Corporate Office, 1870-1930'' (Johns Hopkins UP, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

Immortalized in movies and magazine covers, young women's fashions of the 1920s set both a trend and social statement, a breaking-off from the rigid [[Victorian era|Victorian]] way of life. These young, rebellious, middle-class women, labeled 'flappers' by older generations, did away with the corset and donned slinky knee-length dresses, which exposed their legs and arms. The hairstyle of the decade was a chin-length bob, which had several popular variations. [[Cosmetics]], which until the 1920s were not typically accepted in American society because of their association with [[prostitution]], became, for the first time, extremely popular.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Kitch, ''The Girl on the Magazine Cover'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2001). pp. 122–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s new magazines appealed to young German women with a sensuous image and advertisements for the appropriate clothes and accessories they would want to purchase.  The glossy pages of ''Die Dame'' and ''Das Blatt der Hausfrau'' displayed the "Neue Frauen," "New Girl" – what Americans called the [[flapper]].  She was young and fashionable, financially independent, and was an eager consumer of the latest fashions. The magazines kept her up to date on styles, clothes, designers, arts, sports, and modern technology such as automobiles and telephones.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Sylvester, "Before Cosmopolitan: The Girl in German women's magazines in the 1920s." ''Journalism Studies'' 8#4 (2007): 550–554.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality of women during the 1920s===
The 1920s was a period of social revolution, coming out of World War I, society changed as inhibitions faded and youth demanded new experiences and more freedom from old controls. Chaperones faded in importance as "anything goes" became a slogan for youth taking control of their subculture.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Moore, ''Anything Goes: A Biography of the Roaring Twenties'' (Atlantic Books, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  A new woman was born—a "flapper" who danced, drank, smoked and voted. This new woman cut her hair, wore make-up, and partied. She was known for being giddy and taking risks; she was known as a flapper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Popular Culture: 1920–1938|last=Bingham|first=Jane|publisher=Heinemann Library|year=2012|isbn=|location=Chicago Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women gained the right to vote in most countries. New careers opened for single women in offices and schools, with salaries that helped them to be more independent.&lt;ref&gt;Paula S. Fass, ''The Damned and the Beautiful: American Youth in the 1920s'' (Oxford UP, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;  With their desire for freedom and independence came change in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Litchfield Historical Society|title=The House of Worth: Fashion Sketches, 1916–1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhUvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|year=2015|publisher=Courier Dover|isbn=978-0-486-79924-7|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most dramatic post-war changes in fashion was the woman's silhouette; the dress length went from floor length to ankle and knee length, becoming more bold and seductive.  The new dress code emphasized youth: corsets were left behind and clothing was looser, with more natural lines. The [[hourglass figure]] was not popular anymore, whereas a slimmer, boyish body type was considered appealing. The [[flapper]]s were known for this and for their high spirits, flirtatiousness, and stereotypical recklessness when it came to their search for fun and thrills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Language of Clothes|last=Lurie|first=Alison|publisher=New York: Random House|year=1981|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coco Chanel]] was one of the most enigmatic fashion figures of the 1920s. She was recognized for her avant-garde designs; her clothing was a mixture of wearable, comfortable, and elegant. She was the one to introduce a different aesthetic into fashion, especially a different sense for what was feminine, and based her design on new ethics; she designed for an active woman, one that could feel at ease in her dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fashion &amp; Accessories|last=Brand|first=Jan|publisher=Arnhem :Terra|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanel's primary goal was to empower freedom. She was the pioneer for women wearing pants and for the [[little black dress]], which were signs of a more independent lifestyle.

===The changing role of women===

[[File:Map_of_US_Suffrage,_1920.svg | thumb|left | Map of local U.S. suffrage laws just prior to passing of the 19th Amendment&lt;br&gt;Dark blue = full women's suffrage&lt;br&gt;Bright red = no women's suffrage]]

Most British historians depict the 1920s as an era of domesticity for women with little feminist progress, apart from full suffrage which came in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1191/1478003804cs0014ra|title='An Era of Domesticity'? Histories of Women and Gender in Interwar Britain|journal=Cultural and Social History|volume=1|issue=2|pages=225–233|year=2015|last1=Bingham|first1=Adrian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the contrary, argues Alison Light, literary sources reveal that many British women enjoyed:
: the buoyant sense of excitement and release which animates so many of the more broadly cultural activities which different groups of women enjoyed in this period. What new kinds of social and personal opportunity, for example, were offered by the changing cultures of sport and entertainment. . . by new patterns of domestic life . . . new forms of a household appliance, new attitudes to housework?&lt;ref&gt;Alison Light, ''Forever England: Femininity, Literature and Conservatism between the Wars'' (1991) p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] in 1920, that [[Women's suffrage|gave women the right to vote]], American feminists attained the [[political equality]] they had been waiting for. A generational gap began to form between the "new" women of the 1920s and the previous generation. Prior to the 19th Amendment, [[feminism|feminists]] commonly thought women could not pursue both a career and a family successfully, believing one would inherently inhibit the development of the other. This mentality began to change in the 1920s, as more women began to desire not only successful careers of their own, but also families.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Dorothy M. ''Setting a Course: American Women in the 1920s'' (Twayne Publishers, 1987) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The "new" woman was less invested in social service than the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive]] generations, and in tune with the consumerist spirit of the era, she was eager to compete and to find personal fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Woloch, ''Women and the American Experience: A Concise History'' (2002). p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Higher education was rapidly expanding for women.  Linda Eisenmann claims, "New collegiate opportunities for women profoundly redefined womanhood by challenging the Victorian belief that men's and women's social roles were rooted in biology."&lt;ref&gt;Linda Eisenmann, ''Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States'' (1998) p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising agencies exploited the new status of women, for example in publishing automobile ads in women's magazines, at a time when the vast majority of purchasers and drivers were men.  The new ads promoted new freedoms for affluent women while also suggesting the outer limits of the new freedoms. Automobiles were more than practical devices. They were also highly visible symbols of affluence, mobility, and modernity.  The ads, says  Einav Rabinovitch-Fox, "offered women a visual vocabulary to imagine their new social and political roles as citizens and to play an active role in shaping their identity as modern women."&lt;ref&gt;"Baby, You Can Drive My Car: Advertising Women's Freedom in 1920s America." ''American Journalism'' 33.4 (2016): 372–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant changes in the lives of [[women in the workforce|working women]] occurred in the 1920s. [[World War I]] had temporarily allowed women to enter into industries such as chemical, automobile, and iron and steel manufacturing, which were once deemed inappropriate work for women.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Kessler-Harris, ''Out to Work: A History of Wage-Earning Women in the United States'' (Oxford University Press, 2003) p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Black women, who had been historically closed out of factory jobs, began to find a place in industry during World War I by accepting lower wages and replacing the lost immigrant labor and in heavy work. Yet, like other women during World War I, their success was only temporary; most black women were also pushed out of their factory jobs after the war. In 1920, 75% of the black female labor force consisted of agricultural laborers, domestic servants, and laundry workers.&lt;ref name="Kessler-Harris, Alice 2003. p. 237"&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''Out to Work: A History of Wage-Earning Women in the United States'' p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Equal_Rights_Envoys_159003v.jpg | thumb|right | Equal Rights envoys of the National Woman's Party, 1927]]

Legislation passed at the beginning of the 20th century mandated a [[minimum wage]] and forced many factories to shorten their workdays. This shifted the focus in the 1920s to job performance to meet demand. Factories encouraged workers to produce more quickly and efficiently with speedups and bonus systems, increasing the pressure on factory workers. Despite the strain on women in the factories, the booming economy of the 1920s meant more opportunities even for the lower classes. Many young girls from [[working class]] backgrounds did not need to help support their families as prior generations did and were often encouraged to seek work or receive vocational training which would result in social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, '' Out to Work: A History of Wage-Earning Women in the United States'' pp 237, 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of [[suffrage]] led to feminists refocusing their efforts towards other goals. Groups such as the [[National Women's Party]] continued the political fight, proposing the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in 1923 and working to remove laws that used sex to discriminate against women,&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Woloch,  ''Women and the American Experience: A Concise History'' (McGraw–Hill, 2002) p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; but many women shifted their focus from politics to challenge traditional definitions of womanhood.

Young women, especially, began staking claim to their own bodies and took part in a [[sexual revolution|sexual liberation]] of their generation. Many of the ideas that fueled this change in sexual thought were already floating around New York intellectual circles prior to World War I, with the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Havelock Ellis]] and [[Ellen Key]]. There, thinkers claimed that sex was not only central to the human experience, but also that women were sexual beings with human impulses and desires, and restraining these impulses was self-destructive. By the 1920s, these ideas had permeated the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Woloch, ''Women and the American Experience: A Concise History'' p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, the [[co-ed]] emerged, as women began attending large state colleges and universities. Women entered into the mainstream [[middle class]] experience but took on a gendered role within society. Women typically took classes such as home economics, "Husband and Wife", "Motherhood" and "The Family as an Economic Unit". In an increasingly conservative postwar era, a young woman commonly would attend college with the intention of finding a suitable husband. Fueled by ideas of sexual liberation, [[dating]] underwent major changes on college campuses. With the advent of the [[automobile]], courtship occurred in a much more private setting. "[[making out|Petting]]", sexual relations without intercourse, became the social norm for a portion of college students.&lt;ref&gt;Woloch, ''Women and the American Experience: A Concise History'', pp. 28–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite women's increased knowledge of pleasure and [[sexual intercourse|sex]], the decade of unfettered capitalism that was the 1920s gave birth to the '[[The Feminine Mystique|feminine mystique]]'. With this formulation, all women wanted to marry, all good women stayed at home with their children, cooking and cleaning, and the best women did the aforementioned and in addition, exercised their purchasing power freely and as frequently as possible to better their families and their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Schwartz Cowan, ''Two Washes in the Morning and a Bridge Party at Night: The American Housewife between the Wars'' (1976)  p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberalism in Europe===
The Allied victory in the First World War seems to mark the triumph of [[History of Liberalism|liberalism]], not just in the Allied countries themselves, but also in Germany and in the new states of Eastern Europe, as well as Japan. Authoritarian militarism as typified by Germany had been defeated and discredited. Historian Martin Blinkhorn argues that the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of "cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free-market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the League of Nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Atkin|author2=Michael Biddiss|title=Themes in Modern European History, 1890–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DFN_AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA244|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|pages=243–44|isbn=978-1-134-22257-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as early as 1917, the emerging liberal order was being challenged by the new [[Communist International|communist movement]] taking inspiration from the Russian Revolution. Communist revolts were beaten back everywhere else, but they did succeed in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M. Luebbert, ''Liberalism, fascism, or social democracy: Social classes and the political origins of regimes in interwar Europe'' (Oxford UP, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

The many gay rights groups in Weimar Germany favored a militarised rhetoric with a vision of a spiritually and politically emancipated hypermasculine gay man who fought to legitimize "friendship" and secure civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Crouthamel, "'Comradeship' and 'Friendship': Masculinity and Militarisation in Germany's Homosexual Emancipation Movement after the First World War," ''Gender and History'', (April 2011) 23#1 pp 111–129&lt;/ref&gt;  Ramsey explores several variations.  On the left, the ''Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee'' ([[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]]; WhK) reasserted the traditional view that homosexuals were an effeminate "third sex" whose sexual ambiguity and nonconformity was biologically determined. The radical nationalist ''Gemeinschaft der Eigenen'' (Community of the Self-Owned) proudly proclaimed homosexuality as heir to the manly German and classical Greek traditions of homoerotic male bonding, which enhanced the arts and glorified relationships with young men. The politically centrist ''Bund für Menschenrecht'' (League for Human Rights) engaged in a struggle for human rights, advising gays to live in accordance with the mores of middle-class German respectability.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Ramsey,  "The Rites of 'Artgenossen': Contesting Homosexual Political Culture in Weimar Germany," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'', (January 2008), 17#1 pp 85–109&lt;/ref&gt;

Humor was used to assist in acceptability. One popular American song, "Masculine Women, Feminine Men",&lt;ref&gt;The song was written by Edgar Leslie (words) and James V. Monaco (music) and featured in Hugh J. Ward's Musical Comedy "Lady Be Good."&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 1926 and recorded by numerous artists of the day; it included these lyrics:&lt;ref&gt;Artists who recorded this song include: 1. Frank Harris (Irving Kaufman), (Columbia 569D,1/29/26) 2. Bill Meyerl &amp; Gwen Farrar (the UK, 1926) 3. Joy Boys (the UK, 1926) 4. Harry Reser's Six Jumping Jacks (the UK, 2/13/26) 5.

The relative liberalism of the decade is demonstrated by the fact that the actor [[William Haines]], regularly named in newspapers and magazines as the #1 male box-office draw, openly lived in a gay relationship with his partner, [[Jimmie Shields]]. Other popular gay actors/actresses of the decade included [[Alla Nazimova]] and [[Ramón Novarro]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann, William J., '' Wisecracker: the life and times of William Haines, Hollywood's first openly gay star'' (Viking, 1998) pp 2–6, 12–13, 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1927, [[Mae West]] wrote a play about homosexuality called ''The Drag'',&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.amazon.com/Three-Plays-Mae-West-Pleasure/dp/0415909325 ''Three Plays by Mae West: Sex, The Drag and Pleasure Man'' ]&lt;/ref&gt; and alluded to the work of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]]. It was a box-office success. West regarded talking about sex as a basic [[human rights]] issue, and was also an early advocate of [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jill Watts|title=Mae West: An Icon in Black and White|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpMzyL6w2v4C&amp;pg=PA300|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=300|isbn=978-0-19-534767-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalysis===
Vienna psychiatrist [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939) played a major role in [[Psychoanalysis]], which impacted avant-garde thinking, especially in the humanities and artistic fields.  Historian [[Roy Porter]] says:
:He advanced challenging theoretical concepts such as unconscious mental states and their repression, infantile sexuality and the symbolic meaning of dreams and hysterical symptoms, and he prized the investigative techniques of free association and dream interpretation, to methods for overcoming resistance and uncovering hidden unconscious wishes.&lt;ref name=Porter&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy Porter|title=The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcpFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA516|year=1999|publisher=W. W. Norton|pages=516–517|isbn=978-0-393-24244-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influential proponents of psychoanalysis included [[Alfred Adler]] (1870–1937), [[Karen Horney]] (1885–1952), and [[Helene Deutsch]] (1884–1982). Adler argued that a neurotic individual would overcompensate by manifesting aggression. Porter notes that Adler's views became part of "an American commitment to social stability  based on individual adjustment and adaptation to healthy, social forms."&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt;

The United States became more [[anti-immigration]] in policy. The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] limited immigration to a fraction proportionate to that ethnic group in the United States in 1890.  The goal was to freeze the pattern of European ethnic composition, and to exclude almost all Asians. Hispanics were not restricted.&lt;ref&gt;John Higham, ''Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860–1925'' (1955) pp 312–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia, New Zealand and Canada also sharply restricted or ended Asian immigration.
In Canada, the [[Chinese Immigration Act, 1923|Chinese Immigration Act of 1923]] prevented almost all immigration from Asia. Other laws curbed immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Bashford,  "Immigration restriction: rethinking period and place from settler colonies to postcolonial nations." ''Journal of Global History'' 9#1 (2014): 26–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Peter Ward, ''White Canada forever: popular attitudes and public policy towards Orientals in British Columbia'' (McGill-Queens UP, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. O'Connor, "Keeping New Zealand white, 1908–1920", ''New Zealand Journal of History'' 2 (1968) pp. 41–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sean Brawley, ''The white peril: foreign relations and Asian immigration to Australia and North America, 1919–1978'' (U of New South Wales Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prohibition===
{{Main article|Prohibition in the United States}}
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the [[Progressive movement]] gradually caused local communities in many parts of Western Europe and North America to tighten restrictions of vice activities, particularly gambling, alcohol, and narcotics (though splinters of this same movement were also involved in racial segregation in the U.S.). This movement gained its strongest traction in the U.S. and its crowning achievement was the passage of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] and the associated [[Volstead Act]] which made illegal the manufacture, import and sale of beer, wine and hard liquor (though drinking was technically not illegal). The laws were specifically promoted by evangelical Protestant churches and the [[Anti-Saloon League]] to reduce drunkenness, petty crime, wife abuse, corrupt saloon-politics, and (in 1918), Germanic influences. The [[KKK]] was an active supporter in rural areas, but cities generally left enforcement to a small number of federal officials. The various restrictions on alcohol and gambling were widely unpopular leading to rampant and flagrant violations of the law, and consequently to a rapid rise of [[organized crime]] around the nation (as typified by Chicago's [[Al Capone]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Okrent|title=Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition|year=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781439171691}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prohibition in Canada|In Canada, prohibition]] ended much earlier than in the U.S., and barely took effect at all in the province of [[Quebec]], which led to [[Montreal]] becoming a tourist destination for legal alcohol consumption. The continuation of legal alcohol production in Canada soon led to a new industry in smuggling liquor into the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Hallowell, [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/prohibition/ "Prohibition in Canada"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rise of the speakeasy====

[[Speakeasy|Speakeasies]] were illegal bars selling beer and liquor after paying off local police and government officials.  They became popular in major cities and helped fund large-scale gangsters operations such as those of [[Lucky Luciano]], [[Al Capone]], [[Meyer Lansky]], [[Bugs Moran]], [[Moe Dalitz]], [[Joseph Ardizzone]], and [[Sam Maceo]]. They operated with connections to organized crime and liquor smuggling. While the U.S. Federal Government agents raided such establishments and arrested many of the small figures and smugglers, they rarely managed to get the big bosses; the business of running speakeasies was so lucrative that such establishments continued to flourish throughout the nation. In major cities, speakeasies could often be elaborate, offering food, live bands, and floor shows. Police were notoriously bribed by speakeasy operators to either leave them alone or at least give them advance notice of any planned raid.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Lerner, ''Dry Manhattan: Prohibition in New York City'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{Further information|1920s#Literature}}
The Roaring Twenties was a period of literary creativity, and works of several notable authors&lt;!-- no need for lists; see category if desired—including [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Willa Cather]], [[William Faulkner]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Carl Sandburg]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]] —--&gt; appeared during the period. [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' was a scandal at the time because of its explicit descriptions of sex.
Books that take the 1920s as their subject include:
*''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], set up in 1922 in the vicinity of New York City, is often described as the symbolic meditation on the "Jazz Age" in American literature.
*''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' by [[Erich Maria Remarque]] recounts the horrors of World War I and also the deep detachment from German civilian life felt by many men returning from the front.
*''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], primarily set up in post-World War I Princeton University, portrays the lives and morality of youth.
*''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'' by [[Ernest Hemingway]] is about a group of expatriate Americans in Europe during the 1920s.

===Solo flight across the Atlantic===
[[Charles Lindbergh]] gained sudden great international fame as the first pilot to fly solo and non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean, flying from [[Roosevelt Airfield]] ([[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], [[Long Island]]), New York to Paris on May 20 – May 21, 1927. He had a single-engine airplane, the "[[Spirit of St. Louis]]", which had been designed by [[Donald Hall]] and custom built by [[Ryan Aeronautical Company|Ryan Airlines]] of [[San Diego, California]]. His flight took 33.5 hours. The [[President of the French Republic|President of France]] bestowed on him the [[French Legion of Honor]] and, on his arrival back in the United States, a fleet of warships and aircraft escorted him to Washington, D.C., where President [[Calvin Coolidge]] awarded him the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].

===Sports===
The Roaring Twenties was the breakout decade for sports across the modern world. Citizens from all parts of the country flocked to see the top athletes of the day compete in arenas and stadia. Their exploits were loudly and highly praised in the new "gee whiz" style of [[sports journalism]] that was emerging; champions of this style of writing included the legendary writers [[Grantland Rice]] and [[Damon Runyon]] in the U.S. Sports literature presented a new form of heroism departing from the traditional models of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;David Imhoof, "The Game of Political Change: Sports in Göttingen during the Weimar and Nazi Eras", ''German History'', July 2009, Vol. 27 Issue 3, pp 374–394&lt;/ref&gt;

High school and junior high school students were offered to play sports that they hadn't been able to play in the past. Several sports, such as golf, that had previously been unavailable to the middle-class finally became available. Also, a notable motorsports feat was accomplished in Roaring Twenties as driver [[Henry Segrave|Henry Seagrave]], driving his car the [[Golden Arrow (car)|Golden Arrow]], reaches at the time in 1929 a record speed of 231.44&amp;nbsp; mph.

====Olympics====
Following the 1922 Latin American Games in Rio de Janeiro, IOC officials toured the region, helping countries establish national Olympic committees and prepare for future competition. In some countries, such as Brazil, sporting and political rivalries hindered progress as opposing factions battled for control of the international sport. The 1924 Olympic Games in Paris and the 1928 games in Amsterdam saw greatly increased participation from Latin American athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Cesar Torres, "The Latin American 'Olympic explosion' of the 1920s: Causes and consequences", ''International Journal of the History of Sport'', November 2006, Vol. 23#7 pp 1088–1111&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports journalism, modernity, and nationalism excited Egypt. Egyptians of all classes were captivated by news of the Egyptian national soccer team's performance in international competitions. Success or failure in the Olympics of 1924 and 1928 was more than a betting opportunity but became an index of Egyptian independence and a desire to be seen as modern by Europe. Egyptians also saw these competitions as a way to distinguish themselves from the traditionalism of the rest of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Shaun Lopez, "Football as National Allegory: Al-Ahram and the Olympics in 1920s Egypt", ''History Compass'', January 2009, Vol. 7 Issue 1, pp 282–305,&lt;/ref&gt;

====Balkans====
The Greek government of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] initiated a number of programs involving physical education in the public schools and raised the profile of sports competition. Other Balkan nations also became more involved in sports and participated in several precursors of the Balkan Games, competing sometimes with Western European teams. The Balkan Games, first held in Athens in 1929 as an experiment, proved a sporting and a diplomatic success. From the beginning, the games, held in Greece through 1933, sought to improve relations among Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Albania. As a political and diplomatic event, the games worked in conjunction with an annual Balkan Conference, which resolved issues between these often-feuding nations. The results were quite successful; officials from all countries routinely praised the games' athletes and organizers. During a period of persistent and systematic efforts to create rapprochement and unity in the region, this series of athletic meetings played a key role.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Kissoudi, "Sport, Politics and International Relations in the Balkans: the Balkan Games from 1929 to 1932", ''International Journal of the History of Sport'', November 2008, Vol. 25 Issue 13, pp 1771–1813&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
The most popular American athlete of the 1920s was baseball player [[Babe Ruth]]. His characteristic [[home run]] hitting heralded a new epoch in the history of the sport (the "[[Live-ball era]]"), and his high style of living fascinated the nation and made him one of the highest-profile figures of the decade. Fans were enthralled in 1927 when Ruth hit 60 home runs, setting a new single-season home run record that was not broken until 1961. Together with another up-and-coming star named [[Lou Gehrig]], Ruth laid the foundation of future [[New York Yankees]] dynasties.

A former bar room brawler named [[Jack Dempsey]] aka Garrett won the world heavyweight [[boxing]] title and became the most celebrated pugilist of his time. [[Enrique Chaffardet]] the [[Venezuela]]n [[Featherweight]] [[Boxing world champions|World Champion]] was the most sought-after [[Boxing|boxer]] in 1920s [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]]. [[College football]] captivated fans, with notables such as [[Red Grange]], [[running back]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], and [[Knute Rockne]] who coached [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]]'s football program to great success on the field and nationwide notoriety. Grange also played a role in the development of professional football in the mid-1920s by signing on with the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Chicago Bears]]. [[Bill Tilden]] thoroughly dominated his competition in [[tennis]], cementing his reputation as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. And [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] popularized [[golf]] with his spectacular successes on the links; the game did not see another major star of his stature come along until [[Arnold Palmer]] and then [[Jack Nicklaus]] in the early 1960s. Ruth, Dempsey, Grange, Tilden, and Jones are collectively referred to as the "Big Five" sporting icons of the Roaring Twenties.

===Organized Crime===

During the 19th century vices such as gambling, alcohol, and narcotics had been popular throughout the United States in spite of not always being technically legal. Enforcement against these vices had always been spotty. Indeed, most major cities established [[red-light district]]s to regulate gambling and prostitution despite the fact that these vices were typically illegal. However, with the rise of the [[Progressive Movement]] in the early 20th century, laws gradually became tighter with most gambling, alcohol, and narcotics outlawed by the 1920s. Because of widespread public opposition to these prohibitions, especially alcohol, a great economic opportunity was created for criminal enterprises. Organized crime blossomed during this era, particularly the [[American Mafia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mafia in the United States | website=History.com | url=http://www.history.com/topics/mafia-in-the-united-states}}&lt;/ref&gt; So lucrative were these vices that some entire cities in the U.S. became illegal gaming centers with vice actually supported by the local governments. Notable examples include [[Miami, Florida]] and [[Free State of Galveston|Galveston, Texas]].

Many of these criminal enterprises would long outlast the roaring twenties and ultimately were instrumental in establishing Las Vegas as a gaming center.

==Culture of Weimar Germany==
[[File:Bauhaus08Oct09.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Bauhaus Dessau, built from 1925 to 1926 to a design by [[Walter Gropius]] ]]
[[File: Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P062899, Berlin, Tanzkabarett im Europahaus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Europahaus, one of the hundreds of cabarets in Weimar Berlin, 1931]] 
[[Weimar culture]] was the flourishing of the arts and sciences that flourished in Germany during the [[Weimar Republic]], from  1918 until [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Weimar Culture: The Outsider as Insider'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[1920s Berlin]] was at the hectic center of the Weimar culture.  Although not part of Germany, German-speaking Austria, and particularly Vienna, is often included as part of Weimar culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Congdon, ''Exile and Social Thought: Hungarian Intellectuals in Germany and Austria, 1919–1933'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bauhaus]] was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts. Its goal of unifying art, craft, and technology became influential worldwide, especially in architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen James-Chakraborty,  ''Bauhaus Culture: From Weimar to the Cold War'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany, and Berlin in particular, was fertile ground for intellectuals, artists, and innovators from many fields. The social environment was chaotic, and politics were passionate.  German university faculties became universally open to [[Jewish]] scholars in 1918. Leading Jewish intellectuals on university faculties included physicist [[Albert Einstein]]; sociologists [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Herbert Marcuse]]; philosophers [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Edmund Husserl]]; sexologist [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]; political theorists [[Arthur Rosenberg]] and [[Gustav Meyer]]; and many others. Nine German citizens were awarded Nobel prizes during the Weimar Republic, five of whom were Jewish scientists, including two in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Niewyk|first=Donald L.|title=The Jews in Weimar Germany|year=2001|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-7658-0692-5|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sport took on a new importance as the human body became a focus that pointed away from the heated rhetoric of standard politics.  The new  emphasis reflected the  search for freedom by young Germans alienated from rationalized work routines.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore F. Rippey, "Athletics, Aesthetics, and Politics in the Weimar Press." ''German Studies Review'' (2005) 28#1: 85–106. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30038070?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==American politics==

{{See also|United States presidential election, 1920}}
The 1920s saw dramatic innovations in American political campaign techniques, based especially on new advertising methods that had worked so well selling war bonds during the [[First World War]]. Governor [[James M. Cox]] of Ohio, the Democratic Party candidate, made a whirlwind campaign that took him to rallies, train station speeches, and formal addresses, reaching audiences totaling perhaps 2,000,000 people. It resembled the [[William Jennings Bryan]] campaign of 1896. By contrast, the Republican Party candidate Senator [[Warren G. Harding]] of Ohio relied upon a "Front Porch Campaign."  It brought 600,000 voters to [[Marion, Ohio]], where Harding spoke from his home. Republican campaign manager [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]] spent some $8,100,000; nearly four times the money Cox's campaign spent. Hays used national advertising in a major way (with advice from adman [[Albert Lasker]]). The theme was Harding's own slogan "America First." Thus the Republican advertisement in ''Collier's Magazine'' for October 30, 1920, demanded, "Let's be done with wiggle and wobble." The image presented in the ads was nationalistic, using catchphrases like "absolute control of the United States by the United States," "Independence means independence, now as in 1776," "This country will remain American. Its next President will remain in our own country," and "We decided long ago that we objected to a foreign government of our people."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Sinclair, ''The Available Man: The Life behind the Masks of Warren Gamaliel Harding'' (1965) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

1920 was the first presidential campaign to be heavily covered by the press and to receive widespread newsreel coverage, and it was also the first modern campaign to use the power of [[Hollywood]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stars who traveled to Marion for photo opportunities with Harding and his wife. [[Al Jolson]], [[Lillian Russell]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Mary Pickford]], were among the celebrities to make the pilgrimage. Business icons [[Thomas Edison]], [[Henry Ford]] and [[Harvey Firestone]] also lent their cachet to the Front Porch Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;John Morello, ''Selling the President, 1920: Albert D. Lasker, Advertising, and the Election of Warren G. Harding'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  On election night, November 2, 1920, commercial radio broadcast coverage of election returns for the first time. Announcers at [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA-AM]] in Pittsburgh, PA read telegraph ticker results over the air as they came in. This single station could be heard over most of the Eastern United States by the small percentage of the population that had radio receivers.

[[Calvin Coolidge]] was inaugurated as President after the sudden death of President Warren G. Harding in 1923; he was re-elected in 1924 in a landslide against a divided opposition. Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made [[History of radio|radio history]] several times while president: his inauguration was the first [[Inauguration Day|presidential inauguration]] broadcast on radio; on 12 February 1924, he became the first American president to deliver a political speech on radio. [[Herbert Hoover]] was elected President in 1928.

===Decline of labor unions===
{{Main article|Labor history of the United States#Weakness of organized labor 1920–1929}}
Unions grew very rapidly during the war but after a series of failed major strikes in steel, meatpacking and other industries, a long decade of decline weakened most unions and membership fell even as employment grew rapidly. Radical unionism virtually collapsed, in large part because of Federal repression during World War I by means of the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and the [[Sedition Act of 1918]]. The major unions supported the third party candidacy of [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]] in 1924.

The 1920s marked a period of sharp decline for the labor movement. Union membership and activities fell sharply in the face of economic prosperity, a lack of leadership within the movement, and anti-union sentiments from both employers and the government. The unions were much less able to organize strikes. In 1919, more than 4,000,000 workers (or 21% of the labor force) participated in about 3,600 strikes. In contrast, 1929 witnessed about 289,000 workers (or 1.2% of the workforce) stage only 900 strikes. Unemployment rarely dipped below 5% in the 1920s and few workers faced real wage losses.&lt;ref&gt;, Robert Zieger,  ''American Workers, American Unions'' (1994) pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progressivism in 1920s===
{{main article|Progressive Era}}
The Progressive Era in the United States was a period of social activism and political reform that flourished from the 1890s to the 1920s. The politics of the 1920s was unfriendly toward the labor unions and liberal crusaders against business, so many if not all historians who emphasize those themes write off the decade. Urban cosmopolitan scholars recoiled at the moralism of prohibition and the intolerance of the nativists of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] ([[KKK]]), and denounced the era. Historian [[Richard Hofstadter]], for example, in 1955 wrote that prohibition, "was a pseudo-reform, a pinched, parochial substitute for reform" that "was carried about America by the rural-evangelical virus".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hofstadter, ''The Age of Reform'' (1955) p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as [[Arthur S. Link]] emphasized, the progressives did not simply roll over and play dead.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Link, "What Happened to the Progressive Movement in the 1920s?", ''American Historical Review'' Vol. 64, No. 4 (July 1959), pp. 833–851 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1905118 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Link's argument for continuity through the 1920s stimulated a historiography that found Progressivism to be a potent force.  Palmer, pointing to people like George Norris, say, "It is worth noting that progressivism, whilst temporarily losing the political initiative, remained popular in many western states and made its presence felt in Washington during both the Harding and Coolidge presidencies."&lt;ref&gt;Niall A. Palmer, ''The twenties in America: politics and history'' (2006) p 176&lt;/ref&gt; Gerster and Cords argue that "Since progressivism was a 'spirit' or an 'enthusiasm' rather than an easily definable force with common goals, it seems more accurate to argue that it produced a climate for reform which lasted well into the 1920s, if not beyond."&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Gerster and Nicholas Cords, ''Myth in American history'' (1977) p 203&lt;/ref&gt;  Even the Klan has been seen in a new light, as numerous social historians reported that Klansmen were "ordinary white Protestants" primarily interested in purification of the system, which had long been a core progressive goal.&lt;ref&gt;, Stanley Coben, "Ordinary white Protestants: The KKK of the 1920s", ''Journal of Social History'', Fall 1994, Vol. 28 Issue 1, pp 155–65&lt;/ref&gt;

====Business progressivism====
What historians have identified as "business progressivism", with its emphasis on efficiency and typified by [[Henry Ford]] and [[Herbert Hoover]]&lt;ref&gt;Joan Hoff Wilson, ''Herbert Hoover: Forgotten Progressive'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; reached an apogee in the 1920s. Wik, for example, argues that Ford's "views on technology and the mechanization of rural America were generally enlightened, progressive, and often far ahead of his times."&lt;ref&gt;Reynold M. Wik, "Henry Ford's Science and Technology for Rural America", ''Technology &amp; Culture'', July 1962, Vol. 3 Issue 3, pp 247–257&lt;/ref&gt;

Tindall stresses the continuing importance of the Progressive movement in the South in the 1920s involving increased democracy, efficient government, corporate regulation, social justice, and governmental public service.&lt;ref&gt;George B. Tindall, "Business Progressivism: Southern Politics in the Twenties", ''South Atlantic Quarterly'' 62 (Winter 1963): 92–106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George B. Tindall, ''The Emergence of the New South, 1913–1945'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; William Link finds political progressivism dominant in most of the South in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Link, ''The Paradox of Southern Progressivism, 1880–1930'' (1997) p 294&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise it was influential in Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Sealander, ''Grand Plans: Business Progressivism and Social Change in Ohio's Miami Valley, 1890–1929'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of women and of youth emphasize the strength of the progressive impulse in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen A. Flanagan, ''America Reformed: Progressives and Progressivisms, 1890s–1920s'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Women consolidated their gains after the success of the suffrage movement, and moved into causes such as world peace,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Zeiger, "Finding a cure for war: Women's politics and the peace movement in the 1920s", ''Journal of Social History'', Fall 1990, Vol. 24 Issue 1, pp 69–86 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3787631 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; good government, maternal care (the [[Sheppard–Towner Act]] of 1921),&lt;ref&gt;J. Stanley Lemons, "The Sheppard–Towner Act: Progressivism in the 1920s", ''Journal of American History'' Vol. 55, No. 4 (March 1969), pp. 776–786 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1900152 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; and local support for education and public health.&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Morris-Crowther, "Municipal Housekeeping: The Political Activities of the Detroit Federation of Women's Clubs in the 1920s", ''Michigan Historical Review'', March 2004, Vol. 30 Issue 1, pp 31–57&lt;/ref&gt; The work was not nearly as dramatic as the suffrage crusade, but women voted&lt;ref&gt;Kristi Andersen, ''After suffrage: women in partisan and electoral politics before the New Deal'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and operated quietly and effectively.  Paul Fass, speaking of youth, says "Progressivism as an angle of vision, as an optimistic approach to social problems, was very much alive."&lt;ref&gt;Paula S. Fass, ''The damned and the beautiful: American youth in the 1920s'' (1977)  p 30&lt;/ref&gt; The international influences which had sparked a great many reform ideas likewise continued into the 1920s, as American ideas of modernity began to influence Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Rodgers, ''Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age'' (2000) ch 9&lt;/ref&gt;

There is general agreement that the Progressive era was over by 1932, especially since a majority of the remaining progressives opposed the New Deal.&lt;ref&gt;Otis L. Graham, ''An Encore for Reform: The Old Progressives and the New Deal'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian politics==
Canadian politics were dominated federally by the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] under [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]. The federal government spent most of the decade disengaged from the economy and focused on paying off the large debts amassed during the war and during the era of railway over expansion. After the booming wheat economy of the early part of the century, the [[Canadian Prairies|prairie provinces]] were troubled by low wheat prices. This played an important role in the development of Canada's first highly successful [[third political party|third party]], the [[Progressive Party of Canada]] that won the second most seats in the [[Canadian federal election, 1921|1921 national election]]. As well with the creation of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] Canada achieved with other British former colonies autonomy; creating the British Commonwealth.

==End of the Roaring Twenties==

===Black Tuesday===
{{Main article|Wall Street Crash of 1929}}
The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones Industrial Stock Index]] had continued its upward move for weeks, and coupled with heightened [[speculation|speculative]] activities, it gave an illusion that the [[bull market]] of 1928 to 1929 would last forever. On October 29, 1929, also known as [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday]], stock prices on [[Wall Street]] collapsed. The events in the United States added to a worldwide [[depression (economics)|depression]], later called the [[Great Depression]], that put millions of people out of work across the world throughout the 1930s.

===Repeal of Prohibition===
The [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]], which repealed the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]], was proposed on February 20, 1933. The choice to legalize alcohol was left up to the states, and many states quickly took this opportunity to allow alcohol. Prohibition was officially ended with the ratification of the Amendment on December 5, 1933.

'''''Runny Babbit: A Billy Sook''''' is a children's book by [[Shel Silverstein]].  A work in progress for the better part of 20 years,&lt;ref name=Rogak&gt;{{citation|title=A Boy Named Shel|last=Rogak|first= Lisa|publisher=[[Thomas Dunne Books]]|year=2007|isbn=0-312-35359-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the book was published posthumously in 2005.  The book is largely composed of [[spoonerism]]s in rhyming verse.&lt;ref name=Rogak/&gt;

Other than speaking only in spoonerisms, Runny is a normal child. He has many friends, and two loving parents, his "Dummy and mad," who often remind him to "Shake a tower," "Dash the wishes," "Tush your breeth," "Rean your cloom," and other chores.

'''Sahaptian''' (also '''Sahaptianic''', '''Sahaptin''', '''Shahaptian''') is a two-language branch of the [[Plateau Penutian]] family spoken by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] peoples in the [[Columbia Plateau]] region of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[Idaho]] in the northwestern [[United States]].

==Family division==

Sahaptian includes 2 languages:

:1. '''[[Nez Perce language|Nez Perce]]''' (Niimi'ipuutímt, {{sc|aka}} Nez Percé, Nezperce)
::* Upper Nez Perce
::* Lower Nez Perce
:2. '''[[Sahaptin language|Sahaptin]]''' (Sħáptənəxw)
::* Northern Sahaptin group
:::* Northwest Sahaptin dialect cluster
:::* Northeast Sahaptin dialect cluster
::* Southern Sahaptin group ({{sc|aka}} Columbia River cluster)

Nez Perce has two main [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] (Upper and Lower). Sahaptin has considerably greater internal diversity with several different varieties.

Note that the terms ''Sahaptian'' (the family) and ''Sahaptin'' (the language) have often been confused and used interchangeably in the literature.

'''''Save Our History''''' is a television program sponsored by [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]. It is a national history education and preservation program that raises awareness and support for preserving local and national heritage. It partnered with Preserve America, a [[White House]] initiative created by [[Laura Bush]] on March 3, 2003, to encourage the preservation of the [[United States]]' cultural heritage. The show is hosted by [[Edward Herrmann]], and ''Save Our History: America's Most Endangered 1999'' is hosted by [[Noah Wyle]].

In 2006, ''Save Our History'' added the Teacher and Student of the Year Awards, given to those who help preserve historical sites in their communities. One of the sites included the first [[Union Army]] camp for [[African Americans]] in [[Cheltenham, Pennsylvania]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The other sites were the [[Mars Station, Pennsylvania|Mars Train Station]] in [[Mars, Pennsylvania]] and the [[Strand Theater (Zelienople)|Strand Theater]] in [[Zelienople, Pennsylvania]].

On October 15, 2016 ScanPyramids confirmed their first unknown void discoveries thanks to [[muon tomography]] in [[Great Pyramid of Giza|the Great Pyramid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/56510-photos-inside-great-pyramid-giza.html|title=In Photos: Looking Inside the Great Pyramid of Giza|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/scanning-the-pyramids-hidden-cavities-beneath-gizas-great-pyramid/ss-AAjeP6q?li=BBoPOOl&amp;parent-title=archaeologists-uncover-secrets-of-how-egyptians-built-the-great-pyramid-of-giza|title=Scanning the Pyramids: Hidden cavities beneath Giza's Great Pyramid|website=www.msn.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previously unknown cavity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Procureur|first=S.|date=2018-01-11|title=Muon imaging: Principles, technologies and applications|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment|volume=878|pages=169–179|doi=10.1016/j.nima.2017.08.004|issn=0168-9002}}&lt;/ref&gt; was confirmed on the North-Eastern Edge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/2016/10/15/03004-20161015ARTFIG00133-decouverte-de-deux-cavites-dans-la-grande-pyramide-de-kheops.php|title=Deux cavités découvertes dans la grande pyramide de Khéops|date=2016-10-15|work=FIGARO|access-date=2018-06-12|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; roughly at 110m high with similar void volume characteristics as a known "cave" located at 83m on the same edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kanaya|first=Ichi|last2=Kawae|first2=Yukinori|last3=Yasumuro|first3=Yoshihiro|last4=Chiba|first4=Fumito|date=2013-10-28|title=3D Reconstruction of the "Cave" of the Great Pyramid from Video Footage|pages=227–230|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258884202|doi=10.1109/DigitalHeritage.2013.6743739|isbn=978-1-4799-3170-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second void was discovered behind the chevrons area of [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Khufu]]'s North Face above the descending corridor. This area was investigated after thermal anomalies observation that led the team to position [[Muon tomography|muon]] emulsion plates in the descending corridor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hip.institute/press/HIP_INSTITUTE_CP2_EN.pdf|title=The " ScanPyramids " Project launch to crack the secret of the biggest Egyptian pyramids|last=HIP Institute|first=|date=2016-10-15|website=www.hip.institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/3010559/more-hidden-cavities-found-in-great-pyramid-of-giza/|title=More hidden ‘cavities’ found in Great Pyramid of Giza|work=Global News|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This void has been more investigated during the year 2017 in order to provide more information about its shape, size, and exact position.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Institute|first=H.

=== 2017 ===
During 2017 more [[Muon tomography|muons]] emulsion plates were positioned in the descending corridor and in [[Great Pyramid of Giza#Modern entrance|Al-Mamun's tunnel]]. The void behind the chevrons has been reconfirmed through different "point of views" and its characteristics have been refined. Named "ScanPyramids North-Face Corridor", this void is located between 17 and 23m from [[the Great Pyramid]]'s ground level, between 0,7m and 2m from the North Face. Its slope is either horizontal or upward slope and it has a corridor like shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Institute|first=H. I.

==  ScanPyramids Big Void ==
On November 2, 2017, the ScanPyramids team published in the scientific [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] its third discovery, named "ScanPyramids Big Void".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This previously unknown and gigantic void is located just above the known [[Great Pyramid of Giza#Grand Gallery|Grand Gallery]], in a circumscribed area. Its minimum length is 30m and it has a similar cross-section as the [[Great Pyramid of Giza#Grand Gallery|Grand Gallery]]. The ScanPyramids Big Void has been observed by three teams of physicists from different points of view (2 points of view in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza#Queen's Chamber|Queen's Chamber]] and from outside in front of the North Face). Each team has confirmed the [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] of this previously unknown void at certainty level above [[Standard deviation#Table|5 Sigma]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The three scientific institution specialized in particle physics have worked independently and each one used a different and complementary [[muography]] technique:

* [[Nagoya University]], [[Japan]]: Nuclear emulsion plates in the Queen's Chamber
* [[KEK|High Energy Accelerator Research Organization]] ([[KEK]]), [[Japan]]: Scintillator hodoscope in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza#Queen's Chamber|Queen's Chamber]]
* [[French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission|Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission]] ([[French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission|CEA]]), [[France]]: [[Muon]] telescopes with gas detectors positioned outside in front of [[Great Pyramid of Giza|the Great Pyramid]]'s North Face.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The team has been very cautious about its architectural nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/stunned-scientists-detect-suspected-hidden-chamber-with-1820054009|title=Stunned Scientists Detect Suspected Hidden Chamber Within Great Pyramid of Giza|last=Dvorsky|first=George|date=|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US|quote=We’re avoiding the word ‘chamber', we know that it’s a big void, but we’re not calling it a chamber}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was done for the void discovered behind the chevrons area (ScanPyramids North Face Corridor), new [[muography]] observations, from new angles, should be conducted in order to refine the Big Void's architectural characteristics (slope, shape).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7uk3mx/weve_brought_ancient_pyramid_experts_here_to/|title=AMA (Ask Me Anything) History - We've brought ancient pyramid experts here to answer your questions about the mysterious, recently-discovered voids inside Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza.

=== Egyptologists reactions ===
On November 2, 2017, the Egyptologist [[Zahi Hawass]], who published few weeks before, with [[Mark Lehner]] his latest book, ''Giza and the Pyramids: A definitive history'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo25022565.html|title=Giza and the Pyramids: A definitive history|last=Zahi Hawass|first=Mark Lehner|publisher=|year=October 2017|isbn=9780226425696|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; told the [[The New York Times|New York Times]]: “They found nothing...This paper offers nothing to Egyptology. Zero.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/science/pyramids-giza-void.html|title=Inside Giza’s Great Pyramid, Scientists Discover a Void|last=|first=|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en|quote=“They found nothing,” said Dr. Hawass, noting that such construction gaps had been known of for at least two decades. “This paper offers nothing to Egyptology. Zero.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, [[Khaled al-Anany]], Egyptian Minister of Antiquities said, during a press conference, that the void space found inside the Great [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Pyramid of Khufu]] by the ScanPyramids project is a new revelation that brought the world’s attention to [[Egypt]]. He added “What was discovered is new and larger than the known cavities, and we’ll continue in our scientific steps”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/khufu-pyramid-void-draws-world-attention-egypt-minister/|title=Khufu pyramid void draws world attention to Egypt: Minister - Egypt Independent|last=|first=|date=2017-11-04|work=Egypt Independent|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US|quote=“What was discovered is new and larger than the known cavities, and we’ll continue in our scientific steps,” Anany said}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[List of Egyptologists|Egyptologists]] have welcomed the discovery. Yukinori Kawae told [[National Geographic]] “This is definitely the discovery of the century...There have been many hypotheses about the pyramid, but no one even imagined that such a big void is located above the [[Great Pyramid of Giza#Grand Gallery|Grand Gallery]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/great-pyramid-giza-void-discovered-khufu-archaeology-science/|title=Mysterious Void Discovered in Egypt's Great Pyramid|last=|first=|date=2017-11-02|work=|access-date=2018-06-12|quote=“There have been many hypotheses about the pyramid, but no one even imagined that such a big void is located above the Grand Gallery.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/archeo-paleo/kheops-fausse-polemique-autour-de-la-decouverte-d-une-gigantesque-cavite-dans-la-grande-pyramide_118038|title=Kheops : Fausse polémique autour de la découverte d’une gigantesque cavité dans la grande pyramide|work=Sciences et Avenir|access-date=2018-06-12|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter der Manuelian]] from [[Harvard University]] said that “This is an exciting new discovery, and potentially a major contribution to our knowledge about [[Great Pyramid of Giza|the Great Pyramid]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/02/archaeolgists-discover-mysterious-void-deep-within-great-pyramid-of-giza|title=Archaeologists discover mysterious void deep within Great Pyramid of Giza|last=Sample|first=Ian|date=2017-11-02|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-12|quote=Peter Der Manuelian, professor of Egyptology and director of the Harvard Semitic Museum, said the discovery was “potentially a major contribution to our knowledge about the Great Pyramid.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vox.com"/&gt;

=== Physicists reactions ===
Lee Thompson, an expert in particle physics at the [[University of Sheffield]] (UK) told [[Science (journal)|Science]]: "The scientists have “seen” the void using three different [[muon]] detectors in three independent experiments, which makes their finding very robust."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/11/cosmic-rays-reveal-unknown-void-great-pyramid-giza|title=Cosmic rays reveal unknown void in the Great Pyramid of Giza|date=2017-11-01|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Morris, physicist at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] called the findings “pretty amazing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/science/pyramids-giza-void.html|title=Inside Giza’s Great Pyramid, Scientists Discover a Void|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Anderson who worked on [[Pyramid of Khafre|Khafre's Pyramid]] and was a member of the team of [[Luis Walter Alvarez]], the first scientist to use [[muography]] inside a pyramid in the 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alvarezphysicsmemos.lbl.gov/physics_pdfs/APM541-550.pdf|title=A proposal to "X-ray" the Egyptian Pyramids to Search for Presently Unknown Chambers|last=Alvarez|first=Luis Walter|date=1965-03-01|website=http://alvarezphysicsmemos.lbl.gov/|pages=39–102|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; said to [[Los Angeles Times|Los Angeles Time]], with a laugh: "I am very excited and very pleased,...I wish we had worked in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]], now that I look back on it”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-egypt-pyramid-giza-20171102-htmlstory.html|title=Using particle physics, scientists find hidden structure inside Egypt's Great Pyramid|last=Khan|first=Amina|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Session laws''' are the collection of [[statute]]s enacted by a [[legislature]] during a single session of that legislature, often published following the end of the session as a bound volume. The [[United States Statutes at Large]] are an example of session laws which are published biennially, because the United States Congress meets for two years per session. Session laws are typically published annually or biennially, depending on the length of the session of the legislature, which in turn typically depends on the frequency with which general elections of the legislature are held.

Laws that are enacted during a session may modify existing statutes of the jurisdiction, or may need to be added to the collection of statutes. If the agency responsible for printing updated statutes has not yet published a new collection of statutes containing the amendments or additions passed during a recent legislative session, people who need to refer to the changes may refer directly to the session laws. Furthermore, some laws may be passed during a legislative session that are not intended to apply to the general population. Such laws might never be added to the statutes of the jurisdiction, and might only be contained in the session laws.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Mark C. Patronsky, ''Laws Not Printed in the Statutes'' (Wisconsin Legislative Council Staff Information Memorandum, August 28, 1973), p. 2 (discussing Wisconsin session laws not published in the state statutes).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28270">'''Text and conversation''' is a [[theory]] in the field of [[organizational communication]] illustrating how [[communication]] makes up an [[organization]]. In the theory's simplest explanation, an organization is created and defined by communication. Communication "is" the organization and the organization exists because communication takes place.  The theory is built on the notion, an organization is not seen as a physical unit holding communication.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005"&gt;Miller, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Text and conversation theory puts communication processes at the heart of organizational communication and postulates, an organization doesn't contain communication as a "causal influence",&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt; but is formed by the communication within. This theory is not intended for direct application, but rather to explain how communication exists. The theory provides a [[conceptual framework|framework]] for better understanding organizational communication.

Since the foundation of organizations are in communication,&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1999"&gt;Taylor, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  an organization cannot exist without communication, and the organization is defined as the result of communications happening within its context. Communications begin with individuals within the organization discussing [[beliefs]], [[goal]]s, [[structure]]s, [[plans]] and relationships. These communicators achieve this through constant development, delivery, and translation of "text and conversation". The theory proposes mechanisms of communications are "[[literary work|text]] and "[[conversation]]".

== Definitions ==
The foundation of this theory is the concepts of text and conversation. Text is defined as the content of [[interaction]], or what is said in an interaction. Text is the meaning made available to individuals through a [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] or electronic mode of communication. Conversation is defined as what is happening behaviorally between two or more participants in the communication process. Conversation is the exchange or interaction itself.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1999" /&gt;

The process of the text and conversation exchange is [[reciprocal determinism|reciprocal]]: text needs conversation and vice versa for the process of communication to occur. Text, or content, must have context to be effective and a conversation, or discourse, needs to have a beginning, middle and end. Individuals create the beginning, middle and end by using [[punctuation]], [[bracketing]] or [[framing (social sciences)|framing]]. When conversation is coupled with text, or meaning, communication occurs.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1999" /&gt; Taylor submits this process is a translation process of: translation of text to conversation and the [[translation]] of conversation into text.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt;
*"text" = content and meaning
*"conversation" = [[discourse]] and exchange

== Theorist ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:James renwick taylor.jpg|thumb|James R. Taylor]] --&gt;

[[James R. Taylor]], introduced text and conversation theory in 1996 with [[François Cooren]], Giroux and Robichaud and then further explored the theory in 1999.  Taylor drew on the work of sociologist and educator [[John Dewey| John Dewey’s]] pragmatic view society exists not "by" but "in" communication.  Taylor followed the same principle, putting communication as the essence of an organization.
He was born in 1928 and is [[Professor Emeritus]] at the Department of Communication of the [[Université de Montréal]], which he founded in the early 1970s. Drawing from research in fields of [[Industrial and organizational psychology|organizational psychology]] ([[Karl E. Weick]]), [[ethnomethodology]] ([[Harold Garfinkel]]), Deirdre Boden), [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] ([[Alfred Schütz]]) and collective minding ([[Edwin Hutchins]]), Taylor formed the original text and conversation theory. This line of thought has come to be known as "The Montreal School" of organizational communication, sometimes referred to as TMS, and has been acknowledged as an original theory by authors such as [[Haridimos Tsoukas]], Linda Putman, and Karl E. Weick.
*Taylor said,"...organization emerges in communication, which thus furnishes not only the site of its appearance to its members, but also the surface on which members read the meaning of the organization to them." Taylor argues communication is the "site and emergence of organization."&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1999" /&gt;

== Foundational theories ==

=== Structuration theory ===
"[[Structuration theory]]" identifies how text and conversation theory evolved from this communication construct.  Proposed by [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]] (1984) in ‘’The Constitution on Society,’’ structuration theory, originated in the discipline of sociology.  Giddens’ theory has been adapted to the field of communication, particularly organizational communication; specifically, how and why [[structural change]]s are possible and the duality of formal and informal communication.
This theory is based on concepts of [[structure and agency]].  structure is defined as rules and resources of an organization; agency is the free will to choose to do otherwise than prescribed through structure.
*"structure":  is rules and resources, the reason we do things because of the structure of how we were raised (culture, sociological and [[physiological]]).  Giddens (1984) explains these rules as recipes or procedures for accomplishing tasks within an organization.  Resources have two subsets: allocative and authoritative, which can be leveraged to accomplish desired outcomes.  Allocative are quantitative resources, while authoritative are qualitative.
*"[[Agency (sociology)|agency]]": is the free will to choose to do otherwise. Agency is the reason people do things, because they have a choice&lt;ref&gt;Gidden, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the process individuals internalize actions and make choices, rather than making decisions because the structure says they should.  Structure is based on the formal organization and accepted policy. Agency is informal communication and individually based.
*"Dualism": mutually exclusive answer (i.e., either/or)
*"Duality": mutually constitutive answer (i.e., both/and)
*"[[Structuration]]": society itself is located in a [[duality of structure]] in which the enactments of agency become structures that, across time, produce possibilities for agency enactment.
*Another way explain it is structure is the context.
Structuration theory identifies [[structure and agency]] as coexisting. Formal rules and resources impact informal communication and discourse. This duality and coexistence ensures a cyclical nature between structure and agency, which has a cause and effect:  new structure and agency is created from the causal relationships of previous structure and agency decisions. The concept to understanding structuration is to understand to duality of structure &lt;ref&gt;Hoffman and Cowan, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity of Giddens’ theory and conversation and text theory is a mutual-existing and causal relationship of communication. The main difference, between the two, is structuration theory explains how communication impacts the organization, text and conversation, by means of structure and agency. Giddens' construct of structuration explains how mutually causal relationships constitute the essence of an organization. This concept illustrates how communication within an organization depends on the translation of meaning.

=== Conversation theory ===
"[[Conversation theory]]", proposed by [[Gordon Pask]] in the 1970s, identifies a framework to explain how [[scientific theory]] and interactions formulate the "construction of knowledge"&lt;ref&gt;Pask, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversation Theory is based on the idea [[social system]]s are symbolic and language-oriented.  Additionally, these systems are based on responses and interpretations, and the meaning interpreted by individuals via communication&lt;ref&gt;Pask, 1975, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory is based on interaction between two or more individuals, with unlike perspectives&lt;ref&gt;Scott, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of having unlike perspectives is that it enables a distinctive standpoint:  it permits the ability to study how people identify differences and understand meaning.  Additionally, these differences create shared and consensual pockets of interactions and communications as discussed in [[Structure-Organization-Process]].&lt;ref&gt;Maturana and Varela, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another idea of conversation theory is learning happens by exchanges about issues, which assists in making [[knowledge]] explicit.  In order for this to happen, Pask organized three levels of conversation, according to:&lt;ref name="cortland1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Pask.htm |title=Conversation Theory&amp;nbsp;— Gordon Pask |publisher=Web.cortland.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"[[Natural language]]": general discussion
*"[[Object language]]s": for discussing the subject matter
*"[[Metalanguages]]": for talking about learning/language
Additionally, to facilitate learning, Pask proposed two types of learning strategies.&lt;ref name="cortland1" /&gt;
*"Serialists": progress through a structure in a sequential fashion
*"[[Holist]]s": look for higher order relations
Ultimately, Pask found versatile learners neither favor one approach over the other. Rather, they understand how both approaches are integrated into the structure of learning. The similarities of conversation theory and text and conversation theory are they both focus on the foundational aspects of meaning. Specifically, how and why meaning is established and interpreted amongst individuals. However, the difference between the two theories is conversation theory specifically focuses on the dynamics of two people. Text and conversation theory is typically applied to at least two people. Conversation theory emphasizes the construct of knowledge of meaning and the [[Causality|cause and effect]] relationship that occurs as a result of [[Autodidacticism|self-learning]] from communication, based on meaning.

== Factors ==

=== Meaning ===
{{See also|Meaning-making}}
"Meaning management" is the control of "context" and "message" to accomplish a desired communication effect. According to Fairhurst, leaders are change agents&lt;ref name=fair2011&gt;{{harvnb|Fairhurst|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders define the value of the organization and shape communication by implementing unique organizational communication approaches. Within an organization, leaders and managers establish the framework for communication, which helps to manage meaning. "Leaders" provide information to followers, such as the organizations’ mission, vision, values, as well as its [[collective identity]] &lt;ref&gt;Fairhurst, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to leaders, "managers" are responsible for day to day [[problem solving]]. Their core framing tasks are solving problems and stimulating others to find solutions.&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt;

Individuals, regardless of positional authority, can manage meaning. Meaning management is to communicate with a specific goal by controlling the context and message&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt; Individuals utilizing meaning management are communicating and shaping the meaning by using the power of framing.

=== Culture ===
"[[Culture]]" is a unique set of behaviors, including language, belief and customs learnt from being raised in [[social group]]s or by joining a particular group throughout time. Culture defines context and is the social totality that defines behavior, knowledge, beliefs and [[social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]]. It is a set of shared values characterizing a specific organization. Fairhurst identifies culture as defining events, people, objects, and concepts.&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt; Communication and culture are intertwined. Shared language of a group links together individuals and joins common cultures. Culture influences [[mental model]]s. "Mental models" are the images in your mind about other people, yourself, substance and events.&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt;

Additionally, culture defines [[social interaction]]s and how individuals and groups interpret and apply context. Organizations with good communication foundation are able to interpret and differentiate individuals’ cultural discourses, as well as creatively combine and constrain these discourses.&lt;ref name="Fairhurst, 2007"&gt;Fairhurst, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ir defines the ideological basis for people and lays the foundation for how they frame and can be observed and described, but not controlled. It is defined by the group or individual accepting the specific patterns of behavior, knowledge, or beliefs  Individuals can shape culture and make changes over time, as long as they are clear about specific attitudes and behaviors that are desired &lt;ref name="Fairhurst, 2007"/&gt;  As [[Weick]] and Sutcliffe (2007) discussed, culture can be changed through symbols, values, and content&amp;nbsp;— organizations shape culture.  An [[organizational culture]] emerges from a set of expectations that matter to people, from things like [inclusion, exclusion, praise, positive feelings, [[social support]], isolation, care, indifference, excitement and anger &lt;ref&gt;Weick and Suitcliffe, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals are shaped by an organization's culture.  However, an organization has its own culture. According to Martin (1985), within that organizational culture, three forms of culture can result: integration, differentiation and fragmentation.
*"[[Social integration|Integration]]" (bring people together)
*"[[Differentiation (sociology)|Differentiation]]" (act or process by which people undergo change toward more specialized function)
*"[[Fragmentation (sociology)|Fragmentation]]" (process of state of breaking or being broken into smaller parts)
With Integration, all organizational members consistently share values and assumptions about work. As a result the members of the organization share uniquely organizational experiences and thus, a unique culture&lt;ref name="Martin, 1985"&gt;Martin, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
If differentiation occurs, cultures are not unitary. Sub-groups consistently share values and assumptions about work.  Members tend to operate in different areas, different projects and at different levels of the hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Martin, 1985" /&gt;
Cultures are often ambiguous if fragmentation happens. Individuals are interconnected with some members and disconnected with others. This creates inconsistently shared values and assumptions about the organization&lt;ref name="Martin, 1985" /&gt; As a result friendship/romantic as well as enemy/competitor type relationships are cut across an organization’s sub-groups.

=== Structure ===
Individuals who understand the structure and inner working of their organizations can leverage knowledge toward achieving communication goals. Likewise, organizations can also leverage their hierarchical structures to achieve targeted outcomes.
Two types of structures exist within an organization.
*"[[Hierarchical]]" (formal hierarchical structure, typical flow/pyramid chart)
*"Network" (informal structure, based on relationships, go to people, subject-matter experts)
Goldsmith and Katzenback (2008) explained organizations must understand the informal organization. For example, of being a part of an informal or formal structure, it is important for managers to learn to recognize signs of trouble in order to shape context as they attempt to coordinate meaning and solve day-to-day problems. Specific implications for [[organizational learning]] include enhanced performance, coordinated activity and structure, [[division of labor]] and collective goal setting &lt;ref name="BEA07"&gt;Bryan et al, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
While a formal organization is visually represented by a typical hierarchical structure, it visually shows how formal responsibilities are spread, as well as job dispersal and the flow of information&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith and Katzenback, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the informal organization embodies how people network to accomplish the job, via social relationships and connections or [[subject-matter expert]]s that are not represented on the organizational chart&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith and Katzenbach, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  By leveraging this informal organization, people within the organization are able to use their [[social network]] to access and shape the [[decision-making process]]es quicker, as well as establish cross-structural collaboration amongst themselves.
Additionally, by understanding and using both structures, leaders and managers are able to learn more about their people.  Interpreting all forms of communication, verbal and visual, whether you are a supervisor or a subordinate is invaluable.  The hierarchical and network structures can allow an organization to recognize signs of trouble from people, accomplish core framing tasks, and to be able to communicate with mindfulness and meaning.  By unlocking the value of an organization's structure, leaders and managers can use this knowledge to boost performance or achieve specific goals.&lt;ref name="BEA07"/&gt; Signs of trouble can be emotional, hidden, physical, or in plain sight.

=== Knowledge ===
Knowing individuals’ personalities, conflict tendencies, as well as their unique circumstances help an organization to understand its [[mental model]]s and cultural discourse.  Additionally, by noticing abnormalities and not being blind to details, an organization should be able to recognize signs of trouble within day-to-day operations and management, whether it is fraud, lack of maintenance standards, [[sexual harassment]], or even a poor framework for communication.
Understanding and the ability to recognize signs of trouble empower managers to employ the rules of reality construction:  control the context, define the situation, apply ethics, interpret uncertainty, and design the response, which leads to communicating by a structured way of thinking.&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt;

Ultimately, by understanding how an organization works, you enhance communication collectively.&lt;ref name="BEA07" /&gt; Additionally, by knowing how employees and relationships are shaped and the context that defines how each person interacts with one another, you can shape contagious emotions.
Basic building blocks of Taylor’s theories is the relationship of text and conversation, and how that relationship requires a "two-step translational process"&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt;
*translation One:  From text to conversation
*translation Two: From conversation to text
Following this translational process, text and conversation is transferred to organizational communication. If context, or text, defines the organization then ongoing introductions and meaning are crucial to define what is meant by the term organization.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt;
To examine this further, Taylor defined "six degrees of separation" to understand organizational communication:&lt;ref&gt;Taylor et al, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
*First Degree of Separation: Intent of speaker is translated into action and embedded in conversation.
*Second Degree of Separation: Events of the conversation are translated into a narrative representation, making it possible to understand the meaning of the exchange.
*Third Degree of Separation: The text is transcribed (objectified) on some permanent or semi-permanent medium (e.g., the minutes of a meeting are taken down in writing).
*Fourth Degree of Separation: A specialized language is developed to encourage and channel subsequent texts and conversations(e.g., lawyers develop specific ways of talking in court, with each other, and in documents).
*Fifth Degree of Separation: The texts and conversations are transformed into material and physical frames (e.g., laboratories, conference rooms, organizational charts, procedural manuals).
*Sixth Degree of Separation: The standardized form is disseminated and diffused to a broader public (e.g., media reports and representations of organizational forms and practices).

== Impact ==
This theory uses interactions of text and conversation to construct networks of relationships. By doing so, the theory enables a deep understanding of personal communication within an organization. Additionally, it explains how that communication ends up actually defining the organization, rather than the individuals within the organization. Taylor’s theory places more importance on personal communication, rather than individuals. The practical application, as a result, is communication behaviors can constitute how and what we think of an organization. Additionally, by manipulating communication processes, not only could structure be altered, but the entire organization could be changed as well&lt;ref name="Heath et al, 2006"&gt;Heath et al, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; whether change is beneficial or negative, is based on desired meaning, or context and message, people within the organization want to exchange and translate.

Taylor stresses the importance and impact of dialogue, specifically relating to how people interact with one another and interpret context. Taylor explains in Heath et al. (2006) that virtuous reasoning embodies entire discussions. Additionally, he points out dialogue should not prevent issues that arise from debate&lt;ref name="Heath et al, 2006"/&gt; Since 1993, Taylor’s theory has been the focus of more than six organizational communication books. Additionally, Taylor’s ideas are referred to as "The Montreal School" of organizational communication&lt;ref name="cortland1" /&gt; Within the field of communication, TMS has been recognized for its contributions to organizational communication as well as related disciplines. Books focusing on text and conversation theory have sold internationally&lt;ref name="cortland1" /&gt; One to the largest and simplest contributions this theory provided the communication academic field was the ability to describe and characterize and organization. From this, people could better understand and fully construct and organization’s identity.

== Weakness ==
According to Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), [[organizational learning]] is the study of how collectives adapt to, or fail to adapt to, their environments.  It utilizes tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge.
*"[[Tacit Knowledge]]": personal, contextual, subjective, implicit, and unarticulated
*"[[Explicit Knowledge]]": codified, systematic, formal, explicit, and articulated
Ultimately, organizational learning achieves enhanced performance, coordinated activity and structure, and achievement of collective goals by externalization and internalization.
*"[[Externalization]]": getting key workers to make their tacit knowledge the organization’s explicit knowledge that can be shared
*"[[Internalization]]": getting the organization’s explicit knowledge to become workers’ tacit knowledge
Text and conversation theory places significant challenges and burdens on the organization to articulate knowledge.  Whether knowledge is passed directly by individuals, up and down or horizontally on the formal or informal organizational structure, there is no guarantee text has proper context to be effective as conversation.  Additionally, conversation codes are influenced by how the organization ensures knowledge carriers pass information and communicate with purpose, message, and meaning.
How information is passed can be unclear, and consistently has to adapt to new challenges.  Some of these challenges, or factors, include how individuals and an organization adapt to meaning, culture, structure, and knowledge, in order to communicate.
Ultimately, within the organization itself, people are impacted by bias’ on group and individual levels.

"Problems with Group Learning"
*Responsibility bias:  belief of group members’ that someone else in the group will do the work
*[[Social desirability bias]]:  group members are reluctant to provide critical assessments for fear of losing face or relational status
*Hierarchical mum effect:  subordinates’ reluctance to provide negative feedback for fear of harming identifies of superiors
*[[Groupthink]]:  failure to consider decision alternatives
*Identification/[[ego defense]]:  highly identified group members begin to associate their identify with their group membership and will in turn refuse to see the group as wrong, and themselves by extension
"Problems with Individual Learning"
*[[Confirmation bias]]:  individuals seeks to confirm their own ideas, guesses and beliefs rather than seek dis-confirming information
*[[Hindsight bias]]:  individuals tend to forget when their predictions are wrong
*[[Fundamental attribution error]]:  individuals tend to attribute others shortcomings to their character, while attributing their own shortcomings to external forces

'''The Bris''' is the 69th episode of the sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]''. It is the fifth episode of the fifth season, and it first aired on October 14, 1993.

==Plot==
[[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]], [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]], [[George Costanza|George]], and [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] go to the hospital to meet friends who have just had a baby. At the hospital, George gets a parking spot right in front of the hospital. A mental patient jumps from the roof and lands on it. George attempts to get the hospital to pay for the car's damages, but the director refuses, insinuating that George is running a scam. Kramer stumbles into the wrong room at the hospital (1937 instead of 1397) and becomes convinced that he has seen a "pigman" (half-pig, half-man). He espouses a conspiracy theory concerning the government and genetic mutation leading to pigmen armies.

Jerry and Elaine agree to become [[godparents]] to the newborn baby. Jerry uses the role as a prompt to perform impersonations of [[Marlon Brando]]'s character from ''[[The Godfather]]'', but his friends are severely unimpressed. They are obligated to arrange the [[bris]], which involves booking a [[mohel]] and holding the baby during the [[circumcision]]. Kramer, disturbed by the concept of the bris, upsets the mother with grotesque descriptions of circumcision and seizes the baby in an unsuccessful rescue attempt. The mohel ([[Charles Levin (actor)|Charles Levin]]) is extremely irritable and high-strung, and implies that he was charged with malpractice due to a botched circumcision on at least one previous occasion. Made increasingly nervous by this, Jerry flinches as the circumcision gets under way, and the mohel cuts off Jerry's finger. The four go to the hospital, where the baby's parents have to break up a fight between Jerry and the mohel. Jerry's finger is stitched up. Kramer finds the "pigman" (whom he later discovers is actually "a fat little mental patient") and "liberates" him from the hospital. The "pigman" steals George's car, which was again conveniently parked.

The parents strip Jerry and Elaine of their role as godparents, deciding they prefer Kramer due to the concern he expressed for the baby. Pleased, Kramer performs an off-the-cuff impersonation of ''The Godfather'' which far eclipses Jerry's.

==Controversy==
[[Jason Alexander]], who plays the part of George Costanza, has described the character of the mohel as "disgusting" and "anti-Semitic in a hurtful way". After having read the first draft of the script, Alexander approached co-creator and executive producer [[Larry David]] and asked to be written out of the episode. When David said he would "soften" the character before they filmed the episode, Alexander agreed to stay in. However, he still has regrets about how the mohel was portrayed.

'''''The Journal of Sir Walter Scott''''' is a diary which the novelist and poet [[Walter Scott]] kept between 1825 and 1832.  It records the financial disaster which overtook him at the beginning of 1826, and the efforts he made over the next seven years to pay off his debts by writing bestselling books.  Since its first complete publication in 1890 it has attracted high praise, being considered by many critics one of the finest diaries in the language.

== Manuscript ==

The manuscript of the ''Journal'', "a handsome lockd volume" as Scott called it, is of quarto size and bound in vellum.  The handwriting displayed in it, especially after his final series of strokes, is so atrociously difficult that, according to the ''Journal'''s most recent editor, a perfectly accurate transcription is quite impossible.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Journal of Sir Walter Scott |editor1-first=W.

A hard word so spelld on the Authority of Miss Scott now Mrs. Lockhart}}

The manuscript was kept at [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]] after Scott's death, but was bought by the financier [[J. P. Morgan]] around 1900, and is now in the [[The Morgan Library &amp; Museum|Morgan Library]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/online/TheDiary/diary.asp?id=9 |title=The Diary: Three Centuries of Private Lives |publisher=The Morgan Library &amp; Museum |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==

In July 1825 Scott acquired a copy of the ''Diary of [[Samuel Pepys]]'', which had just been published for the first time, and according to his son-in-law [[John Gibson Lockhart|J. G. Lockhart]], "I never observed him more delighted with any book whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart (1896) p. 576.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year he read a manuscript copy of [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s 1821 journal and was impressed by Byron's plan of writing a desultory, unsystematic record of his actions, thoughts and memories, which combined the maximum of interest for the reader with the minimum of effort for the writer.  Inspired by these two models, he opened his own new diary on November 20, 1825 and wrote the first entry.&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart (1896) p. 572&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1998) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt (1981) p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Siege of Malta Rediscovered |last=Sultana |first=Donald E. |year=1977 |publisher=Scottish Academic Press |isbn=0707301319 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only two days later he noted doubts as to the financial stability of the publisher [[Archibald Constable]] &amp; Co., which concerned him greatly since he had a large stake in the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1998) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  His worst fears were realized the following year when Constable failed, bringing [[James Ballantyne]] &amp; Co., in which Scott was a partner, down with him.  Scott found himself personally liable for debts totalling more than £125,000.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Walter Scott: His Life and Personality |last=Pearson |first=Hesketh |year=1987 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |pages=220–228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He resolved to pay off the debts by his own labours as a novelist rather than accept bankruptcy, and the ''Journal'' records his unceasing efforts to do this as he writes a series of novels and histories, including ''[[Woodstock (novel)|Woodstock]]'', ''The Surgeon's Daughter'', ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]'', ''[[Anne of Geierstein]]'', ''[[Count Robert of Paris]]'', ''[[The Siege of Malta (novel)|The Siege of Malta]]'', ''[[Bizarro (Walter Scott)|Bizarro]]'', ''The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte'' and ''[[Tales of a Grandfather]]''.  Other disasters are recorded in the ''Journal'', such as the death of his wife in 1826, and a series of strokes which increasingly undermined his physical and mental powers.  In July 1828 he allowed the habit of keeping his journal to lapse for several months, but returned to the task from January 1829 to July 1829 and from May 1830 to May 1831.  In October 1831 he again resumed the ''Journal'', having been offered £1000 or £1500 by his publisher [[Robert Cadell]] for some record of his forthcoming voyage to [[Malta]] and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Letters of Sir Walter Scott 1831-1832 |editor1-first=H. J. C. |editor1-last=Grierson |year=1937 |publisher=Constable |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He finally abandoned work on it in [[Naples]] in April 1832, the last entry ending in the middle of a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1998) p. 800&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==

From the time of the ''Journal''’s first publication extraordinary claims have been made for it.  In 1891 [[Algernon Swinburne]] wrote that "The too long delayed publication of his ''Journal'' is in every way an almost priceless benefit; but as a final illustration and attestation of a character almost incomparably lovable, admirable, and noble, it is a gift altogether beyond price."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Prose and Poetry |last=Swinburne |first=Algernon |year=1897 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The biographer [[Hesketh Pearson]] called it "Perhaps the most valuable, certainly the most moving, of all his productions; and, since it displays a man whose goodness of heart balanced his greatness of mind, incomparably the most interesting work of its kind ever written."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson (1987) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[Virginia Woolf]], "Scott's Journals are the best life of Scott in existence...they contain Scott in his glory and Scott in his gloom...in a few passages Scott throws more light upon his genius and its limitations than all his critics in their innumerable volumes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woolf |first1=Virginia |year=1974 |title=The Moment and Other Essays |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |page=56 |isbn=0156619008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scott scholar David Hewitt agreed, writing that "There is no greater or more moving diary in English"; however he also made the point that its fine artistic shape cannot be credited to Scott, since he quite fortuitously took up the ''Journal'' as the tragedy of his last years was about to begin.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt (1981) p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;  The literary historian [[Oliver Elton]] believed that the ''Journal''’s high place in English literature was secure: "Whatever else of Scott's may lose its colour with time, the ''Journal'' cannot do so, with its accurate, unexaggerated language of pain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Survey of English Literature, 1780-1830 |last=Elton |first=Oliver |volume=1 |year=1965 |publisher=E. Arnold |page=357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lockhart believed that Scott knew his ''Journal'' would eventually be published, but he nevertheless called it "The most candid Diary that ever man penned".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1998) pp. xxiii-xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart (1896) p. 573&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of the ''Journal'''s candour has been taken up by many later critics.  [[C. S. Lewis]] considered that it was "One of the sincerest books in the world, and (what is not exactly the same thing) full of self-knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Selected Literary Essays |last=Lewis |first=C. S. |editor1-first=Walter |editor1-last=Hooper |year=1969 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521296803 |page=211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novelist [[John Buchan]] wrote that "It is one of the most complete expressions of a human soul that we possess… There is no reticence and no posturing, because he is speaking to his own soul…The greatest figure he ever drew is in the ''Journal'', and it is the man Walter Scott."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sir Walter Scott |last=Buchan |first=John |year=1961 |publisher=Cassell |pages=277–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eric Anderson (educator)|W. E. K. Anderson]] added the other side of the coin: "It is candid about Scott himself.  It is neither informative nor candid about other people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=W. E. K. |date=1973 |chapter=The ''Journal'' |editor1-last=Bell |editor1-first=Alan |title=Scott Bicentenary Essays: Selected Papers Read at the Sir Walter Scott Bicentenary Conference |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XTtbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=candid+about+Scott+himself.++It+is+neither+informative&amp;dq=candid+about+Scott+himself.++It+is+neither+informative&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cOQbVfjgGe_g7QbduIHoBA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA |location=Edinburgh and London |publisher=Scottish Academic Press |page=84 |isbn=070111987X |access-date=1 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novelist and critic [[A. N. Wilson]] judged it to be a truthful record of an unusual kind:&lt;blockquote&gt;There is nothing in it which can be contradicted by other biographical evidence…Yet there is something extremely ''conscious'' about it.  It is far more than a work of art.  Scott was not making himself out to be someone that he was not; rather, the Journal is his record of how he made himself conform to the heroic standards of his own fictions…Scott was intent on facing [his difficulties and sorrows] with the bravado of [[Balfour of Burley|Burley]] and the stubbornness of [[Jeanie Deans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Laird of Abbotsford: A View of Sir Walter Scott |last=Wilson |first=A. N. |year=1980 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0192117564 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] offered a dissenting view of the ''Journal'''s sincerity.  He thought that Scott, foreseeing eventual publication, took the opportunity to influence history's view of his financial crisis: "In these appallingly humiliating circumstances it evidently became more important than ever that he should preserve a noble image of himself ''in extremis'' for posterity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Life of Sir Walter Scott: A Critical Biography |last=Sutherland|first=John |year=1997 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=0631203176 |page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions ==

* J. G. Lockhart ''Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart.'' in 7 volumes (Edinburgh: Robert Cadell, 1837).  The last two volumes include substantial extracts from the ''Journal'', the text being based on a transcript by Lockhart's wife Sophia, Scott's daughter.  Many subsequent editions of Lockhart's biography have appeared.
* David Douglas (ed.) ''The Journal of Sir Walter Scott'' in 2 volumes (Edinburgh: David Douglas, 1890).  The task of establishing the text was left to Professor Hume Brown.  A revised edition in 1927 expands the notes.
* [[John Guthrie Tait]] and W. M. Parker (eds.)  ''The Journal of Sir Walter Scott'' in 3 volumes (Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd, 1939-1946).  The text was produced by collating the Douglas edition against a photocopy, held in the [[National Library of Scotland]], of the original manuscript.
* W. E. K. Anderson (ed.) ''The Journal of Sir Walter Scott'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972).  This was reissued as a paperback by Canongate Classics in 1998, with minor corrections and additions.  Anderson’s edition is amply annotated, but like the previous one was based on a photocopy.
* David Hewitt (ed.) ''Scott on Himself'' (Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, 1981). Includes extracts from the ''Journal'' comprising most of the entries from December 1825 to May 1826, edited from the original manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1998) pp. v-vi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copac.ac.uk/search?au=Walter+Scott&amp;ti=Journal+Walter+Scott&amp;sort-order=date |title=Copac catalogue entry |publisher=Copac |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Onion Field''''' is a 1973 nonfiction book by [[Joseph Wambaugh]], a sergeant for the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], chronicling the kidnapping of two [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] LAPD officers by a pair of criminals during a traffic stop and the subsequent murder of one of the officers.

== Crime ==
On the night of March 9, 1963, LAPD officers Ian Campbell (age 31) and [[Karl Francis Hettinger|Karl Hettinger]] (age 28), both former Marines, were riding in an unmarked "felony" car.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}&lt;!-- what's a felony car? --&gt; They pulled over a 1946 Ford coupe containing two suspicious-looking men at the corner of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="Krajicek, David J"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Justice Story: Murder in the Onion Field|author= Krajicek, David J. |work=Special to The News (New York Daily News)| date=March 25, 2008 |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/justice-story-article-1.249124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070408/ap_en_ot/obit_smith_3|title='Onion Field' killer dead at 76|accessdate=2007-04-08|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070410200844/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070408/ap_en_ot/obit_smith_3 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  two men, [[Gregory Powell (murderer)|Gregory Ulas Powell]] (age 30) and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a. "Jimmy Youngblood", age 32), had recently committed a string of robberies, and "each had a pistol tucked into his trousers."&lt;ref name="Krajicek, David J"/&gt; Powell, the driver, pulled a gun on Campbell, who "calmly told his partner, 'He has a gun in my back. Give him your gun.'" The two officers were then forced into Powell's car and, within 30 seconds after the traffic stop began, were driven north from Los Angeles on Route 99, to an onion field near [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], where Campbell was fatally shot.&lt;ref name="Krajicek, David J"/&gt; Hettinger was able to escape, running nearly four miles to reach a farmhouse.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"/&gt;

The killing occurred primarily because Powell assumed that the kidnapping of the officers alone already constituted a [[capital punishment|capital crime]] under the state's [[Federal Kidnapping Act|Little Lindbergh Law]]. However, Powell's interpretation was incorrect.  Under the Little Lindbergh Law kidnapping became a capital crime only if the victim were harmed or if a ransom were demanded. (Today, kidnapping in [[California]], where there is bodily harm short of death, is punishable either by imprisonment for 25 years to life, or by [[life imprisonment]] without the possibility of [[parole]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Aftermath ==
In April 1982, following the release from prison of Powell's accomplice, Jimmy Lee Smith, Valerie Campbell, daughter of the slain Officer Ian Campbell, contacted John Mancino, founder of Citizens for Truth, an organization that had recently led a successful petition effort to rescind the parole date of convicted assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, killer of presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy.

Mancino drafted a petition to have Powell's scheduled release rescinded and with Valerie Campbell's help collected 31,500 signatures in three-and-a-half weeks, which were submitted to the California Board of Prison Terms, along with several thousand letters. The parole board then held a hearing and eventually rescinded Powell's release date.

Following this, Powell's attorney was successful in convincing Solano County Superior Court Judge, Ellis Randall, to order Powell's release from prison in ten days, ruling that Citizens for Truth's public outcry was the sole reason Powell's release was rescinded, which at the time was legally improper. Valerie Campbell then joined Citizens for Truth's representatives, John Mancino and Dr. Howard Garber, along with the group's attorneys, in filing a legal brief in the First District Court of Appeals in San Francisco, demanding that Powell remain in prison.

The group prevailed both at the appeals court and the California Supreme Court, thereby leading to Powell's spending the rest of his life in prison, where he died in 2012.

On August 10, 2012, the intersection of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in Hollywood, the site of the officers' abduction, was named "Ian Campbell Square" in honor of the slain officer.  Additionally, a section of the Hollywood Freeway ([[California State Route 101]]) in Hollywood, from Hollywood Boulevard to Highland Avenue, was designated the "Ian J. Campbell Memorial Freeway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Onion Field Killer's Death Brings Closure for LAPD, Chief Says |date= August 13, 2012 |work= Los Angeles Times |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/08/onion-field-killer-lapd.html |access-date= April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Hettinger was able to escape, he felt scorned by his fellow officers and officials at the Los Angeles Police Department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/09/local/me-powers9 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Myrna | last=Oliver | title=John W. Powers, 90; Legendary Officer in LAPD for 31 Years | date=December 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suffered severe emotional trauma for both the initial incident and the following treatment. Eventually a [[police training]] video was made using his experience as an example of what {{em|not}} to do when stopping and approaching a vehicle.

Hettinger was forced to resign from the LAPD in 1966, after being accused of shoplifting. Years later, Hettinger was elected to serve as a Supervisor for Kern County, California, where he served multiple consecutive terms. He died of [[liver disease]] in 1994, at the age of 59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Malnic, Eric |work=Los Angeles Times| date= May 5, 1994 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-05/news/mn-53959_1_onion-field|title=Karl Hettinger; Survived 1963 'Onion Field' Attack|accessdate=  January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The suspects===
Powell was arrested on the night of the murder, after being spotted driving a stolen vehicle by California Highway Patrol officers. The following day, Smith was apprehended as well. The lead LAPD investigator on the case was Sergeant Pierce Brooks. Both suspects were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Ultimately, they received [[life sentence]]s. For each, the [[lower court]] sentence followed a second trial and several appeals. Their death sentences were vacated when the [[California Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[California v. Anderson]]'' (1972) that California's death penalty was [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Special to The News|title=The Justice Story: Murder in the Onion Field

====Powell====
{{main|Gregory Powell (murderer)}}

At a [[parole board]] hearing on January 27, 2010, Powell was denied parole. In a January 21, 2010 letter to state [[corrections]] officials, Los Angeles Police Union President Paul Weber urged the board to deny parole, calling Powell a "vicious murderer who has not yet paid his debt to society".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On October 18, 2011, the California State [[Parole Board]] denied [[compassionate release]] for Powell, who had been diagnosed with terminal [[prostate cancer]]. The board stated that Powell did not wish to be released from prison and was likely to be uncooperative if paroled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]] |date=October 18, 2011|title= 'Onion Field' Killer Will Not Be Released|work=Associated Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/us/onion-field-killer-will-not-be-released.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Powell died on August 12, 2012, at the [[California Medical Facility]] in [[Vacaville, California|Vacaville]]. He was 79 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 13, 2012|title='Onion Field' Killer Dies in Calif. Prison|work=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Smith====
Smith was initially released in 1982 but returned to prison several additional times on drug-related parole violations. In December 2006, he failed to report to his [[parole officer]], and a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] was issued for his arrest. In February 2007, a man matching Smith's description was detained by police in Los Angeles' [[Skid Row, Los Angeles, California|Skid Row]] area and eventually identified as Smith. He was arrested, charged with violating his parole, and sent to the Pitchess Detention Center in [[Castaic, California]]. On April 7, 2007, while in that facility, he died of an apparent [[heart attack]] at age 76.&lt;ref name="latobit"&gt;{{cite news|author=Quinones, Sam |date=April 7, 2007|title= Jimmy Lee Smith, infamous 'Onion Field' cop killer, dead at 76|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/jimmy-lee-smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and television adaptations ==
The book was adapted into an [[The Onion Field (film)|1979 film of the same name]] directed by [[Harold Becker]]. It starred [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] as Karl Hettinger, [[James Woods]] as Gregory Powell, [[Franklyn Seales]] as Jimmy Smith, and [[Ted Danson]] (in his film debut) as Ian Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/13/entertainment/la-et-mn-the-onion-field-murder-movie-ted-danson-james-woods-in-1979-20120813|title='The Onion Field' film played role in keeping killer behind bars|last=King|first=Susan|date=2012-08-13|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]]'s ''[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]]'' season 5 episode 9 titled "Chaos" (original airdate April 10, 2013) portrayed a reimagined version of the events that took place in ''The Onion Field''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Hitfix|author=Sepinwall, Alan|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-southland-chaos-the-onion-field|title=Review: 'Southland' - 'Chaos': The onion field|date= April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.southlandfirst.com/2013/04/southland-s5e9-chaos-review.html| date=April 12, 2013|work=SouthLand First|title=SouthLAnd S5E9 "Chaos" review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Adam-12]]'' episode "Killing Ground" was based on this incident. Officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed are kidnapped by two armed robbers on the run. The only difference is Malloy and Reed are able to escape and turn the tables on their captors.

'''''Thrilling Adventures''''' was a monthly American [[pulp magazine]] published from 1931 to 1943.&lt;ref name=ah&gt;Doug Ellis, John Locke, John Gunnison, ''The Adventure House Guide to the Pulps''. Adventure House, 2000,  {{ISBN|1886937451}} (p. 270).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Thrilling Adventures'' was created in 1931 by editor [[Leo Margulies]]&lt;ref name=pfest&gt;{{cite news|title=Leo Margulies at 115!|url=http://www.pulpfest.com/2015/06/leo-margulies-at-115/|accessdate=13 December 2015|work=Pulpfest|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was patterned after the pulp [[Adventure (magazine)|''Adventure'']]. It was one of 16 pulps that Margulies founded that incorporated the adjective "Thrilling" in the title. (The company that published the ''Thrilling'' titles eventually changed its name to [[Thrilling Publications]].)&lt;ref name=pfest/&gt; The first edition of ''Thrilling Adventures'' was published in December 1931.

''Thrilling Adventures'' published fictional stories, mostly of the adventure and sports genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Dinan|title=Sports in the Pulp Magazines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LvwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=13 December 2015|date=1 September 1998|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-0767-2|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued as a monthly until 1943, when it was reduced to a bimonthly, and the final issue was the November 1943 edition.&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt; A total of 139 issues were published during its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thrilling Adventures|url=http://www.pulpmags.org/thrilling_page.html|work=The Pulp Magazines Project|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Cross did his undergraduate education at [[Hampden–Sydney College]], receiving his B.A. in 1899.

==Works==
One major work of Cross' was ''A List of Books and Articles, Chiefly Bibliographical, Designed to Serve as an Introduction to the Bibliography and Methods of English Literary History'', first published in 1919; it would go through numerous editions, renamed from the 7th onwards as the ''Bibliographical Guide to English Studies''. Following his death it was expanded by Donald F. Bond as the ''Reference Guide to English Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Chaumié|first=Marthe|title=Bond (Donald F.) &amp;mdash; A Reference guide to English studies|pages=193&amp;ndash;194|journal=Bulletin de documentation bibliographique|year=1963|url=http://bbf.enssib.fr/consulter/bbf-1963-03-0177-001.pdf|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published a number of journal articles and a monograph on the [[Arthurian legends]].&lt;ref name="Speculum"/&gt;

Cross' final work, the ''Motif-Index of Early Irish Literature'', whose compilation he had begun more than five decades earlier at the inspiration of Fred N. Robinson, was published post-humously as part of [[Indiana University Bloomington]]'s Folklore Series in 1952. [[Stith Thompson]], who visited him in late 1951, reported that he worked literally until the day he died reading the [[galley proof]]s in order to complete the corrections.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{citation|first=Stith|last=Thompson|title=A Folklorist's Progress: Reflections of a Scholar's Life|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1996|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tR89afJ7sjQC&amp;pg=PA272 272]|isbn=9781879407091}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth H. Jackson]] praised the ''Motif-Index'' as "enormously comprehensive and so extremely useful".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Jackson|first=Kenneth H.|jstor=2846800|title=Reviewed work(s): Motif-Index of Early Irish Literature by Tom Peete Cross|journal=Speculum|volume=29|issue=3|date=July 1954|pages=548&amp;ndash;551|doi=10.2307/2846800}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, William Sayers would half a century later criticise it as being limited by its "original conceptual categories, where such modern notions as ideology, gender, physical aberrance, the abject and the like are absent".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Medieval Irish Language and Literature: An Orientation for Arthurians|last=Sayers|first=William|journal=Arthuriana|volume=17|issue=4|year=2007|pages=70&amp;ndash;80|url=http://www.arthuriana.org/access/MSubscribe/17-4/04_17.4sayers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Cross was born in 1879 in [[Nansemond County, Virginia|Nansemond County]], [[Virginia]] to Thomas Hardy Cross and Eleanor Elizabeth Wright. His father was a planter.&lt;ref name="NationalCyclopedia"/&gt; He had one younger brother, [[Hardy Cross]], who would go on to achieve fame in the field of [[structural engineering]] for his development of the [[moment distribution method]]. He and his brother both did their preparatory education at [[Norfolk Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Eaton|first=Leanard K.|title=Hardy Cross: American engineer|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-252-02989-9|pages=4&amp;ndash;6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross was married to Elizabeth Weathers Cross. He had two daughters, Ellen Elizabeth Cross and Evelyn Douglas Cross. The former married music scholar [[Storm Bull]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/461500882.html?dids=461500882:461500882&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=May+19%2C+1939&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Misses+Evelyn+and+Ellen+Cross+Will+Be+Brides&amp;pqatl=google|title=Misses Evelyn and Ellen Cross Will Be Brides|date=1939-05-19|accessdate=2011-07-08|periodical=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/461793932.html?dids=461793932:461793932&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+06%2C+1939&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Many+Enjoying+Fall+Season+at+Virginia+Resort&amp;pqatl=google|title=Many Enjoying Fall Season at Virginia Resort|last=Cass|first=Judith|date=1939-10-06|accessdate=2011-07-08|periodical=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his career, Cross retired to a farm in [[Aylett, Virginia]], where he lived until his death.&lt;ref name="NationalCyclopedia"/&gt; Late in life, he suffered a heart attack, and his poor health kept him from being able to climb stairs, but he still continued his work on his ''Motif-Index''.&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt; After his death, his wife moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]], where she lived with Bull and her daughter until her own death in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Obituary: Elizabeth Weathers Cross|date=1957-12-09|accessdate=2011-07-08|periodical=Chicago Tribune|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/566010162.html?dids=566010162:566010162&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Dec+09%2C+1957&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Obituary+2+--+No+Title&amp;pqatl=google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{BibleHistory}}

The '''World English Bible''' (also known as the '''WEB''') is a free updated revision of the [[American Standard Version]] (1901). It is one of the few [[public domain]], present-day English translations of the entire [[Bible]], and it is freely distributed to the public using electronic formats. The Bible was created by volunteers using the ASV as the base text as part of the ebible.org project through Rainbow Missions, Inc., a Colorado nonprofit corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stason.org/TULARC/education-books/bible-world-english/index.html#.URfUivKt90E Michael Paul Johnson - World English Bible Translation FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The World English Bible claims to be one of the few English-language Bibles custom translated to be understood by most English-speakers worldwide, eliminating the need for [[data processing|data-processing]] based or [[computer operating system]]-specific internationalizations. Work on the World English Bible began in 1997 and it was first known as the ''American Standard Version 1997''.

The World English Bible project was started in order to produce a modern English Bible version that is not copyrighted, does not use archaic English (such as the [[KJV]]), and is not translated into [[Basic English]] (such as the ''[[Bible In Basic English]]''). The World English Bible follows the American Standard Version's decision to [[transliteration|transliterate]] the [[Tetragrammaton]], but uses "[[Yahweh]]" instead of "[[Jehovah]]" throughout the Old Testament. The British and Messianic editions as well as the Apocryphal books and New Testament use the traditional forms (e.g., the LORD).

The translation also includes the following [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocryphal]] books (in the following order):
# [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]]
# [[Judith]]
# [[Book of Esther#Additions to Esther|Additions to Esther]] (additions found in the [[LXX]] namely Esther 10:4 – 16:24)
# [[Wisdom]] (also known as the Wisdom of Solomon)
# [[Ecclesiasticus]] (or Sirach)
# [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]]
# [[Epistle of Jeremy]] (or the Letter of Jeremy)
# [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children|Prayer of Azarias]] (Daniel 3:24–97 in the LXX &amp; [[Vulgate]])
# [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]] (Daniel 13 in the LXX &amp; Vulgate)
# [[Bel and the Dragon]] (Daniel 14 in the LXX &amp; Vulgate)
# [[I Maccabees]]
# [[II Maccabees]]
# [[1 Esdras]]
# [[Prayer of Manasses]]
# [[Psalm 151]]
# [[III Maccabees]]
# [[IV Maccabees]]
# [[2 Esdras]]

==Translation philosophy==
The work is based on the 1901 ''[[American Standard Version]]'' English translation, the Greek ''[[Byzantine text-type|Majority Text]]'', and the Hebrew ''[[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]]'' with some minor adjustments made because of alternate readings found in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] and the [[Septuagint]]. These alternate readings are usually ignored or restricted to the footnotes. The translation process included seven passes of editing and proofreading for each book. An initial automated pass updated approximately 1,000 archaic words, phrases and grammatical constructs. The first manual pass added quotation marks (the ASV had none) and other punctuation and compared the translation to the Greek and Hebrew texts in areas where significant textual variants or meanings were unclear.

==Critical reception==
Evangelical site GotQuestions.org praised the WEB for being "a modern, free, and public domain English translation of the Bible" while also criticising the translation's sentence structure as "not always in the most natural-sounding and free-flowing English". The site suggests the lack of physical print copies has made the translation difficult for widespread adoption by Christian communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gotquestions.org/World-English-Bible-WEB.html|title=What is the World English Bible (WEB)?|author=Got Questions?|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Provident Planning web site uses the World English Bible because it is free of copyright restrictions and because the author considers it to be a good translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.providentplan.com/1023/why-i-use-the-world-english-bible-web-version/|title=Why I use the World English Bible (WEB) Version|author=Corey|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible Megasite review of the World English Bible says it is a good revision of the American Standard Version of 1901 (ASV) into modern English, which also corrects some textual issues with the ASV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biblemegasite.com/why-web.html|title=David's Review of the World English Bible|author=David|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World English Bible is widely published in digital formats by a variety of publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://WorldEnglish.Bible|title=World English Bible|author=Michael Paul Johnson|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olivetree.com/store/product.php?productid=42749|author=Olive Tree Bible Software|title=World English Bible (WEB), Ecumenical|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/world-english-bible-web-audio-holy-scriptures/id669896123?mt=8|title=World English Bible WEB Audio Holy Scriptures|author=Li Liangpu|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
