The '''2MASX J00482185-2507365 occulting pair''' is a pair of overlapping spiral [[galaxies]] found in the vicinity of [[NGC 253]], the ''Sculptor Galaxy''. Both galaxies are more distant than NGC 253, with the background galaxy, [[2MASX J00482185-2507365]] ('''PGC 198197'''), lying at redshift z=0.06, about 800 million light-years from Earth, and the foreground galaxy lying between NGC 253 and the background galaxy (0.0008 &lt; z &lt; 0.06).&lt;ref name=Holwerda&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2646 arXiv:0810.2646v1] ; '''An extended dust disk in a spiral galaxy; An occulting galaxy pair in ANGST''' ;  {{bibcode|2008arXiv0810.2646H}} ; ''B. W. Holwerda, W. C. Keel, B. Williams, J. J. Dalcanton, R. S. de Jong'' ; '''''15 Oct 2008''''&lt;/ref&gt;

This pair of galaxies illuminates the distribution of galactic dust beyond the visible arms of a spiral galaxy. The heretofore unexpected extent of dust beyond the starry limits of the arms shows new areas for extragalactic astronomical study. The dusty arms extend 6 times the radii of the starry arms of the galaxy, and are shown silhouetted in HST images against the central and core sections of the background galaxy.&lt;ref name=DP&gt;Astronomy; '''Galaxy's Dark Secret Exposed''' ; ''Daniel Pendick'' ; pp.20 Vol.37 Issue.1 January 2009 ;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''meridian 6° east of [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich]]''' is a line of [[longitude]] that extends from the [[North Pole]] across the [[Arctic Ocean]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Southern Ocean]], and [[Antarctica]] to the [[South Pole]].

The 6th meridian east forms a [[great circle]] with the [[174th meridian west]].

==From Pole to Pole==
Starting at the [[North Pole]] and heading south to the [[South Pole]], the 6th meridian east passes through:

'''"Apollo-Soyuz"''' was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] brand of [[cigarette]]s which were manufactured by the ''"Java Tobacco Factory"'' in [[Moscow]], Soviet Union and [[Philip Morris USA]] in the [[United States]]. Today it is owned and manufactured by the Krasnodar Tobacco Factory, a Russian subsidiary of [[Altria]].

==History==
To honor the joint Soviet-American flight of the Soyuz-Apollo, a series of postage stamps and envelopes with the stamp first day covers, postcards, photo albums, as well as cigarettes under the name ''"Apollo-Soyuz"'' with the famous [[Types of tobacco|Virginia]] tobacco from the American company [[Altria|Philip Morris]] were issued to be made.

The brand was introduced for the occasion of the joint Soviet-American [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] mission in July 1975.&lt;ref name="airandspace.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/apollo-soyuz-commemorative-cigarettes%C2%A0 |title=Commerative Cigarettes |last=Hanser |first=Kathleen |date=July 8, 2015 |website= airandspace.si.edu|publisher=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/cigarettes-apollo-soyuz|title=Cigarettes, Apollo-Soyuz|date=18 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kommersant"&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=24850 «Кто лучше держит марку»] // Журнал «Деньги» № 36 (289) от 13.09.2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The cigarettes went on sale in the Soviet Union on July 15, 1975, the day the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] was launched, and later in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kovels.com/collectors-questions/russian-cigarettes|title=Russian Cigarettes - Collectors Questions - Collectors Questions|website=www.kovels.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cigarettes were manufactured for 5 years, during this time the Moscow factory released an order of 500 million cigarettes, although it was difficult to actually acquire a pack due to a trade deficit in the USSR.&lt;ref name="kommersant"/&gt; In the astronauts city Leninsk (nowadays called [[Baikonur]]) the cigarettes could be bought freely at 1.5 [[Soviet ruble]]s per pack (at the time this was considered quite expensive). In other cities of the USSR, the cigarettes were instantly bought and resold by [[Speculation|speculators]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segodnya.ua/news/293109.html «Проект „Союз—Аполлон“: Из „русского“ и „американца“ сделали космических гермафродитов»] // Segodnya.ua&lt;/ref&gt; The cigarettes were popular in the Soviet Union, a total of 3 billion were exported there. In the United States however, the brand found little appeal, mainly because the brand was expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/27/business/talking-deals-fast-russian-sale-by-philip-morris.html|title=Talking Deals;   Fast Russian Sale By Philip Morris|date=27 September 1990|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19750814&amp;id=IvlYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VkYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3511,2327452&amp;hl=nl|title=The Victoria Advocate - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturing of the brand was discontinued in 1980 upon expiry of the term of the license agreement between Philip Morris and Glavtabakom.&lt;ref name="kommersant"/&gt;

Cigarette manufacturing resumed in 1995 by the Krasnodar Tobacco Factory, owned by Philip Morris. In 1996 the factory was arranged in a full technological cycle of production, and since then the cigarettes are manufactured there.

On July 17, 1998 the production of a new cigarette called ''"Apollo Alliance Special"'', which were more expensive than the original, was started.&lt;ref name="kommersant"/&gt; On April 1 of 2000, production began of the ''"Apollo Alliance Special Lights Bookstore"'' cigarettes (retail price per pack 9-10 [[Ruble|Russian rubles]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesspress.ru/newspaper/article_mId_39_aId_20295.html «„Союз Аполлон Лайтс“ от Philip Morris»] // Деловая Пресса, № 7 (24) от 03.04.2000&lt;/ref&gt;), who were claimed to be a low-[[tar]] and [[nicotine]] cigarettes (8&amp;nbsp;mg tar and 0.6&amp;nbsp;mg nicotine per cigarette).

==Packaging==
The cigarette pack features a blue circle with a rendering of the docked Apollo-Soyuz spacecraft inside it, and bears English writing in blue and Russian in red. On one side it says:  ''"Apollo Soyuz commemorative brand,"'' and on the other ''"Soyuz Apollo"''. On one edge of the pack are the words, ''"Developed by Philip Morris Inc. U.S.A. and Glavtabak, U.S.S.R. in commemoration of U.S./Soviet space cooperation"'' in English and Russian, along with the English words, ''"Made in U.S.S.R., Tava Factory, Moscow."'' Glavtabak was the Soviet State Tobacco Agency. The other edge displays the U.S. Surgeon General's warning that cigarettes are dangerous to your health.&lt;ref name="airandspace.si.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/vintage-cigarette-boxes-feature-designs-from-the-soviet-1640217578|title=Vintage Cigarette Boxes Feature Designs From The Soviet Space Program|first=Vincze|last=Miklós|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Markets==
Apollo-Soyuz was only sold in the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], but since its re-introduction it is still sold in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zigsam.at/B_ApolloSoyuz.htm|title=Apollo Soyuz|website=www.zigsam.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zigsam.at/B_SoyuzApollo.htm|title=Soyuz Apollo|website=www.zigsam.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cigarety.by/brand.php?n=10&amp;l=0&amp;p=0&amp;w=APOLLO+|title=Brands|website=www.cigarety.by}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
===Video games===
Apollo-Soyuz cigarettes appeared in the game [[Escape from Tarkov]] where the brand is called ''"Apollon Soyuz"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://escapefromtarkov.gamepedia.com/Apollon_Soyuz_cigarettes|title=Apollon Soyuz cigarettes|website=Escape from Tarkov Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''applicability domain''' (AD) of a [[QSAR]] model is the physico-chemical, structural or biological space, knowledge or information on which the training set of the model has been developed, and for which it is applicable to make predictions for new compounds.

The purpose of AD is to state whether the model's assumptions are met and for which chemicals the model can be reliably applicable. In general, this is the case for [[interpolation]] rather than for [[extrapolation]]. Up to now there is no single generally accepted algorithm for determining the AD: a comprehensive survey can be found in a Report and Recommendations of ECVAM Workshop 52.&lt;ref&gt;Netzeva T, Worth A, Aldenberg T, Benigni R, Cronin M, Gramatica P, Jaworska J, Kahn S, Klopman G, Marchant C, Myatt G, Nikolova-Jeliazkova N, Patlewicz G, Perkins R, Roberts D, Schultz T, Stanton D, van de Sandt J, Tong W, Veith G, Yang C: Current status of methods for defining the applicability domain of (Quantitative) Structure–Activity Relationships. Altern Lab Anim 2005, 33: 1-19&lt;/ref&gt; There exists a rather systematic approach for defining interpolation regions.&lt;ref&gt;Jaworska J, Nikolova-Jeliazkova N, Aldenberg T: QSAR applicabilty domain estimation by projection of the training set descriptor space: a review. Altern Lab Anim 2005, 33(5):445-459&lt;/ref&gt; The process involves the removal of outliers and a probability density distribution method using kernel-weighted sampling. 
Another widely used approach for the structural AD of the regression QSAR models is based on the leverage calculated from the diagonal values of the hat matrix of the modeling molecular descriptors.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson AC, Plots, Transformations and Regression, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1985, p.282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tropsha A, Gramatica P, Gombar VK, The importance of being Earnest: Validation is the absolute essential for successful application and interpretation of QSPR models. QSAR Comb.Sci. 2003, 22: 69-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gramatica P, Principles of QSAR models validation: internal and external QSAR Comb.Sci. 2007, 26(5): 694-701&lt;/ref&gt; 
A recent rigorous benchmarking study of several AD algorithms identified standard-deviation of model predictions as the most reliable approach.&lt;ref&gt;Tetko IV, Sushko I, Pandey AK, Zhu H, Tropsha A, Papa E, Oberg T, Todeschini R, Fourches D, Varnek A. Critical assessment of QSAR models of environmental toxicity against Tetrahymena pyriformis: focusing on applicability domain and overfitting by variable selection. J Chem Inf Model. 2008 Sep;48(9):1733-46.&lt;/ref&gt;
To investigate the AD of a training set of chemicals one can directly analyse properties of the [[multivariate statistics|multivariate]] descriptor space of the training compounds or more indirectly via [[distance]] (or similarity) metrics. When using distance metrics care should be taken to use an orthogonal and significant vector space. This can be achieved by different means of feature selection and successive [[principal components analysis]].

Previously known as the '''American Society for Information Science and Technology''' (2000–2013), the organization sponsors an [[Academic conference|annual conference]] as well as several [[Periodical literature|serial publications]], including the ''[[Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology]]'' (JASIST).  The organization provides administration and communications support for its various divisions, known as special-interest groups or '''SIGs'''; provides administration for geographically defined chapters; connects job seekers with potential employers; and provides organizational support for [[continuing education]] programs for information professionals.&lt;ref name="asist-about"/&gt;

== History ==
[[Watson Davis]] formed the ''Documentation Institute'' in 1935,  which changed its name to the American Documentation Institute on 13 March 1937 with the collaboration of [[Atherton Seidell]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Claire K. &amp; Garwig, Paul L. (1969). History of the American Documentation Institute-A Sketch. ''American Documentation'', 20(2), 152-160.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was first concerned with [[microfilm]] and its role as a vehicle for the dissemination of information.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web
 | title = History of ASIS&amp;T

 | accessdate = 22 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725022140/http://www.asist.org/history.html| archivedate= 25 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ADI early on worked toward the development of microfilm readers and cameras. Their first microfilm laboratories were located in the U.S.[[United States National Agricultural Library|Department of Agriculture Library]] in Washington, DC and the Institute distributed materials through the newly created Bibliofilm Service.

ADI established the Auxiliary Publication Program, which during its 30-year history released nearly 10,000 documents covering a wide range of subjects. The program enabled authors in the fields of physical, natural, social, historical and information sciences to publish and distribute research papers that were either too long, typographically complex or expensive to be published in journals using existing technology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/trs/trsadi.html "American Documentation Institute Reports"]. [[Library of Congress]], [https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/trs/trsover.html "Technical Reports and Standards Unit"].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, the Photoduplication Service at the Library of Congress took over the operation and became the source point for distributing ADI materials and in 2009 this material found its home in the Library's Technical Reports and Standards Unit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/trs/trsadi.html#collection "ADI Collection"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/trs/trsover.html "Technical Reports and Standards Unit"].&lt;/ref&gt;

1950s was the transition to Modern Information Science:In 1952 the Bylaws were amended to allow individuals to become members due to the number of people that were engaged in the development of new principles and techniques. The goal was to make ADI a group that was concerned with all elements and problems of information science not just libraries. During this time there were increased interests and developments of automatic devices for searching, storage and retrieval.&lt;ref name="asist-about"/&gt;

In January 1968, ADI became the '''American Society for Information Science'''.  The change was made to represent the organization’s interest in "all aspects of the information transfer process" such as, "designing, managing and using information systems and technology."&lt;ref name=history/&gt;  In 2000 the organization updated its name, adding ''Technology'' to embrace the prevalence and increasing centrality of [[online database]]s and other technical aspects of the information profession.  In 2013 the organization was renamed as the Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&amp;T) to reflect its international membership.  Today, the organization comprises professionals from various fields including engineering, linguistics, librarianship, education, chemistry, computer science and medicine.  The members share "a common interest in improving the ways society stores, retrieves, analyzes, manages, archives and disseminates information ".&lt;ref name="asist-about"/&gt;

1970s was The Move to Online Information: During this time many institutions are making the move from batch processing to online modes, from mainframe computers to more modern computers. With the advancement of technology the traditional boundaries began to fade and library schools started to add "information" in the titles of their programs. ASIS sponsored a bicentennial conference which focused on the role of information in the country's development. The group also participated in the planning and implementation of the White House Conference on Library and Information Services. ".&lt;ref name="asist-about"/&gt;

1980s brings is the beginning of the popularity of Personal Computers: This is the first time individuals can access large databases, such as Grateful Med at the National Library of Medicine, and user-oriented services such as Dialog and Compuserve on their personal computers. ASIS created groups on office information, personal computers, international information issues and  rural information services in response to the changing environment. Eventually other groups were created, such as: non-print media, social sciences, energy and the environment, and community information systems. ASIS also added its first non-North American Chapters. ".&lt;ref name="asist-about"/&gt;

ASIS&amp;T Today: The group continues to grow and change. In the 2000s the group's name changes twice; first in 2000 to  American Society for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&amp;T)in order to reflect the range of its members; then in 2013 to Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&amp;T) to reflect its growing international membership. ASIS&amp;T is involved in the forefront of in examining the technical bases, social consequences, and theoretical understanding of online databases. They also study the effects of widespread use of databases in government, industry, and education, and the development of information databases on the Internet and World Wide Web ".&lt;ref name="asist-about"/&gt;

== Mission ==
In a world where "information is of central importance to personal, social, political, and economic progress", ASIS&amp;T seeks to advance the [[information science]]s and [[information technology]] by providing focus, opportunity, and support to information professionals and [[information organization]]s.&lt;ref name="missionvision"&gt;{{cite web

== Vision ==
To establish an information professionalism in the world by: Advancing knowledge about information; Providing analysis of ideas;; Valuing theory, research, applications, and service; Nurturing new perspectives, interests, and ideas; Increasing public awareness of the information sciences and technologies and their benefits to society."&lt;ref name="missionvision"/&gt;

== Membership ==
Originally membership was based on representatives nominated by scientific societies, professional associations, foundations, and government agencies.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  Changes made to the bylaws in 1952 opened the organization to any individual with interest in the dissemination of information.  Today, fee-based memberships can be either individual or institutional, with no formal requirements to join as an individual.  Similar to most organizations of its kind, ASIS&amp;T offers benefits to its members in the form of subscriptions to publications, access to job assistance services (JobLine); and discounts to ASIS&amp;T-sponsored events.

== Publications ==
In 1966, ADI began publication of the [[Annual Review of Information Science and Technology]]. Its successor organizations continued publishing the annual review under that title until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asis.org/news/ARISTcease.html|title=ARIST to Cease Publication|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asist-pubs"&gt;{{cite web

===JASIST===
ADI decided in 1950 to create a journal modeled after the defunct ''Journal of Documentary Reproduction'', which had been published by the [[American Library Association]] from 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=233737|year=1938|title=Journal of Documentary Reproduction|journal=Bulletin of the Medical Library Association|volume=26|issue=4|pages=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/asis62.html|title=THE LANDSCAPE OF INFORMATION SCIENCE: THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AT 62|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADI published the journal ''American Documentation''.&lt;ref&gt;Tate, V. (1950). Introducing American Documentation, a quarterly review of ideas, techniques, problems, and achievements in documentation. ''American Documentation'', 1(1), 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; from 1950 until 1968, when ADI changed its name as an organization and renamed ''American Documentation'' as the ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science''. In 2000, the society changed names again, and the journal followed suit, becoming the current [[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]].

==Naming==
Although the name ''Boaty McBoatface'' was originally proposed in a March 2016 online poll to name the ship, it was eventually named [[RRS Sir David Attenborough|RRS ''Sir David Attenborough'']].&lt;ref name=nameourship&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603115954/https://nameourship.nerc.ac.uk/|archivedate=3 June 2016|url=https://nameourship.nerc.ac.uk/|website=nameourship.nerc.ac.uk|publisher=[[Natural Environment Research Council]]|author=Anon|year=2016|location=Swindon|title=#NameOurShip}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nerc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2016/18-ship/|title=£200m polar research ship named in honour of Sir David Attenborough|website=NERC|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former BBC Radio Jersey presenter James Hand jokingly suggested Boaty McBoatface, a name the public liked and that quickly became the most popular choice. The name has been described as a homage to Hooty McOwlface, an owl named through an "Adopt-A-Bird" programme in 2012 that became popular on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boaty McBoatface tops poll but will vote be scuppered?|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boaty-mcboatface-tops-poll-but-will-vote-be-scuppered-mmgddzn9z|work=The Times|author=Tom Whipple|url-access=limited|quote=Yet the runaway winner was RSS Boaty McBoatface, itself an homage to the owl that was named Hooty McOwlface after a similar exercise.|date=16 April 2016|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Boaty McBoatface'' was the most popular suggestion in the #NameOurShip poll,&lt;ref name=nameourship/&gt; the suggestion to use the name for the [[mother ship]] was not followed,&lt;ref name=BBC35860760&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-35860760|author=Anon |title=Boaty McBoatface instigator 'sorry' for ship name suggestion |publisher=BBC|date=21 March 2016 |accessdate=6 June 2016|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Minister for Universities and Science, [[Jo Johnson]], announced that the ''Boaty McBoatface'' name would be used for one of the submersibles aboard ''Sir David Attenborough'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/05/06/boatymcboatface-to-live-on-as-yellow-submarine-science-minister/|title= 'BoatyMcBoatface' to live on as yellow submarine, science minister Jo Johnson announces|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|year=2016|first=Sarah|last=Knapton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CHARISSA''' (derived from 'CHARged particle Instrumentation for a Solid State Array') is a nuclear structure research collaboration originally conceived,  initiated and partially built by Dr. William Rae of the University of Oxford (retired) and now run by the School of Physics and Astronomy at the [[University of Birmingham]], UK. The other members of the collaboration are the [[University of Surrey]] with occasional contributions from LPC CAEN and [[Ruđer Bošković Institute]], Zagreb. The collaboration is funded by the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC).

==Experiments==

The CHARISSA collaboration carries out experiments at many of the world's leading research centres. Due to the nature of the research experiments performed must be undertaken with the use of a particle accelerator and complex detection systems. The group probes the structure of nuclei.

The '''calculation of glass properties''' ('''glass modeling''') is used to predict [[glass]] properties of interest or glass behavior under certain conditions (e.g., during production) without experimental investigation, based on past data and experience, with the intention to save time, material, financial, and environmental resources, or to gain scientific insight. It was first practised at the end of the 19th century by A. Winkelmann and [[Otto Schott|O. Schott]]. The combination of several glass models together with other relevant functions can be used for [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[six sigma]] procedures. In the form of [[statistical analysis]] glass modeling can aid with [[accreditation]] of new data, experimental procedures, and measurement institutions (glass laboratories).

==History==
Historically, the calculation of glass properties is directly related to the founding of glass [[science]]. At the end of the 19th century the physicist [[Ernst Abbe]] developed equations that allow calculating the design of optimized optical [[microscope]]s in [[Jena]], [[Germany]], stimulated by co-operation with the optical workshop of [[Carl Zeiss]]. Before Ernst Abbe's time the building of [[microscope]]s was mainly a work of art and experienced craftsmanship, resulting in very expensive optical [[microscope]]s with variable quality. Now Ernst Abbe knew exactly how to construct an excellent microscope, but unfortunately, the required [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] and [[Prism (optics)|prisms]] with specific ratios of [[refractive index]] and [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] did not exist. Ernst Abbe was not able to find answers to his needs from glass artists and engineers; glass making was not based on science at this time.&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite book |author=Vogel, Werner |title=Glass chemistry |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |year=1994 |isbn=3-540-57572-3 |edition=2nd revised }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879 the young glass engineer [[Otto Schott]] sent Abbe glass samples with a special composition ([[lithium]] silicate glass) that he had prepared himself and that he hoped to show special [[optics|optical]] properties. Following measurements by Ernst Abbe, Schott's glass samples did not have the desired properties, and they were also not as homogeneous as desired. Nevertheless, Ernst Abbe invited Otto Schott to work on the problem further and to evaluate all possible glass components systematically. Finally, Schott succeeded in producing homogeneous glass samples, and he invented [[borosilicate glass]] with the optical properties Abbe needed.&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt; These inventions gave rise to the well-known companies [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] and [[Schott Glass]] (see also [[Timeline of microscope technology]]). Systematic glass research was born. In 1908, Eugene Sullivan founded glass research also in the United States ([[Corning (city), New York|Corning]], [[New York (state)|New York]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.corning.com/inside_corning/our_heritage.aspx# |title=Eugene Sullivan and Corning Glass Works |access-date=2007-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013152045/http://corning.com/inside_corning/our_heritage.aspx# |archive-date=2007-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of glass research it was most important to know the relation between the glass composition and its properties. For this purpose Otto Schott introduced the '''additivity principle''' in several publications for calculation of glass properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winkelmann A. |author2=Schott O. |title=Über die Elastizität und über die Druckfestigkeit verschiedener neuer Gläser in ihrer Abhängigkeit von der chemischen Zusammensetzung |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=51 |pages=697 |year=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winkelmann A. |author2=Schott O. |title=Über thermische Widerstandscoefficienten verschiedener Gläser in ihrer Abhängigkeit von der chemischen Zusammensetzung |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=51 |issue= |pages=730 |year=1894 |doi=10.1002/andp.18942870407|bibcode = 1894AnP...287..730W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winkelmann A. |author2=Schott O. |title=Über die specifischen Wärmen verschieden zusammengesetzter Gläser |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=49 |page=401 |year=1893 |doi=10.1002/andp.18932850702|bibcode = 1893AnP...285..401W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle implies that the relation between the glass composition and a specific property is linear to all glass component concentrations, assuming an [[ideal mixture]], with ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' representing specific glass component concentrations and related coefficients respectively in the equation below. The additivity principle is a simplification and only valid within narrow composition ranges as seen in the displayed diagrams for the refractive index and the viscosity. Nevertheless, the application of the additivity principle lead the way to many of Schott’s inventions, including optical glasses, glasses with low thermal expansion for cooking and laboratory ware ([[borosilicate glass|Duran]]), and glasses with reduced freezing point depression for mercury [[thermometer]]s.

Schott and many scientists and engineers afterwards applied the additivity principle to experimental data measured in their own laboratory within sufficiently narrow composition ranges ('''local glass models'''). This is most convenient because disagreements between laboratories and non-linear glass component interactions do not need to be considered. In the course of several decades of systematic glass research thousands of [[glass]] compositions were studied, resulting in millions of published glass properties, collected in [[glass databases]]. This huge pool of experimental data was not investigated as a whole, until Bottinga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2475/ajs.272.5.438 |author1=Bottinga Y. |author2=Weill D.F. |title=The viscosity of magmatic silicate liquids: a model for calculation |journal=Am.

In contrast to the models by Schott the global models consider many independent data sources, making the model estimates more reliable. In addition, global models can reveal and quantify ''non-additive'' influences of certain glass component combinations on the properties, such as the ''mixed-alkali effect'' as seen in the adjacent diagram, or the ''boron anomaly''. Global models also reflect interesting developments of glass property measurement [[accuracy]], e.g., a decreasing accuracy of experimental data in modern scientific literature for some glass properties, shown in the diagram. They can be used for accreditation of new data, experimental procedures, and measurement institutions (glass laboratories). In the following sections (except melting enthalpy) ''[[empirical]]'' modeling techniques are presented, which seem to be a successful way for handling huge amounts of experimental data. The resulting models are applied in contemporary engineering and research for the calculation of glass properties.

Non-empirical (''[[deductive]]'') glass models exist.&lt;ref&gt;Milos B. Volf: "Mathematical Approach to Glass" Glass Science and Technology, vol. 9, Elsevier, 1988, {{ISBN|0-444-98951-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often not created to obtain reliable glass property predictions in the first place (except melting enthalpy), but to establish relations among several properties (e.g. [[atomic radius]], [[atomic mass]], [[Chemical bond|chemical bond strength and angles]], [[Valence (chemistry)|chemical valency]], [[heat capacity]]) to gain scientific insight. In future, the investigation of property relations in deductive models may ultimately lead to reliable predictions for all desired properties, provided the property relations are well understood and all required experimental data are available.

==Methods==
Glass properties and glass behavior during production can be calculated through [[statistical analysis]] of [[glass databases]] such as GE-SYSTEM&lt;ref name="GE-SYSTEM"&gt;[http://www.smartdata.cn/en/ges2010/index.html GE-SYSTEM]&lt;/ref&gt;
SciGlass&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciglass.info/ SciGlass] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016044859/http://www.sciglass.info/ |date=2007-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Interglad,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newglass.jp/interglad_n/gaiyo/info_e.html Interglad]&lt;/ref&gt; 
sometimes combined with the [[finite element method]]. For estimating the melting enthalpy thermodynamic databases are used.

===Linear regression===
[[Image:refractive index SiO2 Na2O.gif|250px|thumb|Refractive index in the system SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. [[dummy variable (statistics)|Dummy variables]] can be used to quantify systematic differences of whole dataseries from one investigator.&lt;ref name=errors/&gt;]]

If the desired glass property is not related to [[crystallization]] (e.g., [[liquidus temperature]]) or [[phase separation]], [[linear regression]] can be applied using common [[polynomial]] functions up to the third degree. Below is an example equation of the second degree. The ''C''-values are the glass component concentrations like Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or CaO in percent or other fractions, the ''b''-values are coefficients, and ''n'' is the total number of glass components. The glass main component [[silica]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is excluded in the equation below because of over-parametrization due to the constraint that all components sum up to 100%. Many terms in the equation below can be neglected based on [[correlation]] and [[Statistical significance|significance]] analysis. Systematic errors such as seen in the picture are quantified by [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variables]]. Further details and examples are available in an online tutorial by Fluegel.&lt;ref&gt;A. Fluegel: [http://glassproperties.com/principle/Statistics_Glass_2007.pdf Statistical Regression Modeling of Glass Properties - A Tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Glass Property} = b_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n \left( b_iC_i + \sum_{k=i}^n b_{ik}C_iC_k \right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Non-linear regression===
[[Image:TL-SiO2-Na2O-CaO.gif|250px|thumb|Liquidus surface in the system SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-CaO using disconnected peak functions based on 237 experimental datasets from 28 investigators. Error = 15 °C.&lt;ref name=liquidus&gt;[http://glassproperties.com/liquidus/ Glass Liquidus Temperature Calculation using disconnected peak functions]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[liquidus temperature]] has been modeled by [[non-linear regression]] using [[neural networks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-3093(02)01859-8|title=A machine learning approach to the estimation of the liquidus temperature of glass-forming oxide blends|year=2003|last1=Dreyfus|first1=C|journal=Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids|volume=318|pages=63|bibcode = 2003JNCS..318...63D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and disconnected peak functions.&lt;ref name=liquidus/&gt; The disconnected peak functions approach is based on the observation that within one [[primary crystalline phase]] field linear regression can be applied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hanni J.B. |author2=Pressly E. |author3=Crum J.V. |author4=Minister K.B.C. |author5=Tran D. |author6=Hrma P. |author7=Vienna J.D. |title=Liquidus temperature measurements for modeling oxide glass systems relevant to nuclear waste vitrification |journal=Journal of Materials Science |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=3346–57 |year=2005 |doi=10.1557/JMR.2005.0424|bibcode = 2005JMatR..20.3346H }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at eutectic points sudden changes occur.

===Glass melting enthalpy===
The glass melting enthalpy reflects the amount of energy needed to convert the mix of raw materials ([[glass batch|batch]]) to a melt glass. It depends on the batch and glass compositions, on the efficiency of the furnace and heat regeneration systems, the average residence time of the glass in the furnace, and many other factors. A pioneering article about the subject was written by Carl Kröger in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kröger, Carl |title=Theoretischer Wärmebedarf der Glasschmelzprozesse (Theoretical heat demand of glass melting processes) |journal=Glastechnische Berichte |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=202–14 |year=1953 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finite element method===
For modeling of the glass flow in a glass melting furnace the [[finite element method]] is applied commercially,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsl.cz/en/products/furnace-design.html Glass Service, Furnace Design]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brochure: [http://www.fluent.com/solutions/brochures/glass.pdf Flow modeling software for the glass industry]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Fluent Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; based on data or models for [[viscosity]], [[density]], [[thermal conductivity]], [[heat capacity]], absorption spectra, and other relevant properties of the glass melt. The finite element method may also be applied to glass forming processes.

===Optimization===
It is often required to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimize]] several glass properties simultaneously, including production costs.
&lt;ref name="GE-SYSTEM"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://glassproperties.com/optimization/ Glass property optimization]&lt;/ref&gt; This can be performed, e.g., by [[simplex search]], or in a spreadsheet as follows:
# Listing of the desired properties;
# Entering of models for the reliable calculation of properties based on the glass composition, including a formula for estimating the production costs;
# Calculation of the squares of the differences (errors) between desired and calculated properties;
# Reduction of the sum of square errors using the Solver option&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solver.com/suppstdsolver.htm Excel Solver]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Microsoft Excel]] with the glass components as variables. Other software (e.g. Microcal [[Origin (data analysis software)|Origin]]) can also be used to perform these [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimizations]].
It is possible to weight the desired properties differently. Basic information about the principle can be found in an article by Huff ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1973.tb12356.x|title=Computerized Prediction of Glass Compositions from Properties|year=1973|last1=Huff|first1=N. T.|last2=Call|first2=A. D.|journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society|volume=56|pages=55|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of several glass models together with further relevant technological and financial functions can be used in [[six sigma]] optimization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2993">The '''Canfield Ocean''' model was proposed by geochemist [[Donald Canfield]] to explain the composition of the ocean in the middle to late [[Proterozoic]]. His theory has been coined the 'Canfield Ocean' and remains one of the cornerstone theories of ocean oxygen composition during that time.

In a seminal paper published in 1998 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'',&lt;ref name="Canfield 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1998|title=A new model for Proterozoic ocean chemistry|url=[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v396/n6710/full/396450a0.html Abstract] [http://ebme.marine.rutgers.edu/HistoryEarthSystems/HistEarthSystems_Fall2008/Week5b/Canfield_Nature_1998.pdf PDF]|journal=Nature|volume=396|issue=6710|pages=450–453|doi=10.1038/24839|author=Canfield, D.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canfield argued that the ocean was [[ocean anoxia|anoxic]] and [[Hydrogen sulfide|sulfidic]] during the time of the [[Boring Billion]], and that those conditions affected the mineral deposition of iron-rich [[Banded iron formation]]s (BIF). Prior to the Canfield Ocean theory, it was believed that the ocean became oxygenated during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]]. The presence of oxygen in the deep ocean made the formation of BIF impossible, which is seen in ocean sediment records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holland|first=Heinrich D.|date=2006-06-29|title=The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6165">'''Conoscopy''' (from  [[Ancient Greek]] ''κῶνος'' (konos) "cone, spinning top, pine cone" and ''σκοπέω'' (skopeo) "examine, inspect, look to or into, consider") is an optical technique to make observations of a transparent specimen in a cone of converging rays of light. The various directions of light propagation are observable simultaneously .

A '''conoscope''' is an apparatus to carry out ''conoscopic observations'' and measurements, often realized by a [[microscope]] with a Bertrand lens for observation of the ''direction's image''. The earliest reference to the use of ''conoscopy'' (i.e., observation in convergent light with a polarization microscope with a [[Bertrand lens]]) for evaluation of the optical properties of [[liquid crystals|liquid crystalline phases]] (i.e., orientation of the optical axes) is in 1911 when it was used by Mauging to investigate the alignment of [[nematic]] and [[nematic|chiral-nematic]] phases.&lt;ref&gt;Ch. Maugin: "Sur les cristaux liquides de Lehmann", Bull. Soc. Min. 34(1911), pp. 71&lt;/ref&gt; 

A beam of convergent (or divergent) light is known to be a linear superposition of many plane waves over a cone of solid angles. The raytracing of Figure 1 illustrates the basic concept of ''conoscopy'': transformation of a directional distribution of rays of light in the front [[focal plane]] into a lateral distribution (''directions image'') appearing in the back [[focal plane]] (which is more or less curved). The incoming elementary parallel beams (illustrated by the colors blue, green and red) are converging in the back [[focal plane]] of the [[lens (optics)|lens]] with the distance of their focal point from the [[optical axis]] being a (monotonous) function of the angle of beam inclination.

|Figure 1: Imaging of bundles of elementary parallel rays to form a directions image in the back focal plane of a positive thin lens.
|}
 
This transformation can easily be deduced from two simples rules for the thin positive lens: 
* the rays through the center of the lens remain unchanged,
* the rays through the front focal point are transformed into parallel rays.

The object of measurement is usually located in the front [[focal plane]] of the [[lens (optics)|lens]]. In order to select a specific area of interest on the object (i.e., definition of a measuring spot, or field of measurement) an [[aperture]] can be placed on top of the object. In this configuration only rays from the measuring spot (aperture) hit the lens. 

The image of the [[aperture]] is projected to infinity while the image of the directional distribution of the light passing through the aperture (i. e. directions image) is generated in the back focal plane of the lens. When it is not considered appropriate to place an [[aperture]] into the front focal plane of the lens, i.e., on the object, the selection of the measuring spot (field of measurement) can also be achieved by using a second lens. An image of the object (located in the front focal plane of the first lens) is generated in the back focal plane of the second lens. The magnification, M, of this imaging is given by the ratio of the focal lengths of the lenses L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, M = f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

A third lens transforms the rays passing through the aperture (located in the plane of the image of the object) into a second directions image which may be analyzed by an image sensor (e.g., electronic camera).

The functional sequence is as follows:
* the first lens forms the directions image (transformation of directions into locations),
* the second lens together with the first projects an image of the object,
* the aperture allows selection of the area of interest (measuring spot) on the object,
* the third lens together with the second images the directions image on a 2-dimensional optical sensor (e.g., electronic camera).

This simple arrangement is the basis for all conoscopic devices (conoscopes). It is not straight forward however to design and manufacture lens systems that combine the following features:
* maximum angle of light incidence as high as possible (e.g., 80°),
* diameter of measuring spot up to several millimeters,
* achromatic performance for all angles of inclination,
* minimum effect of polarization of incident light.

Design and manufacturing of this type of complex lens system requires assistance by numerical modelling and a sophisticated manufacturing process.

Modern advanced conoscopic devices are used for rapid measurement and evaluation of the electro-optical properties of [[Liquid crystal display|LCD-screens]] (e.g., variation of [[luminance]], [[Display contrast|contrast]] and [[chromaticity]] with [[viewing cone|viewing direction]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18760">The '''Downrange Anti-missile Measurement Program''' or '''DAMP''' was an applied [[research]] [[project]] to obtain scientific data, just prior to and during re-entry, on intermediate- and intercontinental-range [[ballistic missiles]] as they returned to earth. The program was funded by the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA) under the technical direction of the Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC) during the period 1 January 1959 through 30 September 1963.

== Project organization ==
The downrange facility was a Liberty-class merchant vessel renovated and converted for its technical assignment. Its measurement equipment complex included C-band, L-band and UHF [[radars]]; digital and analog recorders; [[gyroscope]] stabilization; timing generators; mode switching; [[telemetry]] [[Data acquisition|acquisition]] apparatus; radiometers and riometers; [[Antenna boresight|boresight]] cine-TV and other [[photographic]] systems; [[Telecommunication|communication]]s and Transit Satellite navigation system.

As a complementary measurement facility to the DAMP ship, the [[Electromagnetic Research Laboratory]] at [[Moorestown, New Jersey|Moorestown]], [[New Jersey]], contained C- and L-band radar measurement equipment complete with [[Digital data|digital]] and [[analog signal|analog]] recording system in a range-support-tower combination for full-scale cross-section measurements under static conditions with [[orthogonal]] polarizations. Recorded analog data from this facility were provided for immediate use.

Data from both measurement facilities underwent necessary processing at the [[Riverton, New Jersey|Riverton]], New Jersey, data reduction center, a part of the [[Data Analysis]] Laboratory.

Foremost among DAMP Program objectives were to:

* Support AMM system designs.
* Support penetration aids program.
* Support AICBM weapon-system evaluation
* Provide scientific information on space environments and [[hypersonic]] flight
* Advance the general fund of knowledge on re-entry [[physics]] and dynamics and the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[phenomena]] association with re-entry.
* Develop new data acquisition and processing techniques for expanded data quality.

== USAS ''American Mariner'' ==
{{main|USAS American Mariner}}
[[File:American mariner ascension.jpg|thumb|300px|The DAMP Project ship, the USAS American Mariner at anchor Clarence Bay, Ascension Island, 1962]]
The DAMP ship, the USAS ''American Mariner'', was essentially a floating measurements [[laboratory]] that employed various types of [[sensors]], recording apparatus, and technical support equipment. It operated under conventional maritime regulations in the impact area of ballistic missile test firings, primarily in the [[Caribbean]] area and in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], near [[Ascension Island]]. During 1962, however, it operated in the [[Pacific Ocean]] in order to perform tracking duties during [[Operation Dominic]] [[atomic testing]].

The shipboard crew, provided by Mathiasen Tankers Corp., was complemented by approximately sixty technical personnel provided by [[RCA]] and Barnes Engineering Corporation, who operated and maintained the [[radar]] and support equipment. Each [[military operation|mission]] required a minimum of 36 hours of on-station preparation and pre- and post-flight [[calibration]]. Targets were those of opportunity fired on missile ranges as part of the overall [[External ballistics|ballistic]] [[missile]] test program, which at the time was in its infancy.

The DAMP ship participated in numerous missile test operations on the [[Atlantic Missile Range]], as well as on the [[Pacific Missile Range Facility|Pacific Missile Range]] during 1962 in support of the Operation Dominic atomic tests with emphasis on [[radio frequency]] and radar electromagnetic effects. In addition, the DAMP ship served in support of the [[Ranger Program]] on the Atlantic Missile Range for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]). Activities included [[vehicle tracking system|vehicle tracking]] during and subsequent to final burnout to supply designation data for the Deep Space [[Instrumentation]] Facility.

During its operation in the Atlantic Missile Range, the DAMP ship stopped at various ports for [[logistical]] support and requirements. Such ports included [[Recife]], [[Brazil]]; [[Antigua]], [[West Indies]]; [[Cape Town]], and [[Monrovia]] and [[Senegal]] in [[Africa]]. While on the Pacific Missile Range, the DAMP ship was based out of Honolulu, Hawaii, and operated in the [[Johnston Island]] area.

== Electromagnetic Research Laboratory ==
The Electromagnetic Research Laboratory (ERL) was located near the Missile and Surface [[Radar]] Division plant of RCA in [[Moorestown, New Jersey|Moorestown]], [[New Jersey]]. The C-band, low-power, cross-section-measurement system in conjunction with two static range configurations was used for full-scale targets weighing up to 4,000 pounds rotated through 360 degrees. Since measurements must be made on targets as if they were located in free space, returns from other than the target were reduced to 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; m², the general background level of one tower-terrain combination. The low-power radar was capable of transmitting any linear, circular, or elliptical polarization at C-band frequencies. It could receive the horizontal and vertical components of backscattered energy simultaneously. Cross-section data was recorded in analog form on Sanborn and Scientific Atlanta strip-[[chart recorder]]s and on Ampex magnetic tape. Digital cross sections were also recorded on a specially-designed CEC [[magnetic]] [[tape recorder]].

Other important functions of the ERL were the training of technical personnel, development and checkout of new equipment and techniques, and [[satellite watching|satellite tracking]] using a modified FPQ-4 radar. L-band measurement capability, similar to the C-band equipment, was introduced in late 1963.

== Data Analysis Laboratory ==
The Data Analysis Laboratory (DAL) was, in general, devoted to preparation of DAMP [[data]] for dissemination to the many users. These data are submitted to many forms that require numerous reduction processes. Thus, the DAL was divided into three basic operational areas, namely: (1) the Data Reduction Center in Riverton, New Jersey, (2) the Data Interpretation Group in Moorestown, New Jersey, and (3) the Plasma Analysis Group in Moorestown, New Jersey.

Raw data from the DAMP ship's [[sensors]] was delivered to the data reduction center for reduction, smoothing, and conversion to forms appropriate to interpretation. Equipment used in this data processing cycle included a digital tape [[translator (computing)|translator]], an IBM 709 [[computer]], an [[analog computer]], various tape and card converters and card punches, analog and digital playback equipment, data plotters, chart and film readers, [[oscilloscope]] [[cameras]] and oscilloscopes, a photo [[darkroom]], and miscellaneous support equipment.

The processed data would be disseminated directly or would be submitted to the Data Interpretation Group for study, interpretation, correlation, and comparison with theory. The data interpretation group was concerned with annotating basic data with interpretative comments to aid the ultimate data user. Objectives were to investigate every avenue for enhanced data output and maximum data accuracy and usefulness. Theoretical studies and experiments were made to augment the data comparisons and evaluations; such studies embraced the computational areas of numerical, mathematical, and [[statistical analysis]], analog and digital [[simulation]], and [[computer programming]] as well as the many physical sciences associated with missile flight and atmospheric re-entry.

One of the most important facets of re-entry physics is the interaction of plasmas and ionized wakes with [[electromagnetic waves]]. Work was being conducted in both the [[theoretical]] and practical nature of plasma physics as related to [[radar]] and associated [[phenomena]]; the following subcontract organization and consultants were active in support of phases of this research:

# RCA Victor, Ltd. Research Laboratories, Montreal, Canada.
# Keller and Lewis, New York University under the technical cognizance of Plasma and Space Applied Physics, [[RCA]], [[Princeton, New Jersey]].
# General Applied Science Laboratories, Inc., [[Westbury, New York]].

To evaluate the effects of plasma and wake on EM [[Wave propagation|propagation]], flow field studies were performed to generate plasma density contours. These theoretical results were used for comparison with measured data for analysis. Laboratory experiments and simulation studies were conducted to investigate complex phenomena such as turbulence in the plasma flow field.

== DAMP ship characteristics ==
The DAMP ship, the USAS (''United States [[Army]] Ship'') American Mariner was the primary data collection facility of the DAMP Project. Pertinent ship's characteristics include:

* Overall length - {{convert|441|ft|m|0}}.
* [[Beam (nautical)|Beam]] - {{convert|56|ft|m|0}}.
* Displacement (full load) - 10,650 tons.
* Speed - 8-10 knots.
* Fuel oil capacity - 9,507 barrels.
* Fresh water capacity - Tanks - 296,556 gallons - Evaporators - 19,750 gallons/day.
* Accommodations - Technical personnel - up to 91.
* Accommodations - Crew - Officers - 12 - Other - 55.
* Normal endurance (port-to-port) - 45 days.

== DAMP ship instrumentation ==
The DAMP ship was instrumented with various systems designed to locate and track incoming [[ballistic missiles]] in the predicted impact area, as well as instrumentation to record [[raw data]].

===Radar===
One of the two AN/FPQ-4 [[radars]] aboard the DAMP ship permitted the tracking of beacon-carrying targets to an unambiguous range of {{convert|1000|nmi|km|-3}}. The L-band and UHF radars, which shared a common antenna, permitted observation of the target by illumination to supplement the C-band. The AN/FPS-12 radar permitted [[surveillance]] of the general vicinity of the DAMP ship as well as vectoring of aircraft which may be assigned to the ship.

The [[telemetry]] acquisition system was a passive [[Data acquisition|acquisition]] aid operated on the interfereometer principle which gives angular position of the target relative to the ship. It was not a direct source of range information. [[Telemetry]] [[data]] was recorded on [[Magnetic tape]] at 7.5, 15, 30 and 60 ips from Nems Clark 1432 receiver.

The acquisition director, which comprised the RADAP-C [[Computer]] together with associated input and output devices, served as an acquisition aid, as means for checkout and calibration of associated [[electronic equipment]], and, in the TRANSIT mode, as an aid to the [[navigation]] of the DAMP ship.


The Transit system of [[navigation]] consisted of the Transit [[satellite]], a worldwide network of tracking stations to observe and determine the orbital elements of the satellite, and suitable receivers and Autonetics Recomp computers aboard the navigating vessel to receive the stable frequency [[radio]] signals broadcast by the satellite, to observe the [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] frequency shift, and from this information, plus the approximate location of the vessel, compute to within one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) the exact location of the vessel.

The quartz Reference [[Oscillator]] was the heart of the shipboard system, and operated at 1&amp;nbsp;MHz and 100 KC with a short term stability of 5 parts in 10 to the tenth averaged over a one-second interval, and a long term stability of 5 parts in 10 to the tenth per day.

=== Data recording ===
The Video [[Integrator]] accepted the radar [[video]] signal returns from a pulsed, range-gated radar system (AN/FPQ-4) and improved the signal-to-noise ratio of the radar video, thereby extending the acquisition range of the radar system. The video is continuously integrated and the output is in realtime.

In order to utilize fully the data gathering capabilities of the DAMP ship, it was necessary that the data gathered be stored in a form which permitted easy retrieval at the [[data analysis]] facility. Therefore, all data obtained at the DAMP ship was stored only on certified and designated CEC digital recorders, [[Ampex]] recorders, a [[Sanborn Recording Systems|Sanborn]] recorder, an [[RCA]] video recorder and a Mincom recorder. Timing was provided by two [[Hermes]] Hycon Eastern timing generators, one primary and one back-up. Timing signal outputs were 24-bit pulse absence code, 17-bit pulse absence code, and 13-bit pulse width code. Both generators were synchronized with Bureau of Standards, [[WWV (radio station)|WWV]], [[time standard]].

Raw test data recorded included time, sync and control, tracker 1 and 2 radar data, L-band and UHF [[radar]] data, gyro and server data, telemetry, voice, video and any other data designated by the test director.

One of the two Mk 51 Mod 3 gun directors, suitably modified and fitted with M-7 elbow [[telescopes]] (8-power, 6” field) was employed to furnish designation information to the AN/FPQ-4 tracking radars in “optical” mode. These directors had an [[azimuth]] travel of plus/minus 370 degrees and elevated from -20 degrees to +90 degrees. Azimuth and elevation data output was furnished at 1- and 36-speed from two (size 23) 400-cycle synchros. Maximum position error was 0.5 mil.

=== Communications equipment ===
[[Telecommunication|Communication]]s aboard the DAMP ship served several purposes: to communicate with administrative offices in New Jersey, to receive, immediately after launch, predicted impact data from the launch agency firing the [[External ballistics|ballistic]] or intercontinental missile, and, after completion of impact tracking, to report “quicklook” data back to the ERL in [[New Jersey]] so that it could be evaluated and a summary report be forwarded on to the project sponsor, ARPA.

During this period of operation, communications via [[satellite]] did not yet exist. As a result, communications between the DAMP ship and New Jersey was through the use of single-sideband (SSB) [[radio]], generally through the use of a 10&amp;nbsp;kW [[transmitter]]. The DAMP ship generally transmitted upper sideband (USB) voice and/or lower sideband (LSB) [[frequency-shift keying]] [[radioteletype]] in the area of 16 and 22&amp;nbsp;MHz when atmospheric conditions were favorable. When communications became difficult because of atmospheric conditions, the DAMP ship shifted to carrier wave (CW) transmission using standard [[Morse Code]]. In addition, because the ship could be out to sea for extended periods, such as a month or so, the DAMP [[ship]] carried an [[amateur radio]] room and equipment, which technical personnel could use to communicate with their families back home in the States via [[short wave radio]].

For local area communicating – for example when in the [[Ascension Island]] area in the Atlantic or the Johnston Island area in the [[Pacific]]) the DAMP vessel had the capability of transmitting and receiving USB voice and LSB radioteletype to/from such island locations. The DAMP ship could also communicate with [[aircraft]] and nearby islands using various VHF or UHF radio configurations.

Various antenna were employed to obtain maximum range from ship-to-shore. The UHF transceiver used a discone, while the VHF transceivers used ground plane antennas. The 1&amp;nbsp;kW HF transmitter used a remotely tuned {{convert|35|ft|m|0|adj=on}} whip [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], while the 3&amp;nbsp;kW HF transmitter used a vertical cage antenna., and the 10&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter employed a discone antenna. The vessel contained numerous state-of-the-art receivers, which were fed from an antenna distribution system from three {{convert|18|ft|m|0|adj=on}} whips.

The DAMP ship also carried advanced [[cryptographic]] equipment which could be used to encode or decode messages of a [[confidential]] or [[secret]] nature. Details of such equipment is classified and not described here.

As required by law, the ship’s [[Merchant Marine]] Master had a radio room and a radio operator who was responsible for ship’s business but was not associated in any way with the operation of the radio system used for technical purposes.

== Tracking Pedestals ==
Four modified TALOS AN/FPW-2 Guidance Pedestals were slaved to either or both of the AN/FPQ-4 tracking [[radars]] in order to provide optical, [[infra-red]] and other supplementary instrumentation for the observation of re-entry bodies.

== Mission Completion ==
On September 30, 1963 the U.S. Army Advanced Research Projects Agency DAMP mission and contract expired, and the [[U.S. Air Force]] assumed operational control of the [[USAS American Mariner]]. On January 1, 1964, it became an integral, but temporary, part of the U.S. Air Force's [[Eastern Test Range]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and was placed under the control of the [[Missile Test Project]] (MTP) based out of [[Patrick Air Force Base]], [[Florida]]. (See [[Eastern Test Range]] for details.) Eventually, the ship was removed from missile tracking service and sunk in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] while being used as a target by U.S. Navy pilots from the [[Patuxent River Naval Air Station]].

'''Design science''' is an outcome based [[information technology]] research methodology, which offers specific [[guidelines]] for [[evaluation]] and [[iteration]] within research projects.

Design science research focuses on the development and performance of (designed) [[Design science research#Design science artefacts|artifact]]s with the explicit intention of improving the functional performance of the artifact. Design science research is typically applied to categories of artifacts including [[algorithm]]s, [[human-computer interaction|human/computer interfaces]], design methodologies (including [[process model]]s) and languages. Its application is most notable in the [[Engineering]] and [[Computer Science]] disciplines, though is not restricted to these and can be found in many disciplines and fields.&lt;ref name=vaishnavi2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=kuechler&gt;{{cite journal

| volume     =  2008;17(5):
| pages      = 489–504
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In '''design science research''', as opposed to explanatory science research, academic research objectives are of a more pragmatic nature. Research in these disciplines can be seen as a quest for understanding and improving [[Human Performance|human performance]].&lt;ref name=vanaken&gt;{{cite journal
| author     = Van Aken JE
| title      = Management research as a design science: Articulating the research products of mode 2 knowledge production in management
| journal    = Br J Manage
| volume     =  2005;16(1)
| pages      = 19–36
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such renowned research institutions as [[MIT Media Lab|MIT’s Media Lab]], [[Stanford University|Stanford's]] Centre for Design Research, [[Carnegie-Mellon University|Carnegie-Mellon's]] Software Engineering Institute, [[Xerox|Xerox’s]] PARC and Brunel’s Organization and System Design Centre use the Design Science Research approach.&lt;ref name=vaishnavi2004/&gt; 

==Objectives==
According to Van Aken, the main goal of design science research is to develop [[knowledge]] that the professionals of the discipline in question can use to design solutions for their field problems. This mission can be compared to the one of the ‘explanatory sciences’, like the natural sciences and sociology, which is to develop knowledge to describe, explain and predict.&lt;ref name=vanaken /&gt; Hevner states that the main purpose of design science research is achieving knowledge and understanding of a problem domain by building and application of a designed artifact.&lt;ref name=hevner2004/&gt;

==Evolution==
Since the first days of [[computer science]], computer scientists have been doing design science research without naming it. They have developed new architectures for computers, new programming languages, new compilers, new algorithms, new data and file structures, new data models, new database management systems, and so on.  Much of the early research was focused on systems development approaches and methods. The dominant research philosophy has been to develop cumulative, theory-based research to be able to make prescriptions. It seems that this ‘theory-with-practical-implications’ research strategy has seriously failed to produce results that are of real interest in practice. This failure led to search practical research methods such as design science research.&lt;ref name=iivari&gt;{{cite journal

| title     = A paradigmatic analysis of information systems as a design science
| journal   = Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems
| volume    = 2007;19(2)
| page      = 39
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The design process is a sequence of expert activities that produces an [[Innovative Products of America|innovative product]].&lt;ref name=watts&gt;{{cite journal
| author     = Watts S

| volume     =  2009;48(1)
| pages      = 202–211
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artifact enables the researcher to get a better grasp of the problem; the re-evaluation of the problem improves the quality of the design process and so on. This build-and-evaluate loop is typically iterated a number of times before the final design artifact is generated.&lt;ref name=markus&gt;{{cite journal
| author     = Markus ML
| author2     = Majchrzak A

| title      = A design theory for systems that support emergent knowledge processes
| journal    = Mis Quarterly
| volume     =  2002
| pages      = 179–212
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In design science research, the focus is on the so-called field-tested and grounded technological rule as a possible product of Mode 2 research with the potential to improve the relevance of academic research in management. Mode 1 knowledge production is purely academic and mono-disciplinary, while Mode 2 is multidisciplinary and aims at solving complex and relevant field problems.&lt;ref name=vanaken /&gt;

==Guidelines in information systems research==

Hevner et al. have presented a set of guidelines for design science research within the discipline of [[Information systems (discipline)|Information Systems]].&lt;ref name=hevner2004/&gt; Design science research requires the creation of an innovative, purposeful artifact for a special [[problem domain]]. The artifact must be evaluated in order to ensure its [[utility]] for the specified problem. In order to form a novel research contribution, the artifact must either solve a problem that has not yet been solved, or provide a more effective solution. Both the construction and evaluation of the artifact must be done rigorously, and the results of the research presented effectively both to technology-oriented and [[management]]-oriented audiences.

Hevner counts 7 guidelines for a design science research:&lt;ref name=hevner2004 /&gt;
# '''Design as an artifact:''' Design-science research must produce a viable artifact in the form of a construct, a model, a method, or an instantiation.
# '''Problem relevance:''' The objective of design-science research is to develop technology-based solutions to important and relevant business problems.
# '''Design evaluation:''' The utility, quality, and efficacy of a design artifact must be rigorously demonstrated via well-executed evaluation methods.
# '''Research contributions:''' Effective design-science research must provide clear and verifiable contributions in the areas of the design artifact, design foundations, and/or design methodologies.
# '''Research rigor:''' Design-science research relies upon the application of rigorous methods in both the construction and evaluation of the design artifact.
# '''Design as a search process:''' The search for an effective artifact requires utilizing available means to reach desired ends while satisfying laws in the problem environment.
# '''Communication of research:''' Design-science research must be presented effectively both to technology-oriented as well as management-oriented audiences.

==Artifacts==
Artifacts within DSR are perceived to be knowledge containing. This knowledge ranges from the design logic, construction methods and tool to assumptions about the context in which the artifact is intended to function (Gregor, 2002).

The creation and evaluation of artifacts thus forms an important part in the DSR process which was described by Hevner et al., (2004) and supported by March and Storey (2008) as revolving around “build and evaluate”.

DSR artifacts can broadly include: models, methods, constructs, instantiations and design theories (March &amp; Smith, 1995; Gregor 2002; March &amp; Storey, 2008, Gregor and Hevner 2013), social innovations, new or previously unknown properties of technical/social/informational resources (March, Storey, 2008), new explanatory theories, new design and developments models and implementation processes or methods (Ellis &amp; Levy 2010).

==A three-cycle view==
Design science research can be seen as an embodiment of three closely related cycles of activities.&lt;ref name=hevner2&gt;{{cite journal
| author    = Hevner AR
| title     = The three cycle view of design science research
| journal   = Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems
| volume    =  2007;19(2)
| page      = 87
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevance cycle initiates design science research with an application context that not only provides the requirements for the research as inputs but also defines acceptance criteria for the ultimate evaluation of the research results.  The rigor cycle provides past knowledge to the research project to ensure its innovation. It is incumbent upon the researchers to thoroughly research and reference the knowledge base in order to guarantee that the designs produced are research contributions and not routine designs based upon the application of well-known processes.  The central [[design cycle]] iterates between the core activities of building and evaluating the design artifacts and processes of the research.

==Ethical issues==
Design science research in itself implies an ethical change from describing and explaining of the existing world to shaping it. One can question the values of IS research, i.e. whose values and what values dominate it, emphasizing that research may openly or latently serve the interests of particular dominant groups. The interests served may be those of the host organization as perceived by its top management, those of IS users, those of IS professionals or potentially those of other stakeholder groups in society.&lt;ref name=iivari /&gt;

'''''Field Notes from a Catastrophe: Man, Nature, and Climate Change''''' is a [[2006 in literature|2006]] [[non-fiction]] book by [[Elizabeth Kolbert]]. The book attempts to bring attention to the causes and effects of global [[climate change]]. Kolbert travels around the world where climate change is affecting the environment in significant ways. These locations include Alaska, Greenland, the Netherlands, and Iceland.  The environmental effects that are apparent consist of rising sea levels, thawing permafrost, diminishing ice shelves, changes in migratory patterns, and increasingly devastating forest fires due to loss of precipitation. She also speaks with many leading scientists about their individual research and findings. Kolbert brings to attention the attempts of large corporations such as [[Exxon Mobil]] and [[General Motors]] to influence politicians and discredit scientists. She also writes about America’s reluctance in the global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Leading this resistance, she explained, was the Bush administration, which was opposed to the [[Kyoto Protocol]] since it was ratified in 2005. Kolbert concludes the book by examining the events surrounding the events of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005 and arguing that governments have the knowledge and technologies to prepare for such disasters but choose to ignore the signs until it is too late.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/books/16gosn.html|title = In Epoch of Man, Earth Takes a Beating|last = Gosnell|first = Mariana|date = 2006-03-16|work = |access-date = 2015-03-21|newspaper = New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frugal innovation''' or '''frugal engineering''' is the process of reducing the complexity and cost of a good and its production. Usually this refers to removing nonessential features from a [[durable good]], such as a car or phone, in order to sell it in [[developing country|developing countries]]. Designing products for such countries may also call for an increase in durability&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/cb8074b0-80ef-11e0-8351-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1yOsysypm | title=Supply chain: ‘Frugal engineering’ heads push into manufacturing | work=Financial Times | date=May 19, 2011 | agency=The Financial Times Ltd | accessdate=June 21, 2012 | author=Fontanella-Khan, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, when selling the products, reliance on unconventional [[distribution (business)|distribution]] channels.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; When trying to sell to so-called "[[Bottom of the pyramid|overlooked consumers]]", firms hope volume will offset razor-thin [[profit margin]]s.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web | title=Indian Firms Shift Focus to the Poor | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=Oct 20, 2009 | accessdate=June 25, 2012 | author=Bellman, Eric | pages=A.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization&lt;ref name="Bhatti"&gt;Bhatti, Yasser Ahmad, Khilji, Shaista E and Basu, Radha. 2013.

Oxford, UK: Chandos Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and rising incomes in developing countries may also drive frugal innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.livemint.com/2011/05/12214736/Emerging-economies-outsidein.html | title=Emerging economies: outside-in and inside-out | work=livemint.com | date=May 13, 2011 | agency=HT Media | accessdate=June 24, 2012 | author=Shibulal, SD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such services and products need not be of inferior quality but must be provided cheaply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frugal-innovation.com/research-summary/ | title=About Frugal Innovation Research | work=Frugal Innovation Portal | date=March 19, 2012 | agency=Said Business School, University of Oxford | accessdate=Nov 19, 2012 | author=Bhatti, Yasser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012 ''[[The Financial Times]]'' newspaper called the concept "increasingly fashionable".&lt;ref&gt;Crabtree, James. "More with less." ''FT.com''. May 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several US universities have programs that develop frugal solutions. Such efforts include the Frugal Innovation Lab at [[Santa Clara University]] and a two quarter project course at [[Stanford University]], the Entrepreneurial Design for Extreme Affordability program.&lt;ref&gt;For Santa Clara University's lab, see {{cite web | url=http://www.scu.edu/socialbenefit/innovation/frugal/about.cfm | title=About Frugal Innovation | publisher=Santa Clara University | accessdate=June 20, 2012}}

==Variety of terms==
Many terms are used to refer to the concept. "Frugal engineering" was coined by [[Carlos Ghosn]], then joint chief of [[Renault]] and [[Nissan]], who stated, "frugal engineering is achieving more with fewer resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcxkkbyW7KMC&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;ots=r7z9uvasu9&amp;dq=Frugal%20engineering%20is%20achieving%20more%20with%20fewer%20resources.&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=India Inside | publisher=Harvard Business Press | author=Nirmalya Kumar, Phanish Puranam | year=2011 | pages=114 | isbn=9781422142400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the words "Gandhian"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theinstitute.ieee.org/career-and-education/career-guidance/introducing-gandhian-engineering573 | title=Introducing Gandhian Engineering | publisher=IEEE | work=The Institute | date=February 2010 | accessdate=June 20, 2012 | author=Platt, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "''jugaad''", [[Hindi]] for a stop-gap solution,&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/21551028 | title=Asian innovation | work=The Economist | date=Mar 24, 2012 | agency=The Economist Newspaper Limited | accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes used instead of "frugal". Other terms with allied meanings include "inclusive innovation", "catalytic innovation", "[[reverse innovation]]", and "[[Bottom of the pyramid|BOP]] innovation", etc.&lt;ref name=Market&gt;Bhatti, Yasser Ahmad and Ventresca, Marc. 2012. The Emerging Market for Frugal Innovation: Fad, Fashion, or Fit? (January 15, 2012) Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2005983&lt;/ref&gt;

At times this [[no frills]] approach can be a kind of [[disruptive innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/20/us-global-innovation-idUSBRE85J0G120120620 | title=Analysis: Healthcare sees emerging future in frugal innovation | work=reuters.com | date=Jun 20, 2012 &lt;!-- 9:05am EDT --&gt;  | agency=Thompson Reuters | accessdate=June 20, 2012 | author=Kelland, Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Spotlighted in a 2010 article in ''[[The Economist]]'',&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/15879359 | title=First break all the rules: The charms of frugal innovation | work=The Economist | date=Apr 15, 2010 | agency=The Economist Newspaper Ltd | accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the roots of this concept may lie in the [[appropriate technology]] movement of the 1950s&lt;ref name=Market/&gt; although profits may have been first wrung from underserved consumers in the 1980s when multinational companies like [[Unilever]] began selling single-use-sized toiletries in developing countries.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; Frugal innovation today isn't solely the domain of large, multinational corporations, however, as small, local firms have themselves chalked up a number of homegrown solutions.&lt;ref name=director&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.director.co.uk/ONLINE/2011/08_11_frugal-innovation.html | title=Plain and simple | work=Director Magazine | agency=Director Publications | accessdate=July 6, 2012 | author=Woodward, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[General Electric]] may win plaudits for its US$800 [[electrocardiography|EKG]] machines, cheap cell phones made by local, no-name companies,&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref name=director/&gt; and prosthetic legs fashioned from irrigation piping&lt;ref name=jleg/&gt; are also examples of frugal innovation.

The concept has gained popularity in the South Asian region,&lt;ref name=Bhatti/&gt; particularly in [[India]].&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, Rajnish and Herstatt, Cornelius (2012): "[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=17036170&amp;show=abstract Assessing India's lead market potential for cost-effective innovations]", Journal of Indian Business Research, Vol. 4 Iss: 2, pp.97 - 115&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of Commerce has singled out this nation for its innovative achievements saying in 2012, "there are many Indian firms that have learned to conduct R&amp;D in highly resource-constrained environments and who have found ways to use locally appropriate technology..."&lt;ref name="uscomm"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2012/03/28/us-commerce-secretary-john-bryson-visits-jaipur-foot | title=U.S. Commerce Secretary John Bryson Visits Jaipur Foot | work=US Department of Commerce | date=March 28, 2012 | accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable innovations==
[[File:Using Mobile Phone 0251.JPG|An Indian woman using her Nokia 1100|thumb]]

Frugal innovation is not limited to durable goods such as the [[General Electric|GE]] US$800 [[Electrocardiogram|EKG]] machine, Reliance Jio's [[Jio#JioPhone|JioPhone]] or the US$100 [[One Laptop Per Child]] but also services such as 1-cent-per-minute phone calls, mobile banking, off-grid electricity, and microfinance.&lt;ref name=Bhatti/&gt;

;ChotuKool fridge:
A tiny refrigerator sold by Indian company [[Godrej Group|Godrej]], the ChotuKool may have more in common with [[computer cooling]] systems than other refrigerators; it eschews the traditional compressor for a [[computer fan]].&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; (It may exploit the [[thermoelectric effect]].)

;Foldscope:
Designed to cost no more than a dollar, the [[Foldscope]] is a tough [[origami]] microscope assembled from a sheet of paper and a lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://makezine.com/2014/03/16/origami-microscope-for-just-50-cents/ | title=Origami Microscope for Just 50 Cents | publisher=Maker Media, Inc. | work=makezine.com | date=March 16, 2014 | accessdate=25 May 2014 | author=Roberts, Sandy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stanford]] engineer responsible more recently developed a string-and-cardboard contraption that can function similar to $1,000 centrifuges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://qz.com/935732/a-20-cent-lifesaving-tool-thats-made-with-only-paper-string-and-pvc-pipe/ | title=A 20-cent lifesaving tool that’s made with only paper, string, and PVC pipe | publisher=Atlantic Media | work=Quartz | date=March 19, 2017 | accessdate=30 March 201y | author=Yi, Hannah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Jaipur leg:
A low cost prosthetic developed in India, the [[Jaipur leg]] costs about $150 to manufacture and includes improvisations such as incorporating irrigation piping into the design to lower costs.&lt;ref name=jleg&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/08/world/la-fg-india-prosthesis-20120209 | title=India group's prosthetic device a boon for thousands of amputees | work=Los Angeles Times | date=February 8, 2012 | accessdate=June 24, 2012 | author=Magnier, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Mobile banking:
[[Mobile banking]] solutions in Africa, like [[Safaricom]]'s [[M-Pesa]], allow people access to basic banking services from their mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/06/06/qa-why-the-west-needs-jugaad-creativity/ | title=Q&amp;A: Why the West Needs ‘Jugaad’ Creativity | work=WSJ's Indiarealtime blog | date=June 6, 2012&lt;!--, 12:30 PM IST--&gt; | agency=Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc | accessdate=June 23, 2012 | author=Lahiri, Tripti}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money transfers done through mobiles are also much cheaper than using a traditional method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/14505519 | title=The power of mobile money | work=The Economist | date=Sep 24, 2009 | agency=The Economist Newspaper Limited | accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While basic banking can be done on a mobile alone, deposits and withdrawals of cash necessitate a trip to a local agent.&lt;ref&gt;For transferring money with only a mobile, see {{cite web | url=http://www.safaricom.co.ke/index.php?id=268 | title=Send (Transfer) Money | publisher=Safaricom | accessdate=June 23, 2012}}

;Nokia 1100:
Designed for developing countries, the [[Nokia 1100]] was basic, durable, and–besides a flashlight–had few features other than voice and text.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; Selling more than 200 million units only four years after its 2003 introduction&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news | url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/05/03/us-nokia-history-idUKL0262945620070503 | title=Nokia's cheap phone tops electronics chart | work=reuters.com | date=May 3, 2007 &lt;!-- 3:51pm BST --&gt;  | agency=Thompson Reuters | accessdate=June 20, 2012 | author=Virki, Tarmo}}&lt;/ref&gt; made it one of the best selling phones of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://gizmodo.com/5634258/the-most-popular-phone-in-the-world | title=The Most Popular Phone in the World | work=gizmodo.com | date=Oct 19, 2010 | agency=Gawker Media | accessdate=June 23, 2012 | author=Herrman, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sorghum beer:
In Africa, several companies including [[SABMiller]] and [[Diageo]], following in the footsteps of local home brewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.economist.com/node/21551092 | title=Beer in Africa: From lumps to lager; The race to slake a continent’s thirst | work=The Economist | date=Mar 24, 2012 | accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have made beer more affordable by using [[sorghum]] or [[cassava]] in place of malting barley and reducing packaging costs by using kegs instead of bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/13/sabmiller-africa-idUSL5E8EC4UZ20120313 | title=SABMiller strives to make beer affordable in Africa | publisher=Thompson Reuters | work=reuters.com | date=Mar 13, 2012 | accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Solar light bulb:
In some Philippine slums, solar skylights made from one liter soda bottles filled with water and bleach can provide light equivalent to that produced by a 55 watt bulb and may reduce electricity bills by US$10 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/28/144385288/in-philippine-slums-capturing-light-in-a-bottle | title=In Philippine Slums, Capturing Light In A Bottle | work=NPR | date=December 28, 2011 | accessdate=June 20, 2012 | author=ORENDAIN, SIMONE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerhard Friedrich Müller''' ([[Russian language|Russian:]] ''Фёдор Ива́нович Ми́ллер'', ''Fyodor Ivanovich Miller'', 29 October 1705 – 22 October 1783) was a historian and pioneer ethnologist.

==Biography==
Müller was born in [[Herford]], while he was educated at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]].  In 1725, he was invited to [[St. Petersburg]] to co-found the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]]. Müller participated in the [[Great Northern Expedition|second Kamchatka expedition]], which reported on life and nature of the further (eastern) side of the Ural mountain range. From 1733 till 1743, nineteen scientists and artists traveled through [[Siberia]] to study people, cultures and collected data for the creation of maps. Müller, who described and categorized clothing, religions and rituals of the Siberian ethnic groups, is considered to be the father of [[ethnography]].

On his return from Siberia, he became historiographer to the [[Russian Empire]].
He was one of the first historians to bring out a general account of Russian history based on an extensive examination of the documentary sources. His accentuation of the role of Scandinavians and Germans in the history of that country&amp;nbsp;– a germ of the so-called [[Normanist theory]]&amp;nbsp;– earned him enmity of [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], who had previously supported his work, and dented his Russian career.  In 1766, after many attacks by his colleagues, Müller was appointed keeper of the national archives. He drew up for the government a collection of its treatises.

In 1761, Müller was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].  He died, aged 77, in [[Moscow]].

A '''heat map''' (or '''heatmap''') is a graphical representation of data where the individual values contained in a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] are represented as colors. "Heat map" is a newer term but shading matrices have existed for over a century.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Leland|last2=Friendly|first2=Michael|title=The History of the Cluster Heat Map|journal=The American Statistician|date=May 2009|volume=63|issue=2|pages=179–184|doi=10.1198/tas.2009.0033|citeseerx=10.1.1.165.7924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Heat maps originated in 2D displays of the values in a data matrix. Larger values were represented by small dark gray or black squares (pixels) and smaller values by lighter squares. Loua (1873) used a shading matrix to visualize social statistics across the districts of [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson" /&gt; Sneath (1957) displayed the results of a [[cluster analysis]] by permuting the rows and the columns of a matrix to place similar values near each other according to the clustering. [[Jacques Bertin]] used a similar representation to display data that conformed to a [[Guttman scale]]. The idea for joining cluster trees to the rows and columns of the data matrix originated with Robert Ling in 1973. Ling used overstruck printer characters to represent different shades of gray, one character-width per pixel. [[Leland Wilkinson]] developed the first computer program in 1994 ([[SYSTAT (statistics)|SYSTAT]]) to produce cluster heat maps with high-resolution color graphics. The Eisen et al. display shown in the figure is a replication of the earlier SYSTAT design.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Software designer [[Cormac Kinney]] trademarked the term 'heat map' in 1991 to describe a 2D display depicting [[financial market]] information.&lt;ref name="USPTO_Heatmaps"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75263259&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch |title=United States Patent and Trademark Office, registration #75263259 |date=1993-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company that acquired Kinney's invention in 2003 unintentionally allowed the trademark to lapse.&lt;ref name="Silhavy"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=clIWDAAAQBAJ|title=Software Engineering Perspectives and Application in Intelligent Systems|author1=Silhavy|first1=Radek|last2=Senkerik|first2=Roman|last3=Oplatkova|first3=Zuzana Kominkova|last4=Silhavy|first4=Petr|last5=Prokopova|first5=Zdenka|date=2016-04-26|isbn=978-3-319-33622-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different kinds of heat maps:
* Web heat maps have been used for displaying areas of a Web page most frequently scanned by visitors. Web heat maps are often used alongside other forms of [[web analytics]] and [[session replay]] tools.
* Biology heat maps are typically used in [[molecular biology]] to represent the level of expression of many genes across a number of comparable samples (e.g. [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in different states, samples from different patients) as they are obtained from [[DNA microarrays]].
* The [[tree map]] is a 2D hierarchical partitioning of data that visually resembles a heat map.
* A [[mosaic plot]] is a tiled heat map for representing a two-way or higher-way table of data. As with treemaps, the rectangular regions in a mosaic plot are hierarchically organized. The means that the regions are rectangles instead of squares. Friendly (1994) surveys the history and usage of this graph.
* A density function visualization is a heat map for representing the density of dots in a map. It enables one to perceive density of points independently of the zoom factor. Perrot et al (2015) proposed a way to use density function to visualize billions and billions of dots using [[big data]] infrastructure with Spark and Hadoop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1109/LDAV.2015.7348077|last1=Perrot |first1=A.|last2=Bourqui |first2=R.|last3=Hanusse |first3=N.|last4=Lalanne |first4=F.|last5=Auber |first5=D|title=Large interactive visualization of density functions on big data infrastructure|journal=IEEE 5th Symposium on Large Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV), 2015 |pages=99–106|year=2015|language=english|isbn=978-1-4673-8517-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color schemes ==

There are many different [[color scheme]]s that can be used to illustrate the heat map, with perceptual advantages and disadvantages for each. Rainbow color maps are often used, as [[Color vision|humans can perceive]] more shades of color than they can of gray, and this would purportedly increase the amount of detail perceivable in the image.  However, this is discouraged by many in the scientific community, for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="borland2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/MCG.2007.323435|pmid=17388198|title=Rainbow Color Map (Still) Considered Harmful|journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|volume=27|issue=2|pages=14–7|year=2007|last1=Borland|first1=David|last2=Taylor |first2=Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/533/readings/pravda/truevis.htm How NOT to Lie with Visualization] – Bernice E.

* The colors lack the natural perceptual ordering found in [[grayscale]] or [[Black-body radiation#Spectrum|blackbody spectrum]] colormaps.&lt;ref name="borland2007" /&gt;
* Common colormaps (like the "jet" colormap used as the default in many visualization software packages) have uncontrolled changes in luminance that prevent meaningful conversion to grayscale for display or [[printing]]. This also distracts from the actual data, arbitrarily making yellow and cyan regions appear more prominent than the regions of the data that are actually most important.&lt;ref name="borland2007" /&gt;
* The changes between colors also lead to perception of gradients that aren't actually present, making actual gradients less prominent, meaning that rainbow colormaps can actually ''obscure'' detail in many cases rather than enhancing it.&lt;ref name="borland2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="borkin2011" /&gt;

== Choropleth maps vis-à-vis heat maps ==
[[Choropleth map]]s are sometimes incorrectly referred to as heat maps. A choropleth map features different shading or patterns within geographic boundaries to show the proportion of a variable of interest, whereas the coloration a heat map (in a map context) does not correspond to geographic boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gretchenpeterson.com/blog/archives/2694|title=Choropleth vs. Heat Map  –|website=www.gretchenpeterson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software implementations ==

Several heat map software implementations are freely available:
* [[R (programming language)|R]], a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, contains several functions to trace heat maps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Using R to draw a heat map from Microarray Data |work=Molecular Organisation and Assembly in Cells |date=26 Nov 2009 |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/currentstudents/peter_cock/r/heatmap/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/heatmap.html |title=Draw a Heat Map |work=R Manual }}&lt;/ref&gt;, including interactive cluster heat maps &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btx657|pmid=29069305

'''ICRANet''', the '''International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics Network''', is an [[international organization]] which promotes research activities in relativistic astrophysics and related areas. Its members are four countries and three Universities and Research Centers: the [[Armenia|Republic of Armenia]], the [[Brazil|Federative Republic of Brazil]], [[Italy|Italian Republic]], the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]], the [[University of Arizona]] (USA), [[Stanford University]] (USA) and [[International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics|ICRA]].

ICRANet headquarters are located in [[Pescara]], Italy.

== History of ICRANet foundation: ICRA and ICRANet ==

=== ICRA and ICRANet ===

In 1985, the International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICRA|url=http://www.icra.it/|website=ICRA|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223074040/http://www.icra.it/|archive-date=2008-02-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics|ICRA]] was founded by [[Remo Ruffini]] ([[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome "La Sapienza"]]) together with [[Riccardo Giacconi]] ([[Nobel Prize]] for Physics 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2002|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2002/summary/|publisher=[[Nobel Committee]]|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008225757/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2002/summary/|archive-date=2018-10-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Abdus Salam]] (Nobel Prize for Physics 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/summary/|publisher=[[Nobel Committee]]|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914132820/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/summary|archive-date=2018-09-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Paul Boynton ([[University of Washington]]), [[George Coyne]] (former director of the [[Vatican Observatory|Vatican observatory]]), [[Francis Everitt]] ([[Stanford University]]) and [[Fang Lizhi|Fang Li-Zhi]] ([[University of Science and Technology of China]]).

The Statute and the Agreement establishing of ICRANet were signed on March 19, 2003, and they were recognized in the same year by the [[Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] and the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]]. ICRANet has been created in 2005 by a law of the Italian Government, ratified by the Italian Parliament and signed by the President of the Italian Republic [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] on February 10, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEGGE 10 febbraio 2005, n. 31|url=http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/vediMenuHTML?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2005-03-05&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=005G0050&amp;tipoSerie=serie_generale&amp;tipoVigenza=originario|publisher=Gazzetta Ufficiale dell Repubblica Italiana|access-date=2015-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126185845/http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/vediMenuHTML?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2005-03-05&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=005G0050&amp;tipoSerie=serie_generale&amp;tipoVigenza=originario|archive-date=2015-11-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Republic of Armenia, [[Italy|Italian Republic]], the Vatican City State, ICRA, the [[University of Arizona]] and the [[Stanford University]] are the founding members.

On September 12, 2005, ICRANet Steering Committee was established and had its first meeting: Remo Ruffini and Fang Li-Zhi were appointed respectively Director and Chairman of the Steering Committee. On December 19, 2006 ICRANet Scientific Committee was established and had its first meeting in Washington DC. Riccardo Giacconi was appointed Chairman and John Mester Co-Chairman.

On September 21, 2005 the Director of ICRANet signed, together with the then Ambassador of Brazil in Rome Dante Coelho De Lima the adhesion of the [[Brazil|Federative Republic of Brazil]] to ICRANet. The entrance of Brazil, requested by the then President of Brazil [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Luiz Ignácio Lula Da Silva]] has been unanimously ratified by the Brazilian Parliament. On August 12, 2011, the then President of Brazil [[Dilma Rousseff]] signed the entrance of Brazil in ICRANet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DECRETO Nº 7.552, DE 12 DE AGOSTO DE 2011.|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2011-2014/2011/Decreto/D7552.htm|website=Presidência da República|publisher=Presidência da República|access-date=2015-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126173536/http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2011-2014/2011/Decreto/D7552.htm|archive-date=2015-11-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marcel Grossmann meetings ===

By the beginning of the twentieth century the new branch of mathematics, tensor calculus, was developed in the works of [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro|Gregorio Ricci Curbastro]] and [[Tullio Levi-Civita|Tullio Levi Civita]] of the [[University of Padua]] and the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome "La Sapienza"]]. [[Marcel Grossmann]] of the [[University of Zurich]] who had a deep knowledge of the Italian school of geometry and who was close to Einstein introduced to him these concepts. The collaboration between Einstein and Grossmann was [[History of general relativity|essential]] for the development of General Relativity.

Remo Ruffini and Abdus Salam in 1975 established the Marcel Grossmann meetings (MG) on Recent Developments in Theoretical and Experimental General Relativity, Gravitation, and Relativistic Field Theories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcel Grossmann Meetings|url=http://www.icranet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=258|website=icranet.org|publisher=ICRANet|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126165119/http://www.icranet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=258|archive-date=2015-11-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which take place every three years in different countries, gathering more then 1000 researchers. MG1 and MG2 were held in 1975 and in 1979 in [[Trieste]]; MG3 in 1982 in [[Shanghai]]; MG4 in 1985 in Rome; MG5 in 1988 in [[Perth]]; MG6 in 1991 in [[Kyoto]]; MG7 in 1994 at [[Stanford, California|Stanford]]; MG8 in 1997 in [[Jerusalem]]; MG9 in 2000 in Rome; MG10 in 2003 in [[Rio de Janeiro]]; MG11 in 2006 in [[Berlin]]; MG12 in 2009 in [[Paris]]; MG13 in 2012 in [[Stockholm]]; MG14 in 2015 and MG15 in 2018 both in Rome. Since its foundation, ICRANet has always played a leading role in the organization of those meetings.

=== Brazilian Science Data Center ===
The main objective of the Brazilian Science Data Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BSDC|url=http://bsdc.icranet.org/|publisher=ICRANet|accessdate=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208073146/http://bsdc.icranet.org/|archive-date=2015-12-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (BSDC) is to provide data of all international space missions existing on the wavelength of X- and gamma rays, and later on the whole electromagnetic spectrum, for all the galactic and extragalactic sources of the Universe. A special attention will be paid to the achievement and the complete respect of the levels defined by the [[International Virtual Observatory Alliance]] (IVOA). In addition to these specific objectives, BSDC will promote technical seminars, annual workshops and it will assure a plan of scientific divulgation and popularization of science with the aim of the understanding of the Universe.

The BSDC is currently being implemented at CBPF, and at the [[Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul]] (UFRGS), and will be expanded to all other ICRANet centers in Brazil as well as to the other Latin-American ICRANet Centers in [[Argentina]], [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]]: a unique coordinated continental research network planned for Latin America.

'''IMAGE''' ('''Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration''') is a [[NASA]] [[Medium Explorers program|Medium Explorers]] mission that studied the global response of the [[Earth]]'s [[magnetosphere]] to changes in the [[solar wind]]. It was believed lost but as of August 2018 might be recoverable. It was launched 25 March 2000 by a [[Delta II]] rocket from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base|Vandenberg AFB]] on a two-year mission. Almost six years later, it unexpectedly ceased operations in December 2005 during its extended mission and was declared lost.&lt;ref name="nssdc-master"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=2000-017A |title=IMAGE - Spacecraft Details |work=[[NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive]] |access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft was part of NASA's [[Sun-Earth Connections Program]], and during its run had over 400 research articles published in peer-reviewed journals using its data.&lt;ref name="nasa20060120"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/jan/HQ_06030_IMAGE_quits.html |title=NASA Magnetic Field Mission Ends |publisher=NASA |first1=Erica |last1=Hupp |first2=Nancy |last2=Neal |first3=Bill |last3=Steigerwald |date=20 January 2006 |id=06-030}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had special cameras that provided various breakthroughs in understanding the dynamics of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] around the Earth.

==Overview==
IMAGE was the first spacecraft dedicated to imaging the Earth's [[magnetosphere]].&lt;ref name="presskit" /&gt; IMAGE was a spacecraft developed by the [[Explorers program|Medium-Class Explorers]] (MIDEX) program, and it was the first spacecraft dedicated to observing the magnetosphere of the Earth, producing  comprehensive global [[Digital imaging|images]] of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the inner magnetosphere. The IMAGE craft was placed in a 1,000×46,000&amp;nbsp;km [[orbit]] around the Earth, with an [[inclination]] of 90° (passing over the [[geographical pole|pole]]s) and a 14.2 hour period.

By acquiring images every 2 minutes in wavelengths invisible to the human eye, it allowed detailed study of the interaction of the [[solar wind]] with the magnetosphere and the magnetosphere's response during a [[magnetic storm]]. From its distant orbit, the spacecraft produced a wealth of images of the previously invisible region of space in the inner magnetosphere, exceeded all its scientific goals. A senior review in 2005, just previous to its loss, described the mission as "extremely productive",&lt;ref name='Senior Review'&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/publication/document/sr_rev_2005/2005_image_senior_review.pdf |title=Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) |conference=Senior Review 2005. 5 October 2005. San Antonio, Texas. |first1=James L. |last1=Burch |first2=Thomas E. |last2=Moore |first3=James L. |last3=Green |first4=Stephen A. |last4=Fuselier |first5=Harald U. |last5=Frey |first6=Jerry |last6=Goldstein |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; having confirmed several theoretical predictions (e.g., [[plasmasphere]] plumes, pre-midnight ring-current injection, and continuous antiparallel reconnection), discovered numerous new and unanticipated phenomena (e.g., plasmasphere shoulders, subauroral proton arcs, and a secondary interstellar neutral atom stream), and answered a set of outstanding questions regarding the source region of kilometric continuum radiation, the role of solar wind pressure pulses in ionospheric outflow, and the relationship between proton and electron auroras during substorms.&lt;ref name='Senior Review'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluto.space.swri.edu/IMAGE/highlights.html |title=IMAGE Mission Highlights |publisher=Southwest Research Institute |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the spacecraft went silent in December 2005, it had already been approved a mission extension until 2010.&lt;ref name='Senior Review'/&gt;

Costs for IMAGE are estimated at {{US$|132 million}}, including the spacecraft, instruments, launch vehicle, and ground operations.&lt;ref name="presskit" /&gt;

==Payload==
Its science payload consists of three suites of [[Measuring instrument|instruments]]:&lt;ref name="presskit" /&gt;
* [[Energetic neutral atom]] imagers (LENA, MENA, HENA) — These instruments use hydrogen, helium, and oxygen atoms in the exosphere to form images and determine the properties of their low-, medium- and high-energy parent ions. HENA, the High Energy Neutral Atom imager is a modified version of the MIMI/INCA (Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument/Ion and Neutral Camera) sensor flown on the ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' mission.
* [[Ultraviolet astronomy|Ultraviolet imagers]] (FUV and EUV) — The Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) imager detects light from helium atoms in Earth's [[plasmasphere]]. The Far Ultraviolet (FUV) imager employs three detectors to image the [[aurora]]s in different wavelengths and measure the distribution of different ions.
* [[Astrophysical plasma|Radio Plasma]] Imager (RPI) — This instrument uses pulses of radio waves to image the entire volume of the Earth's magnetic field. With its 502 meters-long antenna, it sends out a burst of radio waves, which reflect off of clouds of charged particles between the plasmasphere's outer boundary all the way out to the boundary where the [[Earth's magnetic field]] is impacted by the [[solar wind]]. RPI also measures naturally occurring [[waves in plasmas|plasma waves]] at the spacecraft's location.

The Central Instrument Data Processor (CIDP) as well as the Command &amp; Data Handling Subsystem (main on-board computer) were built around the mission-proven [[IBM RAD6000]] [[avionics]] processors.&lt;ref name="presskit" /&gt;

==Loss==
On 18 December 2005, the satellite failed to make an expected contact at 16:20 UTC.  An earlier contact had ended successfully at 07:40 the same day with no sign of trouble.&lt;ref name=FRBpresent&gt;{{cite web |url=https://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/publication/document/IMAGE_FRB_Presentation_4-21-06.pdf |title=IMAGE Failure Review Board Final Presentation |publisher=NASA |first=Mike |last=Prior |date=21 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|14}}  Over the following days and weeks, commands were sent "blind" to reset the transmitter, change antennas, and otherwise attempt to re-establish contact with the spacecraft, but no signal (not even an unmodulated [[carrier wave]]) was received.  Recovery efforts included using different [[NASA Deep Space Network|DSN]] antennas, using non-NASA ground stations in case there was some systematic DSN error, transmitting no commands for several days to trigger a 72-hour [[watchdog timer]], increasing transmit power in case the antenna was badly misaligned, and optical and radar observations of the satellite to check for debris, change in spin rate or change in orbit indicative of a collision or other damage.{{r|FRBpresent|p=16–17}}

The spacecraft was also commanded to slightly increase its spin rate and asymmetrically turn on its heaters. If observed, these would indicate that it could receive commands but not transmit. Neither change was seen and analysis later indicated that the temperature change would have been undetectable.&lt;ref name=FRBreport&gt;{{cite web |url=https://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/publication/document/IMAGE_FRB_Final_Report.pdf |title=IMAGE Failure Review Board Final Report: Executive Summary |publisher=NASA |date=19 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|9–10}}  An attempt to observe the craft's temperature to determine if it was completely dead or consuming the power expected in [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]] was inconclusive.{{r|FRBreport|p=10–11}}

A careful failure analysis revealed that, among plausible causes for an abrupt bidirectional loss of communication, the [[Solid-state electronics|Solid State]] [[Electric power conversion|Power Converter]] (SSPC) for the transponder had, among its features, an "instant trip" shutdown in response to a high-current ({{val|100|ul=A}}) [[short circuit]].&lt;ref name=SaSS&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_yvbP5JMa0C&amp;pg=PA57 |title=Software and System Safety: Accidents, Incidents, and Lessons Learned |publisher=[[AuthorHouse]] |last=Hardy |first=Terry L. |page=57 |date=16 April 2012 |isbn=978-1-4685-7470-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critically, such a shutdown was ''not'' reported in the power supply's telemetry output and this lack was not documented. &lt;ref&gt;The non-reporting was by design, as in non-spacecraft applications it would be dangerous to automatically restore power in such an event, while in a spacecraft failure to receive means loss of mission so there is nothing more to lose by trying.&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was undocumented the spacecraft's hardware and software had no provision for attempting to reset the SSPC if it reported good status.&lt;ref name=SaSS/&gt;{{r|FRBreport|p=13}}  This would result in the observed symptoms: no radio communication with an apparently undamaged spacecraft.{{r|FRBreport|p=1,12–13,22,29–31}}

Although such a short circuit would be almost impossible without fatal damage to the spacecraft, the shutdown could be falsely triggered by a radiation-induced [[single event upset]].&lt;ref name=SaSS/&gt;{{r|FRBreport|p=1,30–31}}  It could be simply fixed by power-cycling the supply, but the spacecraft design left no way to send such a command, nor was one built in.

The same problem with the same model of power supply had affected the [[EO-1]] and [[WMAP]] satellites (launched after IMAGE),{{r|FRBreport|p=1,13}} but they were able to recover.

In January 2006, NASA declared the mission over, declaring that "Preliminary analysis indicated the craft's power supply subsystems failed, rendering it lifeless."&lt;ref name="nasa20060120" /&gt; Despite this, they continued to try and establish contact. In early 2006, NASA convened a board of experts to figure out what went wrong. After several months they created a report in which they theorized that IMAGE had tripped a power breaker and might fix itself.&lt;ref name="12years"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/01/31/nasa-lost-contact-with-a-satellite-12-years-ago-an-amateur-just-found-its-signal/ |title=NASA lost contact with a satellite 12 years ago. An amateur just found its signal. |work=[[The Washington Post]] |last1=Selk |first1=Avi |accessdate=1 February 2018 |date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was hoped that an [[eclipse]] when the spacecraft passed through the Earth's shadow in October 2007 would result in a sufficiently deep supply voltage sag that it would trigger a total bus reset, which would cause a power cycle of the suspect supply.{{r|FRBreport|p=14–18}}  However, attempts to contact the craft after this eclipse were not successful.{{r|alive}}

==Recovery efforts==
On 20 January 2018, IMAGE was found by Canadian radio amateur [[Satellite watching|and satellite tracker]] Scott Tilley to be broadcasting, and he reported it to NASA. He had been scanning the [[S-band]] (microwaves) in the hopes of finding the [[Zuma (satellite)|Zuma]] satellite.{{r|alive}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/01/amateur-astronomer-discovers-revived-nasa-satellite |title=Amateur astronomer discovers a revived NASA satellite |work=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |last1=Voosen |first1=Paul |date=26 January 2018 |accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2018, Richard Burley of NASA reported that they were trying to establish communication with the satellite using the [[NASA Deep Space Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://www.satobs.org/seesat/Jan-2018/0192.html |title=Re: NASA IMAGE - Returns from the Dead |mailing-list=SeeSat-L |last=Burley |first=Richard J. |via=Scott Tilley |date=24 January 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Burley reported that engineers at [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]  successfully acquired the signal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://www.satobs.org/seesat/Jan-2018/0203.html |title=Fwd: 20180126 Break-Break-Break IMAGE Status |mailing-list=SeeSat-L |last=Burley |first=Richard J. |via=Scott Tilley |date=26 January 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed on 30 January 2018 that IMAGE is the source.{{r|NASA IMAGE Updates}} It is not known when the satellite started broadcasting, but re-examination of old data recorded by Tilley and fellow satellite tracker Cees Bassa showed transmissions from the same satellite in October 2016 and May 2017.&lt;ref name=Bassa&gt;{{cite web |url=https://skyriddles.wordpress.com/2018/01/30/when-did-image-return-from-the-dead/ |title=When did IMAGE return from the dead? |work=Riddles in the Sky |first=Cees |last=Bassa |date=30 January 2018 |access-date=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bassa hypothesized that while the 2007 eclipse did not manage to reset the satellite, another one did the trick, probably sometime between 2014 and 2016.{{r|12years}}

On 8 February 2018, NASA published a detailed account of the IMAGE satellite's recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/a-detailed-timeline-of-the-image-mission-recovery |title=A Detailed Timeline of The IMAGE Mission Recovery |last=Blumberg |first=Sara |date=8 February 2018 |work=NASA |access-date=10 February 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite was transmitting data beyond simple telemetry, indicating that some of its six onboard instruments were still active.&lt;ref name='McKay'&gt;{{cite news |url=https://gizmodo.com/over-a-decade-later-nasas-long-dead-image-satellite-ma-1822479068 |title=Over a Decade Later, NASA's Long-Dead IMAGE Satellite May Have Come Back to Life |work=Gizmodo |first=Tom |last=McKay |date=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA engineers are attempting to determine the satellite's status,{{r|NASA IMAGE Updates}} but since the software and hardware type used in the IMAGE Mission Operations Center have been discarded and no longer exist, they are in the process of adapting old software and databases to their modern systems and track down replacement hardware.{{r|NASA IMAGE Updates}}&lt;ref name="space20180131"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/39534-amateur-astronomer-finds-lost-nasa-satellite.html |title=Signal Detected by Amateur Astronomer Came from Long-Lost Satellite, NASA Confirms |work=Space.com |first=Calla |last=Cofield |date=31 January 2018 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newatlas20180130"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://newatlas.com/nasa-image-satellite-recovery/53174/ |title=NASA to attempt recovery of lost IMAGE satellite |work=New Atlas |first=David |last=Szondy |date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February 2018, NASA again lost contact with the satellite, but not in the same manner it did in 2005. Richard Burley, former IMAGE mission director, stated that he believes there is an issue with IMAGE's spin axis in relation to its medium-gain antenna placement. If NASA can regain control of the spacecraft, and the status of data and ground systems can be assessed, it will decide if it can fund a mission restart.&lt;ref name="airspace201804"/&gt;

On 4 March 2018, the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University reported detecting the signal from the satellite, but it was too faint to lock onto.&lt;ref name="nasa-image-confirmed"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/nasa-image-confirmed |title=Latest Updates from NASA on IMAGE Recovery |publisher=NASA  |first=Miles |last=Hatfield |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 May 2018, Scott Tilley again detected a strong signal from IMAGE. Hours later NASA and APL engineers had locked onto the signal and were receiving telemetry. Commands were transmitted to IMAGE, but for unknown reasons the spacecraft only acknowledged receipt of a fraction of those commands.&lt;ref name="nasa-image-confirmed" /&gt;

On 28 August 2018 NASA announced that the IMAGE team had stopped receiving any signals from the satellite, as previously happened in spring,&lt;ref name="nasa-image-confirmed" /&gt; and would continue to try sending commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/satellites/a22877021/nasa-already-lost-the-satellite-it-just-found-in-january/ |title=NASA Already Lost the Satellite It Just Found in January |work=Popular Mechanics |last1=Thompson |first1=Avery |date=30 August 2018 |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angular size of patch in atmosphere over which electromagnetic waves in the same plane stay parallel.  The patch size inversely affects the [[Fried_parameter|Fried Parameter]] and the resolution of optical telescopes.  Adaptive [[optical telescope|optical telescopes]] uses a bright light source to identify the properties of the patch in the line of sight to the object of interest to correct for seeing effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1558">In [[crystal growth]], a '''Knudsen cell''' is an  [[effusion]]  [[evaporator]] source for relatively low partial pressure elementary sources (e.g. Ga, Al, Hg, As). Because it is easy to control the temperature of the evaporating material in Knudsen cells, they are commonly used in [[molecular-beam epitaxy]].

==Development==
The Knudsen effusion cell was developed by [[Martin Knudsen]] (1871-1949). A typical Knudsen cell contains a [[crucible]] (made of [[pyrolytic]] [[boron nitride]], [[quartz]], [[tungsten]] or [[graphite]]), heating filaments (often made of metal [[tantalum]]), [[water cooling]] system, [[heat shield]]s, and an [[:wikt:orifice|orifice]] shutter.

==Vapor pressure measurement==
The Knudsen cell is used to measure the [[vapor pressure]]s of a solid with very low vapor pressure. Such a solid forms a vapor at low pressure by [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. The vapor slowly effuses through the pinhole, and the loss of mass is proportional to the vapor pressure and can be used to determine this pressure.&lt;ref name=Atk&gt;[[Peter Atkins]] and Julio de Paula, ''Physical Chemistry'' (8th ed., W.H.Freeman 2006) p.756 {{ISBN|0-7167-8759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[heat of sublimation]] can also be determined by measuring the vapor pressure as a function of temperature, using the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]].&lt;ref&gt;Drago, R.S. ''Physical Methods in Chemistry'' (W.B.Saunders 1977) p.563 {{ISBN|0-7216-3184-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alignment tools==
After quality control, the first step of RNA-Seq analysis involves alignment ''[http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/docs/2012/05/RNA/_downloads/Alignment.pdf (RNA-Seq alignment) ]''  of the sequenced reads to a reference genome (if available) or to a transcriptome database. See also &lt;ref name=Nuno2012&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Bioinformatics |volume=28| year=2012 |author1=Nuno A. Fonseca |author2=Johan Rung |author3=Alvis Brazma |author4=John C.

===Short (unspliced) aligners===
Short aligners are able to align continuous reads (not containing gaps result of splicing) to a genome of reference. Basically, there are two types: 1) based on the [[Burrows-Wheeler transform]] method such as Bowtie and BWA, and 2) based on Seed-extend methods, [[Needleman-Wunsch]] or [[Smith-Waterman]] algorithms. The first group (Bowtie and BWA) is many times faster, however some tools of the second group tend to be more sensitive, generating more correctly aligned reads. See a comparative study of short aligners - ''[http://lh3lh3.users.sourceforge.net/alnROC.shtml comparative study]''.
&lt;!--For an online comparative study of short aligners performances see ''[http://massgenomics.org/short-read-aligners MassGenomics/aligners]''.--&gt;
*''' [[BFAST]]''' ''[http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/bfast/index.php?title=Main_Page BFAST]'' aligns short reads to reference sequences and presents particular sensitivity towards errors, SNPs, insertions and deletions. BFAST works with the [[Smith-Waterman]] algorithm. See also ''[http://seqanswers.com/wiki/BFAST seqanwers/BFAST]''.
*'''[[BowTie (aligner)|Bowtie]]''' ''[http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml Bowtie]'' is a fast short aligner using an algorithm based on the [[Burrows-Wheeler transform]] and the [[FM-index]]. Bowtie tolerates a small number of mismatches.
*'''Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)'''  ''[http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/ BWA]''. BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads.
*'''Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package (SOAP)''' ''[http://soap.genomics.org.cn/ SOAP]''.
*'''GNUMAP''' ''[http://dna.cs.byu.edu/gnumap/ GNUMAP]'' performs alignment using a probabilistic [[Needleman-Wunsch]] algorithm. This tool is able to handle alignment in repetitive regions of a genome without losing information. The output of the program was developed to make possible easy visualization using available software.
*'''Maq''' ''[http://maq.sourceforge.net/maq-man.shtml Maq]'' first aligns reads to reference sequences and after performs a consensus stage. On the first stage performs only ungapped alignment and tolerates up to 3 mismatches.
*'''Mosaik''' ''[http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/marthlab/Mosaik Mosaik]''. Mosaik is able to align reads containing short gaps using [[Smith-Waterman algorithm]], ideal to overcome SNPs, insertions and deletions.
*'''NovoAlign (commercial)''' ''[http://www.novocraft.com/main/index.php NovoAlign]'' is a short aligner to the Illumina platform based on [[Needleman-Wunsch]] algorithm.  It is able to deal with bisulphite data. Output in SAM format.
*'''PerM''' ''[https://code.google.com/p/perm/ PerM]'' is a software package which was designed to perform highly efficient genome scale alignments for hundreds of millions of short reads produced by the ABI SOLiD and Illumina sequencing platforms. PerM is capable of providing full sensitivity for alignments within 4 mismatches for 50bp SOLID reads and 9 mismatches for 100bp Illumina reads.
*'''RazerS''' ''[http://www.seqan.de/projects/razers RazerS]''.
*'''SEAL''' ''[http://biodoop-seal.sourceforge.net/ SEAL]'' uses a [[MapReduce]] model to produce distributed computing on clusters of computers. Seal uses BWA to perform alignment and [[Picard MarkDuplicates]] to detection and duplicate read removal.
*'''segemehl''' ''[http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/segemehl/ segemehl]''.
*'''SeqMap''' ''[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jianghui/seqmap/ SeqMap]''.
*'''SHRiMP''' ''[http://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/shrimp/ SHRiMP]'' employs two techniques to align short reads. Firstly, the [[q-gram]] filtering technique based on multiple seeds identifies candidate regions. Secondly, these regions are investigated in detail using [[Smith-Waterman]] algorithm.
*'''SMALT''' ''[http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/ Smalt]''.
*'''Stampy''' ''[http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/project-stampy Stampy]'' combines the sensitivity of hash tables and the speed of BWA. Stampy is prepared to alignment of reads containing sequence variation like insertions and deletions. It is able to deal with reads up to 4500 bases and presents the output in SAM format.
*'''ZOOM (commercial)''' ''[http://www.bioinfor.com/zoom/general/overview.html ZOOM]'' is a short aligner of the Illumina/Solexa 1G platform. ZOOM uses extended spaced seeds methodology building hash tables for the reads, and tolerates mismatches and insertions and deletions.
*'''WHAM''' ''[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/wham/ Wham]''. WHAM is a high-throughput sequence alignment tool developed at University of Wisconsin-Madison. It aligns short DNA sequences (reads) to the whole human genome at a rate of over 1500 million 60bit/s reads per hour, which is one to two orders of magnitudes faster than the leading state-of-the-art techniques.

===Spliced aligners===
Many reads span exon-exon junctions and can not be aligned directly by Short aligners, thus specific aligners were necessary - Spliced aligners. Some Spliced aligners employ Short aligners to align firstly unspliced/continuous reads (exon-first approach), and after follow a different strategy to align the rest containing spliced regions - normally the reads are split into smaller segments and mapped independently.

====Aligners based on known splice junctions (annotation-guided aligners)====
In this case the detection of splice junctions is based on data available in databases about known junctions. This type of tools cannot identify new splice junctions. Some of this data comes from other expression methods like [[expressed sequence tags]] (EST).

Provides the possibility of quality control and trimming of reads. The genome alignments are performed using '''mapreads''' and the splice junctions are identified based on a library of known exon-junction sequences. This tool allows visualization of alignments and tag counting.
*'''RUM''' ''[https://github.com/PGFI/rum/wiki RUM]'' performs alignment based on a pipeline, being able to manipulate reads with splice junctions, using Bowtie and Blat. The flowchart starts doing alignment against a genome and a transcriptome database executed by Bowtie. The next step is to perform alignment of unmapped sequences to the genome of reference using BLAT. In the final step all alignments are merged to get the final alignment. The input files can be in FASTA or FASTQ format. The output is presented in RUM and SAM format.

====De novo splice aligners====
De novo Splice aligners allow the detection of new Splice junctions without need to previous annotated information (some of these tools present annotation as a suplementar option). See also [http://openwetware.org/wiki/Wikiomics:RNA-Seq De novo Splice Aligners].

* '''ABMapper''' ''[http://hkbic.cuhk.edu.hk/software/abmapper ABMapper]''.
*'''BBMap''' ''[http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/ BBMap]'' Uses short kmers to align reads directly to the genome (spanning introns to find novel isoforms) or transcriptome.  Highly tolerant of substitution errors and indels, and very fast.  Supports output of all SAM tags needed by Cufflinks.  No limit to genome size or number of splices per read.  Supports Illumina, 454, Sanger, Ion Torrent, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore reads, paired or single-ended.  Does not use any splice-site-finding heuristics optimized for a single taxonomic branch, but rather finds optimally-scoring multi-affine-transform global alignments, and thus is ideal for studying new organisms with no annotation and unknown splice motifs.  Open-source, written in pure Java; supports all platforms with no recompilation and no other dependencies.
*'''ContextMap''' ''[http://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/softwareservices/contextmap ContextMap]'' was developed to overcome some limitations of other mapping approaches, such as resolution of ambiguities. The central idea of this tool is to consider reads in gene expression context, improving this way alignment accuracy. ContextMap can be used as a stand-alone program and supported by mappers producing a SAM file in the output (e.g.: TopHat or MapSplice). In stand-alone mode aligns reads to a genome, to a transcriptome database or both.
*'''CRAC''' ''[http://crac.gforge.inria.fr/ CRAC]'' propose a novel way of analyzing reads that integrates genomic locations and local coverage, and detect candidate mutations, indels, splice or fusion junctions in each single read. Importantly, CRAC improves its predictive performance when supplied with e.g. 200 nt reads and should fit future needs of read analyses.

*'''HISAT''' ''[http://www.ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat/index.shtml HISAT]''. HISAT is a fast and sensitive spliced alignment program for mapping RNA-seq reads. In addition to one global FM index that represents a whole genome, HISAT uses a large set of small FM indexes that collectively cover the whole genome (each index represents a genomic region of ~64,000 bp and ~48,000 indexes are needed to cover the human genome). These small indexes (called local indexes) combined with several alignment strategies enable effective alignment of RNA-seq reads, in particular, reads spanning multiple exons. The memory footprint of HISAT is relatively low (~4.3GB for the human genome). We have developed HISAT based on the Bowtie2 implementation to handle most of the operations on the FM index.
*'''HMMSplicer''' ''[http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/index.php?software=105 HMMSplicer]'' can identify canonical and non-canonical splice junctions in short-reads. Firstly, unspliced reads are removed with Bowtie. After that, the remaining reads are one at a time divided in half, then each part is seeded against a genome and the exon borders are determined based on the [[Hidden Markov Model]] . A quality score is assigned to each junction, useful to detect false positive rates.

It uses the seed-and-vote mapping paradigm to determine the mapping location of the read by using its largest mappable region. It automatically decides whether the read should be globally mapped or locally mapped. For RNA-seq data, Subread should be used for the purpose of expression analysis. Subread is very powerful in mapping gDNA-seq reads as well.
* '''Subjunc''' ''[http://subread.sourceforge.net/ Subjunc]''&lt;ref name="liao2013"/&gt; is a specialized version of Subread. It uses all mappable regions in an RNA-seq read to discover exons and exon-exon junctions. It uses the donor/receptor signals to find the exact splicing locations.

==Transcriptome assemblers==
The [[transcriptome]] is the total population of RNAs expressed in one cell or group of cells, including non-coding and protein-coding RNAs.
There are two types of approaches to assemble transcriptomes. Genome-guided methods use a reference [[genome]] (if possible a finished and high quality genome) as a template to align and assembling reads into transcripts. Genome-independent methods does not require a reference genome and are normally used when a genome is not available. In this case reads are assembled directly in transcripts. Some important comparative studies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayer|first1=Katharina E.|last2=Pizarro|first2=Angel|last3=Lahens|first3=Nicholas F.|last4=Hogenesch|first4=John B.|last5=Grant|first5=Gregory R.|title=Benchmark analysis of algorithms for determining and quantifying full-length mRNA splice forms from RNA-seq data|journal=Bioinformatics|date=3 September 2015|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btv488|pages=3938–45|pmid=26338770|pmc=4673975|volume=31|issue=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steijger2013&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Nat Methods |volume=10| year=2013 | author= Steijger T, Abril JF, Engström PG, Kokocinski F, Hubbard TJ, Guigó R, Harrow J, Bertone P; RGASP Consortium.| pmid=24185837| title = Assessment of transcript reconstruction methods for RNA-seq |doi=10.1038/nmeth.2714 | issue=12| pages=1177–84 | pmc=3851240}}&lt;/ref&gt; were already published.

* '''CLASS''' ''[http://sourceforge.net/p/splicebox/wiki/CLASS/ CLASS]''. CLASS is a program for assembling transcripts from RNA-seq reads aligned to a genome. CLASS produces a set of transcripts in three stages. Stage 1 uses linear programming to determine a set of exons for each gene. Stage 2 builds a splice graph representation of a gene, by connecting the exons (vertices) via introns (edges) extracted from spliced read alignments. Stage 3 selects a subset of the candidate transcripts encoded in the graph that can explain all the reads, using either a parsimonius (SET_COVER) or a dynamic programming optimization approach. This stage takes into account constraints derived from mate pairs and spliced alignments and, optionally, knowledge about gene structure extracted from known annotation or alignments of cDNA sequences.
* '''Cufflinks''' ''[http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/ Cufflinks]''. Cufflinks assembles transcripts, estimates their abundances, and tests for differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples. It accepts aligned RNA-Seq reads and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts. Cufflinks then estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how many reads support each one, taking into account biases in library preparation protocols.
* '''iReckon''' ''[http://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/ireckon/ iReckon]''. iReckon is an algorithm for the simultaneous isoform reconstruction and abundance estimation. In addition to modelling novel isoforms, multi-mapped reads and read duplicates, this method takes into account the possible presence of unspliced pre-mRNA and intron retention. iReckon only requires a set of transcription start and end sites, but can use known full isoforms to improve sensitivity. Starting from the set of nearly all possible isoforms, iReckon uses a regularized EM algorithm to determine those actually present in the sequenced sample, together with their abundances. iReckon is multi-threaded to increase efficiency in all its time consuming steps.
* '''IsoInfer''' ''[http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jianxing/IsoInfer.html IsoInfer]''. IsoInfer is a C/C++ program to infer isoforms based on short RNA-Seq (single-end and paired-end) reads, exon-intron boundary and TSS/PAS information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18109">This is a list of antioxidants naturally occurring in food. [[Vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]] &amp;ndash; which are ubiquitous among raw [[plant food]]s &amp;ndash; are confirmed as dietary antioxidants, whereas [[vitamin A]] becomes an antioxidant following [[metabolism]] of [[provitamin A]] [[beta-carotene]] and [[cryptoxanthin]]. Most food compounds listed as antioxidants &amp;ndash; such as [[polyphenol]]s common in colorful, edible plants &amp;ndash; have antioxidant activity only [[in vitro]], as their fate [[in vivo]] is to be rapidly metabolized and [[excretion|excreted]], and the in vivo properties of their [[metabolite]]s remain poorly understood. For antioxidants added to food to preserve them, see [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] and [[butylated hydroxytoluene]].

==Regulatory guidance==
In the following discussion, the term "antioxidant" refers mainly to non-nutrient compounds in foods, such as polyphenols, which have ''antioxidant capacity'' [[in vitro]] and so provide an artificial index of antioxidant strength – the ORAC measurement. Other than for dietary antioxidant vitamins – [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]] – no food compounds have been proved with antioxidant efficacy [[in vivo]]. Accordingly, regulatory agencies like the [[Food and Drug Administration]] of the United States and the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) have published guidance disallowing food product labels to claim an inferred antioxidant benefit when no such physiological evidence exists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/FDA-1995-N-0400-GDL.pdf Guidance for Industry, Food Labeling; Nutrient Content Claims; Definition for "High Potency" and Definition for "Antioxidant" for Use in Nutrient Content Claims for Dietary Supplements and Conventional Foods] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=efsa&gt;{{cite journal |author= EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies |year=2010 |title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to various food(s)/food constituent(s) and protection of cells from premature aging, antioxidant activity, antioxidant content and antioxidant properties, and protection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 |journal=EFSA Journal |volume=8 |issue=2 |page=1489 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological context==
Despite the above discussion implying that ORAC-rich foods with polyphenols may provide antioxidant benefits when in the diet, there remains no physiological evidence that any polyphenols have such actions or that ORAC has any relevance in the human body.

On the contrary, research indicates that although polyphenols are [[antioxidant]]s [[in vitro]], antioxidant effects [[in vivo]] are probably negligible or absent.&lt;ref name="Williams RJ, Spencer JP, Rice-Evans C 2004 838–49"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Robert J |last2=Spencer |first2=Jeremy P.E | authorlink2 = Jeremy P.

The increase in antioxidant capacity of blood seen after the consumption of polyphenol-rich (ORAC-rich) foods is not caused directly by the polyphenols, but most likely results from increased [[uric acid]] levels derived from metabolism of [[flavonoids]].&lt;ref name = Lotito/&gt;&lt;ref name="LPI"/&gt; According to Frei, "we can now follow the activity of flavonoids in the body, and one thing that is clear is that the body sees them as foreign compounds and is trying to get rid of them."&lt;ref name="LPI"/&gt; Another mechanism may be the increase in activities of [[paraoxonase]]s by dietary antioxidants which can reduce [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.mol.0000174398.84185.0f |last1=Aviram |first1=M |last2=Rosenblat |first2=M |title=Paraoxonases and cardiovascular diseases: pharmacological and nutritional influences |journal=Current Opinion in Lipidology |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=393–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15990587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vitamins ==
* [[Vitamin A]] (retinol), also [[Biosynthesis|synthesized]] by the body from [[beta-carotene]], protects dark green, yellow and orange vegetables and fruits from [[solar radiation]] damage, and is thought to play a similar role in the human body. [[Carrot]]s, [[squash (fruit)|squash]], [[broccoli]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[tomato]]es (which gain their color from the compound [[lycopene]]), [[kale]], [[mango]]es, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[seabuckthorn]] berries, [[wolfberries]] (goji), [[collards]], [[cantaloupe]], [[peach]]es and [[apricot]]s are particularly rich sources of [[beta-carotene]], the major [[provitamin A]] [[carotenoid]].
* [[Vitamin C]] (ascorbic acid) is a water-[[soluble]] compound that fulfills several roles in living systems. Sources include [[citrus]] fruits (such as [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[sweet lime]], etc.), [[Bell pepper|green peppers]], [[broccoli]], [[green leafy vegetable]]s, [[black currants]], [[strawberries]], [[blueberries]], [[seabuckthorn]], raw [[cabbage]] and [[tomato]]es.
* [[Vitamin E]], including [[tocotrienol]] and [[tocopherol]], is fat soluble and protects [[lipid]]s. Sources include [[wheat germ]], [[seabuckthorn]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[seed]]s, [[whole grain]]s, [[green leafy vegetables]], [[kiwifruit]], [[vegetable oil]], and [[Cod liver oil|fish-liver oil]]. Alpha-tocopherol is the main form in which vitamin E is consumed. Recent studies showed that some tocotrienol isomers have significant anti-oxidant properties.

==Vitamin cofactors and minerals==
* [[Coenzyme Q]]10
* [[Manganese]], particularly when in its +2 valence state as part of the enzyme called [[superoxide dismutase]] (SOD).
* [[Iodide]]

== Hormones ==
* [[Melatonin]]

* [[Zeaxanthin]] - best sources are kale, collard greens, spinach, turnip greens, Swiss chard, mustard and beet greens, corn, and broccoli

== Natural phenols ==
{{Main|Polyphenol}}
Natural phenols are a class of molecules found in abundance in plants.

=== Flavonoids ===
[[Flavonoid]]s, a subset of [[polyphenol antioxidant]]s, are present in many [[berry|berries]], as well as in [[coffee]] and [[tea]].
* [[Flavones]]:
** [[Apigenin]]
** [[Luteolin]]
** [[Tangeritin]]
* [[Flavonols]]:
** [[Isorhamnetin]]
** [[Kaempferol]]
** [[Myricetin]] - [[walnut]]s are a rich source
** [[Proanthocyanidin]]s, or [[condensed tannin]]s
** [[Quercetin]] and related, such as [[rutin]]
* Flavanones:
** [[Eriodictyol]]
** [[Hesperetin]] (metabolizes to [[hesperidin]])
** [[Naringenin]] (metabolized from [[naringin]])
* Flavanols and their polymers:
** [[Catechin]], [[gallocatechin]] and their corresponding [[gallic acid|gallate]] esters
** [[Epicatechin]], [[epigallocatechin]] and their corresponding gallate esters
** [[Theaflavin]] its gallate esters
** [[Thearubigin]]s
* [[Isoflavone]] [[phytoestrogens]] - found primarily in soy, peanuts, and other members of the Fabaceae family
** [[Daidzein]]
** [[Genistein]]
** [[Glycitein]]

* [[Anthocyanins]]
** [[Cyanidin]]
** [[Delphinidin]]
** [[Malvidin]]
** [[Pelargonidin]]
** [[Peonidin]]
** [[Petunidin]]

=== Phenolic acids and their esters ===
:{{main|polyphenol antioxidant}}
* [[Chicoric acid]] - another caffeic acid derivative, is found in chicory and Echinacea.
* [[Chlorogenic acid]] - found in high concentration in coffee (more concentrated in robusta than arabica beans), blueberries and tomatoes. Produced from esterification of caffeic acid.
* [[Cinnamic acid]] and its derivatives, such as [[ferulic acid]] - found in seeds of plants such as in brown rice, whole wheat and oats, as well as in coffee, apple, artichoke, peanut, orange and pineapple.
* [[Ellagic acid]] - found in high concentration in [[raspberry]] and [[strawberry]], and in ester form in red wine tannins.
* [[Ellagitannin]]s - hydrolyzable tannin polymer formed when ellagic acid, a polyphenol monomer, esterifies and binds with the hydroxyl group of a polyol carbohydrate such as glucose.
* [[Gallic acid]] - found in gallnuts, sumac, witch hazel, tea leaves, oak bark, and many other plants.
* [[Gallotannin]]s - hydrolyzable tannin polymer formed when gallic acid, a polyphenol monomer, esterifies and binds with the hydroxyl group of a polyol carbohydrate such as glucose.
* [[Rosmarinic acid]] - found in high concentration in [[rosemary]], [[oregano]], [[lemon balm]], [[Common sage|sage]], and [[marjoram]].
* [[Salicylic acid]] - found in most vegetables, fruits, and herbs; but most abundantly in the bark of willow trees, from where it was extracted for use in the early manufacture of [[aspirin]].

=== Other nonflavonoid phenolics ===
* [[Curcumin]] - Curcumin has low bioavailability, because, much of it is excreted through [[glucuronidation]]. However, bioavailability is substantially enhanced by solubilization in a lipid (oil or lecithin), heat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kurien |first1=Biji T. |last2=Singh |first2=Anil |last3=Matsumoto |first3=Hiroyuki |last4=Scofield |first4=R. Hal |title=Improving the Solubility and Pharmacological Efficacy of Curcumin by Heat Treatment |journal=ASSAY and Drug Development Technologies |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=567–76 |year=2007 |pmid=17767425 |doi=10.1089/adt.2007.064}}&lt;/ref&gt; addition of [[piperine]], or through nanoparticularization.
* Flavonolignans - e.g. [[silymarin]] - a mixture of flavonolignans extracted from [[milk thistle]].
* [[Xanthone]]s - [[mangosteen]] is purported to contain a large variety of xanthones,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticleAsOnePage.aspx?id=105902 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804162147/http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticleAsOnePage.aspx?id=105902 |date=August 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but some of the xanthones like [[mangostin]] might be present only in the [[Xanthone#Xanthone derivatives|inedible shell]].
* [[Eugenol]]

==Polyphenols in foods==
Many common foods contain rich sources of [[polyphenols]] which have antioxidant properties only in test tube studies. As interpreted by the [[Linus Pauling Institute]], dietary polyphenols have little or no direct antioxidant food value following digestion.&lt;ref name = Lotito&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lotito |first1=S |last2=Frei |first2=B |title=Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and increased plasma antioxidant capacity in humans: Cause, consequence, or epiphenomenon? |journal=Free Radical Biology and Medicine |volume=41 |issue=12 |pages=1727–46 |year=2006 |pmid=17157175 |doi=10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.04.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not like controlled test tube conditions, the fate of flavones or polyphenols [[in vivo]] shows they are poorly absorbed and poorly conserved (less than 5%), so that most of what is absorbed exists as metabolites modified during digestion, destined for rapid excretion.&lt;ref name="LPI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-03/osu-sfn030507.php|title=Studies force new view on biology of flavonoids|author=David Stauth|publisher=EurekAlert!; Adapted from a news release issued by Oregon State University|date=5 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spices, herbs, and [[essential oil]]s are rich in polyphenols in the plant itself and shown with antioxidant potential [[in vitro]]. Typical spices high in polyphenols (confirmed in vitro) are [[clove]], [[cinnamon]], [[oregano]], [[turmeric]], [[cumin]], [[parsley]], [[basil]], [[curry powder]], [[mustard seed]], [[ginger]], [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[chili powder]], [[paprika]], [[garlic]], [[coriander]], [[onion]] and [[cardamom]]. Typical herbs are [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[thyme]], [[marjoram]], [[tarragon]], [[peppermint]], [[oregano]], [[Summer savory|savory]], [[basil]] and [[dill weed]].

Dried fruits are a good source of polyphenols by weight/serving size as the water has been removed making the ratio of polyphenols higher. Typical dried fruits are pears, apples, plums, peaches, raisins, figs and dates. Dried raisins are high in polyphenol count. Red wine is high in total polyphenol count which supplies antioxidant quality which is unlikely to be conserved following digestion (see section below).

Deeply pigmented fruits like cranberries, blueberries, plums, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, blackcurrants, figs, cherries, guava, oranges, mango, grape juice and pomegranate juice also have significant polyphenol content.

Typical cooked vegetables rich in antioxidants are [[artichoke]]s, [[cabbage]], [[broccoli]], [[asparagus]], [[avocado]]s, [[beetroot]] and [[spinach]].

Nuts are a moderate source of polyphenol antioxidants. Typical nuts are [[pecan]]s, [[walnut]]s, [[hazelnut]]s, [[pistachio]], [[almond]]s, [[cashew nut]]s, [[macadamia nut]]s and [[peanut butter]].

Sorghum bran, [[Cocoa solids|cocoa]] powder, and [[cinnamon]] are rich sources of procyanidins, which are large [[molecular weight]] compounds found in many fruits and some vegetables. Partly due to the large molecular weight (size) of these compounds, their amount actually absorbed in the body is low, an effect also resulting from the action of stomach acids, enzymes and bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract where smaller derivatives are metabolized and prepared for rapid excretion.&lt;ref name = Lotito/&gt;&lt;ref name="LPI"/&gt;

== Other compounds ==
* [[Capsaicin]], the active component of chili peppers
* [[Bilirubin]], a breakdown product of blood, has been identified as a possible antioxidant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stocker |first1=R |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Y |last3=McDonagh |first3=A. |last4=Glazer |first4=A. |last5=Ames |first5=B. |title=Bilirubin is an antioxidant of possible physiological importance |journal=Science |volume=235 |issue=4792 |pages=1043–6 |year=1987 |pmid=3029864 |doi=10.1126/science.3029864|bibcode = 1987Sci...235.1043S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Citric acid]], [[oxalic acid]], and [[phytic acid]]
* N-[[Acetylcysteine]], water-soluble
* R-α-[[Lipoic acid]], fat- and water-soluble

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49765">'''Lunar theory''' attempts to account for the motions of the [[Moon]]. There are many small variations (or [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]s) in the Moon's motion, and many attempts have been made to account for them. After centuries of being problematic, lunar motion is now modeled to a very high degree of accuracy (see section [[#Modern developments|Modern developments]]).

Lunar theory includes:
* the background of general theory; including mathematical techniques used to analyze the Moon's motion and to generate formulae and algorithms for predicting its movements; and also
* quantitative formulae, algorithms, and geometrical diagrams that may be used to compute the Moon's position for a given time; often by the help of tables based on the algorithms.

Lunar theory has a history of over 2000 years of investigation. Its more modern developments have been used over the last three centuries for fundamental scientific and technological purposes, and are still being used in that way.

==Applications of lunar theory==
Applications of lunar theory have included the following:-
* In the eighteenth century, comparison between lunar theory and observation was used to test [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] by the [[Alexis Clairaut#Focus on astronomical motion|motion of the lunar apogee]].
* In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, navigational tables based on lunar theory, initially in the ''[[The Nautical Almanac|Nautical Almanac]]'', were much used for the determination of longitude at sea by the [[Lunar distance (navigation)#The reason for measuring lunar distances|method of lunar distances]].
* In the very early twentieth century, comparison between lunar theory and observation was used in another test of gravitational theory, to test (and rule out) [[Simon Newcomb]]'s suggestion that a well-known discrepancy in the [[Mercury (planet)#Advance of perihelion|motion of the perihelion of Mercury]] might be explained by a fractional adjustment of the power -2 in Newton's inverse square law of gravitation&lt;ref name=Brown1903&gt;[[#refBrown1903|E W Brown (1903)]].&lt;/ref&gt; (the discrepancy was later successfully explained by the [[general theory of relativity]]).
* In the mid-twentieth century, before the development of atomic clocks, lunar theory and observation were used in combination to implement an astronomical time scale ([[ephemeris time]]) free of the irregularities of mean solar time.
* In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, modern developments of lunar theory are being used in the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris]] series of models of the Solar System, in conjunction with [[Lunar laser ranging|high-precision observations]], to test the exactness of physical relationships associated with the [[general theory of relativity]], including the [[strong equivalence principle]], relativistic gravitation, [[geodetic precession]], and the constancy of the [[gravitational constant]].&lt;ref name=Willm2004&gt;[[#refWillm2004|J.G.Williams et al., (2004)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Moon has been observed for millennia. Over these ages, various levels of care and precision have been possible, according to the techniques of observation available at any time. There is a correspondingly long history of lunar theories: it stretches from the times of the Babylonian and Greek astronomers, down to modern lunar laser ranging.

Among notable astronomers and mathematicians down the ages, whose names are associated with lunar theories, are --

* Babylonian/Chaldean:- [[Naburimannu]], [[Kidinnu]], [[Soudines]]
* Greek/Hellenistic:- [[Hipparchus]], [[Ptolemy]]
* Arab:- [[Ibn al-Shatir]]
* European, 16th to early 20th centuries:-
* [[Tycho Brahe]]
* [[Johannes Kepler]]
* [[Jeremiah Horrocks]]
* [[Ismaël Bullialdus]]
* [[John Flamsteed]]
* [[Isaac Newton]]
* [[Leonhard Euler]]
* [[Alexis Clairaut]]
* [[Jean d'Alembert]]
* [[Tobias Mayer]]
* [[Johann Tobias Bürg]]
* [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]
* [[Johann Karl Burckhardt]]
* [[Peter Andreas Hansen]]
* [[Charles-Eugène Delaunay]]
* [[Ernest William Brown]]
* [[Wallace John Eckert]]
* Jean Chapront &amp; Michelle Chapront-Touzé

and other notable mathematical astronomers also made significant contributions, including: [[Edmond Halley]]; [[Philippe Gustave le Doulcet, Comte de Pontécoulant]]; [[John Couch Adams]]; [[George William Hill]]; and [[Simon Newcomb]].

The history can be considered to fall into three parts: from ancient times to Newton; the period of classical (Newtonian) physics; and modern developments.

==Ancient times to Newton==

===Babylon===
Of [[Babylonian astronomy]], practically nothing was known to historians of science before the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHAMA1975|Neugebauer (1975)]], volume&amp;nbsp;1 at [https://books.google.com/books?id=vO5FCVIxz2YC&amp;pg=PA347 pages&amp;nbsp;347-348].&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving ancient writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] had made bare mention of three astronomical schools in [[Mesopotamia]] &amp;ndash; at Babylon, Uruk, and 'Hipparenum' (possibly 'Sippar').&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHAMA1975|Neugebauer (1975)]], volume&amp;nbsp;1 at page&amp;nbsp;352.&lt;/ref&gt; But definite modern knowledge of any details only began when [[Joseph Epping]] deciphered cuneiform texts on clay tablets from a Babylonian archive: in these texts he identified an ephemeris of positions of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHAMA1975|Neugebauer (1975)]], volume&amp;nbsp;1 at page&amp;nbsp;349, citing [[#refEpping1881|Epping &amp; Strassmaier (1881)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, knowledge of the subject, still fragmentary, has had to be built up by painstaking analysis of deciphered texts, mainly in numerical form, on tablets from Babylon and Uruk (no trace has yet been found of anything from the third school mentioned by Pliny).

To the [[Babylon]]ian astronomer [[Kidinnu]] (in Greek or Latin, Kidenas or Cidenas) has been attributed the invention (5th or 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC) of what is now called “System &amp;nbsp;B” for predicting the position of the moon, taking account that the moon continually changes its speed along its path relative to the background of fixed stars. This system involved calculating daily stepwise changes of lunar speed, up or down, with a minimum and a maximum approximately each month.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHAMA1975|Neugebauer (1975)]], volume&amp;nbsp;1 at pages&amp;nbsp;476-482.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of these systems appears to have been arithmetical rather than geometrical, but they did approximately account for the main lunar inequality now known as the [[equation of the center]].

The Babylonians kept very accurate records for hundreds of years of new moons and eclipses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steele|first=J. M.|last2=Stephenson|first2=F. R.|last3=Morrison|first3=L. V.|date=1997-11-01|title=The Accuracy of Eclipse Times Measured by the Babylonians|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=28|pages=337|issn=0021-8286|bibcode = 1997JHA....28..337S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time between the years 500&amp;nbsp;BC and 400&amp;nbsp;BC they identified and began to use the 19&amp;nbsp;year cyclic relation between lunar months and solar years now known as the [[Metonic cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHAMA1975|Neugebauer (1975)]], volume&amp;nbsp;1 at pages&amp;nbsp;474 &amp; 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

This helped them built up a numerical theory of the main irregularities in the Moon's motion, reaching remarkably good estimates for the (different) periods of the three most prominent features of the Moon's motion:
*The synodic month, i.e. the mean period for the phases of the Moon. Now called “System&amp;nbsp;B”, it reckons the synodic month as 29&amp;nbsp;days and (sexagesimally) 3,11;0,50&amp;nbsp;“time degrees”. Each ''time degree'' is one degree of the apparent motion of the stars, or 4&amp;nbsp;[[minute (time)|minutes]] of time, and the sexagesimal values after the semicolon are fractions of a time degree. This converts to 29.530594&amp;nbsp;days = 29ᵈ&amp;nbsp;12ʰ&amp;nbsp;44ᵐ&amp;nbsp;3.33ˢ,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHAMA1975|Neugebauer (1975)]], volume 1 at page 483.&lt;/ref&gt; to compare with a modern value (as at 1900 Jan&amp;nbsp;0) of 29.530589&amp;nbsp;days, or 29ᵈ&amp;nbsp;12ʰ&amp;nbsp;44ᵐ&amp;nbsp;2.9ˢ.&lt;ref name=ES1961-p107&gt;[[#refES1961|Explanatory Supplement (1961) to the Astronomical Ephemeris]], at page 107.&lt;/ref&gt; This same value was used by Hipparchos and Ptolemy, was used throughout the Middle Ages, and still forms the basis of the [[Hebrew calendar]].
*The mean lunar velocity relative to the stars they estimated at 13°&amp;nbsp;10&amp;prime;&amp;nbsp;35&amp;Prime; per day, giving a corresponding month of 27.321598&amp;nbsp;days,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHAMA1975|Neugebauer (1975)]], volume&amp;nbsp;1 at pages&amp;nbsp;476-478.&lt;/ref&gt; to compare with modern values of 13°&amp;nbsp;10&amp;prime;&amp;nbsp;35.0275&amp;Prime; and 27.321582&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name=ES1961-p107 /&gt;
*The anomalistic month, i.e. the mean period for the Moon's approximately monthly accelerations and decelerations in its rate of movement against the stars, had a Babylonian estimate of 27.5545833&amp;nbsp;days,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHAMA1975|Neugebauer (1975)]], volume&amp;nbsp;1 at page&amp;nbsp;501.&lt;/ref&gt; to compare with a modern value 27.554551&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name=ES1961-p107 /&gt;
*The draconitic month, i.e. the mean period with which the path of the Moon against the stars deviates first north and then south in ecliptic latitude by comparison with the ecliptic path of the Sun, was indicated by a number of different parameters leading to various estimates, e.g. of 27.212204&amp;nbsp;days,&lt;ref name=HAMA518&gt;[[#refHAMA1975|Neugebauer (1975)]], volume&amp;nbsp;1 at [https://books.google.com/books?id=vO5FCVIxz2YC&amp;pg=PA518 page&amp;nbsp;518].&lt;/ref&gt; to compare with a modern value of 27.212221,&lt;ref name=ES1961-p107 /&gt; but the Babylonians also had a numerical relationship that 5458&amp;nbsp;synodic months were equal to 5923&amp;nbsp;draconitic months,&lt;ref name=HAMA518 /&gt; which when compared with their accurate value for the synodic month leads to practically exactly the modern figure for the draconitic month.

The Babylonian estimate for the synodic month was adopted for the greater part of two millennia by Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and medieval writers (and it is still in use as part of the basis for the calculated [[Hebrew calendar#Measurement of month|Hebrew (Jewish) calendar]]).

===Greece and Hellenistic Egypt===
Thereafter, from [[Hipparchus]] and [[Ptolemy]] in the [[Bithynia]]n and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] epochs down to the time of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s work in the seventeenth century, lunar theories were composed mainly with the help of geometrical ideas, inspired more or less directly by long series of positional observations of the moon. Prominent in these geometrical lunar theories were combinations of circular motions &amp;ndash; applications of the theory of epicycles.&lt;ref name=Drey1906&gt;[[#refDrey1906|J L E Dreyer (1906)]], especially chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hipparchus====
{{See also|Hipparchus#Orbit of the Moon|l1=Hipparchus: Orbit of the Moon}}

[[Hipparchus]], whose works are mostly lost and known mainly from quotations by other authors, assumed that the Moon moved in a circle inclined at 5° to the [[ecliptic]], rotating in a retrograde direction (i.e. opposite to the direction of annual and monthly apparent movements of the Sun and Moon relative to the fixed stars) once in 18{{fraction|2|3}} years. The circle acted as a deferent, carrying an epicycle along which the Moon was assumed to move in a retrograde direction. The center of the epicycle moved at a rate corresponding to the mean change in Moon's longitude, while the period of the Moon around the epicycle was an anomalistic month. This epicycle approximately provided for what was later recognized as the elliptical inequality, the [[equation of the center]], and its size approximated to an equation of the center of about 5° 1'. This figure is much smaller than [[#Equation of the center|the modern value]]: but it is close to the difference between the modern coefficients of the equation of the center (1st term) and that of the [[#Evection|evection]]: the difference is accounted for by the fact that the ancient measurements were taken at times of eclipses, and the effect of the evection (which subtracts under those conditions from the equation of the center) was at that time unknown and overlooked. ''For further information see also separate article [[Evection]].''

====Ptolemy====
[[Ptolemy]]'s work the ''[[Almagest]]'' had wide and long-lasting acceptance and influence for over a millennium. He gave a geometrical lunar theory that improved on that of Hipparchus by providing for a second inequality of the Moon's motion, using a device that made the apparent apogee oscillate a little &amp;ndash; ''prosneusis'' of the epicycle. This ''second inequality'' or ''second anomaly'' accounted rather approximately, not only for the equation of the center, but also for what became known (much later) as the [[#Evection|evection]]. But this theory, applied to its logical conclusion, would make the distance (and apparent diameter) of the Moon appear to vary by a factor of about 2, which is clearly not seen in reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHAMA1975|Neugebauer (1975)]], volume 1 at pages 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt; (The apparent angular diameter of the Moon does vary monthly, but only over a much narrower range of about 0.49°&amp;ndash;0.55°.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [[#refNAAE1871|Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for 1871]], especially [https://books.google.com/books?id=e_wNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PT209 at p.&amp;nbsp;224 (Dec 1871)], (showing range of Moon's diameters near its widest for the half-year, ranging 0.491°&amp;ndash;0.559° 12&amp;ndash;26&amp;nbsp;Dec 1871, to compare with other nearby months e.g. Aug-Nov where the range is not so wide).&lt;/ref&gt;) This defect of the Ptolemaic theory led to proposed replacements by Ibn al-Shatir in the 14th&amp;nbsp;century&lt;ref name="Arabic Astronomy p. 236"&gt;[[George Saliba]]. (1994). ''A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam'', p.&amp;nbsp;236. [[New York University Press]], {{ISBN|0-8147-8023-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Copernicus in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDrey1906|J L E Dreyer (1906)]], especially chapter&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ibn al-Shatir and Copernicus===
Significant advances in lunar theory made by the [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Arab astronomer]], [[Ibn al-Shatir]]&amp;nbsp;(1304–1375). Drawing on the observation that the distance to the Moon did not change as drastically as required by Ptolemy's lunar model, he produced a new lunar model that replaced Ptolemy's crank mechanism with a double epicycle model that reduced the computed range of distances of the Moon from the Earth.&lt;ref name="Arabic Astronomy p. 236"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHAMA1975|Neugebauer (1975)]], volume&amp;nbsp;3 at pages&amp;nbsp;1108-1109.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar lunar theory, developed some 150&amp;nbsp;years later by the [[Renaissance]] astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], had the same advantage concerning the lunar distances.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHAMA1975|Neugebauer (1975)]], volume&amp;nbsp;3 at page&amp;nbsp;1109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutzwiller|first1=Martin C.|title=Moon-Earth-Sun: The oldest three-body problem|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|date=1998|volume=70|pages=589–639|bibcode = 1998RvMP...70..589G |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.70.589 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, and Jeremiah Horrocks===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
[[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]] refined the Ptolemaic lunar theory, but did not overcome its central defect of giving a poor account of the (mainly monthly) variations in the Moon's distance, apparent diameter and [[Parallax#Lunar parallax|parallax]]. Their work added to the lunar theory three substantial further discoveries.
# The nodes and the inclination of the lunar orbital plane both appear to [[Libration|librate]], with a monthly (according to Tycho) or semi-annual period (according to Kepler).
# The lunar longitude has a twice-monthly ''[[#Variation|Variation]]'', by which the Moon moves faster than expected at new and full moon, and slower than expected at the quarters.
#There is also an annual effect, by which the lunar motion slows down a little in January and speeds up a little in July: the ''annual equation''.

The refinements of Brahe and Kepler were recognized by their immediate successors as improvements, but their seventeenth-century successors tried numerous alternative geometrical configurations for the lunar motions to improve matters further. A notable success was achieved by [[Jeremiah Horrocks]], who proposed a scheme involving an approximate 6&amp;nbsp;monthly libration in the position of the lunar apogee and also in the size of the elliptical eccentricity. This scheme had the great merit of giving a more realistic description of the changes in distance, diameter and parallax of the Moon.

==Newton==

A first gravitational period for lunar theory started with the work of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. He was the first to define the problem of the perturbed motion of the Moon in recognisably modern terms. His groundbreaking work is shown for example in the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''&lt;ref name=Pr-Eng&gt;English translations of the Principia (3rd edition, 1726) have been made by: [[#refCohn1999|I B Cohen (1999)]], a modern English translation with Guide; also [[#refMott1729a|Andrew Motte (translator) (1729a)]] (the original English translation, Volume 1, containing Book 1); and [[#refMott1729b|Andrew Motte (translator) (1729b)]] (Volume 2, containing Books 2 and 3, index, additional Newton papers and a tract on the Moon by John Machin).&lt;/ref&gt; in all versions including the first edition published in 1687.

===Solar perturbation of lunar motion===
Newton identified how to evaluate the perturbing effect on the relative motion of the Earth and Moon, arising from their gravity towards the Sun, in Book&amp;nbsp;1, Proposition&amp;nbsp;66,&lt;ref name=Pr1729-P66&gt;'Principia', [[#refMott1729a|Andrew Motte (1729a)]], at [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA234 Book 1, Prop.66, p.234], referring to diagram "Fig.2" on an unnumbered page following next after [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA268-IA1 page 268].&lt;/ref&gt; and in Book 3, Proposition 25.&lt;ref name=Pr1729-P3-25&gt;'Principia', [[#refMott1729b|Andrew Motte (1729b)]], at [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA262 Book 3, Prop.25, p.262].&lt;/ref&gt; The starting-point for this approach is Corollary VI to the laws of motion.&lt;ref name=PR1729-C6&gt;'Principia', [[#refMott1729a|Andrew Motte (1729a)]], at [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA31 Corollary VI to the laws of motion, page 31].&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that if the external accelerative forces from some massive body happens to act equally and in parallel on some different other bodies considered, then those bodies would be affected equally, and in that case their motions (relative to each other) would continue as if there were no such external accelerative forces at all. It is only in the case that the external forces (e.g. in Book&amp;nbsp;1, Prop.&amp;nbsp;66, and Book&amp;nbsp;3, Prop.&amp;nbsp;25, the gravitational attractions towards the Sun) are different in size or in direction in their accelerative effects on the different bodies considered (e.g. on the Earth and Moon), that consequent effects are appreciable on the relative motions of the latter bodies. (Newton referred to ''accelerative forces'' or ''accelerative gravity'' due to some external massive attractor such as the Sun. The measure he used was the acceleration that the force tends to produce (in modern terms, force per unit mass), rather than what we would now call the force itself.)

Thus Newton concluded that it is only the '''difference''' between the Sun's accelerative attraction on the Moon and the Sun's attraction on the Earth that perturbs the motion of the Moon relative to the Earth.

Newton then in effect used [[vector decomposition]] of forces,&lt;ref name=PR1729-C1&gt;''Principia'', [[#refMott1729a|Andrew Motte (1729a)]]; where Newton shows the parallelogram of forces at [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA21 Corollary&amp;nbsp;I to the laws of motion, page&amp;nbsp;21].&lt;/ref&gt; to carry out this analysis. In Book&amp;nbsp;1, Proposition&amp;nbsp;66 and in Book&amp;nbsp;3, Proposition&amp;nbsp;25,&lt;ref name=prop3-25&gt;'Principia', [[#refMott1729b|Andrew Motte (1729b)]], at [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA262 Book 3, Proposition&amp;nbsp;25, page&amp;nbsp;262].&lt;/ref&gt; he showed by a geometrical construction, starting from the total gravitational attraction of the Sun on the Earth, and of the Sun on the Moon, the difference that represents the perturbing effect on the motion of the Moon relative to the Earth. In summary, line&amp;nbsp;LS in Newton's diagram as shown below represents the size and direction of the perturbing acceleration acting on the Moon in the Moon's current position&amp;nbsp;P (line&amp;nbsp;LS does not pass through point&amp;nbsp;P, but the text shows that this is not intended to be significant, it is a result of the scale factors and the way the diagram has been built up).

[[File:096-newt1687-figp434.jpg|right|thumbnail|470px|Newton's diagram 'to find the force of the Sun to perturb the Moon' accompanying Book&amp;nbsp;3, Proposition&amp;nbsp;25 of the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'']]
Shown here is Newton's diagram from the first (1687) Latin edition of the ''Principia'' (Book&amp;nbsp;3, Proposition&amp;nbsp;25, at p.&amp;nbsp;434). Here he introduced his analysis of perturbing accelerations on the Moon in the Sun-Earth-Moon system. '''Q''' represents the Sun, '''S''' the Earth, and '''P''' the Moon.

Parts of this diagram represent distances, other parts gravitational accelerations (attractive forces per unit mass). In a dual significance, SQ represents the Earth-Sun distance, and then it also represents the size and direction of the Earth-Sun gravitational acceleration. Other distances in the diagram are then in proportion to distance SQ. Other attractions are in proportion to attraction SQ.

The Sun's attractions are SQ (on the Earth) and LQ (on the Moon). The size of LQ is drawn so that the ratio of attractions LQ:SQ is the inverse square of the ratio of distances PQ:SQ. (Newton constructs KQ=SQ, giving an easier view of the proportions.) The Earth's attraction on the Moon acts along direction PS. (But line PS signifies only distance and direction so far, nothing has been defined about the scale factor between solar and terrestrial attractions).

After showing solar attractions LQ on the Moon and SQ on the Earth, on the same scale, Newton then makes a vector decomposition of LQ into components LM and MQ. Then he identifies the perturbing acceleration on the Moon as the difference of this from SQ. SQ and MQ are parallel to each other, so SQ can be directly subtracted from MQ, leaving MS. The resulting difference, after subtracting SQ from LQ, is therefore the vector sum of LM and MS: these add up to a perturbing acceleration LS.

Later Newton identified another resolution of the perturbing acceleration LM+MS = LS, into orthogonal components: a transverse component parallel to LE, and a radial component, effectively ES.

[[File:09a-2moonperts.jpg|right|thumbnail|450px|Alternative depiction of solar perturbations, vectors LS1 and LS2, like LS in Newton's diagram above, for 2 positions of the Moon P in its orbit around the Earth S]]
Newton's diagrammatic scheme, since his time, has been re-presented in other and perhaps visually clearer ways. Shown here is a vector presentation&lt;ref&gt;(adapted in part from F R Moulton (1914), "Introduction to Celestial Mechanics".)&lt;/ref&gt; indicating, for two different positions, P1 and P2, of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth, the respective vectors LS1 and LS2 for the perturbing acceleration due to the Sun. The Moon's position at P1 is fairly close to what it was at P in Newton's diagram; corresponding perturbation LS1 is like Newton's LS in size and direction. At another position P2, the Moon is farther away from the Sun than the Earth is, the Sun's attraction LQ2 on the Moon is weaker than the Sun's attraction SQ=SQ2 on the Earth, and then the resulting perturbation LS2 points obliquely away from the Sun.

[[File:Field tidal.svg|right|thumbnail|250px|Solar perturbation vectors (arrows) analogous to LS at many positions of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth]]
Constructions like those in Newton's diagram can be repeated for many different positions of the Moon in its orbit. For each position, the result is a perturbation vector like LS1 or LS2 in the second diagram. Shown here is an often-presented form of the diagram that summarises sizes and directions of the perturbation vectors for many different positions of the Moon in its orbit. Each small arrow is a perturbation vector like LS, applicable to the Moon in the particular position around the orbit from which the arrow begins. The perturbations on the Moon when it is nearly in line along the Earth-Sun axis, i.e. near new or full moon, point outwards, away from the Earth. When the Moon-Earth line is 90° from the Earth-Sun axis they point inwards, towards the Earth, with a size that is only half the maximum size of the axial (outwards) perturbations. (Newton gave a rather good quantitative estimate for the size of the solar perturbing force: at [[Quadrature (astronomy)|quadrature]] where it adds to the Earth's attraction he put it at {{frac|1|178.725}} of the mean terrestrial attraction, and twice as much as that at the new and full moons where it opposes and diminishes the Earth's attraction.)&lt;ref name=prop3-25 /&gt;

Newton also showed that the same pattern of perturbation applies, not only to the Moon, in its relation to the Earth as disturbed by the Sun, but also to other particles more generally in their relation to the solid Earth as disturbed by the Sun (or by the Moon); for example different portions of the tidal waters at the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;(The overall tide-generating force on the Earth's tidal waters results from the superposition of two of these similar patterns, one of them due to the Sun, the other due to the Moon as external perturbing body. The superposition varies in its overall effect depending on the angular relation of Sun and Moon at the considered time.)&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the common pattern of these perturbing accelerations grew out of Newton's initial study of the perturbations of the Moon, which he also applied to the forces moving tidal waters. Nowadays this common pattern itself has become often known as a [[tidal force]] whether it is being applied to the disturbances of the motions of the Moon, or of the Earth's tidal waters &amp;ndash; or of the motions of any other object that suffers perturbations of analogous pattern.

After introducing his diagram 'to find the force of the Sun to perturb the Moon' in Book&amp;nbsp;3, Proposition&amp;nbsp;25, Newton developed a first approximation to the solar perturbing force, showing in further detail how its components vary as the Moon follows its monthly path around the Earth. He also took the first steps in investigating how the perturbing force shows its effects by producing irregularities in the lunar motions. (In this part of the enterprise, Newton's success was more limited: it is relatively uncomplicated to define the perturbing forces, but heavy complexities soon arise in the problem of working out the resulting motions, and these were to challenge mathematical astronomers for two centuries after Newton's initial definition of the problem and indication of the directions to take in solving it.)

For a selected few of the lunar inequalities, Newton showed in some quantitative detail how they arise from the solar perturbing force.

Much of this lunar work of Newton's was done in the 1680s, and the extent and accuracy of his first steps in the gravitational analysis was limited by several factors, including his own choice to develop and present the work in what was, on the whole, a difficult geometrical way, and by the limited accuracy and uncertainty of many astronomical measurements in his time.

==Classical gravitational period after Newton==

The main aim of Newton's successors, from [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Alexis Clairaut]] and [[Jean d'Alembert]] in the mid-eighteenth century, down to [[Ernest William Brown|E.W. Brown]] in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, was to account completely and much more precisely for the moon's motions on the basis of Newton's laws, i.e. the [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and of [[universal gravitation]] by attractions inversely proportional to the squares of the distances between the attracting bodies. They also wished to put the inverse-square law of gravitation to the test, and for a time in the 1740s it was seriously doubted, on account of what was then thought to be a large discrepancy between the Newton-theoretical and the observed rates in the motion of the lunar apogee. However Clairaut [[Alexis Clairaut#Focus on astronomical motion|showed]] shortly afterwards (1749–50) that at least the major cause of the discrepancy lay not in the lunar theory based on Newton's laws, but in excessive approximations that he and others had relied on to evaluate it.

Most of the improvements in theory after Newton were made in algebraic form: they involved voluminous and highly laborious amounts of infinitesimal calculus and trigonometry. It also remained necessary, for completing the theories of this period, to refer to observational measurements.&lt;ref name=Godf1885&gt;[[#refGodf1885|H Godfray (1885)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown1896&gt;[[#refBrown1896|E W Brown (1896)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown1919&gt;[[#refBrown1919|E W Brown (1919)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ILE1954&gt;[[#refILE1954|W J Eckert et al. (1954)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results of the theories===

The lunar theorists used (and invented) many different mathematical approaches to analyse the gravitational problem. Not surprisingly, their results tended to converge. From the time of the earliest gravitational analysts among Newton's successors, [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], [[Alexis Clairaut|Clairaut]] and [[Jean d'Alembert|d'Alembert]], it was recognized that nearly all of the main lunar perturbations could be expressed in terms of just a few angular arguments and coefficients. These can be represented by:&lt;ref name=ILE1954 /&gt;
*the mean motions or positions of the Moon and the Sun, together with three coefficients and three angular positions, which together define the shape and location of their apparent orbits:
*the two eccentricities (&lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt;, about 0.0549, and &lt;math&gt; e' &lt;/math&gt;, about 0.01675) of the ellipses that approximate to the apparent orbits of the Moon and the Sun;
*the angular direction of the perigees (&lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Gamma' &lt;/math&gt;) (or their opposite points the apogees) of the two orbits; and
*the angle of inclination (&lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, mean value about 18523") between the planes of the two orbits, together with the direction (&lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;) of the line of nodes in which those two planes intersect. The ascending node (&lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;) is the node passed by the Moon when it is tending northwards relative to the ecliptic.

From these basic parameters, just four basic differential angular arguments are enough to express, in their different combinations, nearly all of the most significant perturbations of the lunar motions. They are given here with their conventional symbols due to [[Charles-Eugène Delaunay|Delaunay]]; they are sometimes known as the Delaunay arguments:
* &lt;math&gt; l &lt;/math&gt; the Moon's mean anomaly (angular distance of the mean longitude of the Moon from the mean longitude of its perigee &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;);
* &lt;math&gt; l' &lt;/math&gt; the Sun's mean anomaly (angular distance of the mean longitude of the Sun from the mean longitude of its perigee &lt;math&gt;\Gamma'&lt;/math&gt;);
* &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt; the Moon's mean argument of latitude (angular distance of the mean longitude of the Moon from the mean longitude of its ascending (northward-bound) node &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;);
* &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; the Moon's mean (solar) elongation (angular distance of the mean longitude of the Moon from the mean longitude of the Sun).

This work culminated into [[Ernest William Brown|Brown]]'s lunar theory (1897-1908)&lt;ref name=Brown1897&gt;[[#refBrown1897|E W Brown (1897)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown1899&gt;[[#refBrown1899|E W Brown (1899)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown1900&gt;[[#refBrown1900|E W Brown (1900)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown1905&gt;[[#refBrown1905|E W Brown (1905)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown1908&gt;[[#refBrown1908|E W Brown (1908)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Tables of the Motion of the Moon'' (1919).&lt;ref name=Brown1919 /&gt; These were used in the [[American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac]] until 1968, and in a modified form until 1984.

===Largest or named lunar inequalities===
Several of the largest lunar perturbations in longitude (contributions to the difference in its true ecliptic longitude relative to its mean longitude) have been named. In terms of the differential arguments, they can be expressed in the following way, with coefficients rounded to the nearest second of arc ("):&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBrown1919|E W Brown (1919)]], at [https://archive.org/stream/tablesofmotionof12browrich#page/n33/mode/1up pages 8–28].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Equation of the center====
{{See also|Equation of the center}}
* The Moon's equation of the center, or elliptic inequality, was known at least in approximation, to the ancients from the Babylonians and Hipparchus onwards. Knowledge of more recent date is that it corresponds to the approximate application of [[Kepler]]'s law of equal areas in an elliptical orbit, and represents the speeding-up of the Moon as its distance from the Earth decreases while it moves towards its perigee, and then its slowing down as its distance from the Earth increases while it moves towards its apogee. The effect on the Moon's longitude can be approximated by a series of terms, of which the first three are &lt;math&gt;+22639''\sin(l) +769''\sin(2l) +36''\sin(3l)&lt;/math&gt; .

====Evection====
{{See also|Evection}}
* The evection (or its approximation) was known to Ptolemy, but its name and knowledge of its cause dates from the 17th century. Its effect on the Moon's longitude has an odd-appearing period of about 31.8 days. This can be represented in a number of ways, for example as the result of an approximate 6-monthly libration in the position of perigee, with an accompanying 6-monthly pulsation in the size of the Moon's orbital eccentricity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGodf1885|H Godfray (1885)]], at pages 68–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal term is &lt;math&gt;+4586''\sin(2D-l)&lt;/math&gt; .

====Variation====
{{See also|Variation (astronomy)}}
* The Variation, discovered by Tycho Brahe, is a speeding-up of the Moon as it approaches new-moon and full-moon, and a slowing-down as it approaches first and last quarter. Its gravitational explanation with a quantitative estimate was first given by Newton. Its principal term is &lt;math&gt;+2370''\sin(2D)&lt;/math&gt; .

====Annual equation====
* The annual equation, also discovered by Brahe, was qualitatively explained by Newton in terms that the Moon's orbit becomes slightly expanded in size, and longer in period, when the Earth is at perihelion closest to the Sun at the beginning of January, and the Sun's perturbing effect is strongest, and then slightly contracted in size and shorter in period when the Sun is most distant in early July, so that its perturbing effect is weaker: the modern value for the principal term due to this effect is &lt;math&gt;-668''\sin(l')&lt;/math&gt; .

====Parallactic inequality====
* The parallactic inequality, first found by Newton, makes Brahe's Variation a little asymmetric as a result of the finite distance and non-zero parallax of the Sun. Its effect is that the Moon is a little behind at first quarter, and a little ahead at last quarter. Its principal term is &lt;math&gt;-125''\sin(D)&lt;/math&gt; .

====Reduction to the Ecliptic====
* The reduction to the ecliptic represents the geometric effect of expressing the Moon's motion in terms of a longitude in the plane of the ecliptic, although its motion is really taking place in a plane that is inclined by about 5 degrees. Its principal term is &lt;math&gt;-412''\sin(2F)&lt;/math&gt; .

The analysts of the mid-18th century expressed the perturbations of the Moon's position in longitude using about 25-30 trigonometrical terms.  However, work in the nineteenth and twentieth century led to very different formulations of the theory so these terms are no longer current. The number of terms needed to express the Moon's position with the accuracy sought at the beginning of the twentieth century was over 1400; and the number of terms needed to emulate the accuracy of modern numerical integrations based on laser-ranging observations is in the tens of thousands: there is no limit to the increase in number of terms needed as requirements of accuracy increase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988momo.book.....C The motion of the moon, Alan Cook, published Adam Hilger, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern developments==

=== Digital computers and Lunar Laser Ranging ===
[[File:Goddard Spaceflight Center Laser Ranging Facility.jpg|thumb|right|The Laser Ranging Facility at [[Goddard Spaceflight Center]]]]
Since the Second World War and especially since the 1960s, lunar theory has been further developed in a somewhat different way. This has been stimulated in two ways: on the one hand, by the use of automatic digital computation, and on the other hand, by modern observational data-types, with greatly increased accuracy and precision.

[[Wallace John Eckert]], a student of [[Ernest William Brown]] who worked at IBM, used the experimental digital computers developed there after the Second World War for computation of astronomical ephemerides. One of the projects was to put Brown's lunar theory into the machine and evaluate the expressions directly. Another project was something entirely new: a [[numerical integration]] of the equations of motion for the Sun and the four major planets. This became feasible only after electronic digital computers became available. Eventually this led to the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris]] series.

In the meantime, Brown's theory was improved with better constants and the introduction of [[Ephemeris Time]] and the removal of some empirical corrections associated with this. This led to the Improved Lunar Ephemeris (ILE),&lt;ref name=ILE1954 /&gt; which, with some minor successive improvements, was used in the astronomical almanacs from 1960 through 1983 (ILE j=0 from 1960 to 1967, ILE j=1 from 1968 to 1971, ILE j=2 from 1972 to 1983),&lt;ref name=refChapront2002&gt;[[#refChapront2002|M Chapront-Touzé &amp; J Chapront (2002), pp.&amp;nbsp;21-22.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was used in lunar landing missions.

The most significant improvement of position observations of the Moon have been the [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment|Lunar Laser Ranging]] measurements, obtained using Earth-bound lasers and special retro-reflectors placed on the surface of the Moon. The time-of-flight of a pulse of laser light to one of the reflectors and back gives a measure of the Moon's distance at that time. The first of five reflectors that are operational today was taken to the Moon in the ''[[Apollo 11]]'' spacecraft in July 1969 and placed in a suitable position on the Moon's surface by [[Neil Armstrong]].&lt;ref name=refDick1994&gt;[[#refDick1994|J O Dickey et al. (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Its precision is still being extended further by the [[Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation]], established in 2005.

=== Numerical integrations, relativity, tides, librations ===
The lunar theory, as developed numerically to fine precision using these modern measures, is based on a larger range of considerations than the classical theories: it takes account not only of gravitational forces (with relativistic corrections) but also of many tidal and geophysical effects and a greatly extended theory of lunar [[libration]]. Like many other scientific fields this one has now developed so as to be based on the work of large teams and institutions. An institution notably taking one of the leading parts in these developments has been the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] at [[California Institute of Technology]]; and names particularly associated with the transition, from the early 1970s onwards, from classical lunar theories and ephemerides towards the modern state of the science include those of J Derral Mulholland and J G Williams (and for the linked development of solar system (planetary) ephemerides E Myles Standish).&lt;ref name=LLR197x&gt;Representative documents include (1) [[#refDBH1970|D B Holdridge &amp; J D Mulholland (1970)]], (2) [[#refWillm1972|J G Williams et al. (1972)]], (3) [[#refMulh1973|J D Mulholland &amp; P J Shelus (1973)]], (4) [[#refXnew1983|X X Newhall, E M Standish, J G Williams (1983)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) has produced a series of numerically integrated [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|Development Ephemerides]] (numbered DExxx), incorporating Lunar Ephemerides (LExxx). Planetary and lunar ephemerides DE200/LE200 were used in the official Astronomical Almanac ephemerides for 1984–2002, and ephemerides [[DE405|DE405/LE405]], of further improved accuracy and precision, have been in use as from the issue for 2003.&lt;ref name=USNO2009&gt;[[#refUSNO2009|U S Naval Obervatory (2009)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analytical developments ===
In parallel with these developments, a new class of analytical lunar theory has also been developed in recent years, notably the [[Ephemeride Lunaire Parisienne]]&lt;ref name=ChapELP&gt;[[#refChap1983|M Chapront-Touzé, J Chapront &amp; G Francou (1983, 1988, 2002, 2003)]]&lt;/ref&gt; by Jean Chapront and Michelle Chapront-Touzé from the [[Bureau des Longitudes]]. Using computer-assisted algebra, the analytical developments have been taken further than previously could be done by the classical analysts working manually. Also, some of these new analytical theories (like ELP) have been fitted to the numerical ephemerides previously developed at JPL as mentioned above. The main aims of these recent analytical theories, in contrast to the aims of the classical theories of past centuries, have not been to generate improved positional data for current dates; rather, their aims have included the study of further aspects of the motion, such as long-term properties, which may not so easily be apparent from the modern numerical theories themselves.&lt;ref name=Chap2003&gt;[[#refChap2003|J Chapront &amp; G Francou (2001)]], and citations therein.&lt;/ref&gt;

When looking at the electronic market it becomes obvious, as there is a need for production output, high system performance, product reliability and long lifecycle, for [[Microelectromechanical systems]](MEMS) to create trust in the eyes of customers. If those conditions would not be met customers would not invest into technologies using MEMS, which justifies the need for testing as a part of a high quality standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osten|first=Wolfgang|title=Optical inspection of microsystems|year=2007|publisher=CRC/Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=0849336821|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing is also fairly important from an economical point of view. As it is said that the failure cost increase by a factor of ten for each stage before it gets discovered.
Most MEMS producers check their products at two distinct stages(at the wafer level, and the packaging), as well as random sampling on every stage.
If one includes this into cost calculation for a MEMS device the costs for testing amounts to 20-50% of the overall unit costs.
Even when looking at producers that manufacture MEMS, and [[CMOS]] devices it is not really possible to reduce the costs by including the economy of scopes effect for testing, as both types of device. This is because even though about 80% of the processing is shared, only 20% of the tests are.
To decrease these costs for U.S manufactures the National Institute of Standards and Technologies([[NIST]]) conducted several workshops and questionnaires to tackle this issue and increase competitiveness of US companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moyer|first=Bryon|title=The MEMS Testing Quagmire|journal=Journal Electronic Engineering|date=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What is tested?==
Due to the wide variety of MEMS it is hard to be very specific as of what is tested the table below shows what is tested in general:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Material Property Test !! Fabrication Test !! Device Level Metrology
|-
| Residual Stress || Doping || Grain Size
|-
| Fracture / Failure Mechanism || Etching Parameters || Surface Roughness
|-
| Etch parameters (shape and dimension) || Deposition methods || High Resolution Cross Section
|-
| Elastic Modulus || Post Release Etching || Micro Scale Crack Propagation
|-
| Poisson's ratio || Post release Drying (Stiction) || Real-Time Performance settling time, amplitude of movement or resonance frequency
|-

==Different technologies==
To test MEMS researchers came up with a wide variety of techniques that can display certain values. However, there is no single technology that can cover all; each has strengths as well as weaknesses.

Below is a list with all major and some minor technologies employed in MEMS testing:

* [[Atomic force microscopy]] (AFM)
* [[Confocal microscopy]] (CM)
* [[Digital holographic microscopy]] (DHM)
* [[Laser Doppler vibrometer]] (LDV)
* [[Optical microscopy]] (OM)
* [[Scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM)
* [[Strobe video microscopy]] (SVM)
* [[White light interferometry]] (WLI)

Following technologies were experimented with but are no longer considered for MEMS testing:

* [[Beam deflection]]
* [[Electronic speckle pattern interferometry]] (ESPI)
* [[Ellipsometry]]
* [[Light scattering]]
* [[Spectroscopy]]

All these technologies have strengths and weaknesses, so in order to maximize the effectiveness of test equipment researchers combined technologies. For instance Christian Rembe, former researcher at UC Berkley, combined laser doppler vibrometry, white light interferometry and strobe video microscopy into one tool to eliminate each technologies weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osten|first=Wolfgang|title=Optical inspection of microsystems|year=2007|publisher=CRC/Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=0849336821|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Metacorder''' is a theoretical device described in the 2003 short story of the same name by Tristan Parker. As the story describes, the Metacorder is a computational device which does nothing other than monitoring its own activities. While in practice this would result in an [[Infinite loop|endless loop]] similar to the print "print" [[Quine (computing)|quine]], the story takes this idea and gives it a sort of intelligence which allows the Metacorder to consider and judge its own actions.

This is an example of [[constrained writing]], both in that the story describes a single object over the course of several pages, and that it is done entirely in the voice of such an object being described. This double rule allows much playfulness, however, and the story ranges from realistic technical descriptions to vague, poetic musings while still keeping the same voice throughout.

'''Mouse hepatitis virus''' is a [[virus]] of the family ''[[Coronaviridae]]'', genus [[coronavirus|''Betacoronavirus'']].

The ''Murine coronavirus'', Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), is a coronavirus that causes an epidemic [[murine]] illness with high mortality, especially among colonies of laboratory mice. Prior to the discovery of SARS-CoV, MHV had been the best-studied coronavirus both ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro'' as well as at the molecular level. Some strains of MHV cause a progressive demyelinating encephalitis in mice which has been used as a murine model for [[multiple sclerosis]]. Significant research efforts have been focused on elucidating the [[viral pathogenesis]] of these animal coronaviruses, especially by [[virologist]]s interested in veterinary and [[zoonotic]] diseases.

'''Newton's laws of motion''' are three [[physical law]]s that, together, laid the foundation for [[classical mechanics]]. They describe the relationship between a body and the [[force]]s acting upon it, and its [[motion (physics)|motion]] in response to those forces. More precisely, the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative measure of the force, and the third asserts that a single isolated force doesn't exist. These three laws have been expressed in several ways, over nearly three centuries,&lt;ref&gt;For explanations of Newton's laws of motion by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] in the early 18th century, by the physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] in the mid-19th century, and by a modern text of the early 21st century, see:-

The three laws of motion were first compiled by [[Isaac Newton]] in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (''Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy''), first published in 1687.&lt;ref name=Principia&gt;See the ''Principia'' on line at [https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich Andrew Motte Translation]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems.&lt;ref name=Motte&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/~gravitee/axioms.htm Andrew Motte translation of Newton's ''Principia'' (1687) ''Axioms or Laws of Motion'']&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the third volume of the text, Newton showed that these laws of motion, combined with his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], explained [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].

A '''fourth law''' is often also described in the bibliography, which states that forces add up like vectors, that is, that forces obey the [[Superposition principle|principle of superposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greiner|first1=Walter|title=Classical mechanics: point particles and relativity|date=2003|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-21851-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeidler|first1=E.|title=Nonlinear Functional Analysis and its Applications IV: Applications to Mathematical Physics|date=1988|publisher=Springer New York|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4612-4566-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wachter|first1=Armin|last2=Hoeber|first2=Henning|title=Compendium of theoretical physics|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-387-25799-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|150px|Isaac Newton (1643–1727), the physicist who formulated the laws]]
Newton's laws are applied to objects which are idealised as single point masses,&lt;ref&gt;''[...]while Newton had used the word 'body' vaguely and in at least three different meanings, Euler realized that the statements of Newton are generally correct only when applied to masses concentrated at isolated points;''{{Cite book| last1 = Truesdell | first1 = Clifford A.| last2 = Becchi| first2 = Antonio| last3 = Benvenuto| first3 = Edoardo| title = Essays on the history of mechanics: in memory of Clifford Ambrose Truesdell and Edoardo Benvenuto| publisher = Birkhäuser| date = 2003| location = New York| page = 207| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6LO_U6T-HvsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=essays+in+the+History&amp;cd=9#v=snippet&amp;q=%22isolated%20points%22| isbn = 3-7643-1476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense that the size and shape of the object's body are neglected to focus on its motion more easily. This can be done when the object is small compared to the distances involved in its analysis, or the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] and rotation of the body are of no importance. In this way, even a planet can be idealised as a particle for analysis of its orbital motion around a star.

In their original form, Newton's laws of motion are not adequate to characterise the motion of [[rigid bodies]] and [[deformable bodies]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1750 introduced a generalisation of Newton's laws of motion for rigid bodies called [[Euler's laws of motion]], later applied as well for deformable bodies assumed as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]]. If a body is represented as an assemblage of discrete particles, each governed by Newton's laws of motion, then Euler's laws can be derived from Newton's laws. Euler's laws can, however, be taken as axioms describing the laws of motion for extended bodies, independently of any particle structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lubliner |first=Jacob |title=Plasticity Theory (Revised Edition) |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2008 |url=http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~coby/plas/pdf/book.pdf |isbn=0-486-46290-0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331022415/http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~coby/plas/pdf/book.pdf |archivedate=31 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's laws hold only with respect to a certain set of [[frames of reference]] called [[Inertial reference frame|Newtonian or inertial reference frames]]. Some authors interpret the first law as defining what an inertial reference frame is; from this point of view, the second law holds only when the observation is made from an inertial reference frame, and therefore the first law cannot be proved as a special case of the second. Other authors do treat the first law as a corollary of the second.&lt;ref name=tseitlin&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/j42866672t863506/ |title= Newton's First Law: Text, Translations, Interpretations and Physics Education |journal= Science &amp; Education | author= Galili, I. | author2= Tseitlin, M. |volume= 12 |issue= 1 |year= 2003 |pages= 45–73 |doi= 10.1023/A:1022632600805 |bibcode = 2003Sc&amp;Ed..12...45G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/1np/ch04/ch04.html |title= Newtonian Physics |author= Benjamin Crowell |chapter= 4.

In the given interpretation [[mass]], [[acceleration]], [[momentum]], and (most importantly) [[force]] are assumed to be externally defined quantities. This is the most common, but not the only interpretation of the way one can consider the laws to be a definition of these quantities.

Newtonian mechanics has been superseded by [[special relativity]], but it is still useful as an approximation when the speeds involved are much slower than the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;In making a modern adjustment of the second law for (some of) the effects of relativity, ''m'' would be treated as the [[relativistic mass]], producing the relativistic expression for momentum, and the third law might be modified if possible to allow for the finite signal propagation speed between distant interacting particles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==
===Newton's first law===
{{Main|Inertia}}

The first law states that if the [[net force]] (the [[vector sum]] of all forces acting on an object) is zero, then the [[velocity]] of the object is constant. Velocity is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity which expresses both the object's [[speed]] and the direction of its motion; therefore, the statement that the object's velocity is constant is a statement that both its speed and the direction of its motion are constant.

The first law can be stated mathematically when the mass is a non-zero constant, as,
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum \mathbf{F} = 0\; \Leftrightarrow\; \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{v} }{\mathrm{d}t} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently,
* An object that is at rest will stay at rest unless a force acts upon it.
* An object that is in motion will not change its velocity unless a force acts upon it.

This is known as ''uniform motion''. An object ''continues'' to do whatever it happens to be doing unless a force is exerted upon it. If it is at rest, it continues in a state of rest (demonstrated when a tablecloth is skilfully whipped from under dishes on a tabletop and the dishes remain in their initial state of rest). If an object is moving, it continues to move without turning or changing its speed. This is evident in space probes that continuously move in outer space. Changes in motion must be imposed against the tendency of an object to retain its state of motion. In the absence of net forces, a moving object tends to move along a straight line path indefinitely.

Newton placed the first law of motion to establish [[frames of reference]] for which the other laws are applicable. The first law of motion postulates the existence of at least one [[frame of reference]] called a Newtonian or [[inertial reference frame]], relative to which the motion of a particle not subject to forces is a straight line at a constant speed.&lt;ref name=tseitlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodhouse&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ggPXQAeeRLgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn=1852334266#PPA6,M1 |title=Special relativity |page=6 |author=NMJ Woodhouse |publisher=Springer |date=2003 |isbn=1-85233-426-6 |location=London/Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's first law is often referred to as the ''[[Inertia|law of inertia]]''. Thus, a condition necessary for the uniform motion of a particle relative to an inertial reference frame is that the total net [[force]] acting on it is zero. In this sense, the first law can be restated as:

{{quote|''In every material universe, the motion of a particle in a preferential reference frame Φ is determined by the action of forces whose total vanished for all times when and only when the velocity of the particle is constant in Φ. That is, a particle initially at rest or in uniform motion in the preferential frame Φ continues in that state unless compelled by forces to change it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beatty, Millard F.|date=2006|title=Principles of engineering mechanics Volume 2 of Principles of Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics-The Analysis of Motion, |page=24| publisher =Springer|isbn=0-387-23704-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wr2QOBqOBakC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Newton's first and second laws are valid only in an inertial reference frame. Any reference frame that is in uniform motion with respect to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame, i.e. [[Galilean invariance]] or the [[principle of relativity|principle of Newtonian relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thornton, Marion|date=2004|title=Classical dynamics of particles and systems|page=53| publisher = Brooks/Cole| edition=5th|

===Newton's second law=== &lt;!-- [Newton's second law] --&gt;

The second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}(m\mathbf v)}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;
The second law can also be stated in terms of an object's acceleration. Since Newton's second law is valid only for constant-mass systems,&lt;ref name="plastino"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plastino|first=Angel R. |author2=Muzzio, Juan C.|year=1992|title=On the use and abuse of Newton's second law for variable mass problems|journal=Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Netherlands|volume= 53|issue= 3|pages=227–232|issn=0923-2958|bibcode=1992CeMDA..53..227P|doi=10.1007/BF00052611}} "We may conclude emphasizing that Newton's second law is valid for constant mass only.

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} = m\mathbf{a},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''F''' is the net force applied, ''m'' is the mass of the body, and '''a''' is the body's acceleration. Thus, the net force applied to a body produces a proportional acceleration. In other words, if a body is accelerating, then there is a force on it. An application of this notation is the derivation of [[G Subscript C]].

Consistent with the [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|first law]], the time derivative of the momentum is non-zero when the momentum changes direction, even if there is no change in its magnitude; such is the case with [[uniform circular motion]]. The relationship also implies the [[conservation of momentum]]: when the net force on the body is zero, the momentum of the body is constant. Any net force is equal to the rate of change of the momentum.

Any mass that is gained or lost by the system will cause a change in momentum that is not the result of an external force. A different equation is necessary for variable-mass systems (see [[#Variable-mass_systems|below]]).

Newton's second law is an approximation that is increasingly worse at high speeds because of [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects.

====Impulse====
An [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]] '''J''' occurs when a force '''F''' acts over an interval of time Δ''t'', and it is given by&lt;ref&gt;Hannah, J, Hillier, M J, ''Applied Mechanics'', p221, Pitman Paperbacks, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Serway&gt;{{cite book |title=College Physics |page=161 |author=Raymond A.

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} = \int_{\Delta t} \mathbf F \,\mathrm{d}t .&lt;/math&gt;
Since force is the time derivative of momentum, it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \Delta\mathbf{p} = m\Delta\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;
This relation between impulse and momentum is closer to Newton's wording of the second law.&lt;ref name=Harman&gt;{{cite book |title=The investigation of difficult things: essays on Newton and the history of the exact sciences in honour of D.T.

====Variable-mass systems====
{{main|Variable-mass system}}
Variable-mass systems, like a rocket burning fuel and ejecting spent gases, are not [[closed system|closed]] and cannot be directly treated by making mass a function of time in the second law;&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt; that is, the following formula is wrong:&lt;ref name="Kleppner"/&gt;
&lt;!-- If you have the Halliday book, please add the missing fields of the Cite book template. While you're at it, update the same citation found in [[Force]].--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{net} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\big[m(t)\mathbf{v}(t)\big] = m(t) \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} + \mathbf{v}(t) \frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}. \qquad \mathrm{(wrong)}&lt;/math&gt;
The falsehood of this formula can be seen by noting that it does not respect [[Galilean invariance]]: a variable-mass object with '''F'''&amp;nbsp;= 0 in one frame will be seen to have '''F'''&amp;nbsp;≠ 0 in another frame.&lt;ref name="plastino" /&gt;
The correct equation of motion for a body whose mass ''m'' varies with time by either ejecting or accreting mass is obtained by applying the second law to the entire, constant-mass system consisting of the body and its ejected/accreted mass; the result is&lt;ref name="plastino"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F + \mathbf{u} \frac{\mathrm{d} m}{\mathrm{d}t} = m {\mathrm{d} \mathbf v \over \mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' is the velocity of the escaping or incoming mass relative to the body. From this equation one can derive the equation of motion for a varying mass system, for example, the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]].
Under some conventions, the quantity '''u'''&amp;thinsp;d''m''/d''t'' on the left-hand side, which represents the [[advection]] of [[momentum]], is defined as a force (the force exerted on the body by the changing mass, such as rocket exhaust) and is included in the quantity '''F'''. Then, by substituting the definition of acceleration, the equation becomes '''F'''&amp;nbsp;= ''m'''''a'''.

===Newton's third law===
[[File:Skaters showing newtons third law.svg|thumb|right|250px|An illustration of Newton's third law in which two skaters push against each other. The first skater on the left exerts a normal force N&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; on the second skater directed towards the right, and the second skater exerts a normal force N&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; on the first skater directed towards the left. &lt;br/&gt;The magnitudes of both forces are equal, but they have opposite directions, as dictated by Newton's third law.]]

The third law states that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction: if one object ''A'' exerts a force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; on a second object ''B'', then ''B'' simultaneously exerts a force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''A'', and the two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = −'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="resnick83"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Resnick|last2=Halliday|last3=Krane|title=Physics, Volume 1|edition=4th|page=83|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third law means that all forces are ''[[interaction]]s'' between different bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In some situations, the magnitude and direction of the forces are determined entirely by one of the two bodies, say Body ''A''; the force exerted by Body ''A'' on Body ''B'' is called the "action", and the force exerted by Body ''B'' on Body ''A'' is called the "reaction". This law is sometimes referred to as the ''[[Reaction (physics)|action-reaction law]]'', with '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; called the "action" and '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; the "reaction". In other situations the magnitude and directions of the forces are determined jointly by both bodies and it isn't necessary to identify one force as the "action" and the other as the "reaction". The action and the reaction are simultaneous, and it does not matter which is called the ''action'' and which is called ''reaction''; both forces are part of a single interaction, and neither force exists without the other.&lt;ref name="resnick83" /&gt;

The two forces in Newton's third law are of the same type (e.g., if the road exerts a forward frictional force on an accelerating car's tires, then it is also a frictional force that Newton's third law predicts for the tires pushing backward on the road).

From a conceptual standpoint, Newton's third law is seen when a person walks: they push against the floor, and the floor pushes against the person. Similarly, the tires of a car push against the road while the road pushes back on the tires—the tires and road simultaneously push against each other. In swimming, a person interacts with the water, pushing the water backward, while the water simultaneously pushes the person forward—both the person and the water push against each other. The reaction forces account for the motion in these examples. These forces depend on friction; a person or car on ice, for example, may be unable to exert the action force to produce the needed reaction force.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt (2006), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Newtons laws in latin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Newton's First and Second laws, in Latin, from the original 1687 ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'']]
===Newton's 1st Law===
From the original [[Latin]] of Newton's ''Principia'':
{{Cquote|''Lex I: Corpus omne perseverare in statu suo quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter in directum, nisi quatenus a viribus impressis cogitur statum illum mutare.''}}

Translated to English, this reads:
{{Cquote|Law I: Every body persists in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton, ''The Principia'', A new translation by I.B. Cohen and A. Whitman, University of California press, Berkeley 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] had the view that all objects have a natural place in the universe: that heavy objects (such as rocks) wanted to be at rest on the Earth and that light objects like smoke wanted to be at rest in the sky and the stars wanted to remain in the heavens. He thought that a body was in its natural state when it was at rest, and for the body to move in a straight line at a constant speed an external agent was needed continually to propel it, otherwise it would stop moving. [[Galileo Galilei]], however, realised that a force is necessary to change the velocity of a body, i.e., acceleration, but no force is needed to maintain its velocity. In other words, Galileo stated that, in the ''absence'' of a force, a moving object will continue moving. (The tendency of objects to resist changes in motion was what [[Johannes Kepler]] had called ''inertia''.) This insight was refined by Newton, who made it into his first law, also known as the "law of inertia"—no force means no acceleration, and hence the body will maintain its velocity. As Newton's first law is a restatement of the law of inertia which Galileo had already described, Newton appropriately gave credit to Galileo.

The law of inertia apparently occurred to several different natural philosophers and scientists independently, including [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes wrote in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'': {{quote|style=margin-top: -0.5em; padding-left: 0.5em;|That when a thing lies still, unless somewhat else stir it, it will lie still forever, is a truth that no man doubts. But [the proposition] that when a thing is in motion it will eternally be in motion unless somewhat else stay it, though the reason be the same (namely that nothing can change itself), is not so easily assented to. For men measure not only other men but all other things by themselves. And because they find themselves subject after motion to pain and lassitude, [they] think every thing else grows weary of motion and seeks repose of its own accord, little considering whether it be not some other motion wherein that desire of rest they find in themselves, consists.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th-century philosopher and mathematician [[René Descartes]] also formulated the law, although he did not perform any experiments to confirm it.&lt;ref name="cohen117"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=I.

===Newton's 2nd Law===
Newton's original Latin reads:
{{Cquote|''Lex II: Mutationem motus proportionalem esse vi motrici impressae, et fieri secundum lineam rectam qua vis illa imprimitur''.}}

This was translated quite closely in Motte's 1729 translation as:

{{Cquote|Law II: The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impress'd; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impress'd.}}

According to modern ideas of how Newton was using his terminology,&lt;ref&gt;According to Maxwell in ''Matter and Motion'', Newton meant by ''motion'' "''the quantity of matter moved as well as the rate at which it travels" and by ''impressed force'' he meant "the time during which the force acts as well as the intensity of the force''". See Harman and Shapiro, cited below.&lt;/ref&gt; this is understood, in modern terms, as an equivalent of:
''{{quote|The change of momentum of a body is proportional to the impulse impressed on the body, and happens along the straight line on which that impulse is impressed.}}''
This may be expressed by the formula F = p', where p' is the time derivative of the momentum p. This equation can be seen clearly in the [[Wren Library]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in a glass case in which Newton's manuscript is open to the relevant page.

Motte's 1729 translation of Newton's Latin continued with Newton's commentary on the second law of motion, reading:
''{{quote|If a force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subtracted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.}}''

The sense or senses in which Newton used his terminology, and how he understood the second law and intended it to be understood, have been extensively discussed by historians of science, along with the relations between Newton's formulation and modern formulations.&lt;ref&gt;See for example (1) I Bernard Cohen, "Newton's Second Law and the Concept of Force in the Principia", in "The Annus Mirabilis of Sir Isaac Newton 1666–1966" (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1967), pages 143–185; (2) Stuart Pierson, "'Corpore cadente. . .': Historians Discuss Newton’s Second Law", Perspectives on Science, 1 (1993), pages 627–658; and (3) Bruce Pourciau, "Newton's Interpretation of Newton's Second Law", Archive for History of Exact Sciences, vol.60 (2006), pages 157–207; also an online discussion by G E Smith, in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-principia/index.html#NewLawMot 5. Newton's Laws of Motion], s.5 of "Newton's ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica''" in (online) ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newton's 3rd Law===
{{Cquote|''Lex III: Actioni contrariam semper et æqualem esse reactionem: sive corporum duorum actiones in se mutuo semper esse æquales et in partes contrarias dirigi.''}}

Translated to English, this reads:

{{Cquote|Law III: To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.}}
Newton's [[Scholium]] (explanatory comment) to this law:
{{quote|Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that other. If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone. If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the horse (if I may so say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone: for the distended rope, by the same endeavour to relax or unbend itself, will draw the horse as much towards the stone, as it does the stone towards the horse, and will obstruct the progress of the one as much as it advances that of the other. If a body impinges upon another, and by its force changes the motion of the other, that body also (because of the equality of the mutual pressure) will undergo an equal change, in its own motion, toward the contrary part. The changes made by these actions are equal, not in the velocities but in the motions of the bodies; that is to say, if the bodies are not hindered by any other impediments. For, as the motions are equally changed, the changes of the velocities made toward contrary parts are reciprocally proportional to the bodies. This law takes place also in attractions, as will be proved in the next scholium.&lt;ref&gt;This translation of the third law and the commentary following it can be found in the ''[[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|Principia]]'' on [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false page 20 of volume 1 of the 1729 translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425035710/https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 |date=25 April 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the above, as usual, ''motion'' is Newton's name for momentum, hence his careful distinction between motion and velocity.

Newton used the third law to derive the law of [[momentum#Conservation|conservation of momentum]];&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Principia'', Corollary III to the laws of motion&lt;/ref&gt; from a deeper perspective, however, conservation of momentum is the more fundamental idea (derived via [[Noether's theorem]] from [[Galilean invariance]]), and holds in cases where Newton's third law appears to fail, for instance when [[force field (physics)|force fields]] as well as particles carry momentum, and in [[quantum mechanics]]. &lt;!-- In force fields I do not think the violation is a necessity; we could easily remodel the fields perhaps as interaction between particles at the quantum level and still have the 3rd law holding. I think the 3rd law breakdown is just a consequence of the model used --&gt;

==Importance and range of validity==
Newton's laws were verified by experiment and observation for over 200 years, and they are excellent approximations at the scales and speeds of everyday life. Newton's laws of motion, together with his law of [[universal gravitation]] and the mathematical techniques of [[calculus]], provided for the first time a unified quantitative explanation for a wide range of physical phenomena.

These three laws hold to a good approximation for macroscopic objects under everyday conditions. However, Newton's laws (combined with universal gravitation and [[classical electrodynamics]]) are inappropriate for use in certain circumstances, most notably at very small scales, very high speeds (in [[special relativity]], the [[Lorentz factor]] must be included in the expression for momentum along with the [[rest mass]] and velocity) or very strong gravitational fields. Therefore, the laws cannot be used to explain phenomena such as conduction of electricity in a [[semiconductor]], optical properties of substances, errors in non-relativistically corrected [[GPS]] systems and [[superconductivity]]. Explanation of these phenomena requires more sophisticated physical theories, including [[general relativity]] and [[quantum field theory]].

In [[quantum mechanics]], concepts such as force, momentum, and position are defined by linear [[Operator (physics)|operators]] that operate on the [[quantum state]]; at speeds that are much lower than the speed of light, Newton's laws are just as exact for these operators as they are for classical objects. At speeds comparable to the speed of light, the second law holds in the original form '''F'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;d'''p'''/d''t'', where '''F''' and '''p''' are [[four-vector]]s.

==Relationship to the conservation laws==
In modern physics, the [[Conservation law (physics)|laws of conservation]] of [[momentum]], energy, and [[angular momentum]] are of more general validity than Newton's laws, since they apply to both light and matter, and to both classical and non-classical physics.

This can be stated simply, "Momentum, energy and angular momentum cannot be created or destroyed."

Because force is the time derivative of momentum, the concept of force is redundant and subordinate to the conservation of momentum, and is not used in fundamental theories (e.g., [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum electrodynamics]], [[general relativity]], etc.). The [[standard model]] explains in detail how the three fundamental forces known as [[Gauge theory|gauge forces]] originate out of exchange by [[virtual particles]]. Other forces, such as [[Gravitation|gravity]] and [[Pauli exclusion principle#Consequences|fermionic degeneracy pressure]], also arise from the momentum conservation. Indeed, the conservation of [[4-momentum]] in inertial motion via [[curved space-time]] results in what we call [[gravitational force]] in [[general relativity]] theory. The application of the space derivative (which is a [[momentum operator]] in quantum mechanics) to the overlapping [[wave functions]] of a pair of [[fermion]]s (particles with half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) results in shifts of maxima of compound wavefunction away from each other, which is observable as the "repulsion" of the fermions.

Newton stated the third law within a world-view that assumed instantaneous action at a distance between material particles. However, he was prepared for philosophical criticism of this [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]], and it was in this context that he stated the famous phrase "[[Hypotheses non fingo|I feign no hypotheses]]". In modern physics, action at a distance has been completely eliminated, except for subtle effects involving [[quantum entanglement]]. (In particular, this refers to [[Bell's theorem]] – that no [[local hidden variable theory|local model]] can reproduce the predictions of quantum theory.) Despite only being an approximation, in modern engineering and all practical applications involving the motion of vehicles and satellites, the concept of action at a distance is used extensively.

The discovery of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]] in the 19th century showed that not every physical quantity is conserved over time, thus disproving the validity of inducing the opposite metaphysical view from Newton's laws. Hence, a "steady-state" worldview based solely on Newton's laws and the conservation laws does not take [[entropy]] into account.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="803">In [[economics]], the theory of '''rational inattention''' deals with the effects of the cost of information acquisition on decision making. For example, when the information required for a decision is costly to acquire, the decision makers may rationally take decisions based on incomplete information, rather than incurring the cost to get the complete information.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, C.A., 2003. Implications of rational inattention. Journal of monetary Economics, 50(3), pp.665-690.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sims, C.A., 2010. Rational inattention and monetary economics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11333">A '''runoff model''' is  a mathematical model describing the [[rainfall]]'''&amp;ndash;'''[[Surface runoff|runoff]] relations of a rainfall ''catchment area'', [[drainage basin]] or ''watershed''. More precisely, it produces a surface runoff [[hydrograph]] in response to a rainfall event, represented by and input as a [[hyetograph]]. In other words, the model calculates the conversion of rainfall into runoff.&lt;br&gt;
A well known runoff model is the ''linear reservoir'', but in practice it has limited applicability.&lt;br&gt;
The runoff model with a ''non-linear reservoir'' is more universally applicable, but still it holds only for catchments whose surface area is limited by the condition that the rainfall can be considered more or less uniformly distributed over the area. The maximum size of the watershed then depends on the rainfall characteristics of the region.  When the study area is too large, it can be divided into sub-catchments and the various runoff hydrographs may be combined using [[Routing (hydrology)|flood routing]] techniques.&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Water cycle.png|thumb|300px]]
Rainfall-runoff models need to be [[calibration|calibrated]] before they can be used.

==Linear reservoir==
[[File:Drainage_basin.png|thumb|200px|A watershed or drainage basin]]
[[File:LinReserv.svg|thumb|150px|Figure 1. A linear reservoir]]
The hydrology of a linear reservoir (figure 1) is governed by two equations.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. de Zeeuw, 1973. ''Hydrograph analysis for areas with mainly groundwater runoff''. In: Drainage Principle and Applications, Vol. II, Chapter 16, Theories of field drainage and watershed runoff. p 321-358. Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;
#flow equation''':''' &amp;nbsp; Q = A.S, with units [L/T], where L is length (e.g. mm) and T is time (e.g. h, day)
#continuity or water balance equation''':''' &amp;nbsp; R = Q + dS/dT, with units [L/T]
where:&lt;br&gt;
Q is the ''runoff'' or'' discharge'' &lt;br&gt;
R is the ''effective rainfall'' or ''rainfall excess'' or ''recharge'' &lt;br&gt;
A is the constant ''reaction factor'' or ''response factor'' with unit [1/T] &lt;br&gt;
S is the water storage with unit [L] &lt;br&gt;
dS is a differential or small increment of S&lt;br&gt; 
dT is a differential or small increment of T

'''Runoff equation'''&lt;br&gt;
A combination of the two previous equations results in a [[differential equation]], whose solution is:
* Q2 = Q1 exp { &amp;minus;A (T2 &amp;minus; T1) } + R [ 1 &amp;minus; exp '''{''' &amp;minus;A (T2 &amp;minus; T1) '''}''' ]
This is the ''runoff equation'' or ''discharge equation'', where Q1 and Q2 are the values of Q at time T1 and T2 respectively while T2&amp;minus;T1 is a small time step during which the recharge can be assumed constant.

'''Computing the total hydrograph'''&lt;br&gt;
Provided the value of A is known, the ''total hydrograph'' can be obtained using a successive number of time steps and computing, with the ''runoff equation'', the runoff at the end of each time step from the runoff at the end of the previous time step.

'''Unit hydrograph'''&lt;br&gt;
The discharge may also be expressed as: Q = &amp;minus; dS/dT . Substituting herein the expression of Q in equation (1) gives the differential equation dS/dT = A.S, of which the solution is: S = exp(&amp;minus; A.t) . Replacing herein S by Q/A according to equation (1), it is obtained that: Q = A exp(&amp;minus; A.t) . This is called the [[hydrograph|instantaneous unit hydrograph]] (IUH) because the Q herein equals Q2 of the foregoing runoff equation using ''R'' = 0, and taking S as ''unity'' which makes Q1 equal to A according to equation (1).&lt;br&gt;
The availability of the foregoing ''runoff equation'' eliminates the necessity of calculating the ''total hydrograph'' by the summation of partial hydrographs using the ''IUH'' as is done with the more complicated [[convolution]] method.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Kraijenhoff van de Leur, 1973. ''Rainfall-runoff relations and computational models''. In: Drainage Principle and Applications, Vol. II, Chapter 16, Theories of field drainage and watershed runoff. p 245-320. Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Determining the response factor A'''&lt;br&gt;
When the ''response factor'' A can be determined from the characteristics of the watershed (catchment area), the reservoir can be used as a ''deterministic model'' or ''analytical model'', see [[hydrological modelling]].&lt;br&gt;
Otherwise, the factor A can be determined from a data record of rainfall and runoff using the method explained below under ''non-linear reservoir''. With this method  the reservoir can be used as a [[black box]] model.

'''Conversions'''&lt;br&gt;
1&amp;nbsp;mm/day corresponds to 10&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day per ha of the watershed&lt;br&gt;
1&amp;nbsp;l/s per ha corresponds to 8.64&amp;nbsp;mm/day or 86.4&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day per ha

==Non-linear reservoir==
[[File:NonLinRes.svg|left|thumb|200px|Figure 2. A non-linear reservoir]]
{{stack|clear=true|
[[File:Reaction_factor.png|thumb|Figure 3. The reaction factor (Aq, Alpha) versus discharge (Q) for a small valley (Rogbom) in Sierra Leone]]
[[File:Rainfall runoff relation simulated by non-linear resrvoir model.png|thumb|Figure 4. Actual and simulated discharge, Rogbom valley]][[File:Rogbom3 recharge.png|thumb|Figure 5. Rainfall and recharge, Rogbom valley]]
[[File:ReservoirDiagram.jpg|thumb|Figure 6. Non-linear reservoir with pre-reservoir for recharge]]
}}

Contrary to the linear reservoir, the non linear reservoir has a reaction factor A that is not a constant,&lt;ref&gt;''Land drainage and soil salinity: some Mexican experiences''. In: ILRI Annual Report 1995, p. 44-53. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen (ILRI), The Netherlands. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/mexican.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; but it is a function of S or Q (figure 2, 3).

Normally A increases with Q and S because the higher the water level is the higher the discharge capacity becomes. The factor is therefore called Aq instead of A.&lt;br&gt;
The non-linear reservoir has ''no'' usable [[unit hydrograph]].

During periods without rainfall or recharge, i.e. when ''R'' = 0, the runoff equation reduces to
* Q2 = Q1 exp { &amp;minus; Aq (T2 &amp;minus; T1) }, or:
or, using a ''unit time step'' (T2 &amp;minus; T1 = 1) and solving for Aq:
* Aq = &amp;minus; ln (Q2/Q1)
Hence, the reaction or response factor Aq can be determined from runoff or discharge measurements using ''unit time steps'' during dry spells, employing a [[numerical method]].

Figure 3 shows the relation between Aq (Alpha) and Q for a small valley (Rogbom) in Sierra Leone.&lt;br&gt;
Figure 4 shows observed and ''simulated'' or ''reconstructed'' discharge [[hydrograph]] of the watercourse at the downstream end of the same valley.&lt;ref&gt;A.Huizing, 1988. ''Rainfall-Runoff relations in a small cultivated valley in Sierra Leone''. Wetland Utilization Research Project. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recharge==
[[File:Surface water cycle.svg|thumb|200px|left|Figure 7. Runoff from the water balance]]
The recharge, also called ''effective rainfall'' or ''rainfall excess'', can be modeled by a ''pre-reservoir'' (figure 6) giving the recharge as ''overflow''. The pre-reservoir knows the following elements:
*a maximum storage (Sm) with unit length [L]
*an actual storage (Sa) with unit [L]
*a relative storage: Sr = Sa/Sm
*a maximum escape rate (Em) with units length/time [L/T]. It corresponds to the maximum rate of [[evapotranspiration|evaporation]] plus ''percolation'' and [[groundwater recharge]], which will not take part in the runoff process (figure 5, 6)
*an actual escape rate: Ea = Sr.Em
*a  storage deficiency: Sd = Sm + Ea &amp;minus; Sa

The recharge during a unit time step (T2&amp;minus;T1=1) can be found from ''R'' = Rain &amp;minus; Sd&lt;br&gt;
The actual storage at the end of a ''unit time step'' is found as Sa2 = Sa1 + Rain &amp;minus; ''R'' &amp;minus; Ea, where Sa1 is the actual storage at the start of the time step.

The [[runoff curve number|Curve Number method]] (CN method) gives another way to calculate the recharge. The ''initial abstraction'' herein compares with Sm &amp;minus; Si, where Si is the initial value of Sa.

==Nash model==
[[File:Tank Model.jpg|thumb|The Nash Model uses a cascade of linear reservoirs to predict streamflow. Software for this model exists.&lt;ref&gt;Software description for the Nash cascade hydrological model. On line: [https://www.waterlog.info/nashmod.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Nash model &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental and Hydrological Systems Modelling|last=Jayawardena|first=A. W.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-46532-8|location=US|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses a series (cascade) of linear reservoirs in which each reservoir empties into the next until the runoff is obtained. For [[calibration]], the model requires considerable research.

==Software==
Figures 3 and 4 were made with the RainOff program,&lt;ref&gt;''RainOff'', a computer model for rainfall-runoff relations using the concept of a non-linear reservoir. Download from : [http://www.waterlog.info/software.htm] , or from : [https://www.waterlog.info/rainoff.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; designed to analyse rainfall and runoff using the non-linear reservoir model with a pre-reservoir. The program also contains an example of the hydrograph of an agricultural subsurface drainage system for which the value of A can be obtained from the system's characteristics.&lt;ref&gt; Theory of the non-linear reservoir [https://www.waterlog.info/pdf/reservoir.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The SMART hydrological model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mockler|first=Eva M.|last2=O’Loughlin|first2=Fiachra E.|last3=Bruen|first3=Michael|date=2016-05-01|title=Understanding hydrological flow paths in conceptual catchment models using uncertainty and sensitivity analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009830041530039X|journal=Computers &amp; Geosciences|series=Uncertainty and Sensitivity in Surface Dynamics Modeling|volume=90, Part B|pages=66–77|doi=10.1016/j.cageo.2015.08.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes agricultural subsurface drainage flow, in addition to soil and groundwater reservoirs, to simulate the flow path contributions to streamflow.

[[Vflo|V''flo'']] is another software program for modeling runoff.  [[Vflo|V''flo'']] uses [[Weather radar|radar rainfall]] and [[GIS]] data to generate physics-based, distributed runoff simulation.

The [[WEAP|WEAP (Water Evaluation And Planning)]] software platform models runoff and percolation from climate and land use data, using a choice of linear and non-linear reservoir models.

The [http://rsminerve.hydro10.org/ RS MINERVE] software platform simulates the formation of free surface run-off flow and its propagation in rivers or channels. The software is based on object-oriented programming and allows hydrologic and hydraulic modeling according to a semi-distributed conceptual scheme with different rainfall-runoff model such as HBV, GR4J, SAC-SMA or SOCONT.

'''SNOMED CT'''{{efn|The [[International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation]] considers SNOMED CT to be a [[brand]] name rather than an [[acronym]]. Previously SNOMED was an acronym for '''S'''ystematized '''No'''menclature Of '''Med'''icine, but it lost that meaning when SNOMED was combined with CTV3 (Clinical Terms Version 3) into the merged product called SNOMED Clinical Terms, which was shortened to SNOMED CT.&lt;ref name="ihtsdo-history" /&gt;}} or '''SNOMED Clinical Terms''' is a systematically organized computer processable collection of [[medical terms]] providing codes, terms, synonyms and definitions used in clinical documentation and reporting. SNOMED CT is considered to be the most comprehensive, multilingual clinical healthcare terminology in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of Health Interoperability HL7 and SNOMED|last = Benson|first = Tim|publisher = Springer|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-4471-2800-7|location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medical-terms.html&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of SNOMED CT is to encode the meanings that are used in health information and to support the effective clinical recording of data with the aim of improving patient care. SNOMED CT provides the core general terminology for [[electronic health record]]s. SNOMED CT comprehensive coverage includes: clinical findings, symptoms, diagnoses, procedures, body structures, organisms and other etiologies, substances, pharmaceuticals, devices and specimens.

SNOMED CT is maintained and distributed by SNOMED International, an international non-profit standards development organization, located in London, UK. SNOMED International is the trading name of the [[International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation]] (IHTSDO), established in 2007.

SNOMED CT provides for consistent information interchange and is fundamental to an interoperable electronic health record. It provides a consistent means to index, store, retrieve, and aggregate clinical data across specialties and sites of care. It also helps in organizing the content of electronic health records systems by reducing the variability in the way data are captured, encoded and used for clinical care of patients and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruch |first1=Patrick |last2=Gobeill |first2=Julien |last3=Lovis |first3=Christian |last4=Geissbühler |first4=Antoine |title=Automatic medical encoding with SNOMED categories |journal=BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making |volume=8 |pages=S6 |year=2008 |pmid=19007443 |pmc=2582793 |doi=10.1186/1472-6947-8-S1-S6}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNOMED CT can be used to directly record clinical details of individuals in electronic patient records. It also provides the user with a number of linkages to clinical care pathways, shared care plans and other knowledge resources, in order to facilitate informed decision-making, and to support long-term patient care. The availability of free automatic coding tools and services, which can return a ranked list of SNOMED CT descriptors to encode any clinical report, could help healthcare professionals to navigate the terminology.

SNOMED CT is a terminology that can cross-map to other international standards and classifications.&lt;ref name="ihtsdo-mapping"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/mapping-to-other-terminologies |title=SNOMED CT &amp; Other Terminologies, Classifications &amp; Code Systems |publisher=International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific language editions are available which augment the international edition and can contain language translations, as well as additional national terms. For example, SNOMED CT-AU, released in December 2009 in Australia, is based on the international version of SNOMED CT, but encompasses words and ideas that are clinically and technically unique to Australia.&lt;ref name="nehta.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nehta.gov.au/our-work/clinical-terminology/snomed-clinical-terms | title=Our Work: Clinical Terminology: SNOMED-CT-AU |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[SNOMED]] was started in 1965 as a Systematized Nomenclature of Pathology (SNOP) and was further developed into a logic-based health care terminology.&lt;ref name="ihtsdo-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/what-is-snomed-ct/history-of-snomed-ct |title=History Of SNOMED CT |publisher=International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cornet|first1=Ronald |last2=de Keizer |first2=Nicolette |title=Forty years of SNOMED: a literature review |journal=BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making |volume=8 |pages=S2 |year=2008 |pmid=19007439 |doi=10.1186/1472-6947-8-S1-S2 |pmc=2582789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SNOMED CT was created in 1999 by the merger, expansion and restructuring of two large-scale terminologies: SNOMED Reference Terminology (SNOMED RT), developed by the [[College of American Pathologists]] (CAP); and the Clinical Terms Version 3 (CTV3) (formerly known as the [[Read codes]]), developed by the [[National Health Service]] of the United Kingdom (NHS).&lt;ref name="NLM-UMLS-add"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_announcement.html |title=SNOMED Clinical Terms To Be Added To UMLS Metathesaurus |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |date=24 May 2006 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NLM-SNOMED-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_faq.html |title=FAQs: SNOMED CT in the UMLS |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final product was released in January 2002.

The historical strength of SNOMED was its coverage of medical specialties. SNOMED RT, with over 120,000 concepts, was designed to serve as a common reference terminology for the aggregation and retrieval of pathology health care data recorded by multiple organizations and individuals. The strength of CTV3 was its terminologies for general practice. CTV3, with 200,000 interrelated concepts, was used for storing structured information about primary care encounters in individual, patient-based records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In July 2003, the [[National Library of Medicine]] (NLM), on behalf of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, entered into an agreement with the College of American Pathologists to make SNOMED CT available to U.S. users at no cost through the National Library of Medicine's [[Unified Medical Language System]] [[UMLS Metathesaurus]]. The contract provided NLM with a perpetual license for the core SNOMED CT (in Spanish and English) and its ongoing updates.&lt;ref name="NLM-UMLS-add" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_license.html |title=SNOMED license agreement |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |date=24 May 2006 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_main.html Unified Medical Language System]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, SNOMED CT intellectual property rights were transferred from the CAP to the [[International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation]] (IHTSDO) in order to promote international adoption and use of SNOMED CT. Now trading as SNOMED International, the organization is responsible for "ongoing maintenance, development, quality assurance, and distribution of SNOMED CT" internationally&lt;ref name="ihtsdo-history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nehta.gov.au" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NLM-SNOMED-FAQ" /&gt;

SNOMED CT is a multinational and multilingual terminology, which can manage different languages and dialects. SNOMED CT is currently available in American English, British English, Spanish, Danish and Swedish, with other translations underway or nearly completed in French and Dutch.  SNOMED CT cross maps to other terminologies, such as: [[ICD-9-CM]], [[ICD-10]], [[ICD-O-3]], [[ICD-10-AM]], Laboratory [[LOINC]] and [[OPCS-4]]. It supports [[ANSI]], [[DICOM]], [[HL7]], and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards. SNOMED CT is currently used in a joint project with the World Health Organization (WHO) as the [[Ontology (information science)|ontological]] basis of the upcoming [[ICD-11]].

== Structure ==
SNOMED CT consists of four primary core components:
# '''Concept Codes''' – numerical codes that identify clinical terms, primitive or defined, organized in hierarchies
# '''Descriptions''' – textual descriptions of Concept Codes
# '''Relationships''' – relationships between Concept Codes that have a related meaning
# '''Reference Sets''' – used to group Concepts or Descriptions into sets, including reference sets and cross-maps to other classifications and standards.&lt;ref&gt;SNOMED CT and HL7 – Bringing Standards Together [http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public_temp_5E4FAEB4-1C23-BA17-0C88EADCFB60FF46/calendarofevents/himss/2012/SNOMED%20CT%20and%20HL7%20--%20Bringing%20Standards%20Together.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

SNOMED CT "Concepts" are representational units that categorize all the things that characterize healthcare processes and need to be recorded therein. In 2011, SNOMED CT included more than 311,000 concepts, which are uniquely identified by a concept ID, e.g. the concept 22298006 refers to ''Myocardial infarction''. All SNOMED CT concepts are organized into acyclic taxonomic (is-a) hierarchies; for example, ''Viral pneumonia'' IS-A ''Infectious pneumonia'' IS-A ''Pneumonia'' IS-A ''Lung disease''.  Concepts may have multiple parents, for example ''Infectious pneumonia'' is also a [[Hierarchical database model|child]] of ''Infectious disease''. The taxonomic structure allows data to be recorded and later accessed at different levels of aggregation.
SNOMED CT concepts are linked by approximately 1,360,000 links, called ''relationships''.&lt;ref&gt;SNOMED CT Documentation is publicly available at http://www.snomed.org/doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Concepts are further described by various clinical terms or phrases, called Descriptions, which are divided into ''Fully Specified Names'' (FSNs), ''Preferred Terms'' (PTs), and ''Synonyms''.  Each Concept has exactly one FSN, which is unique across all of SNOMED CT. It has, in addition, exactly one PT, which has been decided by a group of clinicians to be the most common way of expressing the meaning of the concept. It may have zero to many Synonyms. Synonyms are additional terms and phrases used to refer to this concept. They do not have to be unique or unambiguous.

=== The formal model underlying SNOMED CT ===
[[File:2017-01-26 12 17 34-SNOMED CT Statistics.png|thumb|SNOMED CT statistics (as of November 2016). SD stands for sufficiently defined.]]
SNOMED CT can be characterized as a multilingual thesaurus with an [[Ontology (information science)|ontological foundation]]. Thesaurus-like features are concept–term relations such as the synonymous descriptions "Acute coryza", "Acute nasal catarrh", "Acute rhinitis", "Common cold" (as well as Spanish "resfrío común" and "rinitis infecciosa") for the concept 82272006.

Under [[Ontology (information science)|ontological]] scrutiny, SNOMED-CT is a [[Hierarchical database model|class hierarchy]] (with extensive overlap of classes in contrast to typical statistical classifications like ICD).
This means that the SNOMED CT concept 82272006 defines the class of all the individual disease instances that match the criteria for "common cold" (e.g., one patient may have "head cold" noted in their record, and another may have "Acute coryza"; both can be found as instances of "common cold").
The superclass (Is-A) Relation relates classes in terms of inclusion of their members. That is, all individual "cold-processes" are also included in all superclasses of the class Common Cold, such as Viral upper respiratory tract infection (Figure).
[[File:SNOMED primitive concept.jpg|thumb|''Common cold'' as a primitive concept in SNOMED CT]]

SNOMED CT's relational statements are basically triplets of the form Concept&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – Relation&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; – Concept&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with Relation&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; being from a small number of relation types (called linkage concepts), e.g. ''finding site'', ''due to'', etc. The interpretation of these triplets is (implicitly) based on the semantics of a simple [[Description logic]] (DL). E.g., the triplet ''Common Cold'' – '''causative agent''' – ''Virus'', corresponds to the first-order expression

&lt;code&gt;
forall x:  instance-of (x, ''Common cold'') -&gt;  exists y: instance-of (y, ''Virus'') and '''causative-agent''' (y, x)
&lt;/code&gt;

or the more intuitive DL expression

&lt;code&gt;
''Common cold'' subClassOf '''causative-agent''' some ''Virus''
&lt;/code&gt;

In the ''Common cold'' example the concept description is "primitive", which means that necessary criteria are given that must be met for each instance, without being sufficient for classifying a disorder as an instance of ''Common Cold'' . In contrast, the example ''Viral upper respiratory tract infection'' depicts a fully described concept, which is represented in description logic as follows:

[[File:SNOMED defined concept.jpg|thumb|''Viral upper respiratory tract infection'' as a defined concept in SNOMED CT]]

  ''Viral upper respiratory tract infection'' equivalentTo
  	''Upper respiratory infection'' and ''Viral respiratory infection'' and
  		'''Causative-agent''' some ''Virus'' and
  		'''Finding-site''' some ''Upper respiratory tract structure'' and
  		'''Pathological-process''' some ''Infectious process''

This means that each and every individual disorder for which all definitional criteria are met can be classified as an instance of Viral upper respiratory tract infection.

=== Description logics ===
As of 2011, SNOMED CT content limits itself to a subset of the [[EL++]] formalism, restricting itself to the following operators:
*Top, bottom
*Primitive roles and concepts with asserted parent(s) for each
*Concept definition and conjunction but NOT disjunction or negation
*Role hierarchy but not role composition
*Domain and range constraints
*Existential but not universal restriction
*A restricted form of role inclusion axiom (xRy ^ ySz =&gt; xRz)
*The logic will be extended in the near future to include General Concept Inclusion Axioms.

For understanding the modelling, it is also important to look at the stated view of a concept versus the inferred view of the concept. In further considering the state view, SNOMED CT used in the past an modelling approach referred to as 'proximal parent' approach. After 2015, a superior approach called "proximal primitive parent" has been adopted.

=== Precoordination and postcoordination ===

SNOMED CT provides a compositional syntax&lt;ref&gt;SNOMED CT Compositional Grammar http://doc.ihtsdo.org/download/doc_CompositionalGrammarSpecificationAndGuide_Current-en-US_INT_20150522.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that can be used to create expressions that represent clinical ideas which are not explicitly represented by SNOMED CT concepts.

For example, there is no explicit concept for a "third degree burn of left index finger caused by hot water". However, using the compositional syntax it can be represented as

 284196006 | burn of skin | :
    116676008 | associated morphology | = 80247002 | third degree burn injury |
  , 272741003 | laterality | = 7771000 | left |
  , 246075003 | causative agent | = 47448006 | hot water |
  , 363698007 | finding site | = 83738005 | index finger structure

Such expressions are said to have been 'postcoordinated'.  Post-coordination avoids the need to create large numbers of defined Concepts within SNOMED CT.  However, many systems only allow for precoordinated representations. Reliable analysis and comparison of post-coordinated expressions is possible using appropriate algorithms machinery to efficiently process the expression taking account of the underlying description logic.

Major Electronic Health Record Systems (EHRS) have repeated complained to IHTSDO and other standards organizations about the "complexity" of post-coordinated expressions.

For example, the postcoordinated expression above can be transformed using a set of standard rules to the following "normal form expression" which enables comparison with similar concepts.

 64572001 | disease | :
    246075003 | causative agent | = 47448006 | hot water |
  , 363698007 | finding site | = ( 83738005 | index finger structure | :
           272741003 | laterality | = 7771000 | left | )
  , { 116676008 | associated morphology | = 80247002 | third degree burn injury |
  , 363698007 | finding site | = 39937001 | skin structure | }

=== Veterinary content ===

The international edition of SNOMED CT only includes human terms. In 2015, clearly veterinary concepts were moved into a SNOMED CT veterinary extension. This extension is managed by a team at Virginia Tech University.

=== Known deficiencies and mitigation strategies ===

Earlier SNOMED versions had faceted structure ordered by semantic axes, requiring that more complex situations required to be coded by a coordination of different codes. This had two major shortcomings. On the one hand, the necessity of post-coordination was perceived as a user-unfriendly obstacle, which has certainly contributed to the rather low adoption of early SNOMED versions. On the other hand, uniform coding was difficult to obtain. E.g.,''Acute appendicitis'' could be post-coordinated in three different ways&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Spackman KA, Campbell KE | year = | title = Compositional concept representation using SNOMED: towards further convergence of clinical terminologies | url = | journal = Proc AMIA Symp. | volume = 1998 | issue = | pages = 740–744 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with no means to compute semantic equivalences.
SNOMED RT had addressed this problem by introducing description logic formula. With the addition of CTV3 a large number of concepts were redefined using formal expressions.  However, the fusion with CTV3, as a historically grown terminology with many close-to user descriptions, introduced some problems which still affect SNOMED CT. In addition to a confusing taxonomic web of many hierarchical levels with massive multiple inheritance (e.g. there are 36 taxonomic ancestors for ''Acute appendicitis''), many ambiguous, context-dependent concepts have found their way into SNOMED CT. Pre-coordination was sometimes pushed to extremes, so there are, for example, 350 different concepts for burns found on the head.

A further phenomenon which characterizes parts of SNOMED CT is the so-called ''epistemic intrusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Ingenerf |first1=J |last2=Linder |first2=R | year = 2009 | title = Assessing applicability of ontological principles to different types of biomedical vocabularies | url =http://methods.schattauer.de/en/contents/archivestandard/issue/985/manuscript/11459.html | journal = Methods of Information in Medicine | volume = 48 | issue = 5| pages = 459–467 | doi=10.3414/me0628}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In principle, the task of terminology (and even an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]]) should be limited to providing context-free term or class meanings. The contextualization of these representational units should be ideally the task of an information model.&lt;ref&gt;Rector A. (2008) Barriers, approaches and research priorities for integrating biomedical [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]]. Semantic Health Deliverable 6.1 {{cite web |url=http://www.semantichealth.org/DELIVERABLES/SemanticHEALTH_D6_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413034920/http://www.semantichealth.org/DELIVERABLES/SemanticHEALTH_D6_1.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Human language is misleading here, as we use syntactically similar expression to represent categorically distinct entities, e.g. ''Ectopic pregnancy'' vs. ''Suspected pregnancy''.  The first one refers to a real pregnancy, the second one to a piece of (uncertain) ''information''.  In SNOMED CT most (but not all) of these context-dependent concepts are concentrated in the subhierachy ''Situation with explicit context''. A major reason for why such concepts cannot be dispensed with is that SNOMED CT takes on, in many cases, the functionality of information models, as the latter do not exist in a given implementation.

With the establishment of IHTSDO, SNOMED CT became more accessible to a wider audience. Criticism of the state of the terminology was sparked by numerous substantive weaknesses as well as on the lack of quality assurance measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stefan Schulz |author2=Boontawee Suntisrivaraporn |author3=Franz Baader |author4=Martin Boeker |date=April 2009 |title=SNOMED reaching its adolescence: Ontologists’ and logicians’ health check |url=http://www.ijmijournal.com/article/S1386-5056%2808%2900091-9/abstract |journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics |volume=78 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=S86–S94 |doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2008.06.004 |pmid=18789754}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning IHTSDO was open regarding such (also academic) criticism. In the last few years considerable progress has been made regarding quality assurance and tooling.

The need for a more principled [[Ontology (information science)|ontological foundation]] was gradually accepted, as well as a better understanding of description logic semantics. Redesign priorities were formulated regarding observables,&lt;ref&gt;SNOMED CT® Style Guide: Observable Entities and Evaluation Procedures (Laboratory) Draft IHTSDO Standard v1.0, 2010-06-30, http://ihtsdo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Docs_01/Publications/Drafts_for_review/SNOMED_CT_Style_Guide_Observables_v1.0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; disorders, findings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schulz |first1=S |last2=Spackman |first2=K |last3=James |first3=A |last4=Cocos |first4=C |last5=Boeker |first5=M |title=Scalable representations of diseases in biomedical ontologies |journal=Journal of Biomedical Semantics |date=May 2011 |volume=17 |issue=2(Suppl 2) |page=S6}}&lt;/ref&gt; substances, organisms etc. Translation guidelines&lt;ref&gt;http://ihtsdo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Docs_01/About_IHTSDO/Publications/IHTSDO_Translation_Guidelines_v2.00_20100407.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; were elaborated as well as guidelines for content submission requests and a strategy for the inclusion of pre-coordinated content. There are still known deficiencies regarding the "[[ontological commitment]]" of SNOMED CT,&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, S; Cornet, R; Spackman, K Consolidating SNOMED CT’s .  Applied ontology. 2011; 6: 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., the clarification of which kind of entity is an instance of a given SNOMED CT concept. The same term can be interpreted as a disorder or a patient with a disorder, for example ''Tumour'' might denote a process or a piece of tissue; ''Allergy'' may denote an allergic reaction or just an allergic disposition. A more recent strategy is the use of rigorously typed upper-level [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] to disambiguate SNOMED CT content.

The increased take-up of SNOMED CT for research into applications in daily use across the world to support patient care is leading to a larger engaged community. This has led to an increase in the resource allocated to authoring SNOMED CT terms as well as to an increase in collaboration to take SNOMED CT into a robust industry used standard. This is leading to an increase in the number of software tools and development of materials that contribute to knowledge base to support implementation. A number of on-line communities that focus on particular aspects of SNOMED CT and its implementation are also developing.

In theory, description logic reasoning can be applied to any new candidate post-coordinated expressions in order to assess whether it is a parent or ancestor of, a child or other descendent of, or semantically equivalent to any existing concept from the existing pre-coordinated concepts. However, partly as the continuing fall-out from the merger with CTV3, SNOMED still contains undiscovered semantically duplicate primitive and defined concepts. Additionally, many concepts remain primitive whilst their semantics can also be legitimately defined in terms of other primitives and roles concurrently in the system. Because of these omissions and actual or possible redundancies of semantic content, real-world performance of algorithms to infer subsumption or semantic equivalence will be unpredictably imperfect.

=== SNOMED CT validation ===
Using consistent rules is important for the quality of SNOMED CT. To that end, in 2009, a prototype Machine Readable Concept Model (MRCM) was created by the SNOMED CT team. In a follow up work, this model is being revised to utilize SNOMED CT expression constraints.

=== SNOMED CT and LOINC ===
[[LOINC]] is a terminology that contains laboratory tests. Since 2017, SNOMED International started creating terms for LOINC components and created a set of SNOMED CT expressions that capture the meaning of many LOINC terms.

== Use ==
SNOMED CT is used in a number of different ways, some of which are:
* It captures clinical information at the level of detail needed for the provision of healthcare
* Through sharing data it can reduce the need to repeat health history at each new encounter with a healthcare professional
* Information can be recorded by different people in different locations and combined into simple information views within the patient record
* Use of a common terminology decreases the potential for differing interpretation of information
* Electronic recording in a common way reduces errors and can help to ensure completeness in recording all relevant data
* Standardised information makes analysis easier, supporting quality, cost effective practice, research and future clinical guideline development
* A clinical terminology allows a health care provider to identify patients based on specified coded information, and more effectively manage screening, treatment and follow up

=== Use cases ===
More specifically, the following sample computer applications use SNOMED CT:

*Electronic Health Record Systems
*Computerized Provider Order Entry [[CPOE]] such as E-Prescribing or Laboratory Order Entry
*Catalogues of clinical services; ''e.g.'', for Diagnostic Imaging procedures
*Knowledge databases used in [[clinical decision support system]]s (CDSS)

=== Access ===
SNOMED CT is maintained and distributed by SNOMED International, an international non-profit standards development organization, located in London, UK..

The use of SNOMED CT in production systems requires a license. There are two types of license:
# Country/territory membership in SNOMED International (charged according to [[gross national product]]).
# Affiliate license (dependent on the number of end users). LDCs (least developed countries) can use SNOMED CT without charges.

For scientific research in medical informatics, for demonstrations or evaluation purposes SNOMED CT sources can be freely downloaded and used. The original SNOMED CT sources in tabular form are accessible by registered users of the [[Unified Medical Language System]] (UMLS) who have signed an agreement. Numerous online and offline browsers are available.

Those wishing to obtain a license for its use and to download SNOMED CT should contact their National Release Centre, links to which are provided on the IHTSDO website.

==== License free subsets ====
To facilitate adoption of SNOMED CT and use of SNOMED CT in other standards, there are license free subsets. For example, a set of 7,314 codes and descriptions is free for use by users of [[DICOM]]-compliant software (without restriction to IHTSDO member countries).&lt;ref&gt;https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/pages/viewrecentblogposts.action?key=ILS&lt;/ref&gt;

== Top level concepts ==
SNOMED CT concepts typically belong a single hierarchy (with the exception of drug-device combined concepts). Some hierarchies, have a concept model defined (e.g., clinical findings). For other domains (e.g., Organism, Substance, Qualifier value), there is no concept model yet defined.

=== Event ===
As of 2016, the Event hierarchy does not have a concept model defined. In 2006, some concepts from the 'Clinical Finding' hierarchy were moved to the Event hierarchy. Those concepts retained some of their attributes. (e.g., causative agent)

=== Observable entities ===
SNOMED International is working on creating a concept model for observable entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/OBSERVABLE/Observables+Inception-Elaboration+document}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pharmaceutical / biologic product ===

The roles of "scientists", and their predecessors before the emergence of modern scientific disciplines, have evolved considerably over time.  Scientists of different eras (and before them, natural philosophers, mathematicians, natural historians, natural theologians, engineers, and others who contributed to the development of science) have had widely different places in society, and the [[social norms]], [[ethical values]], and [[epistemic virtues]] associated with scientists—and expected of them—have changed over time as well. Accordingly, many different historical figures can be identified as early scientists, depending on which characteristics of modern science are taken to be essential.

Some historians point to the [[Scientific Revolution]] that began in 16th century as the period when science in a recognizably modern form developed. It wasn't until the 19th century that sufficient socioeconomic changes occurred for scientists to emerge as a major profession.&lt;ref&gt;On the historical development of the character of scientists and the predecessors, see: Steven Shapin (2008). ''The Scientific Life: A Moral History of a Late Modern Vocation''.  Chicago: Chicago University Press. {{ISBN|0-226-75024-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical antiquity===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
[[History of science in classical antiquity|Knowledge about nature in classical antiquity]] was pursued by many kinds of scholars. [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] contributions to science—including works of geometry and mathematical astronomy, early accounts of biological processes and catalogs of plants and animals, and theories of knowledge and learning—were produced by [[philosopher]]s and [[physician]]s, as well as practitioners of various trades.  These roles, and their associations with scientific knowledge, spread with the [[Roman Empire]] and, with the [[History of Christianity#Church of the Roman Empire (313–476)|spread of Christianity]], became closely linked to religious institutions in most of European countries. [[Astrology]] and [[astronomy]] became an important area of knowledge, and the role of astronomer/astrologer developed with the support of political and religious [[patronage]].  By the time of the [[medieval university]] system, knowledge was divided into the ''[[Trivium (education)|trivium]]''—philosophy, including [[natural philosophy]]—and the ''[[quadrivium]]''—mathematics, including astronomy.  Hence, the medieval analogs of scientists were often either philosophers or mathematicians. Knowledge of plants and animals was broadly the province of physicians.

===Middle Ages===
[[Science in medieval Islam]] generated some new modes of developing natural knowledge, although still within the bounds of existing social roles such as philosopher and mathematician. Many proto-scientists from the [[Islamic Golden Age]] are considered polymaths, in part because of the lack of anything corresponding to modern [[scientific discipline]]s. Many of these early polymaths were also religious [[priest]]s and [[Theology|theologians]]: for example, [[Alhazen]] and [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī|al-Biruni]] were [[Kalam|mutakallimiin]]; the physician [[Avicenna]] was a [[Hafiz (Quran)|hafiz]]; the physician [[Ibn al-Nafis]] was a hafiz, [[muhaddith]] and [[ulema]]; the botanist [[Otto Brunfels]] was a theologian and historian of Protestantism; the astronomer and physician [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] was a priest. During the [[Italian Renaissance]] scientists like [[Leonardo Da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Gerolamo Cardano]] have been considered as the most recognizable polymaths.

===Renaissance===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
During the [[Renaissance]], [[Italians]] made substantial contributions in science. [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] made significant discoveries in paleontology and anatomy. The Father of modern Science,&lt;ref name="father of science Einstein"&gt;[[#Reference-Einstein-1954|Einstein (1954, p. 271)]]. "Propositions arrived at by purely logical means are completely empty as regards reality. Because Galileo realised this, and particularly because he drummed it into the scientific world, he is the father of modern physics—indeed, of modern science altogether."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking, [http://www.medici.org/press/galileo-and-birth-modern-science ''Galileo and the Birth of Modern Science''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324162930/http://www.medici.org/press/galileo-and-birth-modern-science |date=2012-03-24 }}, American Heritage's Invention &amp; Technology, Spring 2009, Vol. 24, No. 1, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Galileo Galilei]], made key improvements on the thermometer and telescope which allowed him to observe and clearly describe the solar system. [[René Descartes|Descartes]] was not only a pioneer of [[analytic geometry]] but formulated a [[theory]] of [[mechanics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Exploring the Limits of Preclassical Mechanics: A Study of Conceptual Development in Early Modern Science: Free Fall and Compounded Motion in the Work of Descartes, Galileo and Beeckman | publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media | year = 2004 | page = 6 | chapter = Introduction | author = Peter Damerow}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advanced ideas about the origins of [[muscle contraction|animal movement]] and [[perception]]. [[Visual perception|Vision]] interested the [[physicist]]s [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]], who also studied [[optics]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] and [[music]]. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] extended Descartes' mathematics by inventing [[calculus]] (contemporaneously with [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]). He provided a comprehensive formulation of [[classical mechanics]] and investigated [[light]] and optics. [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]] founded a new branch of mathematics — [[Fourier series|infinite, periodic series]] — studied [[heat]] [[flux#Flux definition and theorems|flow]] and [[infrared|infrared radiation]], and discovered the [[greenhouse effect]]. [[Girolamo Cardano]], [[Blaise Pascal]] [[Pierre de Fermat]], [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]], [[Alan Turing|Turing]], [[Aleksandr Khinchin|Khinchin]], [[Andrey Markov|Markov]] and [[Norbert Wiener|Wiener]], all mathematicians, made major contributions to science and [[probability|probability theory]], including the ideas behind [[computer]]s, and some of the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. Many mathematically inclined scientists, including [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], were also [[musician]]s.

There are many compelling stories in [[medicine]] and [[biology]], such as the development of ideas about the circulation of [[blood]] from [[Galen]] to [[William Harvey|Harvey]].

===Age of Enlightenment===
During the age of Enlightenment, [[Luigi Galvani]], the pioneer of the [[bioelectromagnetics]], discovered the animal electricity. He discovered that a charge applied to the spinal cord of a frog could generate muscular spasms throughout its body. Charges could make frog legs jump even if the legs were no longer attached to a frog. While cutting a frog leg, Galvani's steel scalpel touched a brass hook that was holding the leg in place. The leg twitched. Further experiments confirmed this effect, and Galvani was convinced that he was seeing the effects of what he called animal electricity, the life force within the muscles of the frog. At the University of Pavia, Galvani's colleague [[Alessandro Volta]] was able to reproduce the results, but was sceptical of Galvani's explanation.&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{cite book|title=A popular history of science|author=Robert Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VO1HAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA553|page=553 |edition=2nd|year=1881|publisher=G. Routledge and Sons|isbn=0-415-38381-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] is one of the most influential figures in experimental physiology and the natural sciences. His investigations have exerted a lasting influence on the medical sciences. He made important contributions to the experimental study of bodily functions and animal reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-3.unipv.it/webbio/spalla99/spallanz.htm|title=Spallanzani - Uomo e scienziato|publisher=Il museo di Lazzaro Spallanzani|language=Italian|accessdate=2010-06-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603044941/http://www-3.unipv.it/webbio/spalla99/spallanz.htm|archivedate=2010-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francesco Redi]] discovered that [[microorganism]]s can cause [[disease]]. 

===19th century===
Until the late 19th or early 20th century, scientists were still referred to as "[[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]]" or "men of science".&lt;ref&gt;Nineteenth-Century Attitudes: Men of Science. {{cite web |url=http://www.rpi.edu/~rosss2/book.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309165847/http://www.rpi.edu/~rosss2/book.html |archivedate=2008-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Ueberweg, History of Philosophy: From Thales to the Present Time.

English philosopher and historian of science [[William Whewell]] coined the term ''scientist'' in 1833, and it first appeared in print in Whewell's anonymous 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''[[On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences]]'' published in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]''.&lt;ref name=Ross1962&gt;{{Cite journal| format = PDF | author = Ross, Sydney | year = 1962 | title = Scientist: The story of a word | journal = [[Annals of Science]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 65–85 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/index/739364907.pdf | accessdate = 2011-03-08 | doi = 10.1080/00033796200202722| ref = harv}} To be exact, the person coined the term ''scientist'' was referred to in Whewell 1834 only as "some ingenious gentleman." Ross added a comment that this "some ingenious gentleman" was Whewell himself, without giving the reason for the identification. Ross 1962, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; Whewell's suggestion of the term was partly satirical, a response to changing conceptions of science itself in which natural knowledge was increasingly seen as distinct from other forms of knowledge.  Whewell wrote of "an increasing proclivity of separation and dismemberment" in the sciences; while highly specific terms proliferated—chemist, mathematician, naturalist—the broad term "philosopher" was no longer satisfactory to group together those who pursued science, without the caveats of "natural" or "experimental" philosopher.  Members of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] had been complaining about the lack of a good term at recent meetings, Whewell reported in his review; alluding to himself, he noted that "some ingenious gentleman proposed that, by analogy with ''artist'', they might form [the word] ''scientist'', and added that there could be no scruple in making free with this term since we already have such words as ''[[economist]]'', and ''[[atheist]]''—but this was not generally palatable".&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |year= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whewell proposed the word again more seriously (and not anonymously) in his 1840&lt;ref name=Whewell&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whewell|first=William|title=The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences Volume 1|publisher=John W Parker J&amp;J Deighton|location=Cambridge|page=cxiii}}{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fe8TAAAAQAAJ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430103654/https://books.google.com/books?id=Fe8TAAAAQAAJ |archivedate=2016-04-30 |df= }}.  In the 1847 second edition, moved to volume 2 page 560.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences'':
{{quote|As we cannot use physician for a cultivator of physics, I have called him a physicist. We need very much a name to describe a cultivator of science in general. I should incline to call him a Scientist. Thus we might say, that as an Artist is a Musician, Painter, or Poet, a Scientist is a Mathematician, Physicist, or Naturalist.}}
He also proposed the term ''physicist'' at the same time, as a counterpart to the French word ''physicien''.  Neither term gained wide acceptance until decades later; ''scientist'' became a common term in the late 19th century in the United States and around the turn of the 20th century in Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Ross1962/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.victorianweb.org/science/whewell.html|title= William Whewell (1794-1866) gentleman of science|accessdate= 2007-05-19|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070625171128/http://www.victorianweb.org/science/whewell.html|archivedate= 2007-06-25|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamara Preaud, Derek E. Ostergard, The Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory. Yale University Press 1997. 416 pages. {{ISBN|0-300-07338-0}} Page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; By the twentieth century, the modern notion of science as a special brand of information about the world, practiced by a distinct group and pursued through a unique method, was essentially in place.

===20th century===
[[Santiago Ramón y Cajal|Ramón y Cajal]] won the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1906 for his remarkable observations in [[neuroscience|neuroanatomy]].

[[Marie Curie]] became the first female to win the Nobel Prize and the first person to win it twice. Her efforts led to the development of nuclear energy and Radio therapy for the treatment of cancer. In 1922, she was appointed a member of the International Commission on Intellectual Co-operation by the Council of the League of Nations. She campaigned for scientist's right to patent their discoveries and inventions. She also campaigned for free access to international scientific literature and for internationally recognized scientific symbols.

==Profession==
As a profession, the scientist of today is widely recognized. 

===Education===
In modern times, many professional scientists are trained in an [[Academy|academic setting]] (e.g., [[universities]] and [[research institute]]s), mostly at the level of [[graduate school]]s. Upon completion, they would normally attain an [[academic degree]], with the highest degree being a [[doctorate]] such as a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD),&lt;ref name="Cyranoski2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cyranoski | first1 = David | last2 = Gilbert | first2 = Natasha | last3 = Ledford | first3 = Heidi | last4 = Nayar | first4 = Anjali | last5 = Yahia | first5 = Mohammed | year = 2011 | title = Education: The PhD factory | journal = Nature | volume = 472 | pages = 276-279 | doi = 10.1038/472276a | url = https://www.nature.com/news/2011/110420/full/472276a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD), [[Doctor of Engineering]] (DEng), or even a dual doctoral degree (e.g., [[MD–PhD|MD, PhD]]). Although [[Postgraduate education|graduate education]] for scientists varies among institutions and countries, some common training requirements include [[Academic specialization|specializing]] in an [[Branches of science| area]] of interest,&lt;ref name="Editorial2015"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2015 | title = STEM education: To build a scientist | journal = Nature | volume = 523 | pages = 371–373 | url = https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v523/n7560/full/nj7560-371a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; publishing research findings in [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]]s&lt;ref name="Gould2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gould | first1 = Julie | year = 2016 | title = What’s the point of the PhD thesis? | journal = Nature | volume = 535 | pages = 26–28 | url = https://www.nature.com/news/what-s-the-point-of-the-phd-thesis-1.20203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presenting them at [[Academic conference|scientific conferences]],&lt;ref name="Kruger2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kruger | first1 = Philipp | year = 2018 | title = Why it is not a ‘failure’ to leave academia | journal = Nature | volume = 560 | pages = 133–134 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05838-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving [[lecture]]s or [[Teacher|teaching]],&lt;ref name="Kruger2018"/&gt; and defending a [[Thesis|thesis (or dissertation)]] during an [[oral exam]]ination.&lt;ref name="Cyranoski2011"/&gt; To aid them in this endeavor, graduate students often work under the guidance of a [[Mentorship|mentor]], usually a senior scientist, which may continue after the completion of their doctorates whereby they work as [[postdoctoral researcher]]s.&lt;ref name="Lee2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = Adrian | last2 = Dennis | first2 = Carina | last3 = Campbell | first3 = Phillip | year = 2007 | title = Nature's guide for mentors | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | pages = 791–797 | url = https://www.nature.com/news/2011/110420/full/472276a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
After the completion of their training, many scientists pursue careers in a variety of work settings and conditions.&lt;ref name="Kwok2017"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kwok | first1 = Roberta | title = Flexible working: Science in the gig economy | journal = Nature | volume = 550 | pages = 419-421 | url = http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7676-419a | doi = 10.1038/nj7677-549a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the British [[scientific journal]] ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published the results of a large-scale survey of more than 5,700 doctoral students worldwide, asking them which [[Economic sector|sectors of the economy]] that would like to work in. A little over half of the respondents wanted to pursue a career in academia, with smaller proportions hoping to work in [[industry]], [[Government scientist|government]], and [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] environments.&lt;ref name="Editorial2017a"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2007 | title = Many junior scientists need to take a hard look at their job prospects | journal = Nature | editor = Editorial | volume = 550 | pages = | url = https://www.nature.com/news/many-junior-scientists-need-to-take-a-hard-look-at-their-job-prospects-1.22879 | doi = 10.1038/nj7677-549a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woolston2017"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = Adrian | last2 = Dennis | first2 = Carina | last3 = Campbell | first3 = Phillip | year = 2007 | title = Graduate survey: A love–hurt relationship | journal = Nature | volume = 550 | pages = 549–552 | url = https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7677-549a | doi = 10.1038/nj7677-549a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists are motivated to work in several ways. Many have a desire to understand why the [[world]] is as we see it and how it came to be. They exhibit a strong curiosity about [[reality]]. Other motivations are recognition by their peers and prestige. The [[Nobel Prize]], a widely regarded prestigious award,&lt;ref name = "Stockton2014"&gt; {{citation | last = Stockton | first = Nick | title = How did the Nobel Prize become the biggest award on Earth? | newspaper = Wired | date = 7 October 2014 | url = https://www.wired.com/2014/10/whats-nobel-prize-become-biggest-award-planet | access-date = 3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is awarded annually to those who have achieved scientific advances in the fields of [[medicine]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[economics]].  
Some scientists have a desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of people's health, the nations, the world, nature, or industries (academic scientist and [[industrial scientist]]). Scientists tend to be less motivated by direct financial reward for their work than other careers. As a result, scientific researchers often accept lower average salaries when compared with many other professions which require a similar amount of training and qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/article-2269520/Best-paid-jobs-2012-Official-figures-national-average-UK-salaries-400-occupations.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706211607/http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/article-2269520/Best-paid-jobs-2012-Official-figures-national-average-UK-salaries-400-occupations.html |archivedate=2014-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Research interests====
Scientists include [[experiment]]alists who mainly perform experiments to test hypotheses, and [[Scientific theory|theoreticians]] who mainly develop [[Scientific modelling|models]] to explain existing data and predict new results. There is a continuum between two activities and the division between them is not clear-cut, with many scientists performing both tasks.

Those considering science as a [[career]] often look to the frontiers. These include [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[biology]], especially [[molecular biology]] and the [[human genome]] project. Other areas of active research include the exploration of [[matter]] at the scale of [[elementary particle]]s as described by [[particle physics|high-energy physics]], and [[materials science]], which seeks to discover and design new materials. Although there have been remarkable discoveries with regard to [[Human brain|brain]] function and [[neurotransmitter]]s, the nature of the [[mind]] and [[human]] [[thought]] still remains unknown.

=== By country ===
The number of scientists is vastly different from country to country. For instance, there are only four full-time scientists per 10,000 workers in [[India]] while this number is 79 for the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name = "Noorden2015"&gt;Richard van Noorden (2015) India by the numbers.

==== United States ====
According to the United States [[National Science Foundation]] 4.7 million people with science degrees worked in the United States in 2015, across all disciplines and employment sectors. The figure included twice as many men as women. Of that total, 17% worked in academia, that is, at universities and undergraduate institutions, and men held 53% of those positions. 5% of scientists worked for the federal government and about 3.5% were self-employed. Of the latter two groups, two-thirds were men. 59% of US scientists were employed in industry or business, and another 6% worked in non-profit positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-22|title=Employment: Male majority|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nj7642-509b|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=542|issue=7642|pages=509–509|doi=10.1038/nj7642-509b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By gender ===
{{See also|Women in science}}
Scientist and engineering statistics are usually intertwined, but they indicate that women enter the field far less than men, though this gap is narrowing. The number of science and engineering doctorates awarded to women rose from a mere 7 percent in 1970 to 34 percent in 1985 and in engineering alone the numbers of bachelor's degrees awarded to women rose from only 385 in 1975 to more than 11000 in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Women's Science: Learning and Succeeding from the Margins | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 1998 |author = Margaret A.

'''Slooh''' is a [[robotic telescope]] service that can be viewed live through a [[web browser]] with [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] [[browser plug-in|plug-in]]. It was not the first robotic telescope, but it was the first that offered "live" viewing through a telescope via the [[World Wide Web|web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The site has a patent on their live image processing method.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent |country=US |number=7194146 |status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slooh is an online astronomy platform with live-views and telescope rental for a fee.&lt;ref name=rodenberg&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/telescopes/4349969  Cassie Rodenberg, "The Best in Armchair Astronomy", '''Popular Mechanics''' (March 22, 2010) - Accessed October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Observations come from a global network of telescopes located in places including [[Spain]] and [[Chile]].&lt;ref name=rodenberg/&gt;

The name Slooh comes from the word "[[slew (spacecraft)|slew]]" to indicate the movement of a [[telescope]], modified with "ooh" to express pleasure and surprise.

==History==
The service was founded in 2002 by Michael Paolucci. As of October 2009, Paolucci remains as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slooh.com/about.php|title=SLOOH - About Us|accessdate=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service went online December 25, 2003 but was not available to the public until 2004.

==Participating observatories==
The original [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] is located on the island [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]] on the [[volcano]] called [[Teide]]. The site is at the {{convert|2300|m|adj=on}}&lt;!--altitude is expressed in metres--&gt; [[elevation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SLOOH - System Specifications|url=http://www.slooh.com/specs.php|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and situated away from city [[light pollution]]. This (Canary Islands) site includes 2 [[domes]], each with 2 telescopes. Each dome has a high-[[magnification]] telescope and a [[field of view|wide-field]] telescope. One dome is optimized for [[planet]]ary views (e.g., more magnification and a different [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]), and the other is optimized for [[deep sky objects]] (e.g., less magnification, more light sensitive CCD).

'''''Stephen Hawking: Master of the Universe''''' is a documentary [[television series]] produced by the [[television]] broadcaster [[Channel 4|Channel 5]]. The subject of the series is British [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[Stephen Hawking]], known for his work on [[black holes|black hoes]], who is also the presenter of the series. The series includes interviews with astrophysicist [[Kim Weaver]], [[Bernard Carr]], a student of Hawking's, and three theoretical physicists: [[Michio Kaku]], [[Edward Witten]], known for his work on [[superstring theory]], and [[Lisa Randall]]. The first episode premiered in 2008, twenty years after the publication of Hawking's bestselling [[popular science]] book ''[[A Brief History of Time]]''.&lt;ref name="c4"/&gt; The title is derived from a ''[[Newsweek]]'' cover,".&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite book |title= Stephen Hawking: An Unfettered Mind |last= Ferguson |first= Kitty |year= 2012|publisher= Macmillan |location= |isbn= 9781137000224 | page= 146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series consisted of two episodes. The first describes Hawking's personal life, his challenges in overcoming his [[motor neurone disease]], and his career in physics. It covers his childhood, education, marriage, family life, and his work on the [[Big Bang]] and [[black holes]]. The second episode discusses [[string theory]] and [[supersymmetry]].&lt;ref name="c4"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.channel4.com/programmes/master-of-the-universe |title= Stephen Hawking: Master of the Universe |publisher= Channel 4 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both episodes are 48 minutes long, and premiered as half hour-long programes.&lt;ref name="c4"/&gt; The series was released on CD by Channel 4 in the UK as a [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 2]], one disc-DVD (B00140SGOM) on 18 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawking|first=Stephen|title=Prof Steven Hawking: A brief history of time|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/large-hadron-collider/3326879/Prof-Steven-Hawking-A-brief-history-of-time-contd.html|accessdate=31 July 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=26 Feb 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The premiere of the first episode attracted 1.9&amp;nbsp;million viewers, and was considered a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Five off to a strong start with Breaking into Tesco |first= David |last=Darren|url= http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/787811/Five-off-strong-start-Breaking-Tesco/|newspaper=Brand Republic|date= 4 March 2008|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second episode had 1.7&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Fixer brings crime drama joy to ITV |first= Daniel|last=Farey-Jones|url= http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/789621/Fixer-brings-crime-drama-joy-ITV/|newspaper=Brand Republic|date= 11 March 2008|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Walton of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote a positive review of the first episode, saying that it "hadn’t done a bad job of trying to explain advanced physics to the science novice," even if it was "extremely difficult stuff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Last night on television: Stephen Hawking: Master of the Universe |first= James |last=Walton |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3671613/Last-night-on-television-Stephen-Hawking-Master-of-the-Universe-Channel-4-The-Palace-ITV1.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date= 4 March 2008|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Wakefield, a television critic for ''[[stuff.co.nz]]'', listed the first episode in his "Top TV picks", calling it "the neatest illustration of Einstein’s theory of relativity I’ve ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Top 10 TV picks: December 2–8 |first= Philip |last=Wakefield |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/742244|newspaper=stuff.co.nz|date= 1 December 2008|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Wollastan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was more critical of the series, but did praise it for showing "the little glimpses of Prof Hawking's private life, like sharing a takeaway curry with a group of adoring young disciples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Last night's TV: Stephen Hawking: Master of the Universe |first= San |last=Wollastan |url= https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/mar/04/lastnightstvstephenhawking |newspaper=The Guardian|date= 3 March 2008|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Pesticide Question: Environment, Economics and Ethics''''' is a 1993 book edited by [[David Pimentel]] and Hugh Lehman. Use of pesticides has improved agricultural productivity, but there are also concerns about safety, health and the environment.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entomology.cornell.edu/Faculty_Staff/Pimentel/pimentel.html Cornell Entomology -- David Pimental]&lt;/ref&gt;  

This book is the result of research by leading scientists and policy experts into the non-technical and social issues of pesticides. In examining the social policies related to pesticides use, they consider the costs as well as the benefits. The book says that [[Intensive farming]] cannot completely do without synthetic chemicals, but that it is technologically possible to reduce the amount of [[pesticide]]s used in the United States by 35-50 per cent without reducing crop yields. The researchers show that to regain public trust, those who regulate and use pesticides must examine fair ethical questions and take appropriate action to protect public welfare, health, and the environment. Anyone concerned with reducing our reliance on chemical pesticides and how human activities can remain both productive and environmentally sound will find this volume a stimulating contribution to a troubling debate.&lt;ref name=review&gt;Foster, John and Mark Walton. "Book Review: The Pesticide Question", ''Australian Journal of Environmental Management'', March 1995, pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Pesticide Question'' builds on the 1962 best seller book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by [[Rachel Carson]].  Carson did not reject the use of pesticides, but argued that their use was often indiscriminate and resulted in harm to people and the environment.  She also highlighted the problem of pests becoming resistant to pesticides.&lt;ref name=review/&gt;

Carson's work is referred to many times in ''The Pesticide Question'', which critically explores many non-technical issues associated with pesticide use, mainly in the United States.  The book has 40 contributors, mainly academics from a wide range of disciplines.  ''The Pesticide Question'' is divided into five main parts:

* social and environmental effects of pesticides;
* methods and effects of reducing pesticide use;
* government policy and pesticide use;
* history, public attitudes, and ethics in regard to pesticide use; and
* the benefits and risks of pesticides.&lt;ref name=review/&gt;

The '''Woods–Saxon potential''' is a [[mean field]] [[potential]] for the [[nucleon]]s ([[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) inside the [[atomic nucleus]], which is used to describe approximately the forces applied on each [[nucleon]], in the [[nuclear shell model]] for the structure of the nucleus.

The form of the potential, in terms of the distance ''r'' from the center of nucleus, is:

&lt;math&gt;V(r) = -\frac{V_0}{1+\exp({r-R\over a})}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (having dimension of energy) represents the potential well depth,
''a'' is a length representing the "surface thickness" of the nucleus, and &lt;math&gt;R = r_0  A^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Nuclear size|nuclear radius]] where {{nowrap|''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{val|1.25|ul=fm}}}} and ''A'' is the [[mass number]].

Typical values for the parameters are: {{nowrap|''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;asymp; {{val|50|ul=MeV}}}}, {{nowrap|''a'' &amp;asymp; {{val|0.5|u=fm}}}}.

For large atomic number ''A'' this potential is similar to a [[potential well]]. It has the following desired properties
* It is monotonically increasing with distance, i.e. attracting.
* For large ''A'', it is approximately flat in the center.
* Nucleons near the surface of the nucleus (i.e. having {{nowrap|''r'' &amp;asymp; ''R''}} within a distance of order ''a'') experience a large force towards the center.
* It rapidly approaches zero as ''r'' goes to infinity ({{nowrap|''r'' − ''R''  &gt;&gt; ''a''}}), reflecting the short-distance nature of the [[strong nuclear force]].

When using the [[Schrödinger equation]] to find the energy levels of nucleons subjected to the Woods–Saxon potential, it cannot be solved [[analytic solution|analytically]], and must be treated numerically.
