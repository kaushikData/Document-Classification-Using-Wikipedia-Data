The '''6AK5''' [[vacuum tube]] is a miniature 7-pin sharp-cutoff [[pentode]] used as [[Radio frequency|RF]] or [[Intermediate frequency|IF]] [[amplifier]] especially in high-frequency wide-band applications at frequencies up to 400 [[MHz]].

It was developed by Bell Labs / Western Electric and used extensively as an I.F. amplifier in World War II radar systems.  The tube is notable for its extremely fine grid, and extremely close control grid to cathode spacing, yielding excellent high-frequency performance.

It is also known as '''EF95''' under its [[Mullard–Philips tube designation|Mullard–Phillips]] designation and was produced in the former [[Soviet Union]] as type '''6Zh1P''' (Russian: '''6Ж1П''') under the [[Russian tube designations|Russian designation]] system.

A version of this tube with extended ratings was designated '''6AK5W''' and '''6Zh1P-EV''' (Russian: '''6Ж1П-ЕВ''') respectively.

Even though primarily intended for VHF amplification, the tube has found some use in [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] applications as a [[microphone]] preamplifier, for instance in the [[LOMO]] 19A9 microphone and in [[guitar]] effects [[Effects pedal|stompboxes]], such as [[Metasonix]] TM-7 Scrotum Smasher.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The 6AK5 was used in some types of [[radiosonde]] (weather balloon  payloads), in the 1960s and 70s. Because of the non-recoverable nature of the equipment, the single 6AK5 was soldered directly to the printed circuit board and served as the only active device in the circuit, performing the function of a low frequency modulation oscillator and the high frequency carrier oscillator and output stage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3017">The '''Association of Personal Computer User Groups (APCUG)''' is a worldwide organization that helps [[computer user group]]s by facilitating communications between APCUG member groups, computer hardware and software makers, and hardware and software vendors. A non-profit corporation as designated by the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]], APCUG also helps member groups and their officers fulfill their education goals with support materials and shared knowledge and experience.

While a large number of member groups in APCUG are oriented towards the [[Microsoft]] [[DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating systems, many member groups have SIGs (Special Interest Groups), Forums, Classes, etc. for Apple and Android devices as well as the Linux OS and Chromebooks. Membership is open to all technology user groups.

APCUG itself is not a user group; only user groups/clubs themselves are members. APCUG services are offered to group leaders and members.

==History==

'''APCUG''' began after a series of meetings and discussions between representatives from various user groups around the country about improving communications between groups and sharing information. The presidents from three user groups—Boston Computer Society, Capital PC User Group, and Houston Area League of PC Users—organized the First Annual User Group Summit meeting at the 1986 Fall Comdex.

After that first Summit meeting and subsequent meetings, the leaders of 15 user groups met in Seattle in October 1987 and proposed the formation of an association for the purpose of fostering communication among and between user groups. That proposal was presented before 130 representatives from 50 user groups at the Second Annual User Group Summit Meeting in November 1987 and was unanimously approved.

==Products and services==

'''APCUG''' offers many benefits to its member groups, including:
* Speakers Bureau featuring over 100 presentations in 20+ categories that Speaker Bureau presenters can give to groups via interactive webinars
* Quartely Virtual Technology Conferences (VTC) each with six different presentations to enhance members’ tech knowledge or ideas for running their group
* VTC videos that can be used for group presentations
* PUSH tech articles sent to editors to use in their newsletters
* Quarterly Reports newsletter with region reports that let member groups know what other groups are doing; ideas for running member groups, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7806">The [[Atari]] '''AMY''' (or '''Amy''') was a 64-oscillator [[Additive synthesis|additive synthesizer]] implemented as a single-IC [[sound chip]]. It was initially developed as part of a larger effort to develop a 16/[[32-bit]] workstation known as [[Atari Sierra|Sierra]], but this project was cancelled in 1984. For a time, AMY was slated to be included in the [[Atari 520ST]], then an updated version of the [[Atari 8-bit family]], the 65XEM, but development was discontinued. The technology was later sold, but when the new owners started to introduce it as a professional [[synthesizer]], Atari sued, and work on the project ended.

==Description==
The AMY was based around a bank of 64 oscillators, which emit [[sine wave]]s of a specified frequency. The sine waves were created by looking up the amplitude at a given time from a 16-bit table stored in [[Read-only memory|ROM]], rather than calculating the amplitude using math hardware. The signals could then be mixed together to perform [[additive synthesis]]. The AMY also included a number of ramp generators that could be used to smoothly modify the amplitude or frequency of a given oscillator over a given time. During the design phase, it was believed these would be difficult to implement in hardware, so only eight frequency ramps are included.&lt;ref name=amy&gt;[http://www.atarimax.com/jindroush.atari.org/achamy.html "AMY"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="man4"&gt;''Specs'' 1983, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Sounds were created by selecting one of the oscillators to be the master channel, and then attaching other oscillators and ramps to it, slaved to some multiple of the fundamental frequency. Sound programs then sent the AMY a series of instructions setting the master frequency, and instructions on how quickly to ramp to new values. The output of the multiple oscillators was then summed and sent to the output. The AMY allowed the oscillators to be combined in any fashion, two at a time, to produce up to eight output channels. The output was then converted to analog in a separate (user-provided) [[digital-to-analog converter]].&lt;ref name=man4/&gt;

While the additive synth system works well for sounds with a narrow spectrum, it is not useful for wider spectrum sounds like [[white noise]]. To fill the need to generate the sounds of explosions, jet engines and similar sounds, AMY also included random noise generators that could be mixed into the master oscillator to randomly shift the output.&lt;ref name=amy/&gt;

The AMY was particularly useful for digital sound playback given the limited memory and bandwidth resources available at the time. An input sample could be run through a [[Fast Fourier transform]] to extract the spectral pattern, and then that pattern could be input to the AMY to set up the oscillators. The result is a highly accurate rendition of the original signal, but reduced to a handful of parameters that could easily be stored. That pattern could then be shifted up or down simply by changing the frequency of the master oscillator, with the slaved oscillators following those changes naturally. In one experiment, telephone-quality voice audio was produced using this method, requiring only 2400 [[baud]] of bandwidth.&lt;ref name=amy/&gt;

==History==
===Development at Atari===
Amy was developed as an experiment within the Sunnyvale Research Lab (SRL) of Atari, starting in 1983. Amy's system design was based on Hal Alles' experimental work at [[Bell Labs]] during the 1970s, which produced a similar system that required several racks of equipment to implement the so-called [[Alles Machine]]. Several of Alles' solutions to particularly thorny implementation issues were used in Amy.&lt;ref name=amy/&gt; The Amy team was led by Gary Sikorski, and the primary architects were Scott Foster and Steve Saunders. The single-chip implementation was handled by Sam Nicolino, while Jack Palevich{{efn|Better known for his game [[Dandy (video game)|Dandy]].}} and Tom Zimmerman wrote support software.&lt;ref name=amy/&gt;

Amy was announced in an Atari-internal mailing list in March 1984, with a short description and a June estimated time frame for shipping the first version, the AMY-1, with volume quantities available that December.&lt;ref name=amy/&gt; The first versions would run up to 5 MHz, but a second run improved this to 10 MHz. Spec sheets used 4 and 8 MHz and basic clock speeds, respectively.&lt;ref name="man8"&gt;''Specs'' 1983, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial target for Amy was a 16/32-bit computer also being designed by SRL, known as the [[Atari Sierra]]. Sierra used Amy for sound and a pair of chips code-named "Gold" and "Silver" for graphics, and was considering either the [[intel 286]] or [[Motorola 68000]] as its [[central processing unit|CPU]]. Sierra was one of several similar projects being carried out in different Atari divisions, although they used different sound hardware.{{sfn|Goldberg|Vendel|2012|pp=725-745}}

By the time the AMY-1 was ready for production, Atari was in disarray. In July, [[Jack Tramiel]] bought Atari from [[Warner Communications]] and quickly dismantled the majority of Atari's engineering departments. The Sierra project quickly broke up.

===520ST===
Early news articles and development notes for the 520ST mention the AMY as its sound unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ii8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62 |title=I'm Going to Place My Bet on the Atari |first=John C. |last=Dvorak |magazine= InfoWorld |date= 14 October 1985 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the time it was released, the AMY had been replaced by the off-the-shelf [[General Instrument AY-3-8910|Yamaha YM2149]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=Practical Computing |date= 1985 |page=48 |title=Atari 520ST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===65XEM===
During this process, the Amy team persuaded them to adapt it for use in the [[Atari 8-bit family|8-bit machines]]. The result was the 65XEM, which combined the existing 65XE with the AMY. First shown publicly at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in January 1985, the XEM carried a premium $30 to $50 above the basic 65XE, which was also being launched at the same show. &lt;ref name=strike&gt;Tim Onosko and John Anderson, [http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v11n3/59_Atari_strikes_back_with_.php "Atari strikes back"], ''Creative Computing'', Volume 11 Number 3 (March 1985), pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the company's focus quickly shifted from the 8-bit line to the new [[Atari ST]]'s being launched at the same time, the XEM was shunted aside and never released commercially. A few prototypes were built, some of which later found their way into the hands of private collectors.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110913013745/http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8bits/xe/xe_protos/65xem.html "Atari 65XEM"], Atari Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sight &amp; Sound===
Tramiel later decided to sell off the technology, and reached an agreement with the Millwaukee-based company, Sight &amp; Sound. They developed a new version with 32 oscillators, along with a rack-mount [[MIDI]] synthesizer based on it. However, as they were preparing to ship the product, Atari threatened to sue them, and the system never shipped.&lt;ref name=amy/&gt;

[[File:Republic F-105B with avionics layout 060831-F-1234S-046.jpg|thumb|right|[[Republic F-105 Thunderchief|F&amp;#8209;105 Thunderchief]] with avionics laid out]] 

'''Avionics''' are the [[Electronics|electronic]] systems used on aircraft, [[artificial satellite]]s, and [[spacecraft]]. Avionic systems include communications, navigation, the display and management of multiple systems, and the hundreds of systems that are fitted to aircraft to perform individual functions. These can be as simple as a [[searchlight]] for a [[police helicopter]] or as complicated as the tactical system for an [[airborne early warning]] platform. The term ''avionics'' is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''aviation'' and ''electronics''.

==History==

The term "'''avionics'''" was coined by the journalist [[Philip J. Klass]] as a [[portmanteau]] of "'''aviation electronics'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGough |first=Michael |url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-08-26/ |title=In Memoriam: Philip J. Klass: A UFO (Ufologist Friend’s Obituary) | date = August 26, 2005 |publisher=Skeptic |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Robert. "'Unexplained Cases'–Only If You Ignore All Explanations", ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', March/April 2011, page 58&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern avionics have their origins in [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] wartime developments. For example, [[autopilot]] systems that are commonplace today began as specialized systems to help bomber planes fly steadily enough to hit precision targets from high altitudes.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Famously, radar was developed in the UK, Germany, and the United States during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Most Secret War | author = [[Reginald Victor Jones]] | isbn = 978-1-85326-699-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern avionics is a substantial portion of military aircraft spending. Aircraft like the [[F-15E|F&amp;#8209;15E]] and the now retired [[F-14|F&amp;#8209;14]] have roughly 20 percent of their budget spent on avionics. Most modern [[helicopter]]s now have budget splits of 60/40 in favour of avionics. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The civilian market has also seen a growth in cost of avionics. Flight control systems ([[fly-by-wire]]) and new navigation needs brought on by tighter airspaces, have pushed up development costs. The major change has been the recent boom in consumer flying. As more people begin to use planes as their primary method of transportation, more elaborate methods of controlling aircraft safely in these high restrictive airspaces have been invented.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Modern avionics===
Avionics plays a heavy role in modernization initiatives like the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s (FAA) [[Next Generation Air Transportation System]] project in the United States and the [[Single European Sky ATM Research]] (SESAR) initiative in Europe. The [[Joint Planning and Development Office]] put forth a roadmap for avionics in six areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Market===

The [[Aircraft Electronics Association]] reports $1.73 billion avionics sales for the first three quarters of 2017 in [[Business aviation|business]] and [[general aviation]], a 4.1% yearly improvement: 73.5% came from North America, forward-fit represented 42.3% while 57.7% were [[retrofit]]s as the U.S. deadline of Jan. 1, 2020 for mandatory [[ADS-B]] out approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2017-11-20/aea-retrofits-lift-avionics-sales-through-3q |title= AEA: Retrofits Lift Avionics Sales through 3Q |author= Chad Trautvetter |date= November 20, 2017 |work= AIN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft avionics==
The cockpit of an aircraft is a typical location for avionic equipment, including control, monitoring, communication, navigation, weather, and anti-collision systems. The majority of aircraft power their avionics using 14- or 28‑volt [[direct current|DC]] electrical systems; however, larger, more sophisticated aircraft (such as [[airliner]]s or military combat aircraft) have [[alternating current|AC]] systems operating at 400&amp;nbsp;Hz, 115 volts AC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/electronics/q0219.shtml 400 Hz Electrical Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; There are several major vendors of flight avionics, including [[Panasonic Avionics Corporation]], [[Honeywell Aerospace|Honeywell]] (which now owns [[Bendix Aviation|Bendix/King]]), [[Universal Avionics Systems Corporation]], [[Rockwell Collins]], [[Thales Group]], [[GE Aviation Systems]], [[Garmin]], [[Raytheon]], [[Parker Hannifin]], [[UTC Aerospace Systems]] and [[Avidyne Corporation]].

International standards for avionics equipment are prepared by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) and published by ARINC.

===Communications===

Communications connect the flight deck to the ground and the flight deck to the passengers. On‑board communications are provided by public-address systems and aircraft intercoms.

The VHF aviation communication system works on the [[airband]] of 118.000&amp;nbsp;MHz to 136.975&amp;nbsp;MHz. Each channel is spaced from the adjacent ones by 8.33&amp;nbsp;kHz in Europe, 25&amp;nbsp;kHz elsewhere. VHF is also used for line of sight communication such as aircraft-to-aircraft and aircraft-to-ATC. [[Amplitude modulation]] (AM) is used, and the conversation is performed in [[Simplex communication|simplex]] mode.  Aircraft communication can also take place using HF (especially for trans-oceanic flights) or satellite communication.

{{see also|Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System}}

===Navigation===

{{main|Air navigation}}
[[Air navigation]] is the determination of position and direction on or above the surface of the Earth. Avionics can use [[satellite navigation]] systems (such as [[GPS]] and [[WAAS]]), INS( inertial navigation system), ground-based [[radio navigation]] systems (such as [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] or [[LORAN]]), or any combination thereof. Navigation systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays. Older avionics required a pilot or navigator to plot the intersection of signals on a paper map to determine an aircraft's location; modern systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays.

===Monitoring===

{{main|Glass cockpit}}
[[File:Airbus A380 cockpit.jpg|thumb|The Airbus A380 glass cockpit featuring pull-out keyboards and two wide computer screens on the sides for pilots.]] The first hints of [[glass cockpit]]s emerged in the 1970s when flight-worthy [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) screens began to replace electromechanical displays, gauges and instruments. A "glass" cockpit refers to the use of computer monitors instead of gauges and other analog displays. Aircraft were getting progressively more displays, dials and information dashboards that eventually competed for space and pilot attention. In the 1970s, the average aircraft had more than 100 cockpit instruments and controls.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;''Avionics: Development and Implementation'' by Cary R. Spitzer (Hardcover – December 15, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass cockpits started to come into being with the [[Gulfstream Aerospace|Gulfstream]] G‑IV private jet in 1985. One of the key challenges in glass cockpits is to balance how much control is automated and how much the pilot should do manually. Generally they try to automate flight operations while keeping the pilot constantly informed.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt;

===Aircraft flight-control system===

{{main|Aircraft flight control system}}
Aircraft have means of automatically controlling flight. [[Autopilot]] was first invented by [[Lawrence Sperry]] during [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] to fly bomber planes steady enough to hit accurate targets from 25,000 feet. When it was first adopted by the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;military]], a [[Honeywell Aerospace|Honeywell]] engineer sat in the back seat with bolt cutters to disconnect the autopilot in case of emergency. Nowadays most commercial planes are equipped with aircraft flight control systems in order to reduce pilot error and workload at landing or takeoff.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;By Jeffrey L. Rodengen. {{ISBN|0-945903-25-1}}. Published by Write Stuff Syndicate, Inc. in 1995. "The Legend of Honeywell."&lt;/ref&gt;

The first simple commercial auto-pilots were used to control [[Aircraft heading|heading]] and altitude and had limited authority on things like [[thrust]] and [[flight control]] surfaces. In [[helicopter]]s, auto-stabilization was used in a similar way. The first systems were electromechanical. The advent of [[fly by wire]] and electro-actuated flight surfaces (rather than the traditional hydraulic) has increased safety. As with displays and instruments, critical devices that were electro-mechanical had a finite life. With safety critical systems, the software is very strictly tested.

===Collision-avoidance systems===

{{main|Aircraft collision avoidance systems}}
To supplement [[air traffic control]], most large transport aircraft and many smaller ones use a [[TCAS|traffic alert and collision avoidance system]] (TCAS), which can detect the location of nearby aircraft, and provide instructions for avoiding a midair collision. Smaller aircraft may use simpler traffic alerting systems such as TPAS, which are passive (they do not actively interrogate the [[transponder]]s of other aircraft) and do not provide advisories for conflict resolution.

To help avoid controlled flight into terrain ([[CFIT]]), aircraft use systems such as [[GPWS|ground-proximity warning systems]] (GPWS), which use radar altimeters as a key element. One of the major weaknesses of GPWS is the lack of "look-ahead" information, because it only provides altitude above terrain "look-down". In order to overcome this weakness, modern aircraft use a terrain awareness warning system ([[TAWS]]).

===Flight recorders===
{{Main|Flight recorder}}

Commercial aircraft cockpit data recorders, commonly known as "black boxes", store flight information and audio from the [[cockpit]]. They are often recovered from an aircraft after a crash to determine control settings and other parameters during the incident.

===Weather systems===
{{main|Weather radar|Lightning detector}}
Weather systems such as [[weather radar]] (typically [[Arinc&amp;nbsp;708]] on commercial aircraft) and [[lightning detector]]s are important for aircraft flying at night or in [[instrument meteorological conditions]], where it is not possible for pilots to see the weather ahead.  Heavy precipitation (as sensed by radar) or severe [[Clear-air turbulence|turbulence]] (as sensed by lightning activity) are both indications of strong convective activity and severe turbulence, and weather systems allow pilots to deviate around these areas.

Lightning detectors like the Stormscope or Strikefinder have become inexpensive enough that they are practical for light aircraft. In addition to radar and lightning detection, observations and extended radar pictures (such as [[NEXRAD]]) are now available through satellite data connections, allowing pilots to see weather conditions far beyond the range of their own in-flight systems. Modern displays allow weather information to be integrated with moving maps, terrain, and traffic onto a single screen, greatly simplifying navigation.

Modern weather systems also include [[wind shear]] and turbulence detection and terrain and traffic warning systems.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite news

===Aircraft management systems===
There has been a progression towards centralized control of the multiple complex systems fitted to aircraft, including engine monitoring and management. [[Health and usage monitoring systems]] (HUMS) are integrated with aircraft management computers to give maintainers early warnings of parts that will need replacement.

The [[integrated modular avionics]] concept proposes an integrated architecture with application software portable across an assembly of common hardware modules. It has been used in [[fourth generation jet fighter]]s and the latest generation of [[airliner]]s.

==Mission or tactical avionics==
[[Military aircraft]] have been designed either to deliver a weapon or to be the eyes and ears of other weapon systems. The vast array of sensors available to the military is used for whatever tactical means required. As with aircraft management, the bigger sensor platforms (like the E‑3D, JSTARS, ASTOR, Nimrod MRA4, Merlin HM Mk 1) have mission-management computers.

Police and EMS aircraft also carry sophisticated tactical sensors.

===Military communications===

While aircraft communications provide the backbone for safe flight, the tactical systems are designed to withstand the rigors of the battle field. [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]], [[Very high frequency|VHF]] Tactical (30–88&amp;nbsp;MHz) and SatCom systems combined with [[Electronic counter-countermeasures|ECCM]] methods, and [[cryptography]] secure the communications. Data links such as [[Link 11]], [[Link 16|16]], [[Link 22|22]] and [[Bowman (communications system)|BOWMAN]], [[JTRS]] and even [[TETRA]] provide the means of transmitting data (such as images, targeting information etc.).

===Radar===

Airborne [[radar]] was one of the first tactical sensors. The benefit of altitude providing range has meant a significant focus on airborne radar technologies. Radars include [[airborne early warning]] (AEW), [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW), and even [[weather radar]] ([[Arinc 708]]) and ground tracking/proximity radar.

The military uses [[Terrain-following radar|radar in fast jets to help pilots fly at low levels]]. While the civil market has had weather radar for a while, there are strict rules about using it to navigate the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://avionics.askdefine.com|title=Define avionics {{!}} Dictionary and Thesaurus|website=avionics.askdefine.com|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sonar===

Dipping sonar fitted to a range of military helicopters allows the [[helicopter]] to protect shipping assets from submarines or surface threats. Maritime support aircraft can drop active and passive sonar devices ([[sonobuoy]]s) and these are also used to determine the location of enemy submarines.

===Electro-Optics===
Electro-optic systems include devices such as the [[head-up display]] (HUD), [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR), [[infra-red search and track]] and other passive infrared devices ([[Passive infrared sensor]]). These are all used to provide imagery and information to the flight crew. This imagery is used for everything from search and rescue to [[navigational aid]]s and [[target acquisition]].

===ESM/DAS===

Electronic support measures and defensive aids are used extensively to gather information about threats or possible threats. They can be used to launch devices (in some cases automatically) to counter direct threats against the aircraft. They are also used to determine the state of a threat and identify it.

===Aircraft networks===
The avionics systems in military, commercial and advanced models of civilian aircraft are interconnected using an avionics databus. Common avionics databus protocols, with their primary application, include:
* [[Aircraft Data Network]] ([[Aircraft Data Network|ADN]]): Ethernet derivative for Commercial Aircraft
* [[AFDX|Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX)]]: Specific implementation of ARINC 664 ([[Aircraft Data Network|ADN]]) for Commercial Aircraft

[[File:Bellows (PSF).svg|thumb|Diagram of a [[fireplace]] hand-bellows.]]
A '''bellows''' or '''pair of bellows''' is a device constructed to furnish a strong blast of [[air]]. The simplest type consists of a flexible bag comprising a pair of rigid boards with handles joined by flexible leather sides enclosing an approximately airtight cavity which can be expanded and contracted by operating the handles, and fitted with a [[Check valve|valve]] allowing air to fill the cavity when expanded, and with a tube through which the air is forced out in a stream when the cavity is compressed.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed: bellows]&lt;/ref&gt; It has many applications, in particular blowing on a fire to supply it with air.

[[File:English Bellows.jpg|right|130px|thumb | Hand-made English fireplace bellows]]

The term "bellows" is used by extension for a flexible bag whose volume can be changed by compression or expansion, but not used to deliver air. For example, the light-tight (but not airtight) bag allowing the distance between the [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and [[Photographic film|film]] of a folding photographic camera to be varied is called a [[Bellows (photography)|bellows]].

==Name==
[[File:Remscheid - Deutsches Werkzeugmuseum 06 ies.jpg|thumb|right|A preserved baker's bellows at ''Deutsches Werkzeugmuseum'' (German Tools Museum) at [[Remscheid]].]]
[[File:Harold with old bellows 1976.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Old bellows used on goldfield near [[Milparinka]], N.S.W., Australia. 1976.]]
"Bellows" is only used in plural. The [[Old English]] name for 'bellows' was blǽstbęl(i)g, blást-bęl(i)g 'blast-bag, blowing-bag'; the prefix was dropped and by the eleventh century the simple bęlg, bylg, bylig ('bag') was used. The word is [[cognate]] with "[[Abdomen|belly]]".&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; There are similar words in [[Old Norse]], Swedish, and Danish, but the derivation is not certain.  'Bellows' appears not to be cognate with the apparently similar Latin ''follis''.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

== Metallurgy ==
Several processes, such as metallurgical iron [[smelting]] and [[welding]], require so much heat that they could only be developed after the invention, in [[Ancient history|antiquity]], of the bellows. The bellows are used to deliver additional air to the fuel, raising the rate of combustion and therefore the heat output.

Various kinds of bellows are used in [[metallurgy]]:
* Box bellows were and are traditionally used in East Asia.
* Pot bellows were used in ancient Egypt.
* [[Tatara (furnace)|Tatara]] foot bellows from Japan.
* [[Accordion]] bellows, with the characteristic pleated sides, have been used in Europe for many centuries.
* Piston bellows were developed in the middle of the 18th century in Europe. However, the double action piston bellows were utilised by the Han Chinese in ancient China as early as the 3rd century BC.
* [[Metal bellows]] were made to absorb axial movement in a dynamic condition. Often referred to as Axial Dynamics bellows types.

The manufacturing of different alloys in China often required a continuous stream of air that was able to be blown over through molten metals. The use of double-action piston bellows was described by Chinese philosopher [[Lao Tzu]] around 500 BC to produce a continuous stream of air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Chronology of Science |last= Rezende |first= Lisa |publisher=Checkmark Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-0816071197 |publication-date=April 1, 2007 |pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Han Dynasty]] Chinese mechanical engineer [[Du Shi]] (d. 38) is credited with being the first to use double-action piston pumps to apply hydraulic power, through a [[waterwheel]], to operate bellows in metallurgy. His invention was used to operate piston bellows of blast furnaces in order to forge [[cast iron]].&lt;ref name="needhamj"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Part 2''. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd., p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Greeks]], [[ancient Romans]], and other civilizations used bellows in [[bloomery]] furnaces producing [[wrought iron]]. Bellows are also used to send pressurized air in a controlled manner in a fired heater. 

In modern industry, reciprocating bellows are usually replaced with motorized blowers.

===Double-acting piston bellows===
Double-acting piston bellows are a type of bellows used by [[blacksmith]]s and [[smelter]]s to increase the air flow going into the forge, with the property that air is blown out on both strokes of the handle (in contrast to simpler and more common bellows that blow air when the stroke is in one direction and refill the bellows in the other direction).  These bellows blow a more constant, and thus stronger, blast than simple bellows.&lt;ref name="craddock"&gt;Craddock, Paul T. ''Early Metal Mining and Production''. pp. 183-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Such bellows existed in [[China]] at least since the 5th century BC, when it was invented, and had reached Europe by the 16th century.&lt;ref name="temple-r"&gt;Temple, Robert K.G. (2007). ''The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention'' (3rd edition). London: André Deutsch, pp. 46-49. {{ISBN|978-0-233-00202-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Let There be Peace - Ascension to Ivisimara |last= O'Doherty |first= Mark |isbn=978-1291208917 |publication-date=November 24, 2012 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Future of Post-human History: A Preface to a New Theory of Universality and Relativity |last=Baofu |first=Peter |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=978-1443837682 |publication-date=May 1, 2012 |pages=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 240 BC, The ancient Greek inventor [[Ctesibius]] of Alexandria independently invented a double-action piston bellow used to lift water from one level to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=World Energy Crisis: A Reference Handbook |last=E. Newton |first=David |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2012 |isbn=978-1610691475 |publication-date=November 5, 2012 |pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A piston is enclosed in a rectangular box with a handle coming out one side.   The [[piston]] edges are covered with feathers, fur, or soft paper to ensure that it is [[Seal (mechanical)|airtight]] and [[lubrication|lubricated]]. As the piston is pulled, air from one side enters and flows through the nozzle and as it is pushed air enters from the opposite side and flows through the same nozzle.&lt;ref name="craddock"/&gt;

===Double-lung accordion bellows===
These have three leaves. The middle leaf is fixed in place. The bottom leaf is moved up and down. The top leaf can move freely and has a weight on it. The bottom and the middle leaves contain valves, the top one does not. Only the top lung is connected to the spout.

When the bottom leaf is moved up, air is pumped from the bottom lung into the top lung. At the same time air is leaving the bellows from the top lung through the spout, but at a slower rate. This inflates the top lung. Next the bottom leaf is moved down to pull fresh air into the bellows. While this happens the weight on the top leaf pushes it down, so air keeps leaving through the spout.

This design does not increase the amount of air flow going into the forge, but provides a more constant air flow compared to a simple bellows. It also provides more even air flow than two simple bellows pumped alternately or one double-acting piston bellows.

== Further applications ==
===Fluid transfer applications===
*Bellows are used extensively in hydraulic power circuits and cooling loops.
*They are an essential part of [[anesthesia machine]]s.
*Bellows [[PTFE]] with cone and socket for [[ground glass joint]]s.
*[[Cuckoo clock]]s use bellows to blow air through their [[gedackt]] (pipes) and imitate the call of the Common Cuckoo bird.
*[[Musical instrument]]s may employ bellows as a substitute or regulator for air pressure provided by the human [[lung]]s:
**[[Melodeon (accordion)|melodeon]], [[concertina]] and related instruments
**[[Reed organ]]
**[[Pipe organ]]
**[[Musette de cour]] and some other varieties of [[bagpipes]]
**[[Pump organ|Harmonium]] and [[Melodeon (organ)|melodeon]]
**[[Portative organ|Portative]]

===Expansion joint applications===
The term "bellows" is used by extension for a number of applications that do not involve air transfer.
*Bellows are widely used in industrial and mechanical applications such as rod boots, machinery way covers, lift covers and rail covers to protect rods, bearings and seals from dirt.
*Bellows are widely used on [[articulated buses]] and [[trams]], to cover the joint where the vehicle bends.
*Bellows are used in mechanical aneroids by acting as a precision indicator of pressure levels based on their lateral movement.
*Bellows tubing, a type of lightweight, flexible, extensible tubing may be used for delivery of gas or air at near-ambient pressure, as in early [[aqua-lung]] designs.
*[[Folding camera|Folding]] and [[view camera]]s use bellows to exclude light while allowing the lens to be moved relative to the film plane for focusing and, mainly in view cameras, to allow the lens to slide and tilt to control the image ([[View camera#Movements|camera movements]]).
*Piping [[expansion joint]]: In this application, bellows are formed in series to absorb thermal movement and vibration in piping systems that transport high temperature media such as exhaust gases or steam.

'''Cleaning cards''' are [[disposable product]]s designed to clean the interior contact points of a device that facilitates an electronic information transaction ([[point of sale]] terminal, [[Automated Teller Machine|automated teller machine]], [[remote deposit]] check scanners, micr readers, [[magnetic stripe reader]], [[bill acceptor]], [[bill validator]], [[access control]] locks, etc.). In order for the cleaning card to work properly in the device, the card resembles or mimics the material of the transaction media – such as a credit card, check, or currency. As the cleaning card is inserted and passed through the device, it will clean components that would normally come in contact with the transaction media such as readers, lenses, read/write chip and pins, belts, rollers, and paths. Cleaning card products are widely accepted and endorsed by device manufacturers and industry professionals. Many have developed their own cleaning cards to better clean their particular devices.

A typical cleaning card is much like a wiper or sponge that can get into areas that are not readily accessible. Typically, the cleaning card has a solid core covered by a soft wipe-like material. The product is then saturated with a cleaning solution recommended by the device manufacturer and then placed in a sealed pouch to maintain the saturation level and cleanliness of the card.

== Invention and Evolution ==
The cleaning card was originally [[Patent|patented]] by [[Stanley H. Eyler]] and the patent ([[US#5525417 A]]) was assigned to his employer, the [[Clean Team Company]]. The Clean Team Company later changed its name to KICTeam, Inc., which continues to be the leading manufacturer of cleaning cards. The cleaning card has evolved with the equipment they need to clean. A good example is the bill acceptor. Initially, the [[bill acceptor]] was designed for [[vending machines]] as a means of selling [[candy]] to the public. It includes a device that recognizes that a US one dollar bank note has been inserted. The cleaning card was required to be the same shape as US currency in order to be accepted into the device to clean it. Vending machines began accepting higher denominations as well as having the ability to make change. Specialized sensors were introduced into the bill acceptors to recognize multiple denominations and to only accept media that contained bank note characteristics. The bill acceptor cleaning card was redeveloped to contain [[magnetic ink]] and bank note characteristics so as to be accepted by the equipment. The development of bill acceptors for [[slot machines]] in the gaming and casino industry required the bill acceptor to be more sophisticated. The [[bill validators]] needed to validate currency of multiple denominations up to a one hundred dollar bank note. Fraud was now a critical issue and was addressed by multiple sensors and optics throughout the inserted currency pathway. These sensors and optics were recessed so as to keep currency from running across them with each insertion and wearing down sensitive lenses.

== Area of application ==
Cleaning cards are used in the gaming, wagering, vending, hotel, retail, lottery, petroleum, manufacturing, shipping, auto id, card printing, banking.  For example, this includes all places that credit cards or cash are inserted into a machine to make payments.

=== Cleaning of the magnetic head ===
The magnetic head inside the [[POS Terminal]] is a fixed component and for this reason it only can be cleared by cleaning cards that are flexible enough to clean the leading, center and trailing edges of this round reader head. The cleaning of the magnetic head is very important because it's responsible for the reading of the card and so it decides acceptance or rejection of the inserted card.
The cleaning card is not only cleaning the reading area of the magnetic head which is cleared. There is also a cleaning process within the device along the card path. The cleaning in these high dirt build-up areas is especially important and ensures efficient cleaning of the card reader.

=== Cleaning of chip reading contacts ===
Chip Cards are also known as Smart Cards and [[EMV]] Cards. There are two different types of EMV card readers - friction and landing. Contaminated contacts can result in rejection of the inserted payment or authorization card. The cleaning card with ensures optimal cleaning of chip reading contacts.

=== Cleaning of motorized card readers ===
Motorized readers are built in, for example [[Automated Teller Machine|ATM]]s. The credit/debit-card is inserted into the card slot, where the first magnetic head is placed. If a magnetic stripe can be recognized, a shutter will be opened and the card will be transported to the second magnetic head by roles. The card is read, thereby the device knows whether the transaction goes over the micro chip or the magnetic stripe. If no micro chip is placed on the card, the transaction goes directly above the magnetic head. If the data gives the order for a transaction over the micro chip, the card is placed on the chip reading contact and is stopped. The chip contacts, are fitted on the chip and now the transaction begins. If the reading of the magnetic stripe respectively by the micro chip is not possible, the card will be declined.
A cleaning card for a motorized card reader will need a magnetic stripe built into it to activate the acceptance shutter.

=== Cleaning of check and document scanners ===
Check scanners are used by banks or business through [[remote deposit capture]] programs to take a digital image of the check and send the information to the bank for deposit. This is where the image of a check on your [[bank statement]] originates. If a check scanner is not properly cleaned financial institutions risk increased transaction failures, equipment malfunctions, personnel costs to reconcile poor images, equipment repair or exchange and non-compliance due to poor image quality. A cleaning card designed to clean a specific model of check scanner is run through the device the same way the operator would run a check through the device. The cleaning card makes contact with the optical lenses, micr reader, transport belts and rollers, print heads and clears the check path.

== Transactions Terminology ==
Transactions are any action that has a monetary implication or transfer information from one media to another. The most commonly thought of transactions are the use of credit or debit cards through a [[card reader]] of some type. Card readers are also widely used for hotel door locks or access control devices. Another of the most common is a currency transaction via [[vending]], [[slot machines]], or [[self-checkout]] kiosk where a [[bill acceptor]] takes currency or a [[currency detector]] tabulates quantity. Many printers are transaction devices such as cashless ticket printers in the gaming industry.

[[Image:Detonator.jpg|thumb|250px|Top: small [[nonel]] detonator with 2 ms delay for chaining nonel tubes; middle: class B SPD detonator; bottom: class C SPD detonator]]
[[Image:Eod2.jpg|250px|thumb|Inserting detonators into blocks of [[C-4 explosive]]]]

A '''detonator''', frequently a '''blasting cap''', is a device used to [[detonation|trigger]] an [[explosive device]]. Detonators can be chemically, mechanically, or electrically initiated, the latter two being the most common.

The commercial use of explosives uses electrical detonators or the capped fuse which is a length of safety [[fuse (explosives)|fuse]] to which an ordinary detonator has been [[crimp (joining)|crimp]]ed. Many detonators' [[primary explosive]] is a material called ASA compound. This compound is formed from [[lead azide]], [[lead styphnate]] and [[aluminium]] and is pressed into place above the base charge, usually [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] or [[tetryl]] in military detonators and [[PETN]] in commercial detonators.

Other materials such as DDNP ([[diazo dinitro phenol]]) are also used as the primary charge to reduce the amount of lead emitted into the atmosphere by [[mining]] and [[quarry]]ing operations. Old detonators used [[mercury fulminate]] as the primary, often mixed with [[potassium chlorate]] to yield better performance.

A '''blasting cap''' is a small [[sensitivity (explosives)|sensitive]] [[primary explosive]] device generally used to detonate a larger, more powerful and less sensitive [[secondary explosive]] such as [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[dynamite]], or [[plastic explosive]].

Blasting caps come in a variety of types, including non-electric caps, electric caps, and fuse caps. They are used in commercial [[mining]], excavation, and [[demolition]].  Electric types are set off by a short burst of current conducted from a [[blasting machine]] by a long wire to the cap to ensure safety.  Traditional fuse caps have a [[fuse (explosive)|fuse]] which is ignited by a flame source, such as a match or a lighter.

==Need for detonators==
The need for detonators such as blasting caps came from the development of safer explosives.  Different explosives require different amounts of energy (their [[activation energy]]) to detonate.  Most commercial explosives are formulated with a high activation energy, to make them stable and safe to handle so they will not explode if accidentally dropped, mishandled, or exposed to fire. These are called [[secondary explosive]]s.  However they are correspondingly difficult to detonate intentionally, and require a small initiating explosion.  This is provided by a detonator.

A detonator contains an easy-to-ignite [[primary explosive]] that provides the initial [[activation energy]] to start the detonation in the main charge. Explosives commonly used in detonators include [[mercury fulminate]], [[lead azide]], [[lead styphnate]], [[tetryl]], and [[Diazodinitrophenol|DDNP]].  Blasting caps and some detonators are stored separately and not inserted into the main explosive charge until just before use, keeping the main charge safe.  
Early blasting caps also used silver fulminate, but it has been replaced with cheaper and safer primary explosives.
Silver azide is still used sometimes, but very rarely due to its high price.

Detonators are hazardous for untrained personnel to handle since they contain primary explosive.  They are sometimes not recognized as explosives due to their appearance, leading to injuries.

==Types==

===Ordinary detonators===
Ordinary detonators usually take the form of ignition-based explosives. While  they are mainly used in commercial operations, ordinary detonators are still used in military operations. This form of detonator is most commonly initiated using [[safety fuse]], and used in non time-critical detonations e.g. [[Bomb disposal#UXO|conventional munitions disposal]]. Well known detonators are [[Lead(II) azide|lead azide]], Pb(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[silver azide]] (AgN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]] [Hg(ONC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;].

===Electrical detonators===
There are three categories of electrical detonators: '''instantaneous electrical detonators''' ('''IED'''), '''short period delay detonators''' ('''SPD''') and '''long period delay detonators''' ('''LPD'''). SPDs are measured in milliseconds and LPDs are measured in seconds. In situations where nanosecond accuracy is required, specifically in the implosion charges in [[nuclear weapon]]s, [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s are employed. The initial shock wave is created by vaporizing a length of a thin wire by an [[electric discharge]]. A new development is a [[slapper detonator]], which uses thin plates accelerated by an electrically exploded wire or foil to deliver the initial shock. It is in use in some modern weapon systems. A variant of this concept is used in mining operations, when the foil is exploded by a [[laser]] pulse delivered to the foil by [[optical fiber]].

===Non-electric detonators===
A non-electric detonator is a shock tube detonator designed to initiate explosions, generally for the purpose of demolition of buildings and for use in the blasting of rock in mines and quarries. Instead of electric wires, a hollow plastic tube delivers the firing impulse to the detonator, making it immune to most of the hazards associated with stray electric current. It consists of a small diameter, three-layer plastic tube coated on the innermost wall with a reactive explosive compound, which, when ignited, propagates a low energy signal, similar to a dust explosion. The reaction travels at approximately 6,500&amp;nbsp;ft/s (2,000&amp;nbsp;m/s) along the length of the tubing with minimal disturbance outside of the tube. The design of non-electric detonators incorporates patented technology, including the Cushion Disk (CD) and Delay Ignition Buffer (DIB) to provide reliability and accuracy in all blasting applications.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Non-electric detonators was invented by the Swedish company Nitro Nobel in the 1960s and 1970s, under the leadership of Per-Anders Persson, and launched to the demolitions market in 1973. (Nitro Nobel became a part of Dyno Nobel after being sold to Norwegian Dyno Industrier AS in 1986.) Nonel is a contraction of "Non-electric detonators".

===Electronic detonators===
In civil mining, electronic detonators  have a better precision for delays. Electronic detonators are designed to provide the precise control necessary to produce accurate and consistent blasting results in a variety of blasting applications in the mining, quarrying, and construction industries. Electronic detonators may be programmed in 1-millisecond increments from 1 millisecond to 10,000 milliseconds using the dedicated programming device called the logger.

Benefits:

* 100% verification of reliability of connections in initiation network.
* Delay range of 1–10,000 ms with an increment of 1 ms. DigiShot delay range is up to 20,000 ms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detnet.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=90|title=DetNet South Africa - Excellence in Mining Electronic Initiation|author=|date=|website=DetNet|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Precision of 0.01% of nominal delay time.
* Safe and reliable initiation of up to 1600 units in one blast per one blasting machine.
* Unique ID in each detonator.
* Multiple verification of detonators prior each blast.

==Types of blasting caps==
[[File:Cutaway diagram of various types of blasting caps and detonators.svg|right|400px]]

===Pyrotechnic fuse blasting cap===
The oldest and simplest type of cap, fuse caps are a metal cylinder, closed at one end.  From the open end inwards, there is first an empty space into which a pyrotechnic [[fuse (explosive)|fuse]] is inserted and crimped, then a pyrotechnic ignition mix, a [[primary explosive]], and then the main detonating explosive charge.

The primary hazard of pyrotechnic blasting caps is that for proper usage, the fuse must be inserted and then crimped into place by crushing the base of the cap around the fuse.  If the tool used to crimp the cap is used too close to the explosives, the primary explosive compound can detonate during crimping.  A common hazardous practice is crimping caps with one's teeth; an accidental detonation can cause serious injury to the mouth.

Fuse type blasting caps are still in active use today.  They are the safest type to use around certain types of electromagnetic interference, and they have a built in time delay as the fuse burns down.

===Solid pack electric blasting cap===
Solid pack electric blasting caps use a thin [[bridgewire]] in direct contact (hence solid pack) with a primary explosive, which is heated by electric current and causes the detonation of the primary explosive.  That primary explosive then detonates a larger charge of secondary explosive.

Some solid pack fuses incorporate a small pyrotechnic delay element, up to a few hundred milliseconds, before the cap fires.

===Match or fusehead electric blasting cap===
Match type blasting caps use an [[electric match]] (insulating sheet with electrodes on both sides, a thin bridgewire soldered across the sides, all dipped in ignition and output mixes) to initiate the primary explosive, rather than direct contact between the bridgewire and the primary explosive.  The match can be manufactured separately from the rest of the cap and only assembled at the end of the process.

Match type caps are now the most common type found worldwide.

===Exploding bridgewire detonator or blasting cap===
{{Main|Exploding-bridgewire detonator}}

This type of detonator was invented in the 1940s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]] to develop nuclear weapons.  The design goal was to produce a detonator which acted very rapidly and predictably.  Both Match and Solid Pack type electric caps take a few milliseconds to fire, as the bridgewire heats up and heats the explosive to the point of detonation.  Explosive bridgewire or '''EBW''' detonators use a higher voltage electric charge and a very thin bridgewire, .04 inch long, .0016 diameter, (1&amp;nbsp;mm long, 0.04&amp;nbsp;mm diameter).  Instead of heating up the explosive, the EBW detonator wire is heated so quickly by the high firing current that the wire actually vaporizes and explodes due to electric resistance heating.  That electrically driven explosion then fires the detonator's initiator explosive (usually [[PETN]]).

Some similar detonators use a thin metal foil instead of a wire, but operate in the same manner as true bridgewire detonators.

In addition to firing very quickly when properly activated, EBW detonators are safe from stray static electricity and other electric current.  Enough current and the bridgewire may melt, but it is small enough that it cannot detonate the initiator explosive unless the full high-voltage high-current charge passes through the bridgewire.  EBW detonators are used in many civilian applications where radio signals, static electricity, or other electrical hazards might cause accidents with conventional electric detonators.

===Slapper detonator or blasting cap===
{{Main|Slapper detonator}}

Slapper detonators are an improvement on EBW detonators.  Slappers, instead of directly using the exploding foil to detonate the initiator explosive, use the electrical vaporization of the foil to drive a small circle of insulating material such as [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] or [[kapton]] down a circular hole in an additional disc of insulating material.  At the far end of that hole is a pellet of conventional initiator explosive.

The conversion efficiency of energy from electricity into kinetic energy of the flying disk or slapper can be 20–40%.

Since the slapper impacts a wide area, 40 thousandths or (roughly one mm across) of the explosive, rather than a thin line or point as in an exploding foil or bridgewire detonator, the detonation is more regular and requires less energy.  Reliable detonation requires raising a minimum volume of explosive to temperatures and pressures at which detonation starts.  If energy is deposited at a single point, it can radiate away in the explosive in all directions in rarefaction or expansion waves, and only a small volume is efficiently heated or compressed.  The flier disc loses impact energy at its sides to rarefaction waves, but a conical volume of explosive is efficiently shock compressed.

Slapper detonators are used in [[nuclear weapons]]. These components require large quantities of energy to initiate, making them extremely unlikely to accidentally discharge.

===Laser ordnance initiators===
In this type, a pulse from a [[laser]] passes down an [[optical fiber]] to strike and thus initiate a carbon-doped explosive. These initiators are highly reliable. Unintentional initiation is very difficult as the explosive can only be detonated by the attached laser, which is precisely tuned to do so, or a completely independent laser that matches.

==History==
The first blasting cap or detonator was demonstrated in 1745 when British physician and apothecary [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|F.R.S.]], showed that the [[electric spark]] of a [[Electrostatic generator#Friction machines|friction machine]] could ignite black powder, by way of igniting a flammable substance mixed in with the black powder.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, William (1745) [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/204890#page/639/mode/1up "Experiments and observations tending to illustrate the nature and properties of electricity,"] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''43''' :  481–501.  [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/204890#page/658/mode/1up From p. 500:]  "But I can, at pleasure, fire gunpowder, and even discharge a musket, by the power of electricity, when the gunpowder has been ground with a little camphor, or with a few drops of some inflammable chemical oil."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1750, [[Benjamin Franklin]] in Philadelphia made a commercial blasting cap consisting of a paper tube full of [[black powder]], with wires leading in both sides and wadding sealing up the ends.  The two wires came close but did not touch, so a large electric spark discharge between the two wires would fire the cap.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin, ''Experiments and Observations on Electricity at Philadelphia in America'' … (London, England:  Francis Newberg, 1769), p. 92.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=-48_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false From p. 92:]  "A small cartridge is filled with dry powder, hard rammed, so as to bruise some of the grains; two pointed wires are then thrust in, one at each end, the points approaching each other in the middle of the cartridge till within the distance of half an inch [1.27 cm]; then, the cartridge being placed in the circle [i.e., circuit], when the four [[Leyden jar | [Leyden] jars]] are discharged, the electric flame leaping from the point of one wire to the point of the other, within the cartridge amongst the powder, ''fires it'', and the explosion of the powder is at the same instant with the crack of the discharge."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832, a hot wire detonator was produced by American chemist [[Robert Hare (chemist)|Robert Hare]], although attempts along similar lines had earlier been attempted by the Italians Volta and Cavallo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standingwellback.com/home/2012/11/18/inventing-detonators.html|title=Standing Well Back - Home - Inventing detonators|author=|date=|website=www.standingwellback.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hare constructed his blasting cap by passing a multistrand wire through a charge of gunpowder inside a tin tube; he had cut all but one fine strand of the multistrand wire so that the fine strand would serve as the hot bridgewire.  When a strong current from a large battery (which he called a "deflagrator" or "calorimotor") was passed through the fine strand, it became incandescent and ignited the charge of gunpowder.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, Robert (1832) [https://books.google.com/books?id=kAoAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA266#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Application of galvanism to the blasting of rocks,"] ''The Mechanics' Magazine'', … , '''17''' :  266–267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note:  Robert Hare had constructed his large battery (or "deflagrator" or "calorimotor", as he called it) in 1821.  See:  Hare, R. (1821) [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/51988#page/115/mode/1up "A memoir on some new modifications of galvanic apparatus, with observations in support of his new theory of galvanism,"] ''The American Journal of Science and Arts'', '''3''' :  105–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863, [[Alfred Nobel]] realized that although nitroglycerin could not be detonated by a fuse, it could be detonated by the explosion of a small charge of gunpowder, which in turn was ignited by a fuse.&lt;ref&gt;Patent for nitroglycerin:  Nobel, A., British patent no. 1,813 (July 20, 1864).&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a year, he was adding [[mercury fulminate]] to the gunpowder charges of his detonators, and by 1867 he was using small copper capsules of mercury fulminate, triggered by a fuse, to detonate nitroglycerin.&lt;ref&gt;See:

In 1868, Henry Julius Smith of Boston, Massachusetts, introduced a cap that combined a spark gap ignitor and mercury fulminate, the first electric cap able to detonate dynamite.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, H. Julius, [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=00079268&amp;PageNum=2&amp;IDKey=1204F9662960&amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526p=1%2526u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526d=PALL%2526S1=0079268.PN.%2526OS=PN/79268%2526RS=PN/79268 "Improvement in electric fuses,"] U.S. Patent no. 79,268 (June 23, 1868).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, H. Julius Smith—and then in 1887, Perry G. Gardner of North Adams, Massachusetts—developed electric detonators that combined a hot wire detonator with mercury fulminate explosive.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Paul W., ''Explosives Engineering'' (New York, New York:  Wiley-VHC, 1996), p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

Modern caps use different explosives and separate primary and secondary explosive charges, but are generally very similar to the Gardner and Smith caps.

H. Julius Smith also invented the first satisfactory [[blasting machine|portable power supply for igniting blasting caps]]:  a [[Ignition magneto|high-voltage magneto]] that was driven by a [[rack and pinion]], which in turn was driven by a T-handle that was pushed downwards.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Armstrong, [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/artl.2009.16.1.16101 Systems architecture: a new model for sustainability and the built environment using nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science with living technology], ''Artificial Life'', MIT Press, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2010, pp. 73-87.&lt;/ref&gt;
can loosely be defined as two-way direct communication or conversion between matter and information that enables people to exactly describe, monitor, manipulate and create any arbitrary real object. DM is a general [[paradigm]] alongside a specified framework that is suitable for computer processing and includes: holistic, coherent, volumetric modeling systems; symbolic languages that are able to handle infinite degrees of freedom and detail in a compact format; and the direct interaction and/or fabrication of any object at any spatial resolution without the need for “lossy” or intermediate formats.

''DM'' systems possess the following attributes:

* realistic - correct spatial mapping of matter to information
* exact - exact language and/or methods for input from and output to matter
* infinite - ability to operate at any scale and define infinite detail
* symbolic - accessible to individuals for design, creation and modification

Such an approach can not only be applied to tangible objects but can include the conversion of things such as light and sound to/from information and matter. Systems to digitally materialize light and sound already largely exist now (e.g. photo editing, audio mixing, etc.) and have been quite effective - but the representation, control and creation of tangible matter is poorly support by computational and digital systems.

Commonplace computer-aided design and manufacturing systems currently represent real objects as "2.5 dimensional" shells. In contrast, DM proposes a deeper understanding and sophisticated manipulation of matter by directly using rigorous mathematics as complete volumetric descriptions of real objects. By utilizing technologies such as [[Function representation]] (FRep) it becomes possible to compactly describe and understand the surface and internal structures or properties of an object at an infinite resolution. Thus models can accurately represent matter across all scales making it possible to capture the complexity and quality of natural and real objects and ideally suited for digital fabrication and other kinds of real world interactions. DM surpasses the previous limitations of static disassociated languages and simple human-made objects, to propose systems that are heterogeneous, interacting directly and more naturally with the complex world.&lt;ref&gt;T. Vilbrandt, E. Malone, H. Lipson, A. Pasko, Universal Desktop Fabrication, in ''Heterogeneous Objects Modelling and Applications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', vol. 4889, Springer Verlag, 2008, pp. 259-284&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital and computer-based languages and processes, unlike the analogue counterparts, can computationally and spatially describe and control matter in an exact, constructive and accessible manner. However, this requires approaches that can handle the complexity of natural objects and materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4947">[[Image:Roomcorrect-mag.png|right|thumb|An example of the frequency magnitude of a room response before and after digital room correction.]]

'''Digital room correction''' (or '''DRC''') is a process in the field of [[acoustics]] where digital filters designed to ameliorate unfavorable effects of a room's acoustics are applied to the input of a [[sound reproduction]] system.  Modern room correction systems produce substantial improvements in the  [[time domain]] and [[frequency domain]] response of the sound reproduction system.

== History ==
[[Image:Roomcorrect-phase.png|right|thumb|Digital room correction may involve [[minimum phase]] algorithms, to maintain wavefront coherence over the intended frequency range]]

The use of analog filters, such as [[equalization (audio)|equalizers]], to normalize the frequency response of a playback system has a long history; however, analog filters are very limited in their ability to correct the distortion found in many rooms. Although digital implementations of the equalizers have been available for some time, digital room correction is usually used to refer to the construction of filters which attempt to invert the [[impulse response]] of the room and playback system, at least in part. Digital correction systems are able to use [[anticausal system|acausal filters]], and are able to operate with optimal time resolution, optimal frequency resolution, or any desired compromise along the [[Gabor limit]]. Digital room correction is a fairly new area of study which has only recently been made possible by the computational power of modern [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] and [[Digital signal processors|DSPs]].

== Operation ==

The configuration of a digital room correction system begins with measuring the [[impulse response]] of the room at the listening location for each of the loudspeakers. Then, computer software is used to compute a [[Finite impulse response|FIR filter]], which reverses the effects of the room and linear distortion in the loudspeakers. Finally, the calculated filter is loaded into a computer or other room correction device which applies the filter in real time. Because most room correction filters are acausal, there is some delay. Most DRC systems allow the operator to control the added delay through configurable parameters.

== Challenges ==

DRC systems are not normally used to create a perfect inversion of the room's response because a perfect correction would only be valid at the location where it was measured: a few millimeters away the arrival times from various reflections will differ and the inversion will be imperfect. The imperfectly corrected signal may end up sounding worse than the uncorrected signal because the acausal filters used in digital room correction may cause [[pre-echo]]. Room correction filter calculation systems instead favor a [[wikt:robust|robust]] approach, and employ sophisticated processing to attempt to produce an inverse filter which will work over a usably large volume, and which avoid producing bad-sounding artifacts outside of that volume, at the expense of peak accuracy at the measurement location.

'''Drill pipe''', is hollow, thin-walled, steel or aluminium alloy [[pipe (material)|piping]] that is used on [[drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rigs]].  It is hollow to allow [[drilling fluid]] to be pumped down the hole through the bit and back up the [[annulus (oil well)|annulus]]. It comes in a variety of sizes, strengths, and wall thicknesses, but is typically 27 to 32 feet in length (Range 2). Longer lengths, up to 45 feet, exist (Range 3).

==Background==
Drill stems must be designed to transfer drilling torque for combined lengths that often exceed several miles down into the [[Earth's crust]], and also must be able to resist pressure differentials between inside and outside (or vice versa), and have sufficient strength to suspend the total weight of deeper components. For deep wells this requires tempered steel tubes that are expensive, and owners spend considerable efforts to reuse them after finishing a well. 

A used drill stem is inspected on site, or off location. [[Ultrasonic testing]] and modified instruments similar to the [[spherometer]] are used at inspection sites to identify defects from metal [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], in order to preclude [[fracture]] of the drill stem during future wellboring. Drill pipe is classed as new (N class), becoming premium (P-class) and finally down to C (C 1 to 3) as fatigue is accumulated and as the outside diameter is worn down by usage. Eventually the drill pipe will be graded as scrap and marked with a red band.

Drill pipe is a portion of the overall drill string. The drill string consists of both drill pipe and the [[bottom hole assembly]] (BHA), which is the tubular portion closest to the bit. The BHA will be made of thicker walled heavy weight drill pipe (HWDP) and drill collars, which have a larger outside diameter and provide weight to the drill bit and stiffness to the drilling assembly. Other BHA components can include a mud motor, measurement while drilling (MWD) apparatus, stabilizers, and various specialty downhole tools. The drill stem includes the entire drill string, plus the [[Kelly drive|kelly]] that imparts rotation and torque to the drill pipe at the top.

See [[Drilling rig (petroleum)]] for a diagram of a drilling rig.

==Manufacturing Process==
Modern drill pipe is made from the welding of at least three separate pieces: box tool joint, pin tool joint, and the tube. The green tubes are received by the drill pipe manufacturer from the steel mill. The ends of the tubes are then upset to increase the cross sectional area of the ends. The tube end may be externally upset (EU), internally upset (IU), or internally and externally upset (IEU). Standard max upset dimensions are specified in API 5DP, but the exact dimensions of the upset are proprietary to the manufacturer. After upsetting, the tube then goes through a heat treating process. Drill pipe steel is commonly quenched and tempered to achieve high yield strengths (135 ksi is a common tube yield strength).

The tool joints (connectors) are also received by the manufacturer as green tubes. After a quench and temper heat treat, the tool joints are cut into box (female) and pin (male) threads. Tool joints are commonly 120 ksi SMYS, rather than the 135 ksi of the tube. They generally are stiffer than the tube, increasing the likelihood of a fatigue failure at the junction. The lower SMYS on the connection increases the fatigue resistance. Higher strength steels are typically harder and more brittle, making them more susceptible to cracking and subsequent stress crack propagation.

Tubes and tool joints are welded using rotary inertia or [[direct drive]] [[friction welding]]. The tube is held stationary while the tool joint is revolved at high RPMs. The tool joint is the firmly pressed onto the upset end of the tube while the tool joint is rotating. The heat and force during this interaction weld the two together. Once the "ram horns" or excess material is removed, the weld line can only be seen under a microscope. Inertia friction welding is the traditional proven method. Direct drive friction welding is controlled and monitored up to 1000 times a second, resulting in a fine quality weld that does not necessary need a full heat treat quench and temper regime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2366">'''Dual control theory''' is a branch of [[control theory]] that deals with the control of systems whose characteristics are initially unknown.  It is called ''dual'' because in controlling such a system the controller's objectives are twofold: 
* (1) '''Action''': To control the system as well as possible based on current system knowledge
* (2) '''Investigation''': To experiment with the system so as to learn about its behavior and control it better in the future.
These two objectives may be partly in conflict.

Dual control theory was developed by [[Alexander Aronovich Fel'dbaum]] in 1960.  He showed that in principle the [[optimal control|optimal]] solution can be found by [[dynamic programming]], but this is often impractical;  as a result a number of methods for designing sub-optimal dual controllers have been devised.

==Example==

To use an [[Car analogy|analogy]]: if you are driving a new car you want to get to your destination cheaply and smoothly, but you also want to see how well the car accelerates, brakes and steers so as to get a better feel for how to drive it, so you will do some test manoeuvers for this purpose.  Similarly a dual controller will inject a so-called probing (or exploration) signal into the system that may detract from short-term performance but will improve control in the future.

[[File:Sheep's face, Malta.jpg|thumb|220px|A [[sheep]] with an ear tag.]]

An '''ear tag''' is a plastic or metal object used for [[animal identification|identification]] of domestic [[livestock]] and other animals.  If the ear tag uses Radio Frequency Identification Device ([[RFID]]) technology it is referred to as an '''electronic ear tag'''. Electronic ear tags conform to international standards [[ISO 11784]] and [[ISO 11785]] working at 134.2&amp;nbsp;kHz, as well as [[ISO/IEC 18000]]-6C operating in the UHF spectrum. There are other non-standard systems such as Destron working at 125&amp;nbsp;kHz. Although there are many shapes of ear tags, the main types in current use are as follows:
 
* Flag-shaped ear tag: two discs joined through the ear, one or both bearing a wide, flat plastic surface on which identification details are written or printed in large, easily legible script.
* Button-shaped ear tag: two discs joined through the ear.
* Plastic clip ear tag: a moulded plastic strip, folded over the edge of the ear and joined through it.
* Metal ear tag: an aluminium, steel or brass rectangle with sharp points, clipped over the edge of the ear, with the identification stamped into it.
* Electronic Identification Tags, include the EID number and sometimes a management number on the button that appears on the back of the ear. These can at times be combined as a matched set, which includes Visual tags with Electronic Identification Tags.

Each of these except the metal type may carry a RFID chip, which normally carries an electronic version of the same identification number.

==Overview==
An ear tag usually carries an Animal Identification Number (AIN) or code for the animal, or for its [[herd]] or flock. Non electronic ear tags may be simply handwritten for the convenience of the [[farmer]] (these are known as "management tags"). Alternatively this identification number (ID) may be assigned by an organisation, such as the Meat and Livestock Association (MLA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.com.au/About-MLA|title=About MLA - Meat &amp; Livestock Australia|website=www.mla.com.au|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a not-for-profit organisation owned by cattle, sheep and goat producers; funded by a levy on livestock sales with Federal Government input. Electronic tags may also show other information about the animal, including other related identification numbers; such as the [[Property Identification Code]] (PIC) for the properties the animals have been located. In the case of MLA's NLIS the movement of certain species of livestock (primarily cattle, goats and sheep) must be recorded in the online database within 24 hours of the movement; and include the PICs of the properties the animals are travelling between. The [[National Livestock Identification System]] (NLIS) of [[Australia]] regulations require that all cattle be fitted with a RFID device in the form of an ear tag or [[rumen]] bolus (a cylindrical object placed in the rumen)&lt;ref&gt;[http://qcl.farmonline.com.au/news/state/livestock/news/rumen-bolus-system-pays-off/26371.aspx ''Rumen bolus system pays off''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706104049/http://qcl.farmonline.com.au/news/state/livestock/news/rumen-bolus-system-pays-off/26371.aspx |date=2011-07-06 }}, Queensland Country Life. Retrieved: 2010-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prionics.it/Boli%20ruminali_EN.html ''Ruminal bolus''] Prionics Italia. Retrieved: 2010-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; before movement from the property and that the movement be reported to the NLIS. However, if animals are tagged for internal purposes in a herd or farm, IDs need not be unique in larger scales. The NLIS now also requires sheep and goats to use an ear tag that has the Property Identification Code inscribed on it. These ear tags and boluses are complemented by transport documents supplied by vendors that are used for identification and tracking.  A similar system is used for cattle in the [[European Union]] (EU), each bovine animal having a passport document and tag in each ear carrying the same number (see [[British Cattle Movement Service]]).  Sheep and goats in the EU have a tag in one or both ears carrying the official number of their flock and also for breeding stock an individual number for each animal; one of these tags (usually the left) must have a RFID chip (or the chip may instead be carried in a rumen bolus or on an [[anklet]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/movements/sheep/documents/eid-quickguide.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008075857/http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/movements/sheep/documents/eid-quickguide.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 October 2010|title=UK government guide on identifying sheep from 31 December 2009.|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ear tag can be applied with an ear tag applicator, however there are also specially-designed tags that can be applied by hand. Depending on the purpose of the tagging, an animal may be tagged on one ear or both. There may be requirements for the placement of ear tags, and care must be taken to ensure they are not placed too close to the edge of the ear pinnae; which may leave the tag vulnerable to being ripped out accidentally. If there exists a national animal identification programme in a country, animals may be tagged on both ears for the sake of increased security and effectiveness, or as a legal requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/movements/legislation/index.htm#cattle|title=UK cattle tagging|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If animals are tagged for private purposes, usually one ear is tagged.  Australian sheep and goats are required to have visually readable ear tags printed with a Property Identification Code (PIC). They are complemented by movement documents supplied by consignors that are used for identification and tracking.

Very small ear tags are available for laboratory animals such as [[Laboratory mouse|mice]] and [[Laboratory rat|rats]]. They are usually sold with a device that pierces the animal's ear and installs the tag at the same time. Lab animals can also be identified by other methods such as ear punching or [[earmark (agriculture)|marking]] (also used for livestock; see below), implanted [[RFID]] tags (mice are too small to wear an ear tag containing an RFID chip), and [[dye]].

== History ==
[[File:Ursus maritimus mother with cub.jpg|A sow polar bear with ear tag|left|220px|thumb]]
[[File:Black-tailed Prairie Dog-Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge-1.jpg|A tagged [[black-tailed prairie dog]]|left|220px|thumb]]

Livestock ear tags were developed in 1799 under the direction of Sir [[Joseph Banks]], President of the [[Royal Society]], for identification of [[Merino]] sheep in the flock established for King [[George III]]. [[Matthew Boulton]] designed and produced the first batch of sheep eartags, and produced subsequent batches, modified according to suggestions received from Banks.  The first tags were made of tin.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, H. B.  1964.  His Majesty's Spanish flock. Angus and Robertson, Sydney.  520 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ear tags were incorporated as breed identification in the [[United States]] with the forming of the '''''International Ohio Improved Chester Association''''' as early as 1895, and stipulated in the [[Articles of Incorporation]], as an association animal and breed identification, of the improved [[Chester White]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924066929641;view=1up;seq=45 | title=Ear tags | publisher=Himrods, N.Y. | work=original from Cornell University | date=c. 1895 | accessdate=October 15, 2014 | author=International Ohio Improved Chester Record Association | pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ear tags were developed in Canada as early as 1913 as a means to identify [[cattle]] when testing for [[tuberculosis]], the significant increase of use of ear tags appeared with the outbreak of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] in UK. Today, ear tags in a variety of designs are used throughout the world on many species of animal to ensure traceability, to help prevent theft {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} and to control disease outbreaks.

The first ear tags were primarily [[steel]] with [[nickel]] plating. After [[World War II]], larger, flag-like, [[plastic]] tags were developed in the United States. Designed to be visible from a distance, these were applied by cutting a slit in the ear and slipping the arrow-shaped head of the tag through it so that the flag would hang from the ear.

In 1953, the first two-piece, self-piercing plastic ear tag was developed and patented. This tag, which combined the easy application of metal tags with the visibility and colour options of plastic tags, also limited the transfer of [[blood-borne disease]]s between animals during the application process.

Some cattle ear tags contain chemicals to repel insects, such as [[buffalo fly|buffalo fl]]ies, [[horsefly|horsefl]]ies, etc. Metal ear tags are used to identify the date of regulation shearing of stud and show sheep. Today, a large number of manufacturers are in competition for the identification of world livestock population{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} .

In 2004, the U.S. Government asked farmers to use EID or Electronic Identification ear tags on all their cattle. This request was part of the [[National Animal Identification System]] (NAIS) spurred by the discovery of the first case of mad cow disease in the United States.  Due to poor performance and concern that other people could access their confidential information, only about 30 percent of cattle producers in the United States tried using EID tags using standards based on the low frequency standards, while the UHF standards are being mandated for use in Brazil, Paraguay, and Korea .&lt;ref&gt;[http://cattleidentification.org/ear-tags/eid-tags ''EID Tags - The Next Generation''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204163904/http://cattleidentification.org/ear-tags/eid-tags |date=2012-02-04 }}, CattleIdentification.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States Department of Agriculture maintains a list of manufacturers approved to sell ear tags in the USA.

Ear tags (conventional and electronic) are used in the EU as official ID system for cattle, sheep and goat, in some cases combined with RFID devices

The International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR) controls the issue electronic tag numbers under ISO regulation 11784.

The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is Australia's system for tracing cattle, sheep and goats from birth to slaughter.

In Canada, the Health of Animals Regulations require approved ear tags on all bison, cattle and sheep that leave the farm of origin, except that a bovine may be moved, without a tag, from the farm of origin to a tagging site.&lt;ref&gt;Canada.  Health of Animals Regulations, CRC, c296, Part XV.&lt;/ref&gt;  RFID (radio frequency identification) tags are used for cattle in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaid.com/about_us/tags_tech.html|title=Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) - Canada's national cattle, animal identification program.|website=www.canadaid.com|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and metal as well as RFID tags have been in use for sheep.  Mandatory RFID tagging of sheep in Canada (which was previously scheduled to take effect January 1, 2013) will be deferred to some later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcsheepfed.com/news.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207062514/http://www.bcsheepfed.com/news.html |archivedate=2012-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms of animal identification==
{{Main|Animal identification}}
Pigs, cattle and sheep are frequently [[Earmark (agriculture)|earmark]]ed with pliers that notch registered owner and/or age marks into the ear. [[Mare]]s on large horse breeding farms have a plastic tag attached to a neck strap for identification; which preserves their ears free of notches. Dairy cows are sometimes identified with ratchet fastened plastic anklets fitted on the pastern for ready inspection during milking; however NLIS requirements apply to cattle - including both dairy and beef animals. More commonly coloured electrical tape is used as short term ankle identifiers for dairy animals to identify when one teat should not be milked for any reason.  Laboratory rodents are often marked with ear tags, ear notches or implantable microchips.

The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) Australia, formerly used cattle tail tags for property identification and hormone usage declaration.

'''Ecomom''', founded by [[Jody Sherman]] in 2007, is a failed (and reborn) [[E-commerce]] [[startup company]] offering environmental caring, safe and healthy products for mothers, babies and children. Its head offices are located in [[Las Vegas]] and [[San Francisco]]. Its sales exceeded $1 million by 2011 and it raised $12 million before January 2013.

Ecomom shut down in early 2013, and the founder and CEO, Jody Sherman, became a [[suicide]] shortly afterward.&lt;ref name="Ecomom Intro"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-strategy/online-business-revenue-models/an-ecommerce-business-failure-example/|title=An E-commerce business failure example|last1=Chaffey|first1=Dave|last2=Ellis-Chadwick|first2=Fiona|date=|website=Smart Insights|publisher=Smart Insights (Marketing Intelligence) Ltd|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecomom Intro 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roggio|first1=Armando|title=2 E-commerce Blunders to Avoid in 2015|url=https://www.practicalecommerce.com/2-Ecommerce-Blunders-to-Avoid-in-2015|website=Practical Ecommerce|publisher=Practical Ecommerce Ltd|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GreenCupboards, an E-commerce company selling earth caring products in terms of homes and businesses, then acquired Ecomom and redirected its company name at [[etailz, Inc.]].&lt;ref name="Ecomom Intro 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=GreenCupboards Acquires ecomom|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130424005481/en/GreenCupboards-Acquires-ecomom|website=Business Wire|publisher=Business Wire, Inc.|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website of Ecomom reopened in the early summer of 2013.&lt;ref name="Ecomom Intro"/&gt;

==Reasons for failure==
Venture companies like Ecomom collect micro-finance from angel investors. One defect of this financing mode is that the individual investment of personal investors has little effect on the company. Therefore, individuals don't have much motivation to participate in the company affairs and lead it to success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story Of A Failed Startup And A Founder Driven To Suicide|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/jody-sherman-ecomom-2013-4?IR=T|website=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecomom adopted a deep discounting policy which offered customers fifty-percent discount. As a result, Ecomom lost money every time it sold products because half the price was lower than the cost price. In addition, Ecomom did not make any limitation to the discount and therefore repeat customers were offered the 50% discount when shopping.&lt;ref name="Ecomom Intro 2"/&gt; Ecomom spent excessively on marketing its products, for example the expenditure for [[search engine marketing]] was not proportional to the return of investment.&lt;ref name="Ecomom Intro 2"/&gt; Ecomom did not understand that the abuse of the offered discount would have a negative impact on the company when developing new audiences and markets.&lt;ref name="Ecomom Intro 2"/&gt;

'''Floating liquefied natural gas''' ('''FLNG''') refers to water-based [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) operations employing technologies designed to enable the development of offshore [[natural gas]] resources. Floating above an offshore natural gas field, the FLNG facility  produces, liquefies, stores and transfers LNG (and potentially [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] and [[Natural gas condensate|condensate]]) at sea before carriers ship it directly to markets. The world's first completed FLNG production facility is the PFLNG Satu located in Kanowit gas field off the shore of Sarawak in Malaysia. Petronas is the owner of the platform and first cargo was loaded onto the 150,200-cbm Seri Camellia LNG carrier on 03 April 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lngworldnews.com/malaysias-petronas-in-flng-first/|title=Malaysia’s Petronas in FLNG first|work=LNG World News|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Multiple other FLNG facilities are in development. Another FLNG facility, developed by Exmar NV using Black &amp; Veatch PRICO(R) technology, passed performance test in October 2016 in Nantong, China.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.econotimes.com/Black-Veatch-PRICO-SMR-Becomes-Worlds-First-Proven-FLNG-Technology-to-Achieve-Production-on-a-Floating-Facility-359067|title=Black &amp; Veatch PRICO SMR Becomes World’s First Proven FLNG Technology to Achieve Production on a Floating Facility - EconoTimes|last=EconoTimes|newspaper=EconoTimes|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortuna FLNG, to be commissioned in 2020, owned by a joint-venture between [[Ophir Energy]] and [[Golar LNG]] is still under development in Equatorial Guinea, the US$2 billion vessel would be the first to produce its gas in Africa. The agreement between Equatorial Guinea and state-owned GEPetrol, Ophir and OneLNG reconfirms GEPetrol’s participation rights as partners in 20 per cent of the FLNG project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lngworldshipping.com/news/view,fortuna-flng-edges-closer-to-summer-fid_47550.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Studies into offshore LNG production have been conducted since the early 1970s, but it was only in the mid-1990s that significant research backed by experimental development began.&lt;ref name="touchoilandgas1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchoilandgas.com/offshore-production-happen-review-a465-1.html |accessdate=20 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801000955/http://www.touchoilandgas.com/offshore-production-happen-review-a465-1.html |archivedate=1 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Mobil]] developed a FLNG production concept based on a large, square structure ({{convert|540|x|540|ft}}) with a [[moonpool]] in the center,&lt;ref name=naklie1998&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.ivt.ntnu.no/ept/fag/tep4215/innhold/LNG%20Conferences/1998/Papers/2-1-Naklie.PDF |title=Mobil's Floating LNG Plant |format=PDF |date=1998 |accessdate=2014-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
commonly known as "The Doughnut".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;!-- not found in the Naklie source --&gt;
The Mobil proposal was sized to produce {{convert|6000000|tonne}} LNG per year produced from {{convert|7400000|m3}} per year of feed gas, with storage provided on the structure for {{convert|250000|m3|usgal}} of LNG and {{convert|103000|m3|usgal}} of [[Natural-gas condensate|condensate]].&lt;ref name=naklie1998/&gt;

In 1999, a major study was commissioned as a joint project by [[Chevron Corporation]] and several other oil and gas companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchbriefings.com/pdf/1482/ACF58D.pdf |accessdate=20 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001092033/http://www.touchbriefings.com/pdf/1482/ACF58D.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was closely followed by the so-called 'Azure' research project, conducted by the EU and several oil and gas companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Article by John Bradbury |url=http://www.epmag.com/archives/print/3666.htm |title=Floaters considered for stranded gas |publisher=Epmag.com |date=2001-05-01 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both projects made great progress in [[offshore concrete structure|steel concrete hull design]], topside development and [[Liquefied Natural Gas|LNG]] transfer systems.&lt;ref name="touchoilandgas1"/&gt;

Since the mid-1990s Royal Dutch Shell has been working on its own FLNG technology. This includes engineering and the optimization of its concept related to specific potential project developments in [[Namibia]], [[Timor Leste]]/Australia, and [[Nigeria]].

In July 2009, Royal Dutch Shell signed an agreement with [[Technip]] and [[Samsung]] allowing for the design, construction and installation of multiple Shell FLNG facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technip.com/en/press/shell-awards-floating-lng-contracts-technip-and-samsung |title=Shell awards floating LNG contracts to Technip and Samsung |publisher=Technip |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petrobras]] invited three consortiums to submit proposals for engineering, procurement and construction contracts for FLNG plants in ultra-deep [[Santos Basin]] waters during 2009. A final investment decision was expected in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article202137.ece |title=Petrobras dishes out FLNG FEEDs |publisher=Upstream Online |date=2009-12-21 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014|12|30}}

{{asof|2010|11}}, Japan's [[Inpex]] planned to leverage FLNG to develop the Abadi gas field in the Masela block of the Timor Sea, with a final investment decision expected by the end of 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2010/12/21/inpex-indonesia-gas-idUKTOE6BK05Z20101221 |title=UPDATE 1-Inpex delays Indonesia LNG output start by 2 years &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date= 21 December 2010|accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Late in 2010, Inpex deferred start-up by two years to 2018 and cut its 'first phase' capacity to 2.5 million tons per year (from a previously proposed capacity of 4.5 million tonnes).&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;{{update after|2014|12|30}}&lt;!-- what is status as of early 2015? --&gt;

{{asof|2010|11}}, Chevron Corporation was considering an FLNG facility to develop offshore discoveries in the Exmouth Plateau of Western Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/chevron-considers-floating-lng-plant/story-e6frg8zx-1225946919561 |title=Chevron considers floating LNG plant |publisher=The Australian |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014|12|30}} while in 2011, [[ExxonMobil]] was waiting for an appropriate project to launch its FLNG development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Anthony | last=Guegel |url=http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article254823.ece |title=ExxonMobil in icy innovation |publisher=Upstream Online |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a presentation given by their engineers at GASTECH 2011, [[ConocoPhillips]] aimed to implement a facility by 2016-19, and had completed the quantitative risk analysis of a design that would undergo pre-FEED study during the remainder of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kgu.or.kr/download.php?tb=bbs_017&amp;fn=SESSION_10_(TECHNIAL)___Paul_Davies_ConocoPhillips.pdf&amp;rn=SESSION_10_(TECHNIAL)___Paul_Davies_ConocoPhillips.pdf|format=PDF|title=Belanak FPSO – 5 years of Successful Operation and Its Application to Floating LNG|publisher=Kgu.or.kr|accessdate=30 December 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014|12|30}}

In June 2014, [[GDF Suez]] and [[Santos Limited]] made a decision to halt development on an [[Australia]] offshore gas field project that had proposed to use floating LNG platform technology.  A part of the decision included the perception that long-term capabilities of North American gas fields due to [[hydraulic fracturing]] technologies and increasing [[Russia]]n export capabilities may adversely affect the profitability of the venture due to [[Competition (economics)|competition]].&lt;ref name=wsj20140619&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Kelly|first1=Ross |title=GDF Suez, Santos Halt Innovative LNG Plan in Australia : Companies Say Offshore Conversion Project Not Commercially Viable |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gdf-suez-retreats-from-australian-floating-lng-project-1403167709 |accessdate=30 December 2014 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=19 June 2014 |quote=''The decision highlights the risks confronting Australian gas-export projects as they grapple with high costs and competition from North America and Russia, which are vying to provide Asian utilities with cleaner-burning fuels.

==Current projects==
A number of major gas and oil companies are still researching and considering FLNG developments, with several initiatives planned for the future. However, the world's first development of FLNG is Shell's Au$12bn [[Prelude FLNG|''Prelude'' FLNG]] project, {{convert|200|km}} offshore [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name="platts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petronas.com.my/media-relations/media-releases/Pages/article/PETRONAS-LAUNCHES-HULL-OF-ITS-FIRST-FLOATING-LNG-FACILITY.aspx|title=PETRONAS launches hull of its first floating LNG facility|date=2014-04-07|publisher=Petronas.com.my|accessdate=2014-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Royal Dutch Shell announced their investment in FLNG on 20 May 2011 and construction began in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/bn-prelude-floating-plant-has-shell-fired-for-lng/story-e6frg9ef-1226059923612 |title=$12bn Prelude floating plant has Shell fired for LNG |publisher=The Australian |accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 Shell's FLNG technology was selected as the Sunrise Joint Venture’s preferred option for developing the Greater Sunrise gas fields in the [[Timor Sea]]. This followed an extensive and rigorous concept-evaluation process during which the merits of the project were weighed up against alternative onshore solutions. The [[Woodside Petroleum|Woodside-operated]] JV is now seeking to engage regulators on the concept selection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shell.com/home/content/media/news_and_media_releases/archive/2010/flng_technology_greater_sunrise_29042010.html |title=Shell floating LNG technology chosen by joint venture for Greater Sunrise project - Shell Worldwide |publisher=Shell.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529042931/http://www.shell.com/home/content/media/news_and_media_releases/archive/2010/flng_technology_greater_sunrise_29042010.html |archivedate=29 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the decision by Shell to go ahead with its Prelude FLNG development, the Sunrise project would be the second deployment of Shell’s proprietary FLNG design.
The Shell project is scheduled to begin processing gas in 2016.&lt;ref name=wsj20140619/&gt;

In February 2011, [[Petronas]] awarded a FEED contract for an FLNG unit to a consortium of Technip and [[Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiatopnews.net/25020/technip-daewoo-win-feed-contract-on-petronas-flng-vessel-offshore-malaysia/ |title=Technip, Daewoo win FEED contract on Petronas’ FLNG vessel offshore Malaysia |publisher=Asia Top News |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility will be located in Malaysia, although the specific gas field is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technip.com/en/press/technip-awarded-key-engineering-contract-flng-malaysia |title=awarded a key engineering contract for a FLNG in Malaysia |publisher=Technip |date=2011-02-01 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014|12|30}}

[[Petronas]] first FLNG, the "PFLNG SATU" produced and delivered its first LNG cargo from the "Kanowit" gas field offshore Bintulu, Sarawak, Malaysia on 1 April 2017. The first cargo was fully loaded onto the LNG carrier Seri Camellia and headed for the Asia market.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.petronasofficial.com/floating-lng&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lngworldnews.com/petronas-pflng-satu-produces-first-lng-offshore-malaysia/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lngworldnews.com/malaysias-petronas-in-flng-first/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.petronas.com.my/media-relations/media-releases/Pages/article/SUCCESSFUL-PRODUCTION-OF-LNG-FROM-PETRONAS%27-FIRST-FLOATING-LNG-FACILITY,-PFLNG-SATU.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.petronas.com.my/media-relations/media-releases/Pages/article/PETRONAS%E2%80%99-FIRST-FLOATING-LNG-FACILITY,-PFLNG-SATU.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, [[Petronas]] awarded a FEED contract for another FLNG unit called "PFLNG2" to consortium of [[JGC Corporation]]. and Samsung Heavy Industry. This Facility will be placed next to PFLNG1 describe above.

GDF Suez Bonaparte – a joint venture undertaken by the Australian oil and gas exploration company [[Santos Limited|Santos]] (40%) and the French multi-international energy company [[GDF Suez]] (60%) – has awarded a pre-FEED contract for the Bonaparte FLNG project offshore Northern Australia. The final investment decision is expected in 2014,{{update after|2014|12|30}} with startup planned for 2018. The first phase of the project calls for a floating [[Liquefied Natural Gas|LNG]] production facility with a capacity of 2 million mt/year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santos.com/library/100111_Pre_FEED_contracts_awarded_for_Bonaparte_LNG.pdf|format=PDF|title=Pre-FEED contracts awarded for Bonaparte LNG |publisher=Santos.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Exmar NV performance tested a facility design by Black &amp; Veatch using the proprietary PRICO(R) process. The facility has a single liquefaction train that can produce 72 million cubic feet a day of LNG.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In June 4th, 2018, Golar LNG announced that their FLNG Hilli Episeyo had got a customer acceptance after successfully being tested in 16 days commissioning. FLNG Hilli Episeyo will serve Parenco Cameroon SA in Cameroon's water. FLNG Hilli Episeyo uses PRICO(R) technology from Black &amp; Veatch and was built in Keppel Shipyard in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.golarlng.com/investors/press-releases/pr-story.aspx?ResultPageURL=http://cws.huginonline.com/G/133076/PR/201806/2197085.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, Fortuna FLNG owned by a joint venture between [[Ophir Energy]] and [[Golar LNG]] is expected to come on stream producing around 2.2 mmtpa of gas in Equatorial Guinea. The LNG facility will become the first FLNG to operate in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naturalgasworld.com/the-rise-of-flng-ngw-magazine-53962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Moving [[Liquefied Natural Gas|LNG]] production to an offshore setting presents a demanding set of challenges. In terms of the design and construction of the FLNG facility, every element of a conventional LNG facility needs to fit into an area roughly one quarter the size, whilst maintaining appropriate levels of safety and giving increased flexibility to LNG production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.igu.org/html/wgc2006pres/data/wgcppt/pdf/PGC%20Programme%20Committees/PGC%20D/Safety%20and%20technology%20developments%20in%20LNG%20plants,%20terminals%20and%20vessels/9.3EF.06.pdf |accessdate=20 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812201942/http://www.igu.org/html/wgc2006pres/data/wgcppt/pdf/PGC%20Programme%20Committees/PGC%20D/Safety%20and%20technology%20developments%20in%20LNG%20plants%2C%20terminals%20and%20vessels/9.3EF.06.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a facility is in operation, [[Swell (ocean)|wave motion]] will present another major challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lngworldnews.com/the-netherlands-flng-vessel-as-safe-as-any-other-offshore-facility-shell-says/ |title=The Netherlands: FLNG Vessel as Safe as any Other Offshore Facility, Shell Says &gt;&gt; |publisher=LNG World News |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LNG containment systems need to be capable of withstanding the damage that can occur when the sea’s wave and current motions cause sloshing in the partly filled tanks. Product transfers also need to deal with the effects of winds, waves and currents in the open seas.&lt;ref name=naklie1998/&gt;

Solutions to reduce the effect of motion and weather are addressed in the design, which must be capable of withstanding – and even reducing – the impact of waves. In this area, technological development has been mainly evolutionary rather than revolutionary, leveraging and adapting technologies that are currently applied to offshore oil production or onshore [[liquefaction]]. For example, traditional LNG loading arms{{clarify|date=December 2014}} have been adapted to enable LNG transfers in open water, and hose-based solutions for both side-by-side transfers in calmer seas and tandem transfers in rougher conditions are nearing{{when|date=December 2014}} fruition.&lt;ref name="laohamutuk1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laohamutuk.org/Oil/Sunrise/PotenFLNGBreakthrough.pdf|format=PDF|title=A BREAKTHROUGH FOR FLOATING LNG?|publisher=Laohamutuk.org|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
{{Disputed section|date=June 2011}}
Among [[fossil fuel]]s, [[natural gas]] is relatively clean burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngsa.org/download/issues/NGCleanestBurningFossilFuel.pdf|format=PDF|title=Natural Gas: Cleanest Burning Fossil Fuel Understand the numbers behind the claim|publisher=Ngsa.org|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also abundant and affordable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stocksonwallstreet.net/featured/natural-gas-clean-quality-cheap-domestic-abundant.php |title=Natural Gas: Clean, Quality, Cheap, Domestic, &amp; Abundant |publisher=: |date=2011-04-26 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and may be able to meet world energy needs by realising the potential of otherwise unviable gas reserves (several of which can be found offshore North West Australia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offshore-industry.eu/offshore_v2/?p=536 |title=Prelude LNG Development to Deploy Shell’s FLNG Technology |publisher=Offshore-industry.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FLNG technology also provides a number of environmental and economic advantages:
[[Image:FPSO diagram.PNG|thumb|right|500px|FLNG or [[Floating production storage and offloading|FPSO]] diagram]]
* Environmental - Because all processing is done at the gas field, there is no need to lay long [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] all the way to the shore. There is also no requirement for compression units to pump the gas to shore, dredging and jetty construction or the onshore construction of an LNG processing plant, all of which significantly reduce the project's environmental footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaaoc.com/news-old/shell-receives-green-light-for-prelude-flng |title=Shell receives green light for Prelude FLNG — SEAAOC 2011 |publisher=Seaaoc.com |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Avoiding construction also helps preserve marine and coastal environments. Additionally, environmental disturbance would be minimised during the later decommissioning of the facility, because it could be disconnected easily and removed before being refurbished and re-deployed elsewhere.
* Economic – Where pumping gas to shore can be prohibitively expensive, FLNG makes development economically viable. As a result, it will open up new business opportunities for countries to develop offshore gas fields that would otherwise remain stranded, such as those off the coast of East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visiongain.com/Report/568/The-Floating-Liquefied-Natural-Gas-(FLNG)-Market-2011-2021 |title=The Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) Market 2011-2021 - Report - Energy |publisher=visiongain |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FLNG is also conducive to side stepping complexities involving neighboring countries where disputes would make pipelines vulnerable or impractical such as in Cyprus and Israel. Moreover, LNG is slowly gaining its role as direct use fuel without [[regasification]] with operational cost and least pollution benefits in road, rail, air and marine transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/ICCTwhitepaper_MarineLNG_130513.pdf |title= Assessment of the fuel cycle impact of liquefied natural gas as used in international shipping|publisher=Theicct.org|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://208.175.66.104/article/2013/01/24/energy-transportfuel-corre-idINL6N0ATD8K20130124 |title= Gas at the gates of oil's transport fuel citadel |accessdate= 6 June 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20140606141417/http://208.175.66.104/article/2013/01/24/energy-transportfuel-corre-idINL6N0ATD8K20130124 |archivedate= 6 June 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
The FLNG facility will be moored directly above the natural gas field. It will route gas from the field to the facility via [[Drilling riser|risers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2hoffshore.com/documents/papers/Disconnectable%20and%20Relocatable%20Riser%20System%20Solution%20for%20FLNG%20in%20Harsh%20Environment.pdf |title=Microsoft PowerPoint - Disconnectable and Relocatable Riser System Solution for FLNG in Harsh Environment.ppt |format=PDF|publisher=2hoffshore.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the gas reaches the facility, it will be processed to produce natural gas, LPG, and natural gas condensate. The processed feed gas will be treated to remove impurities, and liquefied through freezing, before being stored in the hull. Ocean-going carriers will offload the LNG, as well as the other liquid by-products, for delivery to markets worldwide.&lt;ref name="shell1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-static.shell.com/static/aus/downloads/about_shell/prelude/completeeisdoclowres.pdf |title=Shell Booklet-blank pgs in.indd |format=PDF|publisher=Static.shell.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conventional alternative to this would be to pump gas through pipelines to a shore-based facility for liquefaction, before transferring the gas for delivery.&lt;ref name="touchoilandgas1"/&gt;

==Specifications==
In the case of Shell’s [[Prelude FLNG]], engineers have managed to fit every component of an LNG plant into an area roughly one quarter the size of a conventional onshore plant. Even so, Shell's facility will be the largest floating offshore facility ever built: It will measure around 488m long and 74m wide, and when fully ballasted will weigh 600,000 tonnes (roughly six times as much as the [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|USS Nimitz aircraft carrier]]).&lt;ref name="gastoday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gastoday.com.au/news/flng_gets_serious/042981/ |title=FLNG gets serious — Gas Today — The magazine for Australia’s natural gas industry |publisher=Gastoday.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specifications make Shell's FLNG facility particularly well-suited for fields with high production rates for reserves starting at {{convert|2|to|3|Tcuft}} and beyond – less than a tenth the size of the [[Groningen gas field]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="laohamutuk1"/&gt;

==Construction==
The First FLNG, Shell 'Prelude' FLNG facility will be constructed at Samsung's [[Geoje|Geoje Island shipyard]] in Korea. Some modules may be constructed elsewhere and then transferred to the shipyard for assembly. The facility can remain on station for more than 25 years, and its lifetime can be further extended through overhaul and refurbishment.&lt;ref name="gastoday1"/&gt;  The hull has a design life of 50 years.

[[Petronas]] two FLNG facility will be constructed at different place, Samsung and Daewoo.

==Safety==
A unique feature of Shell’s FLNG design is its ability to stay safely moored in harsh weather conditions, including [[Tropical cyclone scales|category five cyclones]]. Potentially, this could result in more uptime for the facility.

Additionally, Shell designers have optimised safety on the facility by locating storage facilities and process equipment as far from crew accommodation as possible.&lt;ref name="shell1"/&gt;  As a result of this, the accommodation areas of visiting LNG carriers are also at maximum distance from critical safety equipment. Safety gaps have been allowed between modules of process equipment so that gas can disperse quickly in the event of a gas leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-static.shell.com/static/aus/downloads/about_shell/prelude/chap4lowres |accessdate=20 May 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gateway Inc.''', previously '''Gateway 2000''', was an American [[computer hardware]] company based in [[South Dakota]] and later [[California]], that developed, manufactured, supported, and marketed a wide range of [[personal computer]]s, [[computer monitor]]s, [[server (computing)|servers]], and computer accessories. 

It was acquired by [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] in October 2007.&lt;ref name=Acer.53&gt;{{cite web |website=CNN.com

Gateway was founded on September 5, 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Ever Happened To Gateway?

Co-Founder Mike Hammond Dies at Age 53 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally called '''Gateway 2000''', it was one of the first widely successful [[e-commerce|direct-sales]] PC companies, utilizing a sales model copied from [[Dell Computer|Dell]], and playing up its Iowa roots with low-tech advertisements proclaiming "Computers from Iowa?" 

Gateway 2000 was also an innovator in low-end computers with the first sub-$1,000 name-brand PC, the all-in-one Astro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |date=June 1, 2000 |title=Hands-On - Gateway Astro

|quote=Gateway's Astro .. affordable and compact .. in a single unit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gateway built brand recognition in part by shipping computers in spotted boxes patterned after [[Holstein Friesian cattle|Holstein cow]] markings. In 1989, Gateway moved its corporate offices and production facilities to [[North Sioux City, South Dakota]]. In line with the Holstein cow mascot, Gateway opened a chain of ''farm-styled'' retail stores called '''Gateway Country''' Stores, mostly in [[suburb]]an areas across the [[United States]]. It dropped the "2000" from its name on October 31, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper  |newspaper=Sioux City Journal |date=December 16, 2007

[[AOL]] acquired Gateway.net, the online component of Gateway, Inc., in October 1999 for [[US$]]800 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com/Gateway-closes-AOL-chapter-with-stock-buyback/2100-1047_3-5436475.html|title=Gateway closes AOL chapter with stock buyback|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To grow beyond its model of selling high-end PCs by phone, and to attract top management and engineers, Gateway relocated its base of operations to [[La Jolla|La Jolla, California]], in May 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Crockett | first = Roger O. | title = Gateway Loses the Folksy Shtick: CEO Waitt Looks West to Lure Sophisticated Talent | publisher = BusinessWeek | url = http://www.businessweek.com/1998/27/b3585103.htm | accessdate = 2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to cut operating costs, Gateway made another move, this time to [[Poway, California]], in October 2001. After acquiring [[eMachines]] in 2004, Gateway again relocated its corporate headquarters, to [[Irvine, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Technology Briefing, Hardware: Gateway Plans Move | publisher = New York Times | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04EFDC1539F932A35757C0A9629C8B63 | accessdate = 2007-06-12 | date=April 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Freeman | first = Mike | title =  Gateway Inc. to leave Poway | publisher = San Diego Union-Tribune | url = http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/business/20040330-2022-gateway.html | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=203101|title=Gateway, Inc.: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] filed fraud charges against three former Gateway executives: CEO Jeff Weitzen, former chief financial officer John Todd, and former controller Robert Manza.&lt;ref name="CNET fraud"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kawamoto |first1=Dawn |title=Former Gateway CEO, two others charged with fraud |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/former-gateway-ceo-two-others-charged-with-fraud/ |accessdate=28 November 2018 |work=CNET |date=14 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit alleged that the executives engaged in securities violations and misled investors about the health of the company.&lt;ref name="CNET fraud"/&gt; Weitzen was cleared of securities fraud in 2006, however,  Todd and Manza were found liable for inflating revenue in a jury trial which concluded in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex-Gateway executives found liable in accounting fraud |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/09/business/fi-gateway9 |accessdate=28 November 2018 |work=Los Angeles Times |agency=Associated Press |date=9 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Gateway expanded into the consumer electronics world with products that included [[Plasma display|plasma screen TVs]], [[digital camera]]s, DLP projectors, wireless Internet [[Router (computing)|routers]], and [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]]. While the company enjoyed some success in gaining substantial market share from traditional leaders in the space, particularly with plasma TVs and digital cameras, the limited short-term profit potential of those product lines led then-CEO Wayne Inouye to pull the company out of that segment during 2004. Gateway still acts as a [[retailer]] selling third-party electronic goods online.

Gateway resourced customer support within North America, priding itself as "100% North America-based support".{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Gateway also moved build-to-order desktop, laptop, and server manufacturing back to the United States, with the opening of its Gateway Configuration Center in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in September 2006. It employed 385 people in that location. By April 2007, Gateway notebook computers were produced in [[China]] and its desktops had "made in [[Mexico]]" stickers.

On October 16, 2007, Acer completed its acquisition of Gateway.&lt;ref&gt;http://global.acer.com/about/news.asp?id=6775 About Acer – News Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930200545/http://global.acer.com/about/news.asp?id=6775 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current and previous products==

=== Previous hardware ===
In September 2002, Gateway entered the [[consumer electronics]] market with aggressively priced plasma TVs. At the time, Gateway's US$2,999 price for a 42" plasma TV undercut name brand competitors by thousands of dollars per unit. In 2003, the company expanded the range of plasma TVs and added [[digital camera]]s, MP3 players, and other devices. By early 2004, in terms of volume, Gateway had moved into a leadership position in the plasma TV category in the United States. However, pressure to achieve profits after the acquisition of [[eMachines]] led the company to phase Gateway-branded consumer electronics out of their product line.

The [[Wiener filter]] as originally proposed by [[Norbert Wiener]] is a [[signal processing]] [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]] which uses knowledge of the statistical properties of both the signal and the noise to reconstruct an optimal estimate of the signal from a noisy one-dimensional time-ordered data stream. The '''generalized Wiener filter''' generalizes the same idea beyond the domain of one-dimensional time-ordered signal processing, with two-dimensional [[image processing]] being the most common application.&lt;ref name="pratt"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pratt |first=William K. |date=July 1972 |title=Generalized Wiener Filtering Computation Techniques |url=http://www.dfmf.uned.es/~daniel/www-imagen-dhp/biblio/wiener-filtering-general.pdf |journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers |volume=c-21 |issue=7 |accessdate=4 October 2014 | doi = 10.1109/t-c.1972.223567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Consider a data [[vector space|vector]] &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; which is the sum of [[statistically independent|independent]] signal and noise vectors &lt;math&gt;d = s+n&lt;/math&gt; with zero mean and [[covariance]]s &lt;math&gt;\langle s^Ts\rangle=S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle n^Tn\rangle=N&lt;/math&gt;. The generalized Wiener Filter is the [[linear operator]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; which minimizes the expected residual between the estimated signal and the true signal, &lt;math&gt;e = \langle(Gd-s)^T(Gd-s)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes this is &lt;math&gt;G = S(S+N)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the Wiener estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat s = S(S+N)^{-1}d&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of [[Normal distribution|Gaussian distributed]] signal and noise, this estimator is also the [[Maximum a posteriori estimation|maximum a posteriori estimator]].

The generalized Wiener filter approaches 1 for signal-dominated parts of the data, and S/N for noise-dominated parts.

An often-seen variant expresses the filter in terms of inverse covariances. This is mathematically equivalent, but avoids excessive loss of numerical precision in the presence of high-variance modes. In this formulation, the generalized Wiener filter becomes &lt;math&gt;G = (S^{-1}+N^{-1})^{-1}N^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; using the identity &lt;math&gt;A^{-1}+B^{-1}=A^{-1}(A+B)B^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==An example==
The [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) is a [[Lambda-CDM model|homogeneous and isotropic random field]], and its covariance is therefore diagonal in a [[spherical harmonics]] basis. Any given observation of the CMB will be noisy, with the noise typically having different statistical properties than the CMB. It could for example be uncorrelated in pixel space. The generalized Wiener filter exploits this difference in behavior to isolate as much as possible of the signal from the noise.
[[File:CMB Wiener filter example.png|thumb|upright=4|center|The result of applying a generalized Wiener filter to a noisy observation of the cosmic microwave background. The filter results in an image that is signal-dominated at all scales, at the cost of introducing a bias (seen as blurring in this example).]]

The Wiener-filtered estimate of the signal (the CMB in this case) &lt;math&gt;\hat s = S(S+N)^{-1}d&lt;/math&gt; requires the inversion of the usually huge matrix &lt;math&gt;S+N&lt;/math&gt;. If S and N were diagonal in the same basis this would be trivial, but often, as here, that isn't the case. The solution must in these cases be found by solving the equivalent equation &lt;math&gt;(S+N)S^{-1}\hat s = d&lt;/math&gt;, for example via [[conjugate gradients]] iteration. In this case all the multiplications can be performed in the appropriate basis for each matrix, avoiding the need to store or invert more than their diagonal. The result can be seen in the figure.{{Citation needed|reason= A reliable source is needed for this paragraph| date= March 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="792">'''H3''' is a [[pyrotechnic composition]] which is used mostly as a [[burst charge]] for small diameter shells.  It is friction and shock sensitive, as are most compositions containing chlorates. For this reason, H3 should be mixed using the "diaper method" and not with a ball mill. The composition consists of:

*[[Potassium chlorate]] (KClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ([[Oxidizing agent]]) - 75%
*[[Charcoal]] ([[Fuel]]) - 25%
*[[Dextrin]] ([[Binder (material)|binder]]) - 2% (additional percent)

Due to the potassium chlorate, H3 should not be mixed with sulfur or compositions containing sulfur, as sulfur increases the sensitivity of the mixture.

'''H5P''' is a [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] [[content collaboration framework]] based on [[JavaScript]]. H5P is an abbreviation for HTML5 Package, and aims to make it easy for everyone to create, share and reuse interactive HTML5 content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=WPMUDEV |title=WordPress And H5P : The Future Of Rich Content? |url=http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wordpress-and-h5p-the-future-of-rich-content/ |accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=elearningindustry.com |title=H5P: An Open Source HTML5 eLearning Authoring Tool |url=http://elearningindustry.com/h5p-an-open-source-html5-elearning-authoring-tool |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactive videos, interactive presentations, quizzes, interactive timelines and more&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=H5P.org |title=Content Types |url=http://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed and shared using H5P on [https://h5p.org/ H5P.org]. H5P is being used by 17 000+ websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Wordpress.org |title=H5P is a WordPress plugin for creating and sharing rich HTML5 content in your browser. |url=https://wordpress.org/plugins/h5p/stats/ |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=drupal.org |title=Usage statistics for H5P - Create and Share Rich Content and Applications |url=https://www.drupal.org/project/usage/h5p |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=moodle.org |title=Moodle plugins directory: Interactive Content – H5P: Stats |url=https://moodle.org/plugins/stats.php?plugin=mod_hvp |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017 the core team announced that H5P will be supported financially by the [[Mozilla Foundation]] within the MOSS program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://h5p.org/node/267641|title=Mozilla supporting H5P|accessdate=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The framework consists of a web based content editor, a web site for sharing content types, plugins for existing CMS's and a file format for bundling together HTML5 resources.

The web based editor is by default able to add and replace multimedia files and textual content in all kinds of H5P content types and applications. In addition a content type may provide custom widgets for the editor enabling any kind of editing capabilities and experiences including wysiwyg editing of the entire content type.

H5P.org is the community website where H5P libraries, applications and content types may be shared. H5P applications and content types work the same way in all H5P compatible websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=H5P.org |title=Create, share and reuse interactive HTML5 content in your browser |url=http://h5p.org |accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently four platform integrations exist, one for [[Drupal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=drupal.org |title=H5P - Create and Share Rich Content and Applications |url=https://www.drupal.org/project/h5p |accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WordPress]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=wordpress.org |title=H5P is a WordPress plugin for creating and sharing rich HTML5 content in your browser |url=https://wordpress.org/plugins/h5p/ |accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware|Tiki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=tiki.org |title=Tiki Wiki Content Management has native H5P integration|url=https://doc.tiki.org/H5P|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one for [[Moodle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://h5p.org/blog/h5p-for-moodle-is-ready/|title=H5P is a Moodle plugin for creating and sharing rich HTML5 content in your browser.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=h5p.org|access-date=|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform integrations include the generic H5P code as well as interface implementations and platform specific code needed to integrate H5P with the platforms. H5P has been designed to have a minimum of platform specific code and a minimum of backend code. Most of the code is JavaScript. The aim is to make it easy to integrate H5P with new platforms.

The file format consists of a metadata file in [[JSON]] format, a number of library files providing features and design for the content and a content folder where textual content is stored in JSON format and multimedia is stored as files or links to files on external sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=h5p.org |title=File Structure |url=http://h5p.org/specification |accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
H5P's primary support website is H5P.org. Here, H5P may be tried out; it hosts the online manual for H5P and a living repository for H5P information, documentation and forums.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''integrated nanoliter system''' is a measuring, separating, and mixing device that is able to measure fluids to the [[nanoliter]], mix different fluids for a specific [[Product (biology)|product]], and separate a solution into simpler solutions.
&lt;ref name="An Integrated Nanoliter"&gt;Burns, Mark A., Brian N. Johnson, Sundaresh N. Brahmasandra, Kalyan Handique, James R. Webster, Madhavi Krishnan, Timoth S. Sammacro, Piu M. Man, Darren Jones, Dylan Heldsinger, Carlos H. Mastrangelo, and David T. Burke, [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/282/5388/484.full "An Integrated Nanoliter DNA Analysis Device"], American Association for the Advancement of Science, January 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

All features of the integrated nanoliter system are specifically designed for controlling very small volume of liquid (referred as [[microfluidic]] solutions). The integrated nanoliter system's scalability depends on what type of processing method the system is based on (refer as technology platform) with each processing method having its advantages and disadvantages. Possible uses for the integrated nanoliter system are in controlling [[biological]] fluids (refer as [[synthetic biology]]) and accurately detecting changes in [[Cell (biology)|cells]] for [[Genetics|genetic]] purposes (such as single-cell [[gene expression]] analysis) where the smaller scale directly influences the result and accuracy.

== Features ==

The integrated nanoliter system consists of [[Microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[fluidic]] [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|channels]], heaters, temperature sensors, and [[fluorescence]] detectors. The [[Microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[fluidic]] [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|channels]] (basically very small pipes) act as the main transportation structures for any fluids as well as where [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] occur within the system. For the desired [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] to occur, the temperature needs to be adjusted. Therefore, heaters are attached to some [[Microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[fluidic]] [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|channels]]. To monitor and maintain the desired temperature, temperature sensors are crucial for successful and desired [[Chemical reaction|reactions]]. In order to accurately track the fluids before and after a [[Chemical reaction|reaction]], [[fluorescence]] detectors are used for detecting the movements of the fluids within the system. For instance, when a specific fluid passes a certain point where it triggers or [[Excited state|excites]] [[List of light sources|emission]] of light, the [[fluorescence]] detector is able to receive that [[List of light sources|emission]] and calculate the time it takes to reach that certain point.&lt;ref name="An Integrated Nanoliter" /&gt;

== Technology Platforms for Scalability==
There are three different technology platforms for the integrated nanoliter system's [[scalability]]. Therefore, the main processing method of the integrated nanoliter system varies from the type of technology platform it is using. The three technology platforms for [[scalability]] are electrokinetic manipulation, vesicle encapsulation, and mechanical valving.&lt;ref name="Integrated Nanoliter System"&gt;Hong, J. W. &amp; Quake, S., [http://thebigone.stanford.edu/papers/Hong%20Natbiotech.pdf "Integrated Nanoliter System"], ''In Nature Biotechnology'', 21, 1179-1183&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrokinetic Manipulation ===

The main processing method for controlling the fluid under this technology platform is the capillary [[electrophoresis]], which is an [[electrokinetic]] phenomena. Capillary [[electrophoresis]] is a great method for controlling fluids because the charged particles of the fluid are being directed by the controllable electric field within the system. However, a disadvantage of the technique is that the method of controlling the fluid's particles heavily depends on the particles' original charges. Another disadvantage is that the possible fluid "leaks" within the system. These "leaks" occur through [[diffusion]] which are dependent on the size of the fluid's particles.&lt;ref name="Integrated Nanoliter System" /&gt;

=== Vesicle Encapsulation ===

The main processing method for controlling the fluid under this technology platform is to confine the fluids of interest in carrier molecules, which are generally [[droplets]] of water, [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]], or  [[micelles]]. The carrier molecules (with the fluid within them) are controlled by individually directing each carrier molecules within the [[Microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[fluidic]] [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|channels]]. This method is great for solving the possible fluid "leaks", since confinement of the fluid in a carrier molecule does not depend on the size of the fluid's particles. However, this technique has a disadvantage on how complex the solution can be when using the system.&lt;ref name="Integrated Nanoliter System" /&gt;

=== Mechanical Valving ===

The main processing method for controlling the fluid under this technology platform is the use of small mechanical [[valves]]. Mechanical valving is similar to a complex plumbing system because the [[Microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[fluidic]] [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|channels]] act as the plumbing pipes while the various controllable [[valves]] direct the fluid. Mechanical valving is also considered to be the most [[Structural robustness|robust]] solution to the disadvantages of the [[electrokinetic]] manipulation and [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] encapsulation, since the mechanical valves operate completely independent from the fluid's physical and chemical properties. Because the physical properties that make up the [[Microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[fluidic]] [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|channels]] and mechanical [[valves]] are difficult to process due to the system's extremely small scale, this technique has a disadvantage of creating an integrated nanoliter system with mechanical valving to the [[nanoliter]] scale.&lt;ref name="Integrated Nanoliter System" /&gt;

== Possible Uses of this System ==

=== Synthetic Biology ===

A possible use of the integrated nanoliter system is in [[synthetic biology]] (controlling [[biological]] fluids). Since the integrated nanoliter system is generally made up of many controllable [[Microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[fluidic]] [[Flow network|networks]], integrated nanoliter systems are an ideal environment for controlling [[biological]] fluids. A common process of synthetic biology that uses the integrated nanoliter system is processing complex reactions among [[biological]] fluids, which usually involves separating a [[biological]] solution into individual pure or simpler [[reagent]] solutions then mixing the individual solutions for the desired [[Product (biology)|product]]. An advantage of using the integrated nanoliter system in synthetic biology includes the extremely small length of the [[microfluidic]] [[Flow network|networks]] that result in fast [[diffusion]] rates. Another advantage is the fast mixing rates due to the combination of [[diffusion]] and [[advection]] ([[chaotic mixing]]). Compared to previous [[microfluidic]] systems, another advantage is the smaller necessary amount of [[reagent]] solutions for a single operation due to the integrated nanoliter system's [[microscopic]] [[scalability]]. Smaller necessary amounts of [[reagent]] solutions tend to lead to more operations that can be carried out with less [[Lag|delay]] from gathering or reproducing the necessary amounts of [[reagent]] solutions.&lt;ref name="Synthetic Biology"&gt;Gulati, Shelly, Vincent Rouilly, Xize Niu, James Chappell, Richard I. Kitney, Joshua B. Edel, Paul S. Freemont, and Andrew J. DeMello, [http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/Suppl_4/S493.full "Opportunities for Microfluidic Technologies in Synthetic Biology"], Journal of the Royal Society Interface, January 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Single-Cell Gene Expression Analysis ===

Another possible use of the integrated nanoliter system is in single-cell [[gene expression]] analysis. One benefit of using the integrated nanoliter system is its capability to detect the changes of a gene expression more accurately than the previous technique of [[microarray]]. The nanoliter system's [[microscopic]] [[scalability]] ([[nanoliter]] to [[picoliter]] scale) allows it to analyze the [[gene expression]] at the single-cell level (around 1 [[picoliter]]), while the [[microarray]] analyzes changes of the gene expression by [[average|averaging]] a large group of cells. Another convenient and important benefit is the integrated nanoliter system's capability of having all the necessary [[biological]] fluids in the system before operation by storing each [[biological]] fluid in a specific [[Microfabrication|microfabricated]] [[fluidic]] [[Flow network|network]]. The integrated nanoliter system is convenient because the [[biological]] fluids are all controlled by a computer compared to how previous systems required a manual loading of every [[biological]] fluid. The integrated nanoliter system is also important for the gene expression analysis because the analysis would not be undesirably influenced by [[contamination]] due to the "closed" system while in operation.

'''Lawrence Harding''' "'''Larry'''" '''Johnston''' (February 11, 1918 – December 4, 2011) was an American physicist, a young contributor to the [[Manhattan Project]]. He was the only man to witness all three atomic explosions in 1945: the [[Trinity nuclear test]] and the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].&lt;ref name=missoul&gt;{{cite news |url=http://missoulian.com/lifestyles/territory/idaho-man-witness-to-atomic-blasts/article_994031d6-121a-11e1-8663-001cc4c03286.html |newspaper=Missoulian |location=Montana |agency=''(Lewiston Tribune)'' |title=Idaho man witness to 3 atomic blasts |last=Lee |first=Sandra L.

During [[World War II]], he worked at the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]] where he invented [[ground-controlled approach]] radar. In 1944, he went to the Manhattan Project's [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], where he co-invented the [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]].

After the war he completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis in 1950, and became an associate professor at the [[University of Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis]]. He later worked at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] as head of the electronics department, and was a professor at the [[University of Idaho]] in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]],&lt;ref name=uipchrk&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M6hYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=r_gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3860%2C1610666 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |title=UI professors change rank |date=July 7, 1971 |page=b3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gom83dc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1983/111 |work=Gem of the Mountains |agency=(University of Idaho yearbook)  |title=Idaho's lifeblood: research |year=1983 |page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he taught until his retirement.

==Early life==
Born in [[Shandong]], [[China]], on February 11, 1918,&lt;ref name="South Fork"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sfcompanion.blogspot.com/2014/02/inventor-atomic-bomb-witness-and.html |work=South Fork Companion |date=February 11, 2013 |title=Inventor, Atomic Bomb Witness, and University Professor Larry Johnston |accessdate=October 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston's parents were American [[Presbyterian]] missionaries.&lt;ref name="asa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.asa3.org/archive/asa/200208/0005.html |last=Johnston |first=Lawrence |title=Bio: Lawrence Johnston |publisher=[[American Scientific Affiliation]] |accessdate=August 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family returned to the United States in 1923, and his father became a Presbyterian pastor in [[Santa Maria, California]].&lt;ref name="South Fork"/&gt;

After graduation from [[Hollywood High School]] in 1936, Johnston earned an [[associate degree]] at [[Los Angeles City College]]. He transferred to the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], where [[Luis Walter Alvarez]] was a graduate student. Johnston received his [[bachelor's degree]] in physics in 1940.&lt;ref name=vitaui&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~johnston/VITA.doc |title=Vita for Lawrence Johnston |publisher=University of Idaho |date=October 28, 2010 |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeeohlj&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Lawrence_Johnston |publisher=IEEE Global History Network |title=Oral-History: Lawrence Johnston |last=Nebeker |first=Frederik |agency=(interview) |date=June 13, 1991 |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==

===MIT Radiation Laboratory===
Johnston intended to study for his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] under Alvarez,  but instead followed him east to the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]] near [[Boston]] in February 1941. Alvarez and Johnston worked together on [[ground-controlled approach]] radar. This allowed aircraft to be guided a safe landing in adverse weather conditions, based on radar images,&lt;ref name="South Fork"/&gt; and  would later prove crucial during the [[Berlin Airlift]].&lt;ref name="South Fork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Moscow-Pullman Daily News]] |url=http://dnews.com/obituaries/article_638dd0a7-0065-51db-b6ac-08563d7abe78.html?mode=story |title=Obituary:Lawrence H. 'Larry' Johnston, 93, Moscow |accessdate=August 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were awarded US Patents  2,555,101  and  2,585,855 for it.&lt;ref name="asa"/&gt;

While a graduate student at Berkeley, Johnston met Mildred (Millie) Hillis, a girl who shared his strong Christian faith. When Alvarez discovered how much Johnston missed Hillis, he arranged for Johnston to be flown back to Berkeley. Johnston and Hillis married, and returned to Boston together. She sometimes accompanied them on field trips to test the ground-controlled approach radar system. They had five children: Mary Virginia (Ginger), Margy, Dan, Lois, and Karen.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;

===Manhattan Project===
[[File:Lawrence Johnston with Fat man core.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Johnston with the [[Fat Man]] [[plutonium core]] on [[Tinian]] in 1945]]
In 1944, Johnston followed Alvarez to the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], where [[Robert Oppenheimer]], who was also from the University of California, was the director. Johnston became involved in the development of the [[Fat Man]] [[plutonium]] bomb. Because of the high level of [[spontaneous fission]] in reactor plutonium, it was decided to use a nearly critical sphere of the metal and compress it quickly into a much smaller and denser [[plutonium core|core]] using explosives, a technical challenge at the time.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=123–128}}

To create the symmetrical [[nuclear weapon design|implosion]] required to compress the plutonium to the required density, thirty-two explosive charges were simultaneously detonated around the spherical core. Using conventional explosive techniques with [[blasting cap]]s, progress towards achieving simultaneity to within a small fraction of a microsecond was discouraging. Alvarez directed Johnston to use a large [[capacitor]] to deliver a [[high voltage]] charge directly to each [[explosive lens]], replacing blasting caps with [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s. This detonated all thirty-two charges within a few tenths of a microsecond. The invention was critical to the success of the [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]].{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=131–136}} Johnston was awarded US Patent 3,040,660 for the exploding-bridgewire detonator.&lt;ref name="asa"/&gt;

Johnston and Alvarez's next task for the Manhattan Project was to develop a set of calibrated [[microphone]]/[[transmitter]]s to be parachuted from an aircraft to measure the strength of the blast wave from the atomic explosion, so as to allow the scientists to calculate the bomb's energy. He observed the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] from a [[B-29 Superfortress]] that also carried fellow [[Project Alberta]] members  [[Harold Agnew]] and [[Deak Parsons]].{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=137–142}}

Flying in the B-29 Superfortress ''[[The Great Artiste]]'' in formation with the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', Alvarez and Johnston measured the blast effect of the [[Little Boy]] bomb which was [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Hiroshima]].{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=6–8}} A few days later, again flying in ''The Great Artiste'', Johnston used the same equipment to measure the strength of the [[Nagasaki bomb|Nagasaki]] explosion.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=144–146}} He was the only person to witness the Trinity test and the bombings of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;

Johnston never regretted the part he had played in the bombings. Years later, Johnston recalled:{{quote|
Back at Los Alamos there was lots of rejoicing. "We won the War!"  But several important people were having pangs of conscience, most notably Oppenheimer.  Yes we had stopped the wartime killing, but we had killed a lot of people with our bombs, and worst of all we had let the genie out of the bottle, and now nuclear war would be a specter for the world to face.  … Oppie felt especially responsible for this nuclear worry, and he made public statements of remorse.  I think it was because of this that Oppie was forgiven by the 1945 Peace Activists in the Physics community.  Instead he became their hero. But Alvarez was not forgiven, and he suffered public insults as a warmonger.  The same for Ernest Lawrence.  The Peace activists sounded like they wished we had lost the war, or at least that it had ended in a bloody stalemate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2011/12/06/r-i-p-paul-doty-and-lawrence-h-johnston/ |title=R.I.P.: Paul Doty and Lawrence H. Johnston |accessdate=August 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==After the war==
After the war, Johnston returned to graduate school at Berkeley. Under Alvarez's supervision, he wrote his PhD thesis at the [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] on the "Development of the Alvarez-type proton linear accelerator". After he graduated in 1950, he became an associate professor at the [[University of Minnesota]]. There, he built a 68&amp;nbsp;MeV proton linear accelerator, which he used to perform proton-proton scattering experiments. In 1964, he joined the Physics Laboratory of [[The Aerospace Corporation]], where he learned techniques for investigating [[far infrared]] radiation.&lt;ref name="asa"/&gt;

In 1964, Johnston moved to the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] as head of the Electronics Department. He worked there on the construction of a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}}, 20&amp;nbsp;GeV electron linear accelerator. He became a professor of physics at the [[University of Idaho]] in 1967, and focused on nuclear physics, [[Far-infrared laser|far infrared lasers]], and [[Emission spectrum|molecular spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=vitaui/&gt; Johnston retired in 1988 at age 70, and continued to reside in Moscow as professor emeritus until his death.&lt;ref name="asa"/&gt;

In retirement, Johnston made a number of trips to Israel to work on biblical archaeology projects. He was a strong supporter of Christian ministries, and believed in [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref name="asa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt; Johnston died of [[lung cancer]] at age 93 in his home in Moscow on December 4, 2011. Married for 69 years, he was survived by his wife Millie and their five children.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;

With the issue of supplying water to a very large population, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] developed hydraulic systems for multiple applications: public water supply, power using water mills, [[hydraulic mining]], fish tanks, irrigation, fire fighting, and of course [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] (Stein 2004). Scientists such as [[Ctesibius]] and [[Archimedes]] produced the first inventions involving hydraulic power (Oleson 1984). 

==Specific technology==
The most prevalent hydraulic pump used in maritime situations in [[ancient Rome]] was the [[bilge pump]], which functioned to siphon collected water out of a ship’s hull (Oleson 1984). The bilge pump was an improvement on the first hydraulic pumps used in antiquity: force pumps. Invented around the early 3rd century BCE, the most primitive design of a force pump consisted of a piston pushing water out of a tube, constructed by soldering individual bronze elements (Stein 246). 

Written accounts from Phil of Byzantium (late 3rd century BCE), Vitruvius (c. 25 BCE), and Hero of Alexandria (c. CE 50) confirm archaeological evidence for the original simple design, and both Hero and Vitruvius specify that the pump was typically made of bronze (Stein 2004). Somewhere along the way a new design arose that involved cutting apertures into an individual wood block and then rendering the block pressure-proof with tightly fitting plugs and plates (Stein 2004). 

Although cheaper and easier to manufacture, assemble, and repair, the wooden pumps manufactured from then on would most likely not have been durable enough for maritime use, which is why we usually find lead pipes associated with bilge pumps, bilge wells, and hydraulic devices of other function about ships. The amphora shipwreck discovered at Grado in Gorizia, Italy, which dates to around 200 CE, and contained what archaeologists hypothesized to be a ‘hydraulics’ system to change the water in live fish tanks, since other evidence indicates the ship’s involvement in the processed fish trade (Beltrame and Gaddi 2005).  

This hypothesis has been disputed, since the wooden box protecting a lead pipe along the longitudinal axis of the hull found on the wreck suggest the existence of a bilge well (Oleson and Stein 2007). Previous ships involved in live fish tank transport, entitled navis vivariae, did not employ a hydraulic system, and for this reason the hypothesis proves especially questionable (Boetto 124). For example, one of the wrecks found in Claudius’s harbor at the modern Fiumicino Airport in Italy was a small fish craft dating somewhere around the 2nd century CE. Archaeologists discovered a fish-well in the middle of the ship that used the hole/plump system bored in the bottom of the boat to fill the tank (Boetto 2006). Other than the Grado wreck no other evidence exists of hydraulic systems being used in the fish industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3042">'''Multi-function material''' is a [[composite material]]. The traditional approach to the development of structures is to address the loadcarrying function and other functional requirements separately. Recently, however, there has been increased interest in the development of load-bearing materials and structures which have integral non-load-bearing functions, guided by recent discoveries about how multifunctional [[biological system]]s work.&lt;ref&gt;A review of recent research on mechanics of multifunctional composite, Journal of Composite Structures 92 (2010) 2793–2810&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
With conventional structural materials, it has been difficult to achieve simultaneous improvement in multiple structural functions, but the increasing use of [[composite material]]s has been driven in part by the potential for such improvements. The multi-functions can vary from mechanical to electrical and thermal functions. The most widely used composites have polymer matrix materials, which are typically poor conductors. Enhanced conductivity could be achieved with reinforcing the composite with [[carbon nanotubes]] for instance.&lt;ref&gt;"Sensors and actuators based on carbon nanotubes and their composite" J. Composites Science and Technology 68 (2008) 1227–1249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Challenges and opportunities in multifunctional nanocomposite structures for aerospace applications. MRS Bull 2007;32(4):324-34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Among the many functions that can be attained are Electrical/thermal conductivity, Sensing and actuation, Energy harvesting/storage, Self-healing capability, Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and recyclability and biodegradability. See also [[Functionally graded material| Functionally graded materials (FGM)]] which are [[composite materials]] where the composition or the microstructure are locally varied so that a certain variation of the local material properties is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeaw.ac.at/esi/english/research/materials/comp/fgms.html O. Kolednik, Functionally Graded Materials, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820130401/http://www.oeaw.ac.at/esi/english/research/materials/comp/fgms.html |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, FGM can be designed for specific function and applications.

Many applications such as Re-configurable aircraft wings, shape-changing aerodynamic panels for flow control, Variable geometry engine exhausts, turbine blade, wind turbine configuration at different wind speed, Microelectromechanical systems (micro-switches), mechanical memory cells, valves, micropumps,Flexible direction panel position in solar cells,Innovative architecture (adaptive shape panels for roofs and windows), Flexible and foldable electronic devices and Optics (shape changing mirrors for active focusing in adaptive optical systems)

==Background==
Hayles was born in [[Saint Louis, Missouri]] to Edward and Thelma Bruns. She received her [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[Chemistry]] from the  [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] in 1966, and her [[Master's degree|M.S.]] in Chemistry from the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1969. She worked as a research chemist in 1966 at [[Xerox Corporation]] and as a chemical research consultant [[Beckman Coulter|Beckman Instrument Company]] from 1968-1970. Hayles then switched fields and received her [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in [[English Literature]] from [[Michigan State University]] in 1970, and her [[Ph.D.]] in English Literature from the [[University of Rochester]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=Gale2004&gt;Gale 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; She is a social and literary critic.

==Career==
Her scholarship primarily focuses on the "relations between science, literature, and technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~iareview/tirweb/feature/hayles/hayles.htm|title=Iowa Review Web|website=uiowa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townsendcenter.berkeley.edu/avenali_hayles.shtml|title=N.

==Key concepts==

===Human and posthuman===
Hayles understands "[[human]]" and "[[posthuman]]" as constructions that emerge from historically specific understandings of technology, culture and embodiment; "human and "posthuman" views each produce unique models of subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;N. Katherine Hayles, ''How We Became Posthuman:Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature and Informatics'', (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999)', 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this framework "human" is aligned with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] notions of [[humanism|liberal humanism]], including its emphasis on the "natural self" and the freedom of the individual.&lt;ref name="Hayles, Posthuman, 3"&gt;Hayles, ''Posthuman'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, posthuman does away with the notion of a "natural" self and emerges when human intelligence is conceptualized as being co-produced with intelligent machines. According to Hayles the posthuman view privileges information over materiality, considers consciousness as an epiphenomenon and imagines the body as a prosthesis for the mind .&lt;ref&gt;Hayles, ''Posthuman'',2.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically Hayles suggests that in the posthuman view "there are no essential differences or absolute demarcations between bodily existence and computer simulation..."&lt;ref name="Hayles, Posthuman, 3"/&gt; The posthuman thus emerges as a deconstruction of the liberal humanist notion of "human." Hayles disregards the idea of a form of immortality created through the preservation of human knowledge with computers, instead opting for a specification within the definition of posthuman that one embraces the possibilities of information technology without the imagined concepts of infinite power and immortality, tropes often associated with technology and dissociated with traditional humanity. This idea of the posthuman also ties in with cybernetics in the creation of the feedback loop that allows humans to interact with technology through a blackbox, linking the human and the machine as one. Thus, Hayles links this to an overall cultural perception of virtuality and a priority on information rather than materiality.

===Embodiment and materiality===
Despite drawing out the differences between "human" and "posthuman", Hayles is careful to note that both perspectives engage in the erasure of embodiment from subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Hayles, ''Posthuman'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In the liberal humanist view, cognition takes precedence over the body, which is narrated as an object to possess and master. Meanwhile, popular conceptions of the cybernetic posthuman imagine the body as merely a container for information and code. Noting the alignment between these two perspectives, Hayles uses ''How We Became Posthuman'' to investigate the social and cultural processes and practices that led to the conceptualization of information as separate from the material that instantiates it.&lt;ref&gt;Hayles,''Posthuman', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on diverse examples, such as [[Alan Turing|Turing's]] [[Imitation Game (Turing test)|Imitation Game]], [[William Gibson|Gibson's]] ''[[Neuromancer]]'' and [[cybernetics|cybernetic theory]], Hayles traces the history of what she calls "the cultural perception that information and materiality are conceptually distinct and that information is in some sense more essential, more important and more fundamental than materiality."&lt;ref&gt;Hayles, ''Posthuman'',18.&lt;/ref&gt; By tracing the emergence of such thinking, and by looking at the manner in which literary and scientific texts came to imagine, for example, the possibility of downloading human consciousness into a computer, Hayles attempts to trouble the information/material separation and in her words, "...put back into the picture the flesh that continues to be erased  in contemporary discussions about cybernetic subjects.”&lt;ref&gt;Hayles, ''Posthuman'', 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, the posthuman subject under the condition of virtuality is an "amalgam, a collection of heterogeneous components, a material-informational entity whose boundaries undergo continuous construction and reconstruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Posthuman|last=Hayles|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayles differentiates "embodiment" from the concept of "the body" because "in contrast to the body, embodiment is contextual, enmeshed within the specifics of place, time, physiology, and culture, which together compose enactment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Posthuman|last=Hayles|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayles specifically examines how various science fiction novels portray a shift in the conception of information, particularly in the dialectics of presence/absence toward pattern/randomness. She diagrams these shifts to show how ideas about abstraction and information actually have a "local habitation" and are "embodied" within the narratives. Although ideas about "information" taken out of context creates abstractions about the human "body", reading science fiction situates these same ideas in "embodied" narrative."

==Scholarly Reception==
Within the field of Posthuman Studies, Hayles' ''How We Became Posthuman'' is considered "the key text which brought [[posthumanism]] to broad international attention".&lt;ref name="Ferrando, 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferrando|first=Francesca|title=Posthumanism|journal=Kilden Journal of Gender Research|date=2014|ISSN=0809-6341|volume=2|pages=168–172|url=https://www.academia.edu/8041656/POSTHUMANISM|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years since this book was published, it has been both praised and critiqued by scholars who have viewed her work through a variety of lenses; including those of cybernetic history, feminism, postmodernism, cultural and literary criticism, and conversations in the popular press about humans' changing relationships to technology.

===Writing Style, Organization, and Scope===
Reactions to Hayles' writing style, general organization, and scope of the book have been mixed. The book is generally praised for displaying depth and scope in its combining of scientific ideas and [[literary criticism]]. Linda Brigham of [[Kansas State University]] claims that Hayles manages to lead the text "across diverse, historically contentious terrain by means of a carefully crafted and deliberate organizational structure."&lt;ref name="Brigham, 1999"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.altx.com/ebr/reviews/rev9/r9bri.htm|title = Are We Posthuman Yet?|date = Spring 1999|accessdate = 12 October 2015|website = [[Electronic Book Review]]|publisher = |last = Brigham|first = Linda|issn = 1553-1139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars found her prose difficult to read or over-complicated.

===Reception of Feminist Ideas===
Several scholars reviewing ''How We Became Posthuman'' highlighted the strengths and shortcomings of her book vis a vis its relationship to [[feminism]]. [[Amelia Jones]] of [[University of Southern California]] describes Hayles' work as reacting to the misogynistic discourse of the field of [[cybernetics]].&lt;ref name="Jones, 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = [Review of How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics by N. Katherine Hayles]|jstor = 3175794|journal = Signs|date = 2002-01-01|pages = 565–569|volume = 27|issue = 2|first = Amelia|last = Jones|publisher = University of Chicago Press | doi = 10.1086/495699}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Pickering wrote, Hayles' promotion of an "embodied [[posthumanism]]" challenges [[cybernetics]]' "equation of human-ness with disembodied information" for being "another male trick to feminists tired of the devaluation of women's bodily labor."&lt;ref name="Pickering, 2000" /&gt; Stephanie Turner of [[Purdue University]] also described Hayles' work as an opportunity to challenge prevailing concepts of the human subject which assumed the body was white, male, and European, but suggested Hayles' dialectic method may have taken too many interpretive risks, leaving some questions open about "which interventions promise the best directions to take."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics (review)|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern_fiction_studies/v045/45.4turner.html|journal = MFS Modern Fiction Studies|date = 1999-01-01|issn = 1080-658X|pages = 1096–1098|volume = 45|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/mfs.1999.0096|first = Stephanie S.|last = Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception of Hayles' Construction of the Posthuman Subject===
Reviewers were mixed about Hayles' construction of the [[posthuman]] subject. Weiss describes Hayles' work as challenging the simplistic dichotomy of human and post-human subjects in order to "rethink the relationship between human beings and intelligent machines," however suggests that in her attempt to set her vision of the posthuman apart from the "realist, objectivist epistemology characteristic of first-wave cybernetics", she too, falls back on [[universalist]] discourse, premised this time on how cognitive science is able to reveal the "true nature of the self."&lt;ref name="Weiss, 2000" /&gt; Jones similarly described Hayles' work as reacting to cybernetics' disembodiment of the human subject by swinging too far towards an insistence on a "physical reality" of the body apart from discourse. Jones argued that reality is rather "determined in and through the way we view, articulate, and understand the world".&lt;ref name="Jones, 2002" /&gt;

===Materiality of Information===
In terms of the strength of Hayles' arguments regarding the return of materiality to information, several scholars expressed doubt on the validity of the provided grounds, notably [[evolutionary psychology]]. Keating claims that while Hayles is following evolutionary psychological arguments in order to argue for the overcoming of the disembodiment of knowledge, she provides "no good reason to support this proposition."&lt;ref name="Keating, 2000" /&gt; Brigham describes Hayles' attempt to connect [[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]] circularity to "an inadequacy in [[Humberto Maturana|Maturana]]'s attempt to account for evolutionary change" as unjustified.&lt;ref name="Brigham, 1999" /&gt; Weiss suggests that she makes the mistake of "adhering too closely to the realist, objectivist discourse of the sciences," the same mistake she criticizes Weiner and Maturana for committing.&lt;ref name="Weiss, 2000" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12101">The '''expansive force of [[rust]]ing''', which may be called '''oxide jacking''' or '''rust burst''', is a phenomenon that can cause damage to structures made of stone, masonry, concrete or ceramics, and reinforced with metal components.  A definition is "the displacement of building elements due to the expansion of iron and steel products as the metal rusts and becomes iron oxide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Physical process==

According to [[Metallurgy|metallurgist]] Jack Harris, "Oxidation is usually accompanied by a net expansion so that when it occurs in a confined space stresses are generated in the metal component itself or in any surrounding medium such as stone or cement. So much energy is released by oxidation that the stresses generated are of sufficient magnitude to deform or fracture all known materials."&lt;ref name=Harris2&gt;{{cite journal

As early as 1915, it was recognized that certain modern metal alloys are more susceptible to excessive [[Oxidation state|oxidation]] when subjected to [[weathering]] than other metals.  At that time, there was a trend to replace [[wrought iron]] fasteners with  [[Carbon steel#Mild and low carbon steel|mild steel]] equivalents, which were less expensive. Unexpectedly, the mild steel fasteners failed in real world use much more quickly than anticipated, leading to a return to use of wrought iron in certain applications where length of service was important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In a 1987 article in ''[[New Scientist]]'', Jack Harris reported that oxide jacking has caused significant damage to many historic structures in the United Kingdom, including [[St Paul's Cathedral]], the [[British Museum]] and the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, [[Gloucester Cathedral]], [[List of buildings in King's Lynn#St Margaret's Church|St. Margaret's Church]] in [[King's Lynn]], [[Winchester Cathedral]], and [[Blackburn Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite news

Harris also wrote that oxide jacking also damaged the ancient [[Horses of Saint Mark]] on the exterior of [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]].  Expansive rusting of iron and steel bolts and reinforcements affected the structural integrity of the copper horse sculptures, which were relocated indoors and replaced with replicas.  Poorly-designed early 20th-century renovations also led to oxide jacking damage to the [[Acropolis of Athens]].&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt;

In the United States, rusting of iron pegs inserted into holes in the stone entrance stair in order to support [[handrails]] resulted in cracking of the steps at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Oxide jacking damaged the [[terra cotta]] [[cornice]] on the [[Land Title Building]] in [[Philadelphia]], designed in 1897 and expanded in 1902 by pioneer skyscraper architect [[Daniel Burnham]].&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt; The Land Title complex, with its two interconnected towers, is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  By 1922, experts on architectural terra cotta were warning that the rusting of embedded iron fasteners could cause decorative building components to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Flooding in 2007 damaged the modernist [[Farnsworth House]] in [[Plano, Illinois]], designed in 1945 by [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], and now owned by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].  Among the damage discovered by an architect inspecting the house in 2007 was oxide jacking at the corners of the house's steel framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Damage to reinforced concrete bridges and buildings==

Structures built of [[concrete]] and reinforced with metal [[rebar]] are also subject to damage by oxide jacking. Expansion of corroded rebar causes [[spall]]ing of the concrete.  Structures exposed to a marine environment, or where [[Sodium chloride#Road salt|salt]] is used for [[Snow removal#De-icing and anti-icing|de-icing]] purposes, are especially susceptible to this type of damage.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt;

Research in the 1960s showed that 22% of concrete bridge decks in [[Pennsylvania]] showed signs of spalling due to oxide jacking within four years of construction.  Oxide jacking caused widespread damage to concrete [[council houses]] built in the United Kingdom in the post World War II era.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt;

According to an expert in the field, the problem resulted in "intensive worldwide research into the causes and repair of reinforcement corrosion, which in turn led to a vast output of research papers, conferences and publications on the subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Damage to stone countertops==
[[Countertop]] components fabricated out of [[granite]] and other natural stones are sometimes reinforced with metal rods inserted into grooves cut into the underside of the stone, and bonded in place with various resins.  This procedure is called "rodding" by countertop fabricators.  Most commonly, these rods will be placed near [[sink]] cutouts to prevent cracking of the brittle stone countertop during transportation and installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, if a metal rod subject to [[Oxidation state|oxidation]] or other forms of [[corrosion]] is used, and moisture from a [[sink]] or [[Tap (valve)|faucet]] reaches the rod, oxide jacking can crack the countertop directly above the rod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Skilled stone repair professionals can disassemble the cracked stone, remove the metal rod, and reassemble the stone using various resins tinted to match the colors of the stone.&lt;ref name=Beware/&gt;  This type of problem can be prevented by using reinforcing rods made of [[stainless steel]] or [[fiberglass]] in the rodding procedure.&lt;ref name=Beware/&gt;

===Active and passive components===
In electrical engineering, [[electric power|power]] represents the rate of electrical energy flowing into or out of a given component or [[control volume]].  Power is a [[signed number|signed quantity]]; negative power just represents power flowing in the opposite direction from positive power.  From the standpoint of power flow, [[electrical component]]s in a circuit can be divided into two types:&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt;    
*In a ''load'' or ''[[Passivity (engineering)|passive]]'' component, such as a [[light bulb]], [[resistor]], or [[electric motor]], [[electric current]] ([[conventional current]], flow of positive charges) moves through the device under the influence of the [[electric field]] ''E'' in the direction of lower [[electric potential]], from the positive terminal to the negative.  So work is done ''by'' the charges ''on'' the component; potential energy flows out of the charges; and electric power flows from the circuit into the component, where it is converted to some other form of energy such as heat or mechanical work. 
*In a ''source'' or ''[[Passivity (engineering)|active]]'' component, such as a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[electric generator]], current is forced to move through the device in the direction of greater electric potential, from the negative to the positive voltage terminal.  This increases the potential energy of the electric charges, so electric power flows out of the component into the circuit.  [[work (electrical)|Work]] must be done ''on'' the moving charges by some source of energy in the component, to make them move in this direction against the opposing force of the [[electric field]] ''E''.    
Some components can be either a source or a load, depending on the voltage or current through them.  For example, a [[rechargeable battery]] acts as a source when it is used to produce power, but as a load when it is being recharged.

Since it can flow in either direction, there are two possible ways to define electric power; two possible ''reference directions'': either power flowing into an electrical component, or power flowing out of the component, can be defined as positive.&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt; Whichever is defined as positive, the other will be negative.  The passive sign convention arbitrarily defines power flowing ''out'' of the circuit (''into'' the component) as positive,&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt; so passive components have "positive" power flow.

In an AC ([[alternating current]]) circuit the current and voltage switch direction with each half-cycle of the current, but the definitions above still apply; at any given instant, in passive components the current flows from the positive terminal to the negative, while in active components it flows the other direction.

===Reference directions===
The power flow '''''p''''' and [[electrical resistance|resistance]] '''''r''''' of an electrical component are related to the voltage '''''v''''' and current '''''i''''' variables by the defining equation for power and [[Ohm's law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;p = vi \qquad\qquad\qquad\,\,\, (1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r = v/i \qquad\qquad\qquad (2)  \,&lt;/math&gt; 
Like power, voltage and current are signed quantities.  The current flow in a wire has two possible directions, so when defining a current variable '''''i''''' the direction which represents positive current flow must be indicated, usually by an arrow on the circuit diagram.&lt;ref name="O'Malley"&gt;{{cite book

Similarly in defining a variable '''''v''''' representing the voltage between two terminals, the terminal which represents the positive side must be specified, usually with a plus sign.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;  This is called the ''reference direction for voltage '''v'''''.&lt;ref name="O'Malley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; If the terminal marked positive actually has a lower voltage than the other one, then the variable '''''v''''' will have a negative value.

To understand the passive sign convention, it is important to distinguish the reference directions of the variables, '''''v''''' and '''''i''''', which can be assigned at will, from the direction of the actual ''voltage'' and ''current'', which is determined by the circuit.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;  The idea of the PSC is that by assigning the reference direction of variables '''''v''''' and '''''i'''''  in a component with the right relationship, the power flow in passive components calculated from Eq. (1) will come out positive, while the power flow in active components will come out negative.  It is not necessary to know whether a component produces or consumes power when analyzing the circuit; reference directions can be assigned arbitrarily, directions to currents and polarities to voltages, then the PSC is used to calculate the power in components.&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt;  If the power comes out positive, the component is a load, consuming electric power and converting it to some other kind of power.  If the power comes out negative, the component is a source, converting some other form of power to electric power.

===Sign conventions===
The above discussion shows that choosing the relative direction of the voltage and current variables in a component determines the direction of power flow that is considered positive.  The reference directions of the individual variables are not important, only their relation to each other.  There are two choices: 
[[File:Passive sign convention.svg|right|130px|upright=0.5]]
*'''''Passive sign convention''''': Defining the current variable as entering the positive terminal means that if the voltage and current variables have positive values, current flows from the positive to the negative terminal, doing work ''on'' the component, as occurs in a passive component.  So power flowing ''into'' the component from the line is defined as positive; the power variable represents power ''dissipation'' in the component.  Therefore   
**Active components (power sources) will have negative resistance and negative power flow 
**Passive components (loads) will have positive resistance and positive power flow  
:This is the convention normally used. 
[[File:Active sign convention.svg|right|130px]]
*'''''Active sign convention''''': Defining the current variable as entering the negative terminal means that if the voltage and current variables have positive values, current flows from the negative to the positive terminal, so work is being done ''on'' the current, and power flows ''out'' of the component.  So power flowing out of the component is defined as positive; the power variable represents power ''produced''.  Therefore: 
**Active components will have positive resistance and positive power flow
**Passive components will have negative resistance and negative power flow  
:This convention is rarely used, except for special cases in power engineering.

In practice it is not necessary to assign the voltage and current variables in a circuit to comply with the PSC.  Components in which the variables have a "backward" relationship, in which the current variable enters the negative terminal, can still be made to comply with the PSC by changing the sign of the constitutive relations (1) and (2) used with them.&lt;ref name="Jamid" /&gt;   A current entering the negative terminal is equivalent to a  negative current entering the positive terminal, so in such a component&lt;ref name="Jamid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prasad" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p = v(-i) = -vi  \,&lt;/math&gt;, and

:&lt;math&gt;r = v/(-i) = -v/i \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Conservation of energy==
One advantage of defining all the variables in a circuit to comply with the PSC is that it makes it easy to express [[conservation of energy]].   Since electric energy cannot be created or destroyed, at any given instant every watt of power consumed by a load component must be produced by some source component in the circuit.  Therefore the sum of all the power consumed by loads equals the sum of all the power produced by sources.   Since with the PSC the power dissipation in sources is negative and power dissipation in loads is positive, the sum of all the power dissipation in all the components in a circuit is always zero&lt;ref name="Prasad" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_n p_n = \sum_n v_n i_n = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

==AC circuits==
Since the sign convention only deals with the directions of the ''variables'' and not with the direction of the actual ''current'', it also applies to [[alternating current]] (AC) circuits, in which the direction of the voltage and current periodically reverses.  In AC circuits, even though the voltage and current reverse direction, a "formal" direction of current flow and voltage polarity are defined by considering the voltage and current direction in the first half of the cycle "positive".  During the second half of the AC cycle, in a resistive AC circuit, both the voltage and current in the device reverse direction, so the sign of the voltage and current reverse.  Since the power is the product of voltage and current, the two sign reversals cancel each other, and the sign of the power flow is unchanged.

==Alternative convention in power engineering==
In practice, the power output of power sources such as batteries and generators is not given in negative numbers, as required by the passive sign convention.&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt;   No manufacturer sells a "&amp;minus;5&amp;nbsp;kilowatt generator".&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt;   The standard practice in electric power circuits is to use positive values for the power and resistance of power sources, as well as loads.   This avoids confusion over the meaning of "negative power", and particularly "[[negative resistance]]".&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt;   In order to make the power for both sources and loads come out positive, instead of the PSC, separate sign conventions must be used for sources and loads.  These are called the "''generator-load conventions''"&lt;ref name="Glover"&gt;{{cite book

*'''Generator convention''' - In source components like [[Electric generator|generators]] and batteries, the variables '''''V''''' and '''''I''''' are defined according to the ''active sign convention'' above; the current variable is defined as entering the negative terminal of the device.&lt;ref name="Lukman" /&gt;
*'''Load convention''' -  In loads, the variables are defined according to the normal passive sign convention; the current variable is defined as entering the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Lukman" /&gt;
Using this convention, positive power flow in source components is power ''produced'', while positive power flow in load components is power ''consumed''. 
As with the PSC, if the variables in a given component do not conform to the applicable convention, the component can still be made to conform by using negative signs in the constitutive equations (1) and (2)
:::&lt;math&gt;P = -VI \,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;R = -V/I \,&lt;/math&gt;

This convention may seem preferable to the PSC, since the power ''P'' and resistance ''R'' always have positive values.     However it cannot be used in [[electronics]], because it is not possible to classify some electronic components unambiguously as "sources" or "loads".   Some electronic components may act as sources of power with [[negative resistance]] in some portions of their operating range, and as absorbers of power with positive resistance in other portions, or even in different portions of the AC cycle.  The power consumption or production of a component depends on its [[current-voltage characteristic|current-voltage characteristic curve]].  Whether the component acts as a source or load may depend on the current '''''i''''' or voltage '''''v''''' in it, which is not known until the circuit is analyzed.   For example, if the voltage across a [[rechargeable battery]]'s terminals is less than its open-circuit voltage, it will act as a source, while if the voltage is greater it will act as a load and recharge.  So it is necessary for power and resistance variables to be able to take on both positive and negative values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7292">'''Position error''' is one of the errors affecting the systems in an aircraft for measuring [[airspeed]] and [[Altitude#Altitude in Aviation|altitude]].&lt;ref&gt;Kermode, A.C.,''Mechanics of Flight'', 10th Edition – page 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;”Of these errors the error in detection of static pressure is generally the most serious and has the special name, ''position error''.”  Dommasch, D.O., Sherby, S.S., and Connolly, T.F. (1967) ''Airplane Aerodynamics'', 4th edition – page 51, Pitman Publishing Corp., New York&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not practical or necessary for an aircraft to have an airspeed indicating system and an altitude indicating system that are exactly accurate.  A small amount of error is tolerable. It is caused by the location of the static vent that supplies the altimeter.

== Static system ==

All aircraft are equipped with a small hole in the surface of the aircraft called the static port.  The air pressure in the vicinity of the static port is conveyed by a [[Electrical conduit|conduit]] to the [[altimeter]] and the [[airspeed indicator]].  This static port and the conduit constitute the aircraft's static system.  The objective of the static system is to sense the pressure of the air at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying.  In an ideal static system the air pressure fed to the altimeter and airspeed indicator is equal to the pressure of the air at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying.

As the air flows past an aircraft in flight, the streamlines are affected by the presence of the aircraft, and the speed of the air relative to the aircraft is different at different positions on the aircraft's outer surface.  In consequence of [[Bernoulli's principle]], the different speeds of the air result in different pressures at different positions on the aircraft's surface.&lt;ref&gt;”It is virtually impossible to find a position where the static pressure is always exactly the same as the pressure in the free airstream away from the aircraft”. Kermode, A.C., ''Mechanics of Flight'', 10th edition – page 65&lt;/ref&gt;  The ideal position for a static port is a position where the local air pressure in flight is always equal to the pressure remote from the aircraft, however there is no position on an aircraft where this ideal situation exists for all [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]].  When deciding on a position for a static port, aircraft designers attempt to find a position where the error between static pressure and free-stream pressure is a minimum across the operating range of angle of attack of the aircraft.  The residual error at any given angle of attack is called the '''position error'''.
&lt;ref&gt;”The amount by which the local static pressure at a given point in the flow field differs from free-stream static pressure is called the ''position error'' of the installation.” [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930092348_1993092348.pdf Measurement of Static Pressure on Aircraft] NACA, TR-1364, p.646&lt;/ref&gt;

Position error affects the [[indicated airspeed]] and the indicated [[Altitude#Altitude in Aviation|altitude]].  Aircraft manufacturers use the aircraft flight manual to publish details of the error in indicated airspeed and indicated altitude across the operating range of speeds.  In many aircraft, the effect of position error on airspeed is shown as the difference between [[indicated airspeed]] and [[calibrated airspeed]].  In some low-speed aircraft, the position error is shown as the difference between [[indicated airspeed]] and [[equivalent airspeed]].

== Pitot system ==

[[Bernoulli's principle]] states that total pressure (or [[stagnation pressure]]) is constant along a streamline.&lt;ref&gt;Providing the streamline does not enter a boundary layer, pass through a shock wave or undergo a major change in height so that gravitational potential energy changes are significant.  These three factors are absent when considering the Pitot-static system in a subsonic aircraft.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no variation in stagnation pressure, regardless of the position on the streamline where it is measured.  There is no position error associated with stagnation pressure.

The [[Pitot tube]] supplies pressure to the [[airspeed indicator]].  Pitot pressure is equal to stagnation pressure providing the Pitot tube is aligned with the local airflow, it is located outside the boundary layer, and outside the wash from the propeller.  Pitot pressure can suffer alignment error but it is not vulnerable to position error.

== Aircraft design standards ==

Aircraft design standards specify a maximum amount of [[Pitot-static system]] error.    The error in indicated altitude must not be excessive because it is important for pilots to know their altitude with reasonable accuracy for the purpose of traffic separation.  US [[Federal Aviation Regulations]], Part 23,&lt;ref&gt;Airworthiness Standards: Normal, Utility, Acrobatic, and Commuter Category Airplanes&lt;/ref&gt; §23.1325(e) includes the following requirement for the static pressure system:
*The system error, in indicated pressure altitude, ..., may not exceed ±30 feet per 100 knot speed for the [operating speed range for the aircraft].

The error in indicated airspeed must also not be excessive.  Part 23, §23.1323(b) includes the following requirement for the airspeed indicating system:
*The system error, including position error, ..., may not exceed three percent of the calibrated airspeed or five knots, whichever is greater, throughout the [operating speed range for the aircraft].

== Measuring position error ==

For the purpose of complying with an aircraft design standard that specifies a maximum permissible error in the airspeed indicating system it is necessary to measure the position error in a representative aircraft.  There are many different methods for measuring position error.  Some of the more common methods are:
* use of a [[Global Navigation Satellite System|GNSS]] receiver while flying a triangular course
* trailing conduit with static source, stabilized by a plastic cone
* tower fly-by with photographs of the passing aircraft taken from the tower to accurately show the height of the aircraft above or below the tower
* trailing bob with both Pitot and static sources

'''Public-key cryptography''', or '''asymmetric cryptography''', is any cryptographic system that uses pairs of [[cryptographic key|keys]]: ''public keys'' which may be disseminated widely, and ''private keys'' which are known only to the owner.  This accomplishes two functions: [[Authentication protocol|authentication]], where the public key verifies that a holder of the paired private key sent the message, and [[encryption]], where only the paired private key holder can [[Decrypting|decrypt]] the message encrypted with the public key.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a public key encryption system, any person can encrypt a message using the receiver's public key. That encrypted message can only be decrypted with the receiver's private key. To be practical, the generation of a public and private key -pair must be computationally economical. The strength of a public key cryptography system relies on the computational effort (''work factor'' in cryptography) required to find the private key from its paired public key. Effective security only requires keeping the private key private; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dam9zrViJjEC|title=Cryptography and Network Security: Principles and Practice|last=Stallings|first=William|date=1990-05-03|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780138690175|page=165|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public key cryptography systems often rely on [[cryptographic]] [[algorithms]] based on [[mathematical]] problems that currently admit no efficient solution, particularly those inherent in certain [[integer factorization]], [[discrete logarithm]], and [[Elliptic curve cryptography|elliptic curve]] relationships.  Public key algorithms, unlike [[symmetric key algorithms]], do ''not'' require a [[secure channel]] for the initial [[key exchange|exchange]] of one or more [[secret key]]s between the parties.&lt;ref&gt;See [[OTAR]] to contrast.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the computational complexity of asymmetric encryption, it is usually used only for small blocks of data, typically the transfer of a symmetric encryption key (e.g. a [[session key]]). This symmetric key is then used to encrypt the rest of the potentially long message sequence. The symmetric encryption/decryption is based on simpler algorithms and is much faster.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dam9zrViJjEC|title=Cryptography and Network Security: Principles and Practice|last=Stallings|first=William|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780138690175|page=164|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a public key signature system, a person can combine a message with a private key to create a short ''[[digital signature]]'' on the message.  Anyone with the corresponding public key can combine a message, a putative digital signature on it, and the known public key to verify whether the signature was valid, i.e. made by the owner of the corresponding private key.  Changing the message, even replacing a single letter, will cause verification to fail. In a secure signature system, it is computationally infeasible for anyone who does not know the private key to deduce it from the public key or any number of signatures, or to find a valid signature on any message for which a signature has not hitherto been seen.  Thus the authenticity of a message can be demonstrated by the signature, provided the owner of the private key keeps the private key secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Alfred J.

Public key algorithms are fundamental security ingredients in [[cryptosystem]]s, applications and protocols. They underpin various Internet standards, such as [[Transport Layer Security| Transport Layer Security (TLS)]], [[S/MIME]], [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], and [[GNU Privacy Guard|GPG]]. Some public key algorithms provide [[key distribution]] and secrecy (e.g., [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]]), some provide [[digital signature]]s (e.g., [[Digital Signature Algorithm]]), and some provide both (e.g., [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]).

Public key cryptography finds application in, among others, the [[information technology]] security discipline, [[information security]]. Information security (IS) is concerned with all aspects of protecting electronic information assets against security threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Information Security Resources |publisher=SANS Institute |url=http://www.sans.org/information-security |accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public key cryptography is used as a method of assuring the confidentiality, authenticity and [[non-repudiation|non-repudiability]] of electronic communications and data storage.

==Description==
Two of the best-known uses of public key cryptography are:

* ''Public key encryption'', in which a message is encrypted with a recipient's public key. The message cannot be decrypted by anyone who does not possess the matching private key, who is thus presumed to be the owner of that key and the person associated with the public key. This is used in an attempt to ensure [[confidentiality]].
* ''[[Digital signature]]s'', in which a message is signed with the sender's private key and can be verified by anyone who has access to the sender's public key. This verification proves that the sender had access to the private key, and therefore is likely to be the person associated with the public key. This also ensures that the message has not been tampered with, as a signature is mathematically bound to the message it originally was made with, and verification will fail for practically any other message, no matter how similar to the original message.

An analogy to public key encryption is that of a locked [[Letter box|mail box]] with a mail slot. The mail slot is exposed and accessible to the public – its location (the street address) is, in essence, the public key. Anyone knowing the street address can go to the door and drop a written message through the slot. However, only the person who possesses the key can open the mailbox and read the message.

An analogy for digital signatures is the sealing of an envelope with a personal [[Seal (device)|wax seal]]. The message can be opened by anyone, but the presence of the unique seal authenticates the sender.

A central problem with the use of public key cryptography is confidence/proof that a particular public key is authentic, in that it is correct and belongs to the person or entity claimed, and has not been tampered with or replaced by a malicious third party. The usual approach to this problem is to use a [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI), in which one or more third parties – known as [[certificate authority|certificate authorities]] – certify ownership of key pairs. [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], in addition to being a certificate authority structure, has used a scheme generally called the "[[web of trust]]", which decentralizes such authentication of public keys by a central mechanism, and substitutes individual endorsements of the link between user and public key. To date, no fully satisfactory solution to the "public key authentication problem" has been found.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==History==
During the early [[history of cryptography]], two parties would rely upon a key that they would exchange by means of a secure, but non-cryptographic, method such as a face-to-face meeting or a trusted courier. This key, which both parties kept absolutely secret, could then be used to exchange encrypted messages. A number of significant practical difficulties arise with this approach to [[key distribution|distributing keys]].

In his 1874 book ''The Principles of Science'', [[William Stanley Jevons]]&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, William Stanley, [https://archive.org/stream/principlesofscie00jevorich#page/n166/mode/1up ''The Principles of Science: A Treatise on Logic and Scientific Method''] p. 141, Macmillan &amp; Co., London, 1874, 2nd ed. 1877, 3rd ed. 1879. Reprinted with a foreword by [[Ernst Nagel]], Dover Publications, New York, NY, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Can the reader say what two numbers multiplied together will produce the number 8616460799?&lt;ref&gt;This came to be known as "Jevons's number". The only nontrivial factor pair is 89681 × 96079.&lt;/ref&gt; I think it unlikely that anyone but myself will ever know.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/principlesofscie00jevorich#page/n165/mode/2up ''Principles of Science''], Macmillan &amp; Co., 1874, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here he described the relationship of [[one-way function]]s to cryptography, and went on to discuss specifically the [[factorization]] problem used to create a [[trapdoor function]]. In July 1996, mathematician [[Solomon W. Golomb]] said: "Jevons anticipated a key feature of the RSA Algorithm for public key cryptography, although he certainly did not invent the concept of public key cryptography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/0161-119691884933 |title=ON FACTORING JEVONS' NUMBER |year=1996 |last=Golob |first=Solomon W. |journal=Cryptologia |volume=20 |issue=3 |page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classified discovery===
In 1970, [[James H. Ellis]], a British cryptographer at the UK [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), conceived of the possibility of "non-secret encryption", (now called public key cryptography), but could see no way to implement it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sawer |first=Patrick |title=The unsung genius who secured Britain's computer defences and paved the way for safe online shopping |journal=The Telegraph |date=11 Mar 2016 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/12191473/The-unsung-genius-who-secured-Britains-computer-defences-and-paved-the-way-for-safe-online-shopping.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, his colleague [[Clifford Cocks]] implemented what has become known as the [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA encryption algorithm]], giving a practical method of "non-secret encryption", and in 1974, another GCHQ mathematician and cryptographer, [[Malcolm J. Williamson]], developed what is now known as [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]]. 
The scheme was also passed to the USA's [[National Security Agency]].&lt;ref name="zdnet"/&gt; With a military focus, and low computing power, the power of public key cryptography was unrealised in both organisations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I judged it most important for military use ... if you can share your key rapidly and electronically, you have a major advantage over your opponent. Only at the end of the evolution from [[Tim Berners-Lee|Berners-Lee]] designing an open internet architecture for [[CERN]], its adaptation and adoption for the [[Arpanet]] ... did public key cryptography realise its full potential.

—[[Ralph Benjamin]]&lt;ref name="zdnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/gchq-pioneers-on-birth-of-public-key-crypto/ |title=GCHQ pioneers on birth of public key crypto |author=Tom Espiner |date=26 October 2010 |website=www.zdnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Their discovery was not publicly acknowledged for 27 years, until the research was declassified by the British government in 1997.&lt;ref name=singh&gt;{{cite book |last=Singh |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Singh |title=[[The Code Book]] |publisher=Doubleday |year=1999 |pages=279–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public discovery===
In 1976, an asymmetric key cryptosystem was published by [[Whitfield Diffie]] and [[Martin Hellman]] who, influenced by [[Ralph Merkle]]'s work on public key distribution, disclosed a method of public key agreement. This method of key exchange, which uses [[Finite field#Applications|exponentiation in a finite field]], came to be known as [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]]. This was the first published practical method for establishing a shared secret-key over an authenticated (but not confidential) communications channel without using a prior shared secret. Merkle's "public key-agreement technique" became known as [[Ralph Merkle puzzle cryptographic system|Merkle's Puzzles]], and was invented in 1974 and published in 1978.

In 1977, a generalization of Cocks' scheme was independently invented by [[Ron Rivest]], [[Adi Shamir]] and [[Leonard Adleman]], all then at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. The latter authors published their work in 1978, and the algorithm came to be known as [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]], from their initials. RSA uses [[modular exponentiation|exponentiation modulo]] a product of two very large [[prime number|primes]], to encrypt and decrypt, performing both public key encryption and public key digital signature. Its security is connected to the extreme difficulty of [[integer factorization|factoring large integers]], a problem for which there is no known efficient general technique. In 1979, [[Michael O. Rabin]] published a related [[Rabin cryptosystem|cryptosystem]] that is probably secure as long as the factorization of the public key remains difficult – it remains [[RSA (algorithm)#Integer factorization and RSA problem|an assumption]] that RSA also enjoys this security.

Since the 1970s, a large number and variety of encryption, digital signature, key agreement, and other techniques have been developed in the field of public key cryptography. The [[ElGamal encryption|ElGamal cryptosystem]], invented by [[Taher ElGamal]] relies on the similar and related high level of difficulty of the [[discrete logarithm problem]], as does the closely related [[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]], which was developed at the US [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and published by [[NIST]] as a proposed standard.

The introduction of [[elliptic curve cryptography]] by [[Neal Koblitz]] and [[Victor S. Miller|Victor Miller]], independently and simultaneously in the mid-1980s, has yielded new public key algorithms based on the [[discrete logarithm]] problem. Although mathematically more complex, elliptic curves provide smaller [[key size]]s and faster operations for approximately equivalent estimated security.

==Typical use==

Public key cryptography is often used to secure electronic communication over an open networked environment such as the Internet, without relying on a hidden or covert channel, even for key exchange. Open networked environments are susceptible to a variety of communication security problems, such as [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s and spoofs. Communication security typically includes requirements that the communication must not be readable during transit (preserving confidentiality), the communication must not be modified during transit (preserving the integrity of the communication), the communication must originate from an identified party (sender authenticity), and the recipient must not be able to [[non-repudiation|repudiate]] or deny receiving the communication. Combining public key cryptography with an Enveloped Public Key Encryption (EPKE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a digital envelope? |work=RSA Laboratories |url=http://www.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/standards-initiatives/what-is-a-digital-envelope.htm |accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; method, allows for the secure sending of a communication over an open networked environment.  In other words, even if an adversary listens to an entire conversation including the key exchange, the adversary would not be able to interpret the conversation.

The distinguishing technique used in public key cryptography is the use of asymmetric key algorithms, where a [[key (cryptography)|key]] used by one party to perform encryption is not the same as the key used by another in decryption. Each user has a pair of [[cryptographic key]]s – a public encryption key and a private decryption key. For example, a key pair used for [[digital signature]]s consists of a private signing key and a public verification key. The public key may be widely distributed, while the private key is known only to its proprietor. The keys are related mathematically, but the parameters are chosen so that calculating the private key from the public key is unfeasible.

In contrast, [[symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric key algorithm]]s use a ''single'' secret key, which must be shared and kept private by both the sender (for encryption) and the receiver (for decryption). To use a symmetric encryption scheme, the sender and receiver must securely share a key in advance.

Because symmetric key algorithms are nearly always much less computationally intensive than asymmetric ones, it is common to exchange a key using a [[key-exchange algorithm]], then transmit data using that key and a symmetric key algorithm. [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]], and the [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]]/TLS family of schemes use this procedure, and are thus called ''[[hybrid cryptosystem]]s''.

==Security==
Some encryption schemes can be proven secure on the basis of the presumed difficulty of a mathematical problem, such as [[Integer factorization|factoring]] the product of two large primes or computing [[discrete logarithm]]s. Note that "secure" here has a precise mathematical meaning, and there are multiple different (meaningful) definitions of what it means for an encryption scheme to be "secure". The "right" definition depends on the context in which the scheme will be deployed.

The most obvious application of a public key encryption system is [[confidentiality]] – a message that a sender encrypts using the recipient's public key can be decrypted only by the recipient's paired private key. This assumes, of course, that no flaw is discovered in the basic algorithm used.

Another application in public key cryptography is the [[digital signature]]. Digital signature schemes can be used for sender [[authentication]] and [[non-repudiation]]. The sender computes a digital signature for the message to be sent, then sends the signature (together with the message) to the intended receiver. Digital signature schemes have the property that signatures can be computed only with the knowledge of the correct private key. To verify that a message has been signed by a user and has not been modified, the receiver needs to know only the corresponding public key. In some cases (e.g., [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]), a single algorithm can be used to both encrypt and create digital signatures. In other cases (e.g., [[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]]), each algorithm can only be used for one specific purpose.

To achieve both authentication and confidentiality, the sender should include the recipient's name in the message, sign it using his private key, and then encrypt both the message and the signature using the recipient's public key.

These characteristics can be used to construct many other (sometimes surprising) cryptographic protocols and applications, such as [[Electronic money|digital cash]], [[password-authenticated key agreement]], multi-party key agreement, [[Trusted timestamping|time-stamping services]], non-repudiation protocols, etc.

==Practical considerations==

===Enveloped Public Key Encryption===
Enveloped Public Key Encryption (EPKE) is the method of applying public key cryptography and ensuring that an electronic communication is transmitted confidentially, has the contents of the communication protected against being modified (communication integrity) and cannot be denied from having been sent ([[non-repudiation]]). This is often the method used when securing communication on an open networked environment such by making use of the [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols.

EPKE consists of a two-stage process that includes both Public Key Encryption (PKE) and a digital signature. Both Public Key Encryption and digital signatures make up the foundation of Enveloped Public Key Encryption (these two processes are described in full in their own sections).

For EPKE to work effectively, it is required that:
* Every participant in the communication has their own unique pair of keys. The first key that is required is a public key and the second key that is required is a private key.
* Each person's own private and public keys must be mathematically related where the private key is used to decrypt a communication sent using a public key and vice versa. Some well-known asymmetric encryption algorithms are based on the [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] cryptosystem.
* The private key must be kept absolutely private by the owner, though the public key can be published in a public directory such as with a [[Certificate authority|certification authority]].

To send a message using EPKE, the sender of the message first signs the message using their own private key, this ensures non-repudiation of the message. The sender then encrypts their digitally signed message using the receiver's public key thus applying a digital envelope to the message. This step ensures confidentiality during the transmission of the message. The receiver of the message then uses their private key to decrypt the message thus removing the digital envelope and then uses the sender's public key to decrypt the sender's digital signature. At this point, if the message has been unaltered during transmission, the message will be clear to the receiver.

Due to the computationally complex nature of [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]]-based asymmetric encryption algorithms, the time taken to encrypt large documents or files to be transmitted can be relatively long. To speed up the process of transmission, instead of applying the sender's digital signature to the large documents or files, the sender can rather [[Hash function|hash]] the documents or files using a [[cryptographic hash function]] and then digitally sign the generated hash value, therefore enforcing non-repudiation. Hashing is a much faster computation to complete as opposed to using an RSA-based digital signature algorithm alone. The sender would then sign the newly generated hash value and encrypt the original documents or files with the receiver's public key. The transmission would then take place securely and with confidentiality and non-repudiation still intact. The receiver would then verify the signature and decrypt the encrypted documents or files with their private key.

Note: The sender and receiver do not usually carry out the process mentioned above manually though, but rather rely on sophisticated software to automatically complete the EPKE process.

====Public Key Encryption====
The goal of Public Key Encryption (PKE) is to ensure that the communication being sent is kept confidential during transit.

To send a message using PKE, the sender of the message uses the public key of the receiver to encrypt the contents of the message. The encrypted message is then transmitted electronically to the receiver and the receiver can then use their own matching private key to decrypt the message.

The encryption process of using the receiver's public key is useful for preserving the confidentiality of the message as only the receiver has the matching private key to decrypt the message. Therefore, the sender of the message cannot decrypt the message once it has been encrypted using the receiver's public key. However, PKE does not address the problem of non-repudiation, as the message could have been sent by anyone that has access to the receiver's public key.

====Digital signatures====
{{main article|Digital signature}}
A digital signature is meant to prove a message came from a particular sender;  neither can anyone impersonate the sender nor can the sender deny having sent the message. This is useful for example when making an electronic purchase of shares, allowing the receiver to prove who requested the purchase. Digital signatures do not provide confidentiality for the message being sent.

The message is signed using the sender's private signing key. The digitally signed message is then sent to the receiver, who can then use the sender's public key to verify the signature.

===Certification authority===
In order for Enveloped Public Key Encryption to be as secure as possible, there needs to be a "gatekeeper" of public and private keys, or else anyone could create key pairs and masquerade as the intended sender of a communication, proposing them as the keys of the intended sender. This digital key "gatekeeper" is known as a [[Certificate authority|certification authority]]. A certification authority is a trusted third party that can issue public and private keys, thus certifying public keys. It also works as a depository to store key chain and enforce the trust factor.

===Postal analogies===
An analogy that can be used to understand the advantages of an asymmetric system is to imagine two people, [[Alice and Bob]], who are sending a secret message through the public mail. In this example, Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob, and expects a secret reply from Bob.

With a [[symmetric key algorithm|symmetric key]] system, Alice first puts the secret message in a box, and locks the box using a [[padlock]] to which she has a key. She then sends the box to Bob through regular mail. When Bob receives the box, he uses an identical copy of Alice's key (which he has somehow obtained previously, maybe by a face-to-face meeting) to open the box, and reads the message. Bob can then use the same padlock to send his secret reply.

In an asymmetric key system, Bob and Alice have separate padlocks. First, Alice asks Bob to send his open padlock to her through regular mail, keeping his key to himself. When Alice receives it, she uses it to lock a box containing her message, and sends the locked box to Bob. Bob can then unlock the box with his key and read the message from Alice. To reply, Bob must similarly get Alice's open padlock to lock the box before sending it back to her.

The critical advantage in an asymmetric key system is that Bob and Alice never need to send a copy of their keys to each other. This prevents a third party – perhaps, in this example, a corrupt postal worker who opens unlocked boxes – from copying a key while it is in transit, allowing the third party to spy on all future messages sent between Alice and Bob. In addition, if Bob were careless and allowed someone else to copy ''his'' key, Alice's messages to ''Bob'' would be compromised, but Alice's messages to ''other people'' would remain secret, since the other people would be providing different padlocks for Alice to use.

Another kind of asymmetric key system, called a [[three-pass protocol]], requires neither party to even touch the other party's padlock (or key to get access); Bob and Alice have separate padlocks.
First, Alice puts the secret message in a box, and locks the box using a padlock to which only she has a key. She then sends the box to Bob through regular mail. When Bob receives the box, he adds his own padlock to the box, and sends it back to Alice. When Alice receives the box with the two padlocks, she removes her padlock and sends it back to Bob. When Bob receives the box with only his padlock on it, Bob can then unlock the box with his key and read the message from Alice. &lt;!--

Note that this scheme requires the use of commutative ciphers to allow Alice to remove her encryption, even after Bob's was applied to it, and for Bob's to remain after hers was removed. --&gt;Note that, in this scheme, the order of decryption is NOT the same as the order of encryption – this is only possible if [[commutative cipher]]s are used. A commutative cipher is one in which the order of encryption and decryption is interchangeable, just as the order of multiplication is interchangeable (i.e., &lt;code&gt;A*B*C = A*C*B = C*B*A&lt;/code&gt;). This method is secure for certain choices of commutative ciphers, but insecure for others (e.g., a simple &lt;code&gt;[[XOR]]&lt;/code&gt;). For example, let &lt;code&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; be two encryption functions, and let "&lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;" be the message so that if Alice encrypts it using &lt;code&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; and sends &lt;code&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(M)&lt;/code&gt; to Bob. Bob then again encrypts the message as &lt;code&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(M))&lt;/code&gt; and sends it to Alice. Now, Alice decrypts &lt;code&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(M))&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;. Alice will now get &lt;code&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(M)&lt;/code&gt;, meaning when she sends this again to Bob, he will be able to decrypt the message using &lt;code&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; and get "&lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;". Although none of the keys were ever exchanged, the message "&lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;" may well be a key (e.g., Alice's Public key). This [[three-pass protocol]] is typically used during [[key exchange]].

===Actual algorithms: two linked keys===
Not all asymmetric key algorithms operate in this way. In the most common, Alice and Bob each own ''two'' keys, one for encryption and one for decryption. In a secure asymmetric key encryption scheme, the private key should not be deducible from the public key. This makes possible public key encryption, since an encryption key can be published without compromising the security of messages encrypted with that key.

In other schemes, either key can be used to encrypt the message. When Bob encrypts a message with his private key, only his public key will successfully decrypt it, authenticating Bob's authorship of the message.  In the alternative, when a message is encrypted with the public key, only the private key can decrypt it.  In this arrangement, Alice and Bob can exchange secret messages with no prior secret agreement, each using the other's public key to encrypt, and each using their own private key to decrypt.

===Weaknesses===
Among symmetric key encryption algorithms, only the [[one-time pad]] can be proven to be secure against any adversary – no matter how much computing power is available. However, there is no public key scheme with this property, since all public key schemes are susceptible to a "[[brute-force attack|brute-force key search attack]]". Such attacks are impractical if the amount of computation needed to succeed – termed the "work factor" by [[Claude Shannon]] – is out of reach of all potential attackers. In many cases, the work factor can be increased by simply choosing a longer key. But other algorithms may have much lower work factors, making resistance to a brute-force attack irrelevant. Some special and specific algorithms have been developed to aid in attacking some public key encryption algorithms – both [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] and [[ElGamal encryption]] have known attacks that are much faster than the brute-force approach. These factors have changed dramatically in recent decades, both with the decreasing cost of computing power and with new mathematical discoveries.

Aside from the resistance to attack of a particular key pair, the security of the certification [[hierarchy]] must be considered when deploying public key systems. Some certificate authority – usually a purpose-built program running on a server computer – vouches for the identities assigned to specific private keys by producing a digital certificate. [[Digital certificate|Public key digital certificates]] are typically valid for several years at a time, so the associated private keys must be held securely over that time. When a private key used for certificate creation higher in the PKI server hierarchy is compromised, or accidentally disclosed, then a "[[man-in-the-middle attack]]" is possible, making any subordinate certificate wholly insecure.

Major weaknesses have been found for several formerly promising asymmetric key algorithms. The [[Merkle–Hellman knapsack cryptosystem|'knapsack packing' algorithm]] was found to be insecure after the development of a new attack. Recently, some attacks based on careful measurements of the exact amount of time it takes known hardware to encrypt plain text have been used to simplify the search for likely decryption keys (see "[[side channel attack]]"). Thus, mere use of asymmetric key algorithms does not ensure security. A great deal of active research is currently underway to both discover, and to protect against, new attack algorithms.

Another potential security vulnerability in using asymmetric keys is the possibility of a "man-in-the-middle" attack, in which the communication of public keys is intercepted by a third party (the "man in the middle") and then modified to provide different public keys instead. Encrypted messages and responses must also be intercepted, decrypted, and re-encrypted by the attacker using the correct public keys for different communication segments, in all instances, so as to avoid suspicion. This attack may seem to be difficult to implement in practice, but it is not impossible when using insecure media (e.g., public networks, such as the [[Internet]] or wireless forms of communications) – for example, a malicious staff member at Alice or Bob's Internet Service Provider (ISP) might find it quite easy to carry out. In the earlier postal analogy, Alice would have to have a way to make sure that the lock on the returned packet really belongs to Bob before she removes her lock and sends the packet back. Otherwise, the lock could have been put on the packet by a corrupt postal worker pretending to be Bob, so as to fool Alice.

One approach to prevent such attacks involves the use of a [[certificate authority]], a [[trusted third party]] responsible for verifying the identity of a user of the system. This authority issues a tamper-resistant, non-spoofable [[digital certificate]] for the participants. Such certificates are [[Digital signature|signed]] data blocks stating that this public key belongs to that person, company, or other entity. This approach also has its weaknesses – for example, the certificate authority issuing the certificate must be trusted to have properly checked the identity of the key-holder, must ensure the correctness of the public key when it issues a certificate, must be secure from computer piracy, and must have made arrangements with all participants to check all their certificates before protected communications can begin. [[Web browser]]s, for instance, are supplied with a long list of "self-signed identity certificates" from PKI providers – these are used to check the ''bona fides'' of the certificate authority and then, in a second step, the certificates of potential communicators. An attacker who could subvert any single one of those certificate authorities into issuing a certificate for a bogus public key could then mount a "man-in-the-middle" attack as easily as if the certificate scheme were not used at all.  In an alternate scenario rarely discussed, an attacker who penetrated an authority's servers and obtained its store of certificates and keys (public and private) would be able to spoof, masquerade, decrypt, and forge transactions without limit.

Despite its theoretical and potential problems, this approach is widely used. Examples include [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] and its successor, [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]], which are commonly used to provide security for web browser transactions (for example, to securely send credit card details to an online store).

===Computational cost===
The public key algorithms known thus far are relatively [[algorithmic efficiency|computationally costly]] compared with most symmetric key algorithms of apparently equivalent security. The difference factor is the use of typically quite large keys. This has important implications for their practical use. Most are used in [[hybrid cryptosystem]]s for reasons of efficiency – in such a cryptosystem, a shared secret key ("[[session key]]") is generated by one party, and this much briefer session key is then encrypted by each recipient's public key. Each recipient then uses his own private key to decrypt the session key. Once all parties have obtained the session key, they can use a much faster symmetric algorithm to encrypt and decrypt messages. In many of these schemes, the session key is unique to each message exchange, being pseudo-randomly chosen for each message.

===Associating public keys with identities===
The binding between a public key and its "owner" must be correct, or else the algorithm may function perfectly and yet be entirely insecure in practice. As with most cryptography applications, the [[protocol (cryptography)|protocol]]s used to establish and verify this binding are critically important. Associating a public key with its owner is typically done by protocols implementing a [[public key infrastructure]] – these allow the validity of the association to be formally verified by reference to a [[trusted third party]] in the form of either a hierarchical [[certificate authority]] (e.g., [[X.509]]), a local trust model (e.g., [[simple public key infrastructure|SPKI]]), or a [[web of trust]] scheme, like that originally built into [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] and [[GNU Privacy Guard|GPG]], and still to some extent usable with them. Whatever the cryptographic assurance of the protocols themselves, the association between a public key and its owner is ultimately a matter of subjective judgment on the part of the trusted third party, since the key is a mathematical entity, while the owner – and the connection between owner and key – are not. For this reason, the formalism of a public key infrastructure must provide for explicit statements of the [[policy]] followed when making this judgment. For example, the complex and never fully implemented X.509 standard allows a certificate authority to identify its policy by means of an [[object identifier]], which functions as an index into a catalog of registered policies. Policies may exist for many different purposes, ranging from anonymity to military classifications.

===Relation to real world events===
A public key will be known to a large and, in practice, unknown set of users. All events requiring revocation or replacement of a public key can take a long time to take full effect with all who must be informed (i.e., all those users who possess that key). For this reason, systems that must react to events in real time (e.g., safety-critical systems or national security systems) should not use public key encryption without taking great care. There are four issues of interest:

====Privilege of key revocation====
A malicious (or erroneous) revocation of some (or all) of the keys in the system is likely, or in the second case, certain, to cause a complete failure of the system. If public keys can be revoked individually, this is a possibility. However, there are design approaches that can reduce the practical chance of this occurring. For example, by means of certificates, we can create what is called a "compound principal" – one such principal could be "Alice and Bob have Revoke Authority". Now, only Alice and Bob (in concert) can revoke a key, and neither Alice nor Bob can revoke keys alone. However, revoking a key now requires both Alice ''and'' Bob to be available, and this creates a problem of reliability. In concrete terms, from a security point of view, there is now a "single point of failure" in the public key revocation system. A successful [[Denial of Service]] attack against either Alice or Bob (or both) will block a required revocation. In fact, any partition of authority between Alice and Bob will have this effect, regardless of how it comes about.

Because the principle allowing revocation authority for keys is very powerful, the mechanisms used to control it should involve '''both''' as many participants as possible (to guard against malicious attacks of this type), while at the same time as few as possible (to ensure that a key can be revoked without dangerous delay). Public key certificates that include an expiration date are unsatisfactory in that the expiration date may not correspond with a real-world revocation  but at least such certificates need not all be tracked down system-wide, nor must all users be in constant contact with the system at all times.

====Distribution of a new key====
After a key has been revoked or when a new user is added to a system, a new key must be distributed in some predetermined manner. Assume that Carol's key has been revoked. Until a new key has been distributed, no one will be able to send her messages and messages from her cannot be signed without violating system protocols (i.e., without a valid public key, no one can encrypt messages to her).

One could leave the power to create, certify, and revoke keys in the hands of each user, as the original PGP design did, but this raises problems of user understanding and operation. For security reasons, this approach has considerable difficulties – if nothing else, some users could be forgetful, inattentive, or confused. On the one hand, a message revoking a public key certificate should be spread as fast as possible, while on the other hand, parts of the system might be rendered inoperable before a new key can be installed. The time window can be reduced to zero by always issuing the new key together with the certificate that revokes the old one, but this requires co-location of authority to both revoke keys and generate new keys.

It is most likely a system-wide failure if the (possibly combined) principal that issues new keys fails by issuing keys improperly. This is an instance of a "common mutual exclusion" – a design can make the reliability of a system high, but only at the cost of system availability (and ''vice versa''). {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Spreading the revocation====
Notification of a key certificate revocation must be spread to all those who might potentially hold it, and as rapidly as possible.

There are but two means of spreading information (i.e., a key revocation) in a distributed system: either the information is "pushed" to users from a central point (or points), or else it is "pulled" from a central point (or points) by the end users.

Pushing the information is the simplest solution, in that a message is sent to all participants. However, there is no way of knowing whether all participants will actually ''receive'' the message. If the number of participants is large, and some of their physical or network distances are great, then the probability of complete success (which is, in ideal circumstances, required for system security) will be rather low. In a partly updated state, the system is particularly vulnerable to "denial of service" attacks as security has been breached, and a vulnerability window will continue to exist as long as some users have not "gotten the word". Put another way, pushing certificate revocation messages is neither easy to secure, nor very reliable.

The alternative to pushing is pulling. In the extreme, all certificates contain all the keys needed to verify that the public key of interest (i.e., the one belonging to the user to whom one wishes to send a message, or whose signature is to be checked) is still valid. In this case, at least some use of the system will be blocked if a user cannot reach the verification service (i.e., one of the systems that can establish the current validity of another user's key). Again, such a system design can be made as reliable as one wishes, at the cost of lowering security – the more servers to check for the possibility of a key revocation, the longer the window of vulnerability.

Another trade-off is to use a somewhat less reliable, but more secure, verification service, but to include an expiration date for each of the verification sources. How long this "timeout" should be is a decision that requires a trade-off between availability and security that will have to be decided in advance, at the time of system design.

====Recovery from a leaked key====
Assume that the principal authorized to revoke a key has decided that a certain key must be revoked. In most cases, this happens after the fact – for instance, it becomes known that at some time in the past an event occurred that endangered a private key. Let us denote the time at which it is decided that the compromise occurred as ''T''.

Such a compromise has two implications. First, messages encrypted with the matching public key (now or in the past) can no longer be assumed to be secret. One solution to avoid this problem is to use a protocol that has [[perfect forward secrecy]]. Second, signatures made with the ''no-longer-trusted-to-be-actually-private key'' after time ''T'' can no longer be assumed to be authentic without additional information (i.e., who, where, when, etc.) about the events leading up to the digital signature. These will not always be available, and so all such digital signatures will be less than credible. A solution to reduce the impact of leaking a private key of a signature scheme is to use [[trusted timestamping|timestamps]].

Loss of secrecy and/or authenticity, even for a single user, has system-wide security implications, and a strategy for recovery must thus be established. Such a strategy will determine who has authority to, and under what conditions one must, revoke a public key certificate. One must also decide how to spread the revocation, and ideally, how to deal with all messages signed with the key since time ''T'' (which will rarely be known precisely). Messages sent to that user (which require the proper – now compromised – private key to decrypt) must be considered compromised as well, no matter when they were sent.

A '''salt pig''' is a container used to hold [[salt]], to make it easily accessible to pinch or spoon measure into dishes. They are available in many materials, but are generally [[ceramic]], [[porcelain]], [[earthenware]] or [[clay]].
The earthenware construction of a salt pig can help keep the salt from clumping in [[humid]] kitchens.
According to the blog ''Mundane Essays'', a blog in which writer Muness Alrubaiehis researched the origin of the term "salt pig," the use of "pig" is found in Scots and northern English [[dialect]] meaning an earthenware vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/salt-pigs|title=CooksInfo|website=CooksInfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scaldburn.jpg|thumb|Scalded thumb, two days after a [[Radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] explosion.]]
'''Scalding''' (from the Latin word ''calidus'', meaning hot&lt;ref&gt;[[Mosby's Medical, Nursing &amp; Allied Health Dictionary]], Fourth Edition, Mosby-Year Book Inc., 1994, p. 1395.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a form of [[thermal burn]] resulted from heated [[fluid]]s such as boiling water or steam. Most scalds are considered first or second degree burns, but third degree burns can result, especially with prolonged contact.

==Causes==
Most scalds result from exposure to high-temperature water such as tap water in baths and showers or cooking water [[boiled]] for the preparation of foods or from the spilling of hot drinks, such as [[coffee]].

Scalds can be more severe when steam impinges on the naked skin, because steam can reach higher temperatures than water and transfers [[latent heat]] by condensation. On the other hand when clothes are soaked with hot water the heat transfer is often of a longer duration since the body part can not be removed from the heat source as quickly.  

It is recommended for the temperature of tap water not to exceed 38 — 45 °C to avoid discomfort and scalding.&lt;ref&gt;German and European norm DIN EN 806-2 asks for a maximum of 45 °C in public buildings. The temperature in care homes and childcare is not to exceed 43 °C with a maximum of 38 °C in showers. The German guideline VDI 3818 generally recommends 40 °C for public bathrooms and toilets.&lt;/ref&gt; The technical implementation is complicated by the necessity to keep warm water at a temperature of 55 – 60 °C to inhibit the growth of [[legionella]] bacteria.   
Water hotter than 60 °C can induce scalding injuries within seconds, while it takes approximately 2 minutes to achieve an injury in 50 °C hot water.&lt;ref&gt;FAQ Thermostatic mixing valves - [http://www.esbe.eu/de/en/support/faq/faq-thermostatic-mixing-valves?qid=9Ac_4doDcU-RUEehh-b7FA Why is it important to have a thermostatic mixing valve?], ESBE AB, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scalds are generally more common in children, especially from the accidental spilling of hot liquids.

== Treatment ==
Applying [[first aid]] for scalds is the same as for burns. First, the site of the injury should be removed from the source of heat, to prevent further scalding. If the burn is at least second degree, remove any jewelry or clothing from the site, unless it is already stuck to the skin.  Cool the scald for about 20 minutes with cool or lukewarm (not cold) water, such as water from a tap.&lt;ref name="Burns and scalds"&gt;[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Burns-and-scalds/Pages/Introduction.aspx Burns and scalds - NHS Choices], Treating Burns and Scalds.&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[second-degree burn]]s, [[blister]]s will form, but should never be popped, as it only increases chances of [[infection]]. With [[third-degree burn]]s, it is best to wrap the injury very loosely to keep it clean, and seek expert medical attention.

===Treatments to avoid===
Ice should be avoided, as it can do further damage to area around the injury,&lt;ref name="The Dos and Don'ts of Burns"&gt;[http://health.ninemsn.com/pregnancy/parenthood/694148/the-dos-and-donts-of-burns The Dos and Don'ts of Burns], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117012052/http://health.ninemsn.com/pregnancy/parenthood/694148/the-dos-and-donts-of-burns |date=2013-01-17 }} What's the best way to treat a burn?&lt;/ref&gt; as should butter, [[toothpaste]], and specialized creams.

The carcasses of [[beef]], [[poultry]] and [[pig slaughter|pig]]s are commonly scalded after slaughter to facilitate the removal of feathers and hair.  Methods including immersion in tanks of hot water or spraying with steam.  The scalding may either be hard or soft in which the temperature or duration is varied.  A hard scald of 58&amp;nbsp;°C (136.4&amp;nbsp;°F) for 2.5 minutes will remove the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] of poultry, and this is commonly used for carcasses that will be frozen so that their appearance is white and attractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Microbial ecology of food commodities |chapter=Scalding |page=113 |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-306-48675-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scalding milk ===
{{main|Scalded milk}}
Scalded milk is [[milk]] that has been heated to {{convert|82|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rombauer, Irma and Marion Rombauer Becker. ''The Joy of Cooking''. New York: Signet, 1973. {{ISBN|0-451-07166-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At this temperature, [[bacteria]] are killed, [[enzymatic activity|enzymes]] in the milk are destroyed, and many of the proteins are denatured.

In cooking, milk is typically scalded to increase its temperature, or to change the consistency or other cooking interactions due to the denaturing of proteins.

Recipes that call for scalded milk include [[café au lait]], [[baked milk]], and [[ryazhenka]]. Scalded milk is used in [[yogurt]] to make the [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|proteins unfold]], and to make sure that all organisms that could out-compete the yogurt culture's bacteria are killed.

Milk is both scalded and also cooled in many recipes, such as for bread and other yeast doughs, as [[pasteurization]] does not kill all bacteria, and the wild yeasts that may also be present can alter the texture and flavor. In addition, scalding milk improves the rise due to inhibition of bread rise by certain undenatured milk proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Corriher, Shirley.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33590">'''Second-generation biofuels''', also known as '''advanced biofuels''', are fuels that can be manufactured from various types of non-food [[biomass]]. Biomass in this context means plant materials and animal waste used especially as a source of fuel.

First-generation [[biofuel]]s are made from the [[sugar]]s and [[vegetable oil]]s found in food crops using standard processing technologies. Second-generation biofuels are made from different feedstocks and therefore may require different technology to extract useful energy from them. Second generation feedstocks include [[lignocellulosic biomass]] or woody crops, agricultural residues or waste, as well as dedicated non-food energy crops grown on marginal land unsuitable for crop production.

The term second-generation biofuels is used loosely to describe both the 'advanced' technology used to process feedstocks into biofuel, but also the use of non-food crops, biomass and wastes as feedstocks in 'standard' biofuels processing technologies if suitable. This causes some considerable confusion. Therefore it is important to distinguish between second-generation feedstocks and second-generation biofuel processing technologies.

The development of second-generation biofuels has seen a stimulus since the [[food vs. fuel]] dilemma regarding the risk of diverting farmland or crops for [[Biofuel|biofuels]] production to the detriment of [[food supply]]. The biofuel and [[food price]] debate involves wide-ranging views, and is a long-standing, controversial one in the literature.

== Introduction ==
'''Second-generation biofuel technologies''' have been developed to enable the use of non-food biofuel feedstocks because of concerns to food security caused by the use of food crops for the production of [[Biofuel#First-generation biofuels|first-generation biofuels]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, G. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/international-biofuels-strategy-project-liquid-transport-biofuels-technology-status-report-nnfcc-08-017 "International Biofuels Strategy Project. Liquid Transport Biofuels - Technology Status Report, NNFCC 08-017"], [[National Non-Food Crops Centre]], 2008-04-14. Retrieved on 2011-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The diversion of edible food biomass to the production of biofuels could theoretically result in competition with food and land uses for food crops.

First-generation [[bioethanol]] is produced by [[ethanol fermentation|fermenting]] plant-derived sugars to [[ethanol]], using a similar process to that used in [[beer]] and wine-making (see [[Ethanol fermentation#Uses|Ethanol fermentation]]). This requires the use of food and fodder crops, such as [[sugar cane]], [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], and [[sugar beet]]. The concern is that if these food crops are used for biofuel production that food prices could rise and shortages might be experienced in some countries. Corn, wheat, and sugar beet can also require high [[agricultural]] inputs in the form of [[fertilizers]], which limit the [[greenhouse gas]] reductions that can be achieved. [[Biodiesel]] produced by [[transesterification]] from [[rapeseed oil]], [[palm oil]], or other plant oils is also considered a first-generation biofuel.

The goal of second-generation biofuel processes is to extend the amount of biofuel that can be produced [[sustainably]] by using biomass consisting of the residual [[Non-food crop|non-food]] parts of current crops, such as [[Plant stem|stem]]s, [[Leaf|leaves]] and [[husk]]s that are left behind once the food crop has been extracted, as well as other crops that are not used for food purposes ([[non-food crop]]s), such as [[switchgrass]], [[grass]], [[jatropha]], whole crop [[maize]], [[miscanthus]] and cereals that bear little grain, and also industry waste such as [[woodchips]], [[skin]]s and [[Juice vesicles|pulp]] from fruit pressing, etc.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/b822951c | author = Oliver R. Inderwildi,  [[David King (scientist)|David A. King]] | title = Quo Vadis Biofuels | year = 2009 | journal = Energy &amp; Environmental Science | volume = 2 | pages = 343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem that second-generation biofuel processes are addressing is to extract useful feedstocks from this woody or fibrous biomass, where the useful sugars are locked in by lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose. All plants contain [[lignin]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[cellulose]]. These are complex carbohydrates (molecules based on sugar). [[Lignocellulosic ethanol]] is made by freeing the sugar molecules from cellulose using [[enzymes]], steam heating, or other pre-treatments. These sugars can then be fermented to produce ethanol in the same way as first-generation [[bioethanol]] production. The by-product of this process is lignin. Lignin can be burned as a [[carbon neutral]] fuel to produce heat and power for the processing plant and possibly for surrounding homes and businesses. Thermochemical processes (liquefaction) in hydrothermal media can produce liquid oily products from a wide range of feedstock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Andrew|title=Thermochemical biofuel production in hydrothermal media: A review of sub- and supercritical water technologies|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|date=9 July 2008|volume=1|issue=1|pages=32–65|doi=10.1039/b810100k|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.3674}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has a potential to replace or augment fuels. However, these liquid products fall short of diesel or biodiesel standards. Upgrading liquefaction products through one or many physical or chemical processes may improve properties for use as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=Jerome|last2=Brown|first2=Richard|last3=Rainey|first3=Thomas|title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels|journal=Energies|date=1 July 2015|volume=8|pages=6765–6794|doi=10.3390/en8076765|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/8/7/6765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second-generation technology ==

The following subsections describe the main second-generation routes currently under development.

=== Thermochemical routes ===
Carbon-based materials can be heated at high temperatures in the absence (pyrolysis) or presence of oxygen, air and/or steam (gasification).

These thermochemical processes yield a mixture of gases including hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and other hydrocarbons, and water. Pyrolysis also produces a solid char. The gas can be fermented or chemically synthesised into a range of fuels, including ethanol, synthetic diesel, synthetic gasoline or jet fuel.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-newsletter-issue-19.-advanced-biofuels "NNFCC Newsletter – Issue 19. Advanced Biofuels"], Retrieved on 2011-06-27&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also lower temperature processes in the region of 150–374&amp;nbsp;°C, that produce sugars by decomposing the biomass in water with or without additives.

==== Gasification ====
{{Main article|Gasification}}

Gasification technologies are well established for conventional feedstocks such as coal and crude oil. Second-generation gasification technologies include gasification of forest and agricultural residues, waste wood, energy crops and [[black liquor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/review-of-technologies-for-gasification-of-biomass-and-wastes-nnfcc-09-008 "Review of Technologies for Gasification of Biomass and Wastes, NNFCC 09-008"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318092832/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/review-of-technologies-for-gasification-of-biomass-and-wastes-nnfcc-09-008 |date=2011-03-18 }}, Retrieved on 2011-06-24&lt;/ref&gt; Output is normally [[syngas]] for further synthesis to e.g. [[Fischer-Tropsch]] products including diesel fuel, [[biomethanol]], [[BioDME]] ([[dimethyl ether]]), [[gasoline]] via catalytic conversion of dimethyl ether, or [[biomethane]] ([[synthetic natural gas]]). Syngas can also be used in heat production and for generation of mechanical and electrical power via gas motors or [[gas turbine]]s.

==== Pyrolysis ====
{{Main article|Pyrolysis}}
Pyrolysis is a well established technique for [[decomposition]] of [[organic material]] at elevated temperatures in the absence of [[oxygen]]. In second-generation biofuels applications forest and agricultural residues, wood waste and energy crops can be used as feedstock to produce e.g. [[bio-oil]] for fuel oil applications. Bio-oil typically requires significant additional treatment to render it suitable as a refinery feedstock to replace crude oil.

==== Torrefaction ====
{{Main article|Torrefaction}}
Torrefaction is a form of pyrolysis at temperatures typically ranging between 200–320&amp;nbsp;°C. Feedstocks and output are the same as for [[#Pyrolysis|pyrolysis]].

==== Hydrothermal liquefaction ====
{{Main|Hydrothermal liquefaction}}
Hydrothermal liquefaction is a process similar to pyrolysis that can process wet materials. The process is typically at moderate temperatures up to 400 °C and higher than atmospheric pressures. The capability to handle a wide range of materials make hydrothermal liquefaction viable for producing fuel and chemical production feedstock.

=== Biochemical routes ===
{{main article|Biochemistry}}
Chemical and biological processes that are currently used in other applications are being adapted for second-generation biofuels. Biochemical processes typically employ pre-treatment to accelerate the hydrolysis process, which separates out the lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose. Once these ingredients are separated, the cellulose fractions can be fermented into alcohols.&lt;ref name="news"/&gt;

Feedstocks are energy crops, agricultural and forest residues, food industry and municipal biowaste and other biomass containing [[sugar]]s. Products include [[alcohol]]s (such as [[ethanol]] and [[butanol]]) and other [[hydrocarbons]] for transportation use.

== Types of biofuel ==
The following second-generation biofuels are under development, although most or all of these biofuels are synthesized from intermediary products such as syngas using methods that are identical in processes involving conventional feedstocks, first-generation and second-generation biofuels. The distinguishing feature is the technology involved in producing the intermediary product, rather than the ultimate off-take.

A process producing liquid fuels from gas (normally syngas) is called a [[Gas to liquids|gas-to-liquid]] (GtL) process.&lt;ref name="Httpwwwrscorgdelivery_ArticleLinkingDisplayHTMLArticleforfreecfmJournalCodeEEYearManuscriptIDbcIssAdvance_Article"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayHTMLArticleforfree.cfm?JournalCode=EE&amp;Year=2009&amp;ManuscriptID=b822951c&amp;Iss=Advance_Article|title=Quo vadis biofuels?|year=2009|author1=Oliver R. Inderwildi |author2= David A. King |doi= 10.1039/B822951C |journal=Energy Environ. Sci.|volume=2|pages=343–346}}&lt;/ref&gt; When biomass is the source of the gas production the process is also referred to as [[biomass-to-liquid]]s (BTL).

=== From syngas using catalysis ===
* [[Biomethanol]] can be used in methanol motors or blended with petrol up to 10–20% without any infrastructure changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refuel.eu/biofuels/biomethanol/|title=Refuel.com biomethanol|website=refuel.eu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713065140/http://www.refuel.eu/biofuels/biomethanol/|archivedate=2006-07-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[BioDME]] can be produced from Biomethanol using catalytic dehydration or it can be produced directly from syngas using direct DME synthesis. DME can be used in the [[compression ignition engine]].
* Bio-derived [[gasoline]] can be produced from DME via high-pressure catalytic [[condensation reaction]]. Bio-derived gasoline is chemically indistinguishable from petroleum-derived gasoline and thus can be blended into the gasoline pool.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/04/f22/demonstration_market_transformation_knight_3417.pdf Knight, R. "Green Gasoline from Wood Using Carbona Gasification and Topsoe TIGAS Processes." DOE Biotechnology Office (BETO) 2015 Project Peer Review (24 Mar 2015)].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biohydrogen]] can be used in [[fuel cells]] to produce electricity.
* Mixed Alcohols (i.e., mixture of mostly [[ethanol]], [[propanol]], and [[butanol]], with some [[pentanol]], [[hexanol (disambiguation)|hexanol]], [[heptanol (disambiguation)|heptanol]], and [[octanol]]). Mixed alcohols are produced from [[syngas]] with several classes of catalysts.  Some have employed catalysts similar to those used for methanol.&lt;ref&gt;Lu, Yongwu, Fei Yu, Jin Hu, and Jian Liu. "Catalytic conversion of syngas to mixed alcohols over Zn-Mn promoted Cu-Fe based catalyst." Applied Catalysis A: General (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Molybdenum sulfide catalysts were discovered at Dow Chemical&lt;ref name="Quarderer, George J. 1989"&gt;Quarderer, George J., Rex R. Stevens, Gene A. Cochran, and Craig B. Murchison. "Preparation of ethanol and higher alcohols from lower carbon number alcohols." U.S. Patent 4,825,013, issued April 25, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and have received considerable attention.&lt;ref&gt;Subramani, Velu; Gangwal, Santosh K.; "A Review of Recent Literature to Search for an Efficient Catalytic Process for the Conversion of Syngas to Ethanol", Energy and Fuels, 31 January 2008, web publication.&lt;/ref&gt;  Addition of cobalt sulfide to the catalyst formulation was shown to enhance performance.&lt;ref name="Quarderer, George J. 1989"/&gt;  Molybdenum sulfide catalysts have been well studied&lt;ref&gt;Zaman, Sharif, and Kevin J. Smith. "A Review of Molybdenum Catalysts for Synthesis Gas Conversion to Alcohols: Catalysts, Mechanisms and Kinetics." Catalysis Reviews 54, no. 1 (2012): 41-132.&lt;/ref&gt; but have yet to find widespread use.  These catalysts have been a focus of efforts at the U.S. Department of Energy's Biomass Program in the Thermochemical Platform.&lt;ref&gt;News Release NR-2108, "Dow and NREL Partner to Convert Biomass to Ethanol and Other Chemical Building Blocks", July 16, 2008, downloaded from http://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2008/617.html on 19 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Noble metal catalysts have also been shown to produce mixed alcohols.&lt;ref&gt;Glezakou, Vassiliki-Alexandra, John E. Jaffe, Roger Rousseau, Donghai Mei, Shawn M. Kathmann, Karl O. Albrecht, Michel J. Gray, and Mark A. Gerber. "The Role of Ir in Ternary Rh-Based Catalysts for Syngas Conversion to C 2+ Oxygenates." Topics in Catalysis (2012): 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most R&amp;D in this area is concentrated in producing mostly ethanol. However, some fuels are marketed as mixed alcohols (see [[Ecalene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerenergy.com/|title=PowerEnergy.com|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130408080544/http://www.powerenergy.com/|archivedate=8 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and E4 Envirolene)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standardalcohol.com/biofuel.htm|title=standard-alcohol|work=standard-alcohol|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mixed alcohols are superior to pure methanol or ethanol, in that the higher alcohols have higher energy content. Also, when blending, the higher alcohols increase compatibility of gasoline and ethanol, which increases water tolerance and decreases evaporative emissions.  In addition, higher alcohols have also lower heat of vaporization than ethanol, which is important for cold starts. (For another method for producing mixed alcohols from biomass see [[bioconversion of biomass to mixed alcohol fuels]])
* [[methane|Biomethane]] (or [[Bio-SNG]]) via the [[Sabatier reaction]]

=== From syngas using Fischer–Tropsch ===
{{main article|Fischer–Tropsch process}}
The [[Fischer–Tropsch process|Fischer–Tropsch (FT) process]] is a gas-to-liquid (GtL) process.&lt;ref name="Httpwwwrscorgdelivery_ArticleLinkingDisplayHTMLArticleforfreecfmJournalCodeEEYearManuscriptIDbcIssAdvance_Article" /&gt; When biomass is the source of the gas production the process is also referred to as biomass-to-liquids (BTL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senternovem.nl/mmfiles/Status_perspectives_biofuels_EU_2005_tcm24-152475.pdf Status And Perspectives of Biomass-To-Liquid Fuels in the European Union] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031063550/http://www.senternovem.nl/mmfiles/Status_perspectives_biofuels_EU_2005_tcm24-152475.pdf |date=2007-10-31 }} (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

A disadvantage of this process is the high energy investment for the FT synthesis and consequently, the process is not yet economic.

* FT diesel can be mixed with [[fossil diesel]] at any percentage without need for infrastructure change and moreover, synthetic [[kerosene]] can be produced&lt;ref name="King" /&gt;

=== Biocatalysis ===
* [[Biohydrogen]] might be accomplished with some organisms that produce hydrogen directly under certain conditions. Biohydrogen can be used in [[fuel cells]] to produce electricity.
* [[Butanol fuel|Butanol]] and [[Isobutanol]] via recombinant pathways expressed in hosts such as [[E. coli]] and [[yeast]], butanol and isobutanol may be significant products of [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] using [[glucose]] as a [[carbon]] and energy source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2008080124|title=Butanol Production by Metabolically Engineered Yeast|website=wipo.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[2,5-Dimethylfuran|DMF]] (2,5-Dimethylfuran). Recent advances in producing DMF from [[fructose]] and [[glucose]] using [[Catalysis|catalytic]] biomass-to-liquid process have increased its attractiveness.

=== Other processes ===
* [[Thermal depolymerization|HTU]] (Hydro Thermal Upgrading) diesel is produced from wet biomass. It can be mixed with fossil diesel in any percentage without need for infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refuel.eu/biofuels/htu-diesel/|title=Refuel.com HTU diesel|website=refuel.eu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713065128/http://www.refuel.eu/biofuels/htu-diesel/|archivedate=2006-07-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wood diesel]].  A new biofuel was developed by the [[University of Georgia]] from [[woodchips]]. The oil is extracted and then added to unmodified diesel engines. Either new plants are used or planted to replace the old plants. The charcoal byproduct is put back into the soil as a fertilizer. According to the director Tom Adams since carbon is put back into the soil, this biofuel can actually be carbon negative not just carbon neutral. Carbon negative decreases carbon dioxide in the air reversing the greenhouse effect not just reducing it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

== Second Generation Feedstocks ==

To qualify as a second generation feedstock, a source must not be suitable for human consumption. Second-generation biofuel feedstocks include specifically grown inedible energy crops, cultivated inedible oils, agricultural and municipal wastes, waste oils, and algae.&lt;ref name="nnfcc1"&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/pathways-to-uk-biofuels-a-guide-to-existing-and-future-options-for-transport-nnfcc-10-035 "Pathways to UK Biofuels: A Guide to Existing and Future Options for Transport, NNFCC 10-035"], Retrieved on 2011-06-27&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, cereal and sugar crops are also used as feedstocks to second-generation processing technologies. Land use, existing biomass industries and relevant conversion technologies must be considered when evaluating suitability of developing biomass as feedstock for energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosinkova|first1=Jana|last2=Doshi|first2=Amar|last3=Maire|first3=Juliette|last4=Ristovski|first4=Zoran|last5=Brown|first5=Richard|last6=Rainey|first6=Thomas|title=Measuring the regional availability of biomass for biofuels and the potential for microalgae|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=September 2015|volume=49|pages=1271–1285|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.04.084|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032115003548#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy crops===
{{Main article|Energy crop}}

Plants are made from [[lignin]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[cellulose]]; second-generation technology uses one, two or all of these components. Common lignocellulosic energy crops include [[wheat]] straw, ''[[Arundo donax]]'', ''[[Miscanthus]]'' spp., short rotation coppice [[Populus|poplar]] and [[willow]]. However, each offers different opportunities and no one crop can be considered 'best' or 'worst'.&lt;ref name="nnfcc3"&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]].

===Municipal solid waste===
{{Main article|Waste to energy}}

Municipal Solid Waste comprises a very large range of materials, and total waste arisings are increasing. In the UK, recycling initiatives decrease the proportion of waste going straight for disposal, and the level of recycling is increasing each year. However, there remains significant opportunities to convert this waste to fuel via gasification or pyrolysis.&lt;ref name="nnfcc2"&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]].

===Green waste===
{{Main article|Green waste}}

Green waste such as forest residues or [[garden]] or [[park]] waste&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winwaste.com/CaseStudy3.aspx|title=Green waste removal case study|website=winwaste.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718064555/http://www.winwaste.com/CaseStudy3.aspx|archivedate=2011-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be used to produce [[biofuel]] via different routes. Examples include [[Biogas]] captured from [[biodegradable waste|biodegradable green waste]], and [[gasification]] or [[hydrolysis]] to [[syngas]] for further processing to [[biofuel]]s via [[catalytic]] processes.

===Black liquor===
{{Main article|Black liquor|Tall oil}}

Black liquor, the spent cooking liquor from the [[kraft process]] that contains concentrated [[lignin]] and [[hemicellulose]], may be [[gasification|gasified]] with very high [[Energy conversion efficiency|conversion efficiency]] and [[greenhouse gas]] reduction potential&lt;ref&gt;[http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/media/WTW_Report_010307.pdf Well-to-Wheels analysis of future automotive fuels and powertrains in the European context] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304231419/http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/media/WTW_Report_010307.pdf |date=2011-03-04 }} EUCAR / Concawe /[[Joint Research Centre|JRC]] Well-to-Wheels Report Version 2c, March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; to produce [[syngas]] for further [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] to e.g. [[biomethanol]] or [[BioDME]].

== Greenhouse gas emissions ==

Lignocellulosic biofuels reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 60–90% when compared with fossil petroleum (Börjesson.P. et al. 2013. Dagens och framtidens hållbara biodrivmedel), which is on par with the better of current biofuels of the first-generation, where typical best values currently is 60–80%. In 2010, average savings of biofuels used within EU was 60% (Hamelinck.C. et al. 2013 Renewable energy progress and biofuels sustainability, Report for the European Commission). In 2013, 70% of the biofuels used in Sweden reduced emissions with 66% or higher. (Energimyndigheten 2014. Hållbara biodrivmedel och flytande biobränslen 2013).

== Commercial development ==
{{Outdated section|date=April 2017}}
An operating lignocellulosic ethanol production plant is located in Canada, run by [[Iogen Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iogen.ca/ IOGEN&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration-scale plant produces around 700,000 litres of bioethanol each year. A commercial plant is under construction. Many further lignocellulosic ethanol plants have been proposed in North America and around the world.

The [[Sweden|Swedish]] specialty [[cellulose]] mill [[Domsjö Fabriker]] in [[Örnsköldsvik]], [[Sweden]] develops a [[biorefinery]] using [[Chemrec|Chemrec's]] [[black liquor]] [[gasification]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/67&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - State aid: Commission approves Swedish €55 million aid for "Domsjö" R&amp;amp;D project|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When commissioned in 2015 the biorefinery will produce 140,000 tons of [[biomethanol]] or 100,000 tons of [[BioDME]] per year, replacing 2% of Sweden's imports of diesel fuel for transportation purposes. In May 2012 it was revealed that Domsjö pulled out of the project, effectively killing the effort.

In the UK, companies like [[INEOS]] Bio and [[British Airways]] are developing advanced biofuel refineries, which are due to be built by 2013 and 2014 respectively. Under favourable economic conditions and strong improvements in policy support, [[NNFCC]] projections suggest advanced biofuels could meet up to 4.3 per cent of the UK's transport fuel by 2020 and save 3.2 million tonnes of {{CO2}} each year, equivalent to taking nearly a million cars off the road.&lt;ref name="nnfcc3"/&gt;

Helsinki, Finland, 1 February 2012 – UPM is to invest in a biorefinery producing biofuels from crude tall oil in Lappeenranta, Finland. The industrial scale investment is the first of its kind globally. The biorefinery will produce annually approximately 100,000 tonnes of advanced second-generation biodiesel for transport. Construction of the biorefinery will begin in the summer of 2012 at UPM’s Kaukas mill site and be completed in 2014.

Calgary, Alberta, 30 April 2012 – Iogen Energy Corporation has agreed to a new plan with its joint owners Royal Dutch Shell and Iogen Corporation to refocus its strategy and activities. Shell continues to explore multiple pathways to find a commercial solution for the production of advanced biofuels on an industrial scale, but the company will NOT pursue the project it has had under development to build a larger scale cellulosic ethanol facility in southern Manitoba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iogen.ca/news_events/press_releases/2012_04_30_refocus.pdf | title=Iogen Energy to refocus its strategy and activities | date=30 April 2012 | location=Calgary, Alberta | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522171132/http://www.iogen.ca/news_events/press_releases/2012_04_30_refocus.pdf | archivedate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Drop-in" biofuels ==
So-called "drop-in" biofuels can be defined as "liquid bio-hydrocarbons that are functionally equivalent to petroleum fuels and are fully compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Karatzos |first1=Sergios |last2=McMillan |first2=James D. |last3=Saddler |first3=Jack N. |date=July 2014 |title=The Potential and Challenges of Drop-in Biofuels |url=http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20171112021600/http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-date=November 12, 2017 |dead-url=no |publisher=IEA Bioenergy Task 39 |page=2 |isbn=978-1-910154-07-6 |id=Report T39-T1 |access-date=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable interest in developing advanced biofuels that can be readily integrated in the existing petroleum fuel infrastructure – i.e. "dropped-in" – particularly by sectors such as aviation, where there are no real alternatives to sustainably produced biofuels for low carbon emitting fuel sources. Drop-in biofuels by definition should be fully fungible and compatible with the large existing "petroleum-based" infrastructure.

According to a July 2014 report published by the IEA Bioenergy Task 39, entitled "The Potential and Challenges of Drop-in Biofuels", there are several ways to produce drop-in biofuels that are functionally equivalent to petroleum-derived transportation fuel blendstocks. These are discussed within three major sections of the full report and include: 

* oleochemical processes, such as the hydroprocessing of lipid feedstocks obtained from oilseed crops, algae or tallow; 
* thermochemical processes, such as the thermochemical conversion of biomass to fluid intermediates (gas or oil) followed by catalytic upgrading and hydroprocessing to hydrocarbon fuels; and 
* biochemical processes, such as the biological conversion of biomass (sugars, starches or lignocellulose-derived feedstocks) to longer chain alcohols and hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Karatzos |first1=Sergios |last2=McMillan |first2=James D. |last3=Saddler |first3=Jack N. |date=July 2014 |title=The Potential and Challenges of Drop-in Biofuels |url=http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20171112021600/http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-date=November 12, 2017 |dead-url=no |publisher=IEA Bioenergy Task 39 |page=3 |isbn=978-1-910154-07-6 |id=Report T39-T1 |access-date=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth category is also briefly described that includes "hybrid" thermochemical/biochemical technologies suchas fermentation of synthesis gas and catalytic reforming of sugars/carbohydrates.

The report concludes by stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tremendous entrepreneurial activity to develop and commercialize drop-in biofuels from aquatic and terrestrial feedstocks has taken place over the past several years. However, despite these efforts, drop-in biofuels represent only a small percentage (around 2%) of global biofuel markets. ... Due to the increased processing and resource requirements (e.g., hydrogen and catalysts) needed to make drop-in biofuels as compared to conventional biofuels, large scale production of cost-competitive drop-in biofuels is not expected to occur in the near to midterm. Rather, dedicated policies to promote development and commercialization of these fuels will be needed before they become significant contributors to global biofuels production. Currently, no policies (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies etc.) differentiate new, more fungible and infrastructure ready drop-in type biofuels from less infrastructure compatible oxygenated biofuels. ...  Thus, while tremendous technical progress has been made in developing and improving the various routes to drop-in fuels, supportive policies directed specifically towards the further development of drop-in biofuels are likely to be needed to ensure their future commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Karatzos |first1=Sergios |last2=McMillan |first2=James D. |last3=Saddler |first3=Jack N. |date=July 2014 |title=The Potential and Challenges of Drop-in Biofuels |url=http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20171112021600/http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-date=November 12, 2017 |dead-url=no |publisher=IEA Bioenergy Task 39 |pages=177, 182 |isbn=978-1-910154-07-6 |id=Report T39-T1 |access-date=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7399">In [[information theory]] and telecommunication engineering, the  '''signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio''' ('''SINR'''&lt;ref name="Haenggi2009"/&gt;) (also known as the '''signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio''' ('''SNIR''')&lt;ref name="franceschetti2007random"/&gt;)  is a quantity used to give theoretical upper bounds on [[channel capacity]] (or the rate of information transfer) in wireless communication systems such as networks. Analogous to the SNR used often in wired communications systems, the SINR is defined as the power of a certain signal of interest divided by the sum of the [[Interference (communication)|interference]] power (from all the other interfering signals) and the power of some background noise. If the power of noise term is zero, then the SINR reduces to the [[signal-to-interference ratio]] (SIR). Conversely, zero interference reduces the SINR to the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR), which is used less often when developing [[mathematical models]] of wireless networks such as [[cellular networks]].&lt;ref name="andrews2010primer"&gt;J. G. Andrews, R. K. Ganti, M. Haenggi, N. Jindal, and S. Weber. A primer on spatial modeling and analysis in wireless networks. ''Communications Magazine, IEEE'', 48(11):156--163, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity and randomness of certain types of wireless networks and signal propagation has motivated the use of [[Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks|stochastic geometry models]] in order to model the SINR, particularly for cellular or mobile phone networks.&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"&gt;M. Haenggi. ''Stochastic geometry for wireless networks''. Cambridge University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
SINR is commonly used in [[wireless communication]] as a way to measure the quality of wireless connections. Typically, the energy of a signal fades with distance, which is referred to as a [[path loss]] in wireless networks. Conversely, in wired networks the existence of a wired path between the sender or transmitter and the receiver determines the correct reception of data. In a wireless network ones has to take other factors into account (e.g. the background noise, interfering strength of other simultaneous transmission). The concept of SINR attempts to create a representation of this aspect.

==Mathematical definition==
The definition of SINR is usually defined for a particular receiver (or user). In particular, for a receiver located at some point ''x'' in space (usually, on the plane), then its corresponding SINR given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SINR}(x) {{=}} \frac{P}{I+N} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the power of the incoming signal of interest, ''I'' is the interference power of the other (interfering) signals in the network, and ''N'' is some noise term, which may be a constant or random. Like other ratios in electronic engineering and related fields, the SINR is often expressed in [[decibel]]s or dB.

==Propagation model==
To develop a mathematical model for estimating the SINR, a suitable [[mathematical model]] is needed to represent the propagation of the incoming signal and the interfering signals. A common model approach is to assume the [[Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks#Model fundamentals#Propagation model|propagation model]] consists of a random component and non-random (or deterministic) component.&lt;ref name="BB1"&gt;F. Baccelli and B. Blaszczyszyn. ''Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks, Volume I --- Theory'', volume 3, No 3--4 of ''Foundations and Trends in Networking''. NoW Publishers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BB2"&gt;F. Baccelli and B. Blaszczyszyn. ''Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks, Volume II --- Applications'', volume 4, No 1--2 of ''Foundations and Trends in Networking''. NoW Publishers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deterministic component seeks to capture how a signal decays or attenuates as it travels a medium such as air, which is done by introducing a path-loss or attenuation function. A common choice for the path-loss function is a simple power-law. For example, if a signal travels from point ''x'' to point ''y'',  then it decays by a factor given by the path-loss function

:&lt;math&gt;  \ell(|x-y|)=  |x-y|^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,

where the path-loss exponent '' α&gt;2'', and ''|x-y|'' denotes the [[Euclidean distance|distance]] between point ''y'' of the user and the signal source at point ''x''. Although this model suffers from a singularity (when ''x=y''), its simple nature results in it often being used due to the relatively tractable models it gives.&lt;ref name="andrews2010primer"/&gt; Exponential functions are sometimes used to model fast decaying signals.&lt;ref name="Haenggi2009"&gt;M. Haenggi, J. Andrews, F. Baccelli, O. Dousse, and M. Franceschetti. Stochastic geometry and random graphs for the analysis and design of wireless networks. ''IEEE JSAC'', 27(7):1029--1046, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The random component of the model entails representing [[multipath fading]] of the signal, which is caused by  signals colliding with and reflecting off various obstacles such as buildings. This is incorporated into the model by introducing a [[random variable]] with some [[probability distribution]]. The probability distribution is chosen depending on the type of fading model and include [[Rayleigh distribution|Rayleigh]], [[Rician distribution|Rician]], [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal shadow]] (or shadowing), and [[Nakagami distribution|Nakagami]].

==SINR model==
The propagation model leads to a model for the SINR.&lt;ref name="franceschetti2007random"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt; Consider a collection of 'n' base stations located at points ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the plane or 3D space. Then for a user located at, say ''x=0'', then the SINR for a signal coming from base station, say, ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', is given by



:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SINR}(x_i) {{=}} \frac{\frac{F_i}{\ell(|x_i|)}}{\sum_{j\neq i} [\frac{F_j}{\ell(|x_j|)}] +N} &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are fading [[random variables]] of some distribution. Under the simple power-law path-loss model becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SINR}(x_i) {{=}} \frac{\frac{F_i}{|x_i|^{\alpha}}}{\sum_{j\neq i} \frac{F_j}{|x_j|^{\alpha}} +N} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Stochastic geometry models==
In wireless networks, the factors that contribute to the SINR are often random (or appear random) including the signal propagation and the positioning of network transmitters and receivers. Consequently, in recent years this has motivated research in developing tractable [[Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks|stochastic geometry models]] in order to estimate the SINR in wireless networks. The related field of [[continuum percolation theory]] has also been used to derive  bounds on the SINR in wireless networks.&lt;ref name="franceschetti2007random"&gt;M. Franceschetti and R. Meester. ''Random networks for communication: from statistical physics to information systems'', volume 24. Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meester1996continuum"&gt;R. Meester. ''Continuum percolation'', volume 119.

&lt;!-- the German article deals rather with the SWIFT-Code --&gt;
The '''Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication''' ('''SWIFT''') provides a network that enables [[financial institution]]s worldwide to send and receive information about [[Financial transaction|financial transactions]] in a secure, standardized and reliable environment. SWIFT also sells [[software]] and services to financial institutions, much of it for use on the SWIFTNet Network, and [[ISO 9362]]. Business Identifier Codes (BICs, previously Bank Identifier Codes) are popularly known as "SWIFT codes".

The majority of international interbank messages use the SWIFT network. {{As of|2015|}}, SWIFT linked more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories, who were exchanging an average of over 15 million messages per day (compared to an average of 2.4 million daily messages in 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swift Company Information |url=http://www.swift.com/about_swift/company_information/index.page?lang=en|publisher=[[SWIFT]]|date=9 March 2010 |accessdate= 7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SWIFT transports financial messages in a highly secure way but does not hold accounts for its members and does not perform any form of [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] or [[Settlement (finance)|settlement]].

SWIFT does not facilitate funds transfer: rather, it sends [[payment order]]s, which must be settled by [[correspondent account]]s that the institutions have with each other. Each financial institution, to exchange banking transactions, must have a banking relationship by either being a bank or affiliating itself with one (or more) so as to enjoy those particular business features.

SWIFT is a [[cooperative society]] under [[Belgium|Belgian]] law owned by its member financial institutions with offices around the world. SWIFT headquarters, designed by [[Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura]] are in [[La Hulpe]], Belgium, near [[Brussels]]. The chairman of SWIFT is Yawar Shah,&lt;ref name="swiftboard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Board members|url=https://www.swift.com/about-us/organisation-governance/board-members#topic-tabs-menu|website=SWIFT|accessdate=May 4, 2016|date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally from [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yawar  Shah - 1996 - 40 Under Forty - Crain's New York Business|url=http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/40under40/profiles/1996/yawar-shah|accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[chief executive officer|CEO]] is Gottfried Leibbrandt, originally from the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="swiftmgmt"&gt;{{cite web|title=SWIFT Management|url=https://www.swift.com/about-us/organisation-governance/swift-management#topic-tabs-menu|website=SWIFT|accessdate=May 4, 2016|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SWIFT hosts an annual conference, called [[Sibos (conference)|Sibos]], specifically aimed at the [[financial services]] industry.

== History ==
SWIFT was founded in [[Brussels]] in 1973 under the leadership of its inaugural CEO, [[Carl Reuterskiöld]] (1973–1989), and was supported by 239 banks in fifteen countries. It started to establish [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication#Standards|common standards]] for financial transactions and a shared data processing system and worldwide communications network designed by [[Logica]] and developed by The Burroughs Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.logica.com/we-are-logica/about-logica/history-and-key-milestones/| title=Logica history}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental [[Policies and Procedures|operating procedures]], rules for [[legal liability|liability]], etc., were established in 1975 and the first message was sent in 1977. SWIFT's first United States operating center was inaugurated by Governor [[John N. Dalton]] of Virginia in 1979.&lt;ref name=swiftobituary&gt;{{cite web |title=Carl Reuterskiöld |url=http://www.swift.com/about_swift/press_room/swift_news_archive/home_page_stories_archive_2006/61159/carl_reuterski_ld.page? |publisher=SWIFT|accessdate=7 September 2012|date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standards ==
SWIFT has become the industry standard for [[syntax]] in financial messages. Messages formatted to SWIFT standards can be read by, and processed by, many well-known financial processing systems, whether or not the message traveled over the SWIFT network. SWIFT cooperates with international organizations for defining standards for message format and content. SWIFT is also ''[[Registration authority]]'' (RA) for the following [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards:
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Operations centers ==
The SWIFT secure messaging network is run from three [[data center]]s, one in the [[United States]], one in the [[Netherlands]] and one in a secret location known only by a restricted number of employees for security reasons. These centers share information in [[Real-time computing|near real-time]]. In case of a failure in one of the data centers, the other is able to handle the traffic of the complete network. SWIFT uses [[submarine communications cable]]s to transmit its data.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cyberspace in Deep Water: Protecting Undersea Communication Cables By Creating an International Public-Private Partnership |date=March 23, 2010 |first=Michael |last=Sechrist |url=https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/PAE_final_draft_-_043010.pdf |publisher=[[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]] |quote=For example, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), which describes itself as “the global provider of secure financial messaging services,” uses undersea fiber-optic communications cables to transmit financial data between 208 countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SWIFT opened a third data center in [[Switzerland]], which started operating in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SWIFT: SIBOS issues|url=http://www.swift.com/sibos2008/sibos_2008_learn_discuss_debate/sibos_issues/Sibos_Issues_20080916.pdf|publisher=[[SWIFT]]|date=16 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107043453/http://www.swift.com/sibos2008/sibos_2008_learn_discuss_debate/sibos_issues/Sibos_Issues_20080916.pdf|archivedate=7 November 2015|df=dmy-all}} p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, data from European SWIFT members are no longer mirrored to the U.S. data center. The distributed architecture partitions messaging into two messaging zones: European and Trans-Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Distributed architecture |url=http://www.swift.com/products_services/industry_initiatives/distributed_architecture |publisher=[[SWIFT]]|date=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; European zone messages are stored in the Netherlands and in a part of the Switzerland operating center; Trans-Atlantic zone messages are stored in the United States and in a part of the Switzerland operating center that is segregated from the European zone messages. Countries outside of Europe were by default allocated to the Trans-Atlantic zone but could choose to have their messages stored in the European zone.

== SWIFTNet network==
SWIFT moved to its current IP network infrastructure, known as SWIFTNet, from 2001 to 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SWIFT History |url=http://www.swift.com/about_swift/company_information/swift_history.page?lang=en|publisher=[[SWIFT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing a total replacement of the previous [[X.25]] infrastructure. The process involved the development of new protocols that facilitate efficient messaging, using existing and new message standards. The adopted technology chosen to develop the protocols was [[XML]], where it now provides a wrapper around all messages legacy or contemporary. The communication protocols can be broken down into:

{{col-begin}}
{{col-3}}
'''InterAct'''
*SWIFTNet InterAct Realtime
*SWIFTNet InterAct Store and Forward
{{col-3}}
'''FileAct'''
* SWIFTNet FileAct Realtime
* SWIFTNet FileAct Store and Forward
{{col-3}}
'''Browse'''
* SWIFTNet Browse
{{col-end}}

=== Architecture ===
SWIFT provides a centralized store-and-forward mechanism, with some transaction management. For bank A to send a message to bank B with a copy or authorization with institution C, it formats the message according to standard and securely sends it to SWIFT. SWIFT guarantees its secure and reliable delivery to B after the appropriate action by C. SWIFT guarantees are based primarily on high redundancy of hardware, software, and people.

=== SWIFTNet Phase 2 ===
During 2007 and 2008, the entire SWIFT Network migrated its infrastructure to a new protocol called SWIFTNet Phase 2. The main difference between Phase 2 and the former arrangement is that Phase 2 requires banks connecting to the network to use a [[Relationship Management Application (RMA)]] instead of the former [[bilateral key exchange]] (BKE) system. According to SWIFT's public information database on the subject, RMA software should eventually prove more secure and easier to keep up-to-date; however, converting to the RMA system meant that thousands of banks around the world had to update their international payments systems to comply with the new standards. RMA completely replaced BKE on 1 January 2009.

== Products and interfaces ==
SWIFT means several things in the financial world: 
# a [[Secure transmission|secure network]] for transmitting messages between financial institutions;
# a set of syntax standards for financial messages (for transmission over SWIFTNet or any other network)
# a set of connection software and services allowing financial institutions to transmit messages over SWIFT network.

Under 3 above, SWIFT provides [[turnkey|turn-key]] solutions for members, consisting of [[Client (computing)|linkage clients]] to facilitate connectivity to the SWIFT network and [[Graphical user interface|CBTs or "computer based terminals"]] which members use to manage the delivery and receipt of their messages. Some of the more well-known interfaces and CBTs provided to their members are:

* SWIFTNet Link (SNL) software which is installed on the SWIFT customer's site and opens a connection to SWIFTNet. Other applications can only communicate with SWIFTNet through the SNL.
* Alliance Gateway (SAG) software with interfaces (e.g., RAHA = Remote Access Host Adapter), allowing other software products to use the SNL to connect to SWIFTNet
* Alliance WebStation (SAB) desktop interface for SWIFT Alliance Gateway with several usage options:
:# administrative access to the SAG
:# direct connection SWIFTNet by the SAG, to administrate SWIFT Certificates
:# so-called Browse connection to SWIFTNet (also by SAG) to use additional services, for example Target2
* Alliance Access (SAA) and Alliance Messaging Hub (AMH) are the main messaging software applications by SWIFT, which allow message creation for [[ISO 15022|FIN messages]], routing and monitoring for FIN and [[ISO 20022|MX messages]]. The main interfaces are FTA (files transfer automated, not FTP) and MQSA, a [[WebSphere MQ]] interface.
* The Alliance Workstation (SAW) is the desktop software for administration, monitoring and FIN message creation. Since Alliance Access is not yet capable of creating MX messages, Alliance Messenger (SAM) has to be used for this purpose.
* Alliance Web Platform (SWP) as new thin-client desktop interface provided as an alternative to existing Alliance WebStation, Alliance Workstation (soon){{when|date=April 2018}} and Alliance Messenger.
* Alliance Integrator built on [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]'s [[Java Caps]] which enables customer's back office applications to connect to Alliance Access or Alliance Entry.
* Alliance Lite2 is a secure and reliable, cloud-based way to connect to the SWIFT network which is a light version of Alliance Access specifically targeting customers with low volume of traffic.

; Services 
There are four key areas that SWIFT services fall under in the financial marketplace: [[Security (finance)|Securities]], [[Treasury]] &amp; [[Derivative (finance)|Derivatives]], [[Trade Services]] and [[Payments &amp; Cash Management]].

=== SWIFTREF ===
Swift Ref, the global payment reference data utility, is SWIFT’s unique reference data service. Swift Ref sources data direct from data originators, including central banks, code issuers and banks making it easy for issuers and originators to maintain data regularly and thoroughly. SWIFTRef constantly validates and cross-checks data across the different data sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.surecomp.com/value-added.html | title=SWIFTREF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SWIFTNet Mail ===
SWIFT offers a secure person-to-person messaging service, SWIFTNet Mail, which went live on 16 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swift.com/about_swift/press_room/press_releases/press_releases_archive/mail_simple_secure_and_reliable_email.page |title=SWIFTNet Mail now available}}&lt;/ref&gt; SWIFT clients can configure their existing email infrastructure to pass email messages through the highly secure and reliable SWIFTNet network instead of the open Internet. SWIFTNet Mail is intended for the secure transfer of sensitive business documents, such as invoices, contracts and signatories, and is designed to replace existing telex and courier services, as well as the transmission of security-sensitive data over the open Internet. Seven financial institutions, including [[HSBC]], [[First National Bank (South Africa)|FirstRand Bank]], [[Clearstream]], [[DnB NOR]], [[Nedbank]], and [[Standard Bank|Standard Bank of South Africa]], as well as SWIFT piloted the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://www.swift.com/index.cfm?item_id=61132 |title=SWIFTNet Mail pilot phase underway |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201094800/http://www.swift.com/index.cfm?item_id=61132 |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df=dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. government involvement ==

=== Terrorist Finance Tracking Program ===
{{Main article|Terrorist Finance Tracking Program}}

A series of articles published on 23 June 2006 in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' revealed a program, named the [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]], which the [[US Treasury Department]], [[CIA|Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]], and other [[United States government]]al agencies initiated after the [[11 September attacks]] to gain access to the SWIFT transaction database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |title=Belgian PM: Data Transfer Broke Rules |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/28/AR2006092800585.html |work=The Washington Post|date=28 September 2005 |first=Constant |last=Brand |access-date=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of these articles, SWIFT quickly came under pressure for compromising the [[data privacy]] of its customers by allowing governments to gain access to sensitive personal information.  In September 2006, the Belgian government declared that these SWIFT dealings with American governmental authorities were a breach of Belgian and [[European Union law|European]] [[privacy law]]s.

In response, and to satisfy members' concerns about privacy, SWIFT began a process of improving its architecture by implementing a distributed architecture with a two-zone model for storing messages (see [[#Operations centers|Operations centers]]).

Concurrently, the [[European Union]] negotiated an agreement with the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] to permit the transfer of intra-EU SWIFT transaction information to the United States under certain circumstances.  Because of concerns about its potential contents, the [[European Parliament]] adopted a position statement in September 2009, demanding to see the full text of the agreement and asking that it be fully compliant with EU privacy legislation, with oversight mechanisms emplaced to ensure that all data requests were handled appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=European Parliament resolution of 17 September 2009 on the SWIFT Agreement |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P7-TA-2009-0016&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=B7-2009-0038 |publisher=[[European Parliament]] |date=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interim agreement was signed without European Parliamentary approval by the [[European Council]] on 30 November 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=European Parliament to vote on interim agreement at February session |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/019-67614-018-01-04-902-20100119IPR67613-18-01-2010-2010-false/default_en.htm |publisher=[[European Parliament]] |date=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the day before the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]]—which would have prohibited such an agreement from being signed under the terms of the [[Codecision procedure]]—formally came into effect.  While the interim agreement was scheduled to come into effect on 1 January 2010, the text of the agreement was classified as "EU Restricted" until translations could be provided in all EU languages and published on 25 January 2010.

On 11 February 2010, the European Parliament decided to reject the interim agreement between the EU and the USA by 378 to 196 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2010/02/parliament-rejects-bank-transfer-data-deal/67144.aspx |newspaper=European Voice |title=Parliament rejects bank transfer data deal |date=11 February 2010 |first=Constant |last=Brand }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8510471.stm |title=Euro MPs block bank data deal with US |work=[[BBC News]] |date=11 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One week earlier, the parliament's civil liberties committee had already rejected the deal, citing legal reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/european-parliament-rejects-swift-deal-for-sharing-bank-data-with-us/a-5239595 |newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle|DW]] |title=European parliament rejects SWIFT deal for sharing bank data with US |agency=Reuters |date=11 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, it was reported that two mechanisms of data protection had failed: [[EUROPOL]] released a report complaining that the USA's requests for information had been too vague (making it impossible to make judgments on validity)&lt;ref name="2011spiegel"&gt;{{cite news |title=Brussels Eyes a Halt to SWIFT Data Agreement |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,751262,00.html |newspaper=Der Spiegel |date=16 March 2011 |first1=Christoph |last1=Schult}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the guaranteed right for European citizens to know whether their information had been accessed by USA authorities had not been put into practice.&lt;ref name="2011spiegel"/&gt;

=== Sanctions against Iran ===
In January 2012, the advocacy group [[United Against Nuclear Iran]] (UANI) implemented a campaign calling on SWIFT to end all relations with Iran's banking system, including the [[Central Bank of Iran]].  UANI asserted that Iran's membership in SWIFT violated U.S. and EU financial sanctions against Iran as well as SWIFT's own corporate rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran Praises Nuclear Talks with Team from U.N. |first=Rick |last=Gladstone |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/01/world/middleeast/iran-calls-un-nuclear-teams-visit-constructive.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, in February 2012, the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|U.S. Senate Banking Committee]] unanimously approved sanctions against SWIFT aimed at pressuring the Belgian financial telecommunications network to terminate its ties with blacklisted Iranian banks. Expelling Iranian banks from SWIFT would potentially deny Iran access to billions of dollars in revenue and spending using SWIFT but not from using [[Informal value transfer system|IVTS]]. [[Mark Wallace]], president of UANI, praised the Senate Banking Committee.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate Panel Approves Potentially Toughest Penalty Yet Against Iran's Wallet |first=Rick |last=Gladstone |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/world/middleeast/tough-iran-penalty-clears-senate-banking-panel.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=3 February 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially SWIFT denied it was acting illegally,&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; but now says "it is working with U.S. and European governments to address their concerns that its financial services are being used by Iran to avoid sanctions and conduct illicit business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Banking Hub Adds to Pressure on Iran |first=Jay |last=Solomon |author2=&amp; Adam Entous |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203889904577201330206741436 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=4 February 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeted banks would be—amongst others—[[Saderat Bank of Iran]], [[Bank Mellat]], [[Post Bank of Iran]] and [[Sepah Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Banking's SWIFT says ready to block Iran transactions |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/17/iran-sanctions-swift-idUSL5E8DH31020120217 |publisher=Reuters |date=17 February 2012 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 March 2012, following agreement two days earlier between all 27 member states of the [[Council of the European Union]] and the Council's subsequent ruling, SWIFT disconnected all Iranian banks from its international network that had been identified as institutions in breach of current EU sanctions and warned that even more Iranian financial institutions could be disconnected from the network.

In February 2016, most Iranian banks reconnected to the network following lift of sanctions on [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-banks-swift-idUSKCN0VQ1FD |first=Andrew | last=Torchia |publisher=Reuters |title=Iranian banks reconnected to SWIFT network after four-year hiatus |date=17 February 2016 |access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. control over transactions within the EU ===
On 26 February 2012 the [[Denmark|Danish]] newspaper ''[[Berlingske]]'' reported that US authorities have sufficient control over SWIFT to seize money being transferred between two European Union (EU) countries (Denmark and Germany), since they succeeded in seizing around US$26,000 that was being transferred from a Danish businessman to a [[Germany|German]] bank. The transaction was automatically routed through the US, possibly because of the USD currency used in the transaction, which is how the United States was able to seize the funds. The money was a payment for a batch of [[Cuban cigars]] previously imported to Germany by a German supplier. As justification for the seizure, the [[U.S. Treasury]] stated that the Danish businessman had violated the [[United States embargo against Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dansk politimand fanget i amerikansk terrornet|first1=Simon |last1=Bendtsen |first2=Peter Suppli |last2= Benson|url= http://www.b.dk/nationalt/dansk-politimand-fanget-i-amerikansk-terrornet |newspaper=[[Berlingske]] |date=26 February 2012 |accessdate=26 February 2012 |trans-title= Danish policeman caught in American terror net |language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://cphpost.dk/news14/international-news14/us-snubs-out-legal-cigar-transaction.html |title= US snubs out legal cigar transaction |work=[[The Copenhagen Post]] |date=2012-02-27 |accessdate= 2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monitoring by the NSA ===
''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported in September 2013 that the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) widely monitors banking transactions via SWIFT, as well as credit card transactions.&lt;ref name=speigel&gt;{{cite web |title='Follow the Money': NSA Spies on International Payments|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/spiegel-exclusive-nsa-spies-on-international-bank-transactions-a-922276.html |work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=18 September 2013 |date=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA intercepted and retained data from the SWIFT network used by thousands of banks to securely send transaction information. SWIFT was named as a "target", according to documents leaked by [[Edward Snowden]]. The documents revealed that the NSA spied on SWIFT using a variety of methods, including reading "SWIFT printer traffic from numerous banks".&lt;ref name=speigel/&gt;  In April 2017, a group known as the [[Shadow Brokers]] released files allegedly from the NSA which indicate that the agency monitored financial transactions made through SWIFT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baldwin |first=Clare |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-swift-idUSKBN17G1HC |title=Hackers release files indicating NSA monitored global bank transfers |date=15 April 2017 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lawler |first=Richard |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/14/shadow-brokers-release-also-suggest-nsa-spied-on-bank-transactio/ |title=Shadow Brokers release also suggests NSA spied on bank transactions |work=Engadget |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in sanctions==
As mentioned above SWIFT had disconnected all Iranian banks from its international network as a [[Sanctions against Iran|sanction against Iran]]. However, as of 2016 Iranian banks which are no longer on international sanctions lists, were reconnected to SWIFT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-banks-swift/iranian-banks-reconnected-to-swift-network-after-four-year-hiatus-idUSKCN0VQ1FD|title=Iranian banks reconnected to SWIFT network after four-year hiatus|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|website=www.reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though in theory this enables movement of money from and to these Iranian banks, foreign banks remain wary of doing business with the country. Due to primary sanctions, transactions of U.S. banks with Iran, or transactions in U.S. dollars with Iran, remain prohibited. 

Similarly, in August 2014 the UK planned to press the EU to block Russian use of SWIFT as a sanction due to [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian military intervention in Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= U.K. Wants EU to Block Russia From SWIFT Banking Network |first=Robert |last=Hutton |author2= Ian Wishart|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-29/u-k-wants-eu-to-block-russia-from-swift-banking-network.html|newspaper=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=29 August 2014 |accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, SWIFT refused to do so. In their official statement they said, "SWIFT regrets the pressure, as well as the surrounding media speculation, both of which risk undermining the systemic character of the services that SWIFT provides its customers around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swift.com/about_swift/shownews?param_dcr=news.data/en/swift_com/2014/PR_swift_sanctions_statement.xml|title=SWIFT Sanctions Statement|work=swift.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SPFS]], a Russia-based SWIFT equivalent, was created by the Central Bank of Russia as a backup measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Turak |first1=Natasha |title=Russia's central bank governor touts Moscow alternative to SWIFT transfer system as protection from US sanctions |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/23/russias-central-bank-governor-touts-moscow-alternative-to-swift-transfer-system-as-protection-from-us-sanctions.html |accessdate=4 October 2018 |work=CNBC |date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018 the European Union foreign policy head, [[Federica Mogherini]], proposed the development of a new "special purpose financial vehicle" intended to bypass the U.S. controlled Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication payments system - commonly known as '''SWIFT'''. The seven founding members of this new system are to be Iran, the European Commission, Germany, France, the U.K., Russia and China - but not the United States.

The United States, having withdrawn from the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|JCPOA]] - better known as "the Iran Nuclear Deal" -  has decreed severe sanctions against any nation trading with Iran. The new payments system is designed to remove certain banking transactions with Iran from the purview of U.S. authorities, and as such, to escape U.S. sanctions against nations trading with Iran.  The apparent goal is to encourage Iran to continue to adhere to the terms of the '''JCPOA''', which forbids the testing, development and manufacture of nuclear weapons, even though no claims of breach have been made by any party of the JCPOA except the United States.  

In time, it could be used more generally to evade other U.S. sanctions, such as those against the German-Russian pipeline project known as [[Nordstream 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-09-25/europe-unveils-special-purpose-vehicle-bypass-swift-jeopardizing-dollars-reserve |title=Europe Unveils "Special Purpose Vehicle" To Bypass SWIFT, Jeopardizing Dollar's Reserve Status |publisher=Zero Hedge |date= |accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

SWIFT has also rejected calls to boycott [[Israel]]i banks from its network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/business/.premium-1.619514 International banking giant refuses to cut off Israel, despite boycott calls]. [[Haaretz]]. 7 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|2016 Bangladesh Bank heist}}
In 2016 an $81 million theft from the [[Bangladesh]] central bank via its account at the New York [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|Federal Reserve Bank]] was traced to [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] penetration of SWIFT's [[#Products and interfaces|Alliance Access]] software, according to a New York ''Times'' report. It was not the first such attempt, the society acknowledged, and the security of the transfer system was undergoing new examination accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Corkery, Michael, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/business/dealbook/hackers-81-million-sneak-attack-on-world-banking.html "Hackers’ $81 Million Sneak Attack on World Banking"], New York ''Times'', April 30, 2016. Retrieved 2016-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the reports of the theft from the Bangladesh central bank, a second, apparently related, attack was reported to have occurred on a commercial bank in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Second Attack Reported NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/business/dealbook/swift-global-bank-network-attack.html | title=Once Again, Thieves Enter Swift Financial Network and Steal | work=New York Times | date=12 May 2016 | accessdate=13 May 2016 | author=Corkery, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReutersSpecialReport"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bergin|first1=Tom|last2=Layne|first2=Nathan|title=Special Report: Cyber thieves exploit banks' faith in SWIFT transfer network|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-heist-swift-specialreport-idUSKCN0YB0DD|accessdate=24 May 2016|agency=Reuters|date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both attacks involved [[malware]] written to both issue unauthorized SWIFT messages and to conceal that the messages had been sent. After the malware sent the SWIFT messages that stole the funds, it deleted the database record of the transfers then took further steps to prevent confirmation messages from revealing the theft. In the Bangladeshi case, the confirmation messages would have appeared on a paper report; the malware altered the paper reports when they were sent to the printer. In the second case, the bank used a PDF report; the malware altered the PDF viewer to hide the transfers.&lt;ref name="Second Attack Reported NYT" /&gt;

In May 2016, [[Banco del Austro]] (BDA) in Ecuador sued [[Wells Fargo]] after Wells Fargo honored $12 million in fund transfer requests that had been placed by thieves.&lt;ref name="ReutersSpecialReport" /&gt; In this case, the thieves sent SWIFT messages that resembled recently canceled transfer requests from BDA, with slightly altered amounts; the reports do not detail how the thieves gained access to send the SWIFT messages. BDA asserts that Wells Fargo should have detected the suspicious SWIFT messages, which were placed outside of normal BDA working hours and were of an unusual size. Wells Fargo claims that BDA is responsible for the loss, as the thieves gained access to the legitimate SWIFT credentials of a BDA employee and sent fully authenticated SWIFT messages.&lt;ref name="ReutersSpecialReport" /&gt;

In the first half of 2016, an anonymous Ukrainian bank, with the episode being investigated by [[ISACA]], and others—even "dozens" that are not being made public—were variously reported to have been "compromised" through the SWIFT network and to have lost money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.scmagazineuk.com/swift-robbers-swoop-on-ukrainian-bank/article/506140/ | title =SWIFT robbers swoop on Ukrainian bank | last =Metzger | first =Max | date =June 28, 2016 | access-date =June 29, 2016 |publisher=[[SC Magazine]] UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Song Jian''' ({{zh|c=宋健|w='''Sung Chien'''}}; born 29 December 1931) is a Chinese missile scientist and politician. He was deputy chief designer of China's [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] and one of the country's leading scientists in the post-[[Cultural Revolution]] era.  Following the Chinese government's announcement in 1979 to advocate for one child per family, he became a leading advocate for rapid implementation and broad coverage of China's [[one-child policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tien |first1=H.Y. |title=China's Strategic Demographic Initiative |date=1991 |publisher=Praeger |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scharping |first1=Thomas |title=Birth control in China 1949–2000: Population policy and demographic development. |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=253}}{{sfnp|Hvistendahl|2010|p=1460}} He served in high-ranking political positions including [[Ministry of Aerospace Industry|Vice Minister of Aerospace Industry]], Director of the [[State Science and Technology Commission]] (1985–1998), vice-premier-level [[State councillor (China)|State Councillor]] (1986–1998), President of the [[Chinese Academy of Engineering]], and [[Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]].

==Early life and education==
Song Jian was born on 29 December 1931 in [[Rongcheng, Shandong|Rongcheng]], [[Shandong]] Province.{{sfnp|Lu|2006|p=41}}&lt;ref name=cas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casad.cas.cn/aca/371/xxjskxb-200906-t20090624_1807751.html |title=Song Jian |publisher=[[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] |accessdate=17 January 2018 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, he enlisted in the Communist Party's [[Eighth Route Army]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]] at the age of 14.{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2008|p=128}}

After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he studied at [[Harbin Industrial University]] and [[Beijing Foreign Language Institute]],&lt;ref name=cppcc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cppcc.gov.cn/2011/09/28/ARTI1317197245750109.shtml |title=Song Jian |publisher=[[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] |accessdate=17 January 2018 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being sent to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1953 on the recommendation of [[Liu Shaoqi]], Vice Chairman of China.{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2008|p=128}} Described as a "brilliant" student, he studied [[cybernetics]] and military science under the theorist [[A. A. Feldbaum]]. He earned an associate Ph.D. degree from [[Moscow State University]]{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2008|p=128}} and a Ph.D. from [[Bauman Moscow State Technical University]].&lt;ref name=cas/&gt; He published seven papers in Russian on [[control theory]], which won praise from Soviet and American scientists.{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2008|p=128}}

==Career==
After the [[Sino-Soviet split]] in 1960, Song returned to China and was put in charge of control systems at the Fifth Academy (later known as the [[Seventh Ministry of Machine Building]] or Missile Ministry) of the [[Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of National Defense]]. He was one of China's top experts on [[missile guidance]] systems. [[Qian Xuesen]], the "father of China's space and missile defence programs", highly praised Song's ability and declared that Song was China's foremost control theorist, surpassing Qian himself. Qian personally chose Song to co-author the revised edition of his ''Engineering Cybernetics'', regarded as a bible of Chinese military science.{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2008|p=129}}

At the beginning of the [[Cultural Revolution]], Song's home was ransacked by the [[Red Guards]] before Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] included him in the list of top 50 scientists considered indispensable to national defence and afforded special protection. Song was sent to the [[Jiuquan Missile Base]] in the desert where he could focus on his studies and research, before returning to Beijing in 1969. His work on [[anti-ballistic missile]]s attracted Zhou's attention.{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2008|p=130}}

In the late 1970s, Song applied his expertise in cybernetics to the problem of population control and became a proponent of China's [[one-child policy]].{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=259}} At the same time, he continued to work in the missile and aerospace programs and rapidly ascended the political hierarchy. He was appointed deputy chief designer of China's [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] in February 1980 and [[Ministry of Aerospace Industry|Vice Minister of Aerospace Industry]] in 1982.{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=260}} In 1985 he became Director of the powerful [[State Science and Technology Commission]], and the next year he additionally became a [[State councillor (China)|State Councillor]], a vice-premier-level position. He held both positions until 1998,&lt;ref name=cppcc/&gt;{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=260}} when he was appointed President of the [[Chinese Academy of Engineering]] and [[Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC).&lt;ref name=cppcc/&gt;

Song was an alternate members of the [[12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]], and a full member of the [[13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|13th]], [[14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|14th]], and [[15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|15th]] central committees.&lt;ref name=cppcc/&gt;

==One-child policy==
After the end of the Cultural Revolution, China's new leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] reduced military spending and urged scientists to focus their energy on solving the country's urgent economic problems, one of which was China's huge and fast growing, yet impoverished population.{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=258}} In 1978, as China made its initial announcement in support of one child families, Song attended the Seventh World Congress of the [[International Federation of Automatic Control]] in [[Helsinki]], Finland, where he encountered the cybernetic-based population control theory associated with the [[Club of Rome]]. He saw the theory as a precise and scientific approach to the population control problem, which seemed superior to the Marxist perspectives that had long predominated in China.{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=259}}

Based on assumptions of future trends, Song and his group performed calculations that determined the "ideal" population for China in the next 100 years was 650 to 700 million, about two-thirds of its then-population of 1 billion. In order to achieve this long-term environmentally sustainable population, he showed that the "optimal" trajectory was to reduce fertility rapidly to one child per couple by 1985 and maintain that level for 20 to 40 years, and then slowly raise it to the replacement level (2.1 children per woman).{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=266}}

Following the Chinese central government's decision to advocate for one-child families in 1979, Song and his associates entered the picture, actively supporting and promoting the one child ideal through conference discussions in 1980 in Chengdu.  They presented their work to members of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]],{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=269}} and through the country's top scientists, came to the attention of, and won support of, China's top leaders for rapid implementation and broad coverage of one-child limits. Song's work was endorsed by Vice Premiers [[Chen Muhua]]{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=270}} and [[Wang Zhen (general)|Wang Zhen]],{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=271}} who recommended it to [[Chen Yun]], the second most influential official after [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Shocked by Song's population projections, the highest of which projected China's population to reach 4 billion by 2080 if women continued to have three births per woman, China's leaders were convinced that rapid adoption of a near universal [[one-child policy]] was the country's only option.{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=271}} Although some leaders, including [[Zhao Ziyang]] and [[Hu Yaobang]], expressed doubts about its feasibility, Song spoke forcefully at a top-secret high-level meeting convened in April 1980, winning many over to his recommendation of universal one-child limits.{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=272}} In September, the third session of the Fifth [[National People's Congress]] approved the policy.{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=273}}

Although it is widely agreed that Song's population projections influenced the speed and scope of implementation of one-child limits, several leading scholars have refuted Greenhalgh's thesis that Song "hijacked the population policymaking process" {{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=269-270}} and that he should be considered both the inventor and central architect of the one-child policy, a thesis that has often been regurgitated without much critical reflection.{{sfnp|Hvistendahl|2010|p=1460}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zubrin |first1=Robert |title=Radical Environmentalists, Criminal Pseudo-Scientists, and the Fatal Cult of Antihumanism |journal=The New Atlantis |date=2012 |volume=2646 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fong |first1=Mei |title=One child: The story of China's most radical experiment. |date=2016 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Liang Zhongtang, who participated in the critical policy discussions in Chengdu in 1980 and emerged as the foremost internal critic of one-child limits, confirms that Greenhalgh put too much emphasis on Song and his group.{{sfnp|Hvistendahl|2010|p=1460}}.  Wang et al. agree, concluding that "the idea of the one-child policy came from leaders within the Party, not from scientists who offered evidence to support it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Feng |last2=Cai |first2=Yong |last3=Gu |first3=Baochang |title=Population, policy, and politics: How will history judge China's one-child policy? |journal=Population and Development Review |date=2013 |volume=38 |issue=Suppl. 1 |pages=cite p.119–120 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2013.00555.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Goodkind suggests that Song and his colleagues were "more like expert witnesses for a government already determined to prosecute one-child restrictions, taking advantage of the opportunity to become players in a vast and expanding government bureaucracy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodkind |first1=Daniel |title=If Science Had Come First: A Billion Person Fable for the Ages (A Reply to Comments) |journal=Demography |date=2018 |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=cite p.762–763}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, upon learning of Song's work in February 1980, correspondence from [[Wang Zhen (general)|Wang Zhen]], [[Chen Muhua]], and other top officials{{sfnp|Greenhalgh|2005|p=269-270}} suggests that they were already highly sympathetic to Song's position.  

It is also important to note that the universal one-child limits advocated by Song lasted only five years.  In the mid 1980s, China began to permit exemptions for rural parents whose first child was a daughter (an exemption allowed due to the unpopularity of the universal one-child rule), which, along with other exemptions, resulted in a "1.5-child" policy that lasted for nearly 30 years.  Thus, the policy in place since the mid 1980s that has been commonly referred to as "the one-child policy" was actually a less restrictive policy, the very sort that China might have adopted in 1980 even without the population projections and cybernetic models of Song and his colleagues.  

==Other programs==
As the director of the [[State Science and Technology Commission]], Song was in charge of China's science and technology policies. He oversaw the {{ill|Spark Program|zh|星火计划}}, which aims to popularize scientific knowledge and technology to benefit common people, the {{ill|Torch Program|zh|火炬计划}}, which encourages scientists to commercialize their scientific discoveries, and the [[863 Program]], which aims to stimulate the development of high-tech research in China. He also launched the [[Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project]] to determine a more accurate chronology of the earliest dynasties in Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpcchina.chinadaily.com.cn/2011-01/25/content_13916846.htm |title=Song Jian: a leading scientist |work=China Daily |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
Song Jian is an academician of both the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] and the [[Chinese Academy of Engineering]]. He is a foreign member of the [[US National Academy of Engineering]], the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences]]. He is also a member of [[Euro-Asian Academy of Sciences]] and the [[International Academy of Astronautics]].{{sfnp|Lu|2006|p=41}}

The '''Specialist Engineering Contractors' Group''' (SEC Group) is a [[United Kingdom]] [[construction]] industry organisation, currently representing six specialist [[engineering]] membership associations. Collectively, these associations comprise over 60,000 companies with a total workforce of over 300,000 individuals.

The SEC Group reflects the combined views of these organisations, notably in the [[Strategic Forum for Construction]], where it is one of two bodies representing specialist contractors (the other is the [[National Specialist Contractors Council]]).

It is particularly active in the areas of achieving: more cost effective procurement; fair and prompt payment; and the early involvement of specialist contractors in construction projects, to ensure more effective delivery.

'''Temporal multithreading''' is one of the two main forms of [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreading]] that can be implemented on computer processor hardware, the other being [[simultaneous multithreading]].  The distinguishing difference between the two forms is the maximum number of concurrent [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] that can execute in any given [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] stage in a given [[Instruction cycle|cycle]].  In temporal multithreading the number is one, while in simultaneous multithreading the number is greater than one. Some authors use the term '''super-threading''' synonymously.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/cpu/hyperthreading.ars/3 Superthreading with a multithreaded processor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
There are many possible variations of temporal multithreading, but most can be classified into two sub-forms:

;[[Granularity (parallel computing)|Coarse-grained]]: The main processor pipeline contains only one thread at a time.  The processor must effectively perform a rapid [[context switch]] before executing a different thread.  This fast context switch is sometimes referred to as a ''thread switch''.  There may or may not be additional penalty cycles when switching.

:There are many possible variations of coarse-grained temporal multithreading, mainly concerning the algorithm that determines when thread switching occurs.  This algorithm may be based on one or more of many different factors, including cycle counts, [[Cache miss#Cache miss|cache misses]], and [[Unbounded nondeterminism#Fairness|fairness]].

;[[Granularity (parallel computing)|Fine-grained]] (or interleaved):
The main processor pipeline may contain multiple threads, with context switches effectively occurring between pipe stages (e.g., in the [[barrel processor]]). This form of multithreading can be more expensive than the coarse-grained forms because execution resources that span multiple pipe stages may have to deal with multiple threads.  Also contributing to cost is the fact that this design cannot be optimized around the concept of a "background" thread &amp;mdash; any of the concurrent threads implemented by the hardware might require its [[State (computer science)|state]] to be read or written on any cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Operating System Concepts|last = Silberschatz|first = Abraham|publisher = Wiley, 9th Edition|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1118063330|location = |pages = 283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to simultaneous multithreading==
In any of its forms, temporal multithreading is similar in many ways to simultaneous multithreading.  As in the simultaneous process, the [[computer hardware|hardware]] must store a complete set of states per concurrent thread implemented. The hardware must also preserve the illusion that a given thread has the processor resources to itself.  Fairness algorithms must be included in both types of multithreading situations to prevent one thread from dominating processor time and/or resources.

Temporal multithreading has an advantage over simultaneous multithreading in that it causes lower processor heat output; however, it allows only one thread to be executed at a time.

==See also==
*[[Simultaneous multithreading]], another implementation of hardware multithreading
*[[Thread (computer science)]], the fundamental [[software entity]] scheduled by the [[operating system]] [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] to execute on a [[CPU]] or processor (core)
*[[Symmetric multiprocessing]], where the system (or [[Logical partition (virtual computing platform)|partition]] of a larger computer hardware platform) contains more than one CPU or processor (core) and where the operating system kernel is not limited to which of the available CPUs (cores) a given thread can be scheduled to execute on.

'''Tests of Engineering Aptitude, Mathematics, and Science''' ('''TEAMS''') is an annual competition originally organized by the [[Junior Engineering Technical Society]] (JETS). TEAMS is an annual theme-based competition for students in grades 9-12, aimed at giving them the opportunity to discover engineering and how they can make a difference in the world.

==History==
The TEAMS competition was created in 1975 at the [[University of Illinois]] for the state of [[Illinois]]. In 1978, JETS expanded TEAMS to become a national competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jets.org/whoweare/history.cfm |accessdate=March 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905101212/http://www.jets.org/whoweare/history.cfm |archivedate=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the TEAMS test changed format into a format very similar to the one used today. Since 2008, the TEAMS competitions have had a theme.

The 2010 theme for the TEAMS competition delved in the problems engineers face while providing access to clean water. It was named for [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Samuel Taylor Coleridge's]] famous quote, "Water, water, everywhere, / Nor any drop to drink."

==Format==
This competition is divided in two parts. The first part, lasting an hour and a half, has 80 multiple choice questions. Each group of ten questions is related to a specific problem relating to the overall theme. The second part consists of eight open-ended tasks that are aimed at encouraging teamwork to develop the best answer. This competition is taken part by each participating school in a regional competition; the scores at that date determine the standings in the regional, state, and national level. There are six school divisions, one home division, one group division and two levels (9th/10th grade level &amp; 11th/12th grade level).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jets.org/TEAMS/about/index.cfm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407151621/http://www.jets.org/TEAMS/about/index.cfm |date=April 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each team consists of eight high school students. A school may submit multiple teams. Thousands of teams participate in this competition each year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1427">'''Third-party billing''' is a form of billing where an intermediary handles the invoicing and payment between a purchaser and a vendor.

==Telecommunications==
In telecommunications, it can refer to an [[operator-assisted]] [[telephone]] call, usually in conjunction with the assistance of a live or automated telephone operator. 

It can also refer to a service that allows consumers to make purchases through authorized merchants, service providers and telecommunications companies, and have charges placed directly on their local phone bill, as an alternate payment option.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/understanding-your-telephone-bill/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Third party billing serves nearly 12 million households in the United States, and handles hundreds of millions of authorized transactions for consumers and businesses each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsgclearing.com/question_about_your_bill/consumer_faqs/&lt;/ref&gt;  Several businesses, including [[Fortune 500]] companies, choose to have their services included on their phone bills to reduce administrative needs and costs. 

==Transportation==
In transportation, third party billing is the transference of transportation charges to a party other than the shipper or [[consignee]].

==Cramming==
[[Cramming (fraud)|Cramming]] happens when third party billing occurs on phones without consent of the person being billed.

'''Timeline of United States discoveries''' encompasses the breakthroughs of human thought and knowledge of new scientific findings, phenomena, places, things, and what was previously unknown to exist. From a historical stand point, the timeline below of United States discoveries dates from the 18th century to the 21st century, which have been achieved by discoverers who are either native-born or naturalized [[citizens of the United States]].

With an emphasis of [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]] in the fields of [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]], and [[archaeology]], United States citizens acclaimed in their professions have contributed much.  For example, the "[[Bone Wars]]," beginning in 1877 and ending in 1892, was an intense period of rivalry between two American paleontologists, [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], who initiated several expeditions throughout [[North America]] in the pursuit of discovering, identifying, and finding new species of [[Fossil|dinosaur fossils]]. In total, their large efforts resulted in when 142 species of dinosaurs being discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dinosaur Wars|publisher=PBS Educational Foundation|url=http://www.wgbhinternational.org/index.php?sid=wylwnn8nvvtp5p2qx64a06xzixj85qdr&amp;lang=english&amp;page=in_production&amp;dle_pp=0&amp;dle_od=asc&amp;pr_act=details&amp;pid=805}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the founding of the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) in 1958, a vision and continued commitment by the United States of finding extraterrestrial and astronomical discoveries has helped the world to better understand our [[solar system]] and [[universe]]. As one example, in 2008, the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' lander]] discovered the presence of frozen water on the planet [[Mars]] of which scientists such as [[Peter Smith (scientist)|Peter H. Smith]] of the [[University of Arizona]] [[Lunar and Planetary Laboratory]] (LPL) had suspected before the mission confirmed its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Phoenix Mars Lander Confirms Frozen Water|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080620.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1747 [[Charge conservation]]'''
* In physics, charge conservation is the principle that [[electric charge]] can neither be created nor destroyed. The quantity of electric charge, the amount of [[positive charge]] minus the amount of [[negative charge]] in the universe, is always [[Conserved quantity|conserved]]. As part of his groundbreaking work in electricity, [[Benjamin Franklin]] around the year 1747 discovered the principle of charge conservation when he came to the conclusion that the two states of electricity, positive and negative, the charge is never created or destroyed but instead transferable from one place to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Happy 300th Birthday Ben Franklin!|publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|url=http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/newsletters/emcs/fall06/franklin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1796 [[Johnston Atoll]]'''
* Johnston Atoll, a [[territory of the United States]], a [[Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument]], and a part of the wider [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]], is a 50-square-mile (130 km2) atoll in the [[North Pacific Ocean]] about 750 miles (1,400 kilometers) west of the U.S. state of [[Hawaii]]. There are four islands located on the coral reef platform, two natural islands, Johnston Island and Sand Island, which have been expanded by coral dredging, as well as North Island (Akau) and East Island (Hikina), an additional two artificial islands formed by coral dredging. The sovereignty of Johnston Atoll was disputed and claimed by the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] beginning in 1858 until Hawaii itself was eventually annexed by the United States as the [[Hawaii Territory]] in 1898. Johnston Atoll is now administered and managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], an agency of the [[United States Department of Interior]]. In 1796, Johnston Atoll was discovered accidentally by U.S. Captain Joseph Pierpoint when his ship, the American brig ''Sally'', ran aground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnston Island National Wildlife Refuge|publisher=United States Fish and Wildlife Service|url=http://www.fws.gov/refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=12515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1798 [[Tabuaeran]]'''
* Tabuaeran, also known as Fanning Island or Fanning Atoll (both Gilbertese and English names are recognized) is one of the [[Line Islands]] located in the central [[Pacific Ocean]]. With a population of approximately 2,500, much of the island's economy relies upon the cruise industry. Formerly under British rule, Tabuaeran now is a part of the [[Republic of Kiribati]]. Tabuaeran was discovered on June 11, 1798 by U.S. Captain [[Edmund Fanning]], at 3 a.m., while on a voyage to [[China]] aboard his ship, ''Betsy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faning Islands (Tabuaeran) Paper Money|publisher=Numismondo|url=http://www.numismondo.com/pm/fai/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1798 [[Teraina]]'''
* Teraina, also known as Washington Island, is an inhabited coral atoll located in the central [[Pacific Ocean]] that is {{convert|282|nmi|km}} north of the [[equator]], {{convert|75|mi|km}} northwest of [[Tabuaeran]], {{convert|238|mi|km}} northwest of [[Christmas Island]], and {{convert|120|mi|km}} southeast of the U.S. territory of [[Palmyra Atoll]]. Formerly under British rule, Teraina is now a part of the [[Republic of Kiribati]]. Obsolete names of Teraina are Prospect Island and New York Island. The island consists of nine [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] villages. Teraina was discovered by U.S. Captain [[Edmund Fanning]], in the American ship ''Betsy'', on June 12, 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington Island|publisher=Jane Resture|url=http://www.janeresture.com/kiribati_line/washington.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1798 [[Palmyra Atoll]]'''
[[File:PalmyraNorthBeach.jpg|180px|left|thumb|[[Palmyra Atoll]]'s North Beach.]]
Palmyra Atoll, a [[territory of the United States]], a [[Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument]], and a part of the wider [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]], is a {{convert|4.6|sqmi|abbr=on}} atoll located in the [[North Pacific Ocean]] almost due south of the [[Hawaiian Islands]], roughly halfway between the U.S. state of [[Hawaii]] and the U.S. territory of [[American Samoa]]. The atoll consists of an extensive reef, two shallow lagoons, and some 50 sand and reef-rock islets and bars covered with lush, tropical vegetation. The islets of the atoll are all connected, except Sand Island and the two Home Islets in the west and Barren Island in the east. The largest island is Cooper Island in the north, followed by Kaula Island in the south. Cooper Island is privately owned by [[The Nature Conservancy]] and managed as a nature reserve. The rest of the atoll is managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] and is directly administered by the [[Office of Insular Affairs]], an agency of the [[United States Department of Interior]]. Palmyra Atoll's history is long and colorful. It was first sighted on June 14, 1798, by Captain [[Edmund Fanning]] and officially discovered in 1802 by Captain Sawle of the American ship ''Palmyra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge|publisher=United States Fish and Wildlife Service|url=http://www.fws.gov/refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=12533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1798 [[Kingman Reef]]'''
* Kingman Reef, a [[territory of the United States]], a [[Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument]], and a part of the wider [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]], is a largely submerged, uninhabited triangular shaped reef, 9.5 nautical miles (18 kilometers) east-west and 5 nautical miles (9 kilometers) north-south, located in the [[North Pacific Ocean]], roughly halfway between the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and the U.S. territory of [[American Samoa]]. It is the northernmost of the [[Northern Line Islands]] and lies 36 nautical miles (67 kilometers) northwest of the next closest island, the U.S. territory of [[Palmyra Atoll]], and 930 nautical miles (1,720 kilometers) south of [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. Kingman Reef is now administered and managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], an agency of the [[United States Department of Interior]]. First known as "Dangerous Reef", Kingman Reef was discovered on June 14, 1798 by U.S. Captain [[Edmund Fanning]].&lt;ref name="U.S. Unincorporated Possessions"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Unincorporated Possessions|publisher=Ben Cahoon|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/US_minor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1821 [[South Orkney Islands]]'''
* The South Orkney Islands are a group of islands in the [[Southern Ocean]], about {{convert|375|mi|km}} northeast of the tip of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. As part of the [[British Antarctic Territory]], the islands have a total area of about {{convert|240|sqmi|km2}}. In December 1821, Captain [[Nathaniel B. Palmer]] as commander of the ''James Monroe'', along with British sealer George Powell, co-discovered the South Orkney Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Antarctic Time Line: 1519 - 1959|publisher=South Pole.com|url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000052.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1822 [[Howland Island]]'''
* Howland Island, a [[territory of the United States]] and a part of the [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]],  is an uninhabited coral island located just north of the equator in the central Pacific Ocean, about 1,700 nautical miles (3,100&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii. The island lies almost halfway between the U. S state of Hawaii and Australia. Its nearest neighbor is [[Baker Island]], 37 nautical miles (68 kilometers) to the south. Now known as a [[National Wildlife Refuge]], Howland Island is an [[insular area]] administered and managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]. First known as "Worth Island", Howland Island as it later was named, was discovered by U.S. Captain George B.

* Baker Island, a [[territory of the United States]] and a part of the [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]], is an uninhabited atoll located just north of the equator in the central [[Pacific Ocean]] about 1,700 miles (3,100 kilometers) southwest of [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. The island lies almost halfway between the U.S. state of [[Hawaii]] and [[Australia]]. Its nearest neighbor is [[Howland Island]], 37 nautical miles (68 kilometers) to the north. Now known as a [[National Wildlife Refuge]], Baker Island is an [[insular area]] administered and managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]. According to an article in ''Pacific Magazine'' dated in 2000, Baker island was reportedly first sighted in 1825 by U.S. Captain [[Starbuck (whaling family)#Obed Starbuck|Obed Starbuck]] in the ship ''Lopez''. The newly discovered island was named New Nantucket (and also as Phoebe). It was in 1832 that U.S. Captain Michael Baker, after whom the island is now named, also came to the island aboard the whaler ''Gideon Howard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baker Island (U.S. Minor Outlying Islands)|publisher=Flags of the World|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/um-baker.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadrosaurus was a dubious genus of a hadrosaurid dinosaur that lived near what is now the coast of New Jersey in the late [[Cretaceous]], around 80 million years ago. It was likely bipedal for the purposes of running, but could use its forelegs to support itself while grazing. Like all hadrosaurids, Hadrosaurus was herbivorous. Its teeth suggest it ate twigs and leaves. In the summer of 1858 while vacationing in Haddonfield, New Jersey, [[William Parker Foulke]] discovered the world's first nearly-complete skeleton of any species of dinosaur, the Hadrosaurus (named by [[Joseph Leidy]]), an event that would rock the scientific world and forever change our view of natural history. To this day, Haddonfield, New Jersey is considered to be "ground zero" of dinosaur paleontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding the World's First Dinosaur Skeleton Hadrosaurus foulki|publisher=Hoag Levins|url=http://www.levins.com/dinosaur.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midway Atoll, better known as Midway Island or collectively as the Midway islands, is a [[territory of the United States]] and a part of the wider [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]] that is located in the [[North Pacific Ocean]] near the northwestern end of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. As a 2.4-square-mile (6.2&amp;nbsp;km²) atoll, Midway Atoll is one-third of the way between [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] and [[Tokyo, Japan]], approximately 140 nautical miles (259 kilometers) east of the [[International Date Line]], about 2,800 nautical miles (5,200 kilometers) west of [[San Francisco, California]], and 2,200 nautical miles (4,100 kilometers) east of Tokyo, Japan. Midway Atoll consists of a ring-shaped barrier reef and several sand islets. The two significant pieces of land, Sand Island and Eastern Island, provide habitat for millions of seabirds. Because of the importance of marine and biological environment, Midway Atoll is an insular area known as the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge that is administered and managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], an agency of the [[United States Department of Interior]]. Midway Atoll is perhaps best known as the site of the [[Battle of Midway]], fought in [[World War II]] on June 4–6, 1942 and the decisive turning point of the [[Pacific War]] when the [[United States Navy]] defeated an attack by the [[Empire of Japan]]. First known as "Middlebrooks Islands", Midway Atoll was discovered by U.S. Captain N.C.

'''1889 [[Torosaurus]]'''

Torosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the [[Late Cretaceous Period]] about 70 million years ago in what is now North America. Torosaurus had an enormous head that measured 8 feet (2.5 m) in length. Its skull is one of the largest know up to date, no other land animal has ever had a skull larger than Torosaurus. Torosaurus frill made up about one-half the total skull length. The first fossils of Torosaurus were discovered in 1889, in Wyoming by [[John Bell Hatcher]]. The American paleontologist [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] would later name the specimen ''Torosaurus latus'', in recognition of the bull-like size of its skull and its large eyebrow horns. Ever since, the specimen has been in display at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|Peabody Museum]] in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Torosaurus latus|publisher=Planet Dinosaur|url=http://www.planetdinosaur.com/dinosaurs_by_category/north_american_dinosaurs/torosaurus_latus.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thescelosaurus was a bipedal dinosaur with a sturdy build, small wide hands, and a long pointed snout from the Late Cretaceous Period, approximately 66 million years ago. As a herbivore, Thescelosaurus was not a tall dinosaur and probably browsed the ground selectively to find food. Its leg structure and proportionally heavy build suggests that it was not a fast runner like other dinosaurs. The first fossils of Thescelosaurus were co-discovered in 1891 by [[John Bell Hatcher]] and William H. Utterback, in Wyoming. However, this discovery remained stored until [[Charles W.

Its important part is the retinyl group, which can be found in several forms. In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester, primarily retinyl palmitate, which is converted to an alcohol in the small intestine. Vitamin A can also exist as an aldehyde, or as an acid. The discovery of vitamin A stemmed from research dating back to 1906, indicating that factors other than carbohydrates, proteins, and fats were necessary to keep cattle healthy. By 1917 one of these substances was independently discovered by [[Elmer McCollum]] at the University of Wisconsin–Madison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vitamin A|publisher=Hyper Physics|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/HBASE/organic/vitamina.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lafayette Mendel]] and Thomas Osborne at Yale University.

'''1927 [[Electron diffraction]]'''
* Electron diffraction is a collective scattering phenomenon with electrons being scattered by atoms in a regular crystal array. This can be understood in analogy to the Huygens principle for the diffraction of light. The incoming plane electron wave interacts with the atoms, and secondary waves are generated which interfere with each other. In 1927, two Americans named [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] had proven [[Matter wave|de Broglie's theory]] by discovering electron diffraction. This confirmation of the wavelike nature of an electron was discovered independently of Englishman [[George Paget Thomson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantum Physics Timeline|publisher=Craville Studies|url=http://www.craville.110mb.com/physics/quantum.htm#Wave-like_Nature_of_Electrons:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Jones Diamond is a bluish-white diamond weighing 34.48 carats (6.896 g), measuring 5/8 of an inch (15.8&amp;nbsp;mm) across, and possessing 12 diamond-shaped faces. It is considered to be the largest alluvial diamond from North America. The Jones Diamond was discovered by William P. "Punch" Jones and his father Grover while pitching horseshoes in 1928. They thought the stone was a piece of quartz which was common in the area. Keeping it in a cigar box in their tool shed for 14 years, the Jones's sent the gem to the geology department at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute]] in 1942 where they were informed that it was an alluvial diamond and not a quartz crystal. The diamond was then sent to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington D.C. for safekeeping until 1964, when it returned to the Jones family who kept it for another 20 years in a safe deposit box at their local bank in Virginia. In 1984, the Jones family finally sold the diamond at [[Sotheby's]] auction in New York City to a private collector of jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=51 Famous and Historic Diamonds|publisher=Abazias Diamonds|url=http://www.abazias.com/education/news/gem_stone_education/51_famous_diamonds.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clyde W. Tombaugh.jpeg|180px|left|thumb|[[Clyde William Tombaugh]], the American astronomer who discovered [[Pluto]] in 1930.]]
Following the discovery of the planet Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century but culminated at the start of the 20th century with a quest for Planet X. [[Percival Lowell]] proposed the Planet X hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the gas giants, particularly Uranus and Neptune, speculating that the gravity of a large unseen planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities. The discovery of Pluto by [[Clyde Tombaugh]] in 1930 initially appeared to validate Lowell's hypothesis, and [[Pluto]] was considered the ninth planet until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding Pluto: Tough Task, Even 75 Years Later|publisher=Imaginova Corp.|url=http://www.space.com/spacewatch/050311_pluto_guide.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1980 [[Oncogene]]'''
* An oncogene is a gene that is mutated or expressed at high levels, and thus helps turn a normal cell into a tumor cell. In the late 1970s, [[Robert Weinberg]] and his team of researchers began the search for a human oncogene. Using gene transfer techniques, researchers in his lab inserted DNA from human bladder tumor cells into normal animal cells. When the animal cells turned cancerous, Dr. Weinberg's associates began inserting smaller pieces of DNA into the normal cell. By 1980, they found a single fragment that turned the normal cell cancerous. This gene was found to belong to a sub-family of related genes, called [[Ras subfamily|ras]], that was later discovered to play a role in causing bladder, lung, and colon cancer in both rats and humans. More results emerged in 1982 when Dr. Weinberg's laboratory discovered that a single, subtle genetic glitch in this oncogene topples the delicate balance between a bladder cell's normal and cancerous states.&lt;ref name="wi.mit.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert A.

First launched in 1715 from London, England, the ''Whydah'' was a three-masted ship of galley-style design measuring {{convert|105|ft|m}} in length, rated at 300 tons burden, and could travel at speeds up to {{convert|14.95|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Christened ''Whydah'' after the West African slave trading kingdom of [[Ouidah]], the vessel was configured as a heavily armed trading and transport ship for use in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], carrying goods from England to exchange for slaves in [[West Africa]]. It would then travel to the Caribbean to trade the slaves for precious metals, sugar, indigo, and medicinal ingredients, which would then be transported back to England. Captained by the English pirate [[Samuel Bellamy|"Black Sam" Bellamy]], the ''Whydah'', on April 26, 1717, sailed into a violent storm dangerously close to [[Cape Cod]] and was eventually driven onto the shoals at [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts]]. At midnight she hit a sandbar in {{convert|16|ft|m}} of water some {{convert|500|ft|m}} from the coast of what is now Marconi Beach. Pummelled by {{convert|70|mi|km|adj=on}}-an-hour winds and 30 to {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} waves, the main mast snapped, pulling the ship into some {{convert|30|ft|m}} of water where she violently capsized, taking Bellamy, all but two of his 145 men, and over 4.5 tons of gold, silver and jewels with it. After years of exhaustive searching, it was in 1984 that world headlines were made when American archeological explorer [[Barry Clifford]] found the only solidly-identified pirate shipwreck ever discovered, the ''Whydah''.

The RMS ''Titanic'' was an [[Olympic class ocean liner|''Olympic'' class]] passenger liner owned by the [[White Star Line]] and was built at the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard in Belfast, in what is now Northern Ireland. At the time of her construction, she was the largest passenger steamship in the world. Shortly before midnight on April 14, 1912, four days into the ship's maiden voyage, ''Titanic'' struck an iceberg and sank two hours and forty minutes later, early on April 15, 1912. The sinking resulted in the deaths of 1,517 of the 2,223 people on board, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. After nearly 74 years of being lost at sea on the bottom of the ocean floor, a joint Franco-American expedition led by American oceanographer [[Robert Ballard|Dr. Robert D.

Ballard was then forced to wait a year for weather conditions favorable to a manned mission to view the wreck at close range. In 1986, Ballard and his two-man crew, in the [[ALVIN]] submersible, made the first two and-a-half hour descent to the ocean floor to view the wreck first-hand.

'''1986 [[Tumor suppressor gene]]'''
* A tumor suppressor gene, or anti-oncogene, is a gene that protects a cell from one step on the path to cancer. When this gene is mutated to cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer, usually in combination with other genetic changes. In 1986, [[Robert Weinberg]] and a team of researchers working under his direction made a seminal discovery when they isolated Rb, or the [[retinoblastoma protein]], the first known growth-suppressor gene.&lt;ref name="wi.mit.edu"/&gt;

'''1989 [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'' wreckage]]'''
* The German battleship ''Bismarck'' was one of the most famous warships of [[World War II]]. As the lead ship of the {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship|4}}, and named after the 19th century German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], ''Bismarck'' displaced more than 50,000 tonnes fully loaded and was the largest warship then commissioned. Fleet Air Arm Swordfish biplanes launched from the carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} torpedoed the ship and jammed her rudder, allowing Royal Navy units to catch up with her. In the ensuing battle on the morning of May 27, 1941, ''Bismarck'' was heavily attacked for almost two hours before sinking. After the discovery of the wreckage of the {{RMS|Titanic}} in 1985, [[Robert Ballard|Dr. Robert D. Ballard's]] next goal was to find and film the wreck of the ''Bismarck''. The search for the wreck began in July 1988, but his first expedition brought no success. A second expedition was mounted in late May 1989, and on June 8, 1989, after combing an area of some {{convert|200|sqmi|km2}}, Ballard and his team finally found ''Bismarck{{'}}s'' remains. The wreck lies in the bottom of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] some {{convert|600|mi|km}} west of Brest, France at a depth of 4,790 meters (15,700&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The wreck of the Bismarck |publisher=KBismarck.com|url=http://www.kbismarck.com/wreck.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Strawn-Wagner Diamond was discovered in 1990 at the [[Crater of Diamonds State Park]] by Shirley Strawn of Murfreesboro, Arkansas.&lt;ref name="Famous Finds"/&gt;

'''1993 [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]]'''

* Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was a comet that broke apart and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its role in reducing space debris in the inner solar system. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was co-discovered photographically by the husband and wife scientific team of [[Carolyn S. Shoemaker]] and [[Eugene M. Shoemaker]] along with Canadian-born astronomer [[David H. Levy]] on March 24, 1993, using the 0.46-m (18-in.) Schmidt telescope at [[Palomar Observatory]] in California. Its discovery was a serendipitous product of their continuing search for "near-Earth objects", and the "9" indicates that it was the ninth short-period comet (period less than 200 years) discovered by this team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 4: The Discovery and Early Study of Shoemaker-Levy 9|publisher=Ray L. Newburn, Jr.|url=http://seds.org/archive/sl9/Educator/section04.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1995 [[Top quark]]'''
* The top quark is the third-generation up-type quark with a charge of +(2/3)e. It was discovered in 1995 by the [[Collider Detector at Fermilab|CDF]] and [[D0 experiment|D0]] experiments at Fermilab and is the most massive of known elementary particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inquiring Minds|publisher=Fermni National Accelerator Laboratory|url=http://www.fnal.gov/pub/inquiring/physics/discoveries/top_quark.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1995 [[Comet Hale-Bopp]]'''
* Comet Hale-Bopp was arguably the most widely observed comet of the 20th century, and one of the brightest seen for many decades and it was visible to the naked eye for a record 18 months when it passed near planet Earth. Hale-Bopp was discovered by [[Alan Hale (astronomer)|Alan Hale]] and [[Thomas Bopp]] on July 23, 1995 at a great distance from the Sun, raising expectations that the comet would brighten considerably by the time it passed close to Earth. Although predicting the brightness of comets with any degree of accuracy is very difficult, Hale-Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The discovery of Comet Hale–Bopp|publisher=NASA|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/discovery.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1998 [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|USS ''Yorktown'' (CV-5) wreckage]]'''
* The third USS ''Yorktown'' in the [[United States Navy]], lead ship of the ''[[Yorktown class aircraft carrier|Yorktown class]]'' of aircraft carriers, was laid down on May 21, 1934 at Newport News, Virginia, by the [[Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company]]. ''Yorktown'' was launched on April 4, 1936, sponsored by First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and commissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, on September 30, 1937 with Captain Ernest D. McWhorter in command. ''Yorktown'' was hit by air-launched torpedoes during the [[Battle of Midway]] on June 6, 1942. ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|Hiryū]]'', the sole surviving Japanese aircraft carrier, wasted little time in counter-attacking. The first wave of Japanese dive bombers badly damaged ''Yorktown'' with three bomb hits that snuffed out her boilers, immobilizing her, yet her damage control teams patched her up so effectively that the second wave's torpedo bombers mistook her for an undamaged carrier. Despite Japanese hopes to even the odds by eliminating two carriers with two strikes, ''Yorktown'' absorbed both Japanese attacks, the second wave mistakenly believing Yorktown had already been sunk and they were attacking {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}. After two torpedo hits, ''Yorktown'' lost power and developed a 26° list to port, which put her out of action and forced Admiral [[Frank J. Fletcher]] to move his command staff to the heavy cruiser Astoria. The second attempt at salvage, however, would never be made. Throughout the night of June 6 and into the morning of June 7, ''Yorktown'' remained stubbornly afloat. By 0530 on June 7, however, the men in the ships nearby noted that the carrier's list was rapidly increasing to port. At 0701, the ship turned over on her port side and sank in 3,000 fathoms (5,500 m) of water, her battle flags still flying. On May 19, 1998, the wreck of the ''Yorktown'' was discovered by [[Robert Ballard|Dr. Robert D. Ballard]], American oceanographer and discoverer of the wreck of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. The wreck of the ''Yorktown'' was found {{convert|3|mi|km}} beneath the surface and was photographed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USS Yorktown CV-5|publisher=Pacific Wrecks Incorporated|url=http://www.pacificwrecks.com/ships/usn/CV-5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1998 [[Stem cell|Embryonic stem cell lines]]'''
* A breakthrough in human embryonic stem cell research came in November 1998 when a group led by [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|Dr. James Thomson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Thomson: shifts from embryonic stem cells to induced pluripotency|publisher=Nature|url=http://www.nature.com/stemcells/2008/0808/080814/full/stemcells.2008.118.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Wisconsin–Madison first discovered a technique in order to isolate and grow cells which derived from human blastocysts, could one day lead to major medical advancements in organ transplantation as well as gene therapy and treatment of maladies such as paralysis, diabetes, cancer, and AIDS.

'''2003 [[Perdita (moon)|Perdita]]'''
* Perdita is an inner satellite of [[Uranus]]. Perdita's discovery was complicated. The first photographs of Perdita were taken by the [[Voyager 2]] spacecraft in 1986, but it was not recognized from the photographs for more than a decade. In 1999, the moon was noticed by [[Erich Karkoschka]] and reported. Because no further pictures could be taken to confirm its existence, it was officially demoted in 2001. However, in 2003, pictures taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] managed to pick up an object where Perdita was supposed to be, finally confirming its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perdita|publisher=astrowww.pl|url=http://ksiezyce.astrowww.pl/uranus/perdita_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2005 [[KV63|KV63 at the Valley of the Kings]]'''
* KV63 is the most recently opened chamber in Egypt's [[Valley of the Kings]] pharaonic necropolis. Initially believed to be a royal tomb, it is now believed to have been an ancient storage chamber for the mummification process. The 2005 discovery of KV63, located about {{convert|50|ft|m}} away from King Tut's tomb, is credited to American Egyptologist [[Otto Schaden|Dr. Otto Schaden]] and his team from the University of Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= KV 63: A Look at the New Tomb|publisher=Archaeological Institute of America|url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/wilson/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2007 [[human genome|Human genome and variation mapping]]'''
* The human genome is the genome of Homo sapiens, which is stored on 23 chromosome pairs. Whereas a genome sequence lists the order of every DNA base in a genome, a genome map identifies the landmarks. A genome map is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in navigating around the genome. While working at the National Institute of Health, [[Craig Venter]] discovered a technique for rapidly identifying all of the mRNAs present in a cell, and began to use it to identify human brain genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10 Scientific Discoveries|publisher=Time Inc.|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686252_1690928,00.html | date=December 9, 2007 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short cDNA sequence fragments discovered by this method are called expressed sequence tags. Through his scientific research of bringing the world one step closer to personalized medicine, Craig Venter was listed on Time Magazine's 2007 and 2008 Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.

'''2007 [[Di-positronium]]'''
* The di-positronium is a molecule consisting of two atoms of positronium.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1483">A '''watchman's chair''' is a design of [[upholstery|unupholstered]] wood construction featuring a forward slanted seat, such that the [[Security guard|watchman]] could not readily fall asleep without sliding downward and off the front of the chair. The design was developed in Western Europe, and was used from late medieval times well into the 19th century.  Currently this [[antique furniture]] item is found primarily in the possession of collectors and [[museum]]s.

==In literature==
There are a number of references to the watchman's chair in literature such as the allusion to its use in Collins's ''Jezebel''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/Jezebel6/#p22 ''Jezebel'' by Wilkie Collins]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sir Toby was described to be sitting in a canopied watchman's chair in one of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shakespeare Season at The Old Vic, 1957-58 and Stratford-upon-Avon, 1958'', M. St. Clare Byrne, Shakespeare Quarterly, Vol. 9, No. 4 (Autumn, 1958), pp. 507-530&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative use of the term==
This article is not about the "watchman's chair" deriving from the Congo, which has a traditional [[Africa]]n design.
