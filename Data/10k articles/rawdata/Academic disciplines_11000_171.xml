      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8126">{{About|the property of two-dimensional objects|computer storage comparisons|Areal density (computer storage)|other uses|Density (disambiguation)}}

The '''areal density''' (also known as '''area density''', '''surface density''', '''superficial density''', or '''density thickness''') of a two-dimensional object is calculated as the [[mass]] per unit [[area]]. The [[SI]] derived unit is: [[kilogram]] per square metre (kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). In the paper and fabric industries, it is called [[grammage]] and is expressed in grams per square meter (gsm); for paper in particular, it may be expressed as pounds per [[paper ream|ream]] of standard sizes ("basis ream").

== Formulation ==
It can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_A = \frac {m} {A} &lt;/math&gt;

or
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_A = \rho \cdot l&lt;/math&gt;

where,
:{|
|-
|''{{math|ρ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;}}'' || = average area density
|-
|''{{math|m}}''             || = total mass of the object
|-
|''{{math|A}}''             || = total area of the object
|-
|''{{math|ρ}}''             || = average [[density]]
|-
|''{{math|l}}''             || = average thickness of the object
|}

== Column density ==
A special type of area density is called '''column (mass) density''' (also '''columnar mass density'''), denoted ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; or ''σ''. It is the [[mass]] of [[chemical substance|substance]] per unit [[area]] [[integral|integrated]] along a path;&lt;ref name="Boeker_vanGrondelle2000"&gt;
{{cite book
 |author1=Egbert Boeker |author2=Rienk van Grondelle | title=Environmental Physics 
 | edition=2nd
 | year=2000
 | publisher=Wiley
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is obtained integrating [[density|volumetric density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; over a column:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Visconti | first1 = Guido | title = Fundamentals of physics and chemistry of the atmosphere | year = 2001 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin  | isbn = 978-3-540-67420-7 | pages = 470 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\int \rho \; \operatorname{d}s.&lt;/math&gt;

In general the integration path can be slant or oblique incidence (as in, for example, [[line of sight propagation]] in [[atmospheric physics]]). A common special case is a vertical path, from the bottom to the top of the medium:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \int \rho \; \operatorname{d}z&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; denotes the vertical coordinate (e.g., height or depth).

Columnar density &lt;math&gt;\rho_A&lt;/math&gt; is closely related to the vertically averaged volumetric density &lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho} = \frac{\rho_A}{\Delta z},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta z = \int 1 \; \operatorname{d}z&lt;/math&gt;; notice that &lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho_A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; have units of, for example, grams per cubic metre, grams per square metre, and metres, respectively.

=== Column number density ===
'''Column number density''' refers instead to a [[number density]] type of quantity: the number or count of a substance—rather than the mass—per unit area integrated along a path:
:&lt;math&gt;N = \int n \; \operatorname{d}s.&lt;/math&gt;

==Usage==

===Atmospheric physics===
It is a quantity commonly retrieved by [[remote sensing]] instruments, for instance the [[Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer]] (TOMS) which retrieves ozone columns around the globe.  Columns are also returned by the [[differential absorption spectroscopy|differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS)]] method&lt;ref name="Sinreich_etal2008"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related concept is that of ice or [[liquid water path]], which specifies the volume per unit area or depth instead of mass per unit area, thus the two are related:
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{\sigma}{\rho_0}&lt;/math&gt;,

Another closely related concept is [[optical depth]].

===Astronomy===
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}

In Astronomy the column density is generally used to indicate the number of atoms or molecules per square cm (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) along the line of sight in a particular direction, as derived from observations of e.g. the 21-cm [[hydrogen line]] or from observations of a certain molecular species. Also the [[Extinction (astronomy)|interstellar extinction]] can be related to the column density of H or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/C/Column+Density&lt;/ref&gt;.

The concept of area density can be useful when analysing [[accretion disk]]s. In the case of a disk seen face-on, area density for a given area of the disk is defined as column density: that is, either as the [[mass]] of [[chemical substance|substance]] per unit [[area]] [[integral|integrated]] along the vertical path that goes through the disk [[Sightline|(line-of-sight)]], from the bottom to the top of the medium:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \int \rho \; \operatorname{d}z&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; denotes the vertical coordinate (e.g., height or depth), or as the number or count of a substance—rather than the mass—per unit area integrated along a path (column number density):

:&lt;math&gt;N = \int n \; \operatorname{d}z.&lt;/math&gt;

===Data storage media===
{{Main article|Areal density (computer storage)}}
Areal density is used to quantify and compare different types media used in data storage devices such as [[hard disk drives]], [[optical disc|optical disc drives]] and [[tape drives]].  The current unit of measure is typically gigabits per square inch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/areal_density.html |title=Areal Density |publisher=Webopedia |accessdate= April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper===
{{main|grammage}}
The area density is often used to describe the thickness of paper; e.g., 80&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is very common.

===Fabric===
{{main|grammage}}
Fabric "weight" is often specified as mass per unit area, grams per square meter (gsm) or [[ounce]]s per square yard. It is also sometimes specified in ounces per yard in a standard width for the particular cloth. One gram per square meter equals 0.0295 ounces per square yard; one ounce per square yard equals 33.9 grams per square meter.

===Other===

It is also an important quantity for the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption of radiation]]. 

When studying bodies falling through air, area density is important because resistance depends on area, and gravitational force is dependent on mass.

[[Bone density]] is often expressed in grams per square centimeter (g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) as measured by x-ray absorptiometry, as a proxy for the actual density.

The [[body mass index]] is expressed in units of kilograms per square meter, though the area figure is nominal, being simply the square of the height.

The [[total electron content]] in the ionosphere is a quantity of type columnar number density.

[[Snow water equivalent]] is a quantity of type columnar mass density.

However, it is argued that the emotional role-playing between the care-receiver and a robot can actually have a more positive outcome in terms of creating the conditions of less fear and concern for one's own predicament best exemplified by the phrase: "if it is just a robot taking care of me it cannot be that critical." Scholars debate the possible outcome of such technology using two different perspectives. Either, the AE could help the socialization of care-givers, or serve as role model for emotional detachment.&lt;ref name="Baumgaertner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asada"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Affective Developmental Robotics |work=How can we design the development of artifcial empathy? |author=Minoru Asada |publisher=Dept. of Adaptive Machine Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University |location=Osaka, Japan |url=http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~kl360/HRI2014W/submission/S7.pdf |format=PDF |via=direct download |date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australian Aboriginal astronomy''' is a name given to [[indigenous Australian]] culture relating to [[astronomy|astronomical]] subjects&amp;nbsp;– such as the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], the [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and the [[Milky Way]], and their motions on the sky.

One of the earliest records of indigenous astronomy was made by William Edward Stanbridge, an Englishman who emigrated to Australia in 1841 and befriended the local [[Wergaia|Boorong people]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/indigenous-belief-enlightens-astronomers.htm/ Aboriginal Astronomers: World's Oldest?], Australian Geographic, 28 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A recent comprehensive review
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dawes Review 5: Australian Aboriginal Astronomy and Navigation|date=2 August 2016| journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia | volume=33 |page=39|arxiv=1607.02215|bibcode=2016PASA...33...39N|doi=10.1017/pasa.2016.25|last1 = Norris|first1 = Ray P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
summarises all published research on Aboriginal Astronomy up to 2016.

Some Aboriginal groups use the motions of celestial bodies for [[calendar]] purposes. Many attribute religious or mythological meanings to celestial bodies and phenomena. There is a diversity of astronomical traditions in Australia, each with its own particular expression of [[cosmology]]. However, there appear to be common themes and systems between the groups.

==Interpreting the sky==

===Emu in the sky===
[[Image:Emu public.jpg|frame|The Aboriginal "[[Emu]] in the sky". In Western astronomy terms, the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] is on the right, and [[Scorpius]] on the left; the head of the emu is the [[Coalsack]].]]

A constellation used in Aboriginal culture in Australia is the "[[Emu]] in the sky", a '[[constellation]]' that is defined by [[dark nebula]]e (opaque clouds of dust and gas in outer space) that are visible against the Milky Way background, rather than by stars.&lt;ref name=EmuPD1/&gt; The Emu's head is the very dark [[Coalsack]] nebula, next to the [[Southern Cross]]; the body and legs are other dark clouds trailing out along the Milky Way to [[Scorpius]].&lt;ref name=EmuPD1&gt;{{cite book |title=The Emu in the Sky: Stories about the Aboriginals and the day and night skies. The emu in the sky is shown in the dark space between stars° - The Emu |pages=15, 16 |author=Peter D'Arcy |editor=Margo Sutton |year=1994 |publisher=The National Science and Technology Centre |isbn=978-0-64618-202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park]], north of Sydney, are extensive [[Sydney Rock Engravings|rock engravings]] of the [[Guringai]] people who lived there, including representations of the creator-hero [[Daramulan]] and his emu-wife. An engraving near the Elvina Track&lt;ref name="Wild"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elvina Bay Aboriginal Engraving Walk|url=http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/ku-ring-gai-chase-national-park/elvina-bay-aboriginal-engraving-walk.html|publisher=Wild Walks|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows an emu in the same pose and orientation as the Emu in the Sky constellation. 

To the [[Wardaman people|Wardaman]], however, the Coalsack is the head of a lawman.&lt;ref name="harney05"&gt;Yidumduma Harney (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canoe in Orion===
The [[Yolngu]] people of northern Australia say that the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], which they call Julpan (or Djulpan), is a [[canoe]]. They tell the story of three brothers who went fishing, and one of them ate a sawfish that was forbidden under their law. Seeing this, the Sun-woman, Walu, made a waterspout that carried him and his two brothers and their canoe up into the sky. The three suns that line in the constellation's centre, which form [[Orion's Belt]] in Western mythology, are the three brothers; the [[Orion Nebula]] above them is the forbidden fish; and the bright stars [[Betelgeuse]] and [[Rigel]] are the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and [[stern]] of the canoe. This is an example of astronomical legends underpinning the ethical and social codes that people use on Earth.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt;

===Pleiades===
The [[Pleiades]] also figures in the [[Dreaming (spirituality)|Dreaming]]s of several language groups. For example, in the central desert region, they are said to be seven sisters fleeing from the unwelcome attentions of a man represented by some of the stars in Orion. The close resemblance of this to [[Greek mythology]] is believed to be coincidental&amp;nbsp;— there is no evidence of any cultural connection.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt;

The [[Wurundjeri]] people of the [[Kulin]] nation explain them in the [[Karatgurk]] story. Another story involves seven sisters, the Maya-Mayi who were so beautiful that a warrior, Warrumma, kidnaps two of them. They eventually escape by climbing a pine tree that continually grows up into the sky where they join their other sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Emu in the Sky: Stories about the Aboriginals and the day and night skies - The Seven Sisters (The Pleiades) |pages=5–6 |author=Peter D'Arcy |editor=Margo Sutton |year=1994 |publisher=The National Science and Technology Centre |isbn=978-0-64618-202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, stars were commonly used to measure time and the seasons and to regulate daily activities before written culture, and long after in some cultures. The myths of the Australian Aboriginal people are, as around the world, to do with moral lessons and various reminders such as when to eat certain types of food, which is itself a cultural connection in the general form of the stories. Therefore, the study of the stars is probably the oldest knowledge on earth, such that it remains an intriguing possibility that aboriginal star knowledge does contain some fragments of a much older original culture. Aboriginal people came to Australia from Asia 50,000&amp;nbsp;years ago (well before Greek culture formed 3,000–4,000&amp;nbsp;years ago), and presumably the Aboriginal people originally came from Africa. While there is no hard evidence of a cultural connection, the possibility should not be written off, and the door is open to research to construct models of older human cultures, through the tracing of these narratives and other means such as linguistics.&lt;ref name="Aboriginal Astronomy Mysteries"&gt;[http://www.mmnet.com.au/australian_landscape_photos/writer/Aboriginal_astronomy.html Aboriginal Astronomy Mysteries]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Milky Way===
The [[Yolngu]] people believe that when they die, they are taken by a mystical canoe, ''Larrpan'', to the spirit-island [[Baralku]] in the sky, where their camp-fires can be seen burning along the edge of the great river of the Milky Way. The canoe is sent back to earth as a shooting star, letting their family on Earth know that they have arrived safely in the spirit-land. Aboriginals also thought that god was the canoe. &lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt;

The [[Wergaia|Boorong]] people see in the [[Southern Cross]] a [[Phalangeriformes|possum]] in a tree.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt;

===Sun and Moon===
Many traditions have stories of a female [[Sun]] and a male [[Moon]].

The Yolngu say that [[Walu (mythology)|Walu]], the Sun-woman, lights a small fire each morning, which we see as the dawn.&lt;ref name="wells64"&gt;Wells (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; She paints herself with [[red ochre]], some of which spills onto the clouds, creating the sunrise. She then lights a torch and carries it across the sky from east to west, creating daylight. At the end of her journey, as she descends from the sky, some of her ochre paints again rubs off onto the clouds, creating the sunset. She then puts out her torch, and throughout the night travels underground back to her starting camp in the east.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt; Other Aboriginals of the Northern Territory call her [[Wuriupranili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Emu in the Sky: Stories about the Aboriginals and the day and night skies - The Sun |pages=3, 4 |author=Peter D'Arcy |editor=Margo Sutton |year=1994 |publisher=The National Science and Technology Centre |isbn=978-0-64618-202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other stories about the Sun involve [[Wala (goddess)|Wala]], [[Yhi]], and [[Gnowee]].

The Yolngu tell that [[Ngalindi]], the Moon-man, was once young and slim (the [[waxing Moon]]), but grew fat and lazy (the [[full Moon]]). His wives chopped bits off him with their axes (the [[waning Moon]]); to escape them he climbed a tall tree towards the Sun, but died from the wounds (the [[new Moon]]). After remaining dead for three days, he rose again to repeat the cycle, and continues doing so till this day.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt; The [[Kuwema]] people in the [[Northern Territory]] say that he grows fat at each full Moon by devouring the spirits of those who disobey the tribal laws.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wells64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hulley96"&gt;Hulley (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Another story by the Aboriginals of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] involves the making of a giant [[boomerang]] that is thrown into the sky and becomes the Moon.&lt;ref name=EmuPD2/&gt;

A story from Southern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] concerns a beautiful woman who is forced to live by herself in the sky after a number of scandalous [[Affair|affairs]].&lt;ref name=EmuPD2&gt;{{cite book |title=The Emu in the Sky: Stories about the Aboriginals and the day and night skies - The Moon |pages=7, 8 |author=Peter D'Arcy |editor=Margo Sutton |year=1994 |publisher=The National Science and Technology Centre |isbn=978-0-64618-202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yolngu also associated the Moon with the [[tide]]s.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt;

===Eclipses===
The [[Warlpiri people]] explain a [[solar eclipse]] as being the Sun-woman being hidden by the Moon-man as he makes love to her.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt; This explanation is shared by other groups, such as the [[Wirangu]].

In the [[Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park]] there are a number of engravings showing a crescent shape, with sharp horns pointing down, and below it a drawing of a man in front of a woman. While the crescent shape has been assumed by most researchers to represent a boomerang, some argue that it is more easily interpreted as a solar eclipse, with the mythical man-and-woman explanation depicted below it.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt;

===Venus===
The rising of [[Venus]] marks an important ceremony of the Yolngu, who call it [[Barnumbirr]] ("Morning Star and Evening Star") They gather after sunset to await the rising of the planet. As she approaches, in the early hours before dawn, the Yolngu say that she draws behind her a rope of light attached to the island of [[Baralku]] on Earth, and along this rope, with the aid of a richly decorated "Morning Star Pole", the people are able to communicate with their dead loved ones, showing that they still love and remember them.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt;

===Jupiter===
The [[Dja Dja Wurrung]] call [[Jupiter]] "[[Bunjil]]'s campfire". The [[planet]] features in the Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation logo, as a symbol of the Creator Spirit&lt;ref name="DjaDjaWurrungSettlement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.justice.vic.gov.au/justice/resources/9bb99c9b-5e06-4276-99f6-52f8c90d284b/brochuredjadjawurrungrecognitionandsettlementagreement.pdf|title=Dja Dja Wurrung Settlement Agreement|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eta Carinae===
In 2010, astronomers Duane Hamacher and David Frew from [[Macquarie University]] in Sydney showed that the Boorong Aboriginal people of northwestern Victoria, Australia, witnessed the outburst of [[Eta Carinae]] in the 1840s and incorporated it into their oral traditions as ''Collowgulloric War'', the wife of ''War'' ([[Canopus]], the Crow&amp;nbsp;– {{ipa|wɑː}}).&lt;ref name="boorong"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only definitive indigenous record of Eta Carinae's outburst identified in the literature to date.

==Astronomical calendars==
Aboriginal calendars tend to be different to European calendars. Many groups in northern Australia use a calendar with six seasons, and some groups mark the seasons by the stars which are visible during them.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt; For the [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]], for example, the rising of the Pleiades at dawn (in May) marks the start of winter.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clarke03"&gt;Clarke (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many stories exist where the [[heliacal rising]] or setting of stars or constellations are used to tell [[Aboriginal Australians]] when it's time to move to a new place and/or look for a new food source.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt;

The [[Boorong]] people in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] know that when the [[Malleefowl]] constellation ([[Lyra]]) disappears in October, to "sit with the Sun", it's time to start gathering her eggs on Earth. Other groups know that when [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] first appears in the sky, the [[dingo]] puppies are about to be born.&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt; When [[Scorpius]] appears, the Yolngu know that the [[Makassar|Macassan]] fisherman would soon arrive to fish for [[Holothuroidea|trepang]].&lt;ref name="csiro"/&gt;

It is not known to what extent Aboriginal people were interested in the precise motion of the Sun, Moon, planets or stars. However, it has been suggested that some of the [[stone arrangements]] in Victoria such as [[Wurdi Youang]] near [[Little River, Victoria]] may have been used to track the [[equinox]]es and/or [[solstice]]s. The arrangement is aligned with the setting sun at the solstices and equinox, but the age is currently unknown.&lt;ref name="wyr"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/ancient-aboriginal-eyes-were-on-the-skies/story-fn5fsgyc-1226000523978 |title=Wurdi Youang rocks could prove Aborigines were first astronomers |author=Andrew Carswell and Robert Cockburn |accessdate=14 March 2011 |date=5 February 2011 |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also rock engravings by the [[Nganguraku]] people at [[Ngaut Ngaut]] which, according to oral tradition, represent lunar cycles. Unfortunately, most of the Nganguraku culture (including their language) has been lost because of the banning of such things by Christian [[missionary|missionaries]] over a hundred years ago.&lt;ref name="csiro"&gt;''[http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/AboriginalAstronomy/ Australian Aboriginal Astronomy] at the [[CSIRO]] site. Accessed on 2009-08-02.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contemporary culture==
A great deal of contemporary Aboriginal art has an astronomical theme, reflecting the astronomical elements of the artists' cultures. Prominent examples are [[Gulumbu Yunupingu]], [[Bill Yidumduma Harney]], and [[Nami Maymuru]], all of whom have won awards or been finalists in the [[Telstra Indigenous Art Awards]]. In 2009 an exhibition of Indigenous Astronomical Art from [[Western Australia|WA]], named Ilgarijiri was launched at [[AIATSIS]] in [[Canberra]] in conjunction with a Symposium on Aboriginal Astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/research/symposia/astronomy09.html 'Things belonging to the sky': a symposium on Indigenous Astronomy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112040428/http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/research/symposia/astronomy09.html |date=12 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other contemporary painters include the daughters of the late [[Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri]], who have the seven sisters as one of their [[Dreaming (spirituality)|Dreaming]]s. Gabriella Possum and Michelle Possum paint the Seven Sisters Dreaming in their paintings. They inherited this Dreaming through their maternal line.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3322">[[Image:Parsley Curled.jpg|right|thumb|[[Parsley]] is a common example of a biennial plant.]]

A '''biennial plant''' is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its biological lifecycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/wildseed/growing/annual.html |title=Annual, Perennial, Biennial? |work=Texas Cooperative Extension |accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biennial |work=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/biennial |access-date=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year, the plant grows leaves, stems, and roots (vegetative structures), then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months. Usually the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground, forming a rosette. Many biennials require a cold treatment, or [[vernalization]], before they will flower. During the next [[spring (season)|spring]] or [[summer (season)|summer]], the stem of the biennial plant elongates greatly, or "bolts".&lt;ref name=RHSbolting&gt;{{cite web |title=Bolting in vegetables |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=262 |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant then flowers, producing [[fruit]]s and [[seed]]s before it finally dies. There are far fewer biennials than either [[perennial plant]]s or [[annual plant]]s.

Under extreme climatic conditions, a biennial plant may complete its life cycle rapidly (e.g., in three months instead of two years). This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were vernalized before they were planted in the ground. This behavior leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas. Conversely, an annual grown under extremely favorable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation, giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial. Some short-lived perennials may appear to be biennial rather than perennial. True biennials flower only once, while many perennials will flower every year once mature.

[[Image:Spring Flowers.JPG|thumb|The Sweet William Dwarf plant is a biennial plant.]]

From a gardener's perspective, a plant's status as annual, biennial, or perennial often varies based on location or purpose. Biennials grown for flowers, fruits, or seeds need to be grown for two years. Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown for just one year (and not grown on a second year to run to seed).

Examples of biennial plants are members of the [[onion]] family including [[leek]],&lt;ref name=RHSbolting/&gt; some members of the [[cabbage]] family,&lt;ref name=RHSbolting/&gt; [[Verbascum thapsus|common mullein]], [[parsley]], fennel,&lt;ref name=RHSbolting/&gt; ''[[Lunaria]]'', [[silverbeet]], [[Rudbeckia hirta|Black-eyed Susan]], [[Sweet William]], [[Aletris|colic weed]], [[carrot]],&lt;ref name=RHSbolting/&gt; and some [[hollyhock]]s. Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed, for example, [[foxglove]] and [[Matthiola incana|stock]].

Although currently a [[Theravada]] Buddhism flourishing country, the [[Mahayana]] cult of worshipping '''Bodhisattva statues''' has existed in ancient [[Sri Lanka]].

==History==
During the middle [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]], [[Bodhisattva]] cult became very popular in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ranjith Hewage|title=විස්මිත අතීත උරුමයන්|publisher=Susara Publishers |date=2012 |chapter=වෙහෙරගල අව‍ලෝකිතේශ්වර බෝධිසත්ත්ව මූර්තිය|isbn=9789556761658}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early period, [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Buddhism]] was predominantly flourished with [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravāda]] Buddhist ideas. Later, [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] aspects were developed. In the [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, [[Bodhisattva]]s were worshipped with a major significance. During the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]] it is mentioned that, [[Mahasena of Anuradhapura|King Mahāsēna]] had built Bodhisattva images.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also [[Dhatusena of Anuradhapura|King Dhatusena]] (459–477 CE) had built a statue of [[Maitreya]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nandadeva Wijesekara|title=පැරණි සිංහල ප්‍රතිමා ශිල්පය|publisher=M.

During 7th–10th centuries AD, [[Mahayana]] Buddhism had spread along the [[Sri Lanka]]n territory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is evidenced by many surviving Bodhisattva statues and carvings belonging to the period. It is mentioned that King [[Dappula I of Anuradhapura]] had built a 15 cubits-high [[Maitreya]] image in [[Ruhuna]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This image is believed to be the recently restored [[Dambegoda Bodhisattva statue]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is an evidence for the strong Maitreya cult in ancient Sri Lanka.

[[Bhuvanaikabahu IV of Gampola|King Bhuwanekabāhu IV]] of [[Kingdom of Gampola|Gampola]] has built Maitreya and [[Natha (Buddhist deity)|Nātha]] (Avalokitesvara) statues in [[Lankatilaka Vihara]]. It is mentioned that King [[Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy|Kirti Sri Rajasinghe]] had built a [[Maitreya]] image in [[Ridi Viharaya]]. ''Dambulu Viahara thudapatha'', a text dated to1780 CE mentions about some Maitreya and Nātha images of the temple. These images can be seen flanking the standing Buddha near the central entrance of [[Dambulla cave temple]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Types== 
Both male and female [[Bodhisattva]] images has found from [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Avalokitesvara]] images play a significant role among the statuary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also various statues of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tārā]], the wife of Avalokitesvara has found. It is assumed that cult of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tārā]] may have been popular in ancient Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ranjith Hewage|title=විස්මිත අතීත උරුමයන්|publisher=Susara Publishers |date=2012 |chapter=තාරා දෙවඟන මූර්තිය|isbn=9789556761658}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of [[Maitreya]] are also common. Statues of Bodhisattvas [[Vajrapani]] and [[Manjushri]] has found in Sri Lanka.

[[Bronze]], stone and [[ivory]] has used as the medium to create Bodhisattva images.

==Examples==

Recombinant human BMPs (rhBMPs) are used in [[orthopedic]] applications such as [[spinal fusion]]s, [[nonunion]]s and oral surgery. rhBMP-2 and rhBMP-7 are [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)-approved for some uses. rhBMP-2 causes more overgrown bone than any other BMPs and is widely used [[off-label]].

==Medical uses==
BMPs for clinical use are produced using [[recombinant DNA]] technology (recombinant human BMPs; rhBMPs).

rhBMPs are used in oral surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medtronic Receives Approval to Market Infuse Bone Graft for Certain Oral Maxillofacial And Dental Regenerative Applications| url=http://wwwp.medtronic.com/Newsroom/NewsReleaseDetails.do?itemId=1173788328615&amp;lang=en_US| accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wikesjö UM, Qahash M, Huang YH, Xiropaidis A, Polimeni G, Susin C | title = Bone morphogenetic proteins for periodontal and alveolar indications; biological observations - clinical implications | journal = Orthodontics &amp; Craniofacial Research | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 263–270  | date = Aug 2009 | pmid = 19627529 | doi = 10.1111/j.1601-6343.2009.01461.x | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122510612/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moghadam HG, Urist MR, Sandor GK, Clokie CM | title = Successful mandibular reconstruction using a BMP bioimplant | journal = The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–127  | date = Mar 2001 | pmid = 11314620 | doi = 10.1097/00001665-200103000-00005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BMP-7 has also recently found use in the treatment of [[chronic kidney disease]] (CKD). BMP-7 has been shown in murine animal models to reverse the loss of [[glomeruli]] due to [[sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]]. Curis has been in the forefront of developing BMP-7 for this use. In 2002, Curis licensed BMP-7 to Ortho Biotech Products, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson.

===Off-label use===
Although rhBMP-2 and rhBMP-7 are used in the treatment of a variety of bone-related conditions including [[spinal fusion]]s and [[nonunion]]s, the risks of this off-label treatment are not understood.&lt;ref name="Ong"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ong KL, Villarraga ML, Lau E, Carreon LY, Kurtz SM, Glassman SD | title = Off-label use of bone morphogenetic proteins in the United States using administrative data | journal = Spine | volume = 35 | issue = 19 | pages = 1794–800  | date = Sep 2010 | pmid = 20700081 | doi = 10.1097/brs.0b013e3181ecf6e4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While rhBMPs are approved for specific applications (spinal lumbar fusions with an anterior approach and tibia nonunions), up to 85% of all BMP usage is [[off-label]].&lt;ref name="Ong"/&gt; rhBMP-2 is used extensively in other lumbar spinal fusion techniques (e.g., using a posterior approach, anterior or posterior [[cervical vertebrae|cervical]] fusions&lt;ref name="Ong"/&gt;).

===Alternative to autograft in long bone nonunions===
In 2001, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved rhBMP-7 (a.k.a. [[Bone morphogenetic protein 7|OP-1]]; [[Stryker Corporation|Stryker Biotech]]) for a [[humanitarian device exemption]] as an alternative to [[autograft]] in long bone nonunions.&lt;ref name="Ong"/&gt; In 2004, the humanitarian device exemption was extended as an alternative to autograft for posterolateral fusion.&lt;ref name="Ong"/&gt; In 2002, rhBMP-2 (Infuse; [[Medtronic]]) was approved for anterior [[lumbar]] interbody fusions (ALIFs) with a lumbar fusion device.&lt;ref name="Ong"/&gt; In 2008 it was approved to repair posterolateral lumbar [[pseudarthrosis]], open [[tibia]] shaft fractures with [[intramedullary nail]] fixation.&lt;ref name="Ong"/&gt; In these products, BMPs are delivered to the site of the fracture by being incorporated into a bone implant, and released gradually to allow bone formation, as the growth stimulation by BMPs must be localized and sustained for some weeks. The BMPs are eluted through a purified [[collagen]] matrix which is implanted in the site of the fracture.&lt;ref name="Even"/&gt; rhBMP-2 helps grow bone better than any other rhBMP so it is much more widely used clinically.&lt;ref name="Even"/&gt; There is "little debate or controversy" about the effectiveness of rhBMP-2 to grow bone to achieve spinal fusions,&lt;ref name="Even"/&gt; and Medtronic generates $700 million in annual sales from their product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/watchdogreports/doctors-didnt-disclose-spine-product-cancer-risk-in-journal-132391068.html |title= Doctors didn't disclose spine product cancer risk in journal |author= John Fauber |newspaper= Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date= 2011-10-22 |accessdate= 2013-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
BMPs interact with specific receptors on the cell surface, referred to as [[bone morphogenetic protein receptors]] (BMPRs).

Signal transduction through BMPRs results in mobilization of members of the [[SMAD (protein)|SMAD]] family of proteins. The signaling pathways involving BMPs, BMPRs and SMADs are important in the development of the heart, central nervous system, and cartilage, as well as post-natal bone development.

They have an important role during embryonic development on the embryonic patterning and early skeletal formation. As such, disruption of BMP signaling can affect the body plan of the developing embryo. For example, [[BMP4]] and its inhibitors [[Noggin (protein)|noggin]] and [[chordin]] help regulate polarity of the embryo (i.e. back to front patterning).  Specifically BMP-4 and its inhibitors play a major role in neurulation and the development of the [[neural plate]].  BMP-4 signals ectoderm cells to develop into skin cells, but the secretion of inhibitors by the underlying mesoderm blocks the action of BMP-4 to allow the ectoderm to continue on its normal course of neural cell development.

As a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, BMP signaling regulates a variety of embryonic patterning during fetal and embryonic development. For example, BMP signaling controls the early formation of the Mullerian duct (MD) which is a tubular structure in early embryonic developmental stage and eventually becomes female reproductive tracts. Chemical inhibiting BMP signals in chicken embryo caused a disruption of MD invagination and blocked the epithelial thickening of the MD-forming region, indicating that the BMP signals play a role in early MD development.&lt;ref&gt;Yuji and Yoshiko (2016). “Early formation of the Mullerian duct is regulated by sequential actions of BMP/Pax2 and FGF/Lim1 signaling”. The Company of Biologists Ltd/ Development. 143, 3549-3559 doi:10.1242/dev.137067.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, BMP signaling is involved in the formation of foregut and hindgut,&lt;ref&gt;Mariana et al,. (2017). “Genomic integration of Wnt/β-catenin and BMP/Smad1 signaling coordinates foregut and hindgut transcriptional programs”. The Company of Biologists Ltd/ Development. 144, 1283-1295 doi:10.1242/dev.145789.&lt;/ref&gt; intestinal villus patterning, and endocardial differentiation. Villi contribute to increase the effective absorption of nutrients by extending the surface area in small intestine. Gain or lose function of BMP signaling altered the patterning of clusters and emergence of villi in mouse intestinal model.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine et al,. (2016). “Villification in the mouse: Bmp signals control intestinal villus patterning”. The Company of Biologists Ltd/ Development. 143, 427-436 doi:10.1242/dev.130112.&lt;/ref&gt; BMP signal derived from myocardium is also involved in endocardial differentiation during heart development. Inhibited BMP signal in zebrafish embryonic model caused strong reduction of endocardial differentiation, but only had little effect in myocardial development.&lt;ref&gt;Sharina et al,. (2015). “Myocardium and BMP signaling are required for endocardial differentiation”. The Company of Biologists Ltd/ Development. 142, 2304-2315 doi:10.1242/dev.118687.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Notch-Wnt-Bmp crosstalk is required for radial patterning during mouse cochlea development via antagonizing manner.&lt;ref&gt;Vidhya et al,. (2016). “Notch-Wnt-Bmp crosstalk regulates radial patterning in the mouse cochlea in a spatiotemporal manner”. The Company of Biologists Ltd/ Development. 143, 4003-4015 doi:10.1242/dev.139469.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutations in BMPs and their inhibitors are associated with a number of human disorders which affect the skeleton.

Several BMPs are also named 'cartilage-derived morphogenetic proteins' (CDMPs), while others are referred to as '[[growth differentiation factor]]s' (GDFs).

==Types==
Originally, seven such proteins were discovered. Of these, six (BMP2 through BMP7) belong to the [[Transforming growth factor beta superfamily]] of proteins. BMP1 is a [[metalloprotease]]. Since then, thirteen more BMPs have been discovered, bringing the total to twenty.&lt;ref name="Even"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Even J, Eskander M, Kang J | title = Bone morphogenetic protein in spine surgery: current and future uses | journal = The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 547–52  | date = Sep 2012 | pmid = 22941797 | doi = 10.5435/JAAOS-20-09-547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From the time of [[Hippocrates]] it has been known that bone has considerable potential for regeneration and repair.  Nicholas Senn, a surgeon at Rush Medical College in Chicago, described the utility of antiseptic decalcified bone implants in the treatment of [[osteomyelitis]] and certain bone deformities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Senn |first=N. |year=1889 |title=On the healing of aseptic bone cavities by implantation of antiseptic decalcified bone |journal=American Journal of the Medical Sciences |volume=98 |issue= 3|pages=219–243 |doi=10.1097/00000441-188909000-00001 |name-list-format=vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Lacroix proposed that there might be a hypothetical substance, osteogenin, that might initiate bone growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lacroix |first=P. |year=1945 |title=Recent investigation on the growth of bone |journal=Nature |volume=156 |issue= 3967|pages=576 |id= |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.1038/156576a0 |name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biological basis of bone morphogenesis was shown by [[Marshall R. Urist]].  Urist made the key discovery that demineralized, [[wikt:Special:Search/lyophilized|lyophilized]] segments of bone induced new bone formation when implanted in muscle pouches in rabbits.  This discovery was published in 1965 by Urist in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Urist MR | title = Bone: formation by autoinduction | journal = Science | volume = 150 | issue = 3698 | pages = 893–899  | date = Nov 1965 | pmid = 5319761 | doi = 10.1126/science.150.3698.893 | authorlink = Marshall R.

Bone induction is a sequential multistep cascade.  The key steps in this cascade are [[chemotaxis]], [[mitosis]], and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]].  Early studies by [[A.

Using a battery of [[bioassay]]s for bone formation, a systematic study was undertaken to isolate and purify putative bone morphogenetic proteins.

A major stumbling block to purification was the insolubility of demineralized bone matrix.  To overcome this hurdle, [[A. Hari Reddi|Hari Reddi]] and Kuber Sampath used dissociative extractants, such as 4M [[guanidinium chloride|guanidine HCL]], 8M [[urea]], or 1% [[sodium dodecyl sulfate|SDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sampath TK, Reddi AH | title = Dissociative extraction and reconstitution of extracellular matrix components involved in local bone differentiation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 78 | issue = 12 | pages = 7599–7603  | date = Dec 1981 | pmid = 6950401 | pmc = 349316 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.78.12.7599 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/78/12/7599.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The soluble extract alone or the insoluble residues alone were incapable of new bone induction.  This work suggested that the optimal osteogenic activity requires a synergy between soluble extract and the insoluble collagenous substratum.  It not only represented a significant advance toward the final purification of bone morphogenetic proteins by the Reddi laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sampath TK, Muthukumaran N, Reddi AH | title = Isolation of osteogenin, an extracellular matrix-associated, bone-inductive protein, by heparin affinity chromatography | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 84 | issue = 20 | pages = 7109–7113  | date = Oct 1987 | pmid = 3478684 | pmc = 299239 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.84.20.7109 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/84/20/7109.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luyten FP, Cunningham NS, Ma S, Muthukumaran N, Hammonds RG, Nevins WB, Woods WI, Reddi AH | title = Purification and partial amino acid sequence of osteogenin, a protein initiating bone differentiation | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 264 | issue = 23 | pages = 13377–13380 | date = Aug 1989 | pmid = 2547759 | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/abstract/264/23/13377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately also enabled the cloning of BMPs by John Wozney and colleagues at Genetics Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wozney JM, Rosen V, Celeste AJ, Mitsock LM, Whitters MJ, Kriz RW, Hewick RM, Wang EA | title = Novel regulators of bone formation: molecular clones and activities | journal = Science | volume = 242 | issue = 4885 | pages = 1528–1534  | date = Dec 1988 | pmid = 3201241 | doi = 10.1126/science.3201241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===
At between [[US$]]6000 and $10,000 for a typical treatment, BMPs can be costly compared with other techniques such as [[bone grafting]]. However, this cost is often far less than the costs required with [[orthopaedic]] revision in multiple surgeries.

While there is little debate that rhBMPs are successful clinically,&lt;ref name="Even"/&gt; there is controversy about their use. It is common for orthopedic surgeons to be paid for their contribution to the development of a new product,&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://dcprogressive.org/2012/12/20/medtronic-accused-of-editing-product-studies-nyse-mdt/ |author= Toi Williams |title= Medtronic Accused Of Editing Product Studies |publisher= DC Progressive |date= 2012-12-20 |accessdate= 2013-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/world-renowned-orthopedic-surgeon-sues-medical-device-company-for-breach-of-contract-187183211.html |author= Rebecca Farbo |title= World-renowned Orthopedic Surgeon Sues Medical Device Company For Breach Of Contract |publisher = PR Newswire |date= 2013-01-16 |accessdate= 2013-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some of the surgeons responsible for the original Medtronic-supported studies on the efficacy of rhBMP-2 have been accused of bias and conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/10/report-reveals-disturbing-details-medtronic-s-role-shaping-infuse-articles |author= Susan Perry |title= Report reveals disturbing details of Medtronic’s role in shaping InFuse articles |publisher= MinnPost |date= 2012-10-26 |accessdate= 2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one surgeon, a lead author on four of these research papers, did not disclose any financial ties while with the company on three of the papers;&lt;ref name="Carreyrou"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303627104576413663395567784 |author= John Carreyrou |author2= Tom McGinty |last-author-amp= yes |title= Medtronic Surgeons Held Back, Study Says |newspaper= The Wall Street Journal |date= 2011-06-29 |accessdate= 2013-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was paid over $4 million by Medtronic.&lt;ref name="Carreyrou"/&gt; In another study, the lead author did not disclose any financial ties to Medtronic; he was paid at least $11 million by the company.&lt;ref name="Carreyrou"/&gt; In a series of 12 publications, the [[median]] financial ties of the authors to Medtronic were $12–16 million.&lt;ref name="Carragee"/&gt; In those studies that had more than 20 and 100 patients, one or more authors had financial ties of $1 million and $10 million, respectively.&lt;ref name="Carragee"/&gt; Early clinical trials using rhBMP-2 underreported [[adverse events]] associated with treatment. In the 13 original industry-sponsored publications related to safety, there were zero adverse events in 780 patients.&lt;ref name="Carragee"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carragee EJ, Hurwitz EL, Weiner BK | title = A critical review of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 trials in spinal surgery: emerging safety concerns and lessons learned | journal = The Spine Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 471–91  | date = Jun 2011 | pmid = 21729796 | doi = 10.1016/j.spinee.2011.04.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been revealed that potential complications can arise from the use including implant displacement, subsidence, [[infection]], urogenital events, and [[retrograde ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="Carreyrou"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carragee"/&gt;

Based on a study conducted by the Department of Family Medicine at the Oregon Health and Science University the use of BMP increased rapidly, from 5.5% of fusion cases in 2003 to 28.1% of fusion cases in 2008. BMP use was greater among patients with previous surgery and among those having complex fusion procedures (combined anterior and posterior approach, or greater than 2 disc levels). Major medical complications, wound complications, and 30-day rehospitalization rates were nearly identical with or without BMP. Reoperation rates were also very similar, even after stratifying by previous surgery or surgical complexity, and after adjusting for demographic and clinical features. On average, adjusted hospital charges for operations involving BMP were about $15,000 more than hospital charges for fusions without BMP, though reimbursement under Medicare's Diagnosis-Related Group system averaged only about $850 more. Significantly fewer patients receiving BMP were discharged to a skilled nursing facility.&lt;ref name=" Spinal Fusion and Bone Morphogenetic Protein "&gt;Spinal Fusion and Bone Morphogenetic Protein&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is a landscape depicting the [[Seine|River Seine]] at [[Argenteuil]] in France. It is owned by Englishman David Joel.

In 2011 ''Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil'' was featured on the British TV programme, ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'', in a failed attempt to establish it as an authentic Monet.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;

==Authenticity==
The painting was acquired by David Joel in 1992 for £40,000.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; Joel is an art historian who has published two art books, the first a [[catalogue raisonné]] of the marine paintings of [[Charles Brooking]], the second a history of Monet at Vétheuil and on the Norman Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Joel, David. ''Charles Brooking, 1723-1759, and the 18th Century British Marine Painters''. Antique Collectors Club, 2000 (published for the National Maritime Museum. It is the earliest Catalogue Raisonne for any English painter, for Hogarth died after Brooking.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Monet&gt;Joel, David. ''Monet at Vétheuil and on the Norman Coast, 1878-1883''. Antique Collectors Club, 2002.(It covers all of Monet's lifetime, with an analysis of his pictures)&lt;/ref&gt; The painting had previously been offered for sale at auction, but failed to reach its £500,000 reserve.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2002680/I-Monet-After-20-year-fight-owner-close-proving-painting-genuine--worth-1-5-million.html |title=Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2011-06-12 |accessdate=2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title ''{{Lang|fr|Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil}}'' along with the date, 1875, appears on the frame, and there is a painted signature of Claude Monet.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; In the years since he purchased it, Joel has attempted to establish it as an authentic Monet.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; The most widely accepted authority on Monet's work is the catalogue raisonné published by the [[Wildenstein Institute]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; The Wildenstein Institute has examined the painting once, after the death of [[Daniel Wildenstein]], and does not accept it as genuine.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; [[Fiona Bruce]] (a journalist) and [[Philip Mould]] (an art dealer and historian) investigated the painting in the TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' first aired on 19 June 2011.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman |first=Len |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13785393 |title=BBC programme preview |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-06-19 |accessdate=2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Access Research Centre scanned the picture using high resolution, [[infrared]] and [[X-ray]] photography.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; At the Lumiere Technology Centre the picture was scanned using a 240-megapixel camera and 13 light filters.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; The resulting image was examined by Iris Schaefer, the head of conservation at the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum in Cologne, who previously uncovered a fake Monet which had been accepted by the Wildenstein Institute. In her opinion, the Joel painting was genuine.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; The chemical analysis of paints used in the painting and signature were studied by Nicholas Eastaugh ([[Courtauld Institute of Art]]) and were found to conform precisely with Monet's palette and the mediums he used in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Joel, David. ''Monet at Vétheuil and on the Norman Coast, 1878-1883''. Antique Collectors Club, 2002, p.190 and p.195&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme had the brushwork and signature examined by experts who concluded that they were by Monet.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; The programme argued that the painting was genuine, an opinion shared by a number of experts,&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; including Monet scholars Professor John House (Courtauld Institute of Art),&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; Professor Paul Hayes Tucker, and others.&lt;ref&gt;The painting was included in "Monet: a Retrospective", curated by Tucker, Katsunori Fukaya, and Katsumi Miyazaki. Copyright by Bridgestone Museum of Art, Tokyo, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However the Wildenstein Institute did not accept their arguments, and maintains that the painting is a fake, based predominantly on the [[Connoisseur#Connoisseurship in Art|connoisseurship]]  of the late [[Daniel Wildenstein]].&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV and Radio |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8581959/Fake-or-Fortune-BBC-One-review.html |title=Telegraph programme review |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only photograph he would have had access to was a small 4&amp;nbsp;cm x 8&amp;nbsp;cm black and white copy in an obituary of Monet, written by René Chavange for ''{{Lang|fr|Le Figaro Artistique}}'' in 1926.&lt;ref name="Figaro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/805/pageone0201.jpg/ |title=Le Figaro Artistique, 16 December 1926, p.149 (Published eight days after Monet's death) |publisher=Imageshack.us |date= |accessdate=2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting was sold by [[Georges Petit]] in 1918 to the Khalil Palace in Cairo, where it stayed until 1953.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt; It is known that Khalil bought a second Monet from Petit at the same time.  This is W1520, ''{{Lang|fr|Le pont aux nymphéas}}'', signed but not dated, which remains in his collection in Cairo. Rodolphe Walter, of the Wildenstein Institute, confirms that all of Petit’s records were destroyed in World War II.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  As such, Daniel Wildenstein would have had no access to a photo of the painting other than the one in ''{{Lang|fr|Le Figaro}}''.

[[File:The reverse of the photograph sent by Petit to Khalil.jpg|thumb|The reverse of the photograph sent by Petit to [[Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil Museum|Khalil]]]]

The Institute has since been provided with further photographs. Daniel Wildenstein was sent a photograph in 1992 by [[Christie's]], which was rejected. After the curator of the Khalil Museum discovered an original photograph sent by Petit to [[Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil]] in 1918 (discussed further below) Guy Wildenstein was informed, but did not change the verdict, relying instead on "connoisseurship".&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;

==Provenance==
The stretcher has a label from the Paris art supplies dealer Latouche who is known to have had dealings with Monet and to have supplied canvases to a number of impressionist artists. The style of this label suggests the canvas was sold before 1884. On the back of the painting there is also a French railway sticker for transport from Paris to Argenteuil where Monet lived between 1871 and 1878.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;
The back of the painting has a further sticker from a London gallery, [[Arthur Tooth &amp; Sons]], which handled a number of Monet paintings. The sticker has the number 3322. Gallery records show that it was acquired from Mahmoud Khalil, an Egyptian art collector whose collection is now housed in the [[Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil Museum]] in Cairo.

The museum records show a large black and white photograph (16&amp;nbsp;cm by 30&amp;nbsp;cm) of the painting, sent by Paris art dealer Georges Petit, who owned the largest gallery in Paris in Rue de Seze.  In June 1889 he mounted the great Monet/Rodin exhibition having persuaded his friend Monet to raise his prices.  He showed 145 paintings, selling most of them.  He remained Monet's second dealer, after Durand Ruel until he died in 1920.  This photograph is the dealer's card, sent to Khalil in Cairo in 1918 and leading to his purchase of the painting. On the reverse of the photograph, in the top left corner, is written the number 5575, followed by "Claude Monet, Les Bords de la Seine a Argenteuil, 42.5x73cm". This number appears also on a label on the reverse of the painting itself (even the handwriting is identical). Stylistically, the label matches others which are known to be from the Georges Petit gallery, and the number implies that it was in Petit’s gallery in 1918, well before Monet’s death in 1926. The funeral was held at Giverny on 8 December, and the obituary was published by ''Le Figaro'' eight days later, illustrated by what appears to be the same photograph.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;

The evidence suggests the following provenance:&lt;ref name=Monet191&gt;Joel, David. ''Monet at Vétheuil and on the Norman Coast, 1878-1883''. p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breed method''' is a laboratory technique used for counting microorganisms in milk. It was introduced in 1910 by American [[biologist]]s [[Samuel Cate Prescott]] and [[Robert Stanley Breed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2543863 | pmid=19599514 | volume=20 | title=The Determination of the Number of Body Cells in Milk by a Direct Method | journal=Am J Public Hygiene | pages=663–4 | last1 = Prescott | first1 = SC | last2 = Breed | first2 = RS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
It is a method for somatic cell count, to know the number of living and dead microorganisms. When the method only recounts living organisms is called "viable count".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crecimiento bacteriano|url=http://www.ramos.utfsm.cl/doc/530/sc/LABORATORIO_3.pdf|access-date=2014-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324172515/http://www.ramos.utfsm.cl/doc/530/sc/LABORATORIO_3.pdf#|archive-date=2014-03-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María.

There are many methods for the quantification of [[microorganism]]s, including microscopy methods, Coulter counter, Mass Spectrometry (for estimating cell mass), and Cell Culture methods which form and grow colonies of bacteria.

The existing security in dairy products is given by the microbiological quality of the same, which ensures consumption from the point of view of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://depa.fquim.unam.mx/amyd/archivero/P7CuantificacionDeMicroorganismos_21746.pdf |title= Cuantificación de microorganismos.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of the quality of raw milk is a common practice in the dairy industry and aims to control the quality of the samples and the material introduced into the processing plant, culminating in a mass-consumption to ensure quality standards.

It is important first, to homogenize milk, heating it in a [[water]] bath at 40&amp;nbsp;°C for somatic cells that float to the surface along with the fat. The laboratory apparatus must be clean but not necessarily [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]], since the method is based on cell count and [[asepsis]] is not accurate. If later it is going to make detailed microbiological analyzes on the same sample,  then it is necessary to be obtained and manipulated with sterile material.

After this process, the sample is transported to the [[laboratory]] in a 4&amp;nbsp;°C conservative container. It can be preserved in these conditions for 24 hours.

For sampling there are two basic conditions to consider:

The first one is to represent the total volume of milk from which it was removed, and the second condition involves to be stored and transported at the correct [[temperature]] so that they see their unmodified source properties, prior to analysis in the laboratory. In case of delay in completion of the analysis a preservative that not alter the subsequent analytical result should be added to the milk.

== Application of the technique ==
Be made extended and 0.01 mL of 1 cm2 on fat-free slides (which are cleaned with xylene).

After allowing to dry, it is colored and performs counting. For this, the [[average]] of existing cells is performed in the field of the microscope, dividing total somatic cells from microscopic factor (MF) which corresponds to the number of fields in one inch, i.e. 100&amp;nbsp;mm, obtaining in this way the number of somatic cells per milliliter of [[milk]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vet.unicen.edu.ar/html/Areas/Inspeccion{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} y Tecnologia de los Alimentos/documentos/2012/Guia_TP_ITA_2012-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

;Microscopic Factor Calculation

&lt;math&gt;
 
MF = {{100 \ mm} \over \acute field \ \ Area \ in \ mm}

&lt;/math&gt;

;Getting the Average:

&lt;math&gt;
 
Number \ of \ somatics \ Cells= {Total \ somatic \ cells\ \over Number\ of \ counted \ fields}

&lt;/math&gt;

'''Calmodulin''' ('''CaM''') is a versatile [[protein]] involved in almost every cellular process, including [[apoptosis]], [[metabolism]], [[smooth muscle]] contraction, learning and [[memory]] formation, [[inflammation]] and [[immune response]]. A wide range of target proteins, or CaM binding targets (CaMBTs) play a key role in regulating those cellular processes through interaction with CaM. Among them, most require the presence of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. As the central part, CaM [[Signal transduction|transduces]] and decodes transient extracellular calcium influxes in various frequencies and amplitudes. Binding of [[calcium]] ions causes large [[conformational change]]s in CaM, which further selectively binds and activates downstream CaM binding target proteins (CaMBTs), in addition to those independent of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="pmid6313166"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stevens FC | title = Calmodulin: an introduction | journal = Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. | volume = 61 | issue = 8 | pages = 906–10 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6313166 | doi = 10.1139/o83-115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Will continue to finish this part of examples of CaMBTs with their functions --&gt;
&lt;!-- The downstream CaMBTs account for diverse cellular functions, e.g.  &lt;ref &gt; http://calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb/ctdb/home.html &lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Mechanism of target binding and recognition==
There are several opinions of the binding mechanism between CaM and CaMBT. The binding between a CaM and a CaMBT involves conformational changes in both. The binding domain of the CaMBTs is usually disordered.  Current research indicates that selective [[Plasma protein binding|protein binding]] occurs through the mechanism of mutually induced conformational fit,&lt;ref name="mutuallyinducedconf"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wang Q | title = Protein Recognition and Selection through Conformational and Mutually Induced Fit | journal =  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 110 | issue = 51 | pages = 20545–50 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1312788110 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would explain how calcium dynamics in CaM would modulate its interaction.

==Experimental and computational methods of studying target binding and recognition==
Current research on CaM signaling and CaM–BT interaction includes experimental kinetic rate observations and coarse grain/all atom [[molecular dynamics]] simulations. Because protein signaling and [[protein–protein interaction]] is a new field of research, many observed interactions cannot be explained through [[experiment]] alone. The unification between simulation and experimental results is necessary to expand the [[predictive power]] of the [[Theory|theoretical approach]] and create general laws that explain the mechanics of signaling/protein–protein interactions.

The computational approach for modeling [[Macromolecule|macro molecules]] is very resource intensive. The Hamiltonian equation in molecular dynamic software relates each [[atom]] to all other atoms in the system through [[Kinetic energy|kinetic]], [[Electrostatics|electrostatic]], [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]], [[dihedral angle]], [[Bond energy|bond]], etc. energies. For example,  calmodulin-binding domain of brain [[Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II|calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha]] [[Peptide|polypeptide]] contains 21 residues and 318 atoms. For a single time step, the molecular dynamics software must perform energy calculations between every atom in the polypeptide, which is ~100,000 calculations. Since the time step must be in the sub picosecond range (to insure stability), several million time steps must be performed to obtain meaningful data.
To remedy the large number of calculations involved in all atom simulations, the coarse grain simulation technique can be used. Current work from the [[biophysics]] group at the [[University of Houston]] uses open source coarse-grained and all atomistic models of CaM and wildtype/mutated binding targets of CaMKII in their research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="990">'''Collaborative engineering''' is defined by the [[International Journal of Collaborative Engineering]] as a discipline that "studies the interactive process of engineering collaboration, whereby multiple interested [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] resolve conflicts, bargain for individual or collective advantages, agree upon courses of action, and/or attempt to craft joint outcomes which serve their mutual interests."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inderscience.com/browse/index.php?journalID=161 International Journal of Collaborative Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative engineering is quickly becoming a topic of great interest in recent years due to the explosion of internet technologies. This upsurge is partially due to the success of projects such as [[Wikipedia]] and [[Linux]] that have proven the efficacy of internet collaboration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6289">'''Conversational interfaces''' (CUI) are platforms that mimic a conversation with a real human. Historically, computers have relied on graphical user interfaces (GUI) such as the user pressing a “back” button to translate the user’s desired action into commands the computer understands. While an effective mechanism of completing computing actions, there is a learning curve for the user associated with GUI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Conversational Interfaces: Where Are We Today? Where Are We Heading? | website=Smashing Magazine | url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/conversational-interfaces-where-are-we-today-where-are-we-heading/ | ref={{sfnref | Smashing Magazine}} | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, CUI’s provide opportunity for the user to communicate with the computer in their natural language rather than in a syntax specific commands. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Brownlee | first=John | title=Conversational Interfaces, Explained | website=Co.Design | date=2016-04-04 | url=https://www.fastcodesign.com/3058546/conversational-interfaces-explained | ref=harv | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To do this, conversational interfaces use [[Natural_language_processing|Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) to allow computers to understand, analyze and create meaning from human language. Unlike word processors, NLP considers the structure to human language (i.e. Words make a phrase, phrases make sentences which convey the idea or intent the user is trying to invoke). The ambiguous nature of human language makes it difficult for a machine to always correctly interpret the user’s requests, which is why we have seen a shift towards [[Natural_language_understanding|Natural Language Understanding]] (NLU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Pan | first=Jiaqi | title=Conversational Interfaces: The Future of Chatbots – Chatbots Magazine | website=Chatbots Magazine | date=2017-08-25 | url=https://chatbotsmagazine.com/conversational-interfaces-the-future-of-chatbots-18975a91fe5a | ref=harv | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

NLU allows for [[sentiment analysis]] and conversational searches which allows a line of questioning to continue, with the context carried throughout the conversation. NLU allows conversational interfaces to handle unstructured inputs that the human brain is able to understand such as spelling mistakes of follow-up questions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Lola | title=NLP vs. NLU: What’s the Difference? – Lola – Medium | website=Medium | date=2016-10-05 | url=https://medium.com/@lolatravel/nlp-vs-nlu-whats-the-difference-d91c06780992 | ref=harv | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   For example, through leveraging NLU, a user could first ask for the population of the United States. If the user then asks “Who is the president”, the search will carry forward the context of the United States and provide the appropriate response.

Conversational interfaces have emerged as a tool for businesses to efficiently provide consumers with relevant information, in a cost effective manner. CUI provide ease of access to relevant, contextual information to the end user without the complexities and learning curve typically associated with technology.

While there are a variety of interface brands, to date, there are two main categories of conversational interfaces; [[Voice_command_device|voice assistants]] and [[Chatbot|chatbots]].

==Voice Assistants==

[[Voice assistant]]s are interfaces that allow a user to complete an action simply by speaking a command. Introduced in October 2011, Apple’s [[Siri]] was one of the first voice assistants widely adopted. Siri allowed users of iPhone to get information and complete actions on their device simply by asking Siri.
 
Further development has continued since Siri’s introduction to include home based devices such as [[Google_Home|Google Home]] or [[Amazon_Echo|Amazon Echo]] (powered by Alexa) that allow users to “connect” their homes through a series of smart devices to further the options of tangible actions they can complete. Users can now turn off the lights, set reminders and call their friends all with a verbal queue. 

These conversational interfaces that utilize a voice assistant have become an efficient and popular way for businesses to interact with their customers as the interface removes the typical friction in a customer journey. Customers no longer need to remember a long list of usernames and passwords to their various accounts; they simply link each account to Google or Amazon once, and gone are the days where you needed to wait on hold for an hour to ask a simple question. 

==Chatbots==

[[Chatbot]]s are web or mobile based interfaces that allow the user to ask questions and retrieve information. This information can be generic in nature such as the Google Assistant chat window that allows for internet searches, or it can be a specific brand or service which allows the user to gain information about the status of their various accounts. Their backend systems work in the same manner as a voice assistant, with the front end utilizing a visual interface to convey information. This visual interface can be beneficial for companies that need to do more complex business transactions with customers, as instructions, deep links and graphics can all be utilized to convey an answer. The complexity to which a chatbot answers questions depends on the development of the back end. Chatbots with hard-coded answers has a smaller base on information and corresponding skills. Chatbots that leverage machine learning will continue to grow and develop larger content bases for more complex responses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Onlim | title=How do Chatbots Work? – Chatbots Life | website=Chatbots Life | date=2017-03-22 | url=https://chatbotslife.com/how-do-chatbots-work-fe49ef32598f | ref=harv | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

More frequently, companies are leveraging chatbots as a way to offload simple questions and transactions from human agents. These chatbots provide the option to assist a user, but then directly transfer the customer to a live agent within the same chat window if the conversation becomes too complex.

In [[applied mathematics]], a '''damping matrix''' is a matrix corresponding to any of certain systems of linear ordinary differential equations.  

A '''damping [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]''' is defined as follows.  If the system has ''n'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and is under application of ''m'' [[damping]] [[force]]s.

Each [[force]] can be expressed as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;f_{Di}=c_{i1} \dot{u_1}+c_{i2} \dot{u_2}+\cdots+c_{in} \dot{u_n}=\sum_{j=1}^n c_{i,j}\dot{u_j} &lt;/math&gt;

It yields in [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form;

: &lt;math&gt;F_D=C \dot{U} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''C is the [[damping]] matrix''' composed by the damping coefficients:

: &lt;math&gt;C=(c_{i,j})_{1\le i\le n,1\le j\le m} &lt;/math&gt;

The other German states adopted it in the following years. In contrast to the other historic doctoral degrees (e.g. ''Dr. phil.'', ''Dr. jur.'' or ''Dr. med.''), the Doktoringenieur was not titled in Latin but German, and therefore written with dash (Dr.-Ing.).

In the field of mathematics, computer science and natural sciences, some universities offer the choice between ''Dr.-Ing.'' and ''Dr. rer. nat.'' based on the primary focus of the dissertation.

'''Ecodesign''' is an approach to designing products with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its whole lifecycle.  In a [[life cycle assessment]], the life cycle of a product is usually divided into procurement, manufacture, use, and disposal.

Ecodesign is a growing responsibility and understanding of our [[ecological footprint]] on the planet. Green awareness, [[overpopulation]], [[industrialization]] and an increased environmental population have led to the questioning of consumer values. It is imperative to search for new building solutions that are [[environmentally friendly]] and lead to a reduction in the consumption of materials and [[energy consumption|energy]].

==Overview==
[[File:Stainless Steel Talbe with FSC Eucalyptus wood Ecodesign.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Stainless steel]] table with [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]] Teca wood - [[Brazil]] ecodesign]]
As the whole product's life cycle should be regarded in an integrated perspective, representatives from advance development, design, production, marketing, purchasing, and project management should work together on the Ecodesign of a further developed or new product.  Together, they have the best chance to predict the holistic effects of changes of the product and their environmental impact.

An eco-design product has a [[cradle-to-cradle]] life cycle ensuring zero waste is created in the whole process. By mimicking life cycles in nature, eco-design is a fundamental concept in achieving a truly [[circular economy]].

Environmental aspects which ought to be analysed for every stage of the life cycle are:

* Consumption of resources (energy, materials, water or land area)
* Emissions to air, water, and the ground (our Earth) as being relevant for the environment and human health
* Miscellaneous (e.g. noise and vibration)

Waste (hazardous waste and other waste defined in environmental legislation) is only an intermediate step and the final emissions to the environment (e.g. methane and leaching from landfills) are inventoried. All consumables, materials and parts used in the life cycle phases are accounted for, and all indirect environmental aspects linked to their production.

The environmental aspects of the phases of the life cycle are evaluated according to their environmental impact on the basis of a number of parameters, such as extent of environmental impact, potential for improvement, or potential of change.

According to this ranking the recommended changes are carried out and reviewed after a certain time.

==Environmental effect analysis==
[[File:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|350px|An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Interior design|decoration]] [[fair]]. The reuse of materials is a sustainable practice that is rapidly growing among [[designers]] in [[Brazil]].]]

One instrument to identify the factors that are important for the reduction of the environmental impact during all lifecycle stages is the environmental effect analysis (EEA).

For an EEA the following are taken into account:

* Customers' wishes
* Legal requirements, market requirements (competitors)
* Data concerning the product and the manufacturing process

==Applications in design==
Ecodesign concepts currently have a great influence on many aspects of design; the impact of [[global warming]] and an increase in CO₂ emissions have led companies to consider a more environmentally conscious approach to their design thinking and process.
In building design and construction, designers are taking on the concept of Ecodesign throughout the design process, from the choice of materials to the type of energy that is being consumed and the disposal of waste.

With respect to these concepts, [[online]] platforms dealing in only Ecodesign products are emerging, with the additional sustainable purpose of eliminating all unnecessary distribution steps between the designer and the final customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://nupe.co.uk/an-interview-with-sustainable-design-company-moorbi/ Kamran Assadi for Nupè April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoMaterials''', such as the use of local raw materials, are less costly and reduce the environmental costs of shipping, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions generated from transportation. Certified green building materials, such as wood from sustainably managed forest plantations, with accreditations from companies such as the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), or the Pan-European Forest Certification Council (PEFCC), can be used.

Several other types of components and materials can be used in sustainable buildings. Recyclable and recycled materials are commonly used in construction, but it is important that they don’t generate any waste during manufacture or after their life cycle ends. Reclaimed materials such as timber at a construction site or junkyard can be given a second life by reusing them as support beams in a new building or as furniture. Stones from an excavation can be used in a retaining wall. The reuse of these items means that less energy is consumed in making new products and a new natural aesthetic quality is achieved.

'''[[Water recycling]]''' systems such as rainwater tanks that harvest water for multiple purposes. Reusing [[grey water]] generated by households are a useful way of not wasting drinking water.

'''Off-grid homes''' only use clean electric power. They are completely separated and disconnected from the conventional electricity grid and receive their power supply by harnessing active or passive energy systems.

==Active system==
These systems use the principle of harnessing the power generated from renewable and inexhaustible sources of energy, for example; solar, wind, thermal, biomass, and geothermal energy.

'''[[Solar power]]''' is a widely known and used renewable energy source. An increase in technology has allowed solar power to be used in a wide variety of applications. Two types of solar panels generate heat into electricity. Thermal solar panels reduce or eliminate the consumption of gas and diesel, and reduce CO₂ emissions. Photovoltaic panels convert solar radiation into an electric current which can power any appliance. However, this is a more complex technology and is generally more expensive to manufacture than thermal panels.

'''[[Biomass]]''' is the energy source created from organic materials generated through a forced or spontaneous biological process.

'''[[Geothermal energy]]''' is obtained by harnessing heat from the ground. This type of energy can be used to heat and cool homes. It eliminates dependence on external energy and generates minimum waste. It is also hidden from view as it is placed underground, making it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to incorporate in a design.

'''Wind turbines''' are a useful application for areas without immediate conventional power sources, e.g., rural areas with schools and hospitals that need more power. Wind turbines can provide up to 30% of the energy consumed by a household but they are subject to regulations and technical specifications, such as the maximum distance at which the facility is located from the place of consumption and the power required and permitted for each property.

==Passive systems==
Buildings that integrate passive energy systems ([[bioclimatic buildings]]) are heated using non-mechanical methods, thereby optimizing natural resources. The use of optimal daylight plays an integral role in passive energy systems. This involves the positioning and location of a building to allow and make use of sunlight throughout the whole year. By using the sun's rays, thermal mass is stored into the building materials such as concrete and can generate enough heat for a room.

A '''[[green roof]]''' is a roof partially or completely covered with plants or other vegetation. This creates insulation that helps regulate the building's temperature. It also retains water, providing a water recycling system. It also provides soundproofing.

==In art and decorating==
Recycling has been used in art since the early part of the 20th century, when cubist artist [[Pablo Picasso]] (1881–1973) and [[Georges Braque]] (1882–1963) created collages from newsprints, packaging and other found materials. The "Outside Art" movement is recognized as a genuine expressive art form, and is celebrated because of the materials used and not in spite of them.  The same principle can be used inside the home, where found objects are now displayed with pride and collecting certain objects and materials to furnish a home is now admired rather than looked down upon.

There is a huge demand in Western countries to decorate homes in a "green" style. A lot of effort is placed into recycled product design and the creation of a natural look. This ideal is also a part of developing countries, although their use of recycled and natural products is often based in necessity and wanting to get maximum use out of materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8435">In [[statistical mechanics]], the '''eight-vertex model''' is a generalisation of the [[ice-type model|ice-type (six-vertex) models]]; it was discussed by Sutherland,&lt;ref&gt;B. Sutherland, J. Math. Phys. '''11''', 3183 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; and Fan &amp; Wu,&lt;ref&gt;C. Fan and F. Y. Wu, Phys. Rev. B '''2''', 723 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; and solved by [[Rodney Baxter|Baxter]] in the zero-field case.&lt;ref&gt;R. Baxter, Physical Review Letters '''26''', 832 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

As with the ice-type models, the eight-vertex model is a square [[lattice (group)|lattice model]], where each state is a configuration of arrows at a vertex. The allowed vertices have an even number of arrows pointing towards the vertex; these include the six inherited from the [[ice-type model]] (1-6), and sinks and sources (7, 8).

[[File:Eightvertex2.png|thumb|Eightvertex2]]

We consider a &lt;math&gt;N\times N&lt;/math&gt; lattice, with &lt;math&gt;N^2&lt;/math&gt; vertices and &lt;math&gt;2N^2&lt;/math&gt; edges. Imposing periodic boundary conditions requires that the states 7 and 8 occur equally often, as do states 5 and 6, and thus can be taken to have the same energy. For the zero-field case the same is true for the two other pairs of states. Each vertex &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; has an associated energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_j&lt;/math&gt; and [[Boltzmann factor|Boltzmann weight]] &lt;math&gt;w_j=e^{-\frac{\epsilon_j}{kT}}&lt;/math&gt;, giving the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] over the lattice as
:&lt;math&gt;
Z=\sum \exp\left(-\frac{\sum_j n_j\epsilon_j}{kT}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where the summation is over all allowed configurations of vertices in the lattice. In this general form the partition function remains unsolved.

==Solution in the zero-field case==

The zero-field case of the model corresponds physically to the absence of external electric fields. Hence, the model remains unchanged under the reversal of all arrows; the states 1 and 2, and 3 and 4, consequently must occur as pairs. The vertices can be assigned arbitrary weights 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
w_1=w_2&amp;=a\\
w_3=w_4&amp;=b\\
w_5=w_6&amp;=c\\
w_7=w_8&amp;=d.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The solution is based on the observation that rows in [[transfer matrix method|transfer matrices]] commute, for a certain parametrisation of these four Boltzmann weights. This came about as a modification of an alternate solution for the [[six-vertex model]]; it makes use of [[Jacobi theta function|elliptic theta functions]].

===Commuting transfer matrices===

The proof relies on the fact that when &lt;math&gt; \Delta'=\Delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Gamma'=\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, for quantities 
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\Delta&amp;=\frac{a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2}{2(ab+cd)}\\
\Gamma&amp;=\frac{ab-cd}{ab+cd}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
the transfer matrices &lt;math&gt; T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; (associated with the weights &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d'&lt;/math&gt;) commute. Using the [[star-triangle relation]], Baxter reformulated this condition as equivalent to a parametrisation of the weights given as
:&lt;math&gt;
a:b:c:d=\operatorname{snh}(\eta-u):\operatorname{snh} (\eta +u):\operatorname{snh} (2\eta): k\operatorname{snh} (2\eta)\operatorname{snh} (\eta-u)\operatorname{snh} (\eta+u)
&lt;/math&gt;
for fixed modulus &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; and variable &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. Here snh is the hyperbolic analogue of sn, given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname {snh} (u) &amp;=-i\operatorname {snh} (iu) \\
\text{where } \operatorname {snh} (u)&amp;= \frac{H(u)}{k^{1/2}\Theta(u)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;H(u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Theta(u)&lt;/math&gt; are [[Jacobi elliptic functions]] of modulus &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The associated transfer matrix &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; thus is a function of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; alone; for all &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
T(u)T(v)=T(v)T(u).
&lt;/math&gt;

===The matrix function &lt;math&gt;Q(u)&lt;/math&gt;===

The other crucial part of the solution is the existence of a nonsingular matrix-valued function &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, such that for all complex &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; the matrices &lt;math&gt;Q(u), Q(u')&lt;/math&gt; commute with each other and the transfer matrices, and satisfy
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \zeta(u)T(u)Q(u)=\phi(u-\eta)Q(u+2\eta)+\phi(u+\eta)Q(u-2\eta)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
where
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\zeta(u)&amp;=[c^{-1}H(2\eta)\Theta(u-\eta)\Theta(u+\eta)]^N\\
\phi(u)&amp;=[\Theta(0)H(u)\Theta(u)]^N.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The existence and commutation relations of such a function are demonstrated by considering pair propagations through a vertex, and periodicity relations of the theta functions, in a similar way to the six-vertex model.

===Explicit solution===

The commutation of matrices in ({{EquationNote|1}}) allow them to be [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalised]], and thus [[eigenvalues]] can be found. The partition function is calculated from the maximal eigenvalue, resulting in a [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] per site of  
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f=\epsilon_5-2kT\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sinh^2((\tau-\lambda)n)(\cosh(n\lambda)-\cosh(n\alpha))}{n\sinh(2n\tau)\cosh(n\lambda)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
for
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\tau&amp;=\frac{\pi K'}{2K}\\
\lambda&amp;=\frac{\pi \eta}{iK}\\
\alpha&amp;=\frac{\pi u}{iK}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt; are the complete elliptic integrals of moduli &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k'&lt;/math&gt;.
The eight vertex model was also solved in [[quasicrystals]].

==Equivalence with an Ising model==

There is a natural correspondence between the eight-vertex model, and the [[Ising model]] with 2-spin and 4-spin nearest neighbour interactions. The states of this model are spins &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\pm 1&lt;/math&gt; on faces of a square lattice. The analogue of 'edges' in the eight-vertex model are products of spins on adjacent faces:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\alpha_{ij}&amp;=\sigma_{ij}\sigma_{i,j+1}\\
\mu_{ij}&amp;=\sigma_{ij}\sigma_{i+1,j}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Isingduallattice.png|Isingduallattice]]

The most general form of the energy for this model is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\epsilon&amp;=-\sum_{ij}(J_h\mu_{ij}+J_v\alpha_{ij}+J\alpha_{ij}\mu_{ij}+J'\alpha_{i+1,j}\mu_{ij}+J''\alpha_{ij}\alpha_{i+1,j})
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;J_h&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J_v&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J'&lt;/math&gt; describe the horizontal, vertical and two diagonal 2-spin interactions, and &lt;math&gt;J''&lt;/math&gt; describes the 4-spin interaction between four faces at a vertex; the sum is over the whole lattice.

[[File:Isinginteractions.png|Isinginteractions]]

We denote horizontal and vertical spins (arrows on edges) in the eight-vertex model &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; respectively, and define up and right as positive directions. The restriction on vertex states is that the product of four edges at a vertex is 1; this automatically holds for Ising 'edges'. Each &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; configuration then corresponds to a unique  &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; configuration, whereas each  &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; configuration gives two choices of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; configurations.

Equating general forms of Boltzmann weights for each vertex &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, the following relations between the &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_h&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J_v&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J''&lt;/math&gt; define the correspondence between the lattice models:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\epsilon_1&amp;=-J_h-J_v-J-J'-J'',\quad \epsilon_2=J_h+J_v-J-J'-J''\\
\epsilon_3&amp;=-J_h+J_v+J+J'-J'',\quad \epsilon_2=J_h-J_v+J+J'-J''\\
\epsilon_5&amp;=\epsilon_6=J-J'+J''\\
\epsilon_7&amp;=\epsilon_8=-J+J'+J''.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that in the zero-field case of the eight-vertex model, the horizontal and vertical interactions in the corresponding Ising model vanish.

These relations gives the equivalence &lt;math&gt;Z_I=2Z_{8V}&lt;/math&gt; between the partition functions of the eight-vertex model, and the 2,4-spin Ising model. Consequently a solution in either model would lead immediately to a solution in the other.

The '''''Ethiopic Collectio Monastica''''' is a book that includes some original sayings of the [[Desert Fathers]], and which is textually independent of the more well known ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'' (''Sayings of the Desert Fathers''). It was first published by Victor Arras in 1963, based on two separate manuscripts that were likely based on Greek or Coptic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arras|first=Victor|title=Collectio monastica: Ethiopic text|year=1963|publisher=Secrétariat du CorpusSCO|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Collectio_monastica.html?id=D_A2cgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmless2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harmless, William  |year=2000 |title=Remembering Poemen Remembering: The Desert Fathers and the Spirituality of Memory |journal=Church History |publisher=American Society of Church History |volume=15 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66380509.html}}&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection consists of sixty-eight chapter of widely different lengths. Included in the book are collections of Desert Father sayings, most of which have no parallel in the ''Apophthegmata Patrum''. The original work appears to have been written by a 5th-century monk who either lived with the Desert Fathers at [[Scetis]], or knew the monks who lived there. He also appears to have known [[Abba Poemen]], because of several unique stories and sayings attributed to him.&lt;ref name="Harmless2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harmless, William |title=Desert Christians: an introduction to the literature of early monasticism |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=Appendix 8.5|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2004|isbn=0-19-516222-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIM0pWejvBgC&amp;pg=PT504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3888">The '''Flood Studies Report''', published in 1975, is used in relation to [[rainfall]] events in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/5964/1/IH_094.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been replaced by the '''Flood Estimation Handbook''', but the method can still be used.

==Calculation procedure==

[[File:Rain over Woodhead Reservoir, Derbyshire.jpg|thumb|alt=Rainfall in the UK.|Rainfall on a rural catchment in [[Longdendale]], [[Derbyshire]].]]

It is possible to use the FSR to predict the depth of rainfall from a storm of a given duration and return period. The FSR includes values for two key variables mapped across the UK: the M5-60 minutes rainfall, and the ratio "r".
*M5-60 minutes rainfall is the expected depth of rainfall in millimetres (mm) from a storm lasting 60 minutes (1 hour) with a return period of 5 years (hence M5).
*M5-2 days rainfall is the expected depth of rainfall from a storm lasting 2 days (48 hours) with a return period of 5 years.
*The dimensionless ratio "r" is the M5-60 minutes value divided by the M5-2 days value.
*Factor Z1 is interpolated from figures&lt;ref&gt;Design and analysis of urban storm drainage - The Wallingford Procedure, Volume 4, The Modified Rational Method, {{ISBN|0 946466 041}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the values of M5-2 days and "r".
*Factor Z2 (the growth factor) is found from the M5 rainfall depth, and depends on the return period.
*The Areal Reduction Factor (ARF) takes the catchment area into account. For small catchments (below 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) the ARF is not required.

To find the depth of a rainfall of duration D and return period T at a given location in the UK, the following should be carried out:
# Find M5-60 minutes rainfall depth and "r" for the location using FSR maps.
# Divide this rainfall depth by "r" to get the M5-2 days depth.
# Multiply the M5-2 days depth by factor Z1 to find the M5-D depth.
# Multiply the M5-D depth by factor Z2 (the growth factor) to find the MT-D depth.
# Multiply the MT-D depth by the Areal Reduction Factor (ARF).

===Example===
Find the depth of rainfall from a storm of duration 6 hours and return period 10 years on a catchment of 5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in [[Sheffield]].
#From the FSR maps, the M5-60 minutes rainfall is 20.5mm, and "r" = 0.4.
#Divide 20.5mm by 0.4 to get 51.3mm, which is the M5-2 days rainfall depth.
#Factor Z1 = 0.64, so multiply 51.3mm by 0.64 to get 32.8mm.
#Factor Z2 = 1.16, so multiply 32.8mm by 1.16 to get 38.1mm.
#The ARF is 0.96, so multiply 38.1mm by 0.96 to get 36.6mm.

Therefore the expected depth of rainfall from the storm is 36.6mm. The mean intensity of rainfall is given by 36.6mm divided by 6 hours, which is 6.1mm/hour.

===Storm profiles===
The above method is sufficient for finding the overall depth of rainfall during a storm. However, it is often useful from an engineering perspective to predict the intensity of rainfall during the storm, to allow structures such as drains and sewers to be designed with sufficient capacity for stormwater.

In general, the intensity of a storm is highest at the mid-duration point (known as the peak), and lowest at the start and end of the storm. Therefore, peaked profiles are applied to the storm data to provide a more realistic description of the rainfall intensity during the storm.

==Flood Estimation Handbook==
The '''Flood Estimation Handbook''' was published in 1999 and replaces the FSR.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceh.ac.uk/feh2/fehintro.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the percentage runoff equation:

&lt;math&gt; PR = 0.829PIMP + 25SOIL + 0.078UCWI - 20.7 &lt;/math&gt;

where PR is percentage runoff, PIMP is percentage [[impervious surface|imperviousness]] of the catchment, SOIL is the soil index and UCWI is urban catchment wetness index.

'''Forward anonymity''', analogous to [[forward secrecy]], in [[computer security]] and [[cryptography]] is the property which prevents an attacker who has recorded past communications from discovering the identities of the participants, even after the fact.

When speaking of forward secrecy, system designers attempt to prevent an attacker who has recorded past communications from discovering the contents of said communications later on. One example of a system which satisfies the perfect forward secrecy property is one in which a compromise of one key by an attacker (and consequent [[decryption]] of messages encrypted with that key) does not undermine the security of previously used keys. Forward secrecy does not refer to protecting the content of the message, but rather to the protection of keys used to decrypt messages.

One example of a system which uses forward anonymity is a [[public key cryptography]] system, where the public key is well-known and used to [[encrypt]] a message, and an unknown private key is used to decrypt it. In this system, one of the keys is always said to be compromised, but messages and their participants are still unknown by anyone without the corresponding private key.

==History==
Originally introduced by  [[Whitfield Diffie]], [[Paul van Oorschot]], and Michael James Wiener to describe a property of STS ([[station-to-station protocol]]) involving a long term secret, either a private key or a shared password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diffie |first1=Whitfield |last2=Van Oorschot |first2=Paul C. |last3=Wiener |first3=Michael J. |title=Authentication and authenticated key exchanges |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |date=June 1992 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=107–125 |doi=10.1007/BF00124891 |url=http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/papers/sts-final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Key Cryptography==
Public Key Cryptography is a common form of a forward anonymous system. It is used to pass encrypted messages, preventing any information about the message from being discovered if the message is intercepted by an attacker. It uses two keys, a public key and a private key. The public key is published, and is used by anyone to encrypt a [[plaintext]] message. The Private key is not well known, and is used to decrypt [[cyphertext]]. Public key cryptography is known as an asymmetric decryption algorithm because of different keys being used to perform opposing functions. Public key cryptography is popular because, while it is computationally easy to create a pair of keys, it is extremely difficult to determine the private key knowing only the public key. Therefore, the public key being well known does not allow messages which are intercepted to be decrypted. This is a forward anonymous system because one compromised key (the public key) does not compromise the anonymity of the system.

==Web of Trust==
A variation of the public key cryptography system is a [[Web of trust]], where each user has both a public and private key. Messages sent are encrypted using the intended recipient's public key, and only this recipient's private key will decrypt the message. They are also signed with the senders private key. This creates added security where it becomes more difficult for an attacker to pretend to be a user, as the lack of a private key signature indicates a non-trusted user.

==Limitations==
A forward anonymous system does not necessarily mean a wholly secure system. A successful [[cryptanalysis]] of a message or sequence of messages can still decode the information without the use of a private key or long term secret.

==News==
Forward anonymity, along with other cryptography related properties, received a burst of media attention after the leak of classified information by [[Edward Snowden]], beginning in June, 2013, which indicated that the [[NSA]] and [[FBI]] had practices of asking companies to leave in back doors for them, allowing the companies and agencies to decrypt information stored on phones and other devices more easily, with the intention of allowing them to more easily find and arrest various criminals, while occasionally mistakenly targeting innocent civilians. They especially publicized the aid this practice provided in catching predatory [[pedophiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pagliery |first1=Jose |title=FBI director: iPhones shields pedophiles from cops |url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/13/technology/security/fbi-apple/ |publisher=CNN |date=14 October 2014 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116194600/http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/13/technology/security/fbi-apple/ |archivedate=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents to this practice argue that leaving in a back door to law enforcement increases the risk of attackers being able to decrypt information, as well as questioning its legality under the [[US Constitution]], specifically being a form of illegal [[Search and Seizure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=van den Heuvel |first1=Katrina |last2=Cohen |first2=Stephen |title=Edward Snowden: A ‘Nation’ Interview |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/186129/snowden-exile-exclusive-interview |work=[[The Nation]] |date=28 October 2014 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204105726/http://www.thenation.com/article/186129/snowden-exile-exclusive-interview |archivedate=2015-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of '''friction of distance''' is based on the notion that [[distance]] usually requires some amount of [[Work (physics)|effort]], [[energy]], time, and/or other [[resource]]s to overcome.  Because of this "[[friction]]", spatial [[interaction]]s, especially [[transport]] and the particular case of [[human migration]], will tend to take place more often over shorter distances; amount and intensity of interaction will [[distance decay|decay with distance]].  Regardless of physical friction, the various [[cost]]s are metaphorically assumed to correspond to forces that impede movements.

Friction, be it physical or metaphorical, may be a continuous, smooth function or may contain jumps; it may be constant, linear, or nonlinear or a combination of jumps and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] effects, as with [[Intermodal freight transport]] and [[Intermodal passenger transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch7en/conc7en/frictionspace.html

The '''''Geschiedenis der Vaderlandsche Schilderkunst''''', often called ''Van Eynden and Van der Willigen'', is a 19th-century dictionary of artist biographies from the [[Netherlands]] published 1816-1842.

The reference work was started by [[Roeland van Eynden]], a painter and writer from the Northern Netherlands, as a follow-up to the work published by [[Arnold Houbraken]] and [[Jan van Gool]].&lt;ref name=Huygens&gt;[http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/retroboeken/vaderlandsche_schilderkunst/ ''Geschiedenis der Vaderlandsche Schilderkunst''] on the Huygens website&lt;/ref&gt; The work was published first in two volumes listing painters active before 1800. The third volume was published with contemporary painters, and it was finished after Van Eynden's death by publishing a 4th volume with corrections and additions which was written by his friend and colleague, [[Adriaan van der Willigen]], a Dutch writer known for his travelogues.&lt;ref name=Huygens/&gt;

[[File:Händelgesellschaft volume01 page 009.jpg|thumb|Page from Händelgesellschaft volume 1 (1858) – showing the work contained in the volume: Handel's oratorio ''[[Susanna (Handel)|Susanna]]'']]

Between 1858 and 1902, the '''Händel-Gesellschaft''' ("'''German Handel Society'''") produced a collected 105-volume edition of the [[List of compositions by George Frideric Handel|works]] of [[George Frideric Handel]]. Even though the collection was initiated by the society, many of the volumes were published by [[Friedrich Chrysander]] working alone (Chrysander was the major contributor for almost all of the volumes). The wording on the title page of the volumes is "''Georg Friedrich Händel's Werke. Ausgabe der Deutschen Händelgesellschaft''" which translates as "Georg Friedrich Handel's works. Edition of the German Handel Society". Chrysander's work has been criticised, however the scale of his achievement is also praised. The collection's abbreviation of "'''HG'''" can be used to identify individual works by Handel; for example Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' can be referred to as "HG xlv" (with the Roman numerals "xlv" indicating that the work is in volume 45).&lt;ref&gt;{{NewGrove2001|article=Handel, George Frideric|last=Hicks|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony Hicks|vol=x|pages=785}}&lt;/ref&gt; For practical use, the HG system has been superseded by the [[Händel-Werke-Verzeichnis|HWV]] numbering system. The 105 volumes do not contain the complete works of Handel—with at least 250 of his works unpublished in the collection.

==History==
Before the Händelgesellschaft, at least two collected editions of Handel's works had been produced. [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]]'s 180-volume collection was produced between 1787 and 1797—however, it was far from complete, and included, for example, only five of Handel's 42 Italian [[List of operas by Handel|opera]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Winton Dean, ''The New Grove Handel.'' NY: Norton, 1982, p. 116. {{ISBN|0-393-30086-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The other major collection was produced by the English Handel Society (founded by [[George Alexander Macfarren|Sir George Macfarren]]) between 1843 and 1858—however, it too was incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handel-edition.com/history.htm History of the HHA]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, the Händel-Gesellschaft was founded by Chrysander and the literary historian [[Georg Gottfried Gervinus]] (with Chrysander the only active editor).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfhandel.org/chron4.htm gfhandel.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123123543/http://gfhandel.org/chron4.htm |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The society==
Despite the reference to a "society" in the name of the ''Händel-Gesellschaft'' (including a [[board of directors]]), the edition was produced almost entirely by Chrysander, who carried on publication of the edition even when the society dropped out of the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gfhandel.org/edition.htm "Editions of Handel's Music"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310153712/http://gfhandel.org/edition.htm |date=2007-03-10 }} from gfhandel.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysander set up an office in the garden at his home, and from 1862 onwards personally superintended the engraving and printing of the edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicaltimes.co.uk/archive/misc/chrysander.html ''Karl Franz Friedrich Chrysander''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929024555/http://www.musicaltimes.co.uk/archive/misc/chrysander.html |date=September 29, 2006 }}--October 1901 obituary from ''[[The Musical Times]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he sold fruits and vegetables raised in his garden to derive further income during the years of publication.&lt;ref&gt;"Editions of Handel's Music," ''op. cit..''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first volume (1858) was prepared by [[Julius Rietz]] (although with results that displeased Chrysander).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoasm.org/X/HandelScores.html "Handel's Scores,"] at WBAI'S "Here Of A Sunday Morning" website.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Seiffert]] assisted with some of the later editing.&lt;ref&gt;"Editions of Handel's Music," ''op. cit..''&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its being more comprehensive than previous collections, the ''Händel-Gesellschaft'' edition was long considered the standard reference for Handel's works. When the ''[[Hallische Händel-Ausgabe]]'' was inaugurated in 1955, it was at first intended as a supplement to Chrysander's work, and only later (in 1958) became a full critical edition in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, ''op. cit.,'' p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Should add something about how the publication was a money-making venture—with the expectation that subscriptions would be sought from the public for the volumes. Subscription cost? --&gt;

==Criticism==
Some have criticised Chrysander's efforts, with one writer commenting that "he was an autocrat, a law into himself, who often made his selection according to his desires, who altered and revised at will, and who even falsified documents to suit his purposes,"&lt;ref&gt;"Handel's Scores," ''op. cit..'',&lt;/ref&gt; and another criticising his "arbitrary selection of material in the more complex works and his failure to explain his methods."&lt;ref&gt;Dean, ''op. cit..''&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are also problems such as the renumbering of the chamber sonatas originally published by Handel as his Op. 1 and Op. 2; for example, the Trio sonata in B flat for two violins and continuo, Op. 2 no. 3, appears in the ''Händel-Gesellschaft'' edition as Op. 2 no. 4. These renumberings by Chrysander resulted in confusion which still persists.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, ''op. cit.,'' pp. 117 and p. 153 (work list reference to Handel trio sonata).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1911 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica, Eleventh Edition]]'' comments that "The complete edition of the German ''Handelgesellschaft'' suffers from being the work of one man who would not recognize that his task was beyond any single man's power ... Yet Chrysander's services in the restoration of Handel are beyond praise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Handel, George Frederick |volume=12 |page=915 |first=Donald Francis |last=Tovey |authorlink=Donald Tovey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of the society==
[[File:Händelgesellschaft volume01 Page 013.jpg|thumb|Volume 1, page 13 of the Händelgesellschaft (1858) – detailing the structure of the society]]
At the time of the publication of the first volume of the Händelgesellschaft in 1858, the society was run by directors and a committee. The following details were taken from information printed in the first volume:

===Directors===
The directors (German: directorium) were:
*Jul. Rietz, Vorsitzender (president)
*M. Hauptmann, Sekretaer (secretary)
*[[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]], Cassirer
*Fr. Chrysander
*G. G. Gervinus

===Committee===
The 27 committee members (German: ausschuss) were:

The structure of the society was printed in the following fifteen volumes: 1, 5, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 23, 28, 34, 36, 56, 65, 71 and 76.

==Volumes==
The publications were labelled as "Lieferung" (which is German for "consignment" or "delivery") followed by a Roman numeral indicating the volume number. For example, the fourth volume (containing the oratorio ''Hercules'') was labelled as "Lieferung IV". The volumes are also sometimes referred to as "Bands".

Unless stated in the table below, Chrysander wrote a foreword for each volume. All volumes are in German, however most (again indicated below) include various English translations. Where a volume contains more than one work, the ordering of the HWV numbers indicate the order in which the works were published within the volume. The original German spelling of the volume titles has been retained.

The 105 volumes (which includes six supplement volumes) published in the Händelgesellschaft are (note that volume 49 was never published):

'''Industrial engineering''' is an inter-disciplinary profession that is concerned with the optimization of complex [[process (engineering)|processes]], [[system]]s, or [[organizations]] by developing, improving and implementing integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy and materials&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Salvendy, Gabriel. Handbook of Industrial Engineering. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc; 3rd edition p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;.     

Industrial engineers use specialized knowledge and skills in business administration, management, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences and methods of engineering analysis and design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results obtained from systems or processes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  From these results, they are able to create new systems, processes or situations for the useful coordination of man, materials and machines and improve the quality and productivity of systems, physical or social&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iienet2.org/details.aspx?id=716|title=What IEs Do|website=www.iienet2.org|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Depending on the sub-specialties involved, industrial engineering may also overlap with, [[operations research]], [[systems engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[production engineering]], [[management science]], [[management engineering]], [[financial engineering]], [[ergonomics]] or [[human factors engineering]], [[safety engineering]], or others, depending on the viewpoint or motives of the user.   

Even though its underlying concepts overlap considerably with certain business-oriented disciplines, such as [[operations management]], Industrial engineering is a longstanding engineering discipline subject to (and eligible for) [[professional engineering]] licensure in most jurisdictions.   

== History ==
{{See also|List of industrial engineers}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}

=== Origins ===
==== Industrial Revolution ====
There is a general consensus among historians that the roots of the Industrial Engineering Profession date back to the [[Industrial Revolution]].  The technologies that helped mechanize traditional manual operations in the textile industry including the [[Flying shuttle]], the [[Spinning jenny]], and perhaps most importantly the [[Steam engine]] generated [[Economies of scale]] that made [[Mass production]] in centralized locations attractive for the first time.  The concept of the production system had its genesis in the factories created by these innovations.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin&gt;Maynard &amp; Zandin. Maynard's Industrial Engineering Handbook. McGraw Hill Professional 5th Edition. June 5, 2001. p. 1.4-1.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Specialization of labor ====
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|225px|Watt's steam engine ([[Technical University of Madrid]])]]
Adam Smith's concepts of [[Division of Labour]] and the "Invisible Hand" of capitalism introduced in his treatise "[[The Wealth of Nations]]" motivated many of the technological innovators of the Industrial revolution to establish and implement factory systems.  The efforts of James Watt and Matthew Boulton led to the first integrated machine manufacturing facility in the world, including the implementation of concepts such as cost control systems to reduce waste and increase productivity and the institution of skills training for craftsmen.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

[[Charles Babbage]] became associated with Industrial engineering because of the concepts he introduced in his book "On the Economy of Machinery and Manufacturers" which he wrote as a result of his visits to factories in England and the United States in the early 1800s.  The book includes subjects such as the time required to perform a specific task, the effects of subdividing tasks into smaller and less detailed elements, and the advantages to be gained from repetitive tasks.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

==== Interchangeable parts ====
[[Eli Whitney]] and [[Simeon North]] proved the feasibility of the notion of [[Interchangeable parts]] in the manufacture of muskets and pistols for the US Government.  Under this system, individual parts were mass-produced to tolerances to enable their use in any finished product.  The result was a significant reduction in the need for skill from specialized workers, which eventually led to the industrial environment to be studied later.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

=== Pioneers ===
[[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] (1856 – 1915) is generally credited as being the father of the Industrial Engineering discipline.  He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Steven's University and earned several patents from his inventions.  His books, ''Shop Management'' and ''[[The Principles of Scientific Management]]'' which were published in the early 1900s, were the beginning of Industrial Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ingenieroindustrialpro.com/ All about industrial engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;  Improvements in work efficiency under his methods was based on improving work methods, developing of work standards, and reduction in time required to carry out the work.  With an abiding faith in the scientific method, Taylor's contribution to "Time Study" sought a high level of precision and predictability for manual tasks.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

The husband-and-wife team of [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]] (1868 – 1924) and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian Gilbreth]] (1878 – 1972) was the other cornerstone of the Industrial Engineering movement whose work is housed at Purdue University School of Industrial Engineering.  They categorized the elements of human motion into 18 basic elements called ''therbligs''.  This development permitted analysts to design jobs without knowledge of the time required to do a job. These developments were the beginning of a much broader field known as human factors or ergonomics.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

in 1908, the first course on Industrial Engineering was offered as an elective at [[Pennsylvania State University]], which became a separate program in 1909 through the efforts of [[Hugo Diemer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://industryengineering08.blogspot.com/2012/04/industrial-engineering-definition.html|title=Industrial Engineering - Definition, Explanation, History, and Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first doctoral degree in industrial engineering was awarded in 1933 by [[Cornell University]].

In 1912 [[Henry Laurence Gantt]] developed the [[Gantt chart]] which outlines actions the organization along with their relationships. This chart opens later form familiar to us today by [[Henry Wallace Clark|Wallace Clark]].

Assembly lines: moving car factory of [[Henry Ford]] (1913) accounted for a significant leap forward in the field. Ford reduced the assembly time of a car more than 700 hours to 1.5 hours. In addition, he was a pioneer of the economy of the capitalist welfare ("welfare capitalism") and the flag of providing financial incentives for employees to increase productivity.

Comprehensive quality management system ([[Total quality management]] or TQM) developed in the forties was gaining momentum after World War II and was part of the recovery of Japan after the war.

The [[Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers|American Institute of Industrial Engineering]] was formed in 1948. The early work by F. W. Taylor and the Gilbreths was documented in papers presented to the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] as interest grew from merely improving machine performance to the performance of the overall manufacturing process; most notably starting with the presentation by [[Henry R. Towne]] (1844 - 1924) of his paper ''The Engineer as An Economist'' (1186).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/transactionsof07amer#page/428/mode/2up Engineer as Economist]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern practice ===
In 1960 to 1975, with the development of decision support systems in supply such as the [[Material requirements planning]] (MRP), you can emphasize the timing issue (inventory, production, compounding, transportation, etc.) of industrial organization. Israeli scientist Dr. [[Jacob Rubinovitz]] installed the CMMS program developed in IAI and Control-Data (Israel) in 1976 in South Africa and worldwide.

In the seventies, with the penetration of Japanese management theories such as [[Kaizen]] and [[Kanban]], Japan realized very high levels of quality and productivity.  These theories improved issues of quality, delivery time, and flexibility.   Companies in the west realized the great impact of Kaizen and started implementing their own [[Continuous improvement]] programs.

In the nineties, following the global industry globalization process, the emphasis was on supply chain management and customer-oriented business process design. [[Theory of constraints]] developed by an Israeli scientist [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] (1985) is also a significant milestone in the field.

=== Compared to other engineering disciplines ===
Engineering is traditionally decompositional. To understand the whole, it is first broken into its parts. One then masters the parts and puts them back together, becoming the master of the whole.
Industrial and systems engineering's (ISE) approach is the opposite; any one part cannot be understood without the context of the whole. Changes in one part affect the whole, and the role of a part is a projection into the whole. In traditional engineering, people understand the parts first, then they can understand the whole. In ISE, they understand the whole first, and then they can understand the role of each part.

Also, Industrial engineering considers the human factor and its relation to the technical aspect of the situation and the all of the other factors that influence the entire situation&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehrer|first=Robert|date=|title=The Nature of Industrial Engineering|url=|journal=The Journal of Industrial Engineering|volume=5|pages=4|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while other engineering disciplines focuses on the design of inanimate objects 

"Industrial Engineers integrate combinations of people, information, materials, and equipment that produce innovative and efficient organizations. In addition to manufacturing, Industrial Engineers work and consult in every industry, including hospitals, communications, e-commerce, entertainment, government, finance, food, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, sports, insurance, sales, accounting, banking, travel, and transportation."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&amp;context=imsefacpub|title=DETAILS AND DESCRIPTION OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING|last=Savory|first=Paul|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

" Industrial Engineering is the branch of Engineering most closely related to human resources in that we apply social skills to work with all types of employees, from engineers to salespeople to top management. One of the main focuses of an Industrial Engineer is to improve the working environments of people – not to change the worker, but to change the workplace."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

"All engineers, including Industrial Engineers, take mathematics through calculus and differential equations. Industrial Engineering is different in that it is based on discrete variable math, whereas all other engineering is based on continuous variable math. We emphasize the use of linear algebra and difference equations, as opposed to the use of differential equations which are so prevalent in other engineering disciplines. This emphasis becomes evident in optimization of production systems in which we are sequencing orders, scheduling batches, determining the number of materials handling units, arranging factory layouts, finding sequences of motions, etc. As, Industrial Engineers, we deal almost exclusively with systems of discrete components."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
== Etymology ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}

===Etymology===
While originally applied to [[manufacturing]], the use of "industrial" in "industrial engineering" can be somewhat misleading, since it has grown to encompass any methodical or quantitative approach to optimizing how a process, system, or organization operates. In fact, the "Industrial" in Industrial engineering means the "industry" in its broadest sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Darwish|first=H|last2=van Dyk|first2=L|date=2016|title=The industrial engineering identity: from historic skills to modern values, duties, and roles|url=http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S2224-78902016000300006|journal=South African Journal of Industrial Engineering|volume=27|issue=3|pages=50-63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People have changed the term "industrial" to broader terms such as Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Industrial Engineering &amp; Operations Research, Industrial Engineering &amp; Management. 
== Sub-disciplines ==
Industrial engineering has many sub-disciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are industrial engineers who focus exclusively on one of these sub-disciplines, many deal with a combination of them such as Supply Chain and Logistics, and Facilities and Energy Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wonderfulengineering.com/what-is-industrial-engineering/|title=What is Industrial Engineering?|last=|first=|date=|website=Wonderful Engineering|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/Systems_Engineering_and_Industrial_Engineering|title=Industrial Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the undergraduate degree earned is the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) or Bachelor of Science and Engineering (B.S.E.) in Industrial Engineering (IE).  Variations of the title include Industrial &amp; Operations Engineering (IOE), and Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering (ISE).  The typical curriculum includes a broad math and science foundation spanning [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mechanics]] (i.e., statics, kinematics, and dynamics), [[materials science]], [[computer science]], electronics/circuits, [[engineering design]], and the standard range of engineering mathematics (i.e. [[calculus]], [[linear algebra]], [[differential equations]], [[statistics]]). For any engineering undergraduate program to be accredited, regardless of concentration, it must cover a largely similar span of such foundational work - which also overlaps heavily with the content tested on one or more engineering licensure exams in most jurisdictions.

The coursework specific to IE entails specialized courses in areas such as [[optimization]], [[applied probability]], [[stochastic]] modeling, [[design of experiments]], [[statistical process control]], [[Computer simulation|simulation]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[ergonomics]]/[[safety engineering]], and [[engineering economics]]. Industrial engineering elective courses typically cover more specialized topics in areas such as [[manufacturing]], [[supply chains]] and [[logistics]], [[analytics]] and [[machine learning]], [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]], [[human factors]] and [[industrial design]], and [[service system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/bachelors/industrial-engineering/courses | title=ISyE Undergraduate Courses | publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/ind_eng/ | title=Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IND ENG) | publisher=University of California, Berkeley | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/academics/bulletin/depts/ioe/courses | title=Courses | publisher=University of Michigan, Ann Arbor | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/courses/ | title=Courses | publisher=Northwestern University | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ise.illinois.edu/undergraduate/electives.html | title=ISE Electives | publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain business schools may offer programs with some overlapping relevance to IE, but the engineering programs are distinguished by a much more intensely quantitative focus, required engineering science electives, and the core math and science courses required of all engineering programs.

=== Differences in Teaching ===
While Industrial Engineering as a formal degree has been around for years, consensus on what topics should be taught and studied differs across countries. For example, Turkey focuses on a very technical degree while Denmark, Finland and the United Kingdom have a management focus degree, thus making it less technical.  The United States focuses on case-studies and group problem solving&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bachelorsportal.com/articles/636/what-is-industrial-engineering-and-why-should-i-study-it.html|title=What is Industrial Engineering and Why Should I Study It?|last=Oanca|first=Alexandra|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Practicing Engineers ==
Traditionally, a major aspect of industrial engineering was [[Plant layout study|planning the layouts of factories]] and designing assembly lines and other manufacturing paradigms. And now, in [[lean manufacturing]] systems, industrial engineers work to eliminate wastes of time, money, materials, energy, and other resources.

Examples of where industrial engineering might be used include flow process charting, process mapping, designing an assembly workstation, strategizing for various operational logistics, consulting as an efficiency expert, developing a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as [[supply-chain management]]), and shortening lines (or [[queueing theory|queues]]) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.

Modern industrial engineers typically use [[predetermined motion time system]], [[computer simulation]] (especially [[discrete event simulation]]), along with extensive mathematical tools for modeling, such as [[mathematical optimization]] and [[queueing theory]], and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization. Industrial engineers also use the tools of [[data science]] and [[machine learning]] in their work owing to the strong relatedness of these disciplines with the field and the similar technical background required of industrial engineers (including a strong foundation in [[probability theory]], [[linear algebra]], and [[statistics]], as well as having [[computer programming|coding]] skills).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25001">'''Instrumentalism''' is an interpretation within the [[philosophy of science]] that holds that a successful scientific theory reveals nothing known either true or false about nature's unobservable objects, properties or processes.&lt;ref&gt;
*[[Anjan Chakravartty]], [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §4 "Antirealism: Foils for scientific realism: §4.1: "Empiricism", in [[Edward N. Zalta]], ed, ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Summer 2013 edn: "Traditionally, instrumentalists maintain that terms for unobservables, by themselves, have no meaning; construed literally, statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity.  The most influential advocates of instrumentalism were the [[logical empiricist]]s (or logical positivists), including [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]], famously associated with the [[Vienna Circle]] group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors elsewhere.  In order to rationalize the ubiquitous use of terms which might otherwise be taken to refer to unobservables in scientific discourse, they adopted a non-literal [[semantics]] according to which these terms acquire meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example, '[[electron]]' might mean 'white streak in a [[cloud chamber]]'), or with demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called '[[operationalism]]').  Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately (in large measure) to the demise of [[logical empiricism]] and the growth of [[scientific realism|realism]].  The contrast here is not merely in [[semantics]] and [[epistemology]]: a number of logical empiricists also held the [[neo-Kantian]] view that [[ontological]] questions 'external' to the frameworks for knowledge represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is made solely on [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] grounds), thereby rejecting the [[metaphysical]] dimension of [[scientific realism|realism]] (as in Carnap 1950)".

*Samir Okasha, ''Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), [http://books.google.com/books?id=W2jCrzKYqxMC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]: "Strictly we should distinguish two sorts of anti-realism.  According to the first sort, talk of unobservable entities is not to be understood literally at all.  So when a scientist pus forward a theory about electrons, for example, we should not take him to be asserting the existence of entities called 'electrons'.  Rather, his talk of electrons is metaphorical.  This form of anti-realism was popular in the first half of the 20th century, but few people advocate it today.  It was motivated largely by a doctrine in the philosophy of language, according to which it is not possible to make meaningful assertions about things that cannot in principle be observed, a doctrine that few contemporary philosophers accept.  The second sort of anti-realism accepts that talk of unobservable entities should be taken at face value: if a theory says that electrons are negatively charged, it is true if electrons do exist and are negatively charged, but false otherwise.  But we will never know which, says the anti-realist.  So the correct attitude towards the claims that scientists make about unobservable reality is one of total agnosticism.  They are either true or false, but we are incapable of finding out which.  Most modern anti-realism is of this second sort".&lt;/ref&gt;  According to instrumentalists scientific theory is merely a tool whereby humans ''predict'' observations in a particular domain of nature by formulating laws, which state or summarize regularities, while theories themselves do not reveal supposedly hidden aspects of nature that somehow ''explain'' these laws.&lt;ref name=Torretti-Duhem/&gt;  Initially a novel perspective introduced by [[Pierre Duhem]] in 1906, instrumentalism is largely the prevailing theory that underpins the practice of physicists today.&lt;ref name=Torretti-Duhem&gt;Roberto Torretti, ''The Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [http://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=Duhem#v=twopage pp. 242–43]: "Like [[William Whewell|Whewell]] and [[Ernst Mach|Mach]], Duhem was a practicing scientist who devoted an important part of his adult life to the history and philosophy of physics.  ...  His philosophy is contained in ''La théorie physique: son objet, sa structure'' [''The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory''] (1906), which may well be, to this day, the best overall book on the subject.  Its main theses, although quite novel when first put forward, have in the meantime become commonplace, so I shall review them summarily without detailed argument, just to associate them with his name.  But first I ought to say that neither in the first nor in the second (1914) edition of his book did Duhem take into account—or even so much as mention—the deep changes that were then taking place in physics.  Still, the subsequent success and current entrenchment of Duhem's ideas are due above all to their remarkable agreement with—and the light they throw on—the practice of mathematical physics in the twentieth century.  In the first part of ''La théorie physique'', Duhem contrasts two opinions concerning the aim of physical theory.  For some authors, it ought to furnish 'the ''explanation'' of a set of experimentally established laws', while for others it is 'an abstract system whose aim is to ''summarize'' and ''logically classify'' a set of experimental laws, without pretending to explain these laws' (Duhem 1914, p. 3).  Duhem resolutely sides with the latter.  His rejection of the former rests on his understanding of 'explanation' ('explication' in French), which he expresses as follows: 'To explain, ''explicare'', is to divest ''reality'' from the ''appearances'' which enfold it like veils, in order to see the reality face to face' (pp 3–4).  Authors in the first group expect from physics the true vision of [[ding-an-sich|things-in-themselves]] that religious myth and philosophical speculation have hitherto been unable to supply.  Their explanation makes no sense unless (i) there is, 'beneath the sense appearances revealed to us by our perceptions, [...] a reality different from these appearances' and (ii) we know 'the nature of the elements which constitute' that reality (p 7).  Thus, physical theory cannot explain—in the stated sense—the laws established by experiment unless it depends on metaphysics and thus remains subject to the interminable disputes of metaphysicians.  Worse still, the teachings of no metaphysical school are sufficiently detailed and precise to account for all of the elements of physical theory (p 18).  Duhem instead assigns to physical theories a more modest but autonomous and readily attainable aim: 'A physical theory is not an explanation.  It is a system of mathematical propositions, derived from a small number of principles, whose purpose is to represent a set of experimental laws as simply, as completely, and as exactly as possible (Duhem 1914, p. 24)".&lt;/ref&gt;

Rejecting [[scientific realism]]'s ambitions to uncover metaphysical truth about nature,&lt;ref name=Torretti-Duhem/&gt; instrumentalism is usually categorized as an ''antirealism'', although its mere lack of commitment to scientific theory's realism can be termed ''nonrealism''.  Instrumentalism merely bypasses debate concerning whether, for example, a ''particle'' spoken about in [[particle physics]] is a discrete entity enjoying individual existence, or is an ''excitation mode'' of a region of a field, or is something else altogether.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;P Kyle Stanford, ''Exceeding Our Grasp: Science, History, and the Problem of Unconceived Alternatives'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), [http://books.google.com/books?id=_JIxeQ_sfzwC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=instrumentalism+particle+physics p. 198].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Torretti-pp396-97&gt;Roberto Torretti, ''The Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [http://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=#v=twopage pp. 396–97], including quote: "First, quantum field theories have been the working theories at the frontline of physics for over 30 years.  Second, these theories appear to do away with the familiar conception of physical systems as aggregates of substantive individual particles.  This conception was already undermined by [[Bose–Einstein statistics|Bose–Einstein]] and [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] (§6.1.4), according to which the so-called particles cannot be assigned a definite trajectory in ordinary space.  But quantum field theories go a long step further and—or so it would seem—conceive 'particles' as excitation modes of the field.  This, I presume, motivated Howard Stein's saying that 'the quantum theory of fields is the contemporary locus of metaphysical research' (1970, p. 285).  Finally, the very fact that physicists conspicuously and fruitfully resort to unperspicacious theories can teach us something about the aim and reach of science.  Here is how physicists work, dirty-handed, in their everyday practice, a far cry from what is taught at the Sunday school of the 'scientific worldview' ".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann&gt;Meinard Kuhlmann, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/physicists-debate-whether-world-made-of-particles-fields-or-something-else "Physicists debate whether the world is made of particles or fields—or something else entirely], ''Scientific American'', 2013 Aug;'''309'''(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Instrumentalism holds that theoretical terms need only be useful to predict the phenomena, the observed outcomes.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

Instrumentalism is a variety of [[scientific anti-realism]].

==History==
===British empiricism===
{{main|British empiricism}}
Newton's theory of motion, whereby any object instantly interacts with all other objects across the universe, motivated the founder of [[British empiricism]], [[John Locke]], to speculate that matter is capable of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  The next leading British empiricist, [[George Berkeley]], argued that an object's putative primary qualities as recognized by scientists, such as shape, extension, and impenetrability, are inconceivable without the putative secondary qualities of color, hardness, warmth, and so on. He also posed the question how or why an object could be properly conceived to exist independently of any perception of it.&lt;ref&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 101–02.&lt;/ref&gt;  Berkeley did not object to everyday talk about the reality of objects, but instead took issue with philosophers' talk, who spoke as if they knew something beyond sensory impressions that ordinary folk did not.&lt;ref name="Torretti 1999 p. 102"&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Berkeley, a scientific theory does not state causes or explanations, but simply identifies perceived types of objects and traces their typical regularities.&lt;ref name="Torretti 1999 p. 102"/&gt;  Berkeley thus anticipated the basis of what [[Auguste Comte]] in the 1830s called ''positivism'',&lt;ref name="Torretti 1999 p. 102"/&gt; although Comtean positivism added other principles concerning the scope, method, and uses of science that Berkeley would have disavowed.  Berkeley also noted the usefulness of a scientific theory having terms that merely serve to aid calculations without their having to refer to anything in particular, so long as they proved useful in practice.&lt;ref name="Torretti 1999 p. 102"/&gt;  Berkeley thus predated the insight that Logical Positivists-who originated in the late 1920s, but who, by the 1950s, had softened into Logical Empiricists-would be compelled to accept: theoretical terms in science do not always translate into observational terms.&lt;ref&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last great British empiricist, [[David Hume]], posed a number of challenges to Bacon's inductivism, which had been the prevailing, or at least the professed view concerning the attainment of scientific knowledge.  Regarding himself as having placed his own [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] on par with Newton's theory of motion, Hume supposed that he had championed inductivism over scientific realism.  Upon reading Hume's work, Immanuel Kant was "awakened from dogmatic slumber", and thus sought to neutralise any threat to science posed by Humean empiricism.  Kant would develop the first stark philosophy of physics.&lt;ref&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 98: "I shall dwell at some length on Kant's conception of the sources and scope of Newton's conceptual frame, for it was the first full-blown philosophy of physics and remains to this day the most significant".&lt;/ref&gt;

===German idealism===
{{main|German idealism}}
To save Newton's law of universal gravitation, [[Immanuel Kant]] reasoned that the mind is the precondition of experience and so, as the bridge from the [[noumena]], which are how the world's [[ding-an-sich|things exist in themselves]], to the [[phenomena]], which are humans' recognized experiences.  And so mind itself contains the structure that determines ''space'', ''time'', and ''substance'', how mind's own categorization of noumena renders space Euclidean, time constant, and objects' motions exhibiting the very determinism predicted by Newtonian.  Kant apparently presumed that the human mind, rather than a phenomenon itself that had evolved, had been predetermined and set forth upon the creation of humankind.  In any event, the mind also was the veil of appearance that scientific methods could never lift.  And yet the mind could ponder itself and discover such truths.  Kant's metaphysics, then, [[transcendental idealism]], secured science from doubt, and yet discarded hope of scientific realism.  Meanwhile, it was a watershed for idealist metaphysics, and launched [[German idealism]], most influentially [[Hegel]]'s [[absolute idealism]] or objective idealism, or at least interpretations, often misinterpretations, and political misuses, of it.

===Logical empiricism===
{{main|Logical empiricism}}
According the mind virtually no power to know anything beyond direct sensory experience, [[Ernst Mach]]'s early version of [[logical positivism]] ([[empirio-criticism]]) verged on idealism.  It was alleged to even be a surreptitious [[solipsism]], whereby all that exists is one's own mind.  Mach's positivism also strongly asserted the ultimate [[unity of science|unity of the empirical science]]s.  Mach's positivism asserted [[phenomenalism]] as to new basis of scientific theory, all scientific terms to refer to either actual or potential sensations, thus eliminating hypotheses while permitting such seemingly disparate scientific theories as physical and psychological to share terms and forms.  Phenomenalism was insuperably difficult to implement, yet heavily influenced a new generation of philosophers of science, who emerged in the 1920s while terming themselves ''logical positivists'' while pursuing a program termed ''[[verificationism]]''.  Logical positivists aimed not to instruct or restrict scientists, but to enlighten and structure philosophical discourse to render ''scientific philosophy'' that would verify philosophical statements as well as scientific theories, and align all human knowledge into a ''scientific worldview'', freeing humankind from so many of its problems due to confused or unclear language.

The verificationists expected a strict gap between ''theory'' versus ''observation'', mirrored by a theory's ''[[theoretical term]]s'' versus ''[[observable term]]s''.  Believing a theory's posited unobservables to always correspond to observations, the verificationists viewed a scientific theory's theoretical terms, such as ''electron'', as metaphorical or elliptical at observations, such as ''white streak in [[cloud chamber]]''.  They believed that scientific terms lacked meanings unto themselves, but acquired meanings from the logical structure that was the entire theory that in turn matched ''patterns of experience''.  So by translating theoretical terms into observational terms and then decoding the theory's mathematical/logical structure, one could check whether the statement indeed matched patterns of experience, and thereby verify the scientific theory false or true.  Such verification would be possible, as never before in science, since translation of theoretical terms into observational terms would make the scientific theory purely empirical, none metaphysical.  Yet the logical positivists ran into insuperable difficulties.  [[Moritz Schlick]] debated with [[Otto Neurath]] over [[foundationalism]]—the traditional view traced to Descartes as founder of modern Western philosophy—whereupon only nonfoundationalism was found tenable.  Science, then, could not find a secure foundation of indubitable truth.

And since science aims to reveal not private but public truths, verificationists switched from phenomenalism to [[physicalism]], whereby scientific theory refers to objects observable in space and at least in principle already recognizable by physicists.  Finding strict empiricism untenable, verificationism underwent "liberalization of empiricism".  [[Rudolf Carnap]] even suggested that empiricism's basis was pragmatic.  Recognizing that verification—proving a theory false or true—was unattainable, they discarded that demand and focused on ''confirmation theory''.  Carnap sought simply to quantify a universal law's ''degree of confirmation''—its probable truth—but, despite his great mathematical and logical skill, discovered equations never operable to yield over ''zero'' degree of confirmation. [[Carl Hempel]] found the [[Raven paradox|paradox of confirmation]].  By the 1950s, the verificationists had established philosophy of science as subdiscipline within academia's philosophy departments.  By 1962, verificationists had asked and endeavored to answer seemingly all the great questions about scientific theory.  Their discoveries showed that the idealized ''scientific worldview'' was naively mistaken.  By then the leader of the legendary venture, Hempel raised the white flag that signaled verificationism's demise.  Suddenly striking Western society, then, was Kuhn's landmark thesis, introduced by none other than Carnap, verificationism's greatest firebrand.  Instrumentalism exhibited by ''scientists'' often does not even discern unobservable from observable entities.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

===Historical turn===
{{main|Historical turn}}
From the 1930s until [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', there were roughly two prevailing views about the nature of science.  The popular view was [[scientific realism]], which usually involved a belief that science was progressively unveiling a truer view, and building a better understanding, of nature.  The professional approach was [[logical empiricism]], wherein a scientific theory was held to be a logical structure whose terms all ultimately refer to some form of observation, while an objective process neutrally arbiters theory choice, compelling scientists to decide which scientific theory was superior.  Physicists knew better, but, busy developing the [[Standard Model]], were so steeped in developing [[quantum field theory]], that their talk, largely metaphorical, perhaps even metaphysical, was unintelligible to the public, while the steep mathematics warded off philosophers of physics.&lt;ref name=Torretti-pp396-97/&gt;  By the 1980s, physicists regarded not ''particles'', but ''fields'' as the more fundamental, and no longer even hoped to discover what entities and processes might be truly fundamental to nature, perhaps not even the field.&lt;ref name=Torretti-pp396-97/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann/&gt;  Kuhn had not claimed to have developed a novel thesis, but instead hoped to synthesize more usefully recent developments in the philosophy of science.

In 1906, Duhem had introduced the problem of the [[underdetermination|underdetermination of theory by data]], since any dataset could be consistent with several different explanations, how the success of any prediction does not, by [[affirming the consequent]], a [[deductive fallacy]], logically confirm the truth of the theory in question.  In the 1930s, [[Ludwik Fleck]] had explained the role of [[perspectivism]] ([[logology]]) in science whereby scientists are trained in ''thought collectives'' to adopt particular ''thought styles'' setting expectations for a proper scientific question, scientific experiment, and scientific data.  Scientists manipulate experimental conditions to obtain results that cohere with their own expectations—what the scientists presuppose is realistic—and as a result might be tempted to invoke the [[experimenter's regress]] in order to reject unexpected results. They would then redo these experiments under what were supposedly better and more conducive conditions.  By the 1960s, physicists recognized two, differing roles of physical theory, ''formalism'' and ''interpretation''. Formalism involved mathematical equations and axioms that, upon input of physical data, yielded certain predictions.  Interpretation sought to explain ''why'' they succeeded. 

Widely read, Kuhn's 1962 thesis seemed to shatter logical empiricism, whose paradigmatic science was physics and which championed instrumentalism.  Yet scientific realists, who were far more tenacious, responded by attacking Kuhn's thesis, perennially depicted thereafter as either illuminated or infamous.  Kuhn later indicated that his thesis had been so widely misunderstood that he himself was not a ''Kuhnian''.  With logical empiricism's demise, [[Karl Popper]]'s falsificationism was in the ascendancy, and Popper was knighted in 1965. Yet in 1961, the [[molecular biology]] [[research program]] had made its first major empirical breakthrough in cracking the ''genetic code''. By the 1970s, [[molecular genetics]]' research tools could also be used for [[genetic engineering]].  In 1975, philosopher of science Hilary Putnam famously resurrected scientific realism with his ''no miracles'' argument, whereby the best scientific theories' predictive successes would appear miraculous if those theories were not at least ''approximately'' true about reality as it exists in and of itself beyond human perception.  Antirealist arguments were formulated in response.

===Revival of realism===
{{main|Scientific realism}}
By rejecting all variants of positivism via its focus on sensations rather than realism, [[Karl Popper]] asserted his commitment to scientific realism, merely via the necessary uncertainty of his own [[falsificationism]].   Popper alleged that instrumentalism reduces basic science to what is merely applied science.&lt;ref&gt;Karl R Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (London: Routledge, 2003 [1963]), {{ISBN|0-415-28594-1}}, quote: "Instrumentalism can be formulated as the thesis that scientific theories—the theories of the so-called 'pure' sciences—are nothing but computational rules (or inference rules); of the same character, fundamentally, as the computation rules of the so-called 'applied' sciences. (One might even formulate it as the thesis that "pure" science is a misnomer, and that all science is 'applied'.)  Now my reply to instrumentalism consists in showing that there are profound differences between "pure" theories and technological computation rules, and that instrumentalism can give a perfect description of these rules but is quite unable to account for the difference between them and the theories".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival of empiricism===
{{main|Constructive empiricism}}
[[Bas van Fraassen]]'s (1980)&lt;ref&gt;van Fraassen, Bas C., 1980, ''The Scientific Image'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; project of [[constructive empiricism]] focuses on belief in the domain of the observable, so for this reason it is described as a form of instrumentalism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/ Scientific Realism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''K.G. Subramanyan, a Retrospective''''' is a book by [[R. Siva Kumar]], released on the occasion of the fourth and largest retrospective show of [[K.G. Subramanyan]], which was curated by [[R. Siva Kumar]] at the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/K_G_Subramanyan_a_Retrospective.html?id=HcefAAAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition consisted of 300 paintings including  terracotta reliefs, reverse paintings on glass and acrylic, linocuts, lithographs, etching, silkscreens,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2009/stories/20030509000807900.htm&lt;/ref&gt; drawings, studies, children's books, toys and saras-paintings on terracotta platters-and the photographs of murals. and the range of materials includes terracotta, glass, paper, wood porcelain and metal cement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mag/2003/03/02/stories/2003030200130200.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The book offers an insight into the creative processes of [[K.G. Subramanyan]]. While tracing the various aspects of his creativity, the book provides the influences that shaped him and gives a kaleidoscopic view of his six-decade long artistic journey from [[Kerala]], [[Mahé, India|Mahe]], [[Santiniketan]], [[Slade School]] in [[England]], and later in various cities of [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saffronart.com/sitepages/ArticleDetails.aspx?Articleid=146&lt;/ref&gt;

This book features as a part of the syllabus of  Modern South Asian art at various universities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/m/reading-list-modern-south-asian-art/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Learning sciences''' ('''LS''') is an interdisciplinary field that works to further scientific understanding of [[learning]] as well as to engage in the design and implementation of learning innovations, and the improvement of instructional methodologies. Research in the learning science traditionally focuses on cognitive-psychological, social-psychological, and cultural-psychological foundations of human [[learning]], as well as on the design of learning environments. Major contributing fields include [[cognitive science]], [[computer science]], [[educational psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[applied linguistics]].  Over the past decade, researchers have also expanded their focus to the design of curricula, [[informal learning]] environments, instructional methods, and policy innovations.

== Domain definition ==
As an emerging discipline, the learning sciences are still in the process of defining itself.  Accordingly, the identity of the field is multifaceted, and varies from institution to institution.  However, the International Society of Learning Sciences (ISLS, [http://www.isls.org/]) summarizes the field as follows:  "Researchers in the interdisciplinary field of learning sciences, born during the 1990s, study learning as it happens in real-world situations and how to better facilitate learning in designed environments – in school, online, in the workplace, at home, and in informal environments. Learning sciences research may be guided by constructivist, social-constructivist, socio-cognitive, and socio-cultural theories of learning." ISLS has a large worldwide membership, is affiliated with two international journals: ''[[The Journal of the Learning Sciences|Journal of the Learning Sciences]]'', and ''[http://ijcscl.org International Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning]'', and sponsors the biennial Computer Supported Collaborative Learning conference and International Conference of the Learning Sciences on alternate years.

Although controlled experimental studies and rigorous qualitative research have long been employed in learning science, LS researchers often use [[design-based research]] methods.  Interventions are conceptualized and then implemented in natural settings in order to test the [[ecological validity]] of dominant theory and to develop new theories and frameworks for conceptualizing learning, instruction, design processes, and educational reform. LS research strives to generate principles of practice beyond the particular features of an educational innovation in order to solve real educational problems, giving LS its interventionist character.

== History ==

Several significant events have contributed to the international development of learning science. Perhaps the earliest history can be traced back to the [[cognitive revolution]].

In the United States, an important effort to create a graduate program in learning science took place in 1983 when [https://sites.google.com/site/janhawkinsaward/home Jan Hawkins] and [[Roy Pea]] proposed a joint program between Bank Street College and the [http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/ New School for Social Research].  Called "Psychology, Education, and Technology" (PET), the program had a planning grant supported by the Sloan Foundation. In the end the program would have required new faculty, though, and the institutions involved never established such a program. [[Roger Schank]]'s arrival at Northwestern University in 1988 helped start the Institute for Learning Sciences.  In 1991, Northwestern initiated the first learning science doctoral program, designed by and launched by [[Roy Pea]] as its first director.  The program began accepting students in 1992, and after Pea became dean the program directorship was taken over by Brian Reiser. Since that time, a number of other high quality graduate programs in learning science began to appear around the world, and the field is continuing to be recognized as an innovative and influential area for education research and design.

''[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/authors/hlnsauth.asp The Journal of the Learning Sciences]'' was first published in 1991, with [[Janet Kolodner]] as founding editor.  Yasmin Kafai and Cindy Hmelo-Silver took over as editors in 2009, and then Iris Tabak and Joshua Radinsky took over as editors in 2013. ''[http://ijcscl.org/ The International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning]'' was established as a separate journal in 2006, edited by Gerry Stahl and Freiderich Hesse. These journals, while relatively new in the field of education research, rapidly escalated and continue to place in upper ranks of the Educational Research section of the [[Social Sciences Citation Index]] impact factor rankings.

The Institute for the Learning Sciences hosted the first International Conference for the Learning Sciences (ICLS) in August 1991 at Northwestern University (edited by Lawrence Birnbaum, and published by the AACE but no longer available). The first biennial meeting of the ICLS also took place at Northwestern University, in 1994.  [http://www.isls.org The International Society of the Learning Sciences] was established in 2002.

==Distinguishing characteristics==

By integrating multiple fields, learning science extends beyond other closely related fields in distinguishable  ways.  For example, learning science extends beyond [[psychology]], in that it also accounts for, as well as contributes to [[Computing|computational]], [[sociological]] and [[anthropological]] approaches to the study of learning.  Similarly, learning science draws inspiration from [[cognitive science]], and is regarded as a branch of cognitive science; however, it gives particular attention to improving [[education]] through the study, modification, and creation of new technologies and learning environments, and various interacting and [[Emergence|emergent]] factors that potentially influence the [[learning]] of humans.

Many learning science researchers employ [[design-based research]] [[methodology]].  The growing acceptance of [[design-based research]] [[methodology]] as a means for study is often viewed as a significant factor distinguishing learning science from many of the fields that contribute to it. By including [[design-based research]] within its [[methodological]] toolkit, learning science qualifies as a "design science", with characteristics in common with other design sciences that employ [[Design Science (methodology)|design science]] such as [[engineering]] and [[computer science]].   Learning science is also considered by some as having some degree of overlap with [[instructional design]], although historically the two communities have come about in different ways and at times emphasized different programs of research, as described in a special issue of the journal ''Educational Technology'' in 2004.

However, it should be emphasized that [[design-based research]] is by no means the only [[research methodology]] used in the field.  Many other methodologies—including computational modeling, experimental and quasi-experimental research, and non-interventionist [[ethnographic]]-style qualitative research [[methodologies]]—have long been and continue to be employed in learning science.

The '''Leopold matrix''' is a qualitative [[environmental impact assessment]] method pioneered in 1971.&lt;ref name="Leopold"&gt;
{{cite book |title=A Procedure for Evaluating Environmental Impact |last1=Leopold |first1=Luna B. |last2=Clarke |first2=Frank E. |last3=Hanshaw |first3=Bruce B. |last4=Balsley |first4=James R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |series=Geological Survey Circular 645 |year=1971 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |location=Washington |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/cir645 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to identify the potential impact of a [[Project#Engineering project|project]] on the [[natural environment|environment]]. The system consists of a matrix with columns representing the various activities of the project, and rows representing the various environmental factors to be considered. The intersections are filled in to indicate the magnitude (from -10 to +10) and the importance (from 1 to 10) of the impact of each activity on each environmental factor.

Measurements of magnitude and importance tend to be related, but do not necessarily directly correlate. Magnitude can be measured, in terms of how much area is affected by the [[land development|development]] and how badly, but importance is a more subjective measurement. While a proposed development may have a large impact in terms of magnitude, the effects it causes may not actually significantly affect the environment as a whole. The example given by Leopold is of a [[stream]] that significantly alters the [[Erosion#Water|erosion]] patterns in a specific area, which will have a significant magnitude, but may not be important, provided the stream in question is swift moving and transports large amounts of [[soil]] anyway. In this case, an impact of significant magnitude may not actually be important to the environment in question.&lt;ref name="Leopold" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6550">==Life history method==

The method was first used when interviewing [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] and specifically Native American leaders who were asked by an interviewer to describe their lives with an insight as to what it was like to be that particular [[person]]. The purpose of the interview was to capture a living picture of a disappearing (as such) people/[[Lifestyle (sociology)|way of life]].

Later the method was used to interview [[criminal]]s and [[prostitutes]] in [[Chicago]]. Interviewers looked at [[Social work|social]] and [[police]]-records, as well as the [[society]] in general, and asked subjects to talk about their lives. The resulting report discussed (i) Chicago at that particular time; (ii) how the subject viewed their own life (i.e. `how it was like to be this particular person') and (iii) how society viewed the subject and whether they would be [[incarceration|incarcerated]], receive help, perform social work, etc.
 
The landmark of the life history method was developed in the 1920s and most significantly embodied in [[The Polish Peasant in Europe and America]] by [[W.I Thomas]] and [[Florian Znaniecki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Story of Life History: Origins of the Life History Method in Sociology|last = Goodson|first = Ivor|authorlink=Ivor Goodson|date = November 12, 2009|journal = Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;The authors employed a Polish immigrant to write his own life story which they then interpreted and analyzed. According to Martin Bulmer, it was "the first systematically collected sociological life history".&lt;ref name="Bulmer1986-54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Bulmer|title=The Chicago School of Sociology: Institutionalization, Diversity, and the Rise of Sociological Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0dJJZvcE2YC&amp;pg=PA54|date=15 August 1986|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-08005-5|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach later lost momentum as quantitative methods became more prevalent in American sociology. The method was revived in the 1970s, mainly through the efforts of French sociologist [[Daniel Bertaux]] and Paul Thompson whose life history research focused on such professions as bakers and fishermen. Major initiatives of the life history method were undertaken also in Germany, Italy, and Finland.

In the German context, the life history method is closely associated with the development of [[biographical research]] and biographical-narrative interviews. The [[narrative interview]] as a method for conducting open narrative interviews in empirical [[social research]] was developed in [[Germany]] around 1975. It borrowed concepts from [[Phenomenology (sociology)|phenomenology]] ([[Alfred Schütz]]), [[symbolic interactionism]] ([[George Herbert Mead]]), [[ethnomethodology]] ([[Harold Garfinkel]]), and [[sociology of knowledge]] ([[Karl Mannheim]]). The development and improvement of the method are closely connected to German sociologist [[Fritz Schütze]], part of the [[Bielefeld Sociologist’s Working Group]], which maintained close academic cooperation with American sociolinguists and social scientists such as [[Erving Goffman]], [[Harvey Sacks]], [[John J. Gumperz|John Gumpertz]], and [[Anselm Strauss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Köttig|first=Michaela|last2=Völter|first2=Bettina|date=December 2015|title=„Das ist Soziologe sein!“ – Ein narratives Interview mit Fritz Schütze zur Geschichte seines Werkes in der Soziologie|url=http://www.nwrsa.de/wp-content/uploads/Schuetze-Interview_1_2017.pdf|journal=Rundbrief 69/ Dezember 2015 der Sektion Biographieforschung in der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Soziologie|volume=|pages=35 – 53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of life histories was further developed by the biographical case reconstruction method of German sociologist [[Gabriele Rosenthal]] for the analysis of life ''history'' and life ''story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/handle/3/isbn-978-3-86395-374-4/rosenthal_interpretive.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Interpretive Social Research.

==Technique==
In both cases, the one doing the interview should be careful not to ask "yes or no"-questions, but to get the subject to tell "the story of his or her life", in his or her own words. This is called the "[[narrative]]" method. It is common practice to begin the interview with the subject's early childhood and to proceed [[chronology|chronologically]] to the present. Another approach, dating from the Polish Peasant, is to ask participants to write their own life stories. This can be done either through competitions (as in Poland, Finland or Italy) or by collecting written life stories written spontaneously. In these countries, there are already large collections of life stories, which can be used by researchers.

The [[ecclesiastical]] words most commonly [[abbreviate]]d at all times are [[proper name]]s, [[title]]s (official or customary), of persons or [[corporation]]s, and words of frequent occurrence. A list of those used in [[Roman Republic]]an and early [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] times may be seen in [[James Chidester Egbert, Jr.]]'s ''[[Latin Inscriptions]]'' ([[New York City]], 1896), 417–459.

The [[Jewish]] scribes and [[Talmudic]] scholars also had frequent recourse to abbreviations. Between the seventh and ninth centuries the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] system of abbreviations gave way to a more difficult one that gradually grew up in the monastic houses and in the chanceries of the new [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] kingdoms. [[Merovingian]], [[Lombardic language|Lombard]], and [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] scripts offer each their own abbreviations, not to speak of the unique scotica manus or libri scottice scripti ([[Irish language|Irish]] hand, or books written in the medieval Irish hand). Eventually such productive centres of technical manuscripts as the [[Papal Chancery]], the theological schools of [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]], and the civil-law school of [[Bologna]] set the standards of abbreviations for all [[Europe]].

Medieval manuscripts abound in abbreviations, owing in part to the abandonment of the [[uncial]], or [[quasi]]-uncial, and the almost universal use of the cursive, hand. The medieval writer inherited a few from [[Christian]] antiquity; others he invented or adapted, in order to save time and parchment. They are found especially in manuscripts of scholastic theology and canon law, annals and chronicles, the Roman law, and in administrative documents, civil and privileges, bulls, rescripts. They multiplied with time, and were never so numerous as on the eve of the discovery of printing; many of the early printed books offer this peculiarity, together with other characteristics of the manuscript page.

The development of printing brought about the abandonment of many abbreviations, while it suggested and introduced new ones a process also favoured by the growth of ecclesiastical legislation, the creation of new offices, etc. There was less medieval abbreviation in the text of books much used on public occasions, e.g. missals, antiphonaries, Bibles; in one way or another the needs of students seem to have been the chief cause of the majority of medieval abbreviations. The means of abbreviation were usually full points or dots (mostly in Roman antiquity), the semicolon (eventually conventionalized), lines (horizontal, perpendicular, oblong, wavy curves, and commas). Vowel-sounds were frequently written not after, but over, the consonants. Certain letters, like p and q, that occur with extreme. frequency, e.g. in prepositions and terminations, became the source of many peculiar abbreviations; similarly, frequently recurring words like et (and), est (is). Habit and convenience are today the principal motives for using abbreviations. Most of those in actual use fall under one or other of the following heads: [[Administration (business)|Administrative]], [[Liturgical]], [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]], and [[Chronological]].

==Administrative==
The first class of abbreviations includes those used in the composition of [[Pontifical]] documents. They were once very numerous, and lists of them may be seen in the works quoted below (e.g. [[Quantin]], [[Prou]]). It may be well to state at once that since 29 December 1878, by order of [[Leo&amp;nbsp;XIII]], the great papal documents ([[Litterae Apostolicae]]) are no longer written in the old [[goths|Gothic]] hand known as bollatico; all abbreviations, with the exception of a few obvious ones, like S.R.E., were abolished by the same authority ([[Acta Sanctae Sedis]], XI, 465–467). In the transaction of ordinary business the [[Roman Congregations]] are wont to use certain brief and pithy formulas (e.g. Negative = "[[Yes and no|No]]"; Negative et amplius = "No with emphasis"). They are not, correctly speaking, abbreviations. For a list of these see [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]]. This class includes also the abbreviations for the names of most sees. The full [[Latin]] titles of all existing (Latin) dioceses may be seen in the Roman annual, "[[Gerarchia Cattolica]]", a complete list of the Latin names of all known dioceses (extant or extinct) is found in the large folio work of the [[Count|Comte]] de [[Mas Latrie]], "Trésor de chronologie, d'histoire et de géographie" (Paris, 1884). For the same purpose the reader may also consult the episcopal catalogues of the [[Benedictine]] [[Pius Bonifacius Gams]], "[[Series Episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae]]" ([[Ratisbon]], 1873–86), and the [[Franciscan]] [[Conrad Eubel]], ''[[Hierarchia Catholica Medii Ævi]]'' ([[Münster]], 1898–1902). Under this general heading may be included all abbreviated forms of addresses in ordinary intercourse, whether of individuals or of members of religious orders, congregations, institutes, to which may be added the forms of addresses usual for members of [[Catholic]] lay societies and the [[Papal]] orders of merit. (See [[Catholic societies]], [[orders of merit]].) The abbreviations of the titles of [[Roman Congregations]], and of the individual canonical ecclesiastical authorities, belong also to this class.

==Liturgical==
A second class of abbreviations includes those used in the description of [[liturgical]] acts or the directions for their performance, e.g. the [[Holy Mass]], the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] ([[Breviary]]), the ecclesiastical devotions, etc. Here may also be classed the abbreviated forms for the name of [[God]], [[Jesus Christ]], and the [[Holy Ghost]]; also for the names of the [[Blessed Virgin]], the saints, etc.; likewise abbreviations used in the administration of the [[Sacraments]], mortuary epitaphs, etc. (to which class belong the numerous [[Catacomb]] inscriptions); finally some miscellaneous abbreviations like those used in the publication of documents concerning beatification and canonization.

==Scholastic==
In the third class belong scholastic abbreviations, used to designate honorific titles acquired in the schools, to avoid the repetition of lengthy titles of books and reviews, or to facilitate reference to ecclesiastical and civil legislation.

==Chronological==
In the fourth class of abbreviations belong all such as are used to describe the elements of the year, civil or ecclesiastical.

In [[fiction]], a '''MacGuffin''' (sometimes '''McGuffin''') is a [[plot device]] in the form of some goal, desired object, or another motivator that the [[protagonist]] pursues, often with little or no [[narrative]] explanation. The MacGuffin's importance to the plot is not the object itself, but rather its effect on the characters and their motivations.

The MacGuffin technique is common in films, especially [[Thriller film|thrillers]]. Usually, the MacGuffin is revealed in the first [[Act (theater)|act]], and thereafter declines in importance. It may reappear at the climax of the story but sometimes is actually forgotten by the end of the story. Multiple MacGuffins are sometimes derisively identified as '''plot coupons'''.&lt;ref name="ansible"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html |title=The Well-Tempered Plot Device |last=Lowe |first=Nick |authorlink=&lt;!-- not the comics writer (born 1979).

==History and use==
The use of a MacGuffin as a plot device predates the name ''MacGuffin''.&lt;ref name=mward /&gt;  The [[Holy Grail]] of [[Arthurian Legend]] has been cited as an example of an early MacGuffin, as the desired object that serves to advance the plot.&lt;ref name=mward&gt;Dr. Marjory T. Ward, "King Arthur Revisited" in Dr. Andrew Keen (ed.) "Proceedings of the Second History/Literature Conference on Medieval Literature"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World War I]]–era actress [[Pearl White]] used ''weenie'' to identify whatever object (a roll of film, a rare coin, expensive diamonds, etc.) impelled the heroes, and often the villains as well, to pursue each other through the convoluted plots of ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' and the other [[Movie serial#Silent era|silent film serials]] in which she starred.&lt;ref name="Lahue"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bound and Gagged: The Story of the Silent Serials |first=Kalton C. |last=Lahue |year=1968 |publisher=Oak Tree Pubs |isbn=978-0-498-06762-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1929 detective novel ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', a small [[statuette]] provides both the book's [[eponymous]] title and its motive for intrigue.

The name ''MacGuffin'' was coined by the English screenwriter [[Angus MacPhail]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McArthur|first=Colin|title=Whisky Galore! and the Maggie: A British Film Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnwROL7kGqwC&amp;pg=PP1|year=2003|publisher=I.B.Tauris|location=London|isbn=978-1-86064-633-1|p=21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224215809/https://books.google.com/books?id=HnwROL7kGqwC&amp;pg=PP1|archivedate=2017-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was popularized by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in the 1930s.

===Alfred Hitchcock===
The [[film director|director]] and [[film producer|producer]] Alfred Hitchcock popularized the term ''MacGuffin'' and the technique with his 1935 film ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', an early example of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marshall Deutelbaum |author2=Leland A. Poague |year=2009 |title=A Hitchcock reader |page=114 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Digou|first=Mike|title=Hitchcock's Macguffin In The Works Of David Mamet|journal=Literature Film Quarterly|date=October 2003|volume=31|issue=4|pages=270–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock explained the term ''MacGuffin'' in a 1939 lecture at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It might be a Scottish name, taken from a story about two men on a train. One man says, 'What's that package up there in the baggage rack?' And the other answers, 'Oh, that's a MacGuffin'. The first one asks, 'What's a MacGuffin?' 'Well,' the other man says, 'it's an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands.' The first man says, 'But there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands,' and the other one answers, 'Well then, that's no MacGuffin!' So you see that a MacGuffin is actually nothing at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interviewed in 1966 by [[François Truffaut]], Hitchcock explained the term ''MacGuffin'' using the same story.&lt;ref name="Truffaut"&gt;{{cite book|work=[[Google Books]]|authorlink=François Truffaut|title=Hitchcock/Truffaut|author=Truffaut, François|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC|date=1983|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082916/https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Framing Hitchcock: Selected essays from the Hitchcock annual|publisher=Wayne State University Press Detroit|pages=47–48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2ydVge4IiIC&amp;pg=PA47|work=[[Google Books]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082916/https://books.google.com/books?id=P2ydVge4IiIC&amp;pg=PA47|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock also said, "The MacGuffin is the thing that the spies are after but the audience don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyd |first=David |date=1995 |title=Perspectives on Alfred Hitchcock |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqZZAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=G. K. Hall |page=31 |isbn= 9780816116034 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's term ''MacGuffin'' helped him to assert that his films were in fact not what they appeared to be on the surface.  Hitchcock also related this anecdote in a television interview for [[Richard Schickel]]'s documentary ''The Men Who Made the Movies'', and in an interview with [[Dick Cavett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=cavettbiter|title=Alfred Hitchcock was confused by a laxative commercial|date=2007-10-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBRZ6GEFjG4&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-09-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503122702/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBRZ6GEFjG4|archivedate=2015-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screenwriter [[Angus MacPhail]], a friend of Hitchcock's, may have originally coined the term, according to the author Ken Mogg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~muffin/faqs_c.html#Answer%201 |title=Frequently asked questions on Hitchcock |author=Ken Mogg |work=labyrinth.net.au |date=May 12, 2006 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703212952/http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~muffin/faqs_c.html#Answer%201 |archivedate=July 3, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Lucas===
On the commentary soundtrack to the 2004 DVD release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', [[screenwriter|writer]] and [[film director|director]] [[George Lucas]] describes [[R2-D2]] as "the main driving force of the movie&amp;nbsp;... what you say in the movie business is the MacGuffin&amp;nbsp;... the object of everybody's search".&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;''Star Wars'' (1977) Region 2 DVD release (2004). Audio commentary, 00:14:44 – 00:15:00.&lt;/ref&gt; In TV interviews, Hitchcock defined a MacGuffin as the object around which the plot revolves, but as to what that object ''specifically'' is, he declared, "The audience don't care".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Thr-Tur/The-39-Steps.html |title=The 39 Steps – Film (Movie) Plot and Review |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193532/http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Thr-Tur/The-39-Steps.html |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Lucas believes that the MacGuffin should be powerful and that "the audience should care about it almost as much as the dueling heroes and villains on screen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indianajones200802?currentPage=4 |title=Keys to the Kingdom |date=February 2008 |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193209/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indianajones200802?currentPage=4 |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yves Lavandier===
For the filmmaker and drama writing theorist [[Yves Lavandier]], in the strictly Hitchcockian sense, a MacGuffin is a secret that motivates the villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#LEXI |title=Excerpts from Yves Lavandier's Writing Drama |website=Clown-enfant.com |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118203139/http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#LEXI |archivedate=January 18, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[North by Northwest]]''{{'}}s supposed MacGuffin is nothing that motivates the protagonist; Roger Thornhill's objective is to extricate himself from the predicament that the mistaken identity has created, and what matters to Vandamm and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] is of little importance to Thornhill. A similar lack of motivating power applies to the alleged MacGuffins of ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'', ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', and ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]''. In a broader sense, says Lavandier, a MacGuffin denotes any justification for the external conflictual premises of a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/index.htm |title=Yves Lavandier's Writing Drama |website=Clown-enfant.com |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113150601/http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/index.htm |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the mixed critical reception of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008), the primary criticism was that the [[crystal skull]] in the film was seen as an unsatisfying MacGuffin. The director [[Steven Spielberg]] said, "I sympathize with people who didn't like the MacGuffin because I never liked the MacGuffin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/10/26/steven-spielberg-indiana-jones-crystal-skull/?cnn=yes |work=Entertainment Weekly |title=Steven Spielberg admits he had reservations about 'Indiana Jones 4,' but still defends worst scene in 'Indiana Jones 4' |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193750/http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/10/26/steven-spielberg-indiana-jones-crystal-skull/?cnn=yes |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mire''' (or '''quagmire''') is a [[wetland]] type, dominated by living, [[peat]]-forming plants. Mires arise because of incomplete decomposition of organic matter, due to waterlogging and subsequent anoxia. Like [[coral reef]]s, mires are unusual landforms in that they derive mostly from biological rather than physical processes, and can take on characteristic shapes and surface patterning.

There are four types of mire: [[bog]], [[fen]], [[marsh]] and [[swamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Canadian wetland classification system|last=National Wetlands Working Group|year=1997|edition=2nd|publisher=University of Waterloo, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bog is a mire that due to its location relative to the surrounding landscape obtains most of its water from rainfall ([[ombrotrophic]]), while a fen is located on a slope, flat, or depression and gets most of its water from soil- or groundwater ([[minerotrophic]]). Thus while a bog is always acidic and nutrient-poor, a fen may be slightly acidic, neutral, or alkaline, and either nutrient-poor or nutrient-rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 |isbn=9780313327841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although marshes are wetlands within which vegetation is rooted in mineral soil, some marshes form shallow peat deposits: these should be considered mires. Swamps are characterized by their forest canopy and, like fens, are typically of higher pH and nutrient availability than bogs. Some bogs and fens can support limited shrub or tree growth on hummocks.

For botanists and ecologists, the term '''peatland''' is a more general term for any terrain dominated by peat to a depth of at least {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}, even if it has been completely drained (i.e., a peatland can be dry, but a mire by definition must be actively forming peat).

[[File:EE-Lahemaa-Bagno Viru.jpg|thumb|left|Wooded bog in [[Lahemaa National Park]], [[Estonia]]. 65% of mires in Estonia have been strongly affected or damaged by human activity in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Mires and Peatlands of Europe |year=2015 |editors= Joosten H., Tanneberger F. &amp; Moen, A. |publisher= Schweizerbart Science Publishers. Stuttgart }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Peat_cuttings_near_Unasary_-_geograph.org.uk_-_176303.jpg|thumb|left|Extraction of [[peat]] from derelict blanket bog, [[South Uist]], Scotland. This old bog is no longer forming peat because the vegetation has been changed, and therefore it is not a mire.]]
[[File:Borneo_fires_and_smoke,_2002.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite image of burning tropical peat swamp, [[Borneo]]. In 1997 alone, 73000ha of swamp [[Borneo peat swamp forests#Recent history|was burned in Borneo]], releasing the same amount of carbon as 13-40% of the mean annual global carbon emissions of fossil fuels. The majority of this carbon was released from peat rather than overlying tropical rainforest.]]
Mires, although perhaps at their greatest extent at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, are found around the globe. Mires occur wherever conditions are right for peat accumulation: largely where organic matter is constantly waterlogged. The distribution of mires therefore depends on topography, climate, parent material, biota and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Development of Peat Lands|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|last=Gorham|first=Eville|year=1857|volume=32|issue=2|pages=145–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of mire - bog, fen or swamp - depends also on each of these factors.

In polar regions, mires are usually shallow, because of the slow rate of accumulation of dead organic matter, and often contain permafrost. Very large swathes of Canada, northern Europe and northern Russia are covered by boreal mires. In temperate areas mires are typically more scattered due to historical drainage and peat extraction, but can cover large areas as [[blanket bog]] where precipitation is very high (e.g. in maritime climates inland near the coasts of the north-east and south Pacific, and the north-west and north-east Atlantic). In the sub-tropics, mires are rare and restricted to the wettest areas. In the tropics, mires can again be extensive, typically underlying tropical rainforest (e.g. in Kalimantan).

Mires are in rapid decline globally due to drainage for agriculture and forestry, and for peat harvesting. For example, more than 50% of original European mire area, more than 300000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, has been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wise use of mires and peatlands|last1=Joosten|first1=H.|last2=Clarke|first2=D.|year=2002|publisher=International Mire Conservation Group and International Peat Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
Mires have unusual chemistry, which influences ''inter alia'' their biota and the chemistry of the water outflow. Peat has very high [[cation-exchange capacity]] due to its high organic matter content: cations such as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are preferentially adsorbed onto the peat in exchange for H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Water passing through peat declines in nutrients and in pH. Therefore mires are typically nutrient-poor and acidic unless the inflow of groundwater (bringing in supplementary cations) is high.&lt;ref name=Rydin2006&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biology of Peatlands|year=2006|edition=1st|publisher=Oxford University Press|last1=Rydin|first1=Håkan|last2=Jeglum|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Height==
[[File:Ruwenzori_Upper_Bigo_Bog.jpg|thumb|right|A valley mire creates a level ground surface in otherwise dramatic topography. Upper Bigo Bog, [[Rwenzori Mountains]], [[Uganda]].]]
Mires elevate the ground surface above the original topography. Mires can reach considerable heights above the underlying mineral soil or bedrock: peat depths of above 10m have been recorded in temperate regions (many temperate and most boreal mires were removed by ice sheets in the last Ice Age), and above 25m in tropical regions.&lt;ref name=Rydin2006 /&gt; When the absolute decay rate in the ''catotelm'' (the lower, water-saturated zone of a mire) matches the rate of input of new peat into the catotelm, the mire will stop growing in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The limits to peat bog growth|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|last=Clymo|first=R.S.|year=1984|volume=303|pages=605–654|bibcode=1984RSPTB.303..605C|doi=10.1098/rstb.1984.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simplistic calculation, using typical values for a Sphagnum bog of 1mm new peat added per year and 0.0001 proportion of the catotelm decaying per year, gives a maximum height of 10m. More advanced analyses incorporate expectable nonlinear rates of catotelm decay.

== Carbon storage ==
All types of mires share the common characteristic of being saturated with water at least seasonally with actively forming [[peat]] while having its own set of vegetation and organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personal.ceu.hu/students/03/nature_conservation/wwddetail/Types_classif.html|title=Wetlands Types and Classifications|website=www.personal.ceu.hu|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Biogeochemical process of carbon===

Mires influence carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere such that when the water table rises, such as during a rainstorm, the peat and its microbes are submerged under water and inhibits the access to oxygen, giving opportunity for anaerobic microorganisms to flourish. Carbon dioxide is released when the water table shrinks, such as during a drought, as this supplies the aerobic microbes with oxygen to decompose the peat, subsequently releasing carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Alastair|date=2011-12-20|title=Carbon storage: When peat dries|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1360.pdf|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=En|volume=2|issue=1|pages=22–22|doi=10.1038/nclimate1360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, also varies with the water table position and somewhat with temperature. [[Methanogen|Methanogens]] are responsible for producing methane via decomposition of the peat which consequently increases as the water table rises and oxygen levels are depleted. Increased temperatures in the soil also contributes to increased seasonal methane flux, though at a lower intensity. It is shown that the methane increased by as much as 300% seasonal from increased precipitation and temperature of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turetsky|first=M. R.|last2=Treat|first2=C.

Mires are important reservoirs of climatic information to the past because they are sensitive to changes in the environment and can reveal levels of isotopes, pollutants, macrofossils, metals from the atmosphere, and pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Przewodnik do oznaczania torfów i osadów jeziornych|last=Tobolski|first=K|publisher=PWN|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon-14 dating]] can reveal the age of the peat. The dredging and destruction of a mire will release the carbon dioxide that could reveal irreplaceable information about the past climatic conditions.  It is widely known that a plethora of microorganisms inhabit mires due to the regular supply of water and abundance of peat forming vegetation. These microorganisms include but are not limited to methanogens, algae, bacteria, zoobenthos, of which [[Sphagnum]] species are most abundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuske|first=E|last2=Silamikele|first2=Inese|last3=Kalnina|first3=Laimdota|last4=Klavins|first4=Maris|date=2010-01-01|title=Peat formation conditions and peat properties: A study of two ombrotrophic bogs in Latvia|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285748071_Peat_formation_conditions_and_peat_properties_A_study_of_two_ombrotrophic_bogs_in_Latvia|journal=Mires and Peat}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peat in mires contain a substantial amount of organic matter, where [[humic acid]] dominates. Humic materials are able to store very large amounts of water, making them an essential component in the peat environment, contributing to an increased amount of carbon storage due to the resulting anaerobic condition. If the peatland is dried from long-term cultivation and agricultural use, it will lower the water table and the increased aeration will subsequently release carbon content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Environment|first=Szajdak, L., Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan (Poland).

Prematurely exposing the organic matter to the atmosphere promotes the conversion of organics to carbon dioxide to be released in the atmosphere. 
===Impacts on climate change===

[[Wetland|Wetlands]] provide an environment where organic carbon is stored in living plants, dead plants and peat, as well as converted to carbon dioxide and methane. Microbial activity is promoted by the large amounts of dissolved organic matter in wetlands, containing 45-50% carbon. [[Mineralization (geology)|Mineralization]] through bacterial oxidation converts this carbon to inorganic substances, allowing carbon storage to occur. Three main factors giving wetlands the ability to sequester and store carbon are the high biological productivity, high water table and low decomposition rates. Suitable meteorological and hydrological conditions are necessary to provide an abundant water source for the wetland. Fully water-saturated wetland soils allow anaerobic conditions to manifest, storing carbon but releasing methane.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kayranli|first=Birol|last2=Scholz|first2=Miklas|last3=Mustafa|first3=Atif|last4=Hedmark|first4=Åsa|date=2010-02-01|title=Carbon Storage and Fluxes within Freshwater Wetlands: a Critical Review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13157-009-0003-4|journal=Wetlands|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=111–124|doi=10.1007/s13157-009-0003-4|issn=0277-5212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetlands make up about 5-8% of Earth’s terrestrial land surface but contain about 20-30% of the planet’s 2500 Pg soil carbon stores.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitsch|first=William J.|last2=Bernal|first2=Blanca|last3=Nahlik|first3=Amanda M.|last4=Mander|first4=Ülo|last5=Zhang|first5=Li|last6=Anderson|first6=Christopher J.|last7=Jørgensen|first7=Sven E.|last8=Brix|first8=Hans|date=2013-04-01|title=Wetlands, carbon, and climate change|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-012-9758-8|journal=Landscape Ecology|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=583–597|doi=10.1007/s10980-012-9758-8|issn=0921-2973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mires, as well as bogs, fens and marshes are the wetland types that contain the highest amounts of soil organic carbon, and can thus be considered peatlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Köchy|first=M.|last2=Hiederer|first2=R.|last3=Freibauer|first3=A.|date=2015-04-16|title=Global distribution of soil organic carbon – Part 1: Masses and frequency distributions of SOC stocks for the tropics, permafrost regions, wetlands, and the world|url=https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-1-351-2015|journal=SOIL|language=English|volume=1|issue=1|pages=351–365|doi=10.5194/soil-1-351-2015|issn=2199-3971}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wetlands can become sources of carbon, rather than sinks, as the decomposition occurring within the ecosystem emits methane.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Natural peatlands do not have a measurable cooling effect on the climate in a short time span as the cooling effects of sequestering carbon are offset by the emission of methane, which induces warming. Despite this, peatlands do result in cooling of the Earth's climate over a longer time period as methane is oxidized quickly and removed from the atmosphere whereas atmospheric carbon dioxide is continuously absorbed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ramsar.org/document/peatlands-climate-change-mitigation-and-biodiversity-conservation|title=Peatlands, climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation {{!}} Ramsar|website=www.ramsar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the paper ‘Wetlands, carbon and climate change’ by Mitsch et al., it was determined “that methane emissions become unimportant within 300 years compared to [[carbon sequestration]] in wetlands. Within that time frame or less, most wetlands become both net carbon and radiative sinks.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Peatlands insulate the permafrost in subarctic regions, thus delaying thawing during summer, as well as inducing the formation of permafrost.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As the global climate continues to warm, wetlands could become major carbon sources as higher temperatures cause higher carbon dioxide emissions. Compared with untilled cropland, wetlands can sequester around two times the carbon, and planted wetlands may be able to store 2-15 times more carbon than what they release. Carbon sequestration can occur in constructed wetlands, as well as natural ones. Estimates of greenhouse gas fluxes from wetlands indicate that natural wetlands have lower fluxes, but man-made wetlands have a greater carbon sequestration capacity. The carbon sequestration abilities of wetlands can be improved through restoration and protection strategies, but it takes several decades for these restored ecosystems to become comparable in carbon storage to peatlands and other forms of natural wetlands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Impacts on society, agriculture, and industries===
Tropical peatlands comprise 0.25% of Earth’s terrestrial land surface but store 3% of all soil and forest carbon stocks and are mostly located in developing countries. The exploitation of these ecosystems, such as the draining and harvesting of tropical peat forests, releases a large amount of carbon dioxide. In addition, fires caused by dry peat due to the draining of peat bogs releases even more carbon dioxide. The economic value of a tropical peatland used to be derived from raw materials, such as wood, bark, resin, and latex; the extraction of which did not release carbon emissions. Today, many of these ecosystems are drained for conversion to palm oil plantations, releasing the stored carbon dioxide and preventing the system from sequestering carbon again. The planned [https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geography? Carbopeat Project] will attempt to assign economic value to the carbon sequestration performed by peat bogs to stop the exploitation of these ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wur.nl/en/show/Carbon-sequestration-in-peat-bogs-as-a-source-of-income.htm|title=Carbon sequestration in peat bogs as a source of income|work=WUR|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monochorionic twins''' are [[monozygotic]] (identical) [[twins]] that share the same [[placenta]].  If the placenta is shared by more than two twins (see [[multiple birth]]),  these are '''monochorionic multiples'''.  Monochorionic twins occur in 0.3% of all pregnancies.&lt;ref name=cordero&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cordero L, Franco A, Joy SD, O'shaughnessy RW |title=Monochorionic diamniotic infants without twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome |journal=J Perinatol |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=753–8 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16281049 |doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7211405 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 75% of [[monozygotic]] twin pregnancies are monochorionic;  the remaining 25% are ''dichorionic diamniotic''.&lt;ref name=Shulman/&gt;  If the placenta divides, this takes place after the third day after [[fertilization]].&lt;ref name=Shulman&gt;{{cite book |author=Shulman, Lee S.; Vugt, John M.

==Amniocity and zygosity==
[[File:Monoamniotic twins at 15 weeks.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abdominal ultrasonography]] of monoamniotic twins at a [[gestational age]] of 15 weeks. There is no sign of any membrane between the fetuses. A [[coronal plane]] is shown of the twin at left, and a [[sagittal plane]] of parts of the upper thorax and head is shown of the twin at right.]]
Monochorionic twins generally have two [[amniotic sac]]s (called Monochorionic-Diamniotic "MoDi"), but sometimes, in the case of [[monoamniotic twins]] (Monochorionic-Monoamniotic "MoMo"), they also share the same amniotic sac. Monoamniotic twins occur when the split takes place after the ninth day after fertilization.&lt;ref name=Shulman/&gt; Monoamniotic twins are ''always'' [[monozygotic]] (identical twins).&lt;ref name=pregnancy-info&gt;[http://www.pregnancy-info.net/monoamniotic.html Pregnancy-Info -- &gt; Monoamniotic Twins] Retrieved on July 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Monochorionic-Diamniotic twins are ''almost always'' monozygotic, with a few exceptions where the [[blastocysts]] have fused.&lt;ref name=Shulman/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

[[File:Ultrasound Scan ND 034.jpg|thumbnail|λ Sign in 8 week pregnancy]]

By performing an [[obstetric ultrasound]] at a [[gestational age]] of 10–14 weeks, monochorionic-diamniotic twins are discerned from dichorionic twins. The presence of a "T-sign" at the inter-twin membrane-placental junction is indicative of monochorionic-diamniotic twins (that is, the junction between the inter-twin membrane and the external rim forms a [[right angle]]), whereas dichorionic twins present with a "lambda (λ) sign" (that is, the chorion forms a [[Wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]]-shaped protrusion into the inter-twin space, creating a rather curved junction).&lt;ref name=Sepulveda1996&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sepulveda | first1 = W. | last2 = Sebire | first2 = N.

At ultrasound at a gestational age of 16–20 weeks, the "lambda sign" is indicative of dichorionicity but its absence does not exclude it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sepulveda | first1 = W. | last2 = Sebire | first2 = N. | last3 = Hughes | first3 = K. | last4 = Kalogeropoulos | first4 = A. | last5 = Nicolaides | first5 = K. | title = Evolution of the lambda or twin-chorionic peak sign in dichorionic twin pregnancies | doi = 10.1016/S0029-7844(97)85858-9 | journal = Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 439–441 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9052601 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the placentas may be overlapping for dichorionic twins, making it hard to distinguish them, making it difficult to discern mono- or dichorionic twins on solely the appearance of the placentas on ultrasound.

==Complications==
In addition to a shared placenta, monochorionic twins also have their [[circulatory system]]s intermingled in random and unpredictable [[circulatory anastomoses]]. This can cause disproportionate blood supply, resulting in [[twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]] (TTTS) in 20%&lt;ref name=cordero/&gt; of MoDi pregnancies. This is the main complication of monochorionic twins.

The 80% of MoDi pregnancies without TTTS still have high rates of birth weight discordance, [[fetal growth restriction]], prematurity and resultant [[cesarean section]] deliveries.&lt;ref name=cordero/&gt; One twin may also fail to develop a proper heart and become dependent on the pumping activity of the other twin's heart, resulting in [[twin reversed arterial perfusion]].&lt;ref name=Shulman/&gt; If one twin dies in utero, blood accumulates in that twin's body, causing [[exsanguination]] of the remaining twin.&lt;ref name=Shulman/&gt;

In the case of [[monoamniotic twins]] the risk of complications is substantially higher because of additional potential umbilical [[cord entanglement]] and [[Umbilical cord compression|compression]].&lt;ref name=pregnancy-info/&gt;  However, the [[perinatal mortality]] of monochorionic twins is fairly low.&lt;ref name=cordero/&gt;

Membership is targeted toward regional centers and institutes, research labs, and/or other groups and individuals with invasive species interests and qualification. Because invasive species are not restricted by jurisdictional boundary lines, it was formed as a single international network. Currently there are eight invasive species organizations in collaboration with NAISN.&lt;ref name="naisn" /&gt;

== Overview ==

In 1997, a letter  o-written by Don C. Schmitz, Dr. James T. Carlton, Dr. [[Daniel Simberloff]], and Dr. Phyllis N. Windle, and signed by more than 500 scientists, resource and agriculture officials, urged the [[U.S. government]] to form a commission to recommend new strategies to prevent and manage [[invasive species]].  One of the its recommendations was to form a center analogous to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to help coordinate the multi-jurisdictional aspects of invasive species management in the U.S. The letter resulted in   Executive Order 13112&lt;ref name="invasivespeciesinfo_a"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture. (2012). [https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/laws/execorder.shtml Executive Order 13112]. Retrieved 26 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; on February 3, 1999, calling for the establishment of a national plan and creating the National Invasive Species Council.
 
As a result of a November 2010 workshop, led by Don C. Schmitz and Dan Simberloff, seven invasive species centers or institutes and one federally funded Canadian research network agreed to become part of the North American Invasive Species Network (NAISN). Since then, NAISN has added another Canadian member&lt;ref name="naisn"&gt;{{cite web

In 2013, eight invasive species centers and institutes, and one regional network,  are part of the North American Invasive Species Network (NAISN) either as a hub (1) or a node (2).&lt;ref name="naisn"/&gt;

In 2011, NAISN was established as a non-profit organization in the United States (501(C)3) to unify  and connect these existing invasive species efforts into a single network,  .  Participating member organizations, groups, or individuals can participate as Hubs1, Nodes2, or Affiliates3.&lt;ref name="naisn" /&gt;

In April 2012, the third NAISN workshop was held to develop a five-year business strategic plan It is envisioned that, as NAISN grows and expands, the Network will work to enhance information exchange among scientists, government agencies, and private landowners through the use of a comprehensive website modeled after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, and the aggregation of information from over 250 current databases that contain information of invasive species .  NAISN will also begin to track invasive species expenditures through annual surveys of federal, provincial, state, municipal and tribal governments and oversee a comprehensive analysis of economic impacts of invasive species; such information could readily be used by policy-makers and elected officials.   Finally, NAISN will provide a single source for the news media and develop and implement national public awareness campaigns about invasive species.&lt;ref name="naisn" /&gt;

'''Perceived performance''', in [[computer engineering]], refers to how quickly a [[software feature]] appears to perform its task. The concept applies mainly to [[user acceptance]] aspects.

The amount of time an application takes to start up, or a file to download, is not made faster by showing a startup screen (see [[Splash screen]]) or a file progress [[dialog box]]. However, it satisfies some human needs: it ''appears'' faster to the user as well as providing a visual cue to let them know the system is handling their request.

In most cases, increasing real performance increases perceived performance, but when real performance cannot be increased due to physical limitations, techniques can be used to increase perceived performance at the cost of marginally decreasing real performance. For example, drawing and refreshing a progress bar while loading a file satisfies the user who is watching, but steals time from the process that is actually loading the file, but usually this is only a very small amount of time. All such techniques must exploit the inability of the user to accurately judge real performance, or they would be considered detrimental to performance.

Techniques for improving perceived performance may include more than just decreasing the delay between the user's request and visual feedback. Sometimes an increase in delay can be perceived as a performance improvement, such as when a variable controlled by the user is set to a running average of the users input. This can give the impression of smoother motion, but the controlled variable always reaches the desired value a bit late. Since it smooths out hi-frequency jitter, when the user is attempting to hold the value constant, they may feel like they are succeeding more readily. This kind of compromise would be appropriate for control of a sniper rifle in a video game. Another example may be doing trivial computation ahead of time rather than after a user triggers an action, such as pre-sorting a large list of data before a user wants to see it.

A technique to measure and interpret perceived performance remote systems is shown in a 2003&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[http://www.tmurgent.com/WhitePapers/PerceivedPerformance.pdf Perceived Performance]&lt;/ref&gt; and updated in 2005 for virtual machines.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;[http://www.tmurgent.com/WhitePapers/PerceivedPerformance_VirtualOS.pdf Perceived Performance and Virtual Operating Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''peripheral nerve interface''' is the bridge between the [[peripheral nervous system]] and a [[computer interface]] which serves as a bi‐directional information [[transducer]] recording and sending signals between the human body and a [[machine processing|machine processor]]. Interfaces to the nervous system usually take the form of electrodes for stimulation and recording, though chemical stimulation and sensing are possible.&lt;ref name= "Warren"&gt;Grill, W. M., Norman, S. E., &amp; Bellamkonda, R. V. (2009). Implanted neural interfaces: biochallenges and engineered solutions. Annual review of biomedical engineering, 11, 1–24. doi:10.1146/annurev-bioeng-061008-124927&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area is focused on developing peripheral nerve interfaces for the restoration of function following disease or injury to minimize associated losses. Peripheral nerve interfaces also enable electrical stimulation and recording of the peripheral nervous system to study the form and function of the peripheral nervous system. Many researchers also focus in the area of [[neuroprosthesis]], linking the human nervous system to [[Bionic hand#In medicine|bionics]] in order to mimic natural [[sensorimotor coupling|sensorimotor control]] and function.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;Donaldson PEK (1983). The Cooper cable: An Implantable Multiconductor cable for neurological prostheses. Med Biol Eng Comput 21:371-374&lt;/ref&gt; Successful implantation of peripheral nerve interfaces depend on a number of factors which include appropriate [[indication (medicine)|indication]], [[Perioperative| perioperative testing]], [[Differentiated instruction|differentiated planning]], and functional training.&lt;ref name="NavarroReview"&gt;Navarro, X., Krueger, T. B., Lago, N., Micera, S., Stieglitz, T., &amp; Dario, P. (2005). A critical review of interfaces with the peripheral nervous system for the control of neuroprostheses and hybrid bionic systems. Journal of the peripheral nervous system : JPNS, 10(3), 229–58. doi:10.1111/j.1085-9489.2005.10303.x&lt;/ref&gt; Typically [[microelectrode]] devices are implanted adjacent to, around or within the nerve trunk to establish contact with the peripheral nervous system. Different approaches may be used depending on the type of signal desired and attainable.

==Function==
The primary purpose of a [[neural interface]] is to enable two-way exchange of information with the nervous system for a sustained period of time to enable effective and high density stimulation and recording. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is responsible for relaying information from the brain and spinal cord to the extremities of the body and back. The function of a peripheral nerve interface is to assist the nervous system when peripheral nerve function is compromised. To supplement the roles of the nervous system, interfaces need to augment motor function as well as discern sensory information. The feasibility of peripheral nerve stimulation to achieve a desired motor output has been demonstrated and is one of the major driving forces for this area of research.&lt;ref name="Bhadra"&gt;Bhadra N, Peckham PH. 1997. Peripheral nerve stimulation for restoration of motor function. J. Clin. Neurophysiol. 14:378–93&lt;/ref&gt;  Information throughout the nervous system is exchanged primarily through [[action potential]]s. These signals occur at varying numbers and intervals dependent on both the [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomical]] and [[neurochemical]] make up of the individual and localized region. Information may be either introduced or read out by inducing or recovering action potentials from the body. Successful development and implementation of a peripheral nerve interface would allow for both the introduction of information to the nervous system, and extraction of information from the nervous system.

==Problems and limitations==
Problems and limitations in peripheral nerve interfacing are both biophysical and biological in nature. These challenges&lt;ref name= "Warren" /&gt; include:
*Fidelity of the interface in terms of functional resolution
*Relatively weak, noise-ridden electrical signals causing a challenging interface design constraint
*Interface implantation-associated injury to nerve fibers of interest
*Stability of the interface over time due to inflammation
*Managing inadvertent consequences such as pain or false sensory/motor stimulation due to physical movement or inflammation-associated triggering of neural activity

==Types==
A wide variety of electrode designs have been researched, tested, and manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6552092&amp;isnumber=6551989|title=M.

Research in this area seeks to address issues centered around peripheral nerve/tissue damage, access to efferent and afferent signals, and selective recording/stimulation of nerve tissue. Ideally peripheral nerve interfaces are optimally designed to interface with biological constraints of [[nerve fiber|peripheral nerve fibers]], match the [[list of materials properties#Mechanical properties|mechanical]] and [[list of materials properties#Electrical properties|electrical properties]] of the surrounding tissue, [[biocompatibility|biocompatible]] with minimal immune response, high [[sensor resolution#Resolution|sensor resolution]], are minimally [[Invasiveness|invasive]], and chronically stable with low [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s. Strongest signals are recorded from [[Node of Ranvier|nodes of ranvier]]. Peripheral nerve interfaces may be divided into extraneural and intrafascular categories.

===Epineurial electrode interface===
Epineurial electrodes are fabricated as longitudinal strips holding two or more contact sites to interface with peripheral nerves. These electrodes are placed on the nerve and secured by suturing to the epineurium. The suturing process requires delicate surgery and can be torn from the nerve if excessive motion creates tension. Since the electrode is sutured to the epineurium it is unlikely to damage the nerve trunk.

===Helicoidal electrode interface===
Helicoidal electrodes are placed cirumjacent to the nerve and are made of flexible platinum ribbon in a helical design. This design allows the electrode to conform to the size and shape of the nerve in attempts to minimize mechanical trauma. The structural design causes low selectivity. Helicoidal electrodes are currently used for FES stimulation of the [[vagus nerve]] to control intractable [[epilepsy]], [[sleep apnea]], and to treat depressive syndromes.

===Book electrode interface===
The book electrode consists of a silicone rubber block with slots. Each slot contains three platinum foils which function as electrodes, anode electrodes and one cathode. The spinal roots of the nerve are placed into these slots and the slots are then covered with a flap made of silicone and fixed with silicone glue. This electrode is mostly used to interrupt reflex circuits of the dorsal sacral roots and to control bladder function. Book electrodes are still considered very bulky.

'''Pharming''', a [[portmanteau]] of "farming" and "[[pharmaceutical]]", refers to the use of [[genetic engineering]] to insert [[gene]]s that code for useful pharmaceuticals into host animals or plants that would otherwise not express those genes, thus creating a [[genetically modified organism|genetically modified organism (GMO)]].&lt;ref name="worldwide"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-mol2.htm | title=Molecular farming | work=[[World Wide Words]] | accessdate=2008-09-11 | author=Quinion, Michael | authorlink=Michael Quinion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0509-e.htm | title=Molecular farming | publisher=[[Parliament of Canada]] | work=[[Library of Parliament]] | date=4 July 2005 | accessdate=2008-09-11 | author=Norris, Sonya | id=PRB 05-09E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharming is also known as '''molecular farming''', '''molecular pharming'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Molecular 'pharming' with plant P450s | first1=John M | last2=Chapple | first2=Clint | journal=[[Trends Plant Sci.]] | last1=Humphreys | year=2000 | volume=5 | issue=7 | pages=271–2 | doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(00)01680-0 | pmid=10871897}}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''biopharming'''.&lt;ref name="miller2003"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Henry I. | last1=Miller | title=Will we reap what biopharming sows? | journal=[[Nat.

The products of pharming are recombinant proteins or their metabolic products.  Recombinant proteins are most commonly produced using [[bacteria]] or [[yeast]] in a [[bioreactor]], but pharming offers the advantage to the producer that it does not require expensive infrastructure, and production capacity can be quickly scaled to meet demand, at greatly reduced cost.&lt;ref name=Kaiser&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kaiser, Jocelyn | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=25 April 2008 | url=http://people.forestry.oregonstate.edu/steve-strauss/sites/people.forestry.oregonstate.edu.steve-strauss/files/Is%20drought%20over%20for%20pharming%20Science%202007.pdf | format=PDF | title=Is the Drought Over for Pharming? | pmid=18436771 | doi=10.1126/science.320.5875.473 | volume=320 | issue=5875 | pages=473&amp;ndash;5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
THowever, in late 2002, just as ProdiGene was ramping up production of trypsin for commercial launch&lt;ref name="Press Release on Trypsin scale-up"&gt;{{cite press release |title=ProdiGene Launches First Large Scale-Up Manufacturing of Recombinant Protein From Plant System |publisher=ProdiGene |date=February 13, 2002 |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/prodigene-launches-first-large-scale-up-manufacturing-of-recombinant-protein-from-plant-system-75984427.html |accessdate=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was discovered that volunteer plants (left over from the prior harvest) of one of their GM corn products were harvested with the conventional soybean crop later planted in that field.&lt;ref name="News of contamination"&gt;[http://ngin.tripod.com/151102a.htm News of contamination]{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ProdiGene was fined $250,000 and ordered by the USDA to pay over $3 million in cleanup costs.  This raised a furor and set the pharming field back, dramatically.&lt;ref name=Kaiser /&gt; Many companies went bankrupt as companies faced difficulties getting permits for field trials and investors fled.&lt;ref name=Kaiser /&gt;  In reaction, APHIS introduced more strict regulations for pharming field trials in the US in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Biotechnology Regulatory Services Factsheet [Internet]: US Department of Agriculture; c2006. Available from: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/biotechnology/content/printable_version/BRS_FS_pharmaceutical_02-06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, [[Anheuser-Busch]] threatened to boycott rice grown in Missouri because of plans by [[Ventria Bioscience]] to grow pharm rice in the state.  A compromise was reached, but Ventria withdrew its permit to plant in Missouri due to unrelated circumstances.

The industry has slowly recovered, by focusing on pharming in simple plants grown in [[bioreactors]] and on growing GM crops in greenhouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1196/annals.1408.009 |title=Bioproduction of Therapeutic Proteins in the 21st Century and the Role of Plants and Plant Cells as Production Platforms |year=2007 |last1=Boehm |first1=Robert |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1102 |pages=121–34 |pmid=17470916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies and academic groups have continued with open-field trials of GM crops that produce drugs.  In 2006 [[Dow AgroSciences]] received USDA approval to market a vaccine for poultry against [[Newcastle disease]], produced in plant cell culture – the first plant-produced vaccine approved in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmexec.com/pharmexec/The-First-Plant-Derived-Vaccine-Approved-for-Chick/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/307471 FDA Approval News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400470 |title=Molecular farming for new drugs and vaccines |year=2005 |last1=Ma |first1=Julian K -C. |last2=Barros |first2=Eugenia |last3=Bock |first3=Ralph |last4=Christou |first4=Paul |last5=Dale |first5=Philip J. |last6=Dix |first6=Philip J. |last7=Fischer |first7=Rainer |last8=Irwin |first8=Judith |last9=Mahoney |first9=Richard |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=593–9 |pmid=15995674 |pmc=1369121|display-authors=8 |last10=Pezzotti |first10=M. |last11=Schillberg |first11=S. |last12=Sparrow |first12=P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mammals==

===Historical development===
Milk is presently the most mature system to produce recombinant proteins from transgenic organisms. Blood, egg white, [[seminal plasma]], and urine are other theoretically possible systems, but all have drawbacks. Blood, for instance, as of 2012 cannot store high levels of stable recombinant proteins, and biologically active proteins in blood may alter the health of the animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cimid.2007.11.005 |title=Production of pharmaceutical proteins by transgenic animals |year=2009 |last1=Houdebine |first1=Louis-Marie |journal=Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=107–21 |pmid=18243312}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expression in the  milk of a mammal, such as a cow, sheep, or goat, is a common application, as milk production is plentiful and purification from milk is relatively easy.  Hamsters and rabbits have also been used in preliminary studies because of their faster breeding.

One  approach to this technology is the creation of a transgenic mammal that can produce the biopharmaceutical in its milk (or blood or urine). Once an animal is produced, typically using the pronuclear microinjection method, it becomes efficacious to use cloning technology to create additional offspring that carry the favorable modified genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/80231 |year=2000 |last1=Dove |first1=Alan |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=1045–8 |pmid=11017040 |title=Milking the genome for profit}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2009 the US FDA granted marketing approval for the first drug to be produced in genetically modified livestock.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (2008) [http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/FDAVeterinarianNewsletter/ucm190728.htm FDA Approves First Human Biologic Produced by GE Animals] US Food and Drug Administration, from the FDA Vetenarian Newsletter 2008 Volume XXIII, No VI, Retrieved 10 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The drug is called [[ATryn]], which is antithrombin protein purified from the milk of genetically modified [[goats]].  Marketing permission was granted by the [[European Medicines Agency]] in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5041298.stm |title=Go-ahead for 'pharmed' goat drug |accessdate=2006-10-25 |format= |work= BBC News | date=June 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patentability issues===
As indicated above, some mammals typically used for food production (such as goats, sheep, pigs, and cows) have been modified to produce non-food products, a practice sometimes called pharming. Use of genetically modified goats has been approved by the FDA and EMA to produce [[ATryn]], i.e. recombinant [[antithrombin]], an [[anticoagulant]] [[Biologic medical product|protein drug]].&lt;ref&gt;Andre Pollack for ''The New York Times''. February 6, 2009 [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/business/07goatdrug.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 F.D.A. Approves Drug From Gene-Altered Goats]&lt;/ref&gt; These products "produced by turning animals into drug-manufacturing 'machines' by genetically modifying them" are sometimes termed [[biopharmaceuticals]].

The patentability of such biopharmaceuticals and their process of manufacture is uncertain. Probably, the biopharmaceuticals themselves so made are unpatentable, assuming that they are chemically identical to the preexisting drugs that they imitate. Several 19th century [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions hold that a previously known natural product manufactured by artificial means cannot be patented.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Stern. [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/MayoPro.pdf ''Mayo v Prometheus: No Patents on Conventional Implementations of Natural Principles and Fundamental Truths''], [2012] Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 502, 517. See ''Cochrane v. Badische Anili11 &amp; Soda Fabrik'', 111 U.S. 293, 311 (1884) (holding invalid claim to artificially made plant dye; "the product itself could not be patented, even though it was a product made artificially for the first time"); ''American Wood-Paper Co. v. Fibre Disintegrating Co.'', 90 U.S. 566, 596 (1874) (holding invalid claim to artificially manufactured paper-pulp because "whatever may be said of their process for obtaining it, the product was in no sense new").&lt;/ref&gt; An argument can be made for the patentability of the process for manufacturing a biopharmaceutical, however, because genetically modifying animals so that they will produce the drug is dissimilar to previous methods of manufacture; moreover, one Supreme Court decision seems to hold open that possibility.&lt;ref&gt;The ''American Wood-Paper'' case invalidated the product patent but left open the patentability of the process, saying "whatever may be said of their process for obtaining it...." 90 U.S. at 596.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it has been suggested that the recent Supreme Court decision in ''[[Mayo v. Prometheus]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Labs., Inc.'', 566 U.S. __, 132 S. Ct. 1289 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; may create a problem in that, in accordance with the ruling in that case, "it may be said that such and such genes manufacture this protein in the same way they always did in a mammal, they produce the same product, and the genetic modification technology used is conventional, so that the steps of the process 'add nothing to the laws of nature that is not already present.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H.

==In plants==
Plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs), also referred to as pharming, is a sub-sector of the [[biotechnology]] industry that involves the process of genetically engineering plants so that they can produce certain types of therapeutically important [[proteins]] and associated molecules such as peptides and secondary metabolites.  The proteins and molecules can then be harvested and used to produce pharmaceuticals.[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wnan.1462]

[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]] is often used as a [[model organism]] to study gene expression in plants, while actual production may be carried out in [[maize]], [[rice]], [[potatoes]], [[tobacco]], [[flax]] or [[safflower]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramessar|first=Koreen|last2=Capell|first2=Teresa|last3=Christou|first3=Paul|date=2008-02-23|title=Molecular pharming in cereal crops|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11101-008-9087-3|journal=Phytochemistry Reviews|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=579–592|doi=10.1007/s11101-008-9087-3|issn=1568-7767}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Tobacco has been a highly popular choice of organism for the expression of transgenes, as it is is easily transformed, produces abundant tissues, and survives well ''in vitro'' and in greenhouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jube|first=Sandro|last2=Borthakur|first2=Dulal|date=2007-07-15|title=Expression of bacterial genes in transgenic tobacco: methods, applications and future prospects|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19750137|journal=Electronic journal of biotechnology: EJB|volume=10|issue=3|pages=452–467|doi=10.2225/vol10-issue3-fulltext-4|issn=0717-3458|pmc=2742426|pmid=19750137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of rice and flax is that they are self-pollinating, and thus [[gene flow]] issues (see below) are avoided.  However, human error could still result in pharm crops entering the food supply.  Using a minor crop such as safflower or tobacco, avoids the greater political pressures and risk to the food supply involved with using staple crops such as beans or rice. Expression of proteins in plant cell or hairy root cultures also minimizes risk of gene transfer, but at a higher cost of production. Sterile hybrids may also be used for the bioconfinement of transgenic plants, although stable lines can't be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rice|first=J|last2=Mundell|first2=Richard E|last3=Millwood|first3=Reginald J|last4=Chambers|first4=Orlando D|last5=Stewart|first5=C|last6=Davies|first6=H|date=2013|title=Assessing the bioconfinement potential of a Nicotiana hybrid platform for use in plant molecular farming applications|url=https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6750-13-63|journal=BMC Biotechnology|language=En|volume=13|issue=1|pages=63|doi=10.1186/1472-6750-13-63|issn=1472-6750|pmc=3750662|pmid=23914736}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grain crops are sometimes chosen for pharming because protein products targeted to the endosperm of cereals have been shown to have high heat stability. This characteristic makes them an appealing target for the production of edible vaccines, as viral coat proteins stored in grains do not require cold storage the way many vaccines currently do. Maintaining a temperature controlled supply chain of vaccines is often difficult when delivering vaccines to developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=Hui-Ting|last2=Xiao|first2=Yuhong|last3=Weldon|first3=William C.|last4=Oberste|first4=Steven M.|last5=Chumakov|first5=Konstantin|last6=Daniell|first6=Henry|date=2016-06-01|title=Cold chain and virus-free chloroplast-made booster vaccine to confer immunity against different poliovirus serotypes|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pbi.12575|journal=Plant Biotechnology Journal|language=en|volume=14|issue=11|pages=2190–2200|doi=10.1111/pbi.12575|issn=1467-7644|pmc=5056803|pmid=27155248}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most commonly, plant transformation is carried out using ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]''.

==Regulation==
{{main|Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms}}

The regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of genetically modified crops. There are differences in the regulation of GM crops – including those used for pharming – between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.

==Controversy==
{{Main|Genetically modified food controversies}}

There are controversies around GMOs generally on several levels, including whether making them is ethical, issues concerning intellectual property and market dynamics; environmental effects of GM crops; and GM crops' role in industrial agricultural more generally.  There are also specific controversies around pharming.

===Advantages===
[[Plants]] do not carry [[pathogens]] that might be dangerous to human [[health]]. Additionally, on the level of [[pharmacologically]] active [[protein]]s, there are no proteins in plants that are similar to human proteins. On the other hand, plants are still sufficiently closely related to animals and humans that they are able to correctly process and configure both animal and human proteins. Their seeds and fruits also provide sterile packaging containers for the valuable therapeutics and guarantee a certain storage life.&lt;ref name="BioPro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio-pro.de/magazin/thema/00178/index.html?lang=en|title=Molecular Farming – Plant Bioreactors|publisher=BioPro|accessdate=2008-09-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718203226/http://www.bio-pro.de/magazin/thema/00178/index.html?lang=en|archivedate=2011-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Supply and demand|Global demand]] for [[pharmaceuticals]] is at unprecedented levels.  Expanding the existing [[microbial]] systems, although feasible for some therapeutic products, is not a satisfactory option on several grounds.&lt;ref name="ScienceD"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Molecular farming in plants: Host systems and expression technology | first1=Richard M. | last2=Stoger | first2=Eva | last3=Schillberg | first3=Stefan | last4=Christou | first4=Paul | last5=Fischer | first5=Rainer | journal=[[Trends Biotechnol.]] | year=2003 | volume=21 | issue=12 | pages=570–8 | doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2003.10.002 | last1=Twyman | pmid=14624867 | display-authors=3}}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many proteins of interest are too complex to be made by microbial systems or by [[protein synthesis]].&lt;ref name="sijmons"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nbt0390-217 |title=Production of Correctly Processed Human Serum Albumin in Transgenic Plants |year=1990 |last1=Sijmons |first1=Peter C. |last2=Dekker |first2=Ben M.

For these reasons, science has been exploring other options for producing proteins of therapeutic value.&lt;ref name="library"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;

These pharmaceutical crops could become extremely beneficial in developing countries.  The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that nearly 3 million people die each year from vaccine preventable disease, mostly in Africa.  Diseases such as measles and hepatitis lead to deaths in countries where the people cannot afford the high costs of vaccines, but pharm crops could help solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomson |first1=JA |title=Seeds for the future: The impact of genetically modified crops on the environment |location=Australia |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2006}}{{Page needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
While molecular farming is one application of [[genetic engineering]], there are concerns that are unique to it. In the case of [[genetically modified]] (GM) foods, concerns focus on the safety of the food for [[Ingestion|human consumption]]. In response, it has been argued that the genes that enhance a [[crop]] in some way, such as [[drought resistance]] or [[pesticide resistance]], are not believed to affect the food itself. Other GM foods in development, such as fruits designed to ripen faster or grow larger, are believed not to affect humans any differently from non-GM varieties.&lt;ref name="library"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BioPro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2001/11/48108|title=Molecular Farming Under Fire|last=Mandel|first=Charles|publisher=wired|accessdate=2008-09-13|date=2001-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, molecular farming is not intended for crops destined for the [[food chain]]. It produces plants that contain [[physiology|physiologically]] active compounds that accumulate in the plant’s tissues. Considerable attention is focused, therefore, on the restraint and caution necessary to protect both consumer health and environmental [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="library"/&gt;

The fact that the plants are used to produce drugs alarms [[activists]]. They worry that once production begins, the altered plants might find their way into the food supply or [[Pollination|cross-pollinate]] with conventional, non-GM crops.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;  These concerns have historical validation from the ProdiGene incident, and from the [[Transgenic maize|StarLink]] incident, in which [[Genetically Modified|GMO]] corn accidentally ended up in commercial food products.  Activists also are concerned about the power of business. According to the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]], in a recent report, says that U.S. demand alone for biotech pharmaceuticals is expanding at 13 percent annually and to reach a market value of $28.6 billion in 2004.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; Pharming is expected to be worth $100 billion globally by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.molecularfarming.com/about.html|title=Protein Products for Future Global Good|publisher=molecularfarming.com|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philology''' is the study of language in oral and written historical sources; it is the intersection between [[textual criticism]], [[literary criticism]], [[history]], and [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2joVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5 |title=Philology |last=Peile |first=John |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |year=1880 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philology is more commonly defined as the study of literary texts as well as oral and written records, the establishment of their authenticity and their original form, and the determination of their meaning. A person who pursues this kind of study is known as a philologist.

In older usage, especially British, philology is more general, covering comparative and historical linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/philology |title=philology |website=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/philology |title=philology |website=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical philology]] studies [[classical languages]]. Classical philology principally originated from the [[Library of Pergamum]] and the [[Library of Alexandria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=F. W.|title=A Companion to Classical Texts|year=1968|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford, England|pages=22–52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzW7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the fourth century BCE, continued by Greeks and Romans throughout the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]/[[Byzantine Empire]]. It was preserved and promoted during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], and eventually resumed by European scholars of the [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance]], where it was soon joined by philologies of other non-Asian (European) ([[Germanic philology|Germanic]], [[Celtic studies|Celtic]]), Eurasian ([[Slavistics]], etc.) and Asian ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Sanskrit grammarians|Sanskrit]], [[Sinology|Chinese]], etc.) languages. [[Indo-European studies]] involves the [[comparative linguistics|comparative]] philology of all [[Indo-European languages]].

Philology, with its focus on historical development ([[Synchrony and diachrony|diachronic]] analysis), is contrasted with [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistics]] due to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s insistence on the importance of [[Synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic analysis]]. The contrast continued with the emergence of [[structuralism]] and [[Chomskyan]] linguistics alongside its emphasis on [[syntax]].
{{wiktionary}}

== Etymology ==
The term "[[:wikt:philology|philology]]" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|φιλολογία}} (''philología''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23111282 |chapter=φιλολογία |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the terms {{lang|grc|φίλος}} (''phílos'') "love, affection, loved, beloved, dear, friend" and {{lang|grc|λόγος}} (''[[lógos]]'') "word, articulation, reason", describing a love of learning, of literature, as well as of argument and reasoning, reflecting the range of activities included under the notion of {{lang|grc|[[logos|λόγος]]}}. The term changed little with the Latin ''philologia'', and later entered the English language in the 16th century, from the [[Middle French]] ''philologie'', in the sense of "love of literature".

The adjective {{lang|grc|φιλόλογος}} (''philólogos'') meant "fond of discussion or argument, talkative", in [[Koine Greek|Hellenistic Greek]], also implying an excessive ("[[sophism|sophistic]]") preference of argument over the love of true wisdom, {{lang|grc|[[philosophy|φιλόσοφος]]}} (''philósophos'').

As an [[allegory]] of literary erudition, ''philologia'' appears in fifth-century postclassical literature ([[Martianus Capella]], ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii''), an idea revived in Late Medieval literature ([[Chaucer]], [[John Lydgate|Lydgate]]).

The meaning of "love of learning and literature" was narrowed to "the study of the historical development of languages" ([[historical linguistics]]) in 19th-century usage of the term. Due to the rapid progress made in understanding [[sound law]]s and [[language change]], the "golden age of philology" lasted throughout the 19th century, or "from [[Giacomo Leopardi]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] to [[Nietzsche]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.princeton.edu/nwegmann/ |title=Nikolaus Wegmann, Princeton University Department of German |publisher=Scholar.princeton.edu |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglo-Saxon world, the term philology to describe work on languages and literatures, which had become synonymous with the practices of German scholars, was abandoned as a consequence of anti-German feeling following [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]]. "Them Philologists: Philological Practices and Their Discontents from Nietzsche to Cerquiglini." ''The Year's Work in Medievalism'' 26 (2011): 4–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Most continental European countries still maintain the term to designate departments, colleges, position titles, and journals. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] opposed the nationalist reaction against philological practices, claiming that "the philological instinct" was "universal as is the use of language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tolkien |first=J. R. R. |authorlink=J. R. R. Tolkien |title=Philology: General Works |journal=The Year's Work of English Studies |volume=4 |number=1 |year=1923 |pages=36–37 |doi=10.1093/ywes/IV.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]]. "''Englische Philologie'' vs. English Studies: A Foundational Conflict", in ''Das Potential europäischer Philologien: Geschichte, Leistung, Funktion'', ed. Christoph König (Göttingen: Wallstein, 2009), pp. 34–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[British English]] usage, and in British academia, "philology" remains largely synonymous with "historical linguistics", while in [[US English]], and US academia, the wider meaning of "study of a language's grammar, history and literary tradition" remains more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna Morpurgo Davies|A.

(1977) p.&amp;nbsp;457.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the harsh critique of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], US scholars since the 1980s have viewed philology as responsible for a narrowly [[scientism|scientistic]] study of language and literature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]].

== Branches ==

=== Comparative ===
{{main article|Comparative philology}}
[[File:Indo European philology historical and comparative 1969.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Indo-European Philology: Historical and Comparative'' by [[William Burley Lockwood]] (1969)]]

The [[comparative linguistics]] branch of philology studies the relationship between languages. Similarities between [[Sanskrit]] and [[European languages]] were first noted in the early 16th century&lt;ref&gt;This is noted in Juan Mascaro's introduction to his translation of the ''Bhagavad Gita'', in which he dates the first ''Gita'' translation to 1785 (by Charles Williams). Mascaro claims the linguist [[Alexander Hamilton (linguist)|Alexander Hamilton]] stopped in Paris in 1802 after returning from India, and taught Sanskrit to the German critic [[Friedrich von Schlegel]]. Mascaro says this is the beginning of modern study of the roots of the Indo-European languages.&lt;/ref&gt; and led to speculation of a common ancestor language from which all these descended. It is now named [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. Philology's interest in ancient languages led to the study of what were, in the 18th century, "exotic" languages, for the light they could cast on problems in understanding and [[decipher]]ing the origins of older texts.

=== Textual ===
{{main article|Textual criticism}}
Philology also includes the study of texts and their history. It includes elements of [[textual criticism]], trying to reconstruct an author's original text based on variant copies of manuscripts. This branch of research arose among Ancient scholars in the 4th century BC Greek-speaking world, who desired to establish a standard text of popular authors for the purposes of both sound interpretation and secure transmission.  Since that time, the original principles of textual criticism have been improved and applied to other widely distributed texts such as the Bible.  Scholars have tried to reconstruct the original readings of the [[Bible]] from the manuscript variants. This method was applied to Classical Studies and to medieval texts as a way to reconstruct the author's original work. The method produced so-called "critical editions", which provided a reconstructed text accompanied by a "[[critical apparatus]]", i.e., footnotes that listed the various manuscript variants available, enabling scholars to gain insight into the entire manuscript tradition and argue about the variants.&lt;ref name = GB1&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JewJCYZlYV8C&amp;pg=PA9 |title=Textual Scholarship: An Introduction |first=D. C. |last=Greetham |publisher=Garland Publishing |year=1994 |accessdate=2011-07-16 |isbn=9780815317913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related study method known as [[higher criticism]] studies the authorship, date, and provenance of text to place such text in historical context.&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; As these philological issues are often inseparable from issues of interpretation, there is no clear-cut boundary between philology and [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; When text has a significant political or religious influence (such as the reconstruction of Biblical texts), scholars have difficulty reaching objective conclusions.

Some scholars avoid all critical methods of textual philology,&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; especially in historical linguistics, where it is important to study the actual recorded materials. The movement known as [[New Philology]] has rejected textual criticism because it injects editorial interpretations into the text and destroys the integrity of the individual manuscript, hence damaging the reliability of the data. Supporters of New Philology insist on a strict "diplomatic" approach: a faithful rendering of the text exactly as found in the manuscript, without emendations.

=== Cognitive ===
{{main article|Cognitive philology}}
Another branch of philology, cognitive philology, studies written and oral texts. Cognitive philology considers these oral texts as the results of human mental processes. This science compares the results of textual science with the results of experimental research of both psychology and artificial intelligence production systems.

=== Decipherment ===
In the case of [[Bronze Age literature]], philology includes the prior [[decipherment]] of the language under study. This has notably been the case with the [[Ancient Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]], [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Ugaritic]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]] languages. Beginning with the famous decipherment and translation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] by [[Jean-François Champollion]] in 1822, a number of individuals attempted to decipher the writing systems of the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]]. In the case of [[Old Persian]] and [[Mycenaean Greek]], decipherment yielded older records of languages already known from slightly more recent traditions ([[Middle Persian]] and [[Ancient Greek|Alphabetic Greek]]).

Work on the ancient languages of the Near East progressed rapidly. In the mid-19th century, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] and others deciphered the [[Behistun Inscription]], which records the same text in [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], using a variation of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] for each language. The elucidation of cuneiform led to the decipherment of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. [[Hittite language|Hittite]] was deciphered in 1915 by [[Bedřich Hrozný]].

[[Linear B]], a script used in the ancient Aegean, was deciphered in 1952 by [[Michael Ventris]] and [[John Chadwick]], who demonstrated that it recorded an early form of Greek, now known as [[Mycenaean language|Mycenaean Greek]]. [[Linear A]], the writing system that records the still-unknown language of the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoans]], resists deciphering, despite many attempts.

Work continues on scripts such as the [[Maya script|Maya]], with great progress since the initial breakthroughs of the phonetic approach championed by [[Yuri Knorozov]] and others in the 1950s. Since the late 20th century, the Maya code has been almost completely deciphered, and the Mayan languages are among the most documented and studied in Mesoamerica. The code is described as a [[logosyllabic]] style of writing, which could be used to fully express any spoken thought.

==In popular culture==

In the ''[[The Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]]'' by [[C.S. Lewis]], the main character, Elwin Ransom, is a philologist - as was Lewis' close friend [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].

Dr. Edward Morbius, one of the main characters in the science-fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'', is a philologist.

[[Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld]], the main character in [[Alexander McCall Smith]]'s 1997 comic novel ''[[Portuguese Irregular Verbs]]'' is a philologist, educated at Cambridge.

The main character in the [[List of submissions to the 84th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Award Nominee for Best Foreign Language film]] in 2012, ''[[Footnote (film)|Footnote]]'', is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] philologist, and a significant part of the film deals with his work.

'''Precisionism''' was the first indigenous [[modern art]] movement in the [[United States]] and an early American contribution to the rise of [[Modernism]].  The Precisionist style, which first emerged after [[World War I]] and was at the height of its popularity during the 1920s and early 1930s, celebrated the new American landscape of [[skyscraper]]s, bridges, and factories in a form that has also been called "Cubist-Realism."&lt;ref&gt;Milton Brown, ''American Painting from the Armory Show to the Depression'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1955), p. 114-115.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "Precisionism" was first coined in the mid-1920s, possibly by [[Museum of Modern Art]] director Alfred H. Barr.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Stavitsky, ''Precisionism in America, 1915-1941: Reordering Reality'' (New York: Abrams, 1994), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Painters working in this style were also known as the "Immaculates," which was the more commonly used term at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Stavitsky, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The stiffness of both art-historical labels suggests the difficulties contemporary critics had in attempting to characterize these artists.

== An American movement ==
[[File:NY Met demuth figure 5 gold.JPG|thumb|left|[[Charles Demuth]], ''[[I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold]]'', 1928, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]

Influenced by [[Cubism]] and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]], Precisionism took for its main themes [[industrialisation]] and the modernization of the American landscape, the structures of which were depicted in precise, sharply defined geometrical forms. Precisionist artists considered themselves strictly American and some were reluctant to acknowledge their European artistic influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/prec/hd_prec.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it was readily apparent at the time that the fracturing of planes in many Precisionist paintings originates in the Cubism of [[Picasso]] and [[Léger]]; similarly, Precisionist renderings of shafts of light as rigidly drawn "lines of force" is a clear borrowing from Futurism. In the end, Precisionism was less about pure originality of expression and more about an energetic American use and amalgamation of certain European modernist techniques. Part of precisionism's originality is found in its subject matter and outlook.

There is a degree of reverence for the industrial age in the movement, but social commentary was not fundamental to the style. Like [[Pop Art]], Precisionism has on occasion been interpreted as a criticism of the de-natured society it portrays, though its artists did not often feel comfortable with this reading of their work. [[Elsie Driggs]]' ''Pittsburgh'' (1926) illustrates this gap in perception.&lt;ref&gt;For a fuller discussion of ''Pittsburgh'', see Constance Kimmerle, ''Elsie Driggs: The Quick and the Classical'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008), pp. 31-33 and John Loughery, "Blending the Classical and the Modern: The Art of Elsie Driggs," ''Woman's Art Journal'' (Winter 1987), p 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  A painting of black and gray steel-mill smokestacks, thick piping, and crisscrossing wires, with only clouds of smoke to relieve the severity of the image, viewers have been tempted to see this dark painting as a statement of environmental concern. To the contrary, Driggs always claimed that she intended an ironic beauty in the image and referred to it as "my [[El Greco]]." Upon seeing the painting, Charles Daniel dubbed her "one of the new classicists."&lt;ref&gt;Kimmerle, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; More often than not, Precisionism implicitly celebrated man-made dynamism and new technologies.  Possible exceptions to this statement are some of the darker, more claustrophobic city paintings of [[Louis Lozowick]] and the comic anti-capitalist satires of [[Preston Dickinson]].

As might be expected, varying degrees of abstraction are found in Precisionist works. ''[[I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold|The Figure 5 in Gold]]'' (1928) by [[Charles Demuth]], a clamorous hommage to [[William Carlos Williams]]' imagist poem about a fire truck is abstract and stylized, while the paintings of [[Charles Sheeler]] sometimes verge on a form of [[photorealism]]. (In addition to his meticulously detailed paintings like ''River Rouge Plant'' and ''American Landscape'', Sheeler, like his friend [[Paul Strand]], also created sharp-focus photographs of factories and public buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/exhibitionInfo/exhibition/16202 Charles Sheeler photo, retrieved online November 9, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;)  The majority of Precisionist paintings and drawings, however, present no obstacles in identifying their imagery.  Some Precisionist work tended toward a ''"highly controlled approach to technique and form"'' as well as an application of ''"[[hard-edge painting|hard-edged]] style to long-familiar American scenes"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/prec/hd_prec.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; Precisionist artists aimed to convey the geometric and psychological essence of a scene or a structure but intended that essence to be almost immediately accessible.

Most Precisionist imagery is urban: office towers, apartment houses, bridges, tunnels, subway platforms, streets, the skyline and grid of the modern city.  Other artists, however, such as Charles Demuth, Niles Spencer, [[Ralston Crawford]], [[Sanford Ross]], and Charles Sheeler, applied the same approach to more pastoral settings and painted starkly geometric renderings of barns, cottages, country roads, and farm houses.  Artists such as [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Gerald Murphy]] painted Precisionist still lifes as well.

==Precisionists==
[[File:Wall Street by Paul Strand, 1915.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Strand]], ''[[Wall Street (photograph)|Wall Street]],'' 1915]]
Many American artists worked in a Precisionist style over a twenty-year period. [[George Ault]], [[Ralston Crawford]], [[Francis Criss]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[Preston Dickinson]], [[Elsie Driggs]], [[Louis Lozowick]], [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Charles Sheeler]], [[Niles Spencer]], [[Morton Schamberg]] and [[Joseph Stella]], were among the most prominent Precisionists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EED81439F932A25751C1A962958260&amp;fta=y The New York Times, Roberta Smith, ''ART VIEW: Precisionism And a Few Of Its Friends," October 26, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of their work can be found in most major American museum collections. [[Dale Nichols]], [[Millard Sheets]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/hilbert-museum-chapman-california-scene-paintings The Hilbert Museum reveals treasures of California Scene Painting, Liz Goldner, February 24, 2016 KCET https://www.kcet.org/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Berresford]], [[Henry Billings]], [[Peter Blume]], [[Stefan Hirsch]], [[Edmund Lewandowski]], [[John Storrs]], [[Miklos Suba]], Sandor Bernath, [[Herman Trunk]], [[Arnold Wiltz]], [[Clarence Holbrook Carter]], Edgar Corbridge and the photographers [[Paul Strand]] and [[Lewis Hine]] were other artists associated with Precisionism. The movement had no major presence outside the United States, although it did influence [[Australian art]] where [[Jeffrey Smart]] adopted its principles. Although no manifesto was ever created, some of the artists were friends and frequently exhibited at the same galleries. [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], especially with paintings like ''New York City with Moon'' (1926) and ''The Shelton With Sun Spots'' (1926), created her own more sensuous version of Precisionism, although her best-known works are not closely related to Precisionism, and it would be inaccurate to state that O'Keeffe (who vehemently resisted movement ties) was closely aligned with the Precisionist movement. Her husband, photographer and art dealer [[Alfred Stieglitz]], was a highly regarded mentor for the group and was especially supportive of Paul Strand.

Precisionist art would have an indirect influence on the later styles known as [[magic realism]], [[pop art]], and [[photorealism]], but it was largely considered a dated "period style" by the 1950s, though its influence on advertising imagery and stage and set design continued throughout the twentieth century. Its two most famous practitioners are Charles Demuth and Charles Sheeler.

{{Sociology}}
'''Public sociology''' is a subfield of the wider [[Sociology|sociological discipline]] that emphasizes expanding the disciplinary boundaries of sociology in order to engage with non-academic audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a ''style'' of sociology rather than a particular [[Scientific method|method]], [[theory]], or set of [[politics|political]] values. Since the twenty-first century, the term has been widely associated with [[University of California, Berkeley]] sociologist [[Michael Burawoy]], who delivered an impassioned call for a disciplinary embrace of public sociology in his 2004 [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA) presidential address.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his address, Burawoy contrasts public sociology with what he terms "professional sociology", a form of sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other academic sociologists.

Burawoy and other advocates of public sociology encourage the discipline to engage with issues that are of significant public and political concern. These include debates over public policy, political [[activism]], the purposes of [[social movements]], and the institutions of [[civil society]]. If public sociology is considered to be a "movement" within the discipline, it is one that aims to revitalize the discipline of sociology by leveraging its [[empirical]] methods and theoretical insights to contribute to debates not just about ''what is'' or ''what has been'' in society, but about what society ''might yet be''. Thus, many versions of public sociology have had an undeniably [[Norm (sociology)|normative]]&lt;ref&gt;Hanemaayer, A., &amp; Schneider, C.J. (eds) (2014).

==History==
The term "public sociology" was first introduced by [[Herbert Gans]] in his 1988 ASA presidential address, "Sociology in America: The Discipline and the Public".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gans|first=Herbert J.|date=1989-01-01|title=Sociology in America: The Discipline and the Public American Sociological Association, 1988 Presidential Address|jstor=2095658|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=54|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.2307/2095658}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Gans, primary examples of public sociologists included [[David Riesman]], author of ''The Lonely Crowd'' (one of the best-selling books of sociology ever to be written), and [[Robert Bellah]], the lead author of another best-selling work, ''Habits of the Heart''. In 2000 (four years before Burawoy's ASA address), sociologist [[Ben Agger]] wrote the book ''Public Sociology: From Social Facts to Literary Acts,'' which called for a sociology that addressed major public issues.

However, the [[Northwestern University]] race scholar [[Aldon Morris]] argues in his book ''The Scholar Denied: W. E. B. Du Bois and the Birth of Modern Sociology'' (2015) that [[W. E. B. Du Bois|W. E .B. Du Bois]] was practicing public sociology long before the term was incorporated into the mainstream disciplinary vocabulary, and that [[scientific racism]] prevented Du Bois' contributions from being recognized by the discipline for nearly a century.

Morris argues that Du Bois built the first actual scientific department of sociology during his tenure at [[Atlanta University]], a historically black college, predating the "scientific revolution" of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] (who are often credited with turning sociology into a rigorous, empirical social science).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scholar Denied: W. E. B. Du Bois and the Birth of Modern Sociology|last=Morris|first=Aldon|publisher=University of California Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~lutters/pubs/1996_SWLNote96-1_Lutters,Ackerman.pdf|title=An Introduction to the Chicago School of Sociology|last=Lutters|first=Wayne G.|last2=Ackerman|first2=Mark S.|date=1996|website=|publisher=University of Maryland, Baltimore County|access-date=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Du Bois, robust empirical sociological research was necessary in order to emancipate American blacks from the tyrannies and oppressions built into the racist fabric of American society. Through thorough [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] research, Du Bois sought to dismantle and delegitimize [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]], biological, and cultural deficiency explanations for racial inequality, which were ''not'' grounded in empirical evidence, but relied on grand [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] narratives that had no basis in scientific analysis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Du Bois and his colleagues made use of the scientific method and robust empirical inquiry with the dual goal of turning sociology into a ''real'' social science committed to empirical investigation, and using their findings to liberate, empower, and emancipate American blacks from the violence of racist oppression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, long before Gans or Burawoy began emphasizing the virtues of public sociology, Du Bois had been serving a marginalized public through his scholarly research, failing to receive credit where credit was due.

Debates over public sociology have rekindled questions concerning the extra-academic ''purpose'' of [[sociology]]. Public sociology raises questions about what sociology is and what its goals ought to (or even could) be. Such debates (over science and political advocacy, scholarship and public commitment) have a long history in American sociology and in American social science more generally. Historian Mark C. Smith, for instance, has investigated earlier debates over the purpose of social science in his book ''Social Science in the Crucible: The American Debate over Objectivity and Purpose,1918-1941'' (1994), while Stephen P. Turner and Jonathan H. Turner argue in their book, ''The Impossible Science: An Institutional Analysis of American Sociology'' (1990), that sociology's search for purpose, through dependence on external publics, has limited the discipline's potential.

==Today==
While there is no one definition of public sociology, the term has come to be widely associated with Burawoy's particular perspective of sociology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An excerpt from Burawoy's 2004 ASA presidential address provides a succinct summary of his understanding of the term: &lt;blockquote&gt;"As mirror and conscience of society, sociology must define, promote and inform public debate about deepening [[Social class|class]] and racial inequalities, new gender regimes, [[environmental degradation]], [[market fundamentalism]], state and non-state violence. I believe that the world needs public sociology - a sociology that transcends the academy - more than ever. Our potential publics are multiple, ranging from [[Mass media|media]] audiences to policy makers, from silenced minorities to social movements. They are local, global, and national. As public sociology stimulates debate in all these contexts, it inspires and revitalizes our discipline. In return, theory and research give legitimacy, direction, and substance to public sociology. Teaching is equally central to public sociology: students are our first public for they carry sociology into all walks of life. Finally, the critical imagination, exposing the gap between what is and what could be, infuses values into public sociology to remind us that the world could be different."&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, M. 2004 American Sociological Association Presidential address: For public sociology. ''American Sociological Review'', 2005, Vol. 70, Issue 1, 4-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Elsewhere, Burawoy has articulated a vision of public sociology that is consonant with the pursuit of [[democratic socialism]]. In ''Critical Sociology'', Burawoy writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"We might say that critical engagement with real [[utopias]] is today an integral part of the project of sociological socialism. It is a vision of socialism that places human society, or social humanity at its organizing center, a vision that was central to [[Karl Marx|Marx]] but that was too often lost before it was again picked up by Gramsci and Polanyi. If public sociology is to have a progressive impact it will have to hold itself continuously accountable to some such vision of democratic socialism."&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, Michael: "The Critical Turn to Public Sociology", ''Critical Sociology'', Summer 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As [[Mark D. Jacobs]] and [[Amy Best]] write, "The mission of public sociology, in Michael Burawoy’s formulation, is to strengthen the institutions of civil society against the encroachments of both state and market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mayjun08/mason.html|title=Footnotes--May/June 2008 Issue--George Mason Introduces New PhD Program in Public Sociology|website=www.asanet.org|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Burawoy maintains that, since the last half of the twentieth century and into the twenty first, the political stance of sociology has drifted more [[Left-wing politics|leftward]], while the all encompassing influence of [[neoliberalism]] has dragged the rest of world more [[Right-wing politics|rightward]]. In the aftermath of [[Reaganomics]], the state and market have begun to work in collusion to propagate the ideals of market fundamentalism, replacing the state's role in redistributing resources and providing social welfare services, to one of creating economic opportunities for enterprise. In his view, this will have devastating consequences for civil society, the very subject of sociology itself, unless the discipline embraces his call to unashamedly engage with the world's diverse (and at-risk) publics to achieve some greater good, thus resisting the perverse allure of neoliberalism. One example of this can be seen in the vast increase in adjunct professors in universities and the impact that has had on the inability of professors to publish articles that would give them credence in the eyes of not only publics but also within the discipline itself.

Even in the face of such adversity, many sociologists remain optimistic about the potential latent within sociology to develop an alternative paradigm to the market fundamentalism at the heart of Burawoy's critique. The sociological discipline is dynamic and ever changing, and has a long history of incorporating new theoretical and empirical insights into its analyses, often with the goal of empowering marginalized publics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=Daniel|title=Understanding Society|journal=Sociology as a Social Science Discipline|date=November 9, 2007|pages=1|url=http://understandingsociety.blogspot.ca/2007/11/sociology-as-social-science-discipline.html|accessdate=November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the sociology of work has evolved from processes of adaptation to the study of domination and [[Labour movement|labor movements]]; the concepts of [[Social stratification|stratification theory]] have shifted from the study of mobility within a hierarchy of occupational prestige, to the examination of changing structures of social and economic inequality along the axes of class, race and gender; the sociology of race has moved from theories of [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]], to those of [[political economy]], to the study of [[Racial formation theory|racial formations]]; and social theory has allowed, and introduced, more radical interpretations of canonical figures such as [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]], and [[Karl Marx]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} and has incorporated "[[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]]" subfields, such as [[feminism]] and [[ethnic studies]], which have had a significant impact on the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Sociology: Fifteen Eminent Sociologists Debate Politics and the Profession in the Twenty-first Century|last=Glenn|first=Evelyn Nakano|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=213–230|chapter=Whose Public Sociology?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists have not been alone in debating the public role of social science. Similar debates have occurred recently in the disciplines of [[economics]], [[political science]], [[anthropology]], [[geography]] and [[history]], and various sub-disciplines, including [[political ecology]]. In an effort to move these various disciplines "toward a more public social science", [[Craig Calhoun]], the President of the [[Social Science Research Council]], has encouraged sociologists and other social scientists to "ask better social science questions about what encourages [[scientific]] innovation, what makes [[knowledge]] useful, and how to pursue both these agendas, with attention to both immediate needs and long-term capacities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssrc.org/programs/calhoun/ ssrc.org] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416003140/http://www.ssrc.org/programs/calhoun/ |date=2013-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calhoun has also entered the debate about public sociology, critically evaluating the project of public sociology while acknowledging its specific "promise", and arguing that "how sociology matters in the public sphere is vital to the future of the field".&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, C. 2004 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2005.00065.x/full "The promise of public sociology"]. ''The British Journal of Sociology'', 2005, Vol. 56, Issue 3, 355-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Following the 2004 annual meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA), at which Michael Burawoy's vision of public sociology was introduced during his presidential address,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burawoy|first=Michael|date=2005|title=For Public Sociology|url=http://burawoy.berkeley.edu/Public%20Sociology,%20Live/Burawoy.pdf|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=70|pages=4–28|doi=10.1177/000312240507000102|pmid=|access-date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been continued interest in the topic. In recent years, numerous books and special issues have addressed public sociology, including:

Building on the conversation sparked by Burawoy in 2004, the 2007 ASA meeting in New York City contained many facets of public sociology. Many of the presentations engaged directly with the public sociology debate, such as: "Constituting a Practical Public Sociology: Reflections on Participatory Research at the Citizenship Project"&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Paul. [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p185050_index.html "Constituting a Practical Public Sociology: Reflections on Participatory Research at the Citizenship Project"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, TBA, New York, New York City, Aug 11, 2007. 2011-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; by Paul Johnston; "A New Public Sociology of Punishment"&lt;ref&gt;Schoenfeld, Heather. [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p184842_index.html "1. A New Public Sociology of Punishment"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association (ASA), TBA, New York, New York City, Aug 11, 2007. 2011-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; by Heather Schoenfeld; "What Do Activists Want?

Lambros Fatsis' doctoral thesis on public sociology, [http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/51588/ "Making Sociology Public: A Critical Analysis of an Old Idea and a Recent Debate"], can also be recommended as a critical review of the contemporary disciplinary debate about public sociology, incorporating such developments as "e-public sociology" into the scholarly discussion. E-public sociology is a form of public sociology that involves publishing sociological materials in online accessible spaces and subsequent interaction with publics in these spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, C.J. (2014). Social Media and e-Public Sociology. In Ariane Hanemaayer and [[Christopher J. Schneider]], editors, The Public Sociology Debate: Ethics and Engagement, University of British Columbia Press: 205-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate over public sociology is having far reaching consequences for how many sociology departments teach and ''do'' sociology, with several reorienting their programs to encompass elements of public sociology. For example, the sociology department at the [[University of Minnesota]] has begun advocating for sociology to claim a larger role in public life, providing "useful, accurate, and scientifically rigorous information to policy makers and community leaders".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/nov04/fn14.html "The Engaged Department: Public Sociology in the Twin Cities"] by Ronald Aminzade, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Footnotes nov. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at [[George Mason University]] began offering a doctoral degree in sociology in the fall of 2008, grounding its two specializations in Institutions and Inequalities and the Sociology of Globalization within a context of public sociological praxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mayjun08/mason.html|title=Footnotes--May/June 2008 Issue--George Mason Introduces New PhD Program in Public Sociology|website=www.asanet.org|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], too, most institutions that provide undergraduate sociology degrees now advertise the public or "applied" nature of the curriculum (or various key modules that form part of the curriculum). Some examples here would include: [[Birmingham City University]]; [[Queen Margaret University|Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh]]; [[Nottingham Trent University]]; the [[University of Exeter]]; [[Cardiff University]]; and [[Bishop Grosseteste University]]'s newly established [https://web.archive.org/web/20160113173152/http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/study/courses/Pages/sociology.aspx BA Sociology program].

Indeed, with so many programs incorporating the ideals of public sociology into their curriculums, this will have significant consequences for how future sociologists are trained to ''do'' sociology.

==Criticism==
A significant number of those who practice sociology either as public intellectuals or as academic professionals do not subscribe to the specific version of "public sociology" defended by Michael Burawoy or to any version of "public sociology" at all. And in the wake of Burawoy's 2004 Presidency of the American Sociological Association, which put the theme of public sociology in the limelight, the project of public sociology has been vigorously debated on the web, in conversations among sociologists, and in a variety of academic journals.

Specifically, Burawoy's vision of public sociology has been critiqued both by "[[Critical theory|critical]]" sociologists and by representatives of academic sociology. These various discussions of public sociology have been included in forums devoted to the subject in [[academic journal]]s such as ''Social Problems'', ''Social Forces'', ''Critical Sociology'', and the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20051125044631/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/BURAWOY/workingpapers.htm].

Public sociology faces fierce criticism on the grounds of both of its logic and its goals.  Its critics claim that it is based on a [[false premise]] of consensus in the sociological community, arguing that "it greatly overestimates the uniformity of the moral and political agenda of sociologists".&lt;ref name="nielsen"&gt;Francois Nielsen. 2004. "The Vacant 'We': Remarks on Public Sociology."  Social Forces, Vol. 82, No. 4 (Jun., 2004), pp. 1619-1627&lt;/ref&gt;  They question the possibility and the desirability of such moral agreement, pointing out that "almost every social issue involves moral dilemmas, not moral clarity. What is or is not 'just' is almost never unambiguous".&lt;ref name="tittle"/&gt;  Others argue that public sociology is based on an uncritical and overly idealistic perception of the public sphere.&lt;ref name="brady"&gt;Brady, David. 2004. "Why Public Sociology May Fail."  ''Social Forces'', Vol. 82, No. 4 (Jun., 2004), pp. 1629-1638&lt;/ref&gt; Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. Sociological Spectrum. 36 (3). P. 183-190. DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2015.1102666&lt;/ref&gt; argues that public sociology relies on a dialectical, unilineal evolutionary view of social change. If a public sociologist assumes a multi-lineal interpretation of social change, public sociology will fail to affect social change for three reasons: (1) there's no objective criteria for the assessment of different goals (2) the rejection of one goal does not necessarily lead to an adherence to some other particular goal and (3) criticizing a goal maintains its relevance at the expense of possible alternatives.

Even stronger critiques come from academics who believe that the program of public sociology will unduly politicize the discipline and thus endanger the legitimacy sociology has in the public dialogue.&lt;ref name="tittle"&gt;Tittle, Charles. 2004. [http://cooley.ad.wsu.edu/schwartj/pdf/PublicSoc.pdf "The Arrogance of Public Sociology"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Social Forces'', June 2004, 82(4).&lt;/ref&gt;  These critics argue that the project of building a reliable body of knowledge about society is fundamentally incompatible with the goals of public sociology: "To the extent that we orient our work around moral principles, we are less likely to attend to theoretical issues. The greater the extent to which we favor particular outcomes, the less able are we to design our work to actually access such outcomes. And the more ideologically oriented our objectives, the less the chance that we can recognize or assimilate contrary evidence. In other words, rather than good professional sociology being mutually interactive with public sociology, I believe that public sociology gets in the way of good professional sociology."&lt;ref name="tittle"/&gt;

One outspoken critic of public sociology was sociologist [[Mathieu Deflem]] of the [[University of South Carolina]], who wrote various papers against public sociology and argued that public sociology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"is neither public nor sociology. Public sociology is not a plea to make sociology more relevant to the many publics in society nor to connect sociology democratically to political activity. Of course sociologists should be public intellectuals. But they should be and can only be public intellectuals as practitioners of the science they practice, not as activists left or right. Yet public sociology instead is a quest to subsume sociology under politics, a politics of a specific kind, not in order to foster sociological activism but to narrow down the sociological discipline to activist sociology."&lt;ref&gt;[http://deflem.blogspot.com/2004/08/letter-to-editor-proper-role-of.html Deflem, Mathieu. 2004. "The Proper Role of Sociology in the World at Large" (letter to the editor), ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', October 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In opposition to public sociology, Deflem used to maintain the website, [http://www.savesociology.org/ SaveSociology.org].

==Applied sociology==

"Applied sociology" and "sociological practice" (also referred to as [[policy sociology]]) has come to refer to [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] using sociological knowledge in an applied setting. Applied sociologists work in a wide variety of settings including universities, government, and private practice, using sociological methods to help communities solve everyday problems, such as improving community policing and crime prevention, evaluating and improving drug courts, assessing the needs of [[inner city]] neighborhoods, developing the capacity of an educational system, or promoting the development of housing and related resources for aging populations.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Roger A, ''Preface'' in Price, Jammie, Straus, Roger and Breese, Jeffrey, editors, ''In Doing Sociology. Case Studies in Sociological Practice'', [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] (2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7391-3395-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociological practice is different from pure academic sociology in which sociologists work in an academic setting such as a university with a teaching and pure research orientation. Although there are some common origins, sociological practice is entirely distinct from [[social work]].&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Roger A, ''Using Sociology: An Introduction From The Applied and Clinical Perspectives'' Third Edition. Rowman &amp; Littlefield (2002), {{ISBN|0-7425-1662-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of universities are attempting to gear curricula toward practical sociology in this way. Clinical sociology courses give students the skills to be able to work effectively with clients, teach basic [[counseling]] skills, give knowledge that is useful for careers such as victims assisting and drug rehabilitation, and teach the student how to integrate sociological knowledge with other fields they may go into such as marriage and family therapy, and clinical social work.

As defined by the Applied Social Sciences Forum (ASSF), applied Social Science (ASS) seeks to highlight the processes of social and political transformation taking place in a particular society. It is characterized by the operational aspect of the knowledge it produces. Unlike pure academic knowledge, applied social sciences try to steer the debate towards scientific priorities of social and political reform and accompanying social transformations. From this point of view, the applied social sciences can be seen as complementary knowledge that enrich both the action and the academic sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assforum.org The Applied Social Science Forum website - assforum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of ASS are to deepen reflection on practical issues related to their objective, to support the major decision making in society and enable researchers to support their knowledge and enrich the range of possible solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Abdelwahab Ben Hafaiedh: The Applied Social Science today - Tunisian Association of Sociology - Tunis 2001 p 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The "action research" is the framework of choice for applied social sciences. Action research can be defined here as a process that involves further intervention by the researcher beyond the return of a single diagnostic assay type, or inventory.

The researcher may, in this way, have several hats within the same search:
* A role of developer issues, logical actions and issues of different actors,
* An expert who accompanies the action from his methodology and science role
* A facilitator role pilot working groups and aims, as and when the progress of its work, its analyzes to confront the realities of stakeholders power feed, 
* A mediator who brings out back and speak different stakeholders of an action system
* A role of facilitator who can help build collective courses of action relevant while remaining outside issues discussed.

The methodological tools of the SSA are:
* Qualitative approaches (different types of interviews and / or collective)
* Quantitative methods using questionnaires and / or literature searches, data processing statistics
* The analysis of practices
* Action research
* Participatory methods

'''Pure alexia''', also known as '''agnosic alexia''' or '''alexia without agraphia''' or '''pure word blindness''', is one form of [[Alexia (condition)|alexia]] which makes up "the peripheral dyslexia" group.&lt;ref name="Acquired dyslexia"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Coslett HB |title=Acquired dyslexia |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=419–26 |year=2000 |pmid=11149697 |doi=10.1055/s-2000-13174 |url=https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2000-13174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have pure alexia have severe reading problems while other language-related skills such as naming, oral repetition, auditory comprehension or writing are typically intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Behrmann M, Shomstein SS, Black SE, Barton JJ |title=The eye movements of pure alexic patients during reading and nonreading tasks |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=983–1002 |year=2001 |pmid=11516450 |doi=10.1016/S0028-3932(01)00021-5 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Pure alexia results from cerebral lesions in circumscribed brain regions and therefore belongs to the group of acquired reading disorders, [[Alexia (condition)|alexia]],&lt;ref name="Acquired dyslexia"/&gt; as opposed to [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]] found in children who have difficulties in learning to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Temple CM |title=Developmental and acquired dyslexias |journal=Cortex |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=898–910 |date=August 2006 |pmid=17131596 |doi=10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70434-9 |url=http://www.cortexjournal.net/article/S0010-9452%2808%2970434-9/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Pure alexia almost always involves an infarct to the left [[posterior cerebral artery]] (which perfuses the [[splenium of the corpus callosum]] and left [[visual cortex]], among other things). The resulting deficit will be pure alexia – i.e., the patient can write but cannot read (even what they have just written).  However, because pure alexia affects visual input, not auditory input, patients with pure alexia can recognize words that are spelled out loud to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Neil R.|title=Physiology of behavior|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston|isbn=0-205-23939-0|page=501|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the left visual cortex has been damaged, leaving only the right visual cortex ([[occipital lobe]]) able to process visual information, but it is unable to send this information to the language areas ([[Broca's area]], [[Wernicke's area]], etc.) in the left brain because of the damage to the [[splenium]] of the corpus callosum. Patients with this deficit mostly do have a stroke to the posterior cerebral artery. But they may be susceptible to pure alexia as a consequence of other traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) as well. Anything that stops proper blood flow to the area necessary for normal reading abilities will cause a form of alexia.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P.

It also supplies the anterior temporal branches, the posterior temporal branches, the calcarrine branch, and the parieto-occipital branch.&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R.|title= Visual Attention in Posterior Stroke and Relations to Alexia |journal= Neuropsychologia |date=2015 |doi=10.1044/2015_JSLHR-L-14-0286 |url= |volume=58 |page=1521|pmc=4686312}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is important about these arteries is their location. All of them supply blood to the back outer parts of the brain.&lt;ref name="Imaging"&gt;{{cite web|title=Imaging|url= http://ophthalmology.stanford.edu/blog/archives/imaging/ |date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the brain is also referred to as the posterior lateral part of the brain. In cases of pure alexia, locations are found in the section of the brain, specifically the temporo-occipital area.&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"/&gt; This is the area that is activated when people without any sort of alexia receive activation when undergoing orthographic processing. This area is known as the visual word form area due to this pattern of activation.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt;

These people typically adapt to their disability and are able to use a style of compensatory reading known as letter-by-letter reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexia|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/friedmar/alexia.html|website=Cognitive Neuropsychology Laboratory|publisher=Center for Aphasia Research and Rehabilitation|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of reading takes longer than the conventional style of reading does. As the number of letters in a word increases, the amount of time it takes for the person with pure alexia increases. For each letter that is added, a patient may take up to an additional three seconds to read the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montant|first1=Marie|last2=Behrmann|first2=Marlene|title=Pure Alexia|journal=Neurocase|date=2000|volume=6|pages=265–294|url=https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~behrmann/dlpapers/MontantBehrmann.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2015|doi=10.1080/13554790008402777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that pure alexia may be a result of a disconnection syndrome. Analysis of diffusion images showed that the visual word form area (VWFA) is connected to the occipital lobe via the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), a projection that runs between the temporal and occipital lobe. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) showed that two weeks after surgery in the ILF, the VWFA-Occipital Lobe tract was severely degenerated. The results came from an epileptic patient who showed symptoms of pure alexia after his surgery. Thus, the proposed pathophysiological mechanism is that the ILF lesion interferes with transmission of visual information to the VWFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epelbaum|first1=S.|title=Pure alexia as a disconnection syndrome: New diffusion imaging evidence for an old concept|journal=Cortex|date=2008|volume=44|issue=8|pages=962–974|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2008.05.003|pmid=18586235}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, an alternative view that suggests the "VWFA" is devoted to processing of high acuity foveal input, which is particularly salient for complex visual stimuli like letter strings. Studies have highlighted disrupted processing of non-linguistic visual stimuli after damage to the left pFG, both for familiar and unfamiliar objects &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=DJ|last2=Woollams|first2=AM|last3=Kim|first3=E|last4=Beeson|first4=PM|last5=Rapcsak|first5=SZ|last6=Lambon Ralph|first6=MA|title=Efficient Visual Object and Word Recognition Relies on High Spatial Frequency Coding in the Left Posterior Fusiform Gyrus: Evidence from a Case-Series of Patients with Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex Damage|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=24 August 2012|volume=23|issue=11|pages=2568–2580|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhs224|pmid=22923086|pmc=3792736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=DJ|last2=Lambon Ralph|first2=MA|last3=Kim|first3=ES|last4=Tainturier|first4=MJ|last5=Beeson|first5=PM|last6=Rapcsak|first6=SZ|last7=Woollams|first7=AM|title=Processing deficits for familiar and novel faces in patients with left posterior fusiform lesions|journal=Cortex|date=November 2015|volume=72|pages=79–96|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2015.02.003|pmid=25837867|pmc=4643682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure alexia exhibits some unexpected residual abilities despite the inability to read words. For instance, one patient had preserved calculation capabilities such as deciding which number was greater, and whether a number was odd or even with greater than chance probability. The study showed that the patient was also able to calculate simple arithmetic tasks such as addition, subtraction, and division, but not multiplication, even though the patient could not read the numbers. For example, the patient would be presented with "8 – 6", and he or she would read it as "five minus four", but still come up with the correct answer "two" with greater than chance accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=L.|title=Calculating Without Reading: Unsuspected Residual Abilities In Pure Alexia|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=2000|volume=17|issue=6|pages=563–583|accessdate=|doi=10.1080/02643290050110656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure alexia patients also seem to retain some residual semantic processing. They are able to perform better than chance when forced to make a lexical decision or make a semantic-categorisation decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=DJ|last2=Lambon Ralph|first2=MA|last3=Woollams|first3=AM|title=When does less yield more?

However, this may be due to right hemisphere input or residual left hemisphere input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coslett|first1=H.B.|title=Evidence For Preserved Reading In ‘Pure Alexia’|journal=Brain|date=1989|volume=112|issue=2|pages=327–359|accessdate=|doi=10.1093/brain/112.2.327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In patients, a common symptom is letter-by-letter reading or LBL. This action is a compensatory strategy which these patients use in order to come up with a semblance of reading.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt; It is essentially looking at the consonants and vowels of the word and sounding them out as they sound. However, this method does not always work, especially for words like 'phone' where the ph sounds like an f, but if sounded out, does not sound like an f. Also, by reading words in the fashion, the rate at which patients read words is much slower compared to people who do not have this disability. Petersen et al. proved that the issue of reading time had more to do with the length of the words than reading ability. The team had 4 patients with right hemisphere damage and 4 patients with left hemisphere damage in the temporo-occipital lobes as well as 26 controls were shown one word at a time on a screen. They were exposed to 20 words of 3 and 5 letters, 12 words of 7 letters. The subjects were asked to read the words as quickly and as accurately as possible. The patients with left hemisphere lesions consistently read the longer words slower than the controls despite the difficulty of the word.&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"/&gt; It is thought that as the word gets longer, the letters on the outsides of the word go into peripheral vision, making the patient shift their attention thus making the patient take longer to read.

==Rehabilitation==
Though there have been ample attempts to rehabilitate patients with pure alexia, few have proven to be effective on a large scale. Most rehabilitation practices have been specialized to a single patient or small patient group. At the simplest level, patients seeking rehabilitation are asked to practice reading words aloud repeatedly. This is meant to stimulate the damaged system of the brain. This is known as multiple oral re-reading (MOR) treatment. This is a text-based approach that is implemented in order to prevent patients from LBL reading. MOR works by reading aloud the same text repeatedly until certain criteria are reached.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt; The most important criteria for a pure alexic patient is reading at an improved rate. The treatment aims to shift patients away from the LBL reading strategy by strengthening links between visual input and the associated orthographic representations. This repetition supports the idea of using top-down processing initially minimize the effects peripheral processing which were demonstrated in the study above.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Imaging"/&gt; From here, the goal is to increase bottom-up processing. This will hopefully aid in word recognition and promote interactive processing of all available information to support reading. 'The supported reading stimulation from MOR has a rehabilitative effect so that reading rate and accuracy are better for untrained text, and word-form recognition improves as evidenced by a reduced word-length effect.'&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"/&gt; These tactics have seen quite good success. 
Another tactic that has been employed is the use of cross modal therapy. In this therapy, patients are asked to trace the words in which they are trying to read aloud. There has been success using cross modal therapy such as kinaesthetic or motor-cross cuing therapy, but tends to be a more feasible approach for those on the slower reading end of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leff|first1=Alexander P.|last2=Schofield|first2=T.

'''Social life''' is the least defined and least understood of the different ways of approaching [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]]. Social sustainability has had considerably less attention in public dialogue than economic and environmental sustainability.

There are several approaches to sustainability. The first, which posits a triad of environmental sustainability, [[economic sustainability]], and social sustainability, is the most widely accepted as a model for addressing sustainability.  The concept of "social sustainability" in this approach encompasses such topics as: [[social equity]], [[livability]], [[health equity]], [[community development]], [[social capital]], [[social support]], [[human rights]], [[labour rights]], [[placemaking]], [[social responsibility]], [[social justice]], [[cultural competence]], community resilience, and human adaptation.

A second, more recent, approach suggests that all of the domains of sustainability are social: including ecological, economic, political and cultural sustainability. These domains of social sustainability are all dependent upon the relationship between the social and the natural, with the "ecological domain" defined as human embeddedness in the environment. In these terms, social sustainability encompasses all human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not just relevant to the focussed intersection of economics, the environment and the social.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2013 |author1=Liam Magee |author2=Andy Scerri |author3=Paul James |author4=James A.

==Definitions==

According to the Western Australia Council of Social Services (WACOSS):&lt;ref&gt;[http://auspsa.anu.edu.au/proceedings/publications/Partridgepaper.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Social sustainability occurs when the formal and informal processes; systems; structures; and relationships actively support the capacity of current and future generations to create healthy and liveable communities. Socially sustainable communities are equitable, diverse, connected and democratic and provide a good quality of life."''

Another definition has been developed by Social Life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.social-life.co/ http://www.social-life.co]&lt;/ref&gt; a UK-based social enterprise specialising in place-based innovation. They define social sustainability as "''a process for creating sustainable, successful places that promote wellbeing, by understanding what people need from the places they live and work. Social sustainability combines design of the physical realm with design of the social world – infrastructure to support social and cultural life, social amenities, systems for citizen engagement and space for people and places to evolve''."&lt;ref name="social-life.co"&gt;[http://www.social-life.co/media/files/DESIGN_FOR_SOCIAL_SUSTAINABILITY_3.pdf S.Woodcraft et al (2011) Design for Social Sustainability, Social Life, London]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions==

Social Life have developed a framework for social sustainability&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.social-life.co/publication/Social-Sustainability/]&lt;/ref&gt;  which has four dimensions: amenities and infrastructure, social and cultural life, voice and influence, and space to grow.&lt;ref name="social-life.co"/&gt;

Nobel Laureate [[Amartya Sen]] gives the following dimensions for social sustainability:&lt;ref&gt;[http://integral-sustainability.net/wp-content/uploads/sas4-2-hodgson.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Equity''' - the community provides equitable opportunities and outcomes for all its members, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable members of the community
*'''Diversity''' - the community promotes and encourages diversity
*'''Interconnected/Social cohesions''' - the community provides processes, systems and structures that promote connectedness within and outside the community at the formal, informal and institutional level
*'''Quality of life''' - the community ensures that basic needs are met and fosters a good quality of life for all members at the individual, group and community level (e.g. health, housing, education, employment, safety)
*'''Democracy and governance''' - the community provides democratic processes and open and accountable governance structures.
*'''Maturity''' - the individual accept the responsibility of consistent growth and improvement through broader social attributes (e.g. communication styles, behavioural patterns, indirect education and philosophical explorations)

Also we can speak of Sustainable Human Development that can be seen as development that promotes the capabilities of present people without compromising capabilities of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, A.K. (2000) ‘The ends and means of sustainability’, keynote address at the International Conference on Transition to sustainability, Tokyo, May&lt;/ref&gt; In the human development paradigm, environment and natural resources should constitute a means of achieving better standards of living just as income represents a means of increasing social expenditure and, in the end, well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Anand, S. and Sen, A.K. (1996) ‘Sustainable human development: concepts and priorities’, Office of Development Studies Discussion Paper, No. 1, UNDP, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The different aspects of social sustainability are often considered in [[socially responsible investing]] (SRI). Social sustainability criteria that are commonly used by SRI funds and indexes to rate publicly traded companies include: community, diversity, employee relations, human rights, product safety, reporting, and governance structure.&lt;ref&gt;KLD Research. Environmental, Social and Governance Rating Criteria. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Combined Code on Corporate Governance, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49245">'''Sterilization''' (or '''sterilization''') refers to any process that eliminates, removes, kills, or deactivates all forms of [[life]] and other [[biological agent]]s (such as [[fungi]], [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, spore forms, [[prion]]s, [[unicellular]] [[eukaryotic]] organisms such as [[Plasmodium]], etc.) present in a specified region, such as a surface, a volume of fluid, medication, or in a compound such as biological [[growth medium|culture media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/MSM_98_4/MSM_98_4_glossary.en.html|title=WHO Glossary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/anthapha_def_a.html|title=Definitions|first=Ralph R.|last=Frerichs|website=www.ph.ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterilization can be achieved through various means, including: [[heat]], [[chemical]]s, [[irradiation]], [[high pressure food preservation|high pressure]], and [[filtration]]. Sterilization is not distinct from [[disinfection]], sanitization, and [[pasteurization]], in that sterilization kills, deactivates, or eliminates all forms of life and other biological agents which are present.

==Applications==

===Foods===
One of the first steps toward sterilization was made by [[Nicolas Appert]] who discovered that thorough application of heat over a suitable period slowed the decay of foods and various liquids, preserving them for safe consumption for a longer time than was typical. [[Canning]] of foods is an extension of the same principle and has helped to reduce [[food borne illness]] ("food poisoning"). Other methods of sterilizing foods include [[food irradiation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dkNQqbXY3loC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Food irradiation: principles and applications|last=Molins|first=Ricardo A.|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|page=23|isbn=978-0-471-35634-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and high pressure ([[pascalization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edPzm5KSMmYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Food: Principles and Preparation|last=Brown|first=Amy Christian|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|edition=3|isbn=978-0-495-10745-3|page=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine and surgery===
[[File:Joseph Lister c1855.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] was a pioneer of [[antiseptic#Usage in surgery|antiseptic surgery]].]]
[[File:Der Apparat zur Sterilisierung der Operationsinstrumente - CH-BAR - 3240236.tif|thumb|Apparatus to sterilize surgical instruments, Verwaltungsgebäude der Schweiz. Kranken- und Hilfsanstalt, 1914-1918]]

In general, surgical instruments and medications that enter an already [[Asepsis|aseptic]] part of the body (such as the bloodstream, or penetrating the skin) must be sterile. Examples of such instruments include [[scalpel]]s, [[hypodermic needle]]s, and [[artificial pacemaker]]s. This is also essential in the manufacture of [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] pharmaceuticals.

Preparation of injectable medications and intravenous solutions for [[fluid replacement]] therapy requires not only sterility but also well-designed containers to prevent entry of [[infection|adventitious agents]] after initial product sterilization.

Most medical and surgical devices used in healthcare facilities are made of materials that are able to go under [[steam]] sterilization. However, since 1950, there has been an increase in medical devices and instruments made of materials (e.g., plastics) that require low-temperature sterilization. [[Ethylene oxide]] gas has been used since the 1950s for heat- and moisture-sensitive medical devices. Within the past 15 years, a number of new, low-temperature sterilization systems (e.g., [[vaporized hydrogen peroxide]], [[peracetic acid]] immersion, [[ozone]]) have been developed and are being used to sterilize medical devices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/Disinfection_Sterilization/13_0Sterilization.html] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam sterilization is the most widely used and the most dependable. Steam sterilization is nontoxic, inexpensive, rapidly microbicidal, sporicidal, and rapidly heats and penetrates fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/Disinfection_Sterilization/13_0Sterilization.html#a1] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spacecraft===
There are strict international rules to [[planetary protection|protect the contamination of Solar System bodies]] from biological material from Earth. Standards vary depending on both the type of mission and its destination; the more likely a planet is considered to be [[planetary habitability|habitable]], the stricter the requirements are.

Many components of instruments used on spacecraft cannot withstand very high temperatures, so techniques not requiring excessive temperatures are used as tolerated, including heating to at least {{Cvt|120|C|}}, chemical sterilization, oxidization, ultraviolet, and irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sci.esa.int/home/30313-no-bugs-please-this-is-a-clean-planet/ |title=No bugs please, this is a clean planet! |publisher=European Space Agency |date=30 July 2002 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantification==
The aim of sterilization is the reduction of initially present microorganisms or other potential pathogens. The degree of sterilization is commonly expressed by multiples of the decimal reduction time, or [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]], denoting the time needed to reduce the initial number &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; to one tenth (&lt;math&gt;10^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;) of its original value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm071261.htm|title= Guidance for Industry: Biological Indicators|date= 4 October 2007|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the number of microorganisms &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; after sterilization time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{N_0}= 10^{\left(-\frac{t}{D}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;.
The D-value is a function of sterilization conditions and varies with the type of microorganism, [[temperature]], [[water activity]], [[pH]] etc.. For steam sterilization (see below) typically the temperature, in degrees [[Celsius]], is given as an index.

Theoretically, the likelihood of the survival of an individual microorganism is never zero. To compensate for this, the overkill method is often used. Using the overkill method, sterilization is performed by sterilizing for longer than is required to kill the [[bioburden]] present on or in the item being sterilized. This provides a [[sterility assurance level]] (SAL) equal to the probability of a non-sterile unit.

For high-risk applications, such as medical devices and injections, a sterility assurance level of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; is required by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070342.pdf|title= Guidance for Industry: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing|date= September 2004|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat==

===Steam===
{{See also|Moist heat sterilization}}

A widely used method for heat sterilization is the [[autoclave]], sometimes called a converter or steam sterilizer. Autoclaves use steam heated to {{Cvt|121–134|C|}} under [[pressure]]. To achieve sterility, the article is placed in a chamber and heated by injected steam until the article reaches a temperature and time setpoint. Almost all the air is removed from the chamber, because air is undesired in the moist heat sterilization process (this is one trait that differs from a typical pressure cooker used for food cooking). The article is held at the temperature setpoint for a period of time which varies depending on what [[bioburden]] is present on the article being sterilized and its resistance ([[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]]) to steam sterilization. A general cycle would be anywhere between 3 and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lso-inc.com/sterilization-validation-services/iso17665-steam-sterilization.html|title=Steam Sterilization for Medical Devices - ISO 17665 - Sterilization Validation Services|website=www.lso-inc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; at {{Cvt|121|C|}} at {{Cvt|100|kPa|}}, which is sufficient to provide a sterility assurance level of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; for a product with a bioburden of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and a D-value of 2.0 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sterislifesciences.com/sitecore/content/Sites/LifeSciences_com/Home/News-and-Events/News/2013/November/~/media/Files/LifeSciences_com/PDF/13ND-Dion.ashx|title= Steam Sterilization Principles|date= November 2013|accessdate= |website= |publisher= STERIS Life Sciences|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.

Proper autoclave treatment will inactivate all resistant bacterial [[spore]]s in addition to [[fungi]], bacteria, and viruses, but is not expected to eliminate all [[prion]]s, which vary in their resistance. For prion elimination, various recommendations state {{Cvt|121–132|C|}} for 60 minutes or {{Cvt|134|C|}} for at least 18 minutes.{{citation needed|date= April 2016}} The 263K [[scrapie]] prion is inactivated relatively quickly by such sterilization procedures; however, other strains of scrapie, and strains of [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (CKD) and [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) are more resistant. Using [[laboratory mouse|mice]] as test animals, one experiment showed that heating BSE positive [[brain]] tissue at {{Cvt|134–138|C|}} for 18 minutes resulted in only a 2.5 [[logarithm|log]] decrease in prion infectivity.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.tma.uz/gps/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/09/ASEPSIS-ANTISEPTICS-INTRODUCTION.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Most autoclaves have meters and charts that record or display information, particularly temperature and pressure as a function of time. The information is checked to ensure that the conditions required for sterilization have been met. [[Autoclave tape|Indicator tape]] is often placed on the packages of products prior to autoclaving, and some packaging incorporates indicators. The indicator changes color when exposed to steam, providing a visual confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/When_using_autoclave_we_use_autoclave_tape_which_changes_color_to_black_indicating_autoclaving_was_successful_what_is_the_molecular_mechanism|title=When using autoclave we use autoclave tape which changes color to black indicating autoclaving was successful, what is the molecular mechanism?|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bioindicators]] can also be used to independently confirm autoclave performance. Simple bioindicator devices are commercially available, based on microbial spores. Most contain spores of the heat-resistant microbe ''[[Geobacillus stearothermophilus]]'' (formerly ''Bacillus stearothermophilus''), which is extremely resistant to steam sterilization. Biological indicators may take the form of glass vials of spores and liquid media, or as spores on strips of paper inside [[glassine]] envelopes. These indicators are placed in locations where it is difficult for steam to reach to verify that steam is penetrating there.

For autoclaving, cleaning is critical. Extraneous biological matter or grime may shield organisms from steam penetration. Proper cleaning can be achieved through physical scrubbing, [[sonication]], [[ultrasound]], or pulsed air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decontamination and Sterilization|url=http://www.ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/BioSafety/decon/Pages/decontamination.aspx|website=NIH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pressure cooking]] and [[canning]] is analogous to autoclaving, and when performed correctly renders food sterile.

Moist heat causes the destruction of microorganisms by [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of macromolecules, primarily proteins. This method is a faster process than dry heat sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://biodifferences.com/difference-between-moist-heat-and-dry-heat-sterilization.html|title=Difference Between Moist Heat and Dry Heat Sterilization (with Comparison Chart) - Bio Differences|date=2018-02-22|work=Bio Differences|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dry heat===
{{See also|Dry heat sterilization}}

[[File:2003-12-03-Heissluft-Sterilisator.JPG|thumb|Dry heat sterilizer]]Dry heat was the first method of sterilization and is a longer process than moist heat sterilization. The destruction of microorganisms through the use of dry heat is a gradual phenomenon. With longer exposure to lethal temperatures, the number of killed microorganisms increases. Forced ventilation of hot air can be used to increase the rate at which heat is transferred to an organism and reduce the temperature and amount of time needed to achieve sterility. At higher temperatures, shorter exposure times are required to kill organisms. This can reduce heat-induced damage to food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casolari|first1=A.|title=FOOD STERILIZATION BY HEAT|url=http://www.vency.com/sterilization.html|website=Liberty Knowledge Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The standard setting for a hot air oven is at least two hours at {{Cvt|160|C|}}. A rapid method heats air to {{Cvt|190|C|}} for 6 minutes for unwrapped objects and 12 minutes for wrapped objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.ab.ca/resources/publications/PersonalServicesPt1.pdf |title=– Alberta Health and Wellness |publisher=Health.gov.ab.ca |access-date=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpub.com/content/medical/14274/css/14274_146.htm|title=Chemical Vapor Sterilization|website=www.tpub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry heat has the advantage that it can be used on powders and other heat-stable items that are adversely affected by steam (e.g. it does not cause rusting of steel objects).

===Flaming===
Flaming is done to [[Inoculation loop|inoculation loops]] and straight-wires in microbiology labs for [[Streaking (microbiology)|streaking]]. Leaving the loop in the flame of a [[Bunsen burner]] or [[alcohol burner]] until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see [[Sterilisation (microbiology)#Incineration|Incineration]] below). However, during the initial heating, infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. Another problem is that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in a 70% or more concentrated solution of [[ethanol]], then briefly touch the object to a [[Bunsen burner]] flame. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less residue than a gas flame.

===Incineration===
[[Incineration]] is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials. This method also burns any organism to ash. It is used to sterilize medical and other [[Biomedical waste|biohazardous waste]] before it is discarded with non-hazardous waste. Bacteria incinerators are mini furnaces that incinerate and kill off any microorganisms that may be on an inoculating loop or wire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Incineration]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tyndallization===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an obsolete and lengthy process designed to reduce the level of activity of sporulating bacteria that are left by a simple boiling water method. The process involves boiling for a period (typically 20 minutes) at atmospheric pressure, cooling, incubating for a day, and then repeating the process a total of three to four times. The incubation periods are to allow heat-resistant spores surviving the previous boiling period to germinate to form the heat-sensitive vegetative (growing) stage, which can be killed by the next boiling step. This is effective because many spores are stimulated to grow by the heat shock. The procedure only works for media that can support bacterial growth, and will not sterilize non-nutritive substrates like water. Tyndallization is also ineffective against prions.

===Glass bead sterilizers===
Glass bead sterilizers work by heating glass beads to {{Cvt|250|C|}}. Instruments are then quickly doused in these glass beads, which heat the object while physically scraping contaminants off their surface. Glass bead sterilizers were once a common sterilization method employed in [[dentistry|dental]] offices as well as biological laboratories,&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zadik Y, Peretz A |title=The effectiveness of glass bead sterilizer in the dental practice |journal=J Isr Dent Assoc |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=36–9 |date=Apr 2008 |pmid=18780544}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are not approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to be used as a sterilizers since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.CDC.gov/OralHealth/InfectionControl/faq/bead.htm 2008-09-11&lt;/ref&gt; They are still popular in [[Europe]]an and [[Israel]]i dental practices, although there are no current [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] guidelines for using this sterilizer.&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt;

==Chemical sterilization==
[[File:2003-12-03-Chemiclav.JPG|thumb|Chemiclav]]

Chemicals are also used for sterilization. Heating provides a reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, but it is not always appropriate if it will damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, [[fiber optic]]s, electronics, and many [[plastic]]s. In these situations chemicals, either in a gaseous or liquid form, can be used as sterilants. While the use of gas and liquid chemical sterilants avoids the problem of heat damage, users must ensure that the article to be sterilized is chemically compatible with the sterilant being used. In addition, the use of chemical sterilants poses new challenges for [[Workplace safety and health|workplace safety]], as the properties that make chemicals effective sterilants usually make them harmful to humans.

===Ethylene oxide===
[[Ethylene oxide]] (EO, EtO) gas treatment is one of the common methods used to sterilize, pasteurize, or disinfect items because of its wide range of material compatibility. It is also used to process items that are sensitive to processing with other methods, such as radiation (gamma, electron beam, X-ray), heat (moist or dry), or other chemicals. Ethylene oxide treatment is the most common chemical sterilization method, used for approximately 70% of total sterilizations, and for over 50% of all [[disposable]] medical devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/ethylene-oxide-factsheet.pdf|title=Ethylene oxide|last=|first=|date=|website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|publisher=OSHA|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethylene oxide treatment is generally carried out between {{Cvt|30 and 60|C|}} with [[relative humidity]] above 30% and a gas concentration between 200 and 800&amp;nbsp;mg/l.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naspco.com/sterilization/|title=Sterilization {{!}} NASP|website=North American Sterilization &amp; Packaging|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the process lasts for several hours. Ethylene oxide is highly effective, as it penetrates all [[porous materials]], and it can penetrate through some plastic materials and films. Ethylene oxide kills all known microorganisms, such as bacteria (including spores), viruses, and fungi (including yeasts and moulds), and is compatible with almost all materials even when repeatedly applied. It is flammable, toxic, and [[Carcinogen|carcinogenic]]; however, only with a reported potential for some adverse health effects when not used in compliance with published requirements. Ethylene oxide sterilizers and processes require biological [[validation (drug manufacturer)|validation]] after sterilizer installation, significant repairs or process changes.

The traditional process consists of a preconditioning phase (in a separate room or cell), a processing phase (more commonly in a vacuum vessel and sometimes in a pressure rated vessel), and an aeration phase (in a separate room or cell) to remove EO residues and lower by-products such as [[ethylene chlorohydrin]] (EC or ECH) and, of lesser importance, [[ethylene glycol]] (EG). An alternative process, known as all-in-one processing, also exists for some products whereby all three phases are performed in the vacuum or pressure rated vessel. This latter option can facilitate faster overall processing time and residue dissipation.

The most common EO processing method is the gas chamber method. To benefit from [[economies of scale]], EO has traditionally been delivered by filling a large chamber with a combination of gaseous EO either as pure EO, or with other gases used as diluents; diluents include chlorofluorocarbons ([[CFCs]]), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and [[carbon dioxide]].

Ethylene oxide is still widely used by medical device manufacturers. Since EO is explosive at concentrations above 3%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=730&amp;tid=133|title=ATSDR - Medical Management Guidelines (MMGs): Ethylene Oxide|website=www.atsdr.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; EO was traditionally supplied with an [[Inert gas|inert]] carrier gas, such as a CFC or HCFC. The use of CFCs or HCFCs as the carrier gas was banned because of concerns of [[ozone depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/Ozone/snap/sterilants/sterilants.pdf |title=Substitute Sterilants under SNAP as of September 28, 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Halogenated hydrocarbon|halogenated hydrocarbons]] are being replaced by systems using 100% EO, because of regulations and the high cost of the blends. In hospitals, most EO sterilizers use single-use cartridges because of the convenience and ease of use compared to the former plumbed gas cylinders of EO blends.

It is important to adhere to patient and healthcare personnel government specified limits of EO residues in and/or on processed products, operator exposure after processing, during storage and handling of EO gas cylinders, and environmental emissions produced when using EO.

The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) at 1 ppm – calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) – and 5 ppm as a 15-minute excursion limit (EL). The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]'s (NIOSH) immediately dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for EO is 800 ppm.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html |title=NIOSH: Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH) / NIOSH Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values (as of 3/1/95) - intridl4 |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Odor Threshold|odor threshold]] is around 500 ppm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MHMI/mmg137.html |title=ATSDR - MMG: Ethylene Oxide |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; so EO is imperceptible until concentrations are well above the OSHA PEL. Therefore, OSHA recommends that continuous gas monitoring systems be used to protect workers using EO for processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hospital/central/central.html |title=Hospital eTool: Central Supply Module |publisher=Osha.gov |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nitrogen dioxide===
[[Nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas is a rapid and effective sterilant for use against a wide range of microorganisms, including common bacteria, viruses, and spores. The unique physical properties of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas allow for sterilant dispersion in an enclosed environment at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The mechanism for lethality is the degradation of [[DNA]] in the spore core through [[nitration]] of the phosphate backbone, which kills the exposed organism as it absorbs NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This degradation occurs at even very low concentrations of the gas.&lt;ref&gt;Görsdorf S, Appel KE, Engeholm C, Obe G.; Nitrogen dioxide induces DNA single-strand breaks in cultured Chinese hamster cells: Carcinogenesis. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a boiling point of {{Cvt|21|C|}} at sea level, which results in a relatively highly saturated [[Vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] at ambient temperature. Because of this, liquid NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be used as a convenient source for the sterilant gas. Liquid NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is often referred to by the name of its [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Additionally, the low levels of concentration required, coupled with the high vapour pressure, assures that no [[condensation]] occurs on the devices being sterilized. This means that no aeration of the devices is required immediately following the sterilization cycle.&lt;ref name="Mechanism Overview, June 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mechanism Overview, June 2012|url=http://noxilizer.com/pdf/news/WhitePaper-Mechanism_Overview_6_14_12.pdf|work=noxilizer.com|publisher=Noxilizer, Inc.|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also less [[Corrosive substance|corrosive]] than other sterilant gases, and is compatible with most medical materials and adhesives.&lt;ref name="Mechanism Overview, June 2012"/&gt;

The most-resistant organism (MRO) to sterilization with NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas is the spore of [[Geobacillus stearothermophilus|''Geobacillus stearothermophilus'']], which is the same MRO for both steam and hydrogen peroxide sterilization processes. The spore form of ''G. stearothermophilus'' has been well characterized over the years as a [[biological indicator]] in sterilization applications. Microbial inactivation of ''G. stearothermophilus'' with NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas proceeds rapidly in a [[Log-linear graph|log-linear]] fashion, as is typical of other sterilization processes. Noxilizer, Inc. has commercialized this technology to offer contract sterilization services for [[medical devices]] at its Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.) facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noxilizer Contract Sterilization Services|url=http://noxilizer.com/services.php|work=noxilizer.com|publisher=Noxilizer, Inc.|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been demonstrated in Noxilizer’s lab in multiple studies and is supported by published reports from other labs. These same properties also allow for quicker removal of the sterilant and residual gases through aeration of the enclosed environment. The combination of rapid lethality and easy removal of the gas allows for shorter overall cycle times during the sterilization (or decontamination) process and a lower level of sterilant residuals than are found with other sterilization methods.&lt;ref name="Mechanism Overview, June 2012"/&gt;

===Ozone===
[[Ozone]] is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a disinfectant for surfaces. It has the benefit of being able to [[oxidize]] most organic matter. On the other hand, it is a toxic and unstable gas that must be produced on-site, so it is not practical to use in many settings.

Ozone offers many advantages as a sterilant gas; ozone is a very efficient sterilant because of its strong oxidizing properties ([[Oxidation number|E]]=2.076 vs [[Standard hydrogen electrode|SHE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 76th Ed|last= |first= |publisher= |year= 1995|isbn= |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) capable of destroying a wide range of pathogens, including prions, without the need for handling hazardous chemicals since the ozone is generated within the sterilizer from medical-grade [[oxygen]]. The high reactivity of ozone means that waste ozone can be destroyed by passing over a simple catalyst that reverts it to oxygen and ensures that the cycle time is relatively short. The disadvantage of using ozone is that the gas is very reactive and very hazardous. The NIOSH's immediately dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for ozone is {{nowrap|5 ppm,}} {{nowrap|160 times}} smaller than the {{nowrap|800 ppm}} IDLH for ethylene oxide. NIOSH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html|title=CDC - Index of Chemicals - NIOSH Publications and Products|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and OSHA has set the PEL for ozone at {{nowrap|0.1 ppm}}, calculated as an {{nowrap|eight-hour}} time-weighted average. The sterilant gas manufacturers include many safety features in their products but prudent practice is to provide continuous monitoring of exposure to ozone, in order to provide a rapid warning in the event of a leak. Monitors for determining workplace exposure to ozone are commercially available.

===Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde===

{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}

[[Glutaraldehyde]] and [[formaldehyde]] solutions (also used as [[fixation (histology)|fixatives]]) are accepted liquid sterilizing agents, provided that the immersion time is sufficiently long. To kill all spores in a clear liquid can take up to 22 hours with glutaraldehyde and even longer with formaldehyde. The presence of solid particles may lengthen the required period or render the treatment ineffective. Sterilization of blocks of tissue can take much longer, due to the time required for the fixative to penetrate. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are [[Volatile organic compound|volatile]], and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Glutaraldehyde has a short shelf-life (&lt;2 weeks), and is expensive. Formaldehyde is less expensive and has a much longer shelf-life if some [[methanol]] is added to inhibit [[polymerization]] to [[paraformaldehyde]], but is much more volatile. Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent; in this case, it is prepared on-site by depolymerization of solid paraformaldehyde. Many vaccines, such as the original [[Salk Polio Vaccine|Salk polio vaccine]], are sterilized with formaldehyde.

===Hydrogen peroxide===
[[Hydrogen peroxide]], in both liquid and as [[vaporized hydrogen peroxide]] (VHP), is another chemical sterilizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is a strong [[oxidant]], which allows it to destroy a wide range of pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is used to sterilize heat- or temperature-sensitive articles, such as rigid [[Endoscope|endoscopes]]. In medical sterilization, hydrogen peroxide is used at higher concentrations, ranging from around 35% up to 90%. The biggest advantage of hydrogen peroxide as a sterilant is the short cycle time. Whereas the cycle time for ethylene oxide may be 10 to 15 hours, some modern hydrogen peroxide sterilizers have a cycle time as short as 28 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aspjj.com/emea/products-and-services/low-temperature-sterilization/sterrad-nx|title= Sterrad NX|accessdate= 25 March 2015|website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawbacks of hydrogen peroxide include material compatibility, a lower capability for penetration and operator health risks. Products containing cellulose, such as paper, cannot be sterilized using VHP and products containing [[nylon]] may become brittle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/Disinfection_Nov_2008.pdf|title= Guidelines for Disinfection|date= 2008|accessdate= |website= |publisher= [[Center for Disease Control]]|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The penetrating ability of hydrogen peroxide is not as good as ethylene oxide{{citation needed|date= January 2013}} and so there are limitations on the length and diameter of the lumen of objects that can be effectively sterilized. Hydrogen peroxide is a primary irritant and the contact of the liquid solution with skin will cause [[Skin whitening|bleaching]] or [[ulceration]] depending on the concentration and contact time. It is relatively non-toxic when diluted to low concentrations, but is a dangerous oxidizer at high concentrations (&gt; 10% w/w). The vapour is also hazardous, primarily affecting the eyes and respiratory system. Even short term exposures can be hazardous and NIOSH has set the IDLH at 75 ppm,&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; less than one tenth the IDLH for ethylene oxide (800 ppm). Prolonged exposure to lower concentrations can cause permanent lung damage and consequently, OSHA has set the permissible exposure limit to 1.0 ppm, calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9992|title= 29 CFR 1910.1000 Table Z-1|accessdate= 25 March 2015|website= |publisher= [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterilizer manufacturers go to great lengths to make their products safe through careful design and incorporation of many safety features, though there are still workplace exposures of hydrogen peroxide from gas sterilizers documented in the FDA MAUDE database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/search.CFM |title=MAUDE - Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience |publisher=Accessdata.fda.gov |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using any type of gas sterilizer, prudent work practices should include good ventilation, a continuous gas monitor for hydrogen peroxide and good work practices and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/hydrogenperoxide/recognition.html |title=Occupational Safety and Health Guideline for Hydrogen Peroxide |publisher=Osha.gov |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MHMI/mmg174.html |title=ATSDR - MMG: Hydrogen Peroxide |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaporized hydrogen peroxide]] (VHP) is used to sterilize large enclosed and sealed areas, such as entire rooms and aircraft interiors.

Although toxic, VHP breaks down in a short time to water and oxygen.

===Peracetic acid===
[[Peracetic acid]] (0.2%) is a recognized sterilant by the FDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/ReprocessingofReusableMedicalDevices/ucm437347.htm|title= Cleared Sterilants and High Level Disinfectants with General Claims for Processing Reusable Medical and Dental Devices|date= March 2015|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use in sterilizing medical devices such as [[endoscope]]s.

===Potential for chemical sterilization of prions===
Prions are highly resistant to chemical sterilization. Treatment with [[aldehyde]]s, such as formaldehyde, have actually been shown to increase prion resistance. Hydrogen peroxide (3%) for one hour was shown to be ineffective, providing less than 3 logs (10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) reduction in contamination. [[Iodine]], formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and peracetic acid also fail this test (one hour treatment). Only [[chlorine]], [[phenols|phenolic compounds]], [[guanidinium thiocyanate]], and sodium hydroxide reduce prion levels by more than 4 logs; chlorine (too corrosive to use on certain objects) and sodium hydroxide are the most consistent. Many studies have shown the effectiveness of sodium hydroxide.&lt;ref name="Prion NaOH"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauman|first1=PA|author2=Lawrence LA |author3=Biesert L |author4=Dichtelmüller H |author5=Fabbrizzi F |author6=Gajardo R |author7=Gröner A |author8=Jorquera JI |author9=Kempf C |author10=Kreil TR |author11=von Hoegen I |author12=Pifat DY |author13=Petteway SR Jr |author14=MCai K|title=Critical factors influencing prion inactivation by sodium hydroxide.|journal=Vox Sang|date=July 2006|volume=91|issue=1|pages=34–40|pmid=16756599|doi=10.1111/j.1423-0410.2006.00790.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiation sterilization==
Sterilization can be achieved using [[electromagnetic radiation]], such as [[electron beam]]s, [[X-rays]], [[gamma rays]], or irradiation by [[subatomic particle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/iachem/publications.html Trends in Radiation Sterilization of Health Care Products], IAEA, Vienna,24 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Electromagnetic or particulate radiation can be energetic enough to ionize atoms or molecules ([[ionizing radiation]]), or less energetic ([[non-ionizing radiation]]).

===Non-ionizing radiation sterilization===
{{Further|Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation}}[[Ultraviolet]] [[light]] irradiation (UV, from a [[germicidal lamp]]) is useful for sterilization of surfaces and some transparent objects. Many objects that are transparent to [[visible light]] absorb UV. UV irradiation is routinely used to sterilize the interiors of [[biological safety cabinet]]s between uses, but is ineffective in shaded areas, including areas under dirt (which may become polymerized after prolonged irradiation, so that it is very difficult to remove). It also damages some plastics, such as [[polystyrene]] foam if exposed for prolonged periods of time.
===Ionizing radiation sterilization===
[[File:E-beam-x-ray-gamma-efficiency.jpg|thumb|Efficiency illustration of the different radiation technologies (electron beam, X-ray, gamma rays)]]

The safety of irradiation facilities is regulated by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency]] and monitored by the different national [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|Nuclear Regulatory Commissions]] (NRC). The radiation exposure accidents that have occurred in the past are documented by the agency and thoroughly analyzed to determine the cause and improvement potential. Such improvements are then mandated to retrofit existing facilities and future design.

[[Gamma Radiation|Gamma radiation]] is very penetrating, and is commonly used for sterilization of disposable medical equipment, such as syringes, needles, [[cannula]]s and IV sets, and food. It is emitted by a [[radioisotope]], usually [[cobalt-60]] (&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co) or [[caesium-137]] (&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs), which have [[photon]] energies of up to 1.3 and 0.66 [[MeV]], respectively.

Use of a radioisotope requires shielding for the safety of the operators while in use and in storage. With most designs, the radioisotope is lowered into a water-filled source storage pool, which absorbs radiation and allows maintenance personnel to enter the radiation shield. One variant keeps the radioisotope under water at all times and lowers the product to be irradiated in the water in hermetically-sealed bells; no further shielding is required for such designs. Other uncommonly used designs use dry storage, providing movable shields that reduce radiation levels in areas of the irradiation chamber. An incident in [[Decatur, Georgia]], US, where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool, requiring NRC intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/1989/in89082.html|title=NRC: Information Notice No. 89-82: Recent Safety-Related Incidents at Large Irradiators|website=www.nrc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to use of this radioisotope being almost entirely discontinued in favour of the more costly, non-water-soluble cobalt-60. Cobalt-60 gamma [[photon]]s have about twice the energy, and hence greater penetrating range, of caesium-137-produced radiation.

[[Electron beam processing]] is also commonly used for sterilization. [[Electron beams]] use an on-off technology and provide a much higher dosing rate than gamma or X-rays. Due to the higher dose rate, less exposure time is needed and thereby any potential degradation to polymers is reduced. Because [[Electron|electrons]] carry a charge, electron beams are less penetrating than both gamma and X-rays. Facilities rely on substantial concrete shields to protect workers and the environment from radiation exposure.

[[High-energy X-rays]] (produced by [[bremsstrahlung]]) allow irradiation of large packages and [[pallet]] loads of medical devices. They are sufficiently penetrating to treat multiple pallet loads of low-density packages with very good dose uniformity ratios. X-ray sterilization does not require chemical or radioactive material: high-energy X-rays are generated at high intensity by an [[X-ray generator]] that does not require shielding when not in use. X-rays are generated by bombarding a dense material (target) such as [[tantalum]] or [[tungsten]] with high-energy electrons, in a process known as bremsstrahlung conversion. These systems are energy-inefficient, requiring much more electrical energy than other systems for the same result.

[[Irradiation]] with X-rays, gamma rays, or electrons does not make materials [[radioactive]], because the energy used is too low. Generally an energy of at least 10 MeV is needed to [[induced radioactivity|induce radioactivity]] in a material.&lt;ref name="ThomadsenNath2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomadsen|first1=Bruce|last2=Nath|first2=Ravinder|last3=Bateman|first3=Fred B.|last4=Farr|first4=Jonathan|last5=Glisson|first5=Cal|last6=Islam|first6=Mohammad K.|last7=LaFrance|first7=Terry|last8=Moore|first8=Mary E.|last9=George Xu|first9=X.|last10=Yudelev|first10=Mark|title=Potential Hazard Due to Induced Radioactivity Secondary to Radiotherapy|journal=Health Physics|volume=107|issue=5|year=2014|pages=442–460|issn=0017-9078|doi=10.1097/HP.0000000000000139}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neutron|Neutrons]] and very high-energy particles can make materials radioactive, but have good penetration, whereas lower energy particles (other than neutrons) cannot make materials radioactive, but have poorer penetration.

Sterilization by irradiation with gamma rays may however affect material properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bharati |first= S |author2=Soundrapandian C |author3=Basu D |author4=Datta S |title= Studies on a novel bioactive glass and composite coating with hydroxyapatite on titanium based alloys: Effect of γ-sterilization on coating |journal= [[J.

Irradiation is used by the [[United States Postal Service]] to sterilize mail in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area. Some foods (e.g. spices and ground meats) are [[food irradiation|sterilized by irradiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:wZcjSTjqaYkJ:scholar.google.com/+food+sterilization+by+irradiation&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,33&amp;as_vis=1|title=Employing Ionizing Radiation to Enhance Food Safety – a Review The Purpose of Food Irradiation In recent decades, food irradia|website=scholar.googleusercontent.com|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subatomic particles may be more or less penetrating and may be generated by a radioisotope or a device, depending upon the type of particle.

==Sterile filtration==
Fluids that would be damaged by heat, irradiation or chemical sterilization, such as drug products, can be sterilized by [[microfiltration]] using [[membrane filter]]s. This method is commonly used for heat labile pharmaceuticals and [[protein]] solutions in medicinal drug processing. A microfilter with pore size 0.2 [[micrometre|µm]] will usually effectively remove [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="DeptHealth"&gt;

Smaller pore sizes lower the flow rate, so in order to achieve higher total throughput or to avoid premature blockage, pre-filters might be used to protect small pore membrane filters. [[Cross-flow filtration|Tangential flow filtration]] (TFF) and alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems also reduce particulate accumulation and blockage.

Membrane filters used in production processes are commonly made from materials such as mixed [[cellulose ester]] or [[polyethersulfone]] (PES). The filtration equipment and the filters themselves may be purchased as pre-sterilized disposable units in sealed packaging or must be sterilized by the user, generally by autoclaving at a temperature that does not damage the fragile filter membranes. To ensure proper functioning of the filter, the membrane filters are integrity tested post-use and sometimes before use. The nondestructive integrity test assures the filter is undamaged and is a regulatory requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/ucm070342.pdf|title= Guidance for Industry: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing|date= September 2004|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, terminal pharmaceutical sterile filtration is performed inside of a [[cleanroom]] to prevent contamination.

==Preservation of sterility==
[[File:Curette in sterile packaging.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[curette]] in sterile packaging.]]
Instruments that have undergone sterilization can be maintained in such condition by containment in sealed packaging until use.

[[Aseptic technique]] is the act of maintaining sterility during procedures.

'''Sublime Frequencies''' is a [[record label]] based in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] that focuses exclusively on "acquiring and exposing obscure sights and sounds from modern and traditional urban and rural frontiers," mostly from [[Southeast Asia]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].

The releases are usually divided into four categories: [[field recordings]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[pop music|pop]] compilations, radio collages from specific geographic locales, and [[DVD]]s. The label is headed by [[Alan Bishop]] and [[Hisham Mayet]]. Its releases are produced in limited quantities (usually 1,000 copies).

Its mission statement is:  Sublime Frequencies is a collective of explorers dedicated to acquiring and exposing obscure sights and sounds from modern and traditional urban and rural frontiers via film and video, field recordings, radio and short wave transmissions, international folk and pop music, sound anomalies, and other forms of human and natural expression not documented sufficiently through all channels of academic research, the modern recording industry, media, or corporate foundations. Sublime Frequencies is focused on an aesthetic of [[extra-geography]] and soulful experience inspired by music and culture, world travel, research.

In 2014 Sublime Frequencies created a [[Bandcamp]] page where listeners can listen to and purchase digital copies of some albums or individual tracks, including some previously sold-out albums. In 2016 E. Tammy Kim and Michael E. Veal published Punk Ethnography: Artists &amp; Scholars Listen to Sublime Frequencies which is a collection of interviews and essays about the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Veal|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Kim|editor2-first=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6510">{{for|the book by Marshall McLuhan|The Medium Is the Massage}}
{{Primary sources|date = July 2013}}"'''The medium is the message'''" is a phrase coined by [[Marshall McLuhan]] meaning that the form of a [[media (communication)|medium]] embeds itself in any [[message]] it would transmit or convey, creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived.

== Publications ==
The phrase was introduced in McLuhan's book ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'', published in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in 1964 by Mentor, New York; reissued 1994, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts with an introduction by [[Lewis H. Lapham|Lewis Lapham]]&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan proposes that a medium itself, not the content it carries, should be the focus of study. He said that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not only by the [[Content (media)|content]] delivered over the medium, but also by the characteristics of the medium itself.

McLuhan frequently punned on the word "message", changing it to "mass age", "mess age", and "massage"; a later book, ''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'' was originally to be titled ''The Medium is the Message'', but McLuhan preferred the new title, which is said to have been a [[The Medium Is the Massage#Origin of the title|printing error]].

Concerning the title, McLuhan wrote "The title “The Medium Is the Massage" is a teaser—a way of getting attention. There’s a wonderful sign hanging in a Toronto junkyard which reads, “Help Beautify Junkyards. Throw Something Lovely Away Today.” This is a very effective way of getting people to notice a lot of things. And so the title is intended to draw attention to the fact that a medium is not something neutral—it does something to people. It takes hold of them. It rubs them off, it massages them and bumps them around, chiropractically, as it were, and the general roughing up that any new society gets from a medium, especially a new medium, is what is intended in that title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McLuhan |first=Marshall |date=1967-03-19 |title=McLuhan: Now The Medium Is The Massage |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/03/19/107185353.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=179 |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==

For McLuhan, it was the medium itself that shaped and controlled "the scale and form of human association and action".&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the movie as an example, he argued that the way this medium played with conceptions of speed and time transformed "the world of sequence and connections into the world of creative configuration and structure."&lt;ref name="page-12"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the message of the movie medium is this transition from "lineal connections" to "configurations".&lt;ref name="page-12" /&gt;

Extending the argument for understanding the medium as the message itself, he proposed that the "content of any medium is always another medium"&lt;ref name="page-8"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; – thus, speech is the content of writing, writing is the content of print, and print itself is the content of the telegraph.

McLuhan understood "medium" in a broad sense. He identified the light bulb as a clear demonstration of the concept of "the medium is the message". A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."&lt;ref name="page-8" /&gt;

Likewise, the message of a newscast about a heinous crime may be less about the individual news story itself — the content — and more about the change in public attitude towards crime that the newscast engenders by the fact that such crimes are in effect being brought into the home to watch over dinner.&lt;ref name="Federman" /&gt;

Hence in ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan describes the "content" of a medium as a juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar  to distract the watchdog of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1964) Understanding Media, Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt; This means that people tend to focus on the obvious, which is the content, to provide us valuable information, but in the process, we largely miss the structural changes in our affairs that are  introduced subtly, or over long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Federman"&gt;Federman, M. (2004, July 23). What is the Meaning of the Medium is the Message? Retrieved &lt;Oct 9, 2008&gt; from http://individual.utoronto.ca/markfederman/article_mediumisthemessage.htm .&lt;/ref&gt; As society's values, norms, and ways of doing things change because of the technology, it is then we realize the social implications of the medium.  These range from cultural or religious issues and historical precedents, through interplay with existing conditions, to the secondary or tertiary effects in a cascade of interactions&lt;ref name="Federman" /&gt; that we are not aware of.

On the subject of [[art history]], McLuhan interpreted [[Cubism]] as announcing clearly that the medium is the message. For him, Cubist art required "instant sensory awareness of the whole"&lt;ref name="page-13"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than perspective alone. In other words, with Cubism one could not ask what the artwork was about (content),&lt;ref name="page-13" /&gt; but rather consider it in its entirety.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4864">'''Time-triggered architecture''' (abbreviated as '''TTA'''), also known as a '''time-triggered system''', is a computer system that executes one or more sets of tasks according to a pre-determined and set task schedule.&lt;ref name="PTTES"&gt;Pont, M.J. (2001) "Patterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems", Addison-Wesley / ACM Press.  {{ISBN|0-201-331381}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of a TT system will typically involve use of a single interrupt that is linked to the periodic overflow of a timer.  This interrupt may drive a task scheduler (a restricted form of [[real-time operating system]]).  The scheduler will{{mdashb}}in turn{{mdashb}}release the system tasks at predetermined points in time.&lt;ref name="PTTES"/&gt;

== History and development ==

Because they have highly deterministic timing behaviour, TT systems have been used for many years to develop [[safety-critical]] aerospace and related systems.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, N. J. (1991) "The static analysis of a safety-critical avionics control system", in Corbyn, D.E. and Bray, N. P. (Eds.) "Air Transport Safety: Proceedings of the Safety and Reliability Society Spring Conference, 1991" Published by SaRS, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of TT systems was popularised by the publication of ''Patterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems'' (PTTES) in 2001&lt;ref name="PTTES"/&gt; and the related introductory book ''Embedded C'' in 2002.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;Pont, M.J. (2002) "Embedded C", Addison-Wesley.  {{ISBN|0-201-79523-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The PTTES book also introduced the concepts of time-triggered hybrid schedulers (an architecture for time-triggered systems that require task pre-emption) and shared-clock schedulers (an architecture for distributed time-triggered systems involving multiple, synchronised, nodes).&lt;ref name="PTTES"/&gt;

Since publication of PTTES, extensive research work on TT systems has been carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Athaide, K.F., Pont, M.J. and Ayavoo, D. (2008) "Deploying a time-triggered shared-clock architecture in a multiprocessor system-on-chip design", in Proceedings of the 4th UK Embedded Forum (September 2008, Southampton, UK).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayavoo, D., Pont, M.J., Short, M. and Parker, S. (2007) "Two novel shared-clock scheduling algorithms for use with CAN-based distributed systems", Microprocessors and Microsystems, 31(5): 326–334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan, K.L. and Pont, M.J. (2010) "Real-time non-invasive detection of timing-constraint violations in time-triggered embedded systems", Proceedings of the 7th IEEE International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems, Bradford, UK, 2010, pp.1978–1986. Published by IEEE Computer Society. {{ISBN|978-0-7695-4108-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gendy, A.K. and Pont, M.J. (2008) "Automatically configuring time-triggered schedulers for use with resource-constrained, single-processor embedded systems", IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 4(1): 37–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Z.M. and Pont, M.J. (2008) "Reducing the impact of task overruns in resource-constrained embedded systems in which a time-triggered software architecture is employed", Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control, Vol. 30: pp.427–450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phatrapornnant, T. and Pont, M.J. (2006) "Reducing jitter in embedded systems employing a time-triggered software architecture and dynamic voltage scaling", IEEE Transactions on Computers, 55(2): 113–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current applications ==

Time-triggered systems are now commonly associated with international safety standards such as [[IEC 61508]] (industrial systems), [[ISO 26262]] (automotive systems), [[IEC 62304]] (medical systems) and [[IEC 60730]] (household goods).

== Alternatives ==

Time-triggered systems can be viewed as a subset of a more general event-triggered (ET) system architecture (see [[event-driven programming]]).

Implementation of an ET system will typically involve use of multiple interrupts, each associated with specific periodic events (such as timer overflows) or aperiodic events (such as the arrival of messages over a communication bus at random points in time).  ET designs are traditionally associated with the use of what is known as a [[real-time operating system]] (or RTOS), though use of such a software platform is not a defining characteristic of an ET architecture.&lt;ref name="PTTES"/&gt;

[[File:Pieter Janssens Elinga - Reading Woman - WGA7482.jpg|thumb|Elinga, ''Reading Woman,'' c. 1660]]
'''Women reading in art''' refers to any [[artistic work]] representing or portraying one or more women in the act of reading. This subject matter is quite common, with images appearing as early as the 14th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conlon|first=James|year=2005|title=Men Reading Women Reading: Interpreting Images of Women Readers|jstor=4137395|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=26|pages=37–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers are often exposed to a private, personal moments through these works. ''Reading Woman'' (c.1660) by [[Pieter Janssens Elinga|Pieter Janssans Elinga]] portrays reading as an intimate and introspective activity.

Beyond the exchange of ideas between author and reader, scholar James Conlon describes reading as an intimate and erotic subject, through the captivating book that touches and holds the reader's attention, and offers tactile pleasure in weight. As a result, then, the image of a woman reading becomes one of sexual subversion, and a source of fear for the male viewer or artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Western, patriarchal societies, Conlon argues, the act of reading takes a woman out of subservient role and into a context where personal pleasure, knowledge, and enjoyment is literally in her hands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Depictions of woman readers ==

[[File:Antoine_Wiertz_La_liseuse_de_romans.jpg|thumb|Antoine Wiertz, ''The Reader of Novels,'' c. 1853]]
During the 19th century, amidst a golden age for reading, concerns emerged about women's reading as jeopardizing marital and familial structures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Woman Reader|last=Jack|first=Belinda|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=228–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings and illustrations of the time reflected this fear that women would be seduced by books and neglect their domestic duties.  Other images implied the danger in tempting women with books as explicitly linked to their sexuality, like in [[Antoine Wiertz|Antoine Wiert's]]''The Reader of Novels'' (c.1853), where the figure of the devil literally supplies the female subject with pleasurable reading material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Claude_Monet_-_Springtime_-_Walters_3711.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Springtime (painting)|Springtime]]'', c. 1872]]
In [[Dutch Golden Age]] painting, female readers were depicted as part of the genre of the everyday, usually engaged with letters. [[Johannes Vermeer]], for example, created numerous works around this subject, including ''[[Woman in Blue Reading a Letter|A Woman in Blue Reading a Letter]]'' and ''[[Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window]]''. Despite this apparent acceptance of woman readers, scholars have determined that the letters including in Dutch painting were almost exclusively love letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/content/dam/ngaweb/Education/learning-resources/teaching-packets/pdfs/dutch_painting.pdf|title=Painting in the Dutch Golden Age: A Profile of the Seventeenth Century|last=|first=|date=2007|website=National Gallery of Art, Washington|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Conlon argues, the self-relective act of reading becomes conflated in these depictions with distraction and longing for someone - presumably a male lover - ultimately undermining the subjectivity of the woman reader.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Male artists have also depicted women readers within pastoral settings, like in [[Claude Monet]]'s ''[[Springtime (painting)|Springtime]]'', perhaps in an attempt to tame or domesticate the otherwise wild act of reading.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Female artists and the subject of reading ==

Female artists have also been drawn to the subject of women readers. These artists depictions of reading greatly differ from their male counterparts, demonstrating the complexity of the topic. [[Mary Cassatt]]'s ''Family Group Reading'' is a powerful representation of women readers who demonstrate subjectivity and serious literary engagement. All three are fixated on the text, and Cassat may be emphasizing that reading comes just as naturally to women as motherhood, by painting the young girl encircled by the woman's arms and drawn literally into the book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
