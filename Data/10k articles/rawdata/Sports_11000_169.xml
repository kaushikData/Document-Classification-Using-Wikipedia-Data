'''Blood-spinning''' is a [[medical procedure]] used to shorten the [[healing]] time of an [[injury]]. Small samples of the patient's [[blood]] are taken and spun in a [[centrifuge]], allowing [[platelet]]s and [[blood plasma]] to be isolated from other blood components. The platelets and plasma are then combined forming [[platelet-rich plasma]] (PRP), which has high concentrations of natural [[growth factor]]s. The PRP sample can then be injected into the patient's injury, which may help reduce pain and improve recovery speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.edu/newsroom_what-blood-spinning.asp |title=What Is Blood Spinning? |date=19 January 2010 |publisher=Hospital for Special Surgery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in professional sports ==
This procedure has been deemed controversial at times, especially when used by [[Sportsperson|athletes]]. In 2005, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] ruled that blood-spinning could be used to introduce banned substances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7375-rapid-healing-trick-falls-foul-of-antidoping-rules.html#.UeMhUEA4Ib4 |title=Rapid healing trick falls foul of anti-doping rules |date=14 May 2005 |publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 the agency went as far as banning the use of [[intramuscular injection]]s of PRP in competitive athletes amid some concerns that it boosted performance-enhancing growth factors.&lt;ref name=Borrione2010&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wasterlain AS, Braun HJ, Harris AH, Kim HJ, Dragoo JL |title=The systemic effects of platelet-rich plasma injection|journal=Am J Sports Med|volume=41|issue=1|pages=186–93|year=2013|pmid=23211708|doi=10.1177/0363546512466383}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that ban was lifted the following year, after it was concluded that there was a "lack of any current evidence concerning the use of these methods for purposes of performance enhancement".&lt;ref name=IMT2011&gt;{{cite news|title=World Anti-Doping Agency announces changes to Prohibited List|newspaper=[[Irish Medical Times]]|date=10 January 2011 |url=http://www.imt.ie/mims/2011/01/world-anti-doping-agency-announces-changes-to-prohibited-list-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate about the effectiveness of the procedure on improving healing times, with some doctors suggesting the evidence is inconclusive or contentious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Blood-spinning-promising-studies-inconclusive-3192445.php |title=Blood spinning promising; studies inconclusive |date=13 April 2010 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/jeremy-laurance-blood-spinning--legal-but-controversial-8471887.html |title=Blood spinning – legal but controversial |date=29 January 2013 |publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous professional athletes in a variety of sports have used blood-spinning to help recover from injuries, including [[professional tennis player]] [[Rafael Nadal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/rafael-nadal-learns-to-control-pain-in-fighting-back-to-no-1-again-8867473.html |title=Rafael Nadal learns to control pain in fighting back to No 1 again  |date=8 October 2013 |publisher=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[professional golfer]] [[Tiger Woods]], and former [[NFL]] player [[Hines Ward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304370304575151732675970098 |title=Spinning Blood Isn't Just for Athletes |date=30 March 2010 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is allowed by [[FIFA]] and has been used in the UK at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] during [[José Mourinho]]'s managerial stint at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/29/tottenham-sign-striker-jermain-defoe |title=Tottenham in market for striker while Jermain Defoe nurses muscle tear |date=29 January 2013 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chuncheon Civic Stadium''' ({{lang-ko|춘천공설운동장}}) was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] located in [[Chuncheon]], [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)|Gangwon-do]], South Korea. It was built in 1980 to hold [[Korean Junior Sports Festival]]. It also held [[Korean National Sports Festival]] twice, in 1985 and 1996. The stadium had a capacity of 35,000 people. In December 2008, because of the deterioration of its equipment, the stadium was demolished, and a new stadium, [[Chuncheon Stadium]], was built in another place.

==History==
The City Oval, then known as Alexandra Park, hosted its first [[first-class cricket]] match in 1894/95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffith |first=Peter D |url=http://sporttoday.org/5_acfffbb62bc20861_1.htm |title=South African First-Class Grounds |website=Sporttoday.org |date=1996-03-11 |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 1895 and 1957, the City Oval hosted 9 first-class matches between [[KwaZulu-Natal cricket team|Natal]] and [[Marylebone Cricket Club]].&lt;ref name="cricketarchive.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/23/1631_f.html|title=The Home of CricketArchive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground has been used to host many matches between South African A sides and touring cricket teams.&lt;ref name="ndtv.com" /&gt; First class matches were also played between Natal and Australians touring team in 1950 and 1958.&lt;ref name="cricketarchive.com" /&gt; In 2000, the City Oval hosted a [[List A]] match between [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]] and the South African Board President's XI; [[Charl Langeveldt]] took 5/7 as Bangladesh were bowled out for 51, and lost the match by 10 wickets.&lt;ref name="ndtv.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/70/70789.html|title=The Home of CricketArchive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Africa A cricket team|South Africa A]] have additionally played List A matches at the City Oval against [[Australia A cricket team|Australia A]] in 2002/03 and [[Sri Lanka A cricket team|Sri Lanka A]] in 2008/09.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/23/1631_a.html|title=The Home of CricketArchive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, City Oval hosted three youth ODIs between [[South Africa national under-19 cricket team|South Africa U-19 team]] and [[Bangladesh national under-19 cricket team|Bangladesh U-19 team]]; South Africa U-19 won 2 matches, and Bangladesh U-19 won one match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/23/1631_uo.html|title=The Home of CricketArchive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2003 Cricket World Cup ==
The City Oval has hosted two [[One Day International]] (ODI) matches, both of them in the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/23/1631_o.html|title=The Home of CricketArchive|publisher=Cricketarchive.com|accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015-hagley-oval-christchurch-all-set-to-become-the-100th-world-cup-venue-249248|title=ICC cricket World Cup 2015: Hagley Oval, Christchurch all set to become the 100th World Cup venue|work=Cricket Country}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to the World Cup, the ground was renovated, with the introduction of the Jubilee Stand, named to commemorate [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[diamond jubilee]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/01/1043804572216.html|title=The 15 World Cup venues|website=Theage.com|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first ODI at the ground was played between [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka cricket team|Sri Lanka]]. In the first over of the match, Sri Lankan [[Chaminda Vaas]] took 4 wickets, including a [[Hat-trick#cricket|hat-trick]] with the first three balls of the match, the first time this had occurred in international cricket.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nUOmzE4O1UEC&amp;pg=PT14&amp;lpg=PT14&amp;dq=city+oval+Pietermaritzburg+2003+world+cup&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZLFNZVD495&amp;sig=JIunA9hP8MPT_o3QEIqoe9kVBi0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig2vnkjJbKAhVEMhoKHZPJCW44HhDoAQg3MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=city%20oval%20Pietermaritzburg%202003%20world%20cup&amp;f=false| title= The Penguin Book Of South African Sports Trivia| last=O'Sullivan| first= David |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |date=September 2012 |access-date= 6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaas' wickets were [[Hannan Sarkar]] bowled off the first ball, [[Mohammed Ashraful]] [[caught and bowled]] off the second ball, [[Ehsanul Haque]] was caught by [[Mahela Jayawardene]] at [[slip (cricket)|slip]] off the third ball, and [[Sanwar Hossain]] off the fifth ball, making the score 5/4 from 1 over.&lt;ref name="espncricinfo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/126663.html|title=Fiery Vaas brings Bangladesh to their knees|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BC2jf1cWCJEC&amp;pg=PT13&amp;dq=Pietermaritzburg+cricket+ground&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy-6-fopbKAhXBXRQKHRlDDWg4FBDoAQgwMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Pietermaritzburg%20cricket%20ground&amp;f=false| title= The Extraordinary Book of SA Cricket| last1= O'Sullivan| first1=David| last2= McCallum| first2= Kevin| publisher= [[Penguin Books]]|date=September 2012 |access-date= 6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished with figures of 6/25 from 9.1 overs with 2 [[Over (cricket)|maidens]], as Sri Lanka beat Bangladesh by 10 wickets.&lt;ref name="espncricinfo.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ndtv.com" /&gt;

[[File:CyrileLoweJacquesDedet.png|thumb|Cyril Lowe, England's record try scorer from 1920 to 1989, tackled by Dedet in 1913 vs France|200px|right]]
The '''England rugby union try record progression''' charts the record number of tries scored for the [[England national rugby union team]] by individual players, or rugby footballers as they are still sometimes referred to.

==Early years==
The progression begins with [[Reg Birkett]]'s try, scored in the first international rugby match of any code in 1871 when England succumbed to Scotland at Raeburn Place. When Birkett's try was scored, it was not worth any points in itself, but rather afforded the opportunity of the scoring side to kick a goal, or a "try at goal", which England failed to convert. Birkett, who also played [[association football]] for [[England]], was for a short time during the match the joint international record holder as well, matching [[Angus Buchanan (rugby)|Angus Buchanan]]'s earlier effort for Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Bath, Richard (ed.) ''The Scotland Rugby Miscellany'' (Vision Sports Publishing Ltd, 2007 {{ISBN|1-905326-24-6}}, p37&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the record being but a single try, Birkett's mark of one try for England stood for almost six years, although this equated at the time to just ten matches. In that time, at least a further eleven players matched the feat of scoring a try for England before [[William Hutchinson (rugby union)|William Hutchinson]] scored his second try of the match and his career in the eleventh England match on 5 February 1877.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt; Hutchinson set a mark that was to last for exactly four years when [[Henry Taylor (rugby union)|Henry Taylor]], who had already equalled the record, scored three times against Ireland on 5 February 1881. Taylor played in the same side as another prolific scorer of tries, [[George Burton (rugby union)|George Burton]]. Burton equalled the mark of five tries in England's comprehensive victory over Wales in the latter's first international. In that match, on 19 February 1881, of the thirteen tries scored, Taylor scored once but Burton scored four times, which was in itself a record haul for one match that was to last until 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Bowker, ''England Rugby - A History of the National Side, 1871-1978'', p190, 1976 (Cassel Ltd)&lt;/ref&gt; The tries scored in this match brought both players to six apiece, but as to which of these players reached that mark first is unclear. It was not until 1885 that another pairing of prolific try scorers, [[Wilfred Bolton]] and [[Charles Wade]], both equalled the haul of six tries. Wade went on to hold the record outright for over fifteen years after he scored his seventh try on 2 January 1886 against Wales. It was [[Tot Robinson]] that was to break this record on 9 March 1901 with his mark of eight tries and no one challenged this until [[Arthur Hudson]] equalled and then broke it at [[Parc des Princes]] when England defeated France on 3 March 1910. For the third time, England was fielding a pairing of prolific try scorers, and alongside Hudson was [[John Birkett]]. John Birkett was the son of England's first try scorer, Reg Birkett and had scored the first try at [[Twickenham Stadium]]. He went on to set the England record with ten tries on 8 April 1912.

==Lowe's sixty-seven year record==
As Birkett's career finished, the young winger, [[Cyril Lowe]], began his. Lowe was selected to play for England whilst still at university in 1913 and despite a six-year break due to the [[First World War]] when he flew as a fighter pilot in the [[Royal Flying Corps]], returned to international duty and resumed scoring tries. Lowe scored eighteen times in twenty four appearances, and set the record for the most tries scored in a single [[Five Nations Championship]] when he scored eight in 1914, a record only matched by [[Ian Smith (Scottish rugby player born 1903)|Ian Smith]] of Scotland, and never surpassed, even in the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] era with its greater number of matches. Despite living until the age of 91,  Lowe's mark of eighteen tries, set on 10 February 1923, outlasted him and was not broken until another RAF fighter pilot, [[Rory Underwood]], scored his nineteenth try almost sixty-seven years later on 20 January 1990. Underwood had taken thirty-eight matches to reach this mark, compared to Lowe's twenty-four. Before Lowe, other try scorers had had better scoring ratios, amongst them record holders Burton scoring six in six, Wade seven in eight, Tot Robinson eight in eight, and Hudson, nine in eight. Daniel Lambert had also scored eight tries in a career of seven appearances.&lt;ref name="scrum"&gt;[http://stats.espnscrum.com/statsguru/rugby/stats/index.html?class=1;orderby=tries;team=1;template=results;type=player Espn scrum.com England player records]&lt;/ref&gt; Lowe's achievement has been singled out as being all the more remarkable due to the almost six year pause in the middle of his career.

==Underwood's unchallenged record==
Underwood went on to score thirty more tries for England over a career spanning twelve years and eighty-five matches, eventually setting a mark of forty-nine tries. He also scored once for the [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]], bringing his career total of international tries to fifty. Lowe's total of eighteen has been surpassed by a further six players, all playing in an era of many more internationals, and when tries are worth more points relative to other scoring methods and therefore where there is more emphasis on scoring tries. Underwood's mark, however, has never been challenged, the next closest for England being [[Will Greenwood]] and [[Ben Cohen (rugby union)|Ben Cohen]] on 31 each.

'''Estadio Rosas Pampa''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Huaraz]], [[Peru]]. It is currently used by the [[football (soccer)|football]] team [[Sport Áncash]] and [[Sport Rosario]]. The stadium's capacity is 18,000. [[Club Deportivo Municipal]] also played its games here until 1999 when they were relegated.

It is located in the region of the [[Callejón de Huaylas]] in the Ancash Region. It was inaugurated in 1945 and had only two stands (East and West). The stadium was renovated and the capacity increased to 18,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peru.com/futbol/autonoticias/futbolportada%5C2008%5C02%5C23%5Cdetallenoticia100998.asp |title=El estadio ‘Rosas Pampa’ de Huaraz cambia de cara |work=futbolperuano.com |accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done because Sport Áncash participated in its first [[Copa Sudamericana 2008|international competition]] in 2018. However, the stadium was not finished in time to host its home games for that competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peru.com/futbol/autonoticias/futbolportada%5C2008%5C03%5C13%5Cdetallenoticia101786.asp |title=Estadio Rosas Pampa de Huaraz quedó totalmente descartado para la Copa Sudamericana |work=futbolperuano.com |accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its improvements are roofed stands, four light towers, a scoreboard, a special drainage system, broadcast booths, and offices for other sports that are housed under the stands. It was reopened on August 8, 2010 with a match between Sport Áncash and [[Hijos de Acosvinchos]], in which the home side won 3-0.

The project cost [[Peruvian nuevo sol|S/.]] 35,219,426.

|name=Hart Memorial Trophy
|Image=Hhof hart.jpg
|Established=[[1923–24 NHL season|1924]]
|Holder=[[Taylor Hall]]&lt;br&gt;[[New Jersey Devils]]
|Awarded=[[Most Valuable Player]] in regular season of the [[National Hockey League]]}}
The '''Hart Memorial Trophy''', originally known as the '''Hart Trophy''', is awarded annually to the [[Most Valuable Player|"player judged most valuable to his team"]] in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The original trophy was donated to the league in 1923 by David Hart, the father of [[Cecil Hart]], the longtime head coach of the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. The Hart Trophy has been awarded 92 times to 56 different players since its beginnings in 1924. Each year, members of the [[Professional Hockey Writers' Association]] vote to determine the player who was the most valuable to his team during the regular season.

==History==
[[File: FrankNighbor.jpg|175px|thumb|left|The first winner of the original trophy, [[Frank Nighbor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/htmlSilverware/silver_splashhart.shtml|website=Official website of Hockey Hall of Fame|title=Hart Memorial Trophy|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Hart Memorial Trophy is named in honour of Canadian Dr. David Hart. Dr. Hart, who donated the original trophy to the NHL, was the father of [[Cecil Hart]], a former Coach and General Manager of the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. The trophy was first awarded at the conclusion of the [[1923–24 NHL season]] to [[Frank Nighbor]] of the [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]]. The original ''Hart Trophy'' was retired to the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1960, and the NHL began presenting a new trophy, which was dubbed the ''Hart Memorial Trophy'' in its place.{{sfn|Hollander|Bock|1970|p=311}} With the exceptions of [[Tommy Anderson (ice hockey)|Tommy Anderson]], [[Al Rollins]], and [[José Theodore]], every eligible player who won the Hart Trophy (and retired) has been inducted into the Hall of Fame. 

[[Wayne Gretzky]] won the award a record nine times during his career, eight consecutively. He has been named MVP more times than any other player in the history of the other three North American major professional leagues ([[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), [[National Basketball Association]], and [[National Football League]]). [[Barry Bonds]] is second, having won the MVP award seven times in the MLB. Gretzky and his [[Edmonton Oilers]] teammate [[Mark Messier]] are the only players to win the Hart Trophy with more than one team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=384579|title=99 Reasons Why Wayne Gretzky is "The Great One"|accessdate=January 1, 2012|work=[[National Hockey League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players from the [[Montreal Canadiens]] have won the award sixteen times; players from [[Boston Bruins]] are second with twelve winners, while the [[Edmonton Oilers]] have seen players win the award ten times. [[Joe Thornton]] became the only Hart Trophy winner to have switched clubs during his winning campaign during the [[2005–06 NHL season|2005–06 season]], having played for both the Bruins and [[San Jose Sharks]] that year. The defenseman with the most trophy victories is [[Eddie Shore]], who has four. By contrast, it is rare for a goaltender to win the award, which has happened only eight times in its history by 7 different goaltenders; Buffalo Sabres goaltender [[Dominik Hašek|Dominik Hasek]] is the only two-time winner.

The voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by members of the [[Professional Hockey Writers' Association]], and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10-7-5-3-1 point(s) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/jon_dolezar/news/2003/04/01/dolie_insider/ |title=Foppa shows the most Hart |archive-date=2007-12-05 |accessdate=August 4, 2016 |date=April 20, 2003 |dead-url=bot: unknown |last=Dolezar |first=Jon |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205164406/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/jon_dolezar/news/2003/04/01/dolie_insider/ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs. The closest the voting for the Hart Trophy has ever come was in the [[2001–02 NHL season|2001–02 season]], when [[José Théodore|Jose Theodore]] and [[Jarome Iginla]] tied in the total voting. The tiebreaker for choosing the Hart Trophy winner in such a case is number of first-place votes: Theodore claimed it, who had 86 first-place votes to Iginla's 82.&lt;ref name="HartNHL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=24934 |title=Hart Memorial Trophy|accessdate=July 11, 2014|work=[[National Hockey League]]}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the NHL's official online shop came under criticism after they placed a T-shirt advertising [[Alexander Ovechkin]] as the award winner on sale a week before the results were revealed. A spokesperson for the league said "in an effort to offer our fans the merchandise they want in a timely manner following an event such as the NHL Awards, our licensees prepare product for all possible outcomes. In this situation, the link for one of the possible products became live early through an error by our e-commerce provider."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=239912&amp;lid=headline&amp;lpos=secStory_nhl |title=Did NHL Shop Reveal Ovechkin as Hart Winner? |archive-date=2008-06-10 |accessdate=August 4, 2016 |date=June 6, 2008 |publisher=''[[The Sports Network]]'' |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610013137/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=239912&amp;lid=headline&amp;lpos=secStory_nhl |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ovechkin was later confirmed to be the winner.

The '''high jump''' is a [[track and field]] event in which competitors must jump unaided over a horizontal bar placed at measured heights without dislodging it. In its modern most practised format, a bar is placed between two standards with a crash mat for landing. In the modern era, athletes run towards the bar and use the [[Fosbury Flop]] method of jumping, leaping head first with their back to the bar. Since ancient times, competitors have introduced increasingly effective techniques to arrive at the current form.

The discipline is, alongside the [[pole vault]], one of two vertical clearance events to feature on the [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic athletics programme]]. It is contested at the [[World Championships in Athletics]] and [[IAAF World Indoor Championships]], and is a common occurrence at track and field meetings. The high jump was among the first events deemed acceptable for women, having been held at the [[Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympic Games]].

[[Javier Sotomayor]] (Cuba) is the current men's record holder with a jump of {{T&amp;Fcalc|2.45}} set in 1993&amp;nbsp;– the longest standing record in the history of the men's high jump. [[Stefka Kostadinova]] (Bulgaria) has held the women's world record at {{T&amp;Fcalc|2.09}} since 1987, also the longest-held record in the event.

==Rules==
[[File:Nicole Forrester.JPG|thumb|Canadian high jumper [[Nicole Forrester]] demonstrating the Fosbury flop]]

The rules for the high jump are set internationally by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF). Jumpers must take off on one foot. A jump is considered a failure if the bar is dislodged by the action of the jumper whilst jumping or the jumper touches the ground or breaks the plane of the near edge of the bar before clearance. The technique one uses for the jump must be almost flawless in order to have a chance of clearing a high bar.

Competitors may begin jumping at any height announced by the chief judge, or may pass, at their own discretion. Most competitions state that three consecutive missed jumps, at any height or combination of heights, will eliminate the jumper from competition.

The victory goes to the jumper who clears the greatest height during the final. Tie-breakers are used for any place in which scoring occurs. If two or more jumpers tie for one of these places, the tie-breakers are: 1) the fewest misses at the height at which the tie occurred; and 2) the fewest misses throughout the competition.

If the event remains tied for first place (or a limited advancement position to a subsequent meet), the jumpers have a jump-off, beginning at the next greater height. Each jumper has one attempt. The bar is then alternately lowered and raised until only one jumper succeeds at a given height.&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011023632/http://iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf |archivedate=October 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} iaaf rules&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:1912 Konstantinos Tsiklitiras2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Konstantinos Tsiklitiras]] during the standing high jump competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics]]
The first recorded high jump event took place in Scotland in the 19th century. Early jumpers used either an elaborate straight-on approach or a [[Scissors jump|scissors]] technique. In latter years, soon then after, the bar was approached diagonally, and the jumper threw first the inside leg and then the other over the bar in a scissoring motion. Around the turn of the 20th century, techniques began to change, beginning with the Irish-American [[Michael Sweeney (athlete)|Michael Sweeney's]] ''[[Eastern cut-off]]''. By taking off like the scissors and extending his spine and flattening out over the bar, Sweeney raised the world record to {{T&amp;Fcalc|1.97}} in 1895.

Another American, [[George Horine]], developed an even more efficient technique, the ''[[Western roll]]''. In this style, the bar again is approached on a diagonal, but the inner leg is used for the take-off, while the outer leg is thrust up to lead the body sideways over the bar. Horine increased the world standard to {{T&amp;Fcalc|2.01}} in 1912. His technique was predominant through the [[Berlin Olympics]] of 1936, in which the event was won by [[Cornelius Johnson (athlete)|Cornelius Johnson]] at {{T&amp;Fcalc|2.03}}.

American and Soviet jumpers were the most successful for the next four decades, and they pioneered the evolution of the [[straddle technique]]. Straddle jumpers took off as in the Western roll, but rotated their (belly-down) torso around the bar, obtaining the most efficient and highest clearance (of the bar) up to that time. Straddle-jumper, [[Charles Dumas]], was the first to clear 7 feet (2.13&amp;nbsp;m), in 1956, and American [[John Thomas (high jumper)|John Thomas]] pushed the world mark to {{T&amp;Fcalc|2.23}} in 1960. [[Valeriy Brumel]] took over the event for the next four years. The elegant Soviet jumper radically sped up his approach run, took the record up to {{T&amp;Fcalc|2.28}}, and won the Olympic gold medal in 1964, before a motorcycle accident ended his career.

[[File:1912 Platt Adams5.JPG|thumb|left|Platt Adams during the standing high jump competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics]]
American coaches, including two-time [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] champion Frank Costello of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], flocked to Russia to learn from Brumel and his coaches. However, it would be a solitary innovator at [[Oregon State University]], [[Dick Fosbury]], who would bring the high jump into the next century. Taking advantage of the raised, softer landing areas by then in use, Fosbury added a new twist to the outmoded Eastern Cut-off. He directed himself over the bar head and shoulders first, sliding over on his back and landing in a fashion which would likely have broken his neck in the old, sawdust landing pits. After he used this [[Fosbury flop]] to win the 1968 Olympic gold medal, the technique began to spread around the world, and soon ''floppers'' were dominating international high jump competitions. The last straddler to set a world record was [[Vladimir Yashchenko]], who cleared {{T&amp;Fcalc|2.33}} in 1977 and then {{T&amp;Fcalc|2.35}} indoors in 1978.

Among renowned high jumpers following Fosbury's lead were Americans [[Dwight Stones]] and his rival, {{convert|5|ft|8|in|order=flip}} tall [[Franklin Jacobs]] of Paterson, NJ, who cleared {{T&amp;Fcalc|2.32}},  {{convert|0.59|m}} over his head (a feat equalled 27 years later by Sweden's [[Stefan Holm]]); Chinese record-setters [[Ni Zhiqin|Ni-chi Chin]] and [[Zhu Jianhua]]; Germans [[Gerd Wessig]] and [[Dietmar Mögenburg]]; Swedish Olympic medalist and former world record holder [[Patrik Sjöberg]]; and female jumpers [[Iolanda Balaş]] of Romania, [[Ulrike Meyfarth]] of Germany and Italy's [[Sara Simeoni]].

==Technical aspects==

===The approach run===
[[File:Ruth Beitia Valence 2008.jpg|thumb|Spanish jumper [[Ruth Beitia]] approaching the bar from an angle]]
The approach run of the high jump may actually be more important than the take-off.  If a high jumper runs with bad timing or without enough aggression, clearing a high bar becomes more of a challenge.  The approach requires a certain shape or curve, the right amount of speed, and the correct number of strides.  The approach angle is also critical for optimal height.

Most great straddle jumpers have a run at angles of about 30 to 40 degrees.  The length of the run is determined by the speed of the person's approach.  A slower run requires about 8 strides.  However, a faster high jumper might need about 13 strides.  A greater run speed allows a greater part of the body's forward momentum to be converted upward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coachr.org/hj.htm|title=The HIGH JUMP|first=|last=CoachR|date=|website=www.coachr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''J''' type approach, favored by Fosbury floppers, allows for horizontal speed, the ability to turn in the air ([[centripetal force]]), and good take-off position. This allows for horizontal momentum to turn into vertical momentum, propelling the jumper off the ground and over the bar.  The approach should be a hard controlled stride so that a person does not fall from creating an angle with speed.  Athletes should run tall and lean on the curve, from the ankles and not the hips. This allows the correct angle to force their hips to rotate during take-off, which allows their center of gravity to pass under the bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_152_A_PageName_E_ArticleHighJumpApproach |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123060941/http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_152_A_PageName_E_ArticleHighJumpApproach |archivedate=November 23, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The take-off===

Unlike the classic straddle technique, where the take-off foot is "planted" in the same spot at every height, flop-style jumpers must adjust their take-off as the bar is raised. Their  approach run must be adjusted slightly so that their take-off spot is slightly further out from the bar in order to allow their hips to clear the bar while still maintaining enough momentum to carry their legs across the bar. Jumpers attempting to reach record heights commonly fail when most of their energy is directed into the vertical effort, and they brush the bar off the standards with the backs of their legs as they stall out in mid-air.

An effective approach shape can be derived from physics. For example, the rate of backward spin required as the jumper crosses the bar to facilitate shoulder clearance on the way up and foot clearance on the way down can be determined by computer simulation. This rotation rate can be back-calculated to determine the required angle of lean away from the bar at plant, based on how long the jumper is on the take-off foot. This information, together with the jumper's speed in the curve, can be used to calculate the radius of the curved part of the approach. This is a lot of work and requires measurements of running speed and time of take-off foot on the ground. However, one can work in the opposite direction by assuming an approach radius and watching the resulting backward rotation. This only works if some basic rules are followed in how one executes the approach and take-off. 
 
Drills can be practiced to solidify the approach.  One drill is to run in a straight line (the linear part of the approach) and then run two to three circles spiraling into one another.  Another is to run or skip a circle of any size, two to three times in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_307_A_PageName_E_ArticleGirouxHighJump |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123042035/http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/catalog/matriarch/OnePiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_307_A_PageName_E_ArticleGirouxHighJump |archivedate=November 23, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to train to leap upwards without first leaning into the bar, allowing the momentum of the '''J''' approach to carry the body across the bar.

== Winner declaration ==
In competition the winner is the person who cleared the highest height. In case of a tie, fewer failed attempts at that height are better: ''i.e.'', the jumper who makes a height on his or her first attempt is placed ahead of someone who clears the same height on the second or third attempt. If there still is a tie, all the failed attempts at lower heights are added up, and the one with the fewest total misses is declared the winner. If still tied, a playoff is held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/disciplines/jumps/high-jump "How it works".] iaaf.org. Retrieved 8 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting height is the next higher height after the overjumped one. If all the competitors clear the height, the bar is raised {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}}, and if they fail, the bar is lowered 2&amp;nbsp;cm. That continues until only one competitor succeeds in overjumping that height, and he or she is declared the winner.

* In the table below, dashes indicate that a height was not attempted, crosses indicate failed attempts, and circles indicate a cleared height. Jumpers '''A''' and '''D''' cleared 1.99&amp;nbsp;m but failed at 2.01&amp;nbsp;m. '''A''' wins this competition having cleared the winning height with two attempts, while jumper '''D''' required three attempts. Similarly, '''B''' is ranked ahead of '''C''', having cleared the decisive height (i.e., 1.97m) in the first attempt.

== Training ==
In high jump, it helps if the athlete is tall, has long legs, and limited weight on their body. They must have a strong lower body and flexibility helps a lot as well. High jumpers tend to go through very vigorous training methods to achieve this ideal body frame.

=== Sprinting ===
High jumpers must have a fast approach so it is crucial to work on speed and also speed endurance. Lots of high jump competitions may take hours and athletes must make sure they have the endurance to last the entire competition. Common sprint endurance workouts for high jumpers include 200-, 400-, and 800-meter training. Other speed endurance training methods such as hill training or a ladder workout may also be used.

=== Weight Lifting ===
It is crucial for high jumpers to have strong lower bodies and cores, as the bar progressively gets higher, the strength of an athlete's legs (along with speed and technique) will help propel them over the bar. [[Squat (exercise)|Squat]]s, [[deadlifts]], and core exercises will help a high jumper achieve these goals. It is important, however, for a high jumper to keep a slim figure as any unnecessary weight makes it difficult to jump higher.

=== Plyometrics ===
Arguably the most important training for a high jumper is [[plyometric]] training. Because high jump is such a technical event, any mistake in the technique could either lead to failure, injury, or both. To prevent these from happening, high jumpers tend to focus heavily on plyometrics. This includes hurdle jumps, flexibility training, skips, or [[scissors kick (strike)|scissor kick]] training. Plyometric workouts tend to be performed at the beginning of the workout.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.everythingtrackandfield.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/PBOnePieceView?storeId=10152&amp;catalogId=10753&amp;pagename=307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kangarootrackclub.org/high-jump-drills.html|title=High Jump Drills|first=|last=KangarooTrackClub.org|date=|website=www.kangarootrackclub.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hinsdale Greyhound Park''' was a [[greyhound racing]] track in [[Hinsdale, New Hampshire]], United States. It closed in 2008. It was originally '''Hinsdale Raceway''', a [[horse racing]] track that began operation in 1958. During its heyday it drew thousands of spectators from all over [[New England]] and even [[Montreal]]. [[Harness racing]] prospered at Hinsdale throughout the 1960s, '70s and early '80s, until track management, in an attempt to reduce costs, converted the facility to year-round greyhound racing. This was popular too for several years, but competition from casinos in neighboring states slowly eroded the fan base, and the last several years of operation were a financial struggle. In late 2008 the track finally succumbed and ceased operations under a mountain of debt.&lt;ref name=Republican&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Garry|title=Western Mass. fans regret passing of nearby greyhound race track|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/12/western_mass_fans_regret_passi.html|publisher=[[The Springfield Republican]]|accessdate=10 October 2012|date=29 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The racetrack was demolished a few years later.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the United States, [[college football]] has been played since the [[1869 college football season|1869 season]] when [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|Princeton and Rutgers played the first game]]. In the early years of the game, [[Harvard University]] and [[McGill University]] developed a rivalry that is credited with the establishment of modern [[American football]].&lt;ref name="1874MG-HU1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=McLean |title=Montreal Cup float recalls how McGill started grid mania |page=16 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X4IuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=harvard%20mcgill%20football&amp;pg=943%2C6513069 |publisher=Google News Archives |newspaper=The Gazette |date=November 27, 1970 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1874MG-HU2"&gt;{{cite news |first=D.A.L. |last=MacDonald |title=McGill and Harvard have been rivals for 59 years |page=13 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fEowAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TKgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=harvard%20mcgill%20football%201874&amp;pg=5365%2C2850517 |publisher=Google News Archives |newspaper=The Gazette |date=December 22, 1933 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1874MG-HU3"&gt;{{cite news |title=Early football |page=4 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MnMzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z-MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=harvard%20mcgill%20football%201874&amp;pg=1106%2C5266575 |publisher=Google News Archives |newspaper=The Evening News |date=November 13, 1915 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first game played outside the United States occurred on October 23, 1874, when the [[1874 Harvard Crimson football team|Crimson]] defeated McGill 3–0 at [[Montreal]], Quebec.&lt;ref name="1874MG-HU1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1874MG-HU3"/&gt; Several other games were played during the early years of the game in Canada until the differences between [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]] became significant enough that Canadian and American universities ceased playing one-another.&lt;ref name="1874MG-HU3"/&gt; In addition to the early Canadian games, several teams competed in the [[Bacardi Bowl]] at [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] until it was discontinued after the 1946 edition of the game.&lt;ref name="Bacardi"&gt;{{cite news |title=International Bowl results |url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/10522724 |publisher=CBSSports.com |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not common, [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) rules allow for member institutions to compete in regular season games scheduled in foreign countries no more than once every four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D110.pdf |title=17.9.5.1.1 In season foreign competition |pages=240–241 |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) |work=2009–10 NCAA Division I Manual |publisher=NCAA.org |accessdate=October 24, 2013 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these games occurred in 1976 when [[Grambling State Tigers football|Grambling State]] defeated [[Morgan State Bears football|Morgan State]] in the Pioneer Bowl at [[Korakuen Stadium]] in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="GSU761"&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Grambling is winner |page=11 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZRZcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IFUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=grambling%20tokyo&amp;pg=4506%2C3164483 |publisher=Google News Archives |newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator |date=September 25, 1976 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that initial game, a regular season game called the Mirage Bowl (later called the [[Coca-Cola Classic (college football)|Coca-Cola Classic]]) was played in Tokyo from 1977 to 1993.&lt;ref name="NCAA118"&gt;Bowl/All-Star Game Records, pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1977, regular season games have also been played in [[Australia]], [[Bermuda]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="NCAA118"/&gt;

In April 2006, the NCAA announced [[Toronto]] was awarded a postseason [[bowl game]] to be played at [[Rogers Centre]].&lt;ref name="Tor2006"&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Birmingham among 31 approved by NCAA for 2006 |page=D6 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_3spAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z9gEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=international-bowl%20toronto&amp;pg=4069%2C2990610 |publisher=Google News Archives |newspaper=The Gadsden Times |date=April 28, 2006 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Bowl]] was the first bowl game played outside the United States since the Bacardi Bowl in 1937.&lt;ref name="Bacardi"/&gt; However, the game was discontinued after its [[2010 International Bowl|2010 edition]].&lt;ref name="Tor2010Dis"&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=International Bowl canceled |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5028869 |publisher=ESPN.com |date=March 25, 2010 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two international games were played as part of the [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season]]. [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] and [[UCF Knights football|UCF]] played their season opener in the Croke Park Classic at [[Dublin]], and the [[Bahamas Bowl]] had its inaugural edition at [[Thomas Robinson Stadium]] in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in December 2014 and its second edition on December 24, 2015.&lt;ref name="2014Ire"&gt;{{cite news |first=Josh |last=Moyer |title=Penn St.–UCF set for Ireland opener |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9476854/penn-state-nitttany-lions-play-ucf-knights-dublin-ireland |publisher=ESPN.com |date=July 24, 2013 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bahamas"&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=College football is Bahamas bound for bowl game |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/10/14/college-football-is-bahamas-bound-for-bowl-game/2979675/ |newspaper=USA Today |publisher=USAToday.com |date=October 14, 2013 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahamas Bowl has continued as part of the bowl schedule ever since. Two regular-season games were scheduled for 2016: the first game of the season, with [[California Golden Bears football|California]] and [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football|Hawai{{okina}}i]] playing at [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]] in [[Sydney]], and a return to Dublin's Aviva Stadium, this time with [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]] playing [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]].

In addition to those played, several international games have been proposed from time-to-time that were never actually played. In 1989, [[1989 USC Trojans football team|USC]] and [[1989 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]] were scheduled to open their season in the [[Glasnost Bowl]] at [[Dynamo Stadium (Moscow)|Dynamo Stadium]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="Glasnost"&gt;{{cite news |title=Glasnost Bowl is nyet for Moscow |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1989-06-09/sports/8906090277_1_raycom-glasnost-moscow |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |publisher=OrlandoSentinel.com |date=June 9, 1989 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the game was canceled and moved to the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] due to the logistics of undertaking a college football game in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Glasnost"/&gt; In 1996, the [[Haka Bowl]] was scheduled for play at [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], but its certification was subsequently revoked by the NCAA due to financing concerns.&lt;ref name="Haka"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jake |last=Curtis |title=NCAA pulls the plug on Haka Bowl |url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/NCAA-Pulls-The-Plug-on-Haka-Bowl-2962951.php |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=SFGate.com |date=October 17, 1996 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, bowl games were proposed for both [[Dublin]], Ireland and [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]], but neither was certified by the NCAA for play.&lt;ref name="Other"&gt;{{cite news |first=Brett |last=McMurphy |title='Group of Five' look to add bowls |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9364692/smaller-conferences-look-add-bowl-games-sources |publisher=ESPN.com |date=June 12, 2013 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rosli bin Haji Liman''' is a retired [[Brunei]]an international [[association football|footballer]] who played for the [[Brunei (Malaysia Premier League team)|Brunei M-League representative team]] as a [[Midfielder (association football)|midfielder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei to host night of legends|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2010/09/25/brunei-host-night-legends|date=25 September 2010|publisher=[[The Brunei Times]]|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having appeared for the Wasps since 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19880820&amp;id=1VlPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FJADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2957,1013425&amp;hl=en|title=Quick-fire Din Stuns Brunei|via=Google News Archive Search|publisher=[[New Straits Times]]|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosli was one of the mainstays of the Brunei M-League team in the nineties along with the two keepers [[Yunos Yusof|Hj. Md. Yunos]] and [[Ibrahim Abu Bakar]], centre-back [[Liew Chuan Fue]] and [[Rosanan Samak]]. He was the engine of the team and his late runs from midfield contributed goals to a modestly-performing Brunei side that was often faced with adversity. This was outlined in ''FIFA 192: The True Story Behind the Legend of Brunei Darussalam National Football Team'', a book by British author Stanley Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Park |first=Stanley |date=September 15, 2004 |title=FIFA 192: The True Story Behind the Legend of Brunei Darussalam National Football Team |publisher=[[Universal Publishers (United States)|Universal Publishers]] |isbn=978-1581125085}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 4 December 1999, Rosli scored twice in the final of the [[Malaysia Cup]], winning Brunei's first silverware in 20 years since joining the [[M-League System|Malaysian leagues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19991205&amp;id=av1OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fRQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5919,3709395&amp;hl=en|title=Rosli Double Gives Brunei The Cup|via=Google News Archive Search|publisher=New Straits Times|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brace was notable not only for its significance to Bruneian football but that he had not scored all season and the winner came as [[Sarawak FA|Sarawak's]] equalising goal by [[Ramles Sari]] was still being announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19991205&amp;id=av1OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fRQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2733,3710373&amp;hl=en|title=Deadly Double, The First Of The Season|via=Google News Archive Search|publisher=New Straits Times|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7i8RiLx40&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosli played for one more season with a depleted Brunei side that was relegated to Premier Two, but was forced to retire at 30 years of age due to a recurring knee problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=M-League - Operation 'Promotion' kicks off|url=http://www.e-borneo.com/cgi-bin/np/viewnews.cgi?category=2&amp;id=986790200|date=9 April 2001|publisher=[[Borneo Bulletin]]|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Rosli played in all four group matches at the [[Football at the 1999 Southeast Asian Games|1999 SEA Games]] held in his country [[Brunei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South East Asian Games 1999 Details (Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei)|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/sea99-det.html|date=26 April 2002|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last appearances for the [[Brunei national football team|Brunei national team]] came at the [[2000 AFC Asian Cup qualification#Group 10|2000 AFC Asian Cup qualifying round]].

[[File:Deck Shuffleboard.JPG|thumb|275px|A shuffleboard game being prepared on a ship's deck]]

'''Shuffleboard''', more precisely '''deck shuffleboard''', and also known  as '''floor shuffleboard''', is a [[game]] in which players use cues to push weighted discs, sending them gliding down a narrow court, with the purpose of having them come to rest within a marked scoring area. As a more generic term, it refers to the family of shuffleboard-variant games as a whole.

== History ==
The full history of shuffleboard is not known. Though there is some knowledge of its development, its actual origins, the place and date where it was first played, remain a mystery. Inevitably, this uncertainty gives rise to some debate, even disagreement, about which country can claim to have invented it. However there is no dispute concerning its age as a form of popular amusement, and in [[Europe]] has a history that goes back over 500 years.

The game was played and gambled over by King [[Henry VIII of England]], who prohibited [[commoner]]s from playing; evidently he did not always win, as the record of royal expenses for 1532 show a payment from the [[Privy Purse]] of [[Pound sterling|GB£]]9, 'Paied to my lord Wylliam for that he wanne of the kinges grace at shovillaborde' (today's spelling:  'Paid to Lord William, for he won, by the king's grace, at shovelboard').

In its goals, form and equipment, shuffleboard shares various features with (and perhaps influences by or upon) many other games, including [[air hockey]], [[bowls]], [[bocce]], [[curling]], [[croquet]], [[carrom]] and [[billiards]].  Historically, the ancient shovelboard, about which little is known, appears to have diverged into modern shuffleboard and [[Table shuffleboard#Sjoelen|sjoelen]], and with the former leading to the development of both [[table shuffleboard]] and [[shove ha'penny]].&lt;ref name="TradeGames2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Shove-HaPenny.htm |title=Shove Ha'penny: History and Useful Information|work=The Online Guide to Traditional Games|accessdate=2007-09-22|first=James|last=Masters|year=1997|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, due to its popularity on [[cruise ship]]s and in [[retirement home]]s because of its low physical fitness requirements, the deck game is often associated with the elderly, though it is increasingly popular among younger generations. Its [[Table shuffleboard|miniaturized tabletop variant]] is very popular in [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] and [[Public house|pubs]].

== Game play ==
In ''deck'' or ''floor'' shuffleboard, players use a ''cue'' (''cue-stick''), to push their colored ''disks'', down a ''court'' (a flat floor of concrete, wood or other hard material, marked with lines denoting scoring zones), attempting to place their disks within a marked scoring area at the far end of the court. The disks themselves are of two contrasting colors (usually yellow and black), each color belonging to a player or team. The scoring diagram is divided by lines, into six scoring zones, with the following values: 10, 8, 8, 7, 7, 10-off. (See ''Court Description'' below for details.) After  8 disks (four per team, taking alternating shots) have been played from one end of the court (a ''frame''), the final score values of disks for each player (or team) in the scoring zones is assessed: If a disk is completely within a scoring zone without touching (overlapping) any part of the border-line of the zone, it is ''good'' and that zone value is added to the correct player's score for the frame, and then to the player's total points. Both players good disks are added to their respective scores (As opposed to being subtracted to give only one player a net score for a frame.) Players (or teams of two players, one at each end) take turns going first during a game, so that the advantageous last shot of a frame (the ''hammer'') also alternates between players. The winner of the game may be the first to reach any total decided upon, or may be the higher score after playing a certain number of frames (e.g. 8, 12 or 16).  There is also the 'first to 75-points' game. Ties are broken by playing extra frames (two for singles, four for doubles).
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-shuffleboard.org/index.php/shuffleboard-playing-rules International Tournament Rules&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategy ===
In shuffleboard, one tries to score, prevent the opponent from scoring, or both. 
The basic strategy involves both offense and defense. If it is your turn to shoot first, you are automatically on the defensive, because your opponent has the last shot of the frame. If you simply put your first shot into the scoring area, your opponent will knock it off, and if you then score with your second shot, the same will happen, and so on until you have used your last shot, and your opponent will knock that off and probably score. To combat this you can use the strategy of blocking and hiding – That is your first shot will be a guard disk shot to a location so that it blocks your opponent from that part of the scoring area that you can still place a good disk. Your second shot will be the one to play into that hiding place you created with your first shot, so your opponent cannot hit you out directly.

=== Court description ===
[[File:Shuffleboard.svg|thumb|center|700px|Top view of a shuffleboard]]

[[File:Shuffleboard scoring area.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A close up of the scoring triangle]]

Dimensions of a floor shuffleboard court can vary to suit available space, but an official shuffleboard court is 6 feet wide by 39 feet in length plus a 6-foot shooting area at each end.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Typically a scoring zone is painted at each end of the court to reduce set-up time between games. Each scoring zone comprises an [[isosceles triangle]] 6 feet × 9 feet with the short edge away from the shooter. Behind the scoring zone is the ''10-off'' zone, an area 1½ feet deep. The court surface is usually a uniform dark green; lines are 1 inch wide except for the mid-shooting area. One-inch white lines form the scoring triangle and FURTHER divide the triangle into the separate scoring zones. Line width is not considered in court dimensions given here. The court is the same from each end. (A) 6 feet for Player Shooting Area; A line called the Baseline crosses the entire court and extends to the adjacent court on each side if any; (B) 10-off area – 1 1/2 feet. The sides of the 10-Off area are defined by two lines running at the same angle as the Scoring Triangle; The ''Back-7 Line'' crosses the entire court. (C) A ''center-line'' runs from the middle of the Back-7-line up the middle of the court for 6 feet. The two ''7'' score zones are located on each side of the Center-Line, for a length of 3 feet, bounded at the top by the ''Back-8'' line, running side to side across and within the scoring triangle; (D) The two ''8'' scoring zones are located one each side of the center-line for a length of 3 feet, bounded at the top by the ''Top-8'' line running side to side across and within the scoring triangle, and forming a ''T'' with the end of the center-line.  (E) The ''10'' scoring zone is at the peak of the overall scoring triangle, and is 3 feet in height, from the Top-8 line to the peak of the triangle. A further ''dead-line'' or ''lag-Line'' runs from side to side 12 feet from the base-line (The dead-line is therefore 3 feet from the tip of the triangle). There are two dead-lines, 12 feet apart. Any shot disk that does not cross or touch the furthest dead-line is then simply removed from the court (a wasted shot).

=== Equipment ===
Disks: Modern floor shuffleboard is played with 8 round, hard, durable 6 inch diameter plastic disks – New disks are about 1" in thickness, weighing 15 ounces. There should be four (4) discs of a light color, usually yellow, and four of a dark color, usually black. These eight (8) discs comprise a set. (Other colored combinations may be used, but ''black'' and ''yellow'' will be used here.) One player or team uses the yellow disks, the other player or team, the black disks.
Cue-Sticks: Each player uses a ''cue'' (''cue-stick'') to push their disks down the court to the opposite end. The cue length is six feet, three inches (6'3") or less, with hard plastic feet on the end (metal would damage the court surface).
Scoreboard: There are two basic types (1) – ''Resort Type'' uses two sliders that can move up and down a numbered scale, like a thermometer, with values running from zero at the bottom to 75 at the top (First to 75 points is a common shuffleboard game). Each team used their own slider to record their total score.  The advantages of the Resort-type include simplicity, durable and weather proof, needs no other items such as chalk or eraser. The disadvantage is that scoring mistakes are impossible to determine, and a frames played cannot be tracked unless a separate recording method (e.g. pen and paper) is used.(2)- Blackboard (Whiteboard) Type is ruled with four or eight horizontal lines and each teams total score is written after each frame, yellow on the left and black on the right. When all the lines have been filled with scores the top lines are erased and scores are again written from  the top. The advantage of the blackboard type is that mistakes in adding and recording the score are easier to spot, because previous scores should always be seen. As well, it is easy to keep track of frames played using small numbers written down the scoreboard.

Courts are available for use on residential decks or on any solid flat surface, in the form of roll-out plastic mats, or  adjustable arrays of plastic tiles.  With the tile courts, the dimensions can be adapted to the space available; e.g. it is possible to play on a court {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}} by {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|wide}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2007}} The roll-out mats are available in two sizes, {{convert|39|x|6|ft|m}} and {{convert|27|x|4.5|ft|m}}. The smaller mats are designed to fit on a domestic patio or driveway.{{citation needed|date=September 2007}} The biscuit and tang are the same standard size, regardless which court size is used.

== International Shuffleboard Association ==

The ISA was founded March 10, 1979, in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. The ISA was designed to make shuffleboard more popular in countries outside the North American continent, and to foster shuffleboard through international competitions. In 1981 in [[Muskegon, Michigan]] the first ISA Team World Championships were held, starting with teams from Canada, the USA and Japan only. [[Australia]] (1991), [[Brazil]] (1997), [[Germany]] (2006), [[Norway]] (2011) and lately [[Russia]] (2013) joined the World Championships, which take place yearly and last for one week.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-shuffleboard.org/index.php/shuffleboard-isa/49-welcome-to-the-home-of-international-shuffleboard&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ISA, Declan hosts an international competition biannually.

== Table shuffleboard variants ==
{{Main|Table Shuffleboard}}

In table shuffleboard, the play area is most commonly a wooden or laminated surface covered with silicone beads (colloquially called 'shuffleboard wax') to reduce friction. In the United States, a long, narrow 22&amp;nbsp;ft table is most commonly used, though tables as short as 9&amp;nbsp;ft are known.

Players try to slide metal-and-plastic pucks, sometimes called weights or shuckles, to come to rest within zones at the other end of the board. Cues are not used, the pucks being propelled with the hands directly on the raised table. There are scoring zones at each end of the table so that direction of play can rotate after each frame, or so that teams can play both directions during one frame. More points are awarded for weights scoring closer to the far edge of the board. Players take turns sliding the pucks, trying to score points, bump opposing pucks off the board, and/or protect their own pucks from bump-offs.  The long sides of the table are bounded by gutters into which pucks can fall or be knocked (in which case they are no longer in play for the remainder of the frame). A variant known sometimes as [[bankboard]] has rubber cushions or 'banks' running the length of both sides of the table, instead of gutters, and as in [[Cue sports|billiards]], the banks can be used to gain favorable position. A common and even smaller-scale [[United Kingdom|British]] tabletop variant is [[shove ha'penny]], played with coins, while a somewhat larger wooden-puck variant called ''[[Table shuffleboard#Sjoelen|sjoelen]]'', which has much in common with the ball games [[bagatelle]] and [[skeeball]], is played principally in the [[Netherlands]].

=== Object of the game ===
The objective of the game is to slide, by hand, all four of one's Weights alternately against those of an opponent, so that they reach the highest scoring area without falling off the end of the board into the alley. Furthermore, a player's Weight(s) must be farther down the board than his opponent's Weight(s), in order to be in scoring position. This may be achieved either by knocking off the opponent's Weight(s), or by outdistancing them. Horse collar, the most common form of the game, is played to either 15 or, more typically, 21. Only the weights in front score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccluretables.com/t-Shuffleboard_Game_Rules.aspx|title=Shuffleboard Game Rules – McClure Tables|website=www.mccluretables.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Albanian Spartakiad''' was an event similar to the [[Spartakiad|USSR Spartakiad]] and to the [[Spartakiad (Czechoslovakia)|Czechoslovakian Spartakiad]]. Six such events had been held in [[Albania]] during Communist rule (in 1959, 1969, 1974, 1979, 1984, and 1989).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iliriadaportal.com/opinion-f34/lindja-zhdukja-dhe-rilindja-e-olimpizmit-shqiptar-t1669.htm]{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/cup.html|title=Unofficial Site of Albanian Football since 1913: Republic Cup, Supercup, National Spartakiada and Under 18/19 Championships|website=www.giovanniarmillotta.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spartakiad included a mass gymnastics display, professional and amateurial sports championships. It was the biggest sports event in Albania during communist rule as included hundreds of thousands of participants.

'''West Horsley''' is a semi-rural village between [[Guildford]] and [[Leatherhead]] in Surrey, England. It lies on the [[A246 road|A246]], and south of the [[M25 motorway|M25]] and the [[A3 road|A3]]. Its [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] ascends to an [[ancient woodland]] [[Sheepleas]] Woods which are on the northern downslopes of the ridge of hills known as the [[North Downs]] in the extreme south of the village, and cover about a tenth of its area, 255 acres (1&amp;nbsp;km²).  The bulk of West Horsley's land is north of the [[Surrey Hills AONB]], the rest is within it.

==History==
West Horsley appears in [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Orselei'' held by Walter, son of Othere. Its Domesday assets were: 8 [[hide (unit)|hide]]s; 1 church, 8 [[plough]]s, [[woodland]] worth 20 [[hog (swine)|hog]]s. It rendered £6 each year to its [[feudal system|lords of the manor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm Surrey Domesday Book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715015325/http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm |date=15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Horsleys were burnt to the ground during the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] of 1066 since its Saxon thane, Brixsi, was brother-in-law to [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold]] and refused to submit. The village was part of the lands given to the Norman, Walter Fitz Otha, the new [[Constables and Governors of Windsor Castle|constable of Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population fell dramatically during the [[Black Death]] and the land was given over to grazing, since the peasant population was insufficient for farming.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1636, during a court case concerning a tithe dispute, a witness called Henry Mabbinck testified that he played [[cricket]] "in the Parke" at West Horsley, one of the sport's earliest references.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, pp. 261–267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/main.html |title=From Lads to Lord's; The History of Cricket: 1300 – 1787 |publisher=Stumpsite |first=John |last=Leach |date=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629134518/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/main.html |archivedate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beatrix Potter]], best-selling author of children's books, used to stay at a cottage in the village, Tyrrellswood with her uncle and aunt, and did many of her paintings of animals and wrote some of her books there. [[Helen Allingham]] painted a country thatched cottage images of England in the village in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Allingham_Helen_Children_On_A_Path_Outside_A_Thatched_Cottage_West_Horsley_Surrey.jpg Children On A Path Outside A Thatched Cottage, West Horsley, Surrey] Helen Allingham (1848–1926)&lt;/ref&gt;
